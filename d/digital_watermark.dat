40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> is {{the process}} of hiding the {{important}} digital information into another one. There are three main <b>watermarking</b> techniques, <b>Digital</b> image <b>watermarking,</b> <b>digital</b> audio <b>watermarking</b> and <b>digital</b> video <b>watermarking.</b> Watermarking can be done majorly in two domains, Spatial Domain and Frequency Domain. This paper is analysis of <b>Digital</b> image <b>watermarking</b> and different techniques used for <b>digital</b> image <b>watermarking</b> in Spatial Domain based on LSB-Based, Statistical-Based, Feature-Based and Block-Based...|$|R
25|$|The {{information}} to be embedded in a signal is called a <b>digital</b> <b>watermark,</b> although in some contexts the phrase <b>digital</b> <b>watermark</b> means {{the difference between the}} watermarked signal and the cover signal. The signal where the watermark is to be embedded is called the host signal. A watermarking system is usually divided into three distinct steps, embedding, attack, and detection. In embedding, an algorithm accepts the host and the data to be embedded, and produces a watermarked signal.|$|E
25|$|A <b>digital</b> <b>watermark</b> {{is called}} semi-fragile if it resists benign transformations, but fails {{detection}} after malignant transformations. Semi-fragile watermarks commonly {{are used to}} detect malignant transformations.|$|E
25|$|A <b>digital</b> <b>watermark</b> {{is called}} robust if it resists a {{designated}} class of transformations. Robust watermarks {{may be used}} in copy protection applications to carry copy and no access control information.|$|E
30|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> is a {{technique}} that embeds additional data into digital contents so that the distortion by embedding them is perceptually undetectable [1]. The distortion of watermarked images by general <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> methods is fixed only after embedding. Some <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> methods [2] prevent the degradation of the image quality of watermarked images by using human visual system. However the lower limit of the image quality of the watermarked images was not clear. Such obscurity of the lower limit disturbs the practical use of <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} to protect the copyright of media signals. This chapter aims to provide a universal review and background about the watermarking definition, concept and the main contributions in this field. The chapter starts with a general view of digital data, the Internet and the products of these two, namely, the multimedia and the e-commerce. Then, it provides the reader with some initial background and history of <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking.</b> The chapter presents an extensive and deep literature review of the field of <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> and watermarking algorithms. It also highlights the future prospective of the <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking...</b>|$|R
25|$|Like {{traditional}} physical watermarks, digital watermarks {{are often}} only perceptible under certain conditions, i.e. after using some algorithm. If a <b>digital</b> <b>watermark</b> distorts the carrier signal {{in a way}} that it becomes easily perceivable, it may be considered less effective depending on its purpose. Traditional watermarks may be applied to visible media (like images or video), whereas in digital watermarking, the signal may be audio, pictures, video, texts or 3D models. A signal may carry several different watermarks at the same time. Unlike metadata that is added to the carrier signal, a <b>digital</b> <b>watermark</b> does not change the size of the carrier signal.|$|E
25|$|A <b>digital</b> <b>watermark</b> {{is called}} robust {{with respect to}} transformations if the {{embedded}} information may be detected reliably from the marked signal, even if degraded by any number of transformations. Typical image degradations are JPEG compression, rotation, cropping, additive noise, and quantization. For video content, temporal modifications and MPEG compression often are added to this list. A <b>digital</b> <b>watermark</b> is called imperceptible if the watermarked content is perceptually equivalent to the original, unwatermarked content. In general, {{it is easy to}} create either robust watermarks—or—imperceptible watermarks, but the creation of both robust—and—imperceptible watermarks has proven to be quite challenging. Robust imperceptible watermarks have been proposed as a tool for the protection of digital content, for example as an embedded no-copy-allowed flag in professional video content.|$|E
25|$|A <b>digital</b> <b>watermark</b> {{is called}} {{perceptible}} if {{its presence in}} the marked signal is noticeable (e.g. Digital On-screen Graphics like a Network Logo, Content Bug, Codes, Opaque images). On videos and images, some are made transparent/translucent for convenience for consumers {{due to the fact}} that they block portion of the view; therefore degrading it.|$|E

We will be addressing the challenges posed to multimedia security management and how <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> can be deployed in different applications {{in order to meet}} those challenges. Categorization of <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> schemes according to the characteristics of the watermarks will be made. Applications, requirements, and limitations of different categories will be discussed.

40|$|In {{this paper}} are {{presented}} some results of implementation of <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> methods into image coding based on fractal principles. The paper focuses on two possible approaches of embedding <b>digital</b> <b>watermarks</b> into fractal code of images - embedding <b>digital</b> <b>watermarks</b> into parameters for position of similar blocks and coefficients of block similarity. Both algorithms were analyzed and verified on gray scale static images...|$|R
25|$|Reversible {{data hiding}} is a {{technique}} which enables images to be authenticated and then restored to their original form by removing the <b>digital</b> <b>watermark</b> and replacing the image data that had been overwritten. This would make the images acceptable for legal purposes. The US Army also is interested in this technique for authentication of reconnaissance images.|$|E
25|$|Then the {{watermarked}} {{digital signal}} is transmitted or stored, usually transmitted to another person. If this person makes a modification, {{this is called}} an attack. While the modification may not be malicious, the term attack arises from copyright protection application, where third parties may attempt to remove the <b>digital</b> <b>watermark</b> through modification. There are many possible modifications, for example, lossy compression of the data (in which resolution is diminished), cropping an image or video, or intentionally adding noise.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>digital</b> <b>watermark</b> {{is called}} [...] "fragile" [...] {{if it fails}} to be {{detectable}} after the slightest modification. Fragile watermarks are commonly used for tamper detection (integrity proof). Modifications to an original work that clearly are noticeable, commonly are not referred to as watermarks, but as generalized barcodes.|$|E

30|$|As an {{effective}} means of copyright protection, the <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> technology has attracted wide attention. Traditional <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> [1] can cause some distortion of the original image after embedding some information. But in some special applications, it is required to restore the original image; thus, the reversible <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> [2] emerges as the times require. Different from traditional <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> method, reversible watermarking technology can recover the original host information without distortion after extracting the watermark information, which is badly needed in the area of military intelligence, medical records, and legal argumentation demanding, so it has been widely developed in recent years.|$|R
25|$|Both {{steganography}} and <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> employ steganographic {{techniques to}} embed data covertly in noisy signals. While steganography aims for imperceptibility to human senses, <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> tries {{to control the}} robustness as top priority.|$|R
2500|$|Apple Inc. sold DRM {{content on}} their iTunes Store {{when it started}} 2003, but made music DRM-free after April 2007 and has been {{labeling}} all music as [...] "DRM-Free" [...] since January 2009. The music still carries a <b>digital</b> <b>watermark</b> to identify the purchaser. Other works sold on iTunes such as apps, audiobooks, movies, and TV shows continue to be protected by DRM.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>digital</b> <b>watermark</b> {{is a kind}} of marker covertly {{embedded}} in a noise-tolerant signal such as an audio, video or image data. It is typically used to identify ownership of the copyright of such signal. [...] "Watermarking" [...] is the process of hiding digital information in a carrier signal; the hidden information should, but does not need to, contain a relation to the carrier signal. Digital watermarks may be used to verify the authenticity or integrity of the carrier signal or to show the identity of its owners. It is prominently used for tracing copyright infringements and for banknote authentication.|$|E

30|$|The {{research}} on technologies of information hiding and <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> has developed for nearly twenty years. Information hiding {{is applied to}} covert communication, and <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> is applied to copyright protection. They share one feature in common: When some data are embedded into the carrier data, no obvious damage is caused. Therefore, the key point of information hiding and <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> is the same and that's what is called information hiding in a broad sense [1]. However, differences in their application environments result in different research emphases and requirements. Information hiding emphasizes on the resistance to steganalysis attacks while <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> stresses the perceptual invisibility.|$|R
40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> {{techniques}} {{have recently been}} proposed for the copyright protection of digital media. Time-stamping is one technique used to ascertain at what time a certain digital medium was created or signed. In this paper, a new time-stamping protocol for <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> is proposed that adds a time-stamp to <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> algorithms through a trusted third party. The goals of the proposed protocol are (1) the trusted third party {{is not required to}} store any messages relating to the signed time-stamp, (2) it is suitable for all <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> algorithms, and (3) it contains a time stamp that is impervious to forgery.
