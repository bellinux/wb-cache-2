5|$|In 1979 {{he began}} to {{experience}} hip and leg problems; one of his legs had shortened {{an inch and a}} half and he had to learn to walk again. Although he remained otherwise <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>health</b> this was a sign of his increasing age, and the disabilities that came with it began to affect his judgments as well. While speaking at Cumberland Lodge in 1980 he forgot the details of the case, something shocking for a judge noted for his excellent memory.|$|E

Delaying it is considered sinful unless the delay is caused by reasons beyond his/her control.|$|E

5|$|After the Indonesian film {{industry}} crashed in 1992 Umboh directed two television serials: Pahlawan Tak Dikenal (Unknown Hero; 1994) and Apsari.

In 1994 Suara Pembaharuan (now Suara Pembaruan), inaccurately reported him having died, a claim which Umboh publicly refuted. Umboh died at 4:45am WIB (UTC+7) on 24January 1996 in Jakarta of complications from diabetes and a stroke. He was buried in Jeruk Purut Cemetery, South Jakarta. Three weeks before his death, he was reportedly <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>health</b> and preparing to film a new serial entitled Gejolak Kampus Muda (Symptoms of a Youth Campus).|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters spend around 10% {{of their}} day on comfort activities. These include sunning themselves, dust bathing and water bathing. Sunning {{behaviour}} helps warm birds in the morning, reducing the need to use energy to raise their temperature. It also has a social aspect, as multiple birds adopt the same posture. Finally, it may help stimulate parasites in the feathers, making them easier to find and remove. Due to their hole-nesting lifestyle, bee-eaters accumulate a number of external parasites such as mites and flies. Together with sunning, bouts of dust bathing (or water bathing where available), as well as rigorous preening, keep the feathers and skin <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>health.</b> Bathing with water involves making shallow dives into a water body and then returning to a perch to preen.|$|E

His memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields and was widely attended, including by representatives of the Royal Family. His ashes were scattered over Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra. The Canberra suburb of Bruce, and the electoral Division of Bruce based in south-east Melbourne, were both named for him after his death.|$|E
