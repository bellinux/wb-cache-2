40|$|We {{observed}} {{high quality}} elastic light scattering from a silicon microsphere {{in the standard}} telecommunication band. A tunable diode laser {{was used as the}} excitation source and a single mode silica optical fiber setup delivered the input laser light to the microsphere. The silicon microsphere was manipulated on the silica optical fiber <b>half</b> <b>coupler</b> (OFHC) to effectively couple the evanescent laser field to the microsphere thus exciting the whispering gallery modes (WGM's). We observed high quality factor WGM's which can lead to novel geometries and applications for silicon microsphere based optoelectronic devices, such as filters, modulators, and detectors...|$|E
40|$|Dielectric microspheres, {{with their}} {{morphology}} dependent resonances, {{are used to}} resonantly couple light from <b>half</b> optical fiber <b>couplers.</b> The dropped channels are observed in the elastic scattering and the transmission spectra. The excitation of the microsphere with the nearly Gaussian beam in the <b>half</b> optical fiber <b>coupler</b> provides spatially and spectrally selective, and enhanced light coupling. The filter drops approximately 10 % (0. 5 dB) of the power at the resonance wavelength. A tunable single mode distributed feedback diode laser is used as the infrared excitation source. The generalized Lorenz-Mie theory, describing the illumination of the microsphere with a Gaussian beam, is used to interpret the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|A low-insertion-loss, all-single-mode fiber, wavelength-division-multiplexing filter {{comprising}} a four-port polished coupler and {{a strong}} fiber grating is demonstrated. The device operated in a novel way by a process we call grating-frustrated directional coupling. A fiber grating, present in only one <b>half</b> of the <b>coupler,</b> frustrates the transference of power to the other half within a narrow wavelength range. The performance of a prototype device - a 1535 -nm channel-dropping filter with 0. 7 -nm bandwidth, 70 % peak transmission, and 13 -dB isolation-shows great promise for wavelength-division-multiplexing and line-filtering applications...|$|R

40|$|Morphology-dependent {{resonances}} of microspheres {{can provide}} the necessary optical feedback for applications in spectroscopy, laser science, and optical communications. The elastic scattering of focused light from dielectric microspheres is understood by the localization principle and the generalized Lorenz-Mie theory. We excited the morphology-dependent resonances of glass microspheres by a tunable distributed-feedback laser and detected the elastically scattered signal. Efficient coupling to morphology-dependent resonances is achieved using an optical fiber <b>half</b> <b>coupler.</b> Resonance peaks in the elastic scattering spectra and associated dips in the transmission spectra are observed experimentally. Simulation results of elastic scattering spectra of glass microspheres in the C-band are presented. (C) 2004 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers...|$|E
40|$|A microcavity-based {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} (DNA) optical {{biosensor}} is demonstrated {{for the first}} time using synthetic sapphire for the optical cavity. Transmitted and elastic scattering intensity at 1510 nm are analyzed from a sapphire microsphere (radius 500 mu m, refractive index 1. 77) on an optical fiber <b>half</b> <b>coupler.</b> The 0. 43 nm angular mode spacing of the resonances correlates well with the optical size of the sapphire sphere. Probe DNA consisting of a 36 -mer fragment was covalently immobilized on a sapphire microsphere and hybridized with a 29 -mer target DNA. Whispering gallery modes (WGMs) were monitored before the sapphire was functionalized with DNA and after it was functionalized with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The shift in WGMs from the surface modification with DNA was measured and correlated well with the estimated thickness of the add-on DNA layer. It is shown that ssDNA is more uniformly oriented on the sapphire surface than dsDNA. In addition, it is shown that functionalization of the sapphire spherical surface with DNA does not affect the quality factor (Q approximate to 10 (4)) of the sapphire microspheres. The use of sapphire is especially interesting because this material is chemically resilient, biocompatible, and widely used for medical implants.

40|$|Abstract ： We {{designed}} a new module of Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) with {{fiber optical system}}, which is mainly comprised of a laser diode, optical fibers and a two dimensional (2 D) photodetector. The fiber optical system involved a laser diode (VCSEL, Copax Inc.) with 850 nm wavelength, single mode fiber (Prime Optical Fiber Inc.), <b>half</b> <b>coupler</b> and two fiber collimators. The 2 D photodetector made by silicon PIN photodiode is aligned between the two collimators with 39 ° beams cross angle and all the components were set into a rectangle case, which have coin’s size and can be accommodated by two same set of these components. We added anticoagulant and antiseptic into fresh chicken blood and diluted it with normal saline, and then put the diluted blood into a beaker with a motor in the liquid. The diluted blood was pumped by the motor into an aqueduct which is connected to glass aqueduct, {{and back to the}} beaker to form a circulation system. In the experiments, we evaluate the relationships among the blood cell velocity and diameter of glass tube, temperature variation of blood, and concentrations of blood. By analyzing the results of these experiments, the main factor that affects the precision of velocity measurement is the cross angle of two injected laser beams and the intensity of scattering light. The module constructed by optical fiber light can precisely measure the velocity of blood flow at most 5 % error...|$|E
40|$|Circular {{cavities}} [1] such as microspheres [2], microdisks [3], and microtoroids [4] {{with high}} quality factor whispering gallery modes (WGMs) continue {{to open up}} new perspectives in sensing [5 - 8]. Here, we report an optical setup for a DNA optical biosensor based on sapphire microsphere. The transmitted and elastic scattering intensity at 1510 nm were analyzed from a sapphire microsphere on an optical fiber <b>half</b> <b>coupler.</b> The 0. 43 nm angular mode spacing of the WGMs correlated well with the optical size of the sapphire microsphere. The spectral linewidths of the WGMs were {{on the order of}} 0. 01 nm, which corresponded to quality factors on the order of 104. Afterwards, the sapphire microsphere was modified with DNA and an optical biosensor is demonstrated using an insulating implant material such as sapphire. A probe DNA, consisting of a 36 -mer fragment was covalently immobilized on sapphire microsphere and hybridized with a 29 -mer target DNA. WGMs were monitored prior to the sapphire’s functionalization with DNA and after the sapphire was functionalized with single stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double stranded DNA (dsDNA). Fig. 1 90 ° elastic scattering spectra from sapphire sphere modified with (a) ssDNA and (b) modified with dsDNA showing the corresponding shift for (A) non-modified sphere and (B) sphere modified with DNA.
