5000|$|Ernest Oliver Gidden, [...] (15 March 1910 - 20 December 1961), {{known as}} Mick Gidden, {{was awarded the}} George Cross for the [...] "great gallantry and undaunted devotion to duty" [...] he showed while <b>defusing</b> <b>mines</b> and bombs during the Blitz in London. He served at [...] with the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve and was cited for making safe a mine that had fallen on Hungerford Bridge on 17 April 1941.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} [...] "minigames" [...] based on real tasks {{undertaken}} in the field. Touchscreen-based minigames place the player in charge of <b>defusing</b> <b>mines,</b> sending Morse code radio messages, and bandaging wounded allies, as well as rotating wheels to aim mortar and artillery weapons. The player mans additional emplacements including machine-gun turrets and anti-aircraft guns. There is a parachuting segment of one mission. There are also tank levels in which player controls the tank's turret and machine-gun.|$|R
2500|$|Completing {{his basic}} {{training}}, Goldsworthy {{volunteered for the}} Rendering Mines Safe Section on [...] He quickly proved himself as a skilled officer {{who was able to}} use his pre-war training in electricity and physics to great effect. He was often required to <b>defuse</b> <b>mines</b> underwater wearing a bulky diving suit that made the slow, steady movements required in this work very difficult. During this period, he was tasked with disposing of German acoustic mines in a number of British harbours.|$|R
5000|$|Lt. Richard Houston (Richard Arlen) is {{an officer}} in the U.S. Navy who deserted during peacetime service to escape {{gambling}} debts, and took up life as a hobo. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor spurs him to rejoin the Navy under the assumed name of Jim [...] "Tennessee" [...] Smith. Houston is assigned to serve aboard a minesweeper, where he carries out numerous successful efforts to <b>defuse</b> <b>mines</b> in the San Diego harbor while struggling to keep his identity secret.|$|R

50|$|His early service {{included}} mine disposal. In December 1940, having previously <b>defused</b> 16 <b>mines,</b> a mine {{fell on the}} fire-float Firefly in the Manchester Ship Canal, landing {{inside the}} deck locker alongside the engine-room. It failed to explode.|$|R
50|$|Gidden {{was awarded}} the George Medal for <b>defusing</b> a <b>mine</b> which had fallen between two houses in Harlesden {{in the late summer}} of 1940. The notice for this award {{appeared}} in the London Gazette of 14 January 1941.|$|R
50|$|John Ainsworth Davis/Christopher Creighton in his thinly {{disguised}} 1987 fictional account The Krushchev Objective with co-author Noel Hynd, states he was {{the second}} diver with Crabb that thwarted an assassination attempt on the Soviet dictator by <b>defusing</b> limpet <b>mines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|He {{received}} a commission {{as a temporary}} electrical sub-lieutenant, and after training took command of an armed mine trawler, HMS Prospects Ahead. Bailey subsequently undertook mine sweeping patrols in the North Sea. In September 1941 he was trained as a helmeted diver and deployed to Gibraltar as Senior Diving Officer.

On 29 December 1942 {{he was awarded the}} George Medal for [...] "gallantry and undaunted devotion to duty" [...] while <b>defusing</b> shipping <b>mines</b> in the western Mediterranean.|$|R
25|$|He then {{engaged in}} a series of {{recoveries}} between 12 June 1943 and 10 April 1944, during which time he defused four German ground mines, three magnetic mines and one acoustic mine. During the defusal of the acoustic mine, which had lain in the water off Milford Haven Wales {{for two and a half}} years, Goldsworthy struck his head on the foot of a ladder while underwater and injured his back while trying to get clear. He, nonetheless, had still managed to extract the fuse and primer.

50|$|Military diving {{covers all}} types of diving carried out by {{military}} personnel. There {{are a number of}} different specialisations for a military diver to choose; some depend on which branch of the military they have joined or where the military needs more divers. Typical offensive activities include underwater demolition, infiltration and sabotage, this being the type of work elite regiments such as the UK Special Boat Service or the USA Navy SEALs carry out. Defensive activities are centered around countering the threat of enemy special forces and enemy anti-shipping measures, and typically involve <b>defusing</b> <b>mines,</b> searching for explosive devices attached to the hulls of ships, and locating enemy frogmen in the water.|$|R
50|$|Players {{use their}} {{resources}} to construct buildings and units. Because both factions {{have access to}} the same units, or infantry and vehicles, advantage lies at how theyre used. Some buildings assemble vehicles and produce soldiers and others provide defense. Production buildings can be upgraded to produce better units. Infantry troops are cheap to produce but are not as tough, while vehicles tend to be costly. Vehicles range from dump trucks and base-building bulldozers to helicopters, tanks and half-tracks to Dum-dums, suicidal robots armed with firecrackers. Aside from grunts and grenadiers, infantry units have a special tasks: Minesweepers <b>defuse</b> <b>mines,</b> snipers are deadly from distance and mortar men, especially three or more, rain ruination on buildings in short order.|$|R
50|$|The film {{follows the}} {{trajectory}} of some men of landmine clearance unit from the Brazilian Expeditionary Force, who after a panic attack {{are trying to get}} tempers and <b>defuse</b> the <b>mined</b> road that separates them from a village monitored by enemy forces.|$|R

5|$|By 9March1968, the U.S. {{facility}} {{on top of}} Phou Pha Thi was surrounded by North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao units. The VPA 766th Regiment and one Pathet Lao battalion totalled more than 3,000 men. Despite {{the gravity of the}} situation, Sullivan did not issue an order for the evacuation of U.S. personnel from Phou Pha Thi. At around 18:00 on 10March, Lima Site 85 was subjected to a series of artillery barrages. Under the cover of the artillery bombardment, the North Vietnamese Special Forces sent a small team up the mountain to <b>defuse</b> <b>mines</b> and quick-fuse grenades, and to establish their routes of infiltration. Inside the facility, U.S. technicians immediately grabbed their weapons and ran into trenches and bunkers, thereby abandoning the very equipment which could enable them to call for air support. At 19:45 the barrage stopped, and the U.S. technicians returned to their positions.|$|R
50|$|STANAVFORCHAN {{continuously}} trained {{mine clearance}} and allied cooperation {{to ensure that}} in case of war the four allied nations {{would be able to}} <b>defuse</b> Soviet <b>mines</b> dropped by airplane or submarine in their area of operations rapidly. In 2000 STANAVFORCHAN changed name and composition when the Royal Danish Navy and Royal Norwegian Navy joined the squadron. Today the unit is named Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group 1.|$|R

5000|$|Land of Mine {{received}} critical acclaim. Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes {{gives the}} film a 89% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] rating, {{with an average}} score of 7.4/10, based on reviews from 56 critics. The consensus states: [...] "Land of Mine uses an oft-forgotten chapter from the aftermath of World War II to tell a hard-hitting story whose period setting belies its timeless observations about bloodshed and forgiveness." [...] It gained a standing ovation at the Toronto Film Festival, with Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter stating [...] "Director Martin Zandvliet {{has come up with}} a fresh and compelling approach to this well-traveled territory" [...] and David D'Arcy of the Screendaily stating [...] "Land of Mine achieves moments of chilling suspense in scenes of untrained soldiers <b>defusing</b> <b>mines</b> by hand and in the bloody bodies that leap into the air when the boys fail". Domestically it received 5 out of 6 stars from a number of critics, who all stated it was the best Danish film of the year. It was selected to play at Sundance in 2016.|$|R
50|$|Also in Libya, Type 84 mines {{were also}} found in the coastal town of Dafniya by DanChurchAid (DCA) and in the city of Sirte by the Swiss Foundation for Mine Action (FSD). In November 2011, two DCA staff were injured while trying to <b>defuse</b> a <b>mine</b> in Dafniya and had to be hospitalised. In March 2012, a DCA {{international}} deminer was killed by another mine while clearing buildings of explosives in Dafniya.|$|R
50|$|As a RNVR sub-lieutenant, he {{had been}} trained in naval {{ordnance}} disposal. The Luftwaffe had started dropping parachute adapted naval mines, with variable fusing. Naval disposal teams were detailed to deal with these. Easton, with his assistant Bennett Southwell attempted to <b>defuse</b> a <b>mine</b> suspended inside a damaged house. When the fusing engaged, the two men evacuated the house, but were caught by the explosion. Easton was seriously wounded, and Southwell killed, both being later awarded the George Cross.|$|R
2500|$|Call of Duty: World at War was {{released}} for the Nintendo DS on November 11, 2008 in North America, and on November 14 in Europe.

Up to four players can be supported online with four different types of game, as well as perks and rank-ups. Compared to Modern Warfare, it has improved in-level geometry, has more responsive sprints and crouches and 3D-modeled guns instead of 2D sprites. However the flamethrower, which is new to the game series, is rendered with 2D sprites. The framerate is just under 30 and has lots of voice-over during the missions. Players are able to <b>defuse</b> <b>mines</b> and send Morse code with the touch screen, as well as using mortar rounds, an anti-air gun from a battleship, parachuting and using mounted guns. There is also a tank mode which allows the player to turn the main gun and fire machine gun rounds at the same time.|$|R

50|$|On 31 January 1941, {{a mobile}} column of 3/12 Royal Frontier Force Rifles, {{including}} a detachment of 21 Field Company under Second Lieutenant Bhagat, was sent on a reconnaissance mission towards Metemma. Bhagat's Bren carrier {{passed through a}} heavily mined stretch of road and detonated two mines, the second of which destroyed the carrier and killed the driver and a sapper. Bhagat then continued in another carrier, <b>defusing</b> <b>mines</b> by hand as the column moved down the road. Under close enemy fire and without food or rest, he worked for four days, clearing a total of 15 minefields over a distance of 55 miles. After having another Bren carrier blown up under him on 2 February, which resulted in punctured eardrums, he was relieved of further duties and evacuated to Khartoum for treatment. He was decorated with the Victoria Cross later that month, presented with the ribbon by General Wavell (later Field Marshal the Earl Wavell), the Commander-in-Chief, India in June at Asmara, and formally invested with the decoration by the Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, at Viceroy's House in Delhi on 10 November.|$|R

50|$|The pair had {{to climb}} through {{a window into the}} bedroom, as the mine was {{blocking}} the door wedged between a bedstead and the collapsing chimney. Easton set about <b>defusing</b> the <b>mine</b> with Southwell passing him tools through the window. They were working in this way {{when the rest of the}} chimney collapsed, setting off the fuse which began to tick. They ran for cover in a nearby air raid shelter but the mine exploded, destroying six surrounding streets and killing Southwell instantly.|$|R
50|$|Many mines {{combine the}} main trigger {{with a touch}} or tilt trigger to prevent enemy {{engineers}} from <b>defusing</b> it. Land <b>mine</b> designs tend to use as little metal as possible to make searching with a metal detector more difficult; land mines made mostly of plastic have the added advantage of being very inexpensive.|$|R
