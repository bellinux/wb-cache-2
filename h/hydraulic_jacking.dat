40|$|Abstract- An inbuilt <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jack</b> {{system is}} {{attached}} to automobile vehicle on front and rear par of the chassis. An automobile <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jack</b> system can be easily attached to all currently manufacture automobile chassis and frames. There is a front suspension <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jack</b> that is mounted centrally to the front suspension of an automobile between its front wheels. There is also a rear suspension <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jack</b> that is mounted centrally to the rear suspension of the automobile between its rear wheels. The system operates from a compressed fluid reservoir tank that has connections for {{the front and rear}} car jack outlets. Additional outlets can be added to the compressed fluid reservoir tank for connecting a hydraulic lug wrench and another for a tire inflating hose. The Major Project entitled “Inbuilt <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jack</b> in automobile vehicle ” Worked on the principal of hydraulic power and operated by 12 Volt DC current, solves the all major problem of maintenance of all automobiles specially the heavy vehicles like truck and bus. This work, if implemented, would definitely help in the maintenance of automobiles and also in saving of time. I...|$|R
50|$|Following on from {{previous}} designs of London taxi, the FX3 had a traditional 3-door body, {{with an open}} luggage platform rather than a front passenger seat beside the driver. The FX3 was fitted with mechanical brakes, with rod operation, beam axles on leaf springs and a built-in Jackall <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> system. Like all London taxis, it has a tight turning circle of 25 ft (7.6m) diameter, {{as required by the}} Conditions of Fitness.|$|E
50|$|A new {{designed}} chassis {{with straight}} box section sidemembers having six tubular cross-members is particularly stiff so the {{independent front suspension}} can work properly. Steering is carried out by worm and nut. Automatic chassis lubrication {{is controlled by the}} clutch pedal. The car is fitted with a Smiths <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> system. The independent front suspension to Alviss own design is by transverse leaf springs. The semi-elliptic rear springs are underslung. Luvax hydraulic shock absorbers control the springing. A fully floating rear axle is fitted. Wire wheels with bolt-on hubs are supplied fitted with extra low-pressure tyres. Four-wheel, self-energising Girling brakes have large diameter drums which are ribbed for cooling.|$|E
50|$|The KLG Sparking Plug {{distribution}} {{rights were}} purchased from Kenelm Lee Guinness in 1919. The British Jaeger Instrument Company was purchased in 1927 {{as was the}} KLG Sparking Plug Company (Robinhood Engineering). The Jackall <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> system was manufactured from 1935 by Smith's Jacking Systems and immediately became standard equipment in many popular cars. In 1937 a separate aircraft and marine department {{was created in the}} parent company and named Smiths Aircraft Instruments. It operated with Smiths subsidiary Henry Hughes and Son manufacturers of aircraft and marine instruments. In 1946, Smiths and the Ingersoll Watch Company founded the Anglo-Celtic Watch Co. Ltd., which produced watches in Wales. This became one of the largest producers of watches in Europe before closing in 1980.|$|E

50|$|Two {{options were}} {{initially}} considered for moving the structure: <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacks</b> {{to push the}} structure forward, or pulling the structure with large, multi-stranded steel cables. The first option would require the relocation of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacks</b> after each push. This relocation process would necessitate more worker interaction with the system and a greater worker exposure to radiation. The second option was initially chosen because it would expose workers to a lower radiation dose, and would have moved the structure into its final position in less than 24 hours. However, the structure was moved using <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacks</b> making the 327-meter move starting on 14 November 2016 and ending on 29 November.|$|R

5000|$|Whilst it used a {{brand new}} 4-cylinder 2199 cc, overhead-valve engine—the first {{to be used in}} an Austin car, it in fact used the chassis and body of the pre-war Austin 12, which {{continued}} to be produced, alongside the other pre-war saloons the 8 hp and the 10 hp. The number Sixteen was not an indication of the actual power output of the engine but rather the result of a calculation used to determine the excise duty (road tax) payable for the vehicle. The engine in fact produced [...] at 3800 rpm. The car shared a number of features with the famed London Taxi, one of which was the built-in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> system operated from a pump located under the bonnet.|$|E
50|$|The Wraith {{featured}} {{an independent}} coil sprung front suspension {{based on a}} Packard 120 retaining semi elliptical leaf springs on the rear axle. The hydraulic dampers at the front had their damping rate controlled by governor and so varied {{with the speed of}} the car, making it superior to its predecessor, the 25/30 H.P. and on par with the Phantom III. The car was still built on a separate chassis but this was now of welded rather than the traditional riveted construction. The drum brakes were assisted by a mechanical servo driven by the engine patented by Hispano-Suiza and built by Rolls-Royce under licence. Wire wheels of 17 inch diameter were fitted, with the spokes usually covered by removable discs. A built in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> system was fitted operated by a lever under the passenger seat.|$|E
50|$|The K 12 (E) {{was mounted}} on a simple box-girder carriage, which was carried on two {{subframes}} which were in turn mounted on double bogies. The barrel was mounted in a ring cradle with a hydropneumatic recoil system. Two more hydropneumatic systems were connected to the subframes, which allowed the entire carriage to recoil some 98 cm. For transport the gun itself was disconnected from its recoil system and drawn back some 1.5 m to reduce the mounting's overall length {{and allow it to}} fit in the normal railroad loading gauge. The barrel's extreme length required external bracing to prevent it from bending under its own weight. Its trunnions were placed as far forward as possible to balance the barrel and minimize the force necessary to elevate it. This placed the breech perilously close to the ground and a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> system was built in each subframe to elevate the mount 1 m. However it was impossible to load the weapon in this position and it had to be lowered between every shot.|$|E
50|$|Screw jacks {{have now}} largely been {{replaced}} by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacks.</b> This was encouraged in 1858 when jacks by the Tangye company to Bramah's hydraulic press concept were applied to the successful launching of Brunel's , after two failed attempts by other means. The maximum mechanical advantage possible for a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jack</b> is not limited by the limitations on screw jacks and can be far greater. After World War II, improvements to the grinding of hydraulic rams {{and the use of}} O ring seals reduced the price of low-cost <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacks</b> and they became widespread for use with domestic cars. Screw jacks still remain for minimal cost applications, such as the little-used tyre-changing jacks supplied with cars.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>jacks</b> are {{typically}} used for shop work, {{rather than as}} an emergency jack to be carried with the vehicle. Use of jacks not designed for a specific vehicle requires more than the usual care in selecting ground conditions, the jacking point on a vehicle, and to ensure stability when the <b>jack</b> is extended. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>jacks</b> are often used to lift elevators in low and medium rise buildings.|$|R
50|$|An air <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jack</b> is a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jack</b> that is {{actuated}} by compressed air - for example, air from a compressor - instead of human work. This {{eliminates the need}} for the user to actuate the hydraulic mechanism, saving effort and potentially increasing speed. Sometimes, such jacks are also able to be operated by the normal hydraulic actuation method, thereby retaining functionality, even if a source of compressed air is not available.|$|R
50|$|Conventional tugs use a tow bar {{to connect}} the tug to the nose landing gear of the aircraft. The tow bar is fixed {{laterally}} at the nose landing gear, but may move slightly vertically for height adjustment. At the end that attaches to the tug, the tow bar may pivot freely laterally and vertically. In this manner the tow bar acts as a large lever to rotate the nose landing gear. Each aircraft type has a unique tow fitting so the towbar also acts as an adapter between the standard-sized tow pin on the tug and the type-specific fitting on the aircraft's landing gear. The tow bar must be long enough to place the tug far away enough to avoid hitting the aircraft and to provide sufficient leverage to facilitate turns. On heavy tow bars for large aircraft the towbar rides on its own wheels when not connected to an aircraft. The wheels are attached to a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> mechanism which can lift the towbar to the correct height to mate to both the airplane and the tug, and once this is accomplished the same mechanism is used in reverse to raise the tow bar wheels from the ground during the pushback process. The tow bar can be connected at the front or {{the rear of the}} tractor, depending on whether the aircraft will be pushed or pulled. The towbar has a shear pin which prevents the aircraft from being mishandled by the tug; when overstressed the shear pin will snap, disconnecting the bar from the nose gear to prevent damage to the aircraft and tug.Towbarless tractors do not use a towbar; they scoop up the nose landing gear and lift it off the ground, allowing the tug to maneuver the aircraft. This allows better control of the aircraft and higher speeds; it may also eliminate the need to have a worker in the cockpit to apply the aircraft's brakes. The main advantage of a towbarless tug is simplicity; {{there is no need to}} maintain multiple towbars. The physical action and coordination required by the tug operator to move an aircraft with a TBL tug is simpler and easier to learn than with a tug and towbar. By connecting the tug directly to the aircraft's landing gear tug operators have better control and responsiveness when maneuvering. This is most advantageous in general aviation settings where operators are often required to move more types of aircraft more often into more confined spaces than their airline counterparts.|$|E
40|$|Pretensioned {{high-strength}} concrete (PHC) pipe piles {{have been}} widely used for geotechnical engineering such as foundation engineering, slope engineering, highway engineering. To study the performance of a PHC pipe pile under <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking,</b> the monitoring of the strain profile along the PHC pipe pile under <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> was carried out using FBG sensing technology. In this study, a PHC pipe pile was instrumented with two series of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors along pile axial direction and was then installed in the field using a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> method. To monitor the variation of strains along a PHC pile, two series of eight FBG strain sensors with different peak wavelengths were mounted {{on opposite sides of the}} pile with one meter spacing. In addition, based on the pile theory, both the axial force of the pile and average shear stress on the pile surface are calculated using the measured axial strains. It is found that there were significant residual strains in the piles after installation when hydraulic force was removed. This study confirms that the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors are suitable for monitoring strain distribution along a pile under <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking.</b> Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> is a {{significant}} dilation of a fracture that occurs when the pore pressure within it exceeds {{the sum of the}} fracture's normal stress and tensile strength. This phenomenon may occur during a glacial period because of changes in hydraulic and mechanical boundary conditions. Since <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> may alter flow patterns and the transport capacity of the rock mass, its possible effects on the long-term performance of a nuclear waste repository should be considered. We develop an approach to assess glacially induced <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> in fractured crystalline rock and establish bounding estimates of the maximum jacking depth for the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company's (SKB) repository site at Forsmark. The pore pressure is estimated using mechanically uncoupled two-dimensional poroelastic continuum models with hydraulic and mechanical conditions based on SKB's reconstruction of the Weichselian glaciation at this site (120 - 0 kaB. P.). For warm-based conditions, the water pressure at the ice/bed interface is set at 98 % of the mechanical load, whereas for glacial conditions with extensive proglacial permafrost, the corresponding water pressure is set at a (lower) annual average value. We demonstrate that the pore pressure within the uppermost kilometer of rock is mainly governed by the water pressure at the ice/bed interface and that the mechanical impact of the ice load on the pore pressure is sufficiently small to be ignored. Given the current and estimated future stress conditions at Forsmark, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> is mainly of concern for subhorizontal fractures, i. e., it is sufficient to consider situations when the pore pressure exceeds the vertical stress. We conclude that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> at Forsmark will be confined to the uppermost 200 m of the rock mass...|$|E

40|$|Many {{of the key}} {{processes}} governing fast glacier flow involve {{interaction between}} a glacier and its basal hydrological system, which is hidden from direct observation. Passive seismic monitoring has shown promise {{as a tool for}} remotely monitoring basal processes, but lack of glacier-bed access prevents clear understanding of the relationships between subglacial processes and corresponding seismic emissions. Here we describe direct measurements of basal hydrology, sliding, and broadband seismicity made in a unique subglacial facility in Norway during the onset of two summer melt seasons. In the most pronounced of these episodes, rapid delivery of surface meltwater to the bed briefly enhanced basal slip following a period of elevated high-frequency seismic activity related to surface crevassing. Subsequent ground tilt derived from ultralong-period seismic signals was associated with subglacial bedrock deformation during transient pressurization of the basal hydraulic system. These signals are interpreted to represent <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> as the supply of water to the bed exceeded the capacity of the hydraulic system. Enhanced slip terminated 2. 5 h after it started, when ice-bed decoupling or increased connectivity in the basal cavity network relieved cavity overpressure. The results support theoretical models for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> and illustrate how melt-induced increases in speed can be short lived if cavity growth or ice-bed decoupling allows basal water more efficient drainage...|$|E
40|$|The Crawler Transporter (CT), {{designed}} and built for the Apollo Program in the 1960 's and surpassing its initial operational life, has {{become an integral part}} of the Space Shuttle Program (SSP). The CT transports the Space Shuttle Vehicle (SSV) stack, atop the Mobile Launch Platform (MLP), from the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to the launch pad. This support structure provides <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking,</b> leveling and load equalization for the 12 million pound stack on its 3. 5 - 5. 0 mile rollout to the launch pad. Major elements of the SSV, consisting of the orbiter, solid rocket boosters (SRB) and external tank (ET) have required fatigue analyses as part of the mission life certification. Compared to rollout vibration, the SSV sees relatively high vibration loads during launch, ascent, descent and landing phases of the mission. Although preliminary measured SRB vibration levels during rollout were of low amplitude and frequency, the duration of the rollout phase is typically high, from 5 - 6 hours. As part of an expanded mission life assessment, additional certification effort was initiated to define fatigue load spectra for rollout. This study addresses the CT vibration analyses in support of the rollout fatigue study. Structural models developed for modal and vibration analyses were used to identify unique CT, CT/MLP and CT/MLP/SRB vibration characteristics for comparison to instrumented rollout tests. Whereas the main structural and vibration characteristics of the SSV are well defined, minimum analytical and vibration test data on the Crawler Transporter were available. Unique vibration characteristics of the CT are attributable to the drive mechanism, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> system, structural framing and the CT-to-MLP support pad restraints. Initial tests performed on the CT/MLP/SRB configuration showed reasonable correlation with predicted mode shapes and frequencies...|$|E

40|$|This {{study shows}} how a new {{generation}} of terrestrial laser scanners can be used to investigate glacier surface ablation and other elements of glacial hydrodynamics at exceptionally high spatial and temporal resolution. The study area is an Alpine valley glacier, Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland. Here we use an ultra-long-range lidar RIEGL VZ- 6000 scanner, having a laser specifically designed for measurement of snow- and ice-cover surfaces. We focus on two timescales: seasonal and daily. Our results show that a near-infrared scanning laser system can provide high-precision elevation change and ablation data from long ranges, and over relatively large sections of the glacier surface. We use it to quantify spatial variations in the patterns of surface melt at the seasonal scale, as controlled by both aspect and differential debris cover. At the daily scale, we quantify the effects of ogive-related differences in ice surface debris content on spatial patterns of ablation. Daily scale measurements point to possible <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> of the glacier associated with short-term water pressure rises. This latter demonstration shows that this type of lidar may be used to address subglacial hydrologic questions, in addition to motion and ablation measurements...|$|E
