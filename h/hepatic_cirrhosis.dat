25|$|Common {{side effects}} (>1% incidence) may include {{indigestion}} and eczema. Rare side effects include joint pain, memory loss, and muscle cramps. Cholestatic hepatitis, <b>hepatic</b> <b>cirrhosis,</b> rhabdomyolysis (destruction of muscles and blockade of renal system), and myositis {{have been reported}} in patients receiving the drug chronically. Serious allergic reactions to simvastatin are rare. If the following signs of a serious allergic reaction occur, seek medical attention immediately: rash, hoarsness itching/swelling, dizziness, or difficulty swallowing/breathing.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone is used {{primarily}} to treat heart failure, edematous {{conditions such as}} nephrotic syndrome or ascites in people with liver disease, essential hypertension, hypokalemia, secondary hyperaldosteronism (such as occurs with <b>hepatic</b> <b>cirrhosis),</b> and Conn's syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism). On its own, spironolactone is only a weak diuretic because it primarily targets the distal nephron (collecting tubule), where only small amounts of sodium are reabsorbed, {{but it can be}} combined with other diuretics to increase efficacy.|$|E

500|$|The disease {{bears the}} name of the British {{physician}} Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson (1878–1937), a neurologist who described the condition, including the pathological changes in the brain and liver, in 1912. Wilson's work had been predated by, and drew on, reports from German neurologist Carl Westphal (in 1883), who termed it [...] "pseudosclerosis"; by the British neurologist William Gowers (in 1888); and by Adolph Strümpell (in 1898), who noted <b>hepatic</b> <b>cirrhosis.</b> Neuropathologist John Nathaniel Cumings made the link with copper accumulation in both the liver and the brain in 1948.

40|$|Background and Aim Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that coffee consumption may be inversely correlated with <b>hepatic</b> fibrosis and <b>cirrhosis.</b> However, the reported results have been inconsistent. To summarize previous evidences quantitatively, a meta-analysis was performed. Methods The Medline, Web of Science, and Embase databases (from inception to June 2015) were searched to identify relevant trials that evaluated the effects of coffee consumption on <b>hepatic</b> fibrosis or <b>cirrhosis.</b> Odds ratios (ORs) of advanced <b>hepatic</b> fibrosis or <b>cirrhosis</b> for low or moderate, high, and any coffee consumption versus no consumption were pooled. Two cups per day was used as the cut-off level between low or moderate and high consumption. Results Sixteen studies were included, involving 3034 coffee consumers and 132076 people who do not consume coffee. The pooled results of the meta-analysis indicated that coffe...|$|R

50|$|In 2005, {{he and his}} {{postdoctoral}} fellow, Rodrigo Calado, {{described for}} the first time in humans mutations in the telomerase gene, TERT, residing among patients with aplastic anemia. This work demonstrated an inherited pattern for apparently acquired aplastic anemia and indicated that deficiency in telomerase genes cause telomere shortening, reduced hematopoietic stem cell function, and bone marrow failure. He later found that telomerase mutations also are a risk factor for acute myeloid leukemia and <b>hepatic</b> liver <b>cirrhosis.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hereditary {{haemochromatosis}} {{is characterized}} by an accelerated rate of intestinal iron absorption and progressive iron deposition in various tissues. This typically begins to be expressed in the third to fifth decades of life, but may occur in children. The most common presentation is <b>hepatic</b> (liver) <b>cirrhosis</b> in combination with hypopituitarism, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, arthritis, or hyperpigmentation. Because of the severe sequelae of this disorder if left untreated, and recognizing that treatment is relatively simple, early diagnosis before symptoms or signs appear is important.|$|R
50|$|Aagenaes {{syndrome}} is a syndrome characterised by congenital hypoplasia of lymph vessels, which causes lymphedema {{of the legs}} and recurrent cholestasis in infancy, and slow progress to <b>hepatic</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> and giant cell hepatitis with fibrosis of the portal tracts.|$|E
5000|$|Senter {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} [...] "Desmons' syndrome") is a cutaneous condition characterized by similar skin changes and congenital hearing impairment to keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome, but {{is associated with}} glycogen storage leading to hepatomegaly, <b>hepatic</b> <b>cirrhosis,</b> growth failure and mental retardation.|$|E

30|$|Excessive {{consumption}} of alcohol causes liver damage via different mechanisms including oxidative stress, hypoxia, upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and metabolic effects involving various liver cell types. Activated Kupffer cells release a variety of potentially damaging substances including cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that negatively affect hepatocytes and {{may lead to the}} activation of hepatic stellate cells [60, 61]. The response in hepatocytes includes mitochondrial damage (increase of mitochondrial AST), relative hepatic ATP depletion and altered nitric oxide (NO)-dependent control of respiration. An acceleration and propagation of these processes leads to increased <b>hepatic</b> inflammation, <b>cirrhosis</b> and HCC.|$|R
40|$|The liver is {{an organ}} {{consisting}} of the largest reticulo-endothelial cell network {{in the body and}} playing an important role in host defense against invading microorganisms. The organ is comprised of parenchymal cells and many different types of non-parenchymal cells, all of which play a significant role. Even biliary epithelial cells are not only the target in autoimmune liver diseases but also have central role in orchestrating several immune cells involved in both innate and acquired immunity. Tissue damage caused by various agents results in inflammation, necrosis, fibrosis, and, eventually, distortion of normal <b>hepatic</b> architecture, <b>cirrhosis,</b> and functional deterioration...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundStaged palliative {{surgical}} procedures {{have been an}} effective treatment of complex congenital heart defects. The Fontan procedure has been of particular benefit to infants with functional single-ventricle complexes but with the consequence of a sustained increase of right-sided venous pressure. MethodsWe reviewed the clinical and pathologic features of 9 autopsied patients having undergone the Fontan procedure, with special attention given to their liver pathology. ResultsThe 9 patients died from {{a few hours to}} 18 years after the Fontan operation. Chronic passive congestion was seen in 7 patients, and 4 patients surviving 4 to 18 years also had cardiac <b>cirrhosis.</b> <b>Hepatic</b> adenoma in the setting of cardiac cirrhosis was found in a patient surviving for 9 years. One patient surviving for 18 years had hepatocellular carcinoma superimposed on cardiac cirrhosis. Rupture of the hepatoma in this case led to fatal hemorrhage. ConclusionThe study shows that chronically increased hepatic venous pressure from the Fontan procedure might lead to chronic passive congestion, cardiac <b>cirrhosis,</b> <b>hepatic</b> adenoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma...|$|R
