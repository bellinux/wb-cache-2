25|$|I {{want to ask}} {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, {{that many of our}} dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult. I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be <b>happy.</b> <b>You</b> deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E
500|$|There are {{two types}} of costumed shows used by Chuck E. Cheese's: the LIVE! show and the Road show. The LIVE! show is {{performed}} {{at the front of the}} stage in the showroom, whenever a child is celebrating a birthday. The live show is a way of pumping up the crowd before a customized rendition of [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] is sung to the child that is celebrating the birthday ("I say <b>Happy,</b> <b>you</b> say Birthday..."). A costumed Chuck E. Cheese dances with the guests and sings, while being accompanied by the cast members. The Road show is a performance by a costumed Chuck E. Cheese character, and is performed outside the normal showroom. Children are gathered via the public announcement system or by Chuck E. Cheese himself. Chuck E. Cheese wants the kids to dance in order to win free tickets. The free tickets are thrown at the end of the performance for all the kids that participated. Chuck E. comes out every hour on the half hour (12:30, 1:30, etc.). The songs Chuck E. and the kids dance to are usually well-known classic songs such as [...] "If You're Happy and You Know It" [...] and [...] "Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes".|$|E
500|$|Because rehearsals did {{not start}} until October 1874 and lasted longer than anticipated, the premiere was delayed. The final rehearsals went well, and in a {{generally}} optimistic mood the first night was fixed for 3 March 1875, the day on which, coincidentally, Bizet's appointment as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour was formally announced. The premiere, which was conducted by Adolphe Deloffre, was attended by many of Paris's leading musical figures, including Massenet, Offenbach, Delibes and Gounod; during the performance the last-named was overheard complaining bitterly that Bizet had stolen the music of Micaëla's act 3 aria from him: [...] "That melody is mine!" [...] Halévy recorded his impressions of the premiere {{in a letter to}} a friend; the first act was evidently well received, with applause for the main numbers and numerous curtain calls. The first part of act 2 also went well, but after the toreador's song there was, Halévy noted, [...] "coldness". In act 3 only Micaëla's aria earned applause as the audience became increasingly disconcerted. The final act was [...] "glacial from first to last", and Bizet was left [...] "only with the consolations of a few friends". The critic Ernest Newman wrote later that the sentimentalist Opéra-Comique audience was [...] "shocked by the drastic realism of the action" [...] and by the low standing and defective morality of most of the characters. According to the composer Benjamin Godard, Bizet retorted, in response to a compliment, [...] "Don't you see that all these bourgeois have not understood a wretched word of the work I have written for them?" [...] In a different vein, shortly after the work had concluded, Massenet sent Bizet a congratulatory note: [...] "How <b>happy</b> <b>you</b> must be at this time—it's a great success!".|$|E

500|$|In January 2000, {{three months}} after the system's North American launch, Electronic Gaming Monthly offered praise for the game library, stating, [...] "...with triple-A stuff like Soul Calibur, NBA 2K, and soon Crazy Taxi to kick around, we figure you're <b>happy</b> <b>you</b> took the 128-bit plunge." [...] In a retrospective, PC Magazines Jeffrey L. Wilson {{referred}} to Dreamcast's [...] "killer library" [...] and emphasized Sega's creative influence and visual innovation as being at its peak during the lifetime of the system. The staff of Edge agreed with this assessment on Dreamcast's original titles, as well as Sega's arcade conversions, stating that the system [...] "delivered the first games that could meaningfully be described as arcade perfect." [...] GamePro writer Blake Snow referred to the library as being [...] "much celebrated". Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer praised Dreamcast's NAOMI arcade ports, opining [...] "The thrill of playing Crazy Taxi in the arcade knowing full well that a pixel-perfect conversion (and not some cut-down port) was set to arrive on the Dreamcast is an experience gamers are unlikely to witness again." [...] Nick Montfort and Mia Consalvo, writing in Loading... The Journal of the Canadian Game Studies Association, argued that [...] "the Dreamcast hosted a remarkable amount of videogame development that went beyond the odd and unusual and is interesting when considered as avant-garde... {{it is hard to imagine}} a commercial console game expressing strong resistance to the commodity perspective and to the view that game production is commerce. But even when it comes to resisting commercialization, it is arguable that Dreamcast games came closer to expressing this attitude than any other console games have." [...] 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish favorably compared Sega's Dreamcast output, which included some of [...] "the most varied, creative, and fun [...] the company had ever produced", with its [...] "enervated" [...] status as a third-party. Fahs noted [...] "The Dreamcast's life was fleeting, but it was saturated with memorable titles, most of which were completely new properties." [...] According to author Steven L. Kent, [...] "From Sonic Adventure and Shenmue to Space Channel 5 and Seaman, Dreamcast delivered and delivered and delivered." ...|$|E

[...] So those 50 set-ups [...] might only be 25 set-ups except I'm covering in the set-up. So you're finished. I mean, if you take a little bit more time to prep on three cameras, or if it's a big stunt, eleven cameras, and– whilst it may take 45 minutes to set up– then when you're ready you say 'Action!', and you do three takes, two takes and is everybody <b>happy?</b> <b>You</b> say, 'Yeah, that's it.'

Ashdown said he was astonished at her success in getting earmarks. The overall success rate for earmark requests submitted to Congress is 1 in 4, Ashdown said. In baseball terms that's a [...]250 average. [...] "Letitia White is hitting about [...]600 or [...]700," [...] Ashdown said. [...] "She might be the lobbyist batting champion.

2500|$|Gossip, {{according}} to Robin Dunbar, does for group-living humans what manual grooming does for other primates— it allows individuals to service their relationships and so maintain their alliances. As humans began living in {{larger and larger}} social groups, the task of manually grooming all one's friends and acquaintances became so time-consuming as to be unaffordable. In response to this problem, humans invented [...] "a cheap and ultra-efficient form of grooming"— vocal grooming. [...] To keep your allies <b>happy,</b> <b>you</b> now needed only to [...] "groom" [...] them with low-cost vocal sounds, servicing multiple allies simultaneously while keeping both hands free for other tasks. Vocal grooming (the production of pleasing sounds lacking syntax or combinatorial semantics) then evolved somehow into syntactical speech.|$|E
2500|$|Burton {{was married}} five times, twice {{consecutively}} to Taylor. From 1949 until 1963, {{he was married}} to Sybil, with whom he had two daughters, Kate (born 1957) and Jessica Burton (born 1959). His marriages to Taylor lasted from 15 March 1964 to 26 June 1974 and from 10 October 1975 to 29 July 1976. Their first wedding was at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Montreal. Ever optimistic, Taylor proclaimed, [...] "I'm so <b>happy</b> <b>you</b> can't believe it. This marriage will last forever." [...] Their second wedding took place, sixteen months after their divorce, in Chobe National Park in Botswana. Taylor and Eddie Fisher adopted a daughter from Germany, Maria Burton (born 1 August 1961), who was re-adopted by Burton after he and Taylor married. Burton also re-adopted Taylor and producer Mike Todd's daughter, Elizabeth Frances [...] "Liza" [...] Todd (born 6 August 1957), who had been first adopted by Fisher.|$|E
2500|$|Shantel VanSanten portrays Quinn James, Haley's free {{spirited}} older sister. Fans were unreceptive to {{the character}} at first, but eventually warmed to her. [...] "It's funny. I feel that. I struggle because I take it personally. Obviously, it is a personal thing. Quinn is a character that the writers and myself have developed", said VanSanten. [...] "And {{there was no way}} that I could ever change the way that we started last season where I came into the picture all of a sudden, crying all the time. It was a really emotional thing and it wasn't something that we could really explore a whole lot of. So, I think it was a hard place for people to accept as I came in. I wasn't bubbly and <b>happy.</b> <b>You</b> know?" [...] Quinn is introduced in season 7 when she moves back to Tree Hill after her marriage breaks down.|$|E

Not {{necessarily}} a subject, but we had a direction before we wrote it. As you get older it's more interesting to have a theme that everything tries to support – I would say this album [...] has a theme. I would describe it as an attempt at making an adult breakup record. The consequences to what the characters are going through are more significant. There's just more to it. I'm 37 and the world around me is a lot different than when I was writing breakup songs in my 20s. I tried to reflect that in what the lyrics are." [...] Adkins elaborated: [...] "With Damage the point was love songs. But the type of love songs that interest me deal with adversity and emotional injury. If you have a happy song about how <b>happy</b> <b>you</b> are, I just want to slap you. There's no story there for me. I can't have any empathy." ...|$|E
