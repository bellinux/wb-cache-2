Hence, the {{need to consider the}} implementation of dry coal beneficiation methods as the industry cannot continue relying on the conventional wet processing methods such as heavy medium separation. Dry coal beneficiation with an air dense-medium fluidized bed is one of the dry coal processing methods that have proved to be an efficient separation method with separation efficiencies comparable those of the wet heavy medium separation process. Although the applications of the fluidized bed dry coal separator have been done successfully on an industrial scale, the process has been characterized by relatively poor (<b>Ecart</b> <b>Probable</b> <b>Moyen),</b> Ep values owing to complex hydrodynamics of these systems. Hence, the main objectives {{of this study is to}} develop a sound understanding of the key process parameters which govern the kinetics of coal and shale separation in an air fluidized bed focusing on the effect of the particle size, shape and density on the performance of the fluidized separator as well as developing a simple rise/settling velocity empirical model which can be used to predict the quality of separation. As part of this study, a (40 x 40 x 60) cm air fluidized bed was designed and constructed for the laboratory tests. A relatively uniform and stable average bed density of 1. 64 with STDEV < 0. 01 g/cm 3 was achieved using a mixture of silica and magnetite as the fluidizing media. Different particle size ranges which varied from (+ 9. 5 - 16 mm), (+ 16 - 22 mm), (+ 22 - 31. 5 mm) and (+ 37 - 53 mm) were used for the detailed separation tests. In order to investigate the effect of the particle shape, only three different particle shapes were used namely blockish (+ 16 - 22 mm Blk), flat (+ 16 - 22 mm FB) and sharp pointed prism particles (+ 16 – 22 mm SR). Different techniques were developed for measuring the rise and settling velocities of the particles in the bed. The Klima and Luckie partition model (1989) was used to analyze the partition data for the different particles and high R 2 values ranging from (0. 9210 - 0. 9992) were recorded. Average Ep iii values as low as 0. 05 were recorded for the separation of (+ 37 - 53 mm) and (+ 22 - 31. 5 mm) particles under steady state conditions with minimum fluctuation of the cut density. On the other hand, the separation of the (+ 16 - 22 mm) and (+ 9. 5 – 16 mm) particles was characterized by relatively high average Ep values of 0. 07 and 0. 11 respectively. However the continuous fluctuation or shift of the cut density for the (+ 9. 5 - 16 mm) made it difficult to efficiently separate the particles. Although, particle shape is a difficult parameter to control, the different separation trends that were observed for the (+ 16 - 22 mm) particles of different shapes indicate that particle shape has got a significant effect on the separation performance of the particles in the air fluidized bed. A simple empirical model which can be used to predict the rise/settling velocities or respective positions of the different particles in the air fluidized bed was developed based on the Stokes’ law. The proposed empirical model fitted the rise/settling data for the different particle size ranges very well with R 2 values varying from 0. 8672 to 0. 9935. Validation of the empirical model indicate that the model can be used to accurately predict the rise/settling velocities or respective positions for all the other particles sizes ranges except for the (+ 9. 5 – 16 mm) particles where a relatively high average...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the gravity separation of fine particles in a Reflux Classifier, a fluidized bed device with a system of parallel inclined channels located above. A significant advance is reported here over what was previously possible, through the application of a recent discovery described by Galvin et al. (2009). By using closely spaced inclined channels it is possible to achieve significant suppression of the effects of particle size, and hence produce a powerful separation on the basis of density. Experimental work was undertaken on the continuous steady state separation of coal and mineral matter, with a very narrow channel spacing of 1. 77 mm used to process a feed finer than 0. 5 mm in diameter, and a channel spacing of 4. 2 mm used to process coarser feeds finer than 2. 0 mm. These results are compared with previous findings reported in the literature for wider channels. The gravity separation performance is shown to be remarkably high, with a significant reduction in the variation of the separation density with particle size, and a significant reduction in the <b>Ecart</b> <b>probable</b> error, E p. For example, over the particle size range 0. 25 – 2. 0 mm the composite E p for the size range decreased from 0. 14 for the wide channels used in previous studies to a typical level of 0. 06 for the closely spaced inclined channels used in the present study. The separation performance was also shown to be insensitive to feed pulp density and feed solids throughput over a very broad range...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2005. The South African coal {{industry}} produces a large quantity of coal per annum. The rejects from various unit operations, such as spirals, consist of fine coal that joins the plants tailings dam waste. As existing high quality resources become depleted, {{the need to}} improve recovery of this fine coal grows. This project investigates the use of a teetered bed separator (TBS); a hindered settling gravity concentration device for fine coal recovery. This device has proven successful in the United Kingdom and in Australian collieries for fine coal separation in the size range between 2 mm and 0. 3 mm. It has also been used for decades as a classifying device for silica sand and tin. The TBS operates in the size range of water-only cyclones and spiral concentrators, and could potentially be used to separate a broader size range of coal fines so as to offer a lower footprint device for the fines recovery section of a plant. Spiral concentrators cannot always be operated efficiently at a separating specific gravity of lower than 1. 6; a TBS may also extend the density range for separation and thus improve recovery. The objective of this project was to gain a full understanding of the TBS from fundamental particle interaction and develop a lab scale unit, which is capable of separation to about 0. 1 mm at optimum conditions. This involved the development of design parameters based on the various distributor plates and flow pattern modelling. The hydrodynamics of the separator were investigated using the Eulerian-Eulerian modelling approach of commercial CFD package, Fluent 6. 1. Seven distributor plates of varying aperture size and geometric arrangement were considered. Coal and shale particles, sized between 2 mm and 0. 038 mm with a specific gravity (SG) range of 1. 2 to 2. 0, were separated using the laboratory scale unit. The results of both the simulations and the laboratory tests were then compared. The simulations revealed that Plate 3 was the best option for implementation. It had an even upward velocity profile compared to the other plates, with minimum wall effects and disturbances. The upward water flow rate (teeter water) was varied experimentally and the composition of the teeter bed, underflow and overflow were analysed using 1. 5, 2 and Smm cubic density tracers with an SG range of 1. 2 - 2. 0. Analysis of the partition curves of the distributor plates revealed that Plate 3 had the lowest <b>Ecart</b> <b>Probable</b> (Ep) and cut- point densities. The comparison of simulated results and experimental results show that the simulator could predict the distributor plate design with the lowest Ep in practical tests. The simulator could be beneficial when optimising an industrial scale unit, by allowing prediction of improved segregation patterns and thus separation efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{generalised}} 2 D segregation-dispersion model of the Reflux Classifier applicable to continuous processing, for describing the internal state of the system, and for describing dynamic, and steady state separations. The Reflux Classifier is a beneficiation device comprising a fluidisation section with a set of parallel inclined channels above, in which particle segregation takes place according to differences in density and/or size. The presence of inclined channels provides a large effective settling area, while also improving the separation performance of the device. Many experimental studies have been conducted using the Reflux Classifier. However, the present study was the first to establish a mathematical model of the Reflux Classifier, for describing separations under continuous conditions. In the present study, a 2 D model of the Reflux Classifier was developed, formulated in terms of the segregation and dispersion of the particles. This new model, written in Fortran 77, involved two main steps. The first was concerned with implementing the Kennedy and Bretton (1966) 1 D segregation-dispersion model, previously used to describe liquid fluidised beds under batch conditions. The predictions of the 1 D model for monocomponent systems in liquid fluidised beds were validated using flux curve analysis. The second step involved the modification of the 1 D segregation-dispersion model into a 2 D model of the Reflux Classifier. According to the segregation-dispersion model (Kennedy and Bretton, 1966), the net flux of any given particle species relative to the vessel consists of two components, namely the segregation and dispersion fluxes. The segregation flux in a monocomponent system was described using the hindered settling model of Richardson and Zaki (1954), modified to obtain the particle velocity relative to the fluid. For systems comprising particle species of different sizes and densities, the segregation flux was evaluated using a modified form of the Richardson and Zaki model, proposed by Asif (1997). The hindered settling model of Asif (1997) is effectively a constitutive model that incorporates both the effects of particle size and density, including the local suspension density on the slip velocity of a given particle species (Asif, 1997; Galvin et al. 1999 a, b). The dispersion flux in the fluidisation section was determined using fixed values of the dispersion coefficient in the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) directions, as fitting parameters. Similarly, within the inclined section, a fixed value of the dispersion coefficient was adopted in the tangential direction (y direction). In contrast, in the normal direction (x direction) within the inclined section, a laminar shear mechanism, i. e. shear-induced lift, was incorporated as a contribution to dispersion in the x direction. The 2 D segregation-dispersion model of the Reflux Classifier has been utilised to describe the transport behaviour of single, binary and multicomponent species. In particular, the 2 D model was used to investigate the separation of a coal feed. The feed was composed of 35 particle species having 7 different densities and 5 different sizes. The work was initially undertaken in the absence of shear-induced lift, circumstances that arose when the Reflux Classifier was operated at full scale with wide channels (Galvin et al., 2005). The values of the separation relative density, D 50, and <b>Ecart</b> <b>Probable</b> Error, Ep, obtained from the model predictions accurately matched the experimental results for particles whose sizes were in the range 0. 25 - 2. 0 mm. Additional studies were performed using a feed formed from 42 particles species (coal feed) having 7 different densities and 6 different sizes. These studies included the modelling of the shear-induced lift, previously observed experimentally in the closely spaced inclined channels of the Reflux Classifier (Galvin et al., 2010 c). The corresponding partition curves for the particle size range 0. 25 - 2. 0 mm and the D 50 and Ep values were validated using the reported experimental data sets. In order to explore the generality of the model, a comparative study of a low-density feed (coal) and a high-density feed (iron ore) was also conducted. The study showed that at lower fluidisation velocities the normalised overall Ep* values for both cases were low and consistent with a good separation performance. The segregation-dispersion model of the Reflux Classifier for describing a continuous process provided a realistic model of the system. The model permitted the feed, fluidisation velocity and underflow flux to be specified. The model then described the internal suspension density, total and individual solid volume fractions, concentration changes with time, and provided the partition curves for the individual size fractions, and hence the variation of the D 50 and Ep with particle size. From this information, it was also possible to predict the fractional and cumulative product ash values. Overall, the model of the Reflux Classifier provided the essential physics of this complex system, based on a simple hindered settling model. Moreover, the 2 D segregation-dispersion model of the Reflux Classifier provided a framework in which alternative hindered settling models, dispersion models and descriptions of the shear-induced lift could be inserted...|$|R
