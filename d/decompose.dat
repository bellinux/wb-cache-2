40|$|In {{the area}} of process mining, <b>decomposed</b> replay has been {{proposed}} {{to be able to}} deal with nets and logs containing many different activities. The main assumption behind this decomposition is that replaying many subnets and sublogs containing only some activities is faster then replaying a single net and log containing many activities. Although for many nets and logs this assumption does hold, there are also nets and logs for which it does not hold. This paper shows an example net and log for which the <b>decomposed</b> replay may take way more time, and provides an explanation why this is the case. Next, to mitigate this problem, this paper proposes an alternative <b>decomposed</b> replay, and shows that this alternative <b>decomposed</b> replay is faster than the monolithic replay even for the problematic cases as identified earlier. owever, the alternative <b>decomposed</b> replay is often slower than the original <b>decomposed</b> approach.

The most stable class of polonium compounds are polonides, which are prepared by direct reaction of two elements. Na2Po has the antifluorite structure, the polonides of Ca, Ba, Hg, Pb and lanthanides form a NaCl lattice, BePo and CdPo have the wurtzite and MgPo the nickel arsenide structure. Most polonides <b>decompose</b> upon heating to about 600°C, except for HgPo that decomposes at ~300°C and the lanthanide polonides, which do not <b>decompose</b> but melt at temperatures above 1000°C.

5|$|Lead dihalides are well-characterized; this {{includes}} the diastatide, and mixed halides, such as PbFCl. The relative insolubility of the latter forms a useful basis for the gravimetric determination of fluorine. The difluoride was the first solid ionically conducting compound to be discovered (in 1834, by Michael Faraday). The other dihalides <b>decompose</b> on exposure to ultraviolet or visible light, especially the diiodide. Many lead pseudohalides are known.

Thorium forms the monocapped trigonal prismatic anion 3−, heptamethylthorate, which forms the salt 3 (tmeda = Me2NCH2CH2NMe2). Although one methyl group is only attached to the thorium atom (Th–C distance 257.1pm) and the other six connect the lithium and thorium atoms (Th–C distances 265.5–276.5pm) they behave equivalently in solution. Tetramethylthorium, Th(CH3)4, is not known, but its adducts are stabilised by phosphine ligands.|$|E

All four heavier pnictogens (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth) also form binary thorium compounds. Thorium germanides are also known. Thorium reacts with hydrogen to form the thorium hydrides ThH2 and Th4H15, the latter of which is superconducting below 7.5–8K; at standard temperature and pressure, it conducts electricity like a metal.

5|$|Ariel is {{the fourth}} largest of the Uranian moons, and may have the third {{greatest}} mass. The moon's density is 1.66g/cm3, which indicates that it consists of roughly equal parts water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could consist of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of}} the moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Ariel's leading hemisphere than on its trailing hemisphere. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to bombardment by charged particles from Uranus's magnetosphere, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to sputter water ice, <b>decompose</b> methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.|$|E
