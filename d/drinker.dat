This study aimed to test whether subthreshold problem <b>drinkers</b> were a distinct subgroup of undiagnosed <b>drinkers</b> according to the DSM- 5 AUD classification by investigating drinking patterns and longitudinal trajectories. Data were collected in the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors from young Swiss men in their early twenties (n[*]=[*] 4, 630) at two time points.

The trends showed that 29. 4 % of them remained subthreshold problem <b>drinkers</b> over time.

40|$|International audienceABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: A {{history of}} {{prolonged}} and excessive {{consumption of alcohol}} increases the risk for infections. The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate circulating white blood cells (WBC) differentiated by flow cytometry and neutrophil CD 64 expression in excessive alcohol <b>drinkers</b> versus abstinent or moderate <b>drinkers,</b> and in those with or without infection, in medical patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: All patients admitted between September 2009 and March 2010 with an ICU-stay of 3 days or more were eligible for inclusion. Upon admission, hematological exams were conducted by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Overall, 281 adult were included, with 37 % identified as at-risk <b>drinkers.</b> The only significant difference found in circulating WBC between at-risk and not-at-risk <b>drinkers</b> was a lower number of B lymphocytes in at-risk <b>drinkers</b> (P = 0. 002). Four groups of patients were defined: not-at-risk <b>drinkers</b> with no infection (n = 66); not-at-risk <b>drinkers</b> with infection (n = 112); at-risk <b>drinkers</b> with no infection (n = 53); and at-risk <b>drinkers</b> with infection (n = 50). Whilst the presence of infection significantly reduced levels of noncytotoxic and cytotoxic T lymphocytes and significantly increased levels of CD 16 [...] monocytes in not-at-risk <b>drinkers,</b> with variation related to infection severity, infection had no effect on any of the variables assessed in at-risk <b>drinkers.</b> Post-hoc comparisons showed that B-lymphocyte, noncytotoxic, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte and CD 16 [...] counts in at-risk <b>drinkers</b> were similar to those in not-at-risk <b>drinkers</b> with infection and significantly lower than those in not-at-risk <b>drinkers</b> without infection. Neutrophil CD 64 index varied significantly between groups, with variations related to infection, not previous alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that chronic alcohol exposure has an impact on the immune response to infection in critically ill medical patients. The absence of significant variations in circulating WBC seen in at-risk <b>drinkers</b> according to the severity of infection is suggestive of altered immune response...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine if problem <b>drinkers</b> have varying risks of having alcohol-related dis-eases {{according}} to their reported beverage consumed. Methods: In a cross-sectional study all consecutive inpatients aged 18 – 64 years from four general hospitals of one catchment area were systematically screened for alcohol use. A total of 1011 men with problem drinking were used for this study. Routine treatment diagnoses for all participants were provided by hospital physicians and were classified into three categories according to their alcohol-attributable fractions (AAF; AAF = 0; AAF < 1; AAF = 1). Results: According to their reported beverage consumed, 53. 0 % of the participants were identified as exclusively beer <b>drinkers,</b> 14. 1 % exclusively spirits <b>drinkers,</b> 26. 0 % mixed beer and spirits <b>drinkers</b> and 6. 9 % individuals drinking wine exclusively or in combination with one or two other beverages (mixed wine <b>drinkers).</b> Compared to spirits <b>drinkers</b> and controlling for possible confounders (i. e. alcohol-associated characteristics, demographic variables), multinomial regressions revealed that beer <b>drinkers,</b> mixed beer and spirits <b>drinkers,</b> and mixed wine <b>drinkers</b> had lower odds of having diseases with AAF = 1 than spirits <b>drinkers</b> (e. g. for AAF = 1 : bee...|$|R
40|$|RATIONALE: A robust {{finding in}} the alcohol {{literature}} is that heavy and alcohol-dependent <b>drinkers</b> show stronger reactions to alcohol-related cues than light <b>drinkers.</b> However, there are individual differences {{in the degree of}} cue-elicited craving. Personality factors appear to be involved in cue reactivity and impulsivity is a possible candidate. OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the role of different aspects of impulsivity in heavy drinking and alcohol cue reactivity in social <b>drinkers.</b> METHODS: Participants were heavy (n = 13) and light (n = 29) social <b>drinkers</b> who were exposed to neutral and alcohol-related stimuli during a single laboratory session. Trait impulsivity, response inhibition, and sensitivity to reward were assessed with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS- 11), the Stop Signal Task, and the Card-Arranging Reward Responsivity Objective Test, respectively. RESULTS: Heavy <b>drinkers</b> scored higher on trait impulsivity (BIS- 11) than light <b>drinkers.</b> In addition, heavy <b>drinkers</b> reported elevated levels of craving for alcohol, but both in light and heavy <b>drinkers,</b> craving increased equally after exposure to alcohol cues. Impulsivity appeared to moderate this relation: heavy <b>drinkers</b> with ineffective response inhibition showed more craving to alcohol cues, compared to heavy <b>drinkers</b> with adequate response inhibition. In light <b>drinkers,</b> response inhibition did not influence craving to alcohol cues. CONCLUSIONS: Different aspects of impulsivity are involved in heavy drinking and perhaps motivate alcohol consumption in a variety of ways. Having a deficient response inhibition appears to be a risk factor for heavy <b>drinkers</b> because it is associated with increased craving to alcohol cues...|$|R

50|$|Benefits from self-affirmation {{are thought}} to {{primarily}} occur when the perceived threat is {{in an area of}} importance to the individual.

40|$|Objective: Desire {{thinking}} is a voluntary cognitive process involving verbal and imaginary elaboration of a desired target. Recent research has highlighted {{the role of}} desire thinking in predicting addictive behaviours independent of other psychological constructs including negative affect and craving. The goal of this research project was to explore the role of desire thinking across the continuum of drinking behaviour. Methods: A sample of alcohol-dependent <b>drinkers</b> (n = 43), problem <b>drinkers</b> (n = 59), and social <b>drinkers</b> (n = 68) completed self-report instruments of desire thinking, negative affect, craving and drinking behaviour. Results: Analyses revealed that alcohol-dependent <b>drinkers</b> and problem <b>drinkers</b> scored higher than social <b>drinkers</b> on imaginal prefiguration, and that alcohol-dependent <b>drinkers</b> scored higher than problem <b>drinkers</b> who in turn scored higher than social <b>drinkers</b> on verbal perseveration. A multi-group discriminant analysis showed that craving, imaginal prefiguration and verbal perseveration loaded on a first function whilst age loaded on a second function. The variables correctly classified 75. 9 % of cases. Conclusions: The findings suggest that desire thinking may be a risk factor across the continuum of drinking behaviour and that treatment may benefit from specifically targeting this cognitive process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Aims: The {{impact of}} {{emotional}} states on alcohol craving {{has so far}} mainly been investigated in abstinent and actively consuming alcohol addicts. Alcohol craving and the variables that influence alcohol craving {{have not yet been}} examined in non-addicted, alcohol abusing <b>drinkers</b> and non-abusing occasional alcohol <b>drinkers.</b> Methods: In this study 50 problem <b>drinkers</b> and 50 occasional alcohol <b>drinkers</b> were investigated. The impact of various craving-related variables such as stress and distress, alcohol effect expectancies, and stress coping strategies on reward and relief craving was examined and compared between the groups. Results: Whereas most occasional <b>drinkers</b> reported little alcohol craving, problem <b>drinkers</b> showed a significantly higher amount of reward and relief craving accompanied by increased levels of stress–distress and a stronger tendency to use negative (inadequate) coping strategies. Stress-distress and alcohol effect expectancies were significant predictors of reward and relief craving in problem <b>drinkers.</b> In occasional <b>drinkers</b> alcohol craving was not related to any of these variables. These variables were also found to be predictive of craving in alcohol addicts. Conclusions: We hypothesized, that in non-addicted problem <b>drinkers</b> the expected rewarding and reinforcing alcohol effects lead to an early stage of addictive behaviour. Therefore, in this stage therapeutic interventions focussing on the awareness of the function of alcohol intake as well as alternative coping skills might be useful to prevent alcohol dependence in problem <b>drinkers...</b>|$|R
