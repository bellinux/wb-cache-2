5|$|Cordyline australis is a light-demanding pioneer species, and {{seedlings}} die when overtopped {{by other}} trees. To grow well, young plants require open space {{so they are}} not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes unless there are wet depressions present, and from hillsides {{unless there is a}} seepage area. The <b>fertility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> is another factor—settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the <b>fertility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why C.australis is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.|$|E
5|$|Malagasy farmers {{continue}} to use fire to clear out agricultural land and pasture for livestock, promoting grass growth while inhibiting forest regeneration. The fires sometimes burn {{out of control and}} destroy forest edges along with the natural flora, increasing the damage even further than intended. Due to the nature of Madagascar's geology and soil, tavy also depletes the <b>fertility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> accelerating the crop rotation rate and necessitating expansion into primary forests.|$|E

Perhaps the most significant of the traditions is the maypole, around which traditional dancers circle with ribbons.|$|E

25|$|The Egyptians' {{vision of}} time was {{influenced}} by their environment. Each day the sun rose and set, bringing light {{to the land and}} regulating human activity; each year the Nile flooded, renewing the <b>fertility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> and allowing the highly productive agriculture that sustained Egyptian civilization. These periodic events inspired the Egyptians to see all of time as a series of recurring patterns regulated by maat, renewing the gods and the universe. Although the Egyptians recognized that different historical eras differ in their particulars, mythic patterns dominate the Egyptian perception of history.|$|E
25|$|When cotton {{was king}} during the 1850s, Mississippi {{plantation}} owners—especially {{those of the}} Delta and Black Belt central regions—became wealthy due to the high <b>fertility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> {{the high price of}} cotton on the international market, and their assets in slaves. They used the profits to buy more cotton land and more slaves. The planters' dependence on hundreds of thousands of slaves for labor and the severe wealth imbalances among whites, played strong roles both in state politics and in planters' support for secession. The state was thinly settled, with population concentrated in the riverfront areas and towns.|$|E
25|$|In Punjab the {{consumption}} of fertiliser per hectare is 223.46kg as compared to 90kg nationally. The state has been awarded the National Productivity Award for agriculture extension services for ten years, from 1991–92 to 1998–99 and from 2001 to 2003–04. In recent years a drop in productivity has been observed, mainly due to falling <b>fertility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> This {{is believed to be}} due to excessive use of fertilisers and pesticides over the years. Another worry is the rapidly falling water table on which almost 90% of the agriculture depends; alarming drops have been witnessed in recent years.

25|$|In the pre-Hispanic era, the Bajio saw {{the most}} human {{development}} {{due to the}} <b>fertility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> {{and the presence of}} surface water for agriculture. The oldest group to inhabit the area were the people now known as the Chupícuarios, who dominated the center of the Bajío area and were active between 800 BCE and 300 CE. Their largest city is now the site called Chupícuaro, and their influence was widespread being found in the modern states of Zacatecas, Querétaro, Colima, Nayarit, Hidalgo, State of Mexico, Michoacán and Guerrero. Chupícuaro cities were associated with the Toltec city of Tula and when this city fell, these agricultural cities of Guanajuato also went into decline. This and a prolonged drought cause these cities to be abandoned between the 10th and 11th centuries with only the Guamares left ethnically.|$|E
25|$|After the {{foundation}} of Santa Fe de Bogotá, the principal colonial settlement was concentrated in the present-day centre of the city with minor expansion {{on both sides of}} the San Francisco River. The growth of the city in the first centuries was hindered by the presence of the many wetlands and rivers on the Bogotá savanna. One of the motives to establish the capital on the savanna was to take advantage of the favourably cool climate and <b>fertility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> to grow the introduced Old World crop wheat. The political organisation of the territories in what is known today as Colombia established encomiendas in which the indigenous people had to pay tributes to the encomenderos. The Muisca were forced out of the most fertile grounds to live in less favourable areas, yet were obliged to work the good farmlands for the Spanish colonisers.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of Egyptian myth {{is difficult to}} trace. Egyptologists must make educated guesses about its earliest phases, based on written sources that appeared much later. One obvious influence on myth is the Egyptians' natural surroundings. Each day the sun rose and set, bringing light {{to the land and}} regulating human activity; each year the Nile flooded, renewing the <b>fertility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> and allowing the highly productive farming that sustained Egyptian civilization. Thus the Egyptians saw water and the sun as symbols of life and thought of time as a series of natural cycles. This orderly pattern was at constant risk of disruption: unusually low floods resulted in famine, and high floods destroyed crops and buildings. The hospitable Nile valley was surrounded by harsh desert, populated by peoples the Egyptians regarded as uncivilized enemies of order. For these reasons, the Egyptians saw their land as an isolated place of stability, or maat, surrounded and endangered by chaos. These themes—order, chaos, and renewal—appear repeatedly in Egyptian religious thought.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the five}} {{geographical}} {{divisions of the}} Tamil country in Sangam literature, the Marutam region was the most fit for cultivation, as it had the most fertile lands. The prosperity of a farmer depended on getting the necessary sunlight, seasonal rains and the <b>fertility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> Among these elements of nature, sunlight was considered indispensable by the ancient Tamils, because if rains fail other methods of irrigation could be put to use and if the soil wasn't naturally fertile, artificial manuring would enrich the soil. They differentiated the lands {{on the basis of}} fertility and accordingly cultivated the crops that were best suited for the kind of soil. They were Vanpulam (hardland), Menpulam (fertile land), Pinpulam (dry land) and Kalarnilam or Uvarnilam (salty land). Vanpulam in Mullai and Kurinji regions did not yield rich produce, whereas in Menpulam the yield was very good. Dry crops were cultivated on Pinpulam, because of the limited irrigation facilities. The Kalarnilam was unfit for cultivation. Some of the types of soil known to the people of this age were the alluvial soil, red soil, black soil, laterite soil and sandy soil and they knew what crops could be grown on each type of soil.|$|E
500|$|Lime, {{produced}} by burning limestone, {{was used to}} neutralize acidity and improve the <b>fertility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> in the Shawnee area.

A barn, [...] long by [...] was built which could hold some hundred tons of grain when full, with room to store forty acres of wheat and twenty acres of oats.

30|$|In general, <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{grazing land}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study area was higher in most <b>fertility</b> status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> {{physicochemical}} properties such as total porosity, soil pH (H 2 O), electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon (OC), exchangeable bases (Ca, Mg, K and Na), CEC, percent base saturation (PBS) and Zn {{as compared to}} the forest land and cultivated land. On the other hand, the forest land was higher in most <b>fertility</b> status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> physicochemical properties than the cultivated land. This indicates that the grazing land had high biomass that contributed to its high OC content and characterized with minimum soil disturbance.
