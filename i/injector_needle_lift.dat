Combustion chamber pressure was also acquired, and the rate of heat-release curves were computed by means of a zero-dimensional one-zone combustion model. Some macro-parameters of the combustion process were obtained from the heat-release-rate curves. The injection system was separated from the engine and tested on a special test bench.

40|$|Among the {{alternative}} fuels, hydrogen shows great {{potential in the}} near future. In the present study, hydrogen utilization as diesel engine fuel was investigated. Hydrogen {{can not be used}} directly in a diesel engine due to its autoignition temperature higher than that of diesel fuel. One alternative method is to use hydrogen in enrichment or induction. To investigate the combustion characteristics of this dual fuel engine, a single cylinder diesel research engine was converted to utilize hydrogen as fuel. Hydrogen was introduced to the intake manifold using a mixer before entering the combustion chamber. The engine was run at a constant speed of 2000 rpm and variable loads. At each load step the flow rate of hydrogen was varied. Fuel consumption, <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> <b>lift</b> movement, and cylinder pressure were measured. Introducing hydrogen to the combustion chamber reduced the diesel fuel consumption. Indicated efficiency slightly increases with hydrogen enrichment at 15 Nm load. At lower load the efficiency decreases. Specific energy consumption increases with increase in hydrogen flow rate at 5 and 10 Nm load. Inversely, it decreases at higher load. Cylinder pressure decreases with hydrogen enrichment at 5 and 10 Nm, but slightly increases at higher loa...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{experimental and}} theoretical results obtained for a mechanical Diesel fuel injection system, {{made up of}} a distributor-type pump, four delivery pipes and four four-hole injectors. Pressure in the pumping chamber, in two locations along the fuel line and within the injector is measured directly, as well as the <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> <b>lift.</b> The flow rate is evaluated through the measure of pressure in the injection chamber. Experimental results are sustained by theoretical results. The numerical model considers systems of ordinary differential equations representing the operation of injector, pump, delivery valve and line volume elements. Only a few model details are presented. Similar approaches are in use by many years, and the accuracy they provide is generally accepted to be fairly good. Theoretical and experimental results are presented vs. the time at different pump speeds, showing a very satisfactory accuracy. The main objective of the paper is to describe the unsteady flow within the injector, and to show differences with reference to the steady flow. Despite the subject is not adequately covered in the open literature, several reasons suggest that steady and unsteady flow behaviors differ considerably. These differences may affect the prediction of both injection pressure and flow rate...|$|E
40|$|The {{ignition}} delay in a diesel engine {{is defined as}} the time (or crank angle) interval between the start of injection and the start of combustion. The start of injection is usually taken as the time when the <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> <b>lifts</b> off its seal. The start of combustion is more difficult to determine precisely. Both physical and chemical processes must take place before a significant fraction of the chemical energy of the injected liquid fuel is released. The physical processes are: the atomization of the liquid fuel jet, the vaporization of the fuel droplets, the mixing of fuel vapor with air. The chemical processes are the pre-combustion reactions of the fuel, air, residual gas mixture which lead to auto ignition.

40|$|It {{is known}} that there exists a time period between the instant when the {{conditions}} for combustion are settled {{and the start of}} combustion, this induction stage is called ignition delay. The ignition delay is important for the control of diesel engines. However, in the Chalmers High Pressure High Temperature (HP/HT) spray rig it has been observed that the ignition delay varies from injection to injection. This study was performed to investigate the variation of ignition delay as a function of gas pressure, gas temperature, injection pressure and injection duration. Diesel fuel was injected into the Chalmers HP/HT rig containing hot and pressurised air using a common rail injection system. Pressure and temperature in the combustion chamber were controlled and varied as well as the injection pressure using medium or long injections. The spray combustion was filmed using a high speed camera and the ignition delay was measured with a photodiode taking as a threshold of start of ignition the beginning of light emission by the flame. The control pulse given to the <b>injector,</b> the <b>needle</b> <b>lift</b> and the photodiode signal were controlled, registered and measured by a computer.

40|$|The spray {{characteristics}} and spray stability from three prototype piezoelectric pintle-type injectors were investigated under different operating conditions in an optical direct injection engine designed for stratified combustion. The pintle-type outwards opening injector {{has the potential}} to address and overcome many of the typical problems related to close-spacing, spray-guided configurations owing to its hollow cone spray, exhibiting better air utilization than multihole sprays, with good penetration during early injection, and a spray angle almost independent of cylinder backpressure. The three prototype injectors have different nozzle exit geometries for optimization of spray stability under all engine operating conditions. The emerging fuel sprays for both single- and double-injection operation were visualized using Mie scattering and a high-speed CCD camera. The performance of the injectors was assessed by constructing mean and RMS images at different operating conditions of injection pressure, backpressure, <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> <b>lift,</b> and engine speed. From these images, a spray angle analysis was performed by comparing the mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum cone angle under different operating conditions; the spray stability was quantified by analysing the mean and RMS images and the mean and RMS spray cone angles. Evaluation of the three prototypes has revealed that the positive-step inward seal band design produces the most robust spray angle ideally suited for stratified fuel/air mixture formation and combustion in spray-guided direct injection spark ignition (DISI) gasoline engines...|$|E
40|$|A {{production}} distributor-type fuel-injection {{system for}} diesel engines has been extensively investigated via computer-assisted simulation and experimentation. The investigation was mainly aimed at assessing and validating a sophisticated computational model of the system, developed with specific attention given to the pump and to some important aspects concerning the injection pressure simulation, such as the dynamic effects of the <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> <b>lift,</b> the flow unsteadiness, and compressibility effects on the nozzle-hole discharge coefficient. The pump delivery assembly was provided with a valve of the reflux type. This presented a flat in the collar, forming a return-flow restriction with the seat, and had no retraction piston. A single-spring injector, with a reduced sac volume, was fitted to the system. The numerical analysis of transient flow phenomena linked to the mechanical unit dynamics, including possible cavitation occurrence in the system, was performed using an implicit finite-difference algorithm, previously set up for in-line injection equipment. Particular care was exercised in modeling the distributor pump so as to match {{the dynamics of the}} delivery-valve assembly to the pressure wave propagation in the distributor and its outlets. The so-called minor losses were also taken into account and it was ascertained that sudden expansion and contraction losses were significant for the type of pump examined.

40|$|Alinear optical {{displacement}} sensorwas {{designed to}} overcome the problems related to the sensitivity of traditional transducers to electromagnetic disturbance, when applied to the measurement of needle lift in electrically actuated Diesel fuel injectors. The sensor consisted of a laser light emitter, a receiver, and a device used for modulating {{the intensity of the}} light reaching the receiver in function of position of the moving element. Thus, two rectangular windows were mounted on the injector body, while a third window was rigidly connected to the needle control piston, and aligned with the fixed ones, to obtain a clearance area which varied linearly with needle position. An optical fibre cable was used to transfer the laser light from the source to one of the fixed window, while a similar cable was connected between the second window and the receiver. Hence, the intensity of the light reaching the receiver was proportional to the position of the injector needle. Light intensity was converted into an equivalent voltage, and this signal was fed to the data acquisition system. The <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> <b>lift</b> curves were measured and compared with those obtained with a commercial eddy current sensor. The reliability of the sensor was further improved by designing a suitable gasket that prevented fuel oil from reaching the optical windows, thus avoiding the onset of fluid cavitation, which would have resulted in bubble formation and consequent random laser light scattering, hence measurement alteratio...|$|E
40|$|Modeling of fuel {{injection}} equipment is a tool that is used increasingly for explaining or predicting the effect of advanced diesel injection strategies on combustion and emissions. This paper reports on the modeling of the high-pressure part of a research type Heavy Duty Common Rail (CR) {{fuel injection}} system. More specifically, it reports on the observed dynamics of the injection system and the capability of the model to capture this. For that reason, the total high-pressure part of the injection system, i. e. the fuel pump, rail and injector, has been modeled using the AMESim code (Imagine S. A., 2004). The reliability of the resulting hydraulic model is tested through a comparison between numerical results and actual injection measurements. This detailed comparison is based on measurements of injected mass flow rate, <b>needle</b> <b>lift</b> and pressure oscillations in the injection duct {{for a series of}} single injection events. It is shown that the hydraulic model is able to accurately simulate the injection rate, <b>needle</b> <b>lift</b> and injection pressure for different rail pressure levels. For accurate numerical results, it is vital that the stiffness of the <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> assembly and the discharge coefficients of the different flow restrictions in the injector (e. g. nozzle holes) are correctly modeled. Assuming a rigid <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> results in a too early start of injection. Discharge coefficient values found in literature shows a wide spread. This makes it very difficult to simulate the injected mass flow rate accurately on the basis of literature data. Using the measured injected mass of fuel to tune the discharge coefficient, together with the inclusion of the elasticity of the <b>injector</b> <b>needle,</b> results in a good approximation of the injection rate...|$|R
40|$|Fuel direct {{injection}} {{represents one of}} the key turning points {{in the development of the}} Diesel engines. The appeal of this solution has been growing thanks to the parallel advancement in the technology of the injection hardware and in the knowledge of the physics involved in the spray formation and combustion. In the present thesis, the effect of partial <b>needle</b> <b>lift</b> and injection rate shaping has been investigated experimentally using a multi-orifice Diesel injector. Injection rate shaping is one of the most attractive alternatives to multiple injection strategies but its implementation has been for long time impeded by technological limitations. A novel direct-acting injector prototype made it possible to carry out the present research: this injector features a mechanical coupling between the nozzle needle and the piezo-stack actuator, allowing a fully flexible control on the nozzle needle movement and enabling partial <b>needle</b> <b>lift</b> as well as the implementation of alternative injection rate shapes typologies. Different optical diagnostics were applied to study the spray development and combustion in a novel continuous flow test chamber that allows an accurate control on a wide range of thermodynamic conditions (up to 1000 K and 15 MPa). In addition, hydraulic characterization tests were carried out to analyze the fuel flow through the <b>injector</b> nozzle. Partial <b>needle</b> <b>lift</b> has been found to affect the injection event, reducing the mass flow rate (as expected) but also causing a reduction in the effective orifice area and an increase on the spreading angle. Moreover, at this condition, higher hole-to-hole dispersion and flow instabilities were detected. Needle vibrations caused by the needle interactions with fuel flow and by the onset of cavitation in the needle seat are likely the causes of this behavior. Injection rate shaping has a substantial impact on the premixed phase of the combustion and on the location where the ignition takes place. Furthermore, the results proved that the modifications in the internal flow caused by the partial <b>needle</b> <b>lift</b> are reflected on the ignition timing. On the other hand, the analysis of the experimental data through a 1 D spray model revealed that an increasing mass flow rate (e. g. ramp or boot injection rate profiles) causes an increase in the fuelair equivalence ratio at the lift-off length and a consequent higher soot formation during the diffusive phase of the combustion. Finally, the wide range of boundary conditions tested in all the experiments served to draw general conclusions about the physics involved in the injection/combustion event and, in some cases, to obtain statistical correlations.

40|$|A general {{conservative}} {{numerical model}} for simulation of transmission-line unsteady fluid-dynamics {{has been developed}} and applied to high-pressure injection systems. A comprehensive thermodynamic approach for modeling acoustic cavitation, i. e. cavitation induced by wave propagation, was proposed {{on the basis of}} a homogeneous barotropic mixture model of a pure liquid in equilibrium with its vapor and a gas, both dissolved and undissolved. For the pure liquid flow simulation outside the cavitation regions, or in the absence of these, temperature variations due to compressibility effects were taken into account, for the first time in injection system simulation, through a thermodynamic state equation which was derived from energy considerations. Nevertheless, in the cavitation regions, an isothermal flow was retained which is consistent with negligible thermal effects due to vaporization because of the tiny amounts of liquid involved. A novel implicit, conservative, one step, symmetrical and trapezoidal scheme of the second-order accuracy was applied to solve the hyperbolic partial differential equations governing the pipe flows. It can also be enhanced at a high-resolution level. The numerical model was applied to wave propagation and cavitation simulation in a high-pressure injection system of the pump-line-nozzle type for light and medium duty vehicles. The system was of relevance to the model assessment because it presented severely cavitating flow conditions. The predicted pressure time histories at two pipe locations and <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> <b>lift</b> were compared to experimental results, substantiating the validity and robustness of the developed conservative model in simulating cavitation inception and desinence with great degree of accuracy.

40|$|Despite {{significant}} {{advances in}} electronic control technology applied to diesel engines, commercially available injection sys tems for automotive diesel engines remain {{limited by the}} open loop mapplng of the injection pump. An initial calibration is relied upon to translate a fuel delivery command to an actual fuel quantity. In practice, however, these two variables may be sub stantially different due {{to the effects of}} mechanical wear, repair, and the wide range of operating conditions. Possible ramifications of this discrepancy are excessive exhaust smoke due to overfuel ing, increased fuel consumption, degraded driveability, and poor idle characteristics. The major obstacle to closing the fuel control loop is the lack of a suitable sensor for instantaneous fuel delivery from the injector. An indirect fuel delivery sensing mechanism based upon the use of the <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> <b>lift</b> in conjunction with the fuel tempera ture is evaluated. An estimation of the injection rate characteristic is determined from real-time analysis of the needle lift signal using a high-speed sensor processor. Integration of the rate characteris tic and temperature correction yields a total mass delivery estimate for use as a feedback quantity for closed-loop fuel control. Signal processing algorithms are derived from computer modeling of the injector and verified experimentally. Possible long-term decalibra tion due to nozzle coking is studied. Advantages and limitations of the technique are identified.

A prototype CNG fuel injector assembly was designed, which primarily included magnetostrictive material Terfenol-D as the actuator material, 1020 Steel having soft magnetic properties as the injector housing material, AWG copper wire as the coil material and 316 Stainless Steel having non-magnetic properties as the plunger material. A 2 D cross-sectional geometry including the injector housing, coil, Terfenol-D shaft, and plunger, was modeled in both Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM) and ANSYS for 2 D axisymmetric magnetic simulation.

Subsequently, a three dimensional replica of the CNG flow conduit was modelled in GAMBIT with the resultant injector lift. The meshed conduit was then simulated in FLUENT using the 3 D time independent segregated solver with standard k-ε, realizable k-ε and RSM turbulent models to predict the mass flow rate of CNG to be injected.

Material and Methods: Fine needle aspiration biopsy was done on the resected material from a total of 70 patients (67 male and 3 female) {{with a mean age of}} 58. 17 years (range: 38 - 75 years) who underwent surgery for prediagnosed malignancy. For each surgically resected material, the cytological and histopathological findings of the internal aspirates from both the Chiba and <b>injector</b> <b>needles</b> as well as the smears from the external surfaces of these needles were compared. Results: Of the 70 biopsy materials obtained by the Chiba needle, malignancy was demonstrated in 58, benign lesions in one, while 11 were non-diagnostic. The results obtained with the <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> revealed 58 malignancies, and 12, without any diagnosis. With both techniques, no false positive results were&nbsp;observed. The diagnostic sensitivity of the techniques was 84 % and 82 % for the Chiba and <b>injector</b> <b>needles</b> respectively. Examination of the smears obtained from the external surfaces revealed malignant cells in 45 (64. 3 %) of the 70 smears obtained with a Chiba needle and 42 (60 %) of the 70 smears obtained with an <b>injector</b> <b>needle.</b> Conclusions: Fine needle aspiration is a method with high diagnostic value.

40|$|The {{flow and}} mixing {{behaviour}} of high pressure directly injected fuel {{is important in}} the study of spark-ignition engines owing to its strong influence on the combustion process. This in turn governs emissions and power generation, which are important considerations in contemporary vehicle design. Whilst liquid fuel delivery has and continues to be a topic of detailed research, there is a deficit in the understanding of gaseous fuel delivery. Three topics remain largely neglected for high pressure CNG fuel injection in spark-ignition engines: i. the targeting and dispersion behaviour of the gaseous fuel jet, ii. the transient jet behaviour near the nozzle exit region (&ldquo;nearfield&rdquo;) and iii. the effects of the jets on the in-cylinder flow and turbulence. Using optical diagnostics that include schlieren high-speed imaging and particle image velocimetry (PIV), this work addresses the knowledge deficit. The investigation primarily covers jets issued from a direct injector for gaseous fuels that was constructed in-house. A constant volume chamber was employed to replicate engine-like conditions quiescently, allowing isolation of the injection delivery phenomena. For topic i, jet targeting behaviour was characterised by axial and radial penetration, spread angle and projected area. The targeting profile of a freestream jet is in good agreement with previously established density normalised incompressible jet relationhips. Additionally, empirical correlation is provided between the jet dispersion and pressure ratio (8. 3 &lt; PR &lt; 400) for conditions when the jet impinges on the cylinder boundaries. For topic ii, the <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> <b>lift</b> profile was found to be a dominant factor in controlling nearfield compressible and incompressible flow structures. The presence of the needle was shown to reduce the Mach disc location downstream of the nozzle by ~ 45 %, at steady-state conditions. Moreover, in transient conditions the Mach disc location and diameter are shown to correlate strongly with the needle lift profile. The high-resolution characterisation of the compressible is important for stratified engine operation where a slightly mistimed jet may result in misfire due to the large velocities across the spark-plug electrode In relation to topic iii, PIV was used to capture the flow velocity in two key regions: the air in the nearfield and the ignition zone where a spark plug would be conventionally placed. The rate of air entrainment into the jet is shown to be proportional to the fuel delivery rate and to steadily increase with increasing delivery time aSOI. Spatially, the nearfield entrainment coefficient, K&rsquo; 2, is shown to remain constant at a mean value of K&rsquo; 2 = 0. 123. Moreover, the displacement of air caused from the impinging induced jet vortices is shown to feed air into the nearfield entrainment region. Consequently, for the highest PR experiments (PR 320 and 400) the nearfield entrainment coefficient, K&rsquo; 2, is shown to increase ~ 65 %, relative to the lower PR experiments. Ignition region turbulent kinetic energy levels induced by the impinging jet are conducive to good flame propagation where mean values (0. 5 - 19 m 2 /s 2) are similar to those created by typical air induction bulk-flow. Mean flow velocities are also within an acceptable spark plug ignition range (1. 8 - 21. 0 m/s). Both flow properties are shown to be heavily influenced by the proximity of the jet boundary. As a result of the ignition and nearfield region measurements, a clear understanding of the transient nearfield processes has been developed to help one design appropriate fuel delivery and combustion strategies...|$|E

Model parameters are derived from a combination of measurement and estimation, and the subsequent model is evaluated via direct measurement of the spring seat displacement. The opening and closing needle impact behaviour is shown to exhibit close correlation with key injection parameters, including fuel injection pressure, fuelling rate and timing. The model revealed that the impact of the needle when opening is found to exhibit lower amplitude but more high‐frequency components than the impact associated with the closing. The measurement of the injector body vibration response to these impacts is shown to enable non‐intrusive estimation of injection parameters, alleviating the problems associated with conventional intrusive needle‐lift measurement.

40|$|Recently, the {{high-pressure}} {{fuel injection}} performance of common-rail direct injection (CRDi) engines {{has become more}} important, due {{to the need to}} improve the multi-injection strategy. A multiple injection strategy provides better emission and fuel economy characteristics than a normal single injection scheme. The CRDi engine performance changes with the type of high-pressure electro-mechanical injector that is used and its injection response in a multi-injection scheme. In this study, a direct needle-driven piezo injector (DPI) was investigated, to optimize its actuation components, including the plate length, number of springs, and the elasticity of the spring between the <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> and the piezo stack. Three prototype DPIs were proposed by this research. They were classified as Type 1, 2, and 3, depending on whether the <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> was hydraulic or mechanical. Then, the optimal prototype was determined by conducting four evaluation experiments analyzing the maximum injection pressure, injection rate, spray visualization, and real engine combustion application. As a result, {{it was found that the}} Type 3 DPI prototype, with several pan-springs and plates, had the highest injection pressure, a steady injection rate, and the fastest spray speed. It also demonstrated the most effective emission reduction for a two-stage rapid spray injection in a single-cylinder CRDi engine. The Type 3 DPI displays an increased elasticity from its hydraulic needle that provides a synergy effect for improving DPI actuation...|$|R
40|$|Part 2 of {{this paper}} {{presents}} the experimental and analytical procedures used in the estimation of injection parameters from monitored vibration. The mechanical and flow‐induced sources of vibration in a fuel injector are detailed and {{the features of the}} resulting vibration response of the injector body are discussed. Experimental engine test and data acquisition procedures are described, and the use of an out‐of‐the‐engine test facility to confirm injection dependent vibration response is outlined. Wigner‐Ville distribution (WVD) analysis of non‐stationary vibration signals monitored on the injector body is used to locate regions of vibration in the time‐frequency plane which are responsive to injection parameters. From the data in these regions, estimates of injection timing and fuel pressure are obtained. Accurate estimation of injection parameters from externally monitored vibration is shown {{to pave the way for}} the detection and diagnosis of injection system faults. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the technique provides an alternative method for the set‐up, checking and adjustment of fuel injection timing.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{modelling}} of a research type Heavy Duty Common Rail (CR) fuel injection system. More specifically it reports on the observed interaction between fuel properties and injection and on the capability to model this. For that reason a hydraulic model of the fuel injection system has been developed using the AMESim code (Imagine S. A., 2003). The reliability of the numerical results is tested through a comparison between numerical and experimental results when using regular diesel fuel. Basis for this detailed comparison are measurements of injected mass flow rate, <b>needle</b> <b>lift</b> and pressure oscillations in the injection duct for a single injection. Simulation results for regular diesel show good agreement with measured data for pressure oscillations in the injection duct, <b>needle</b> <b>lift</b> and injected fuel mass flow rate. A comparison of experimental and simulated results for Rapeseed oil Methyl Ester (RME) also shows good correspondence, which proves the capability of the model to capture the influence of different fuel properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{cavitation}} structures formed inside enlarged transparent {{replicas of}} tapered Diesel valve covered orifice nozzles have been characterized using high speed imaging visualization. Cavitation images obtained at fixed <b>needle</b> <b>lift</b> and flow rate conditions {{have revealed that}} although the conical shape of the converging tapered holes suppresses the formation of geometric cavitation, forming at the entry to the cylindrical injection hole, string cavitation {{has been found to}} prevail, particularly at low <b>needle</b> <b>lifts.</b> Computational fluid dynamics simulations have shown that cavitation strings appear in areas where large-scale vortices develop. The vortical structures are mainly formed upstream of the injection holes due to the nonuniform flow distribution and persist also inside them. Cavitation strings have been frequently observed to link adjacent holes while inspection of identical real-size injectors has revealed cavitation erosion sites in the area of string cavitation development. Image postprocessing has allowed estimation of their frequency of appearance, lifetime, and size along the injection hole length, as function of cavitation and Reynolds numbers and needle lif...|$|R

40|$|Injection rate of a {{gaseous fuel}} {{injector}} {{was calculated by}} measuring the <b>needle</b> valve <b>lift</b> history. In our lab, a gaseous fuel injection rate meter using 1 -dimensional pipe flow was developed. In the present study, the measurement accuracy of the injection rate meter was examined by comparing the theoretical injection rate estimated from the <b>needle</b> valve <b>lift</b> history. The <b>needle</b> valve <b>lift</b> was measured using an optical method. A small beam cut plate {{is attached to the}} needle valve of the gaseous fuel injector. A laser beam passes through the beam cut plate, and the variation of the beam intensity was measured with a photo sensor. From the beam intensity, the <b>needle</b> valve <b>lift</b> history was estimated. One-dimensional, compressible, inviscid, adiabatic flow was assumed, and the instantaneous mass flow rate through the needle valve sheet, the injector sack, and the injection hole was estimated.

It is shown that the injection rate meter has high reliability and accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2015 SAE International. The {{design of}} a Diesel {{injector}} is {{a key factor in}} achieving higher engine efficiency. The injectors fuel atomisation characteristics are also critical for minimising toxic emissions such as unburnt Hydrocarbons (HC). However, when developing injection systems, the small dimensions of the nozzle render optical experimental investigations very challenging under realistic engine conditions. Therefore, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be used instead. For the present work, transient, Volume Of Fluid (VOF), multiphase simulations of the flow inside and immediately downstream of a real-size multi-hole nozzle were performed, during and after the injection event with a small air chamber coupled to the injector downstream of the nozzle exit. A Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach was used to account for turbulence. Grid dependency studies were performed with 200 k- 1. 5 M cells. Both k-ε and k-ω SST models were considered in the validation process, with the k-ω SST found to predict better the injectors flow rate. The cavitation models of Schnerr-Sauer and the Zwart-Gerber-Belamri were employed for validation against optical data of cavitation in a simplified nozzle geometry obtained from the literature. The Schnerr-Sauer model was in better agreement with the experiments, hence this model was subsequently employed for the real injector simulations. The motion of the <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> was modeled by a dynamic grid methodology. An injection pressure of 400 bar was applied at the inlet of the injector. Two outlet pressures were examined, 60 bar and 1 bar. The results showed that the flow was far from steady-state during the injection event and that hysteresis existed between the needle opening and closing phases. This indicated the importance of transient simulations, contrary to widely-used steady state simulations at fixed <b>needle</b> <b>lifts.</b> The two outlet pressures resulted in very different final states of the flow-field in the nozzle. Specifically, the nozzle ended up either full of liquid fuel at the end of injection or full of air after most of the fuel had been ejected into the chamber downstream. These predictions highlighted phenomena that can increase HC emissions due to fuel leakage, as well as processes that may be linked to different formation mechanisms of nozzle deposits...|$|R
