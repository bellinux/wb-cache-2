5|$|Seventy {{percent of}} the United States' electrometallurgical {{ferroalloy}} manufacturing employees are located in Ohio. The <b>entire</b> <b>industry</b> as a whole, although not as concentrated as the electrometallurgical ferroalloy manufacturing sector, employs 34,000 paid workers at 234 individual workplaces. Ohio's 234 workplaces make up 9.5% of the United States industry's workplaces, and the 34,000 paid workers make up 13.6% of the United States industry's workers. Of these workers and workplaces, the sector of iron, steel, and ferroalloys make up the largest sector in Ohio's industry, with 17,000 paid workers in 73 workplaces.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} {{of a change in}} weather was the sudden collapse of the market for specialized AI hardware in 1987. Desktop computers from Apple and IBM had been steadily gaining speed and power and in 1987 they became more powerful than the more expensive Lisp machines made by Symbolics and others. There was no longer a good reason to buy them. An <b>entire</b> <b>industry</b> worth half a billion dollars was demolished overnight.|$|E
5|$|The {{latter half}} of the twentieth century saw the gradual {{evolution}} of synthesizers—instruments that artificially produce sound using analog or digital circuits and microchips. In the late 1960s, Bob Moog and other inventors began an era of development of commercial synthesizers. One of the first of these instruments was the Moog synthesizer. The modern proliferation of computers and microchips has spawned an <b>entire</b> <b>industry</b> around electronic musical instruments.|$|E

5|$|Examination of the {{wreckage}} revealed that large portions of the wings' skin were badly glued and {{that a number of}} rib caps and stringers were not glued at all. Many panel pins were not connected to the structure at all and many of the bradawl holes necessary to equalize pressure between the inside of the wing and the outside were missing entirely. The crash of such an advanced aircraft shocked the <b>entire</b> <b>industry</b> and caused a six-month hiatus in design work. Polikarpov overreacted to its loss and built the structure of a number of his subsequent aircraft stronger, and thus, heavier, than it needed to be. All further work on the project was abandoned following the crash, nominally for lack of a suitable engine.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The <b>entire</b> <b>industry</b> has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

In the process, Westland acquired two potential rivals to the Westminster: the projected Bristol 194 and the Fairey Rotodyne (a gyrodyne design). Rationalisation was necessary and since the Rotodyne was already flying and government funded, work on the Westminster ceased in September 1960.|$|E

25|$|Grass on {{golf courses}} {{is kept in}} three {{distinct}} conditions: that of the rough, the fairway, and the putting green. Grass on the fairway is mown short and even, allowing the player to strike the ball cleanly. Playing from the rough is a disadvantage because the long grass may affect the flight of the ball. Grass on the putting green is the shortest and most even, ideally allowing the ball to roll smoothly over the surface. An <b>entire</b> <b>industry</b> revolves around the development and marketing of grass varieties for golf courses.|$|E
25|$|Soon coffee {{became the}} primary {{commodity}} export of Sri Lanka. Falling coffee prices {{as a result}} of the depression of 1847 stalled economic development and prompted the governor to introduce a series of taxes on firearms, dogs, shops, boats, etc., and to reintroduce a form of rajakariya, requiring six days free labour on roads or payment of a cash equivalent. These harsh measures antagonised the locals, and another rebellion broke out in 1848. A devastating leaf disease, Hemileia vastatrix, struck the coffee plantations in 1869, destroying the <b>entire</b> <b>industry</b> within fifteen years. The British quickly found a replacement: abandoning coffee, they began cultivating tea instead. Tea production in Sri Lanka thrived in the following decades. Large-scale rubber plantations began in the early 20th century.|$|E

25|$|Good Humor was {{not able}} to solve its labor problems. The company was unionized early in its history and was struck on several occasions. For example, in 1950 the Teamsters shut down Good Humor's New York {{operations}} for three weeks during the critical month of June. Beginning in the 1950s, the labor pool dried up and Good Humor operated over half of its fleet with seasonal employees, mostly college students. On average, new employees lasted only two to three weeks because of the long hours. The <b>entire</b> <b>industry,</b> except Good Humor, stopped using commissioned employees and became distributors who leased trucks to the drivers and sold them their products wholesale. Good Humor adopted this system wherever possible but was prevented from converting most branches because of union contracts.|$|E
25|$|Collecting the melange is {{hazardous}} in the extreme, since rhythmic {{activity on}} the desert surface of Arrakis attracts the territorial worms, which are capable of swallowing even the largest mining equipment whole. Harvesting is carried out by a gigantic machine called a Harvester, which is carried to and from a spice blow by a larger craft called a Carryall. The Harvester on the ground has four scouting ornithopters patrolling around it watching for wormsign — the motions of sand indicating that a worm is coming. Melange is collected from the open sand until a worm is close, at which time the Carryall lifts the Harvester to safety. The Fremen, who base their <b>entire</b> <b>industry</b> around the sale of spice and the manufacture of materials out of spice, have learned to co-exist with the sandworms in the desert and harvest the spice manually for their own use and for smuggling off-planet.|$|E
25|$|Vale's {{decision}} of constructing {{a fleet of}} 400,000-ton ore carriers was widely criticized by other shipping companies. The new Valemax ships, expected to cut the company's transportation costs by 20–25%, were blamed for driving down the freight rates for the <b>entire</b> <b>industry,</b> swelling the already oversupplied bulk transportation market and stalling {{the recovery of the}} shipping business after the financial crisis. The freight rates, down 80% from 2008, were expected to drop further down to the levels of 1977. According to the chief executive of BIMCO, the Valemax vessels could displace up to 168 150,000–180,000-ton capesize bulk carriers, around 15% of the existing fleet, from the long haul voyages and force them to less profitable shorter routes. Vale responded to the criticism by stating that the company aims to permanently cut the costs of Atlantic-Pacific dry bulk shipping to make Brazilian ore more competitive against iron ore produced in Australia, which is closer to major customers in Asia.|$|E

25|$|The {{solution}} {{he developed}} was the Miami Beach Railway, an electric street railway system which served the additional purpose of providing electric service. He and other investors formed the Miami Beach Electric Company and the Miami Beach Railway Co. It began service on December 14, 1920 and ran from downtown Miami, where it shared tracks with Miami's own trolley system, to the County Causeway (renamed MacArthur Causeway after World War II). After crossing Biscayne Bay to Miami Beach, the tracks looped around {{the section of}} Miami Beach south of 47th Street. Around 1926, Florida Power and Light acquired Fisher's streetcar system, and expanded it, double tracking the line across the causeway. However, while sale of electric service was a growth industry across the United States, the street railway portion went into a period of decline, along with the <b>entire</b> <b>industry.</b> All rail service between Miami and Miami Beach was terminated on October 17, 1939.|$|E
500|$|Two {{initiatives}} {{begun by}} the Clinton administration under Browner's tenure {{were part of}} its [...] "reinventing government" [...] program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts {{as a way of}} expanding the EPA's flexible public-private partnerships, as an alternative to traditional regulation. Project XL in 1995 was designed to find common sense, cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities, while the Common Sense Initiative in 1994 was targeted at efforts involving <b>entire</b> <b>industry</b> sectors, rather than dealing with issues on a crisis-by-crisis, pollutant-by-pollutant basis. [...] Project XL had mixed results, with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned. [...] The more ambitious Common Sense Initiative, which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some European countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice, showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in 1998.|$|E
