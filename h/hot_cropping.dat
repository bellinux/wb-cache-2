40|$|There {{is a need}} {{to develop}} {{sustainable}} and productive cropping systems for edible vegetable oilseeds in tropical Africa. Field trials were conducted during the late cropping season (July–Nov.) of 2001 and 2002 to determine the grain yields, and other yield attributes of sunflower and soyabeans and their productivity under monocropping and intercropping. Three sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) varieties (a local adapted var. Funtua and two exotic varieties Isaanka and Record from Argentina) and five improved, high yielding soyabean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) varieties: TGx 1448 - 2 E (late), TGx 1440 - 1 E (late), TGx 1019 - 2 EB (medium), TGx 1740 - 2 F (early) and TGx 1485 - 1 D (early maturing) were used. Funtua had significantly greater head weight and diameter, achene number and weight per head than Isaanka and Record during the dry and relatively <b>hot</b> <b>cropping</b> season of 2001. Cropping system significantly reduced soyabean grain yield in intercropping, relative to monocropping, except when soyabean was intercropped with Isaanka in 2001 and Record in 2002. All yield attributes of both crops exhibited significant positive relationship with grain yields, except height to the lowest pod of soyabean. TGx 1448 - 2 E and TGx 1440 - 1 E intercropped with Isaanka and Record had average grain yield of 1043 and 1081 kg ha– 1 and land equivalent ratios (LER) of 1. 47 and 1. 58, respectively. It is recommended that intercropped combination of TGx 1448 - 2 E/Isaanka and TGx 1440 - 1 E/Record be used to improve yields of vegetable oilseeds...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{impact of}} climate change on Africa {{is likely to be}} severe because of adverse direct effects, high {{agricultural}} dependence, and limited capacity to adapt. Direct effects vary widely across the continent, with some areas (e. g. eastern Africa) predicted to get wetter, but much of southern Africa getting drier and <b>hotter.</b> <b>Crop</b> yields will be adversely affected and the frequency of extreme weather events will increase. Adaptation to climate change is primarily a private-sector response and should involve relocation of people, changes in the sectoral structure of production, and changes in crop patterns. The role of government is primarily to provide the information, incentives, and economic environment to facilitate such changes. Adaptation will be impeded by Africa’s fragmentation into small countries and ethnic groups, and by poor business environments. On the mitigation side, {{there is a need to}} design emissions-trading frameworks that support greater African participation than at present, and that include land-use change.

40|$|Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) hasalready {{reached the}} 6 th or 7 th most {{produced}} food crop {{in the world}} (FAO, 2007). In Brazil sweet potato is the 4 th most consumed vegetable crop. Sweet potato is a great crop because it {{is relatively easy to}} grow, relatively free of pests and diseases, has relatively high yield, and is always a good source of carbohydrates (Miranda, 1995). Its ability to grow in poor soils makes the sweet potato an especially good crop for tropical soils where fertilizer is not easily available. Sweet potatoes can be cultivated throughout tropical and warm temperate regions wherever there is sufficient water to support their growth (Martin, 1998). Because of its drought tolerance, sweet potato is called a <b>hot</b> weather <b>crop.</b> Phuc et al.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this work}} is to provide an easy {{methodology}} for the estimation of the Net Irrigation Water Requirements (Irnet) {{to be used in}} any developing country as first step in irrigation design. Two typical <b>hot</b> climate <b>crops</b> (maize- Zea mays- and cotton- Gossypium hirsutum), cultivated in the Piracicaba area, São Paulo (Brazil) have been studied. To estimate required data, different software were utilized. FAO software (EToCalculator 3. 1 and CROPWAT 8. 0) were adopted to compute Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo), Crop Water Requirements (CWR) and Net Irrigation Water Requirements (Irnet). RAINBOW (version 2. 2) was used to examine the rainfall data from a statistical point of view {{in order to have a}} frequency analysis for the considered events. Daily climatic data for a twenty-year time period (January 1990 - December 2009) were analysed to calculate ETo. These data were obtained from the Agro-meteorological Station of ESALQ (Escola Superior de Agricultura “Luiz de Queiroz”), USP (Universidade de São Paulo), Piracicaba. Three representative years for dry, normal and humid conditions were identified out of the twenty-year time period (1991 - 1992, 2000 - 2001, and 1996 - 1997 respectively) in order to reach a more complete level of analysis. For each of the three years and with reference to the two crops under analysis, CWR and Irnet were computed. Along the three representative years, effective rainfall proved to be always higher than CWR and well distributed during maize and cotton crop cycles. As a conclusion no relevant water stress (no yield reduction) have been noticed in the CROPWAT 8. 0 outputs. It was then possible to affirm that no irrigation is needed for this kind of climate and soil conditions...|$|R

40|$|Chilli {{is one of}} the {{important}} spices and cultivated around the world for its peculiar <b>hot</b> taste. Chilli <b>crops</b> prone to affect by seedling disease called damping off. In order to overcome this problem, efforts have been made to evaluate the efficiency of the biocontrol agent Trichoderma harizanum for controlling the damping off disease in chilli. T. harizanum was isolated from the garden soil and identified through microscopic and recommended standard methods. The antagonistic activity of the T. harizanum was evaluated against the pathogenic fungi responsible for damping disease i. e., Fusarium oxysporium, Rhizoctonia solani and Alternaria alternata proved the efficiency to inhibit the growth of all the above pathogens. The T. harizanum was formulated with talcum powder and applied as foliar spray on damping off diseased chilli plants. After 49 days of treatment, T. harizanum treated chilli plants showed more plant height (75 %), number of leaves (60 %), buds (10 %) and fruits (6 %) than control. Hence we concluded that, T. harizanum can be recommended not only for the control of damping off disease in chilli plants and also to enhance the growth of the plants.

40|$|Pearl millet {{currently}} {{persists in}} extremely <b>hot</b> and dry <b>crop</b> producing {{regions of the}} world. Its expansion of usage to new areas with limited water and its response to stress conditions are of interest. Thus investigations were made as to the physiological and metabolic activity of newly developed dwarfed, hybridized pearl millets under field and growth chamber conditions. Plant responses to moisture stress and temperature stress were evaluated in regard to grain filling duration and yield components. ^ To evaluate termination of the grain filling period, radioactive assimilate translocation to maturing kernels was used to quantify physiological maturity {{in relation to the}} kernel dark layer. The use of this visual indicator was found to be rapid and effective in judging the cessation of dry weight accumulation. ^ A range of field soil moisture conditions were created by a line source sprinkler system under which three genotypes each of pearl millet and of grain sorghum were observed for moisture response reactions. Plant status and crop water use were monitored on a weekly basis during each season and water use of pearl millets appeared to be equal to that of sorghums, despite lower productivity by millets. Grain yield responses of both crops increased linearly with increased evapotranspiration but millet showed a slight decrease in water use efficiency with increased supplemental water whereas sorghum displayed an increase. Pressure chamber estimates of leaf xylem pressure potential indicated that only very small differences in readings related to large differences in grain yield. Panicle gas exchange rates of both crops were not significantly different with varying soil moisture levels but were very responsive to temperature. Respiration rates of millet panicles were 50 to 100...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{pain and}} its {{treatment}} have always posed a significant challenge {{for medical practitioners}} and many {{attempts have been made}} to reduce and eliminate it, both in past and recent history. Research to discover new effective drugs with excellent safety profiles is ongoing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of the plant Anethum graveolens (dill) for use as an analgesic drug. Forty-two mice were divided randomly into seven groups (n= 6). In the formalin test, the first group received normal saline; the second group, extract of plant seed (300 mg/kg); the third group, extract of plant crops (300 mg/kg) and the forth group received morphine (1 mg/kg). For the hot plate test, the first group received normal saline; the second group, extract of plant seed (300 mg/kg) and the third group received extract of plant crops (300 mg/kg). All injections consisted of 0. 5 ml given intraperitoneally. In the early phase of formalin test, the animals treated with seed and crop extracts did not show analgesic effects compared to control group (P= 0. 386, P= 0. 284 respectively). In contrast, in the late phase of formalin test, seed and crop extracts significantly decreased indications of pain compared to the saline group with seed extracts showing stronger analgesic effects (P= 0. 004, P= 0. 023 respectively). In the <b>hot</b> plate test, <b>crop</b> and seed extracts showed hyperalgesic properties. This effect was stronger in animals treated with crop extracts as compared to seed extracts. These findings indicate that Anethum graveolens can reduce inflammatory pain, probably by inhibiting inflammatory mediators. In contrast, this plant has no analgesic effects on spinal nociception and conversely may exacerbate it. This study provides a basis for the use of Anethum graveolens extracts in popular folk medicine, but further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanism of its analgesic actions...|$|R
40|$|All animal {{livestock}} of the South Mediterranean Countries {{suffer from}} climatic condition of mild region characterised by moist winter and <b>hot</b> dry summer. <b>Crop</b> {{resources in the}} majority of the countries cannot cover the animal need, so farmer has two solutions feeding his flock under than necessary with effects on yield of production or adding in the animal ration a concentrate with high energy value but this is costly. Also the majority of small ruminants breeds in Mediterranean countries are local breeds which are well adapted to the local conditions but with low level of production. For this reasons organic animal production appears the most suited solution to solve these problems because organic agriculture with its specific techniques uses less quantities of inputs (minimum of concentrated aliments) and valorises pasture resources with good management of grazing. As to organic production it is preferable to have local animal breed, the most important criterion is the quality of the product and not the quantity. Consumers start now to give more importance to quality of meat consumed because of the problems of BSE, toxins and brucellosis. They aim at healthy products with traceability and without any use of OGM crops or animal powder in animal ration. This condition can be easily realised with organic techniques. Many Mediterranean countries like Tunisia start to make policies supporting the organic agriculture sector and write their own regulation based on IFOAM Basic Guidelines and EU-Regulation. In Tunisia legislation for organic animal production is in preparation now and must be effective before the end of 2001 but the analysis of draft standards shows that there is a copy of UE-Regulation 2092 / 91 for animal production. This legislation may present some problems in terms of application because of the wide differences between European conditions and Tunisian conditions, for instance techniques of flock conduct are different because of the climatic conditions, traditional farm habits and nature of animal breed. Other problems for Mediterranean countries concern the lack of local markets for organic meat, so all the production is for exportation towards European market and here it seems impossible to export living animal because of European restriction in terms of processing. In the case of Tunisia there is no slaughterhouse which respond to international standards that’s why nowadays southern Mediterranean countries cannot export their meat (organic or conventional) towards developed countries. The only solution is to develop local market and to have at international level slaughterhouses, means of storage and meat processing. ...|$|R
