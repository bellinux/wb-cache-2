40|$|In recent years, British labour {{markets have}} been characterised by {{a decline of}} {{institutional}} regulation of entry routes into many occupations and internal labour markets. This paper examines this change by comparing occupational labour markets for selected occupations in which institutional regulation has remained largely intact with those in which entry has become more fluid. It argues that in the latter case, structured entry paths, which were characterised by competition at the ports of entry, {{have given way to}} <b>extended</b> <b>entry</b> tournaments in which competition is spread over a much longer time period. Using data from the New Earnings Survey panel for 1975 - 2001, it relates the comparatively greater growth in earnings inequality in these occupations to the emergence of <b>extended</b> <b>entry</b> tournaments. As pay at the top has risen, greater competition for entry at the bottom has held down pay and depressed conditions. It argues that many of the aspirant members of these occupations compete for entry for too long, and then become trapped as it is too late to change occupation.

The major focus of internationalization literature has been foreign market entries, with the discussion of market selection (e.g., Anderson 1997; Johanson & Vahlne 1977).

40|$|Studies of {{submicron}} dust using Mie scattering from Nd:YAG lasers {{and video}} data of micron to sub-millimeter sized dust on DIII-D tokamak {{have provided the}} first data of dust sources and transport during tokamak discharges. During normal operation on DIII-D dust observation rates are low, a few events per discharge or less. The net carbon content of the dust corresponds to a carbon atom density a few orders of magnitude below the core impurity density. Statistical analysis of Mie data collected over months of operation reveal correlation of increased dust rate with increased heating power and impulsive wall loading due to edge localized modes (ELMs) and disruptions. Generation of significant amounts of dust by disruptions is confirmed by the camera data. However, dust production by disruptions alone is insufficient to account for estimated in-vessel dust inventory in DIII-D. After an <b>extended</b> <b>entry</b> vent, thousands of dust particles are observed by cameras in the first 2 - 3 plasma discharges. Individual particles moving at velocities up to {approx} 300 m/s, breakup of larger particles into pieces, and collisions of particles with walls are observed. After {approx} 70 discharges, dust levels are reduced to a few events per discharge. In order to calibrate diagnostics and benchmark modeling, milligram amounts of micron-sized carbon dust have been injected into DIII-D discharges, leading to the core carbon density increase {{by a factor of}} 2 - 3. Following injection, dust trajectories in the divertor are mostly in the toroidal direction, consistent with the ion drag force. Dust from the injection is observed in the outboard midplane by a fast framing camera. The observed trajectories and velocities of the dust particles are in qualitative agreement with modeling by the 3 D DustT code...|$|E

The thesis examines {{the significance of the}} archive, and of the role of archiving. as part of Chadwick's self-critical art practice, and in the historical construction of the artist Helen Chadwick, in now being available as a research resource. Analytical readings of two early works provide an example of how the archive can be used in writing a history of Chadwick's practice and how it opens different ways of knowing the artist. The studies of the installations Domestic Sanitation (1973 ~ 76) and Ego Geometria Sum (1982 ~ 84) reveal the evolution of self-reflexive, Research-led practices that extend the concept of a finite artwork. Chadwick's focus on the body and the politics of embodiment are explored through analysis of preparatory material, intermediary works and her documentation of performative practices in the process of researching and creating the works. The final staging of the works as complex installations is also examined in detail. The catalogue raisonne in volume two provides a fully researched chronological timeline of Chadwick's oeuvre with two <b>extended</b> <b>entries</b> or 'dossiers' relating to the works featured in the case studies. These chart the evolution of each project, through the. presentation of archive material in order to further illuminate the processes of research and realisationEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
