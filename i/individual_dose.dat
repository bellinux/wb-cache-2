5|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{established}} its Yucca Mountain {{standards in}} June 2001. The storage standard set a dose limit of 15 millirem {{per year for}} the public outside the Yucca Mountain site. The disposal standards consisted of three components: an <b>individual</b> <b>dose</b> standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository, and a groundwater protection standard. The individual-protection and human intrusion standards {{set a limit of}} 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would be among the most highly exposed members of the public. The groundwater protection standard is consistent with EPA's Safe Drinking Water Act standards, which the Agency applies in many situations as a pollution prevention measure. The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE's Environmental Impact Statement, but were not subject to a compliance standard. The 10,000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA's generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. It also reflects international guidance regarding the level of confidence that can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time.|$|E

5000|$|In {{accordance}} with current knowledge of radiation health risks, the Health Physics Society recommends against quantitative estimation of health risks below an <b>individual</b> <b>dose</b> of 5 rem (50 mSv) {{in one year}} or a lifetime dose of 10 rem (100 mSv) above that received from natural sources. Doses from natural background radiation in the United States average about 0.3 rem (3 mSv) per year. A dose of 5 rem (50 mSv) will be accumulated in the first 17 years of life and about 25 rem (250 mSv) in a lifetime of 80 years. Estimation of health risk associated with radiation doses that are of similar magnitude as those received from natural sources should be strictly qualitative and encompass a range of hypothetical health outcomes, including the possibility of no adverse health effects at such low levels.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the largest}} mass {{applications}} of <b>individual</b> <b>dose</b> reconstruction principles is also being undertaken by NIOSH.

The program is administered by the Department of Labor. NIOSH’s responsibility under the Act is to determine the probability that an individual’s cancer was a result of their occupational radiation exposure at a DOE or AWE facility. This probability is determined by DOL and is based on the radiation dose reconstruction completed by NIOSH. The dose reconstructions are completed by individuals trained in the field of health physics.|$|E

40|$|Background: The paper {{presents}} the Nofer Institutes of Occupational Medicine in Łódź's {{results of the}} assessment of <b>individual</b> <b>dose</b> equivalents Hp(0. 07) of medical staff exposed to X-rays in Poland in 2012. In addition, the collected data was analysed in terms of types of medical units performing medical procedures and the categorization of personnel. Material and Methods: Dosimetric service was provided for medical staff of interventional radiology departments occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation in terms of <b>individual</b> <b>dose</b> equivalents Hp(0. 07). In 2012, personal dosimetry Hp(0. 07) determinations were performed by the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine in Łódź and covered 2044 employees from 174 health facilities. The determinations were performed using thermoluminescence dosimetry according to the procedure accredited by the Polish Centre for Accreditation (document number AB 327). The measurements were performed using ring-dosimeters in the periods of 1 or 2 months. Results: Mean annual <b>individual</b> <b>dose</b> equivalent Hp(0. 07) in 2012 was equal to 3. 3 mSv (annual limit for Hp(0. 07) is 500 mSv). The average value of annual <b>individual</b> <b>dose</b> equivalent Hp(0. 07) decreased comparing to the previous year. In 2012, no single case of exceeding the annual limit for Hp(0. 07) was reported. Data stored in the file indicates that more than 96 % {{of all of the}} annual doses did not exceed the level of 10 mSv. Conclusions: The analysis of data on occupational exposure to ionizing radiation confirms a stable level of exposure and satisfactory radiological protection in interventional radiology facilities monitored by the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine in Łódź in Poland in 2012.

40|$|The {{accident}} at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant on March 11, 2011, released radioactive material {{into the atmosphere}} and contaminated the land in Fukushima and several neighboring prefectures. Five years after the nuclear disaster, the radiation levels have greatly decreased due to physical decay, weathering, and decontamination operations in Fukushima. The populations of 12 communities were forced to evacuate after the accident; as of March 2016, the evacuation order has been lifted in only a limited area, and permanent habitation is still prohibited {{in most of the}} areas. In order for the government to lift the evacuation order and for individuals to return to their original residential areas, it is important to assess current and future realistic <b>individual</b> external <b>doses.</b> Here, we used personal dosimeters along with the Global Positioning System and Geographic Information System to understand realistic <b>individual</b> external <b>doses</b> and to relate <b>individual</b> external <b>doses,</b> ambient doses, and activity-patterns of individuals in the affected areas in Fukushima. The results showed that the additional <b>individual</b> external <b>doses</b> were well correlated to the additional ambient doses based on the airborne monitoring survey. The results of linear regression analysis suggested that the additional <b>individual</b> external <b>doses</b> were on average about one-fifth that of the additional ambient doses. The reduction factors, which are defined as the ratios of the additional <b>individual</b> external <b>doses</b> to the additional ambient doses, were calculated to be on average 0. 14 and 0. 32 for time spent at home and outdoors, respectively. Analysis of the contribution of various activity patterns to the total <b>individual</b> external <b>dose</b> demonstrated good agreement with the average fraction of time spent daily in each activity, but the contribution due to being outdoors varied widely.

A system of reporting and authorization for such releases is now under development in the Netherlands. An activity is entered into the system when the maximum <b>individual</b> <b>dose</b> or collective dose due to releases to air or water exceeds a certain value: the so-called basic dose criteria.
