40|$|The use of <b>flame</b> <b>photometers</b> {{has greatly}} {{simplified}} and expedited {{the estimation of}} sodium and potassium. Calcium {{is one of the}} elements which it is possible to determine by flame photo-metry, but little advantage has been taken of this fact in biological work for a number of reasons. The concentration of calcium in extracellular fluids is usually less than that of potassium; a given quantity of calcium in a coal gas-air or butane-air flame emits much less light than an equivalent quantity of potassium, and the emission is more readily interfered with by the presence of other ions than is that produced by either sodium or potassium. <b>Flame</b> <b>photometers</b> differ in th...|$|R

(1) and Nelson and Cohen (2) {{found that}} {{erythrocyte}} lithium con-centration and erythrocyte/plasma lithium ratio {{may be of}} greater diag-nostic significance than is serum lithium concentration. Lyttkens et al.

Our own clinical results are in harmony with this inter-pretation. Hisayasa et al. (4) proposed that atomic absorption spectrophotometry without internal standards be used for such analyses. Unfortunately, their use of a relatively hot (2600 K) air/acetylene flame and the lack of an ionization buffer and internal standards decrease the general usefulness of their proce-dure.

30|$|A {{total of}} 23 {{groundwater}} samples, namely, monitoring, domestic and hand dug wells from five districts were sampled. The sampling campaign {{was carried out}} in the dry season, in the months of October and November, 2013. In sampling from boreholes with hand pumps, purging was done for a minimum of 10  min to flush stagnant water retained in the pipes. In the case of hand dug wells, it was properly checked and confirmed that the well was being used daily. This was to ensure that stale and stagnant water was not sampled. All the water samples were collected in 250  mL preconditioned high-density polyethylene bottles. The bottles were conditioned by washing with 5  % nitric acid, and then rinsed several times with distilled water. This was carried out to ensure that the sampling bottles were free from contaminants. Temperature, electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solids (TDS) measurements were conducted in situ in the field by the HACH conductivity and pH meter.

40|$|Flame {{photometry}} is {{a method}} {{that is used to}} determine the concentration of ions in an aqueous solution. In daily life, this machine is mostly used in biochemistry, to determine various concentrations of ions in aqueous solution. However this method is not precise as other methods in analytical chemistry. In this study, the aim was to find out how effectively does <b>flame</b> <b>photometer</b> measures the concentration of ions in aqueous solutions. An experiment was carried out by using Na+ ions. Concentrations ranging from 1 to 25 ppm (mg/L) were used because below and upper levels does not give precise results. For the beginning of the experiment, standard solutions with known sodium ion concentration were prepared for the <b>flame</b> <b>photometer.</b> So a calibration curve was drawn showing the relationship between the concentration and emission in <b>flame</b> <b>photometer.</b> In this experiment, concentrations between 10 ppm to 25 ppm broke the linearity of the calibration curve, so standard solutions between 1 to 10 ppm were prepared. The calibration curve was linear at this time so water samples can be analysed. Some water samples were analysed. The results were mixed. Some results were close to the original value. However some results were really distant from their actual values. This shows the inaccuracy of the <b>flame</b> <b>photometer.</b> To conclude, this experiment showed that <b>flame</b> <b>photometer</b> is not a reliable method to measure concentration of ions in aqueous solutions...|$|E
