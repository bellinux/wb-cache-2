5|$|Lesser Roman Catholic prelates use {{a variety}} of colors. Violet hats were once {{actually}} worn by certain monsignors, and so in heraldry they have used a violet hat with red or violet tassels in varying numbers, currently fixed at six on <b>each</b> <b>side.</b> The lowest grade of monsignor, a Chaplain of His Holiness, uses a black hat with violet tassels. The superior general of an order displays a black galero with six tassels on <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> while provincial superiors and abbots use a black galero with six or three tassels on <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> although Norbertines (White Canons) use a white galero. Although a priest would rarely assume arms unless he had an ancestral right to arms independent of his clerical state, a priest would use a simple black ecclesiastical hat with a single tassel on <b>each</b> <b>side.</b> Priests who hold an office such as rector would have two tassels on <b>each</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{total area}} of the complex is 30,958m2, while the {{area of the}} arena is 10,964m2. Its height in the middle is 24m.

The corridor around the arena is divided into two symmetrical parts with 15 entrances on <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> including 30 outside entrances. Each sector has 2 transport access points (1 on <b>each</b> <b>side),</b> 10 arena entrances (5 on <b>each</b> <b>side)</b> and 16 tribune access points (8 on <b>each</b> <b>side).</b> Along the corridor, there are 10 beverage facilities (5 in each sector), 18 catering facilities (9 in each sector), 2 first aid points (1 in each sector), 36 toilets (6 for men, 6 for women and 6 for persons with physical disabilities in each sector).

5|$|As well as {{the main}} scoreboard, the {{ballpark}} has three more LED displays. A display in the left-center field wall is used for showing player introductions, in-game pitching statistics, upcoming batters, and advertisements. LED ribbon boards are installed on the facings of <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the upper deck; these are used to display the inning, score, count, player introductions, and advertisements. The stadium's three pitch clocks—part of professional baseball's pace-of-game initiatives implemented in Triple-A and Double-A baseball games in 2015— are located on the straightaway center field wall and on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the backstop.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multi-layered case representation {{for addressing the}} problem of comparing and indexing cases in a case-based reasoning system using both {{the facts and the}} underlying themes associated with those cases. In many domains, experts discuss problems in terms of multiple layers of abstract principles, classifying problems by conflicts, strategies, or themes important to the domain. For example, when lawyers compare cases, they compare the facts, <b>each</b> <b>side’s</b> interpretation of the facts, <b>each</b> <b>side’s</b> arguments, and disagreements about those arguments.

Both captains declined the opportunity to fight in water not of their own choosing; Jeffers in particular was under positive orders not to risk his ship. Consequently, each vessel spent the next month in what amounted to posturing. Not only did the two ships not fight each other, neither ship ever fought again after March 9.|$|E

Loading and unloading of passengers was accomplished via wide doors positioned on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> {{at the center of the}} cars with built-in trap doors and steps.

5|$|On {{the five}} pendentives along <b>each</b> <b>side</b> {{and the two}} at either end, Michelangelo painted the largest figures on the ceiling: twelve people who prophesied or {{represented}} {{some aspect of the}} Coming of Christ. Of those twelve, seven were Prophets of Israel and were male. The remaining five were prophets of the Classical World, called Sibyls and were female. The prophet Jonah is placed above the altar and Zechariah at the further end. The other male and female figures alternate down <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> each being identified by an inscription on a painted marble panel supported by a putto.|$|E

The current composition, with the symbols of the Evangelists duplicated on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the hilt, matches that known from the earliest preserved depiction drafted by Johann Christoph Werner in 1794. It is possible, though, that the original placement of the golden plates was different, with the symbols of Saints John and Matthew on the obverse of the grip, so that <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the hilt displayed the symbols of {{all four of the}} Evangelists.|$|E
