2500|$|The [...] {{furnishings}} of the Contessa 32 cabin {{are typical}} of boats of her size and vintage. There is a V-shaped berth in the bow, followed by a small head (toilet) to port opposite a wet-locker and shower. The saloon (main cabin area) includes a folding table, with sofas that double as berths, the table lowering to convert the port berth to a double. At the aft end of the saloon next to the companionway, and to port, is a small U-shaped galley, consisting of a stove, sink (fed by an 18-gallon freshwater tank), and a counter. To starboard, there is a chart table, with a quarter berth extending aft of the navigators seat. An inboard marine diesel engine of 15 to 25 horsepower is mounted beneath the cockpit, fed by a 12-gallon fuel tank. Modern boats have a Beta Marine 20 or 25 horsepower engine with folding or feathering propellor, in conventional or <b>hybrid</b> <b>configuration.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Insight’s IMA {{includes}} a high-efficiency, lightweight, low-friction 1.3-liter SOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine rated for [...] at 5800 rpm and [...] of torque from 1000–1700 rpm. The high torque at low rpm {{is made possible}} by the electric motor which contributes up to [...] at 1500 rpm and [...] of torque at 1000 rpm to the powertrain, assisting in acceleration and some steady state cruising situations at low-to-mid vehicle speeds. The motor acts as a generator during braking, steady cruising, gentle deceleration and coasting in order to recharge the IMA battery. The motor also serves as the engine starter, quickly spinning the engine to idle speed after Idle Stop and during normal vehicle starting. The system will automatically switch to a back-up, conventional 12-volt starter to start the engine if the IMA system is disabled or if the car is started at extreme cold temperatures. As an additional safety feature, Honda’s <b>hybrid</b> <b>configuration</b> allows the car to operate like a conventional, petrol-engine vehicle even if the IMA hybrid-electric motor system is completely disabled.|$|E

40|$|We {{perform a}} {{systematic}} study of <b>hybrid</b> star <b>configurations</b> using several parametrizations of a relativistic mean-field hadronic EoS and the NJL model for three-flavor quark matter. For the hadronic phase {{we use the}} stiff GM 1 and TM 1 parametrizations, {{as well as the}} very stiff NL 3 model. In the NJL Lagrangian we include scalar, vector and 't Hooft interactions. The vector coupling constant g_v is treated as a free parameter. We also consider that there is a split between the deconfinement and the chiral phase transitions which is controlled by changing the conventional value of the vacuum pressure - Ω_ 0 in the NJL thermodynamic potential by - (Ω_ 0 + δΩ_ 0), being δΩ_ 0 a free parameter. We find that, as we increase the value of δΩ_ 0, hybrid stars have a larger maximum mass but are less stable, i. e. <b>hybrid</b> <b>configurations</b> are stable within a smaller range of central densities. For large enough δΩ_ 0, stable <b>hybrid</b> <b>configurations</b> are not possible at all. The effect of increasing the coupling constant g_v is very similar. We show that stable <b>hybrid</b> <b>configurations</b> with a maximum mass larger than the observed mass of the pulsar PSR J 1614 - 2230 are possible for a large region of the parameter space of g_v and δΩ_ 0 provided the hadronic equation of state contains nucleons only. When the baryon octet is included in the hadronic phase, only a very small region of the parameter space allows to explain the mass of PSR J 1614 - 2230. We compare our results with previous calculations of hybrid stars within the NJL model. We show {{that it is possible to}} obtain stable <b>hybrid</b> <b>configurations</b> also in the case δΩ_ 0 = 0 that corresponds to the conventional NJL model for which the pressure and density vanish at zero temperature and chemical potential.

40|$|Copyright © 2006 SAE International A fuel-cycle model—called the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model—has been {{developed}} at Argonne National Laboratory to evaluate well-to-wheels (WTW) energy and emission impacts of motor vehicle technologies fueled with various transportation fuels. The new GREET version has up-to-date information regarding energy use and emissions for fuel production activities and vehicle operations. In this study, a complete WTW evaluation targeting energy use, greenhouse gases (CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O), and typical criteria air pollutants (VOC, NOX and PM 10) {{includes the following}} fuel options – gasoline, diesel and hydrogen; and the following vehicle technologies – spark-ignition engines with or without <b>hybrid</b> <b>configurations,</b> compression-ignition engines with <b>hybrid</b> <b>configurations,</b> and hydrogen fuel cells with <b>hybrid</b> <b>configurations.</b> Based on the detailed up-to-date data, probability-based distribution functions for key input parameters regarding WTP activities and vehicle operations were built into GREET to address the uncertainties of energy use and emissions.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 Fuel cell/gas turbine hybrids show {{promise of}} high {{efficiency}} power generation, with electrical efficiencies of 70 % or better shown by modeling, although these efficiency levels {{have not yet}} been demonstrated in hardware. Modeling of such systems is important to optimize and control these complex systems. This work describes a modeling tool developed to examine steady-state operation of different <b>hybrid</b> <b>configurations.</b> This model focuses on the area of compressor-turbine modeling, which is a key component of properly controlling fuel cell/gas turbine hybrids. Through side-by-side comparisons, this model has been tested and verified by Dr. Wolf of Brayton Energy [1]. This modeling tool will be used in further work to evaluate various configurations of turbines and fuel cells in <b>hybrid</b> <b>configurations,</b> focusing on both the performance and cost of such systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} performance of graphical dot arrays designed to make discrimination of relative numerosity as effortless as possible {{at the same time}} as making absolute (quantitative) numerosity estimation as effortful as possible. Comparing regular, random, and <b>hybrid</b> (randomized regular) <b>configurations</b> of dots, the results indicate that both random and <b>hybrid</b> <b>configurations</b> reduce absolute numerosity estimation precision, when compared with regular dots arrays. However, discrimination of relative numerosity is significantly more accurate for hybrid dot arrays than for random dot arrays. Similarly, human subjects report significantly lower levels of subjective confidence in judgments when using <b>hybrid</b> dot <b>configurations</b> as compared with regular configurations; and significantly higher levels of subjective confidence as compared with random configurations. These results indicate that data graphics based on the <b>hybrid,</b> randomized-regular <b>configurations</b> of dots are well-suited to applications that require decisions to be based on numerical data in which the absolute quantities are less certain than the relative values. Examples of such applications include decision-making based on the outputs of empirically- based mathematical models, such as health-related policy decisions using data from predictive epidemiological models...|$|R
