During the 30's and 40's only beer of 2.8% alcohol by volume had been brewed - pilsner. It was now time to develop a <b>stronger</b> <b>beer.</b> As the first brewery in Sweden, Krönleins began to produce a high grade <b>strong</b> <b>beer</b> {{in the beginning of the}} 50's. The beer was given the name Three Hearts Export. In the beginning the <b>strong</b> <b>beer</b> was made solely for export, since beer of this strength was prohibited in Sweden at the time.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first known}} {{use of the}} word stout for beer was in a {{document}} dated 1677 found in the Egerton Manuscript, the sense being that a stout <b>beer</b> was a <b>strong</b> <b>beer</b> not a dark beer. [...] The name porter was first used in 1721 to describe a dark brown beer that had been made with roasted malts. Because of the huge popularity of porters, brewers made them in a variety of strengths. The <b>stronger</b> <b>beers</b> were called [...] "stout porters", so the history and development of stout and porter are intertwined, and the term stout has become firmly associated with dark beer, rather than just <b>strong</b> <b>beer.</b>|$|R
