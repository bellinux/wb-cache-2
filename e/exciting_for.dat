5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very <b>exciting</b> <b>for</b> me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
5|$|Rare co-founder Tim Stamper {{conceptualized}} a gardening {{game for}} the handheld Pocket PC platform in 2002. A three-person team began work on a simple prototype while the company was still affiliated with Nintendo, prior to its Microsoft acquisition. Development transferred to the original Xbox and, ultimately, to the Xbox 360 for its enhanced graphical capabilities. The development team wanted its animals to have a unified style, which was how the concept artist arrived at the piñata conceit. The idea was <b>exciting</b> <b>for</b> the team, as piñatas were not commonplace in the United Kingdom. The connection between piñatas and candy-filled insides led to new gameplay directions.|$|E
500|$|More <b>exciting</b> <b>for</b> {{planetary}} astronomers {{was that}} the best orbital calculations suggested that the comet would pass within [...] {{of the center of}} Jupiter, a distance smaller than the planet's radius, meaning that there was an extremely high probability that SL9 would collide with Jupiter in July 1994. Studies suggested that the train of nuclei would plow into Jupiter's atmosphere over a period of about five days.|$|E

500|$|Bleecker's {{writing was}} <b>exciting</b> <b>for</b> the time, and {{her sense of}} style added {{dimension}} to {{a new type of}} novel, the didactic novel. Her expression was influenced by the [...] "eighteenth-century British cult of sensibility". She wrote in a mannered, and often exaggerated way, to express her moral lesson. In addition, she used the epistolic literary device, structuring the story as a series of letters to her half-sister, Susan Ten Eyck, in which she interrupted the narrative to comment on the action and address Susan directly.|$|E
500|$|Writer Rob Edwards {{stated that}} [...] "it was {{extremely}} challenging" [...] {{to take a}} classic novel and set it in outer space, and that they did away {{with some of the}} science fiction elements ("things like the metal space ships and the coldness") early on. Edwards {{goes on to say that}} they [...] "did a lot of things to make the film more modern" [...] and that the idea behind setting the film in outer space was to [...] "make the story as <b>exciting</b> <b>for</b> kids now as the book was for kids then".|$|E

500|$|However, Johar {{maintained}} that the new film would belong to a different milieu {{as compared to the}} original. He stated, [...] "We are adapting the film from the original but ours would be a new age version that would fit in well with today's time. We really hope that we are able to do justice to the original and make the remake <b>exciting</b> <b>for</b> today's generation." [...] In an interview with Filmfare, he added that the protagonist of the film would be [...] "more of an underdog", while the antagonist would be [...] "more flamboyant and menacing" [...] than the older version.|$|E
500|$|Avnet and Conran {{spent two}} years working on the screenplay, which {{included}} numerous genre-related references and homages, and developing a working relationship. Then, the producer took the script and the trailer and began approaching actors. In order to protect Conran's vision, Avnet decided to shoot the movie independently {{with a lot of}} his own money. The producer realized that [...] "the very thing that made this film potentially so <b>exciting</b> <b>for</b> me, and I think for an audience, which was the personal nature of it and the singularity of the vision, would never succeed and never survive the development process within a studio." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} was generally positive. The pilot was found comparable in quality to Smallville, with suggestions that Aquaman was indeed {{worthy of a}} place on The CW's schedule. The cast was well received; in addition, Hartley was praised for his portrayal of Arthur Curry. Cinematography and underwater special effects were well received. Reviews that were not as positive did concede the show had potential. The project was commended for keeping the comic book myth fresh and <b>exciting</b> <b>for</b> a modern audience. IGN had a different opinion of the show, calling it [...] "dead in the water", and comparing it to [...] "cheesy cult classics, such as Shazam!".|$|E

500|$|The {{inverted}} roller coaster, then dubbed [...] "Secret Weapon 3", {{was developed}} throughout 1992. Wardley and Nick Varney, marketing director of Alton Towers, {{came up with}} the name [...] "Nemesis" [...] and pitched a theming concept about an alien creature excavated from the ground. Tussauds Studios elaborated on this, creating the station and surrounding theme design. Wardley also worked alongside Stengel Engineering and landscape architects to develop a layout for the ride and surrounding area, which could be <b>exciting</b> <b>for</b> both riders and non-riders; for example, the final inversion was built at the eye level of an observer and the queue makes its way {{all the way around the}} quarry in which the track sits.|$|E
500|$|Computer and Video Games's (CVG) {{deputy editor}} Andy Robinson told TechRadar that the [...] "4S is {{certainly}} laying down some serious credibility for the iPhone as a core gaming device. Not {{only is it}} now pushing out games that simply eclipse the 3DS visually, but features like cloud saving and TV streaming support are really <b>exciting</b> <b>for</b> gamers." [...] The senior gaming analyst at Jon Peddie Research, Ted Pollak, believes the biggest improvement to gaming on the [...] is the voice control features, noting that [...] "one of the features that Nintendogs players loved was the ability to talk to it. There's no reason why a game like that couldn't {{be done on the}} , and much more sophisticated given the voice control shown." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hello Kitty" [...] is a J-pop, dubstep, and EDM {{track that}} is three minutes and {{eighteen}} seconds long. [...] "Hello Kitty" [...] {{was written by}} Lavigne, Chad Kroeger, David Hodges and Martin Johnson, while the song was produced by Kroeger and Hodges. Brandon Paddock and Kyle Moorman became assistants in its production. The song was engineered by John Hanes, musical mixed by Serban Ghenea and additional programming was held by Paddock and Moorman. Lavigne described the lyrics while talking to Digital Spy, [...] "'Hello Kitty' was such an interesting topic and subject [...] It was really <b>exciting</b> <b>for</b> me.

500|$|... "Bound" [...] {{was written}} by co-creators J.J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci, and {{executive}} producer Jeff Pinkner. Producer Frederick E. O. Toye worked as the director. For Olivia's spinal tap scene, Toye attempted to create a [...] "creepy and weird" [...] atmosphere. He explained, [...] "She's strapped down, she's in a gurney. They're going to pull fluid out of her spine. It's creepy and weird. That's what we're going for, to try and set it up as a really awkward, horrible environment to be trapped in." [...] Toye and the crew {{wanted to make it}} [...] "as visually interesting and dramatic as possible," [...] and added in dripping water and [...] "creepy" [...] lighting to emphasize Olivia's [...] "terrible circumstances." [...] First assistant director Gary Rake noted that the episode [...] "took the character Olivia to a higher level... She's a lot more active, which is very <b>exciting</b> <b>for</b> us." ...|$|E
500|$|Rihanna later {{described}} the sentiment {{she wanted to}} express as [...] "gangsta", and elaborated on how reggae culture has influenced her musical style: [...] "I'm super inspired by reggae music [...] {{has been a part}} of me since I was born, and I grew up listening to it. I was <b>exciting</b> <b>for</b> me to take this on as my own and do a song like this, especially with the lyrics being like that." [...] The track was composed during Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth tour. The song's instrumental was recorded by Cary Clark at The Village in Los Angeles.

500|$|With {{regard to}} Chuck and Blair, Meester stated, [...] "I can really relate to it—not {{necessarily}} because it's this dramatic, tumultuous relationship, {{but because the}} way they love each other is very real, {{and not for the}} sake of being dramatic. It's actual love. There's nobody for each other but them." [...] Meester also expressed fondness for Dan and Blair, however, stating, [...] "I think they're good for each other in a lot of ways, in a way that Chuck and Blair aren't." [...] Badgley claimed that he thought [...] "Blair [...] Dan’s soul mate" [...] and further stated that he thought the Blair and Dan storyline was [...] "the most <b>exciting</b> <b>for</b> Dan as a person". When Hollywoodlife.com asked Ed Westwick, who played Chuck Bass, which character he thought loved Blair more, Chuck or Dan, Westwick pointed to Badgley, saying [...] "definitely him." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{increased}} hostilities between North Korea and South Korea in {{the wake}} of the sinking of the South Korean corvette [...] in March 2010, Formula One Group chief executive Bernie Ecclestone had said the race would be in jeopardy if political tensions continued to escalate, and it would be abandoned if the North Korean army crossed the border. The revival of the French Grand Prix at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours was mooted as an alternative if the Korean Grand Prix was cancelled. Although hostilities between the two nations eventually relaxed, the race was further threatened by delayed construction. On 27 September 2010, Ecclestone said he doubted the circuit would be ready despite the tarmac having been laid. A final inspection of the circuit took place on 11 October; Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) safety delegate Charlie Whiting certified that the circuit was ready on 12 October. The top layer of the track was completed ten days before the race; there was not enough time for the elements to remove the oils and bitumen chemicals in the tarmac. Circuit designer Hermann Tilke said the surface would be slippery, making the race challenging for drivers and <b>exciting</b> <b>for</b> fans.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the end of}} , {{which had}} been used to launch UPN, they were seeking a new Star Trek series. The network {{contacted}} Rick Berman during the [...] of , and informed him that if he didn't develop a new Star Trek show then they would find someone else who would. Berman had previously been an executive producer on Voyager, and other series dating back to The Next Generation. Berman contacted Brannon Braga, and the two became the executive producers on the new show. The new series launched after the end of Voyager, but was set some 150 years before the events seen in The Original Series. The new series was originally called Enterprise, without the Star Trek prefix. UPN president Dean Valentine said that [...] "Paramount felt it was no longer necessary. Enterprise is synonymous with Star Trek". Berman's idea was to set it in an earlier time period, with limited technology such as the ship only being able to travel up to warp 5, as he felt that after three series being set in roughly the same time period it would be <b>exciting</b> <b>for</b> the fans.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hae, Bell," [...] said Sanders, {{handing the}} bag to Bell in an off-hand way {{as if it}} were but a trifle. Nevertheless he was a little <b>excited,</b> <b>for</b> he went off without saying good-night.|$|R
