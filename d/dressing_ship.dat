60|$|Tuesday.--The wild {{round of}} gaiety continues. After I {{had written to}} you yesterday, the brain being wholly extinct, I played piquet all morning with Graham. After lunch down to call on the U.S. consul, hurt in a steeplechase; thence back to the new girls' school which Lady J. was to open, and where my ladies met me. Lady J. is really an orator, with a voice of gold; {{the rest of us}} played our unremarked parts; missionaries, Haggard, myself, a Samoan chief, holding forth in turn; myself with (at least) a golden brevity. Thence, Fanny, Belle, and I to town, to our billiard room in Haggard's back garden, where we found Lloyd and where Graham joined us. The three men first dressed, with the ladies in a corner; and then, to leave them a free field, we went off to Haggard and Leigh's quarters, whereafter all to dinner, where our two parties, a brother of Colonel Kitchener's, a passing globe-trotter, and Clarke the missionary. A very gay evening, with all sorts of chaff and mirth, and a moonlit ride home, and to bed before 12.30. And now to-day, we have the Jersey-Haggard troupe to lunch, and I must pass the morning <b>dressing</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E

50|$|The town of Sandwich has {{an annual}} festival period {{towards the end}} of August when a number of events are staged. During Sandwich festivals of the past there have been European markets, {{motorcycle}} meets, an illuminated boat parade or <b>dressed</b> <b>ship</b> parade on The Quay, a street Barn Dance, various concerts (both classical and modern pop/rock), Simultaneous Chess Tournament with Grand Master John Emms and a vintage Car Show. The festival usually lasts for 8 days.|$|R

50|$|Given the {{classification}} of SP-765 (or Id.No. 765 in some sources), Adelante was commissioned at Lawley's Shipyard, Neponset, Massachusetts, on 17 December 1918, Lt. Edwin W. Keith, USNRF, in command. After fitting out alongside Battery Wharf, and at the Section Base, Boston, through mid-February 1919, Adelante <b>dressed</b> <b>ship</b> on 24 February {{in honor of the}} arrival in Boston of President Woodrow Wilson on board the transport George Washington, and stood out as part of the veritable armada of ships which proceeded to greet the returning Chief Executive as his ship arrived, appropriately enough, in President Roads.|$|R

5000|$|The {{spring of}} that year brought Ashuelot one of her more {{interesting}} assignments. On 30 April, the steamer Irrawaddy — with General Ulysses S. Grant and party on board — entered Hong Kong harbor. After leaving the White House some two years earlier, the former President had begun a cruise around the world; and he wished to visit China and Japan before heading home. Ashuelot <b>dressed</b> <b>ship</b> and manned the yards in honor of her erstwhile Commander in Chief. A short time later, Grant briefly visited the gunboat which {{had been charged with}} transporting him while he was in Chinese waters. He returned to her on 5 May and she took him to Canton and Macao. She returned to Hong Kong on the 10th, and he went ashore for two final days at that British crown colony.|$|R
50|$|Albemarle {{remained}} at Philadelphia, fitting out, through mid-January 1941. Underway for Newport, Rhode Island {{on the morning}} of 28 January, the seaplane tender arrived at her destination on the 30th, and loaded torpedoes. She sailed the following day for Norfolk, Virginia, arriving on 1 February and, over the ensuing days, remained in that area, loading bombs and pyrotechnics and calibrating her degaussing gear, before she sailed on her shakedown cruise on the afternoon of 6 February, setting course for Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. The seaplane tender shifted thence to Havana {{on the morning of}} 18 February, and over the days which followed her captain made the usual formal calls dictated by diplomatic protocol. In Havana harbor, Albemarle <b>dressed</b> <b>ship</b> for Washington's Birthday, her 21-gun salute to the American national holiday returned gun-for-gun by the Cuban gunboat Yarn. On the morning of 24 February, the ship got underway for the Panama Canal Zone.|$|R
60|$|From 8 till 11.15 on Tuesday, I <b>dressed</b> <b>ship,</b> and in {{particular}} cleaned crystal, my specialty. About 11.30 the guests began to arrive before I was dressed, and between while I had written a parody for Lloyd to sing. Yesterday, Wednesday, I had to start out about 3 for town, had a long interview {{with the head of}} the German Firm about some work in my new house, got over to Lloyd's billiard-room about six, on the way whither I met Fanny and Belle coming down with one Kitchener, a brother of the Colonel's. Dined in the billiard-room, discovered we had forgot to order oatmeal; whereupon in the moonlit evening, I set forth in my tropical array, mess jacket and such, to get the oatmeal, and meet a young fellow C.--and not a bad young fellow either, only an idiot--as drunk as Croesus. He wept with me, he wept for me; he talked like a bad character in an impudently bad farce; I could have laughed aloud to hear, and could make you laugh by repeating, but laughter was not uppermost.|$|R
50|$|In 1832, blue {{stone was}} quarried in nearby Toodlum (now Veteran).At one time, 2,000 men were {{employed}} in quarrying, <b>dressing</b> and <b>shipping</b> about {{one and a half}} million dollars’ worth of blue stone annually from Glasco, Malden, and Saugerties. Blue stone was used for curbing, paving, door sills, and window sills: much of it in New York City. The Ulster White Lead Company at Glenerie produced nine hundred tons of lead each year.|$|R

5000|$|Practice {{varies from}} country to country as to the order in which the signal flags are placed on the [...] "dressing lines": in some places a {{specific}} order is laid down, in others there is no such provision; either way, the intention is to produce a random succession of flags (i.e. not conveying any words or other messages), with the numerical and other pennants spaced equally and regularly along the line. Custom and regulations require that national or other flags not be mixed in with the signal flags when <b>dressing</b> a <b>ship</b> overall.|$|R

5000|$|Princeton made a trial {{trip in the}} Delaware River on October 12, 1843. She {{departed}} Philadelphia on October 17 for a sea trial, {{proceeded to}} New York, where she engaged in a speed contest with the British steamer , besting her handily, and thence returned to Philadelphia on October 20 to finish outfitting. On November 22, Captain Stockton reported [...] "Princeton {{will be ready for}} sea in a week." [...] On November 28, he <b>dressed</b> <b>ship</b> and received visitors on board for inspection. On November 30, she towed the USS Raritan down the Delaware and later returned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Princeton sailed on January 1, 1844, for New York, where she received her two big guns, named Peacemaker and Oregon. Princeton was sent to Washington, D.C., in late January, arriving on February 13. Washingtonians displayed great interest in the ship and her guns. She made trial trips with passengers on board down the Potomac River on February 16, 18, and 20, during which the Peacemaker was fired several times. The Tyler administration promoted the ship as part of its campaign for naval expansion and Congress adjourned for February 20 so that members could tour the ship. Former President John Quincy Adams, now a congressman and skeptical of both territorial expansion and the armaments required to support it, said the Navy welcomed politicians [...] "to fire their souls with patriotic ardor for a naval war".|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Operation Potomac" [...] on December 9, 1962, with {{guest star}} Richard Eastham, O'Toole tries to {{determine}} why someone {{sent him a}} <b>dress</b> while the <b>ship</b> is in port near Washington, D.C. The unsolicited gift inspired lots of ribbing from his fellow crew members. Eventually, O'Toole learns the dress was for a female naval officer with the same name assigned to the same installation.|$|R
25|$|Certain costly inefficiencies were {{inherent}} {{in the process of}} transporting live animals by rail, particularly {{due to the fact that}} some sixty percent of the animal's mass is composed of inedible matter.

50|$|The carrier's hangar deck was {{featured}} in the film as a cargo hold, which was repainted and filled with polystyrene modules representing futuristic cargo containers. Her flight command area was heavily modified to represent the control room and living quarters of the fictional space ship crew. Bulkheads were cut out and replaced with wider passageways to allow for camera and actor movement. Set pieces, computer consoles, and various props were moved in to <b>dress</b> the <b>ship</b> as the space freighter. The production crew was allowed to do anything they wanted with the ship, as long as no metal was removed. All power and water had to be imported, as the crew {{was not allowed to}} use ship power. Filming was hampered by the tight confines of the carrier, necessitating several innovations in the filming process.|$|R
50|$|Mining and {{quarrying}} industries commonly use a wire saw to cut hard stone {{into large}} blocks that {{can then be}} shipped to processing plants to be further refined (in the case of ore <b>dressing)</b> or <b>shipped</b> to distributors (in the case of granite or marble for building). These wire saws are large machines that use diamond-impregnated beads on a cable. The saws allow {{the bottom of a}} quarry slab to be cut free (after the cable is passed through access drill holes); with the bottom cut, back and side charges (explosives) can cleanly cleave the slab. Quarry saws on this principle date back centuries; before the era of steel cables with diamond cutters, there were fiber ropes that drew sand through the kerf. The sand (flushed with water) cut the stone (albeit more slowly than diamond does today).|$|R
2500|$|Upon {{arrival at}} the local {{processing}} facility, livestock were either slaughtered by wholesalers and delivered fresh to nearby butcher shops for retail sale, smoked, or packed for shipment in barrels of salt. Costly inefficiencies were inherent in transporting live animals by rail, particularly the fact that about {{sixty percent of the}} animal's mass is inedible. [...] The death of animals weakened by the long drive further increased the per-unit shipping cost. Meat sought a way to <b>ship</b> <b>dressed</b> meats from his Chicago packing plant to eastern markets.|$|R

2500|$|Gustavus Franklin Swift (June 24, 1839 [...] March 29, 1903) was an American {{business}} executive. He {{founded a}} meat-packing empire in the Midwest {{during the late}} nineteenth century, over which he presided until his death. He is credited {{with the development of}} the first practical ice-cooled railroad car, which allowed his company to <b>ship</b> <b>dressed</b> meats to all parts of the country and abroad, ushering in the [...] "era of cheap beef." [...] Swift pioneered the use of animal by-products for the manufacture of soap, glue, fertilizer, various types of sundries, and even medical products.|$|R
50|$|Governor Molesworth of Jamaica {{wrote in}} August 1687 that Bear had turned pirate, openly attacking English ships. Bear had {{transferred}} his allegiance to Spain, marrying a supposed noblewoman in Havana with much celebration. Molesworth was not fooled: “The nobleman's daughter is a strumpet {{that he used}} to carry with him in man's apparel, and is the daughter of a rum-punch-woman of Port Royal.” Bear apparently had kept his soon-to-be wife aboard his <b>ship,</b> <b>dressed</b> in men’s clothes. Under Spanish colors he sailed as a guarda costa privateer, patrolling from Havana and Puerto Rico.|$|R

The date {{turns out to be}} far from what she expects. It is aboard a [...] "rum boat", a ship that sails beyond the 12 mile limit to get around the restrictions of Prohibition. Worse, Frank {{turns out to be a}} cad. When she tries to leave, he locks the door and tries to force himself on her, tearing her <b>dress.</b> Fortunately, the <b>ship</b> drifts back into U.S. waters and a police raid stops him from going any further.

On January 12, 1939 the Grand Central Galleries informed Weaver that his work Rehearsal {{had been sent to}} the Pennsylvania Academy Jury. In the meantime, Rehearsal was included in the Academy's Founder's Show and then it was slated to go to The 16th Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary American Oil Paintings at the Corcoran Gallery of Art from March 26 to May 7, 1939.

50|$|Thompson {{had been}} a Maryland farm boy who served one cruise with the Navy; however {{in the summer of}} 1934 he was jobless, making him a good target for recruiting. His handler was an officer of the Imperial Japanese Navy, Lt. Cmdr. Toshio Miyazaki (少佐宮崎敏夫 Shōsa Miyazaki Toshio), who was an {{exchange}} student of English at Stanford University. Miyazaki, a.k.a. Mr. Tanni, recruited Thompson in San Pedro, California by offering to pay him $500 initially and an additional $200 monthly. He was persuaded to board U.S. Navy <b>ships</b> <b>dressed</b> in a yeoman's uniform, for the purpose of gathering information from the crews. Through this and other methods, he was able to sell engineering, gunnery, and tactical information about the Pacific Fleet that was mainly based in nearby San Diego at that time.|$|R
60|$|Quietly but {{steadily}} did Mrs Dashwood {{pursue her}} work. Neat little under-garments, and fairy-like little socks, and indescribable little articles of Lilliputian clothing of various kinds, all {{telling of the}} little rosebud in the crib, passed rapidly through Mary's nimble fingers, and {{came out of the}} tub fair as the driven snow. Soon the front of the fire-place became like a <b>ship</b> <b>dressed</b> with flags, with this difference, that the flags instead of being gay and parti-coloured, were white and suggestive of infancy and innocence. The gentle noise of washing, and the soft breathing of the sleepers, and the tiny ticking of the clock over the chimney-piece, were the only audible sounds, for London had reached its deadest hour, four o'clock. Rioters had exhausted their spirits, natural and artificial, and early risers had not begun to move.|$|R
25|$|With King Ecgfrith off {{fighting}} the Picts, Cuthbert visits the queen at Carlise; as Cuthbert is conducted by Waga, the city's reeve, he announces {{that the war}} is over and that the Ecgfrith has been slain; it was later revealed that Cuthbert's assertion happened at the same hour as the king's death in battle (chapter eight). At Carlisle Cuthbert meets an anchorite named Hereberht,who asks to die at the same day and hour as Cuthbert; the request is granted, and subsequently both go to heaven on the same hour of the same night (chapter nine). Cuthbert, dining at Ovington with abbess Ælfflæd, predicts the death of one of Ælfflæd's servants, Hadwald (chapter ten). The bishop resigns his bishopric after an episcopate of two years and returns to Farne (chapter eleven). Miracles continue as Cuthbert cures a ("still surviving") brother named Walhstod from dysentery. Cuthbert dies on Farne, and his body was washed and <b>dressed</b> before being <b>shipped</b> to Lindisdfarne (chapter thirteen).|$|R
50|$|At {{this point}} in time, {{there is a large}} <b>ship</b> <b>dressed</b> up as an {{ordinary}} cargo ship within the middle of Tokyo Bay. At the top of this hidden ship are four large tomahawk missiles which are pointed at Greater Tokyo. The FF armed terrorist organization is behind this whole issue. If the FF leaders are given back to this organization—in which they are currently captured—the terrorist organization will not need to launch its missiles to destroy the greater portion of Tokyo. Such an action is forced because the FF terrorists are also equipped with hostages; if the CIA refuses to move, the missiles will automatically be fired and many shall be killed. Thus, the organization needs its members released within the time span of 24 hours. Due to the severity of this issue, the Prime Minister has assigned for Musashi to effectively stop this scheme as a member of Ultimate Blue—the most secret of organizations.|$|R
