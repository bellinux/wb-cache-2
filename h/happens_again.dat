5|$|Animals {{eventually}} follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, {{he allows}} Evan latitude at first, but warns {{him that he}} will no longer tolerate it if it <b>happens</b> <b>again</b> in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells Evan that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has been talking to him and is responsible for his new look and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that God will not allow him {{to take it off}} and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe halfway through the session. Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission, although Long does not take him seriously, and Evan is fired from Congress and later removed his name from the Public Land Act bill. Evan deduces that God purposely had him fired from Congress, so that he would have more time to build the ark. In continued skepticism, Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he was going insane.|$|E
500|$|A {{day after}} the Leicester City match, Arsenal paraded the Premier League trophy on an open-top bus, in front of more than 250,000 fans. The victory parade {{commenced}} at Highbury and ended at Islington Town Hall. At the town hall balcony, Vieira addressed the crowd: [...] "It has been a fantastic season. We achieved something unbelievable but we couldn't {{have done it without}} the fans." [...] In an interview with the BBC, Dein added: [...] "We've seen history made and I'd be surprised if it <b>happens</b> <b>again.</b> It's just been a privilege to watch Arsenal this season." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Zandvoort, Rindt gained {{confidence}} in the new Lotus 72, describing it as [...] "the best racing car that exists at the moment". But he continued to have problems. During practice for the French Grand Prix, Rindt opted to drop his new all-enveloping Bell-Star crash helmet, finding it too hot. He went back to using his open-front helmet, only to be hit in the face by a stone from another car, causing a deep cut on his right cheek. He also suffered a steering failure on his car. Furious over yet another mechanical problem, he stormed into the Lotus garage and yelled at Colin Chapman: [...] "If this <b>happens</b> <b>again</b> and I survive, I will kill all of you!" [...] Rindt {{was still able to}} win the race, taking the lead in the championship. The next race was the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch. Jacky Ickx established an early lead ahead of Brabham and Rindt, but when Ickx's transmission failed, Rindt seized the opportunity to pass Brabham for the lead. Brabham was then able to regain the top spot on lap 69 as Rindt missed a gear and looked the certain winner, only to repeat his misfortune of Monaco: on the last lap, he ran out of fuel, allowing Rindt to take his third win in a row. His victory was cast into doubt shortly after the race when Chief Scrutineer Cecil Mitchell found the rear aerofoil not at the regulated height. Rindt was provisionally disqualified, only to be reinstated as winner after three hours of deliberation.|$|E

Yonni Barrios said [...] "We're thinking about creating a foundation to solve [...] problems in the mining industry.

[...] Juan Illanes told El Mercurio [...] "We have to decide how to direct our project so this type of thing never <b>happens</b> <b>again.</b> It needs to be done, but these things don't happen quickly".|$|E
2500|$|There {{is similar}} {{evidence}} that Luke resided in Troas, the province {{which included the}} ruins of ancient Troy, in that he writes in Acts {{in the third person}} about Paul and his travels until they get to Troas, where he switches to the first person plural. The [...] "we" [...] section of Acts continues until the group leaves Philippi, when his writing goes back to the third person. This change <b>happens</b> <b>again</b> when the group returns to Philippi. There are three [...] "we sections" [...] in Acts, all following this rule. Luke never stated, however, that he lived in Troas, and this is the only evidence that he did.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2009, Google countered ongoing critics {{by stating}} that its {{scanning}} of books and putting them online would protect the world's cultural heritage; Google co-founder Sergey Brin stated, [...] "The famous Library of Alexandria burned three times, in 48BC, AD273 and AD640, as did the Library of Congress, where a fire in 1851 destroyed two-thirds of the collection. I hope such destruction never <b>happens</b> <b>again,</b> but history would suggest otherwise." [...] This characterization was rebuked by Pam Samuelson, UC Berkeley Professor of Law saying [...] "Libraries everywhere are terrified that Google will engage in price-gouging when setting prices for institutional subscriptions to GBS contents ... Brin forgot to mention another significant difference between GBS and traditional libraries: their policies on patron privacy. ... Google has been unwilling to make meaningful commitments to protect user privacy. Traditional libraries, by contrast, have been important guardians of patron privacy." [...] Others have denounced the settlement for neglecting to protect reader privacy.|$|E

2500|$|In one variant, Raven {{is taught}} by his father, Kit-ka'ositiyi-qa, to be a creator, but Raven is {{unsatisfied}} with the result. He creates {{the world but}} is unable to give it light or water. [...] On hearing that light could be found hidden in a far-off land, Raven decides to travel there and steal it. [...] In the house of light, he finds a young woman living with her father and plays {{the first of many}} tricks. [...] He turns himself into a small speck of dirt, slips into her drinking water, and is swallowed. [...] The daughter becomes pregnant and she gave birth to an unusual and fussy child who cries constantly and demands to touch one of the bundles which has been stored hanging from the walls. [...] The child is given one of the bags to quiet him, but when he tires of playing with it, he lets it go, and it floats away from him and disappears through the smoke hole. [...] Once it reaches the sky the bundle comes undone and scatters stars across the sky. [...] When the child cries to have it back again he is given the second bundle to play with and lets it float away {{through the hole in the}} ceiling, thus releasing the moon. [...] It all <b>happens</b> <b>again</b> with the third and last bundle, which flies away and becomes sunlight. [...] After bringing light to the whole world, he too flies out through the smoke hole.|$|E
2500|$|Tony and Mandy begin a relationship. Dunn {{said that}} when she was first {{informed}} of the storyline she was surprised. She added that although she felt the pairing was unlikely, [...] "it did actually work". The pair marry and later have a child who they name Grace. Grace dies from suspected SIDS and the pair split. Pickard said [...] "If they hadn't lost a child, they might have stayed together the first time round. They were really happy before that happened". Dunn said that the storyline worked well, saying [...] "as much as it was really difficult. By that stage, Nick and I both knew how we would play things and it worked". Tony leaves Hollyoaks with Mandy and her daughter. Tony returns three months later without Mandy. Dunn explained the reason for Tony leaving Mandy saying: [...] "Mandy told Tony she couldn't have more children and he freaked out and left her in Laos". Dunn revealed Mandy wanted revenge for this. In 2011 Tony leaves the village and returns three months later having reinvented himself. Pickard said despite Tony's changes [...] "Tony is still the same person and he loves Mandy". Speaking about the couple's future, Dunn told Taryn Davies of Femalefirst: [...] "they've been on and off for years and they're a great couple and I think that they make a great couple and I think it's such a shame that just as they get happy something horrendous <b>happens</b> <b>again.</b> So there's the possibility that their relationship might be re-kindled".|$|E

6000|$|Moreover, {{you must}} learn God's judgments; {{the way in which}} He rewards and punishes men. And those too you will learn in the Bible, which is full of {{accounts}} of the just and merciful judgments of God. And you may learn them too from your own experience in life; from seeing what actually happens to those whom you know, when they do right things; and what <b>happens</b> <b>again,</b> when they do wrong things. If any man will open his eyes to what is going on around him in a single city, or in the mere private circle of his own kinsfolk and acquaintance; if he will but use his common sense, and look how righteousness is rewarded, and sin is punished, all day long, then he might learn enough and to spare about God's judgments: but men will not. A man will see his neighbour do wrong, and suffer for it: and then go and do exactly the same thing himself; as if there were no living God; no judgments of God; as if all was accident and chance; as if he was to escape scot-free, while his neighbour next door has brought shame and misery on himself by doing the same thing. For it was well written of old, [...] "The fool hath said in his heart--though he is afraid to say it with his lips--There is no God." [...] And the man who wrote the 119th Psalm knew that, and said, [...] "I remembered Thine everlasting judgments, O Lord, and received comfort; for I was horribly afraid for the ungodly who forsake Thy law." ...|$|E

But it would not be in human nature if the man you call John Harvey should take his defeat without trying to pay you back for that wound you gave him, for getting Mistress Nellie out of his hands, and for making him the laughing-stock of his comrades. I tell you that there is scarce an evening that I have gone out but some fellow passes me before I have gone twenty yards, and, as he brushes my sleeve, turns his head to look at me. But yesternight I said to one who so behaved, 'Look here, mate, {{this is not the first}} time you have run against me. I warn you that if it <b>happens</b> <b>again</b> I will crack your head with my cudgel.' The fellow went off, muttering and grumbling, but I have no doubt that he and the others, for it certainly was not always the same man, were watching for you. To-night there was no one about, or, if there was, he did not come near me, and it may be that, finding you never leave the house after nightfall, they have decided to give it up for the present. But I thought I heard a footfall lower down the street, just as we came out of the house, and it is like enough that we are followed now." ...|$|E
