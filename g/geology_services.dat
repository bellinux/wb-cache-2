Carlosruizite was found as ~200 μm platy {{crystals}} in samples of iquiqueite, Na4K3Mg(CrO4)B24O39(OH)·12H2O, obtained by leaching caliche amarillo (yellow nitrate ore) from samples in the Iquique {{office of the}} former Servicio de Minas del Estado of Chile, now the National <b>Geology</b> and Mining <b>Service</b> (SERNAGEOMIN).

Of the 25 species of saline minerals that have been identified in the Chilean nitrate ores, 11 are known to be associated with carlosruizite. The dense caliche amarillo containing carlosruizite consists chiefly of a fine-grained mixture of nitratine, halite, and darapskite.

40|$|The {{research}} {{seeking the}} geometric characterization of Fortalezaâs Sedimentary Geologic Domain {{was based on}} SIAGAS/CPRM (Mineral Resources Research Company) and GEOHIDRO (<b>Geology</b> Hydrogeology and <b>Services)</b> tubular wells records which combined reach the mark of 1166 tubular wells recorded until December 2012. The wells that had a geologic profile totaling 516 were analyzed according to their lithological characteristics technical-constructive aspects and hydrogeological parameters. After the bibliographic revision and the wellâs reports gathering the data contained on that reports were organized in sheets maps tables graphics and figures. So then 274 lithological profiles of the 516 recorded were selected to elaborate the fourteen geologic profiles being seven on N-S direction and seven on W-E direction. These geological profiles allowed {{a better view of}} the sedimentary packages as well as the crystalline basement and its contour allowing a much more accurate interpretation about the way the sedimentary domain behaves compared {{to the top of the}} basement. From the profiles analysis was conclusive that the sedimentary package tends to increase its thickness when approaches the coast. It was observed that the sedimentary domain contains a Carbonate Formation located on the N/NE part of the area classified at first as a infra-Barreiras formation that becomes more thick when approaches the coast zone. It is worth mentioning that the sedimentary package has a more embracing geometry than that related on previous studies. The analysis of that profiles also revealed elevated parts of the basement (structural highs) and depocenters assimilated to horsts and grabens in N-S direction. Analyzing the top and base data of the 137 wells that contains the mantle of alteration from the basement it was possible to draw its contour and measure the average of its thickness that is something about seventeen meters. Among the structures we can highlight the lineaments located on the east part of NW-SE direction and in the center-south part of NE-SW direction. Secondly the faults of NE direction and the fractures of NE NW and W-E direction are observed in the W SW S center-south and SE parts of the area. Apparently the great drainage segments were affected by the lineaments faults and fractures. On the sedimentary hydrogeological domain the hydrogeological parameters presented the following values: from the data collected on 267 wells that had a profile the average of the Static Level presented was 8. 4 meters and from 265 wells with a profile the average output presented was 416 mÂ/h. Now on the crystalline hydrogeological domain the average values was: from the data collected on 237 wells the average of the Static Level was 8. 85 meters and from data collected on 236 wells the average output was 41 mÂ/h. Now the saturated thickness (here considered the sum of the filter columns) calculated from 378 wells presented an average of 24. 4 meters with a standard deviation below 20 % which attests a tolerable average dispersionA pesquisa visando a CaracterizaÃÃo GeomÃtrica do DomÃnio GeolÃgico Sedimentar de Fortaleza teve como base o cadastro de poÃos tubulares SIAGAS/CPRM (Companhia de Pesquisa e Recursos Minerais) e da empresa GEOHIDRO (Geologia Hidrogeologia e ServiÃos Ltda.) que somados totalizam 1166 poÃos tubulares cadastrados atÃ dezembro de 2012. Os poÃos que apresentam perfil litolÃgico em um total de 516 foram analisados segundo suas caracterÃsticas litolÃgicas aspectos tÃcnico-construtivos e parÃmetros hidrogeolÃgicos. ApÃs a revisÃo bibliogrÃfica e a coleta dos relatÃrios de poÃos os dados contidos nestes relatÃrios foram organizados em planilhas mapas tabelas grÃficos e figuras. Foram entÃo selecionados 274 perfis litolÃgicos dos 516 perfis cadastrados para a elaboraÃÃo de 14 perfis geolÃgicos sendo 7 perfis geolÃgicos na direÃÃo N-S e 7 perfis geolÃgicos na direÃÃo W-E. Estes perfis permitiram uma melhor visualizaÃÃo dos pacotes sedimentares assim como do embasamento cristalino e de seu contorno possibilitando uma interpretaÃÃo mais precisa da forma como se comporta o domÃnio sedimentar em relaÃÃo ao topo do embasamento cristalino. Da anÃlise dos perfis geolÃgicos concluiu-se que o pacote sedimentar tende a aumentar sua espessura na medida em que se aproxima do litoral. Foi observado que o domÃnio sedimentar contÃm uma FormaÃÃo CalcÃria localizada na porÃÃo N/NE da Ãrea classificada a prori como Infra-Barreiras que se torna mais espessa Ã medida que se aproxima da zona litorÃnea. Vale ressaltar que o pacote sedimentar tem uma geometria mais abrangente do que a relatada em trabalhos anteriores. A anÃlise desses perfis revelou ainda altos estruturais e depocentros assemelhados a horst e graben alinhados na direÃÃo N-S. Analisando os dados de topo e base dos 137 poÃos que contÃm o manto alterado foi possÃvel desenhar o seu contorno e medir sua espessura mÃdia que Ã de aproximadamente 17 metros. Dentre as estruturas podem ser destacados os lineamentos situados na porÃÃo oeste de direÃÃo NW-SE e na porÃÃo centro-sul de direÃÃo NE-SW. Secundariamente a falha de sentido NEe as fraturas de sentido NE NW e W-E sÃo observadas nas porÃÃes W SW S centro-sul e SE da Ãrea. Aparentemente os grandes seguimentos da drenagem foram influenciados pelos lineamentos falhas e fraturas do terreno. No domÃnio hidrogeolÃgico sedimentar os parÃmetros hidrogeolÃgicos apresentaram os valores que se seguem: a partir de dados colhidos em 267 poÃos com perfil a mÃdia do NÃvel EstÃtico (NE) apresentada foi de 84 metros e a partir de 265 poÃos com perfil a VazÃo mÃdia (Q mÃdia) apresentada foi de 416 mÂ/h. JÃ no domÃnio hidrogeolÃgico cristalino os parÃmetros hidrogeolÃgicos apresentaram os seguintes valores: a partir de dados colhidos em 237 poÃos a mÃdia do NÃvel EstÃtico (NE) apresentada foi de 885 metros e a partir de dados colhidos em 236 poÃos a VazÃo mÃdia (Q mÃdia) apresentada foi de 41 mÂ/h. JÃ a espessura saturada (aqui considerada o somatÃrio da coluna de filtros) calculada a partir dos dados de 378 poÃos apresentou uma mÃdia de 244 metros com desvio padrÃo abaixo de 20 % o que atesta uma dispersÃo mÃdia tolerÃve...|$|R
