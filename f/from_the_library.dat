5|$|A devastating fire in 1890 gutted the {{interior}} of University College and destroyed thirty-three thousand volumes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>library,</b> but the university restored the building and replenished its library within two years. Over the next two decades, a collegiate system took shape as the university arranged federation with several ecclesiastical colleges, including Strachan's Trinity College in 1904. The university operated the Royal Conservatory of Music from 1896 to 1991 and the Royal Ontario Museum from 1912 to 1968; both still retain close ties with the university as independent institutions. The University of Toronto Press was founded in 1901 as Canada's first academic publishing house. The Faculty of Forestry, founded in 1907 with Bernhard Fernow as dean, was Canada's first university faculty devoted to forest science. In 1910, the Faculty of Education opened its laboratory school, the University of Toronto Schools.|$|E
5|$|Between 1893 and 1897, {{the years}} when Bauer and Nold were also in the Western Penitentiary for their part in the {{assassination}} attempt, the three men surreptitiously produced 60 issues of a hand-written anarchist newsletter by transferring their work from cell to cell. They managed to send the completed newsletters, which they called Prison Blossoms, to friends outside the prison. Participating in Prison Blossoms, initially written in German and later in English, helped Berkman improve his English. He developed a friendship with the prison chaplain, John Lynn Milligan, who was a strong advocate {{on behalf of the}} prison library. Milligan encouraged Berkman to read books <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>library,</b> a process that furthered his knowledge of English.|$|E

5|$|In November 1533, {{before the}} {{appearance}} of the fifth edition, Sepúlveda sent Erasmus a description of the ancient Vatican manuscript, informing him that it differed from the text which he had edited in favour of the Vulgate in 365 places. We do not know anything about these 365 readings except for one. Erasmus in Adnotationes to Acts 27:16 wrote that according to the Codex <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> Pontifici (i.e. Codex Vaticanus) name of the island is καυδα (Cauda), not κλαυδα (Clauda) as in his Novum Testamentum (Tamet si quidam admonent in codice Graeco pontificiae bibliothecae scriptum haberi, καυδα, id est, cauda). In another letter sent to Erasmus in 1534 Sepúlveda informed him, that Greek manuscripts were altered from the Vulgate.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the manuscript's early history. According to Hort, {{it was written in}} the West, {{probably}} in Rome, as suggested {{by the fact that the}} chapter division in the Acts common to Sinaiticus and Vaticanus occurs in no other Greek manuscript, but is found in several manuscripts of the Latin Vulgate. Robinson countered this argument, suggesting that this system of chapter divisions was introduced into the Vulgate by Jerome himself, as a result of his studies at Caesarea. According to Kenyon the forms of the letters are Egyptian and they were found in Egyptian papyri of earlier date. Gardthausen Ropes and Jellicoe thought it was written in Egypt. Harris believed that the manuscript came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> of Pamphilus at Caesarea, Palestine. Streeter, Skeat, and Milne also believed that it was produced in Caesarea.|$|E
5|$|The Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya, which {{contains}} {{the tomb of}} Amir Taybars, was built in 1309. Originally intended {{to function as a}} complementary mosque to al-Azhar it has since been integrated {{with the rest of the}} mosque. The Maliki and Shāfi‘ī madh'hab were studied in this madrasa, though it now is used to hold manuscripts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>library.</b> The only surviving piece from the original is the qibla wall and its polychrome mihrab. Al-Maqrizi reported that the madrasa was used only for studying the Shāfi‘ī while the historian Ibn Duqmaq reported that one of the liwans in the madrasa was reserved for Shāfi‘ī teachings while the other was for Maliki teachings.|$|E
50|$|Thereafter <b>the</b> <b>library</b> benefitted <b>from</b> various private {{collections}} and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>libraries</b> of other religious orders {{which had been}} dissolved as well as duplicates <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Imperial <b>Library</b> in Vienna. <b>From</b> 1788, <b>the</b> collection was enhanced by adding publications received under legal deposit regulations which covered works published in the State of Milan. As a result, the Braidense became the regional legal deposit archive for Lombardy.|$|R

5|$|The local {{government}} includes a mayor and city council members. The current mayor is Rick Bohle. The current city council members are Neal Rolling, Ron Mathers, Dave Dugan, Keith Bohle, and Dan Peters. Rolling is a co-owner of Rick and Neal Rolling's Rolling Oil Co. and Dugan is an insurance agent at Jim Harvey Agency, Inc. A library and city hall combination began construction in May 1999 with $400,000 raised {{from the city}} {{and the rest of the}} funds coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> and grants. The staff started working from the new building in February 2000. Vicki Sitzmann is the current city clerk. Mayors from the beginning of Kingsley's founding were J. S. Ellis (1884), G. A. Garrard (1885 and 1886), C. B. Oldfield (1887 to 1989), and F. R. Robinson (1890).|$|E
5|$|To do this, Rincewind is told to {{discover}} who they are, and recover a golden item from each, since these items {{are what they}} use to control the dragon. Learning that a book about summoning dragons had been stolen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> at Unseen University the night before, Rincewind gains access to L-Space, allowing him to journey into the past, witness the theft, and follow the thief back to the brotherhood's hideout. After gaining entry in disguise, Rincewind learns that each member holds {{a role in the}} city — Chucky the Fool, the Thief, the Mason, the Chimney Sweep, the Fishmonger, and the Dunny King — and seeks to change the city so they can have a better future for themselves. Acquiring their golden items, Rincewind brings them to the dragon, only to learn it will not return to its dimension but seek revenge on the brotherhood before coming after him. Wishing to stop this, Rincewind decides to prevent the summoning book from being stolen, by switching it for one that makes love custard. In his efforts to be recognised for stopping the dragon, Rincewind gets into an argument with the Patrician over the existence of dragons, summoning the very same one back to Discworld. An annoyed Patrician tasks Rincewind to deal with it.|$|E
