5|$|It's {{definitely}} riskier {{than something}} a bit more... simple. I <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> track and loved {{that it was}} so different: it felt a bit African, a bit electronic and futuristic. It reminded me of what I love, which is mixing different cultures and eras — things that typically don't go together — to create a new sound. I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish one thing, I just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am.|$|E
500|$|A {{writer from}} MTV Buzzworthy stated they were [...] "sold" [...] on the concept; The Daily Mails Jessica Satherley also responded well, noting that Roberts' [...] "adventurous dance moves {{certainly}} give her Girls Aloud pal Cheryl Cole {{a run for}} her money." [...] Daily Mail also reported that Perez Hilton liked the video; in a Twitter comment, he said [...] "I am dancing {{to the beat of}} my drum!!! <b>Just</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> song in full and I am LIVING for [...] new single! Vid looks HOT too!!".|$|E
2500|$|Just {{before the}} {{bulletin}} cut out, a CBS News staffer was heard saying [...] "Connally too," [...] apparently having <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> news that Texas Governor John Connally {{had also been}} shot while riding in the presidential limousine with his wife Nellie and Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not answer}} when Tom came and told him a new story he had <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> in <b>the</b> barroom.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> that <b>the</b> {{solicitor}} {{is to be}} seen to-morrow. Possibly, therefore, I shall {{return in}} the evening after you get this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{went to see}} old George Willett," [...] said Anne. [...] "The {{poor old}} man has <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>the</b> death of his {{daughter}} at Wil'sbro'." ...|$|R
2500|$|Turning down Decca's {{recommended}} {{material as}} too commercial, Stewart {{insisted that the}} experienced session musicians he was given, including John Paul Jones, learn a couple of Sonny Boy Williamson songs he had <b>just</b> <b>heard.</b> <b>The</b> resulting single, [...] "Good Morning Little Schoolgirl", was recorded released in October 1964; despite Stewart performing it on the popular television show Ready Steady Go!, it failed to enter the charts. Also in October Stewart left the Hoochie Coochie Men after having a row with Baldry.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1971, Harold C. Schonberg, {{music critic}} at The New York Times, having <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> Rifkin album, wrote a {{featured}} Sunday edition article entitled [...] "Scholars, Get Busy on Scott Joplin!" [...] Schonberg's {{call to action}} {{has been described as}} the catalyst for classical music scholars, the sort of people Joplin had battled all his life, to conclude that Joplin was a genius. Vera Brodsky Lawrence of the New York Public Library published a two-volume set of Joplin works in June 1971, entitled The Collected Works of Scott Joplin, stimulating a wider interest in the performance of Joplin's music.|$|E

After passing her audition, she sang Donna Summer's [...] "On the Radio" [...] for the broadcast, and {{eventually}} won the contest. She also appeared on and won Steps to the Stars (a TV programme hosted by H & Claire of the group Steps). Stone then performed on a charity show, where she drew the attention of the Boilerhouse Boys, composed of London-based producers Andy Dean and Ben Wolfe, who contacted S-Curve Records founder and CEO, Steve Greenberg in December 2001 telling him that [...] "they had <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> greatest singer they'd ever heard from their country."

50|$|Tocmai îl auzii pe George la radio. I have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> George on <b>the</b> radio.|$|R
60|$|So far Master Busy had obeyed, but at {{the last}} moment, just before {{starting}} for Acol village, Sir Marmaduke had caught sight of Mistress Charity talking to the stableman in the yard. Something in the wench's eyes told him--with absolute certainty that she had <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>the</b> murder.|$|R
6000|$|We joined them, and the {{conversation}} soon turned on the sermon we had <b>just</b> <b>heard,</b> <b>the</b> subject of which was 'selfishness.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Armstrong," [...] said Frank, [...] "I have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> most horrid {{story that}} {{ever came to}} my ears. That wretch, Barry Lynch, has tried to induce Doctor Colligan to poison his sister!" ...|$|E
60|$|She had <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> news, and {{she could}} {{scarcely}} speak, but she folded the young girl, her dear pet lamb, in her arms, and rocking herself to and fro she sobbed and eased her aching, motherly heart.|$|E
60|$|My Lords,--Agreeably to your Lordships' proclamation, which I have <b>just</b> <b>heard,</b> and <b>the</b> duty enjoined {{me by the}} House of Commons, I {{come forward}} to make good their charge of {{high crimes and misdemeanors}} against Warren Hastings, Esquire, late Governor-General of Bengal, and now a {{prisoner}} at your bar.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{very bad}} news indeed," [...] Mr. Hebblethwaite answered, raising his voice a little, so that every one at the table might hear him. [...] "I have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> from <b>the</b> War Office that Germany has {{declared}} war against Russia. You will perhaps, under the circumstances, excuse me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "P. S.--I have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> from <b>the</b> lawyers. They {{have found}} out the name the woman passed by in London. If this {{discovery}} (not a very important one, I am afraid) suggests any new course of proceeding to you, pray act on it at once. The name is--Miss Gwilt." ...|$|R
60|$|Oliver {{leaned his}} head upon his hand {{when the old}} man disappeared, and pondered, with a {{trembling}} heart, on the words he had <b>just</b> <b>heard.</b> <b>The</b> more {{he thought of the}} Jew's admonition, the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is but fair, Campbell. First, though, I {{will tell}} you a piece of news that I have <b>just</b> <b>heard.</b> <b>The</b> queen sent off a {{messenger}} two days ago to Turenne, and {{it is believed that}} he is to have the command of the army on the Rhine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> news, Colonel. The {{regiment}} is heartbroken but, {{in their}} fury, they went at the French facing them and scattered them like sheep. Canovas, who told me, {{said that you}} were not bleeding much, and that he and the others had bandaged you up according to your instructions.|$|E
60|$|<b>Just</b> then, Phonny <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> {{sound of}} wheels behind him. He turned round {{and saw a}} wagon coming along the road.|$|R
6000|$|Next morning, while Captain Wopper {{was seated}} conversing {{with his old}} landlady at the breakfast-table--the morning meal having been <b>just</b> concluded--he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> voice of Gillie White in the court.

6000|$|... "I {{have sent}} the book off, and after being {{at work on}} it so long, I feel disinclined to do {{anything}} else," [...] she said. [...] "I've <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> from <b>the</b> publishers; they don't seem enthusiastic. After all, one couldn't expect that--the style of the thing is rather out of the usual course." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} have not gone, colonel--I was afraid you might have left, for I have been longer than I expected.

6000|$|... "I've <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> captain {{give his}} opinion on that subject, {{and he says}} that the boat can be got ready in a week or less, and that, with strict economy, the {{provisions}} we have will last us long enough to enable us to make the Cape, supposing we have good weather and fair winds. That's his opinion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor can I fail to {{appreciate}} the virtue that has kept your lips sealed against words of love for this Heliumite, Thuvia, for I know that I have but <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> first declaration of your passion for him. I do not condemn you. Rather should I have condemned you had you entered a loveless marriage with me.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is Cienfuegos Bay," [...] {{returned}} Caleb. [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> one of <b>the</b> officers say so. We're to lie {{at anchor}} until morning, and then perhaps the fun will commence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{not a man}} a-board as'll {{think that}} o' Dick Darvall," [...] growled the boatswain, who had <b>just</b> entered and <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> last remark.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> that <b>the</b> boy {{who fell}} through the pastrycook's window last night has died of the fright. He was {{suddenly}} called upon to pay three and sixpence for the damage done, and his constitution, it seems, was {{not strong enough to}} bear up against the shock. The inquest, it is said, will be held to-morrow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Peter didn't {{know what}} to make of it. All he could do was to gaze at Sticky-toes as if he thought Sticky-toes was a ghost. Just then the voice of Sammy Jay, or what sounded for all the world like Sammy's voice, screamed [...] "Thief! thief! thief!" [...] from the very spot where they had <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> voice of Sticky-toes.|$|E
60|$|The colonel now {{left the}} room, and the {{officers}} eagerly and excitedly talked over the startling news that they had <b>just</b> <b>heard.</b> <b>The</b> greater part {{of those who had}} been selected for the service were delighted to go, while the others were equally pleased, at the thought that they might shortly be fighting for King James on the soil of Ireland.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} will be coming with me, my good Clyffurde," [...] he said lightly, [...] "we are rowing in the same boat, you and I.

6000|$|... "There is no mistake," [...] Horace rejoined. [...] "I am repeating what I have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> from <b>the</b> lodge-keeper himself.

Of course he refused to give it." ...|$|R
50|$|I have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>the</b> work {{in which}} you are engaged, and I congratulate you upon it.
