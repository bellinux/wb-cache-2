5|$|Giridhar's initial {{education}} {{came from his}} paternal grandfather, as his father worked in Bombay. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoons,</b> his grandfather would narrate to him various episodes of the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, and devotional works like Vishramsagar, Sukhsagar, Premsagar, and Brajvilas. At the age of three, Giridhar composed his first piece of poetry—in Awadhi (a dialect of Hindi)—and recited it to his grandfather. In this verse, Krishna's foster mother Yashoda is fighting with a Gopi (milkmaid) for hurting Krishna.|$|E
5|$|Because of Southern Rhodesia's {{small size}} {{and lack of}} major controversies, its unicameral {{parliament}} then sat only twice a year, for about three months in total, holding discussions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoons</b> {{either side of a}} half-hour break for tea on the lawn. Smith's early parliamentary commitments in Salisbury therefore did not detract greatly from his ranching. His maiden speech to the Legislative Assembly, in November 1948, concerned the Union of South Africa Trade Agreement Bill, then at its second reading. He was slow to make an impact in parliament—most of his early contributions related to farming and mining—but his exertions within the party won him Stockil's respect and confidence. Janet ran Gwenoro during Smith's absences, and gave birth to his only biological child, Alec, in Gwelo on 20 May 1949.|$|E

Whilst there he developed a desire to become a teacher, however, growing up during the Great Depression as part of a large working-class family, Brown's parents were unable to afford to pay for his further education. Brown's other passion was for football; however, as Hexham played rugby he had to play as a standoff half for his school side on Saturday mornings and then as a centre half for a local youth football team <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoons.</b> Brown was a cousin of the England international footballer Austen Campbell, who played as a half-back for Huddersfield Town and Blackburn Rovers.|$|E
25|$|On October 30, 1957, WTTV {{became an}} {{independent}} station {{after losing the}} ABC affiliation to upstart WLWI (channel 13, now WTHR). In its early years as an independent, WTTV signed on at 2:00p.m. each weekday, running a test pattern until regular programming began at 4:00p.m. The station initially ran older movies and low-budget syndicated {{programs as well as}} some of its own locally produced programming. By the 1970s, WTTV began signing on by 6:00a.m. and stayed on the air until at least 2:00a.m. In addition to local programming, WTTV aired plenty of movies during the early afternoon hours and in primetime. It also aired cartoons, which were mixed in with locally produced children's programs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoons</b> from 3:00 to 5:00p.m. as well as off-network sitcoms in the evenings.|$|E

25|$|This job {{was as a}} {{part-time}} assistant in Booklovers' Corner, a second-hand bookshop in Hampstead run by Francis and Myfanwy Westrope, who were friends of Nellie Limouzin in the Esperanto movement. The Westropes were friendly and provided him with comfortable accommodation at Warwick Mansions, Pond Street. He was sharing the job with Jon Kimche, who also lived with the Westropes. Blair worked at the shop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoons</b> and had his mornings free to write and his evenings free to socialise. These experiences provided background for the novel Keep the Aspidistra Flying (1936). As well as the various guests of the Westropes, {{he was able to}} enjoy the company of Richard Rees and the Adelphi writers and Mabel Fierz. The Westropes and Kimche were members of the Independent Labour Party, although at this time Blair was not seriously politically active. He was writing for the Adelphi and preparing A Clergyman's Daughter and Burmese Days for publication.|$|E

500|$|At {{the heart}} of the Octavia Hill system was the weekly visit to collect rent. From the outset, Hill {{conceived}} this as a job for women only. She and her assistants (who included Emma Cons and Eva McLaren) combined the weekly rent collection with checking every detail of the premises and getting to know the tenants personally, acting as early social workers. At first Hill believed, [...] "Voluntary workers are a necessity. They are better than paid workers, and can be had in sufficient numbers." [...] Later, she found it expedient to maintain a paid workforce. Her system required a large staff. Rent was collected on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. Rent accounts were balanced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoons</b> and arrangements were made with contractors for repairs. On Thursdays and Fridays arrears were pursued, contractors' invoices paid, new tenancy lettings and tenants' moves organised.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the songs}} for The Beatles were written during a Transcendental Meditation course with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh, India, between February and April 1968. The retreat {{involved}} long periods of meditation, conceived by the band as a spiritual respite from all worldly endeavours – a chance, in John Lennon's words, to [...] "get away from everything". Both Lennon and Paul McCartney quickly re-engaged themselves in songwriting, often meeting [...] "clandestinely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoons</b> in each other's rooms" [...] to review their new work. [...] "Regardless of what I {{was supposed to be}} doing," [...] Lennon later recalled, [...] "I did write some of my best songs there." [...] Author Ian MacDonald said Sgt Pepper was [...] "shaped by LSD", but the Beatles took no drugs with them to India aside from marijuana, and their clear minds helped the group with their songwriting. The stay in Rishikesh proved especially fruitful for George Harrison as a songwriter, coinciding with his re-engagement with the guitar after two years studying the sitar. The musicologist Walter Everett likens Harrison's development as a composer in 1968 to that of Lennon and McCartney five years before, although he notes that Harrison became [...] "privately prolific", given his customary junior status in the group.|$|E
