50|$|<b>Dantrolene</b> <b>sodium</b> is a postsynaptic {{muscle relaxant}} that lessens excitation-contraction {{coupling}} in muscle cells. It achieves this by inhibiting Ca2+ ions release from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores by antagonizing ryanodine receptors. It {{is the primary}} drug used for the treatment and prevention of malignant hyperthermia, a rare, life-threatening disorder triggered by general anesthesia. It is also used {{in the management of}} neuroleptic malignant syndrome, muscle spasticity (e.g. after strokes, in paraplegia, cerebral palsy, or patients with multiple sclerosis), and 2,4-dinitrophenol poisoning, and the related compounds dinoseb and dinoterb.|$|E

In addition to tetrabenazine, this patient took lorazepam and two antidepressant drugs: clomipramine, a potent serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, and mianserin. Hyperthermia responded to parenteral <b>sodium</b> <b>dantrolene</b> and oral bromocriptine administration.

50|$|Baclofen, {{diazepam}} and dantrolene {{remain the}} three most commonly used pharmacologic agents {{in the treatment of}} spastic hypertonia. Baclofen is generally the drug of choice for spinal cord types of spasticity, while <b>sodium</b> <b>dantrolene</b> is the only agent which acts directly on muscle tissue. Tizanidine is also available. Phenytoin with chlorpromazine may be potentially useful if sedation does not limit their use. Ketazolam, not yet available in the United States, may be a significant addition to the pharmacologic armamentarium. Intrathecal administration of antispastic medications allows for high concentrations of drug near the site of action, which limits side effects.|$|R
50|$|Oral {{medications}} {{used for}} the treatment of spasticity include: diazepam (Valium), <b>dantrolene</b> <b>sodium,</b> baclofen, tizanidine, clonidine, gabapentin, and even cannabinoid-like compounds.³ The exact mechanism of these medications is not fully understood, but they are thought to act on neurotransmitters or neuromodulators within the central nervous system (CNS) or muscle itself, or to decrease the stretch reflexes. The problem with these medications is their potential side effects and the fact that, other than lessening painful or disruptive spasms and dystonic postures, drugs in general have not been shown to decrease impairments or lessen disabilities.|$|E
50|$|Susceptibility to {{malignant}} hyperthermia {{is often}} inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, {{for which there}} are at least six genetic loci of interest, the most prominent being the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1). MH susceptibility is phenotype and genetically related to central core disease (CCD), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized both by MH symptoms and by myopathy. MH is usually unmasked by anesthesia, or when a family member develops the symptoms. There is no simple, straightforward test to diagnose the condition. When MH develops during a procedure, treatment with <b>dantrolene</b> <b>sodium</b> is usually initiated; dantrolene and the avoidance of suxamethonium administration in susceptible people have markedly reduced the mortality from this condition.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intravenous}} injection {{of the muscle}} relaxant <b>dantrolene</b> <b>sodium</b> on ventilation, integrated EMG of external intercostal muscles and motor unit discharge in these muscles were measured in anaesthetized rats. <b>Dantrolene</b> <b>sodium</b> was administered in a carrier solution at pH 10. The carrier was {{not responsible for the}} effects seen on <b>dantrolene</b> <b>sodium</b> infusion. <b>Dantrolene</b> <b>sodium</b> (5 mg kg- 1 body weight) reduced inspired ventilation (VI) on average from 308 +/- 106 ml min- 1 (s. d., n = 8) in the control period to 247 +/- 118 ml min- 1 (n = 8) after <b>dantrolene</b> <b>sodium.</b> Expired ventilation was reduced likewise from 274 +/- 132 ml min- 1 (n = 8) to 229 +/- 109 ml min- 1 (n = 8). These changes are significant at P less than 0. 05. The integrated EMG was increased by 40. 0 +/- 29. 3 % (n = 9), a change significant at P less than 0. 001. <b>Dantrolene</b> <b>sodium</b> not only decreased the mean interspike interval of individual motor units by 16. 2 +/- 11. 1 % (n = 13), a change significant at P less than 0. 001, but also increased the duration of the burst of activity of each individual motor unit on average by 36. 2 +/- 52. 4 % (n = 13), a change significant at P less than 0. 05. The recruitment of additional motor units was also effected by <b>dantrolene</b> <b>sodium.</b> These units did not behave in any noticeably different manner from units previously active. It is concluded that the nervous system compensates for the effect of <b>dantrolene</b> <b>sodium</b> only to a limited extent by increasing the frequency of discharge of active motor units.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>dantrolene</b> (DaNa), a calcium {{antagonist}} specifically acting on skeletal muscles, were evaluated on the spontaneous contractions of ileum, uterine horns and longitudinal strips of esophageal smooth muscle, in vitro. DaNa (1. 81 to 15 μg/ml) caused a reversible dose-related {{increase of the}} spontaneous contractions of the three organs. DaNa (15 μg/ml) caused a 60 ± 3 % increase of the ileum spontaneous tone, and caused a 57 ± 3 % increase {{in the frequency of}} the spontaneous contractions of the uterus. The stimulatory effect of DaNa on the uterine musculature was not antagonized by atropine, methysergide or indomethacin.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the possibility that}} Ca 2 + released from intracellular stores could activate K+ currents underlying the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) in neurons. In neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the current underlying the AHP had two components: a rapidly decaying component that was maximal following the action potential (Gk(Ca, 1)) and a slower component that had a distinct rising phase (Gk(Ca, 2)). Both components required influx of extracellular Ca 2 + for their activation, and neither was blocked by extracellular TEA (10 mM). Gk(Ca, 1) was selectively blocked by apamin, whereas Gk(Ca, 2) was selectively reduced by noradrenaline. The time course of Gk(Ca, 2) was markedly temperature sensitive. Gk(Ca, 2) was selectively blocked by application of ryanodine or <b>sodium</b> <b>dantrolene,</b> or by loading cells with ruthenium red. These results suggest that influx of Ca 2 + directly gates one class of K+ channels and leads to release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores, which activates a different class of K+ channel...|$|R
40|$|Rats, anaesthetized with urethane, were {{injected}} intravenously with <b>dantrolene</b> <b>sodium</b> in {{a vehicle}} of 5 % mannitol taken to pH 10 with NaOH. The muscle relaxant action of <b>dantrolene</b> <b>sodium</b> was measured from the contractions of individual motor units of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL), soleus (SOL) and segmental tail (ST) muscles. Data were also collected from their parent whole muscle preparations. The depressant action of <b>dantrolene</b> <b>sodium</b> on the percentage-normalized amplitude of contraction of the individual motor units was greater than {{its effect on the}} whole muscle twitch amplitude, in all three muscles. The twitch amplitude of fast contracting motor units was significantly more reduced (P less than 0. 001) by <b>dantrolene</b> <b>sodium</b> than was that of slow contracting motor units. <b>Dantrolene</b> <b>sodium</b> reduced the contraction time of all motor units. The effect of the drug on half-relaxation time varied within and between groups of motor units studied. The drug was confirmed to have a greater depressant action on the twitch contraction than on the fused tetanus of whole muscle. This was true also for single motor units. With tetanic stimulation the effect of <b>dantrolene</b> <b>sodium</b> was also dependent upon the motor unit type, fast or slow. A maximum depression of contractile tension occurred at a stimulation frequency of 64 Hz for fast EDL motor units whereas the maximum depression for ST slow units, the slowest units tested, was at a stimulation frequency of 14 Hz...|$|E
40|$|In our study, {{effects of}} <b>dantrolene</b> <b>sodium</b> on glucose 6 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (G 6 PD) {{were examined in}} the human erythrocytes in vitro and in rat erythrocytes in vivo. Human erythrocyte G 6 PD was purified using ammonium sulfate fractionation and 2 ’, 5 ’-ADP Sepharose 4 B affinity chromatography. The enzyme activity was determined by Beutler’s method. The overall purification procedures gave the human G 6 PD having the specific activity of 97. 6 EU/mg of protein, which was purified 9760 -fold with a yield of 39 %. <b>Dantrolene</b> <b>sodium</b> inhibited the enzyme activity under in vitro conditions and the I value (drug concentration which produces 50 % inhibition) of this drug was 0. 91 mM.

40|$|Sepsis is the {{systemic}} inflammatory response resulting from serious infection {{and is the}} most common cause of death in intensive care units. Intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) is an important regulator of numerous cellular processes and when increased excessively may act as a potent cellular toxin. To determine if [Ca 2 +]i is responsible for the major metabolic changes which are hallmarks of sepsis, we examined if <b>sodium</b> <b>dantrolene,</b> a drug which decreases release of calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum, affected the metabolic abnormalities in plasma and epitrochlearis muscles of rats made septic by cecal ligation and perforation. Dantrolene when added in vitro or when given in vivo decreases many of the metabolic hallmarks of sepsis [...] i. e., muscle protein breakdown approximately 30 %, muscle glucose transport approximately 38 %, muscle lactate formation approximately 28 %, and plasma lactate approximately 29 % (P 2 -fold improvement in survival when it was administered concurrently with endotoxin (54 % vs. 20 % survival in dantrolene-treated and control mice, respectively (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Severe bloodstream-borne {{infection}} [...] i. e., sepsis [...] and {{the resulting}} multiorgan failure are now {{the most common cause}} of death in many intensive care units. One of the most fundamentally important and controversial issues concerning the pathophysiology of sepsis is the role of intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) in this disorder. Because of the critical role of calcium as an intracellular second messenger and as a potential cellular toxin, resolution of this issue is crucial. Using 19 F NMR spectroscopy and the calcium indicator 5, 5 '-difluoro-bis(2 -aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetate we demonstrate in the intact perfused organ, the rat thoracic aorta, that [Ca 2 +]i in aortic smooth muscle is increased > 2 -fold during sepsis. Furthermore, we determined that <b>sodium</b> <b>dantrolene,</b> a drug that decreases release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and that is lifesaving in malignant hyperthermia (a disorder due to increased [Ca 2 +]i), is able to reduce the elevated [Ca 2 +]i in sepsis to control values when added in vitro or when given in vivo to the animal. These results suggest that an increase in [Ca 2 +]i is an early event in sepsis and that increased [Ca 2 +]i may be responsible for, or contribute to, cellular injury. Dantrolene may offer a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of sepsis...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the binding}} of [3 H]ryanodine to liver microsomal subfractions was investigated. The {{specific}} binding of [3 H]ryanodine, as determined both by vacuum filtration and by ultracentrifugation, is {{to a single}} class of high-affinity binding sites with a Kd of 10 +/- 2. 5 nM and density of 500 +/- 100 and 1200 +/- 200 fmol/mg of protein by the filtration and centrifugation methods respectively. [3 H]Ryanodine binding reached equilibrium in about 1 min and 2 min at 36 degrees C and 24 degrees C respectively, and the half-time of dissociation at 37 degrees C was approx. 15 s. The binding of [3 H]ryanodine is Ca(2 +) -independent: it is slightly stimulated by NaCl, Mg 2 +, ATP and InsP 3 but strongly inhibited by caffeine, diltiazem and <b>sodium</b> <b>dantrolene.</b> Thus the binding of ryanodine to endoplasmic reticulum membranes shares some {{of the characteristics of}} its binding to the sarcoplasmic reticulum but also differs from it in several important properties, such as its Ca(2 +) -independence, its rapid association and dissociation, and its inhibition by caffeine. The structural similarities between the skeletal muscle and liver binding sites were further explored by employing in vitro DNA amplification techniques, using the known sequence of the skeletal muscle receptor as reference point.

40|$|Summary. Heavy sarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} vesicles de-rived {{from the}} terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum {{have been shown}} to contain endogenous protein kinase activity and associated substrate pro-teins. Heavy vesicles were phosphorylated at room temperature in 5 mM MgCl 2, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7. 4) and 10 µM γ- 32 P-ATP. 32 P-phosphoproteins were determined by sodium dodecyi sulphate gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. In the absence of ethylene glycol bis (β-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), there was little phosphorylation due to the high level of ATPase ac-tivity. Phosphorylation of three proteins of 64, 000 daltons (El), 42, 000 daltons (E 2), and 20, 000 daltons (E 3) was observed in the presence of 1 mM EGTA. Phosphorylation of these proteins was cAMP-inde-pendent, hydroxylamine-resistant, and was seen with-out the addition of protein kinase. In the presence ofHgCl 2 (2. 5 mM) or sodium deoxycholate (1 %) no protein phosphorylation was observed. Protein E 1 was heavily phosphorylated in the presence of 200 mM KCl, while its phosphorylation was inhibited by 20 µM <b>sodium</b> <b>dantrolene,</b> an inhibitor of Ca 2 + release.

In a solution made moderately hypertonic with 350 mM-sucrose, fibre contraction was effectively blocked and a secondary hump {{appeared in the}} decay phase of the 'on' part of charge movement. At small depolarizations, the hump (Q gamma) is small and slow. As depolarization is increased, Q gamma becomes larger in magnitude and faster in kinetics until it merges with {{the main part of}} charge movement (Q beta).
