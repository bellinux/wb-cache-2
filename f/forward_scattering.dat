25|$|The {{relatively}} flat {{phase curve}} of Venus {{is characteristic of}} a cloudy planet. In contrast to Mercury where the curve is strongly peaked approaching phase angle zero (full phase) that of Venus is rounded. The wide illumination scattering angle of clouds, {{as opposed to the}} narrower scattering of regolith, causes this flattening of the phase curve. Venus exhibits a brightness surge near phase angle 170°, when it is a thin crescent, due to <b>forward</b> <b>scattering</b> of sunlight by droplets of sulfuric acid that are above the planet's cloud tops. Even beyond 170° the brightness does not decline very steeply.|$|E

We show that flow cytometric {{measurement of the}} depolarization <b>forward</b> <b>scattered</b> light using a Brewster's Window Analyzer {{can be used to}} quantify the degree of calcification of coccolithophores at the single-cell level. Calcite-containing particles or cells were distinguished from non-calcified particles or cells by high values of <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> light with polarization orthogonal to that of the laser. <b>Forward</b> <b>scatter</b> polarization state varied strongly and linearly with the number of attached coccoliths per coccosphere when Emiliania huxleyi cells were first completely decalcified and then allowed to rebuild coccospheres. Cells of the heavily calcified E. huxleyi R-morphotype strain NZEH were also grown in different extracellular Ca 2 + concentrations, forming complete coccospheres that contained similar numbers of attached coccoliths but varied in total calcite mass. <b>Forward</b> <b>scatter</b> polarization state varied strongly and linearly with coccosphere calcite mass. In contrast, <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> polarization state of detached coccoliths did not vary significantly with calcite weight, although <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> and side scatter did. Treatments had relatively minor effects on <b>forward</b> <b>scatter,</b> side <b>scatter</b> and <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> polarization state of decalcified cells, suggesting that depolarization of <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> light from E. huxleyi cells might be linearly determined, to a first approximation, by the ratio of surface calcite to organic protoplast. We suggest that flow cytometric measurement of <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> depolarization provides a potentially valuable method for analysis of calcification state of individual cells...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFlow cytometry {{is a key}} {{instrument}} in biological studies, used to identify and analyze cells in suspension. The identification of cells from debris is commonly based on light scatter properties {{as it has been}} shown that there is a relationship between <b>forward</b> <b>scattered</b> light and cell volume and this has become common practice in flow cytometry. Cryobiological conditions induce changes in cells that alter their light scatter properties. Cells with membrane damage from freeze–thaw stress produce lower <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> signals and may fall below standard <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> thresholds. In contrast to light scatter properties that cannot identify damaged cells from debris, fluorescent dyes used in membrane integrity and mitochondrial polarization assays are capable of labeling and discriminating all cells in suspension. Under cryobiological conditions, isolating cell populations is more effectively accomplished by gating on fluorescence rather than light scatter properties. This study shows the limitations of using <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> thresholds in flow cytometry to identify and gate cells after exposure to a freeze–thaw protocol and demonstrates the use of fluorescence as an alternative means of identifying and analyzing cells...|$|R

30|$|Because of {{the special}} {{geometry}} of <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> radar, parameters (i.e., Dopplershift, azimuth angle, elevation angle) cannot directly be measured when the targetcrosses the baseline, resulting in a large estimation error and seriously decreasing thetracking precision. In addition, the detection area of <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> radar is a verynarrow region near the baseline where bistatic angle ranges from 135 ° to 180 °,indicating that target tracking is effectively implemented during {{a very short period}} oftime. Therefore, a stable tracking trajectory should be obtained before the targetcrosses the baseline, which requires fast convergence of filtering algorithm. However,the large error of initial state estimation will decrease the convergence speed, evenlead to filtering divergence. In summary, the initial state estimation is significantfor target tracking in <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> radar, which extremely affects the filteringaccuracy and convergence speed.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, numbers of {{research}} {{have been carried out}} to investigate the clutter characteristic especially for conventional monostatic and bistatic radar detection (mostly in maritime and airborne using Ultra Wide Band radar and Synthetic Aperture Radar) and not specifically on <b>Forward</b> <b>Scatter</b> Radar (FSR). FSR provides an efficient approach for detection of stealth target, the simplicity of the hardware design, increase the power budget and work in all weather operation. One of the limitations in <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> radar is the range resolution. Clutter mainly from the surrounding vegetation is picked up from a large area illuminated by transmitter and receiver which is located on the ground. Vegetation clutter is a significant factor that limits the performance of ground based <b>Forward</b> <b>Scatter</b> Radar. In this research, the analysis is focused on clutter on ground-based <b>Forward</b> <b>Scatter</b> Micro Radar system network where the clutter characteristics are studied for different environmental conditions such as different land sites, wind and weather conditions for different carrier frequencies.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the influence of exposure time and pupil size on a Shack-Hartmann (S/ H) derived metric of <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> (MAX_SD) using a physical model of nuclear cataract. METHODS: A physical model eye was developed and mounted to a S/H wavefront sensor. The eye model consisted of a lens, variable pupil, simulated cataract, and retina. Located behind the pupil, a cuvette contained one of five polystyrene microsphere solutions simulating five levels of nuclear cataract severity. Cataract severity was described using a S/H derived metric of <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> (MAX_SD), which measures aspects of <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> contained in the S/H lenslet point spread functions (PSF). To {{determine the}} impact of exposure time and pupil size, measurements of MAX_SD were regressed against cataract severity for three different exposure times and three different pupil sizes. RESULTS: MAX_SD was well correlated to cataract severity. Exposure time had the largest influence, and pupil size had the smallest influence on the <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> metric. When pupil size and exposure time were allowed to vary and image saturation was allowed to occur, MAX_SD explained 83 % of the variance in cataract severity. Excluding images where saturation occurred, holding optimal exposure time constant, and varying pupil size, MAX_SD explained 97 % of the variance in cataract severity. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of the <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> metric derived from S/H measurements to predict cataract severity for a longitudinal study is optimized by selecting a patient-specific exposure at the initial cataract assessment to avoid saturation and maximize the dynamic range of the system. This patient-specific exposure should be used in all future visits...|$|R

Eryptosis may be triggered by excessive hyperosmotic or isosmotic cell shrinkage leading to increase of cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration. Eryptosis is further stimulated by the K+ ionophore valinomycin, which leads to exit of KCl and osmotically obliged water, or by energy (glucose) depletion, which compromises {{the function of the}} Na+/K+ ATPase thus increasing cytosolic Na+ concentration. The present study explored whether the Na+ ionophore monensin affects erythrocyte cell volume and eryptosis.
