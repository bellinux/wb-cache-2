She was born in Nuku'alofa, the national capital, which lies on the primary Tongan island of Tongatapu. Po'uhila first {{participated in the}} Olympics at age 24, when she represented Tonga in shot put at the 2004 Athens games. She represented Tonga again in Beijing {{at the age of}} 32.

She bested this ranking on her second attempt when she lobbed it 16.42meters, ranking seventh amongst those who threw during the second try. Her third and final attempt, 16.35meters, did not beat her second attempt. Using her best mark, 16.42meters, Po'uhila placed 12th out of the 16 athletes who finished the event. She ranked ahead of Taiwan's Lin Chia-Ying (16.32meters) and behind Russia's Irina Khudoroshkina (16.84meters) in a heat led by China's Gong Lijiao (19.46meters) and Belarus' Nadzeya Ostapchuk (19.08meters).

25|$|Theosophy and spiritualism {{were both}} very popular metaphysical {{schools of thought}} {{especially}} in the early 20th century and thus were always clashing in their different beliefs. Madame Blavatsky was critical of spiritualism; she distanced theosophy from spiritualism as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could and allied herself with eastern occultism.|$|E

25|$|The time is 9.20pm. Sir Roger is {{enclosed}} {{in his study}} {{at the back of}} the hall. Dr. Sheppard was with him but Parker told Mrs. Ackroyd that he left earlier and, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> knows, Sir Roger is now alone. Flora follows her mother to bed and Raymond and Parker hear Sir Roger's voice coming from the other side of the door as he somewhat stiltedly tells an unknown person that he can give them no money as they require. Blunt enters from the terrace and he and Raymond go to the billiard room. Parker switches off the hall lights and leaves momentarily but re-enters a moment later to see Flora with her hand on the study door. She tells the butler that she has said goodnight to her uncle and that he doesn’t want to be disturbed. The two leave.|$|E

25|$|It {{is clear}} to Lizaveta Prokofyevna and General Yepanchin that their {{daughter}} {{is in love with}} the Prince, but Aglaya denies this and angrily dismisses talk of marriage. She continues to mock and reproach him, often in front of others, and lets slip that, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> is concerned, the problem of Nastassya Filippovna is yet to be resolved. Myshkin himself merely experiences an uncomplicated joy in her presence and is mortified when she appears to be angry with him. Lizaveta Prokofyevna feels it is time to introduce the Prince to their aristocratic circle and a dinner party is arranged for this purpose, to be attended by a number of eminent and influential persons. Aglaya, who does not share her parents' respect for these people and is afraid that Myshkin's eccentricity will not meet with their approval, tries to tell him how to behave, but ends by sarcastically telling him to be as eccentric as he likes, and to be sure to wave his arms about when he is pontificating on some high-minded subject and break her mother's priceless Chinese vase. Feeling her anxiety, Myshkin too becomes extremely anxious, but he tells her that it is nothing compared to the joy he feels in her company. He tries to approach the subject of Nastasya Filippovna again, but she silences him and hurriedly leaves.|$|E

25|$|Sir Roger’s sister-in-law, Mrs. Ackroyd, her daughter, Flora, his secretary, Geoffrey Raymond and Major Blunt, a guest, are {{relaxing}} in the hall. Mrs. Ackroyd and Flora live there {{due to their}} financial circumstances. They are utterly reliant on Sir Roger who tightly controls their money and consequently they are in some debt. They discuss {{a report in the}} newspaper of the suicide of a local woman, Mrs. Ashley Ferrars, during the previous night. She had a close relationship with Sir Roger and her death has greatly affected him. They further discuss the impending announcement of the engagement between Flora and Sir Roger’s stepson, Ralph Paton and the difference that this marriage will make. A young woman who is a neighbour, Caryl Sheppard, arrives to play bridge and Flora teases her over her fascination for a recent arrival in the village – a foreigner who Caryl thinks is called M. Porrott, but Flora reveals that her uncle has told her that he in fact is M. Hercule Poirot, the famous French detective. Poirot arrives and meets everyone. He is especially taken with Caryl. During the conversation, Caryl tells Flora that she thought she saw Ralph Paton in the village that morning but Flora is surprised – as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> knew Ralph has been in London for the previous six months ever since he had an argument with his uncle. As Caryl's brother, Dr. James Sheppard, is dining at Fernley that evening, she will be alone and she invites Poirot to dine with her. They leave together. As the others go off to change for dinner, a maid, Ursula Bourne, tidies the room and meets Ralph when he comes in from the terrace. It is obvious that the two have a secret relationship but their conversation is interrupted as Bourne sees Dr. Sheppard approaching the house. Ralph quickly hides in the adjoining library and Dr. Sheppard enters to be greeted by Parker, the butler. Dr. Sheppard may have to rush out to a confinement case later and consequently he has his doctor's bag with him which Parker looks after. Sheppard is left to his own devices for a moment and Ralph comes out of hiding and tells the doctor, an old friend, that he is in a mess with his stepfather and that he is staying at a local inn, the White Horse. Ralph leaves the house and soon Sir Roger himself comes down into the hall. He too unburdens himself on Sheppard: Mrs. Ferrars was going to be his fiancée after the year’s mourning for the late Mr. Ferrars came to an end but, when the requisite time was up, she hesitated for three more months and then confessed that she poisoned her brutal husband. She was driven to suicide by an unknown blackmailer who knew of her actions and has been draining her of funds all this time. Sir Roger is certain that she would have left him a letter detailing who her persecutor was. At that moment, Parker comes in with a letter for Sir Roger – it is from the late Mrs. Ferrars but he has no time to open it as the others come down for dinner.|$|E
500|$|After initial {{talks with}} actresses Kangana Ranaut and Bipasha Basu fell through, Vidya Balan {{was offered the}} lead role. When Balan was narrated the script and shown {{sketches}} of what she needed to wear for the portrayal, she felt uncomfortable. Luthria added, [...] "We couldn't have found anyone better than Vidya for this role. It's a casting that very few would think is viable because {{it is going to}} be nothing like Vidya has done before.

500|$|Smith {{agreed to}} return {{for a few days}} in 1988 to finish off Daphne's storyline. This time, the actress asked for her {{character}} to be killed off. Smith told Robyn Harvey from The Sydney Morning Herald, [...] "I wanted Daphne to die. I didn't want to be stuck in a television series {{for the rest of my}} life. I'd taken Daphne as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could go. She's run the gamut of every life experience she could possibly have. I'd had enough." [...] Daphne was critically injured during a car crash on the way to her father's funeral and she was left in a coma. Off-screen, representatives from the serial's production company tried to persuade Smith to sign a new contract, but she refused. Daphne briefly regained consciousness to say [...] "I love you Clarkey" [...] to Des, before becoming the first regular character to die.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the true}} {{identity}} of Archie's killer is kept a secret between Max and Stacey for several months, Max's daughter Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) becomes suspicious in November 2010 when Max tells her Bradley was innocent. Lauren suspects Max killed Archie as she becomes paranoid about his anger. Jossa {{said in an}} interview with website Digital Spy: [...] "'s thinking about Archie's murder and realising that if Bradley didn't do it, it must have been someone else. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> knows, her dad is the only person who knows that Bradley didn't do it, so she's trying to put this puzzle together and it's all adding up to Max being the killer, because everything he does seems to lead to a lot of aggression." [...] However, Lauren soon works out that Stacey is the murderer after speaking to her. Jossa said she was excited that her character was one of only a select few to know the true identity of Archie's killer.|$|E
500|$|The storyline {{continued}} throughout 1993 as Christine makes greater {{demands on}} Arthur, threatening to tell Pauline about their affair unless {{he does so}} himself. In September 1993, the situation finally reaches a climax on-screen. The scriptwriters had many conferences about ways in which Pauline would {{find out about the}} affair; [...] "should she work it out herself or should some third party tell her the truth?" [...] In the end it was felt that Arthur should tell her himself, and when he does, Pauline becomes violent and hits him in the face with a frying pan. Although the audience had witnessed Pauline and Arthur rowing many times, this was something different, [...] "an act of betrayal on a massive scale."

It's as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> can go without falling off the cliff of believability." [...] Dukes also described the song as a [...] "mini-movie", in which Underwood sings: [...] "And the preacher said {{he was a good man}} / And his brother said he was a good friend / But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry / Bye, bye / Yeah they took turns laying a rose down / Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground / He's not the only one who had a secret to hide / Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye."

She had participated in the {{previous}} two Olympic Games in Athens and Beijing.
