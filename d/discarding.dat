Bell began to write the script on January 2, 1999, a mere three weeks before pre-production was scheduled to begin. The episode ended up being re-written right up to the start of shooting on February 2.|$|E
5|$|Entanglement {{can result}} in {{mortality}} because when the seals get trapped in marine debris such as fishing nets they cannot maneuver or reach the surface to breathe. Marine fisheries can potentially interact with monk seals via direct and indirect relationships. Directly the seal can become snared by fishing equipment, entangled in discarded debris, and even feed on fish refuse. International law prohibits the intentional <b>discarding</b> of debris from ships at sea. Monk seals {{have one of the}} highest documented rates of entanglement of any pinniped species.|$|E
50|$|In many mahjong variants, <b>discards</b> {{are simply}} {{placed in the}} middle of the table in a disorganized fashion. However, with the Japanese variant, tiles are neatly placed in order of <b>discard</b> in front of each player. In turn, each player accumulates a <b>discard</b> pile, with each hand. Typically, <b>discards</b> are placed in rows of 6 tiles per {{customary}} rule. In addition, open calls for chii, pon, and kan have <b>discard</b> specific rules, by which they must indicate the source and type of <b>discarded</b> tile. This way, a record is maintained for all <b>discarded</b> tiles corresponding to each player. Likewise, game strategy depends on the state of the <b>discards</b> and the players' hands.|$|R
50|$|If West's {{cards are}} {{transferred}} to East, {{as shown in}} Example 2, the squeeze fails because the fourth condition above is not satisfied.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{focused on}} trash fish and <b>discards</b> in push nets operated by local fishermen twice during day time at Samuut Prakan Province in Thailand. The push net catch {{was divided into}} three categories: commercial fish, trash fish and <b>discards.</b> Total weight of the catch, and body length and weight of the species were measured in each category. A survey of fishing gears and methods {{was carried out by}} interviewing fishermen. The catch was divided into <b>discards</b> (54 % of total weight), commercial fish (23 %) and trash fish (23 %). Almost 80 % of the <b>discards</b> were crabs, Charybdis affinis, while soapy, Leiognathus sp. accounted for 69 % of trash fish. In trash fish and <b>discards,</b> juveniles of commercial species were included, while almost all of soapy in trash fish were adults on their mean length. The <b>discards</b> ratio (= <b>discards</b> /landing) was 1. 17, and <b>discard</b> rate [= <b>discards</b> / (landing + <b>discards)</b> ] was 0. 54. ...|$|R

40|$|Monitoring {{live and}} dead <b>discarded</b> catch {{contributes}} to effective fisheries management and ecological and socioeconomic sustainability. We determined contemporary rates {{and levels of}} <b>discards</b> in global tuna fisheries. An estimated 265 279 t (52 283 to 478 275 t 95 % CI) is annually <b>discarded</b> by global tuna fisheries, composing about 5 % {{of the weight of}} the total catch. Pelagic longline and purse seine fisheries contributed about 64 and 36 % of <b>discards,</b> respectively. Other gear types composed < 1 % of <b>discards.</b> <b>Discards</b> in tuna fisheries are now 63 % lower than estimated 1 decade earlier, mainly due to large declines in <b>discards</b> in longline tuna fisheries, possibly from increased retention of formerly <b>discarded</b> species and sizes of catch and increased gear selectivity. The decline also resulted, in part, from employing different methods to categorize caught sharks whose fins were retained and carcasses <b>discarded</b> following processing. <b>Discard</b> rates were greater in shallow-than deep-set longline fisheries, and higher in purse seine sets associated with fish aggregating devices and other floating objects than in other purse seine set types. The quality and availability of data on <b>discards</b> in global tuna fisheries were extremely limited. Filling gaps in monitoring, improving observer data fields and collection protocols, and providing public access to amalgamated <b>discard</b> data held by fisheries management organizations will improve the certainty of future <b>discard</b> estimates, supporting effective management of <b>discards</b> in global tuna fisheries...|$|R

5|$|New classicals {{broke with}} Keynesian {{economic}} theory completely while monetarists had built on Keynesian ideas. Despite <b>discarding</b> Keynesian theory, new classical economists did share the Keynesian focus on explaining short-run fluctuations. New classicals replaced monetarists {{as the primary}} opponents to Keynesianism and changed the primary debate in macroeconomics from whether to look at short-run fluctuations to whether macroeconomic models should be grounded in microeconomic theories.

5|$|Over {{a century}} later, there are {{records of the}} walls being {{repaired}} in the 1520s and 1530s by Henry VIII {{in preparation for a}} potential royal visit, but the ascension of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne had heralded a change in the way Wales was administered. The Tudors were Welsh in origin, and their rule eased hostilities between the Welsh and English. The military importance of Conwy's defences declined and the townspeople used the walls' defensive ditches for <b>discarding</b> rubbish. Parts of the town walls were robbed for their stone during this period for use in the construction of local buildings.|$|E
40|$|Nephrops norvegicus (Norway lobster or prawn) is an {{important}} target species in demersal fisheries of the north-east Atlantic. Trawling for Nephrops is wasteful when many small fish are caught and <b>discarded</b> in the process. Here, data from 106 commercial fishing trips, sampled between 1982 and 1998 {{as part of the}} Scottish <b>discard</b> sampling programme, are used to investigate the fish bycatch and <b>discards</b> of Nephrops trawlers in the Firth of Clyde (west of Scotland). A large proportion of the fish caught in the Clyde is <b>discarded,</b> the <b>discards</b> mainly consisting of small demersal fish (mean length about 19 cm), particularly young whiting (Merlangius merlangus). Within the study period, annual estimates of total fish <b>discards</b> ranged from 318 to 3 027 tonnes, with a mean of 1 761 tonnes. Fish landings and <b>discards</b> biomass per unit effort both decreased over the study period. However, the decline in landings per unit effort was greater than that in <b>discards</b> per unit effort, corresponding to an increase in the <b>discard</b> rate over time. In recent years, <b>discards</b> have comprised about 70 % of the fish bycatch. The mean length of <b>discarded</b> fish was positively related to mesh size...|$|R

5|$|Protein {{structures}} have to {{be represented}} in some coordinate-independent space to make them comparable. This is typically achieved by constructing a sequence-to-sequence matrix or series of matrices that encompass comparative metrics: rather than absolute distances relative to a fixed coordinate space. An intuitive representation is the distance matrix, which is a two-dimensional matrix containing all pairwise distances between some subset of the atoms in each structure (such as the alpha carbons). The matrix increases in dimensionality {{as the number of}} structures to be simultaneously aligned increases. Reducing the protein to a coarse metric such as secondary structure elements (SSEs) or structural fragments can also produce sensible alignments, despite the loss of information from <b>discarding</b> distances, as noise is also discarded. Choosing a representation to facilitate computation is critical to developing an efficient alignment mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Lehuby's company readied a ship at Le Havre {{and began}} to gather French emigrants, of whom about 30 {{obtained}} passports to travel to Poyais. <b>Discarding</b> the idea of co-operation with Spain, MacGregor published a new Poyaisian constitution in Paris in August 1825, this time describing it as a republic—he remained head of state, with the title Cazique—and on 18 August raised a new £300,000 loan through Thomas Jenkins & Company, an obscure London bank, offering 2.5% interest per annum. No evidence survives {{to suggest that the}} relevant bonds were issued. The Sketch was condensed and republished as a 40-page booklet called Some Account of the Poyais Country. French government officials became suspicious when an additional 30 people requested passports to travel to this country they had never heard of, and ordered the Nouvelle Neustrie company's ship to be kept in port. Some of the would-be emigrants became concerned themselves and made complaints to the police, which led to the arrest of Hippisley and MacGregor's secretary Thomas Irving in Paris in the early hours on 4 September 1825. Lehuby's ship never left Le Havre, and his colonists gradually dispersed.|$|E

40|$|Fishery <b>discards</b> subsidise {{the food}} supply of a large {{community}} of scavenging seabirds, thus substantially influencing seabird ecology. Seabird preference for certain types of <b>discards</b> determines the number and composition of <b>discards</b> available for non-avian marine scavengers. To quantify both portions of <b>discards</b> temporally as well as spatially, {{we have used a}} modelling framework that integrates the spatial and temporal variation in seabird distribution, seabird attraction to fishing vessels, and <b>discard</b> distribution. The framework was applied to a case study in the Bay of Biscay, where a wide variation in <b>discard</b> consumption was observed across seabird foraging guilds, <b>discard</b> types, periods, and locations. Seabirds removed about one-quarter of the Bay of Biscay <b>discards.</b> The remaining sinking <b>discards</b> have limited potential to subsidize scavenging benthic communities on a large scale, but they may contribute substantially to scavenger diets on a local scale. Changes in food subsidies caused by <b>discard</b> mitigation measures, such as the “landing obligation” in the European Common Fisheries Policy, are likely to have ecosystem effects on both scavenging seabirds and non-avian marine scavengers...|$|R
