5|$|The {{defining}} {{dynamic characteristic}} of a planet is that it <b>has</b> <b>cleared</b> its neighborhood. A planet that <b>has</b> <b>cleared</b> its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the planetesimals in its orbit. In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects. This characteristic was mandated {{as part of the}} IAU's official definition of a planet in August, 2006. This criterion excludes such planetary bodies as Pluto, Eris and Ceres from full-fledged planethood, making them instead dwarf planets. Although to date this criterion only applies to the Solar System, a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs.|$|E

5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} the few New Zealand {{forest trees}} that can recover from fire. It can renew its trunk from buds on the {{protected}} rhizomes under the ground. This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire has eliminated competing plants. Cabbage tree leaves contain oils which make them burn readily. The same oils may also slow down the decay of fallen leaves, so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating. When the leaves do break down, they form a fertile soil around the tree. Cabbage tree seed also has a store of oil, which means it remains viable for several years. When a bushfire <b>has</b> <b>cleared</b> the land of vegetation, cabbage tree seeds germinate in great numbers to make the most of the light and space opened up by the flames.|$|E

25|$|The longest-acting {{barbiturates}} have half-lives {{of a day}} or more, {{and subsequently}} result in bioaccumulation of the drug in the system. The therapeutic and recreational effects of long-acting barbiturates wear off significantly faster than the drug can be eliminated, allowing the drug to reach toxic concentrations in the blood following repeated administration (even when taken at the therapeutic/prescribed dose) despite the user feeling little or no effects from the plasma-bound concentrations of the drug. Users who consume alcohol or other sedatives after the drugs effects have worn but before it <b>has</b> <b>cleared</b> the system may experience a greatly exaggerated effect from the other sedatives which can be incapacitating or even fatal.|$|E
25|$|ARJ21-700 AC104 of Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, Ltd. (COMAC) {{returned}} to China safely on April 28, 2014 after successfully completing natural icing flight testing in North America. This {{was the first}} time a turbofan-powered regional jet independently developed by China had flown abroad to carry out flight tests in special weather conditions. In the meantime, the fleet of ARJ21-700 test aircraft has achieved a global flight log of more than 30,000km across Asia, America, Europe, and the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. This success of the ARJ21-700 in natural icing flight testing <b>has</b> <b>cleared</b> another obstacle toward airworthiness certification, and proven access and feasibility for China’s civil aircraft to carry out flight testing abroad.|$|E
25|$|If {{another team}} signs a {{released}} player {{who had a}} guaranteed contract (as long as the player <b>has</b> <b>cleared</b> waivers), the player's original team is allowed {{to reduce the amount}} of money they still owe the player (and lower their team payroll) by the right of set-off. This is true if the player signs with any professional team—it does not even have to be an NBA team. The amount the original team gets to set off is limited to one-half the difference between the player's new salary and a pro-rated share of the minimum salary for a one-year veteran (if the player is a rookie, then the rookie minimum is used instead).|$|E

25|$|Much of Indonesia's {{deforestation}} {{is caused}} by forest clearing for the palm oil industry, which <b>has</b> <b>cleared</b> 18 million hectares of forest for palm oil expansion. This requires land reallocation as well as changes to the local and natural ecosystems. Palm oil expansion can generate wealth for local communities, {{but it can also}} degrade ecosystems and cause social problems. This makes Indonesia the world's fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Such activity also threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species, including 140 species of mammals identified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as threatened, and 15 identified as critically endangered, including the Bali starling, Sumatran orangutan, and Javan rhinoceros.|$|E
25|$|For {{industrial}} development, the NDA government <b>has</b> <b>cleared</b> a {{total of}} 135 proposals worth Rs 71,289.64 crore, submitted by big entrepreneurs for setting up medium and large industries. The proposals are related to sugar mills, ethanol, engineering and medical colleges and power production in the state. A sum of Rs 602.54 crore had already been spent on various activities pertaining to the cleared projects, which are likely to create job opportunities for over 114,000 people. The proposals include opening of 23 new sugar mills {{and the expansion of}} seven existing ones, apart from the production of ethanol in two sugar mills and five sugarcane juice production plants. The projects regarding five power plants, 12 food-processing units and 15 steel-processing and cement plants have also been cleared by the state.|$|E
25|$|The city of Detroit {{and other}} private-public {{partnerships}} {{have attempted to}} catalyze the region's growth by facilitating the building and historical rehabilitation of residential high-rises in the downtown, creating a zone that offers many business tax incentives, creating recreational spaces such as the Detroit RiverWalk, Campus Martius Park, Dequindre Cut Greenway, and Green Alleys in Midtown. The city itself <b>has</b> <b>cleared</b> sections of land while retaining a number of historically significant vacant buildings in order to spur redevelopment; though it has struggled with finances, the city issued bonds in 2008 to provide funding for ongoing work to demolish blighted properties. Two years earlier, downtown reported $1.3billion in restorations and new developments which {{increased the number of}} construction jobs in the city. In the decade prior to 2006, downtown gained more than $15billion in new investment from private and public sectors.|$|E

Sinead then {{gives birth to}} her baby Katy which Diane initially adopts although Sinead then wants the baby and moves in with drug-dealer Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson). Sinead then starts drug-dealing and is reported to social services. Tony accuses Diane of reporting Sinead and is furious with her. He then moves in with Cindy. Diane later finds out about Tony's cancer, however, and Tony and Diane then re-unite with Tony moving back in with Diane. In October 2013, Tony and Diane decide {{to go to the}} seaside the day that Tony will get the news about whether his cancer <b>has</b> <b>cleared</b> or not. Tony and Diane discover that they met when they were children at the same seaside they are at now. Diane suddenly goes in to labor and she is rushed to the hospital. Tony's phone frequently rings as he is about to be told the news about his cancer, although he refuses to pick up as he wants to see Diane give birth to their children first. Diane gives birth to a boy named Anthony (the name Diane knew Tony as when they met as children) and Dee Dee (the name Tony knew Diane as). After this, Tony picks up his phone and is thrilled when he is told that his cancer has been cleared.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, {{the haze}} {{returned}} again in late September when Muslim Malaysians were experiencing Ramadan. This was {{partly due to}} a change of wind direction towards the southwest, partially caused by Typhoon Xangsane. The worst hit place was Kuching. The Sarawak state government had declared that schools would close if the API breaches the 300 mark. The worst affected area in Peninsular Malaysia is Johor Bahru which recorded an API of 150 on 7 and 8 October. For now, many people are wearing masks to prevent themselves from inhaling excessive amounts of haze. On 7 October, visibility in parts of East Malaysia fell to 300metres. On or about 9 October, {{the worst of the}} haze in Peninsular seemed to be in the state of Negeri Sembilan, where visibility in Sepang fell briefly to 500metres and the API in Nilai reached 198, before the rain relieved the haze partially. Shortly thereafter changing winds caused conditions to improve rapidly. Sarawak has started cloud seeding attempts to try to encourage rainfall that will help relieve the haze. Each cloud seeding session costs at least RM50,000 (roughly US$14,000). On 21 October, the winds has changed direction and started to blow the hazes away from Malaysia, and the following day, heavy rain <b>has</b> <b>cleared</b> the haze. Later on 26 October, the heavy rain returned again, and there were isolated showers in Klang Valley. The Star reported that the hazy days are soon coming to an end as the monsoon season is approaching.|$|E
