To {{the best of our}} knowledge, there are no design guidelines that exist for concrete scales despite their common use in communication, educational, and decision-making settings. We attempt to fill this void by introducing a novel framework that would serve as a practical guide for their analysis and design.

In addition, the paper simulates the path of dynamic provisions under the formulas used in Spain, Peru and Bolivia, showing that the alternative paths diverge significantly from the actual buildup and in part better conform to the Uruguayan credit cycle.

40|$|Includes bibliographyIntroduction It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that the adoption of internationally recognized standards, or codes of good practices, can help to improve economic policy-making and strengthen the <b>international</b> <b>financial</b> system. The <b>international</b> <b>financial</b> community has relied on the International Monetary Fund (IMF); and other standard setting agencies to develop standards/codes covering a number of economic and financial areas, including data dissemination, fiscal, monetary and financial policy transparency, banking regulation and supervision, securities and insurance regulation, accounting, auditing, bankruptcy and corporate governance. Over the past four decades, several examples abound where the <b>international</b> <b>financial</b> institutions have played the lead role in the formulation and monitoring of standards for statistical development. Some of the more common examples where member countries follow internationally recognized standards and guidelines include the publication, by the IMF, of Manuals for Money and <b>Financial</b> <b>Statistics,</b> Balance of Payments and External Debt Statistics and Government Finance Statistics; the System of National Accounts Manual (Latest Edition: 1993); prepared jointly by the United Nations, IMF, World Bank, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); and the European Union (EU);; and the setting of standards by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision. The General Data Dissemination System (GDDS); was introduced by the IMF to assist countries {{in the development of}} their overall statistical systems. This system is part of an initiative that aims to develop a set of standards that could guide member countries in their production and dissemination of economic data. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review the implications and implementation of the GDDS in the English-speaking Caribbean.

The IFS calculates CPI based on prices in 17 capital cities; this paper will use 2007 as the base year. We use real monthly wages, and net monthly profits for self-employed respondents, as income. If monthly income is not available, we use annual wages divided by 12 and annual profits divided by 12 for self-employed respondents. Hours per year is constructed based on normal hours worked multiplied by weeks worked. Real hourly wages is constructed using annual income divided by hours worked.

40|$|Successive {{episodes of}} {{financial}} crises {{raise the question}} of whether <b>international</b> <b>financial</b> law is insufficiently robust to support global <b>financial</b> stability. <b>International</b> <b>financial</b> law can be characterized today as a set of “soft law” rules and standards adopted voluntarily and differentially by individual states and lacking any real international enforcement mechanism. The pre- 2009 system of <b>international</b> <b>financial</b> regulation failed to check financial excesses in globalized financial markets. Liberalization and globalization led to under-regulation accompanied by lack of accountability mechanisms and brought the failure of <b>international</b> <b>financial</b> institutions and systemic instability. The crisis that commenced in 2008 -the most severe blow to the <b>international</b> <b>financial</b> system since 1929 -calls for a fundamental re-design of regulatory standards, financial risk prevention and management mechanism and the <b>international</b> <b>financial</b> architecture. This study argues that a hard-law based <b>international</b> <b>financial</b> law (based on the enforcement of regulations) is essential for maintaining global financial stability as the existing soft-law based financial regulatory architecture failed not only to prevent and manage the crisis in 2008 but also in checking those financial excesses committed by the de-regulatory and liberal regimes which threatened global financial stability, the discipline of <b>international</b> <b>financial</b> law and its regulatory institutions. This study thus argues that a law-based enforcement mechanism for <b>international</b> <b>financial</b> regulation is essential for global financial stability. This research questions the fundamental basis of the existing <b>international</b> <b>financial</b> architecture (soft law) and explores the need for a compliance-based model (based on legitimacy of regulations and accountability of the regulatory bodies) in the <b>international</b> <b>financial</b> system. In so doing, this thesis proposes fundamental changes and alternative perspectives to the existing framework of <b>international</b> <b>financial</b> law which is in need of a fundamental re-design as has been proved by recurring episodes of financial disruptions. published_or_final_versionLawDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
