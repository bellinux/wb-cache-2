Serving as a landmark record in the era of <b>hip</b> <b>hop</b> known as the East Coast Renaissance, its influence helped lead the way for several other East Coast <b>hip</b> <b>hop</b> artists, including Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., Mobb Deep, and Jay-Z.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, there were popular <b>hip</b> <b>hop</b> songs, and the celebrities of the scene, like LL Cool J, gained mainstream renown.

They became even more widely popular during the mid-2000s due to the rise of Southern <b>hip</b> <b>hop</b> rap and the more mainstream pop culture status <b>hip</b> <b>hop</b> attained.|$|E

5|$|The use of melisma, {{a gospel}} {{tradition}} adapted by vocalists Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey {{would become a}} cornerstone of contemporary R singers {{beginning in the late}} 1980s and throughout the 1990s. <b>Hip</b> <b>hop</b> came to influence contemporary R later in the 1980s, first through new jack swing and then in a related series of subgenres called <b>hip</b> <b>hop</b> soul and neo soul. <b>Hip</b> <b>hop</b> soul and neo soul developed later, in the 1990s. Typified by the work of Mary J. Blige and R. Kelly, the former is a mixture of contemporary R with <b>hip</b> <b>hop</b> beats, while the images and themes of gangsta rap may be present. The latter is a more experimental, edgier, and generally less mainstream combination of 1960s and 1970s-style soul vocals with some <b>hip</b> <b>hop</b> influence, and has earned some mainstream recognition through the work of D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys, and Lauryn Hill. D'Angelo's critically acclaimed album Voodoo (2000) has been recognized by music writers as a masterpiece and the cornerstone of the neo soul genre.|$|E
