5|$|In late 1994, {{following}} the 1994 Congressional elections which switched Congress <b>from</b> <b>Democratic</b> to Republican control, the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, chaired by Pennsylvania Republican William Clinger, launched {{an investigation into}} the White House Travel Office firings. In October 1995, the committee began hearings on the matter; Clinger soon accused the White House of withholding pertinent documents and sought subpoenas to compel witnesses to appear.|$|E
5|$|No {{sooner had}} Bryan left the state than Governor Bradley {{reversed}} course and began stumping for Taylor. Though he insisted he {{only wanted to}} defend his administration <b>from</b> <b>Democratic</b> attacks, Louisville Courier-Journal editor Henry Watterson suggested that Bradley was seeking to enlist Taylor's support for his anticipated senatorial bid. Bradley kicked off his tour {{of the state in}} Louisville, charging that Democrats had to import an orator for their candidate because all of the state's best men had deserted him. As evidence, he cited Goebel's lack of support from Democrat John G. Carlisle, his former ally, as well as Senator William Lindsay, W. C. P. Breckinridge, John Y. Brown, Theodore Hallum, W. C. Owens, Wat Hardin, and William Stone. He also encouraged blacks not to desert the Republican Party. He contrasted his appointments of blacks to his cabinet with the Democrats' support of the Separate Coach Bill. Bradley and Republican leader (and later governor) Augustus E. Willson toured the state on behalf of the Republican ticket, often drawing crowds larger than those assembled for Taylor.|$|E
5|$|On April 12, 2015, Clinton {{formally}} {{announced her}} candidacy {{for the presidency}} in the 2016 election. She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure. The campaign's headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Focuses of her campaign included raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool and making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act. Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination, Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge <b>from</b> <b>democratic</b> socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton's Wall Street ties.|$|E

5|$|Dennis Showalter, {{writing in}} 1975, defended Starship Troopers, {{stating that the}} society {{depicted}} in it did not contain many elements of fascism. He argues that the novel does not include outright opposition to bolshevism and liberalism that would be expected in a fascist society. Others have responded by saying Showalter's argument {{is based on a}} literal reading of the novel, and that the story glorifies militarism to a large extent. Ken Macleod argues that the book does not actually advocate fascism because anybody capable of understanding the oath of Federal Service is able to enlist and thereby obtain political power. Macleod states that Heinlein's books are consistently liberal, but cover a spectrum <b>from</b> <b>democratic</b> to elitist forms of liberalism, Starship Troopers being on the latter end of the spectrum. It has been argued that Heinlein's militarism is more libertarian than fascist, and that this trend is also present in Heinlein's other popular books of the period, such as Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (1966). This period of Heinlein's writing has received more critical attention than any other, though he continued to write into the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|In August 2001, {{the lucrative}} Philadelphia Parking Authority {{was taken over}} by the Pennsylvania {{government}} in a compromise designed to help the Philadelphia School District out of its fiscal crisis.

25|$|Historians {{often use}} 1979-80 to date a {{philosophical}} realignment within the American electorate away <b>from</b> <b>Democratic</b> liberalism and toward Reagan Era conservatism. However, some liberals hold a minority view {{that there was}} no real shift and that Kennedy's defeat was merely by historical accident caused by his poor campaign, international crises and Carter's use of the incumbency.|$|E

Buckley finished third with 13.4% of the vote, possibly having inadvertently aided Lindsay's election by instead taking votes <b>from</b> <b>Democratic</b> candidate Abe Beame.|$|E

25|$|Following Labour's {{victory in}} the 1997 general election, the Conservative Party opposed Labour's {{decision}} to grant the Bank of England independent control of interest rates–on {{the grounds that it}} would be a prelude to the abolition of the pound sterling and acceptance of the European single currency, and also expressed concern over the removal of monetary policy <b>from</b> <b>democratic</b> control. However, Bank independence was popular amongst the financial community as it helped to keep inflation low. The Conservatives accepted Labour's policy in early 2000.|$|E
25|$|White Republicans {{as well as}} Democrats {{solicited}} black votes but reluctantly rewarded blacks with {{nominations for}} office only when necessary, even then reserving the more choice positions for whites. The results were predictable: these half-a-loaf gestures satisfied neither black nor white Republicans. The fatal weakness of the Republican Party in Alabama, as elsewhere in the South, was its inability to create a biracial political party. And while in power even briefly, they failed to protect their members <b>from</b> <b>Democratic</b> terror. Alabama Republicans were forever on the defensive, verbally and physically.|$|E

25|$|Chenoweth faced {{a strong}} {{challenge}} in 1996 <b>from</b> <b>Democratic</b> activist Dan Williams, but was reelected {{in a close}} contest—most likely helped by Bob Dole easily carrying the 1st in the presidential election. Chenoweth defeated Williams again in 1998 by a wider margin. She later said that she regretted limiting herself to three terms and called {{the whole concept of}} term limits bad policy. She nonetheless honored her pledge and did not run for reelection to a fourth term in 2000. She was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Butch Otter, a fellow Republican. Since her retirement, no women have represented Idaho in either house of Congress.|$|E
25|$|As an independent, Sanders {{worked out}} {{a deal with the}} Senate Democratic {{leadership}} in which he agreed to vote with the Democrats on all procedural matters, except with permission <b>from</b> <b>Democratic</b> Whip Dick Durbin (a request that is rarely made or granted). In return, he was allowed to keep his seniority and received the committee seats that would have been available to him as a Democrat; in 2013–14, he was chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs (during the Veterans Health Administration scandal). Sanders was free to vote as he pleased on policy matters, but almost always voted with the Democrats.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, Cramer {{switched}} his partisan affiliation <b>from</b> <b>Democratic</b> to Republican at {{the urging}} of his law partner, Herman Goldner. He later was elected as mayor of St. Petersburg. At the time, statewide voter registration in Florida was some fourteen-to-one Democratic, largely because of disenfranchisement of African Americans as voters {{since the turn of the}} century by discriminatory application of the state constitution and subsequent laws. They had comprised the majority of the Republican Party at that time. The party was hollowed out in the state and across the South, as all the other states also achieved disenfranchisement of African Americans, which withstood early court challenges.|$|E

25|$|Early in August 1918, mere {{months after}} the November 1917 Bolshevik Revolution which brought the Communist Party to power in Russia, European Marxist Karl Kautsky {{published}} an oppositional political tract charging the Bolsheviks with fomenting civil war due to their failure to uphold the norms of universal suffrage. Kautsky's pamphlet, Die Diktatur des Proletariats (The Dictatorship of the Proletariat), asserted {{that the only way}} to control the growth of bureaucracy and militarism and to defend the rights of political dissidents was through parliamentary democracy based upon free elections and that V. I. Lenin and his political associates had blundered badly by departing <b>from</b> <b>democratic</b> practice in favor of a restricted electorate and the use of extra-parliamentary force.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of McDonald's wife Leacy Anne on February 3, 1843, he {{increased}} his participation and involvement in political activities. In keeping with the Virginia law requiring citizens to own a particular amount of land in order to exercise their right of suffrage, McDonald transferred tracts of land of the requisite amount of acres to young men belonging to the Whig Party to enable their vote in elections that McDonald was {{particularly interested in the}} outcome of. McDonald's maneuver made him many enemies in the opposing Democratic Party, and when he requested permission <b>from</b> <b>Democratic</b> United States President James K.
