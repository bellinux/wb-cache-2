The Ottawa Citizen endorsed Baird <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>campaign,</b> {{and argued that}} his political judgment had improved considerably since his tenure as a Harris cabinet minister. In December 2006 Baird was one of thirteen Conservative MPs who voted against reopening the national debate on same-sex marriage.|$|E
5|$|The Campaign of William Wallace {{acts as a}} {{tutorial}} campaign, {{much like}} the original Age of Empires game, and emphasises on how to move units, collect and gather resources, obtain and store holy relics and defeat the enemy, which <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>Campaign</b> is presented as the English during the Wars of Scottish Independence, commanded by the evil, torturous but skilled commander Edward Longshanks.|$|E
5|$|Australian troops {{arrived in}} Greece during March and manned {{defensive}} {{positions in the}} north of the country alongside British, New Zealand and Greek units. The outnumbered Allied force was not able to halt the Germans when they invaded on 6April and was forced to retreat. The Australians and other Allied units conducted a fighting withdrawal from their initial positions and were evacuated from southern Greece between 24April and 1May. Australian warships also formed part of the force which protected the evacuation and embarked hundreds of soldiers from Greek ports. The 6thDivision suffered heavy casualties <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>campaign,</b> with 320men killed and 2,030 captured.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} there were 600 ships in the Persian fleet, {{provided}} by the Phoenicians (who were most eager to fight), the Egyptians, Cilicians, and the Cypriots, whose own revolt had recently been subdued. The Persian fleet may have been commanded by the veteran Median general Datis; Persian records {{seem to suggest that}} he was sent by Darius to Ionia at around about the time of Lade. However, Herodotus does not name any Persian commanders <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>campaign.</b>|$|E
5|$|Muhammad {{also sent}} Khalid on an {{expedition}} to Dumatul Jandal, to attack the Christian Prince Ukaydir {{who lived in a}} castle there. This took place in March 631 AD, 9AH,11th month of the Islamic Calendar. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>campaign,</b> Khaled took the Prince hostage and threatened to kill him until the door of the castle was opened. Muhammad then later ransomed him in exchange for 2000 camels, 800 sheep, 400 sets of armour, 400 lances, and a pledge to pay Jizyah.|$|E
5|$|The {{action was}} the first of two <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>campaign</b> in which lone British frigates were briefly {{overwhelmed}} by superior French forces as they sailed independently to join Rowley's squadron. On each occasion however, Rowley was able to recapture the lost frigate and drive off the French attackers. Corbet's action was particularly violent, British casualties totalling 49 killed and 114 wounded, including every single officer and all but three of the soldiers embarked. Africaine was seriously damaged and would not be ready to return to active service for some months. French losses were less severe, Astrée suffering one killed and two wounded, Iphigénie nine killed and 33 wounded.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle was}} a blow for the French {{defenders}} of Martinique, who were isolated from France and suffering from shortages {{of military and}} food supplies. Although another supply frigate broke through the blockade and arrived in December 1808, the island was surrounded by British bases and was invaded and captured in January 1809. Other French colonies were seized {{over the next two}} years as the blockade cut off French communications with their overseas territories. Amethyst and her captain Michael Seymour were active <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>campaign,</b> capturing a second French frigate, Niémen, at the Action of 6 April 1809.|$|E
5|$|The first campaign, in 492 BC, {{was led by}} Darius's {{son-in-law}} Mardonius, who re-subjugated Thrace, {{which had}} nominally {{been part of the}} Persian empire since 513 BC. Mardonius was also able to force Macedon to become a fully subordinate client kingdom of Persia; it had previously been a vassal, but retained a broad degree of autonomy. However, further progress <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>campaign</b> was prevented when Mardonius's fleet was wrecked in a storm off the coast of Mount Athos. Mardonius himself was then injured in a raid on his camp by a Thracian tribe, and after this he returned {{with the rest of the}} expedition to Asia.|$|E
5|$|While Philip was {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>campaign,</b> his allies the Acarnanians {{became involved in}} a war against Athens after the Athenians murdered two Acarnanian athletes. The Acarnanians complained to Philip about this provocation, {{and he decided to}} send a force under the command of Nicanor the Elephant to assist them in their attack on Attica. The Macedonians and their allies plundered and looted Attica before attacking Athens. The invaders made it as far as the Academy of Athens when the Roman ambassadors in the city ordered the Macedonians to retreat or to face war with Rome.|$|E

5|$|World War II in Europe {{began on}} Friday 1 September 1939, when German forces invaded Poland. Lützow did not {{participate}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>campaign.</b> He was tasked with providing fighter protection for Berlin. From the Jagdfliegerschule in Werneuchen, he detached two squadrons and placed them {{under the command of}} Jagdgruppe 20 based at Strausberg. At the end of October 1939, a change in command of I. Gruppe (1st group) of Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG3—3rd Fighter Wing) was announced. The former commander Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant Colonel) Otto-Heinrich von Houwald was transferred to the Jagdfliegerschule in Werneuchen. Lützow joined I. Gruppe on 1 November 1939, officially taking over command as Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) two days later.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{focused his}} {{political}} agenda on promoting virtue, which he considered essential {{in a republican}} government. If republican leaders lacked virtue, he believed, liberty was endangered. His major opponent <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>campaign</b> was his former protégé John Hancock; {{the two men had}} a falling out in the Continental Congress. Adams disapproved of what he viewed as Hancock's vanity and extravagance, which Adams believed were inappropriate in a republican leader. When Hancock left Congress in 1777, Adams and the other Massachusetts delegates voted against thanking him for his service as president of Congress. The struggle continued in Massachusetts. Adams thought that Hancock was not acting the part of a virtuous republican leader by acting like an aristocrat and courting popularity. Adams favored James Bowdoin for governor, and was distressed when Hancock won annual landslide victories.|$|E
5|$|Australian troops {{arrived in}} Greece during March and manned {{defensive}} {{positions in the}} north of the country alongside British, New Zealand and Greek units. Perth also formed part of the naval force which protected the Allied troop convoys travelling to Greece and participated in the Battle of Cape Matapan in late March. The outnumbered Allied force was not able to halt the Germans when they invaded on 6 April and was forced to retreat. The Australians and other Allied units conducted a fighting withdrawal from their initial positions and were evacuated from southern Greece between 24 April and 1 May.

5|$|In the Battle of Britain, Mayer often {{flew over}} the English Channel as the wingman of Helmut Wick. He claimed three further {{victories}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>campaign,</b> all over Royal Air Force (RAF) Supermarine Spitfires, but was himself shot down or forced to land at the French Coast. Once he had to swim in the Channel for an hour before he was rescued. At the end of 1940 Mayer had four victories to his credit and JG2 was withdrawn from combat to replenish the heavy losses it had sustained. Following a short tour as fighter pilot instructor at the Jagdfliegerschule (fighter pilot school) in Werneuchen, Mayer {{was sent back to}} the Channel Front.|$|E
5|$|In the Battle of Neresheim (11 August 1796), Hotze {{commanded}} 13 battalions and 28 cavalry squadrons, a {{total of}} 13,300 men, and formed the center of Archduke Charles' line. Although Hotze's force managed to push the French out of several villages, his force was {{not strong enough to}} follow up on his advantage. Following the action at Neresheim, his force participated in the joint battles of Neumarkt and Lauf, followed by the Battle of Würzburg on 3 September 1796. During these consecutive actions, Hotze's organization and initiative led to the overwhelming of the French lines. For his actions <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>campaign,</b> he was awarded a promotion on 29 April 1797, and received the Commander's Cross of the Order of Maria Theresa.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June 1940, I. Gruppe {{was moved}} to a forward {{airfield}} at Grandvilliers in preparation for missions over the Channel Coast, but the following day, all Bf109s were sent to Wiesbaden, via Brussels, for a thorough maintenance check. The overhaul detachment arrived in Wiesbaden {{in the late afternoon}} and the pilots were sent on home leave. The cease-fire of the Armistice of 22 June 1940 went into effect on 25 June 1940, ending the Battle of France. During the French campaign, Lützow flew 64 combat missions and claimed nine victories. Under his leadership, I. Gruppe {{was one of the most}} successful units <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>campaign.</b> It was credited with 88 aerial victories for the loss of six pilots killed and ten Bf109s destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The 2001–02 {{season was}} the 104th season of {{competitive}} football played by Arsenal. Having ended the previous season as FA Cup finalists and league runners-up to Manchester United, the club went one better <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>campaign,</b> by completing the domestic double – their second {{in four years}} and third overall. Arsenal won the Premier League by a seven-point margin, were unbeaten {{away from home and}} managed the unique feat of scoring in every league game. They lost only three times in the division, all of which at home. At the Millennium Stadium, Arsenal beat Chelsea 2–0 to win the 2002 FA Cup Final. In Europe however, they fared poorly as they were eliminated in the second group stage of the UEFA Champions League.|$|E
5|$|The Orkneyinga Saga {{states that}} King William called upon the King of Mann, Ragnald Guthredsson, {{to fight against}} Harald. Rognvald had {{possibly}} spuriously claims to Harald's lands, because people remembered that Harald's mother was younger daughter of earl Haakon Paulsson, whereas the elder daughter had married the king of Isle of Man (although Ragnald's father Godfrey of Man had been that lady's stepson and not her own son). Harald, however, retook Caithness at this time. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>campaign,</b> dated to 1201, the Saga tells that Harald came to the stronghold of Bishop John of Caithness, at Scrabster. Bishop John went to meet Harald, apparently to greet him, but the Earl had him seized, tortured and mutilated. The Gesta Annalia reports that Harald tormented Bishop John in this way because he believed that John was an informant set on making trouble between Harald and King William.|$|E
5|$|These {{reinforcements}} {{came just}} in time to participate in a large German offensive against the Partisan forces in eastern Bosnia. Initially, the Regia Aeronautica also participated <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>campaign,</b> but after a tragic incident where an Italian bomber mistakenly attacked German positions near Vlasenica, the German command assigned the ZNDH the responsibility for providing the entire aerial support mission for formations on the ground. At this time there were no significant Luftwaffe forces based in Yugoslavian territory. In support of the ground forces, the ZNDH flew 121 combat missions in January, 100 missions in February and 350 in March. Although the Axis ground forces generally succeeded in their operations in January and February, in March they were forced to release the pressure as other Partisan units attacked several solitary NDH garrisons, threatening to destroy them.|$|E
