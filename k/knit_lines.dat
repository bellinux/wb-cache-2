40|$|The {{primary goal}} {{of this study is}} the {{characterization}} of high pressure die cast magnesium alloys AM 60 so that the failure model which is proposed by J. Weiler can be validated for two new castings. The input variables of failure model can be determined by characterization of different regions within the castings. Based on the location of gate system, the desired regions are identified across both castings and tensile specimens are extracted from various regions. Therefore the local mechanical properties are determined, and fracture strain of samples ranges from 1. 2 to 9. 5 %. The area fraction of porosities and skin fraction of each region are obtained from microscopic studies, and skin fraction ranges from 0. 27 to 5. 5 % for the samples which are removed from the <b>knit</b> <b>line</b> region. The area fraction of porosities ranges from 0. 4 to 2. 85 % within the <b>knit</b> <b>line</b> region, while high fraction of shrinkage porosities are observed within the fracture surface of samples removed from last-to-fill regions. By introduction of skin fraction as ligament factor of failure model, the fracture strain can be estimated with high accuracy. The deviation between predicted and experimental values was less than 90 % for most locations. The premature failure happens to the samples containing porosities within the skin region, and actual positions of pores are considered for prediction of fracture strain. The microscopic studies of sections along the flow path also indicate that the thick defect bands are formed within the flange gates, and higher fraction of the gas pores are detected within the region closer to the overflows, and average area fraction of porosities reaches 2. 8 %. To evaluate the yielding behavior of samples, the elasto-plastic transition point of the samples containing different fractions of large dendrites are determined by analysis of strain hardening rate. The fully plastic behavior begins at 107 MPa for the samples containing accumulated large dendrites within the core region, while it ranges from 121 to 132 MPa for the samples with fine microstructure...|$|R

The variations of their properties by increasing number of stretching cycles and size of deformation were examined. The cyclic stretching test was done on the tensile testing machine Z 005 (Germany).

40|$|Many large {{composite}} structures are manufactured using sandwich laminates to achieve high specific bending strength and stiffness. Examples include wind turbine blades, where self-weight becomes increasingly important as blade size increases. Resin infusion of three-dimensional sandwich laminates {{can result in}} complex resin flow paths, and subsequent defect formation, which are difficult to predict. The core material used for sandwich construction and its interaction with liquid resins may also influence the formation of defects, {{and in the case}} of balsa this effect can be used to reduce defect severity. In order to evaluate the effect of cored sandwich laminate construction on the formation of defects, this thesis concentrates on the characterisation of commonly used core materials and their interaction with liquid resin under high vacuum conditions. It also considers two numerical flow-modelling packages which are shown to be effective at the prediction of flow front convergence for monolithic laminate, but over-estimate defect severity when modelling air- permeable cored laminates. For balsa core, experiments indicate that the available pore space can act as sink for trapped air, which can aid the reduction of defects where multiple flow fronts converge due to the complexity of flow in sandwich laminates. Empirical data for air absorption and desorption rates in balsa core were obtained using a custom-designed experiment. Using these data a theoretical model was developed that can indicate available pore space, which can inform optimum processing conditions, such as time under vacuum. The diffusion coefficients obtained for air absorption and desorption in balsa are very similar, and lie in the middle of published ranges for hard woods at around 2 x 10 - 7 m 2 /s. The methodology developed for this research project represents actual behaviour of air absorption/desorption during resin infusion, whilst other techniques do not, merely measuring diffusion of air through a sample not allowing for finite pore space. In consequence, infusion strategies can be planned more precisely because core/resin interaction is better understood. <b>Knit</b> <b>line</b> defect formation could be predicted with greater accuracy with suitably modified flow-modelling programs.

5000|$|The {{death of}} the head {{designer}} left the House of Dior in chaos and general manager Jacques Rouët considered shutting down operation worldwide. This possibility was not received graciously by Dior licensees and the French fashion industry; the Maison Dior was too important to the financial stability of the industry to allow such an action. To bring the label back on its feet, Rouët promoted the 21-year-old Yves Saint-Laurent to Artistic Director the same year. Laurent had joined the House's family in 1955 after being picked out by the original designer himself for {{the position of the}} first ever and only Head Assistant. Laurent initially proved to have been the most appropriate choice after the debut of his first collection for Dior (The mention of Dior from this moment on refers to the company) in 1958. The clothes were as meticulously made and perfectly proportioned as Dior's in the same exquisite fabrics, but their young designer made them softer, lighter and easier to wear. Saint Laurent was hailed as a national hero. Emboldened by his success, his designs became more daring, culminating in the 1960 Beat Look inspired by the existentialists in the Saint-Germain des Près cafés and jazz clubs. His 1960 bohemian look was harshly criticized, and even more in Women's Wear Daily. Marcel Boussac was furious, and, in the spring, when Saint Laurent was called up to join the French army—which forced him to leave the House of Dior—the Dior management raised no objection. Saint-Laurent left after the completion of six Dior collections.Laurent was replaced at Dior by designer Marc Bohan in late 1960. Bohan instilled his conservative style on the collections. He was credited by Rebecca Arnold as the man who kept the Dior label [...] "at the forefront of fashion while still producing wearable, elegant clothes," [...] and Women's Wear Daily, not surprisingly, claimed that he [...] "rescued the firm." [...] Bohan's designs were very well esteemed by prominent social figures. Actress Elizabeth Taylor ordered twelve Dior dresses from Bohan's Spring-Summer 1961 collection featuring the [...] "Slim Look". The Dior perfume [...] "Diorling" [...] was released in 1963 and the men's fragrance [...] "Eau Sauvage" [...] was released in 1966. Bohan's assistant Philippe Guibourgé launches the first French ready-to-wear collection [...] "Miss Dior" [...] in 1967. This is {{not to be confused with}} the already existing New York Ready-to-Wear store established in 1948. Designed by Bohan, [...] "Baby Dior" [...] opens its first boutique in 1967 at 28 Avenue Montaigne. The Christian Dior Coordinated <b>Knit</b> <b>line</b> is released in 1968 and management of the Fashion Furs Department of Christian Dior is taken by Frédéric Castet. This year as well, Dior Parfums was sold to Moët-Hennessy (which would itself become LVMH) due to Boussac's ailing textile company (the still-owner of Dior). This however had no effect on the House of Dior operations, and so the Christian Dior Cosmetics business was born in 1969 with the creation of an exclusive line.|$|R

40|$|Fan-out Wafer Level Packaging (FOWLP) {{is one of}} {{the latest}} {{packaging}} trends in microelectronics. Mold embedding for this technology is currently done on wafer level up to 12 "/ 300 mm diameter. For higher productivity and therewith lower costs larger mold embedding form factors are forecasted for the near future. Following the wafer level approach then the next step will be a reconfigured wafer size of 450 mm. An alternative option would be leaving the wafer shape and moving to panel sizes leading to Fan-out Panel Level Packaging (FOPLP). Sizes for the panel could range up to 24 "× 18 " or even larger. For reconfigured mold embedding, compression mold processes are used in combination with liquid, granular or sheet compound. As a process alternative also lamination as used e. g. in PCB manufacturing can be taken into account. =Within this paper the evaluation of panel level compression molding with a target form factor of 24 ”* 18 ” / 610 × 457 mm 2 is described. The large panel size equals a typical PCB manufacturing full format and is selected to achieve process compatibility with cost efficient PCB processes. Here not only conventional compression molding is considered but also the new process compression mold lamination is introduced as a tool-less mold alternative. Panel level molding is compared to 8 ” and 12 ” wafer molding as well as to low cost PCB 24 ”× 18 ” lamination focusing on manufacturing challenges, high volume capability and estimated cost. Technological focus of this study will be the evaluation of liquid, granular and sheet molding compound. This includes thorough material analysis regarding the process relevant material properties as reactivity or viscosity. One key process step for homogeneous large area embedding is material application before compression molding. Where sheet compounds already deliver a uniform material layer the application of liquid and granular compound must - e optimized and adapted for a homogeneous distribution without flow marks, <b>knit</b> <b>lines</b> and incomplete fills. Hence, dispense patterns of liquid and granular molding compounds are studied to achieve high yield and reliable mold embedding. In addition applicable thickness ranges, total thickness variations, void risks and warpage will be investigated for the different material types.

40|$|PROBLEM - The bobbin {{friction}} stir welding (BFSW) {{process has}} potential benefits for welding thin sheet aluminium alloy. The main benefits of {{friction stir welding}} over conventional thermal welding processes are minimisation of energy usage, no need for consumables, potential for good weld quality without porosity, no fumes, minimal adverse environmental effects (green), minimal waste (lean), and reduced threats to personal health and safety. The BFSW process has further advantages over conventional friction stir welding (CFSW) in the reduction of welding forces, faster welding, and less fixturing. It is especially attractive to industries that join thin sheet material, e. g. boat-building. The industrial need for this project arose from the desire to apply the technology at a ship manufacturing company, INCAT located in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. However there are peculiar difficulties with the specific grade of material used in this industry, namely thin sheet aluminium Al 6082 -T 6. Early efforts with a portable friction stir welding machine identified the process to have low repeatability and reproducibility, i. e. process-instability. There are {{a large number of}} process variables and situational factors that affect weld quality, and many of these are covert. This is also the reason for divergent recommendations in the literature for process settings. PURPOSE - The main purpose of this research was to identify covert variables and better understand their potentially adverse effects on weld quality. Therefore, this thesis investigated the hidden variables and their interactions. Developing this knowledge is a necessity for making reliable and repeatable welds for industrial application. APPROACH - An explorative approach that focused on the functional perspective was taken. An extensive empirical testing programme was undertaken to identify the variables and their effects. In the process a force platform and BFSW tools were designed and built. A variety of machine platforms were used, namely portable friction stir welding, manual milling machine and computer numerical control (CNC) milling machine. The trials were grouped into 14 test plans. These are tool shoulder gap, spindle and travel speed, tool features, machines, tool fixation, machinery, welding direction, plate size (width and dimension), support insulation, tool materials, substrate properties and fixation. For the welded plates besides visual inspection of the weld, current, force, and temperature were measured. The Fourier transform was used to analyse the frequency response of machines. Also the welded samples were tested to the maritime standards of Det Norske Veritas (DNV). A number of relationships of causality were identified whereby certain variables affected weld quality. A model was developed to represent the proposed causality using the IDEF 0 systems engineering method. FINDINGS - From these trials six main variables have been identified. These are tool features, spindle speed, travel speed, shoulder gap compression, machine variability, tool and substrate fixation. A rigid system is required for a consistent weld results. Under this condition, full pin features (threads and flats) need to be used to balance the adverse effects of individual features. It has been shown that fabricated bobbin tools with sharp edges can cause cuts and digging thus this feature should be avoided. Additionally, the substrate should have continuous interaction with the tool so the shoulder interference needs to be fixed and well-controlled. It is found that the compression generated by the shoulder towards the substrate helps material grabbing for better tool-substrate interaction. It is also shown that tool entry causes ejection of material and hence an enduring mass deficit, which manifests as a characteristic tunnel defect. The new explanation of the formation, origin and location of this defect has been explained. Material transportation mechanisms within the weld have been elucidated. It is also found that the role of the travel speed is not only to control heat generation but also for replacing the deficit material. Additionally, heat supplied to the weld depends not only on thickness, but also the width of the plate. Different types of machine cause an interaction in the material flow through their controller strategies. Jerking motion can occur at a slow travel speed, which also alters the way material is being transported. The Fourier transform (FFT) has been used to identify the characteristics of good and bad BFSW welds. This {{has the potential to be}} expanded for real-time process control. IMPLICATIONS - Tool deflection and positioning, material flow and availability are identified as affecting weld quality through stated mechanisms. The impact is even more severe when involving thin-plate aluminium. For the industry to successfully adopt this technology the process typically needs tight control of shoulder gap, tool strength and stiffness, feature fabrication, substrate and tool fixation. Additionally spindle and travel speed need to be adjusted not only based on the type of materials and thickness, but also the width, type of machine and method of tool entry. ORIGINALITY - New data are presented, which lead to new insights into the welding mechanics, production settings, material transportation and weld defects for BFSW on thin sheet material. The conventional idea that the welding tool has a semi-steady interaction with the substrate is not supported. Instead the interaction is highly dynamic, and this materially affects the weld-quality, especially in the difficult-to-weld material under examination. Factors such as shoulder gap, tool and substrate fixation compliance and machine types emerge as variables that need to be given attention in the selection of process parameters. The causal relationships have been represented in a conceptual model using an IDEF 0 system approach. This study has made several original contributions to the body of knowledge. First is the identification of previously hidden variables that effect weld formation for the fixed gap BFSW process. The second contribution is a new way of understanding the material transportation mechanics within the weld. This includes the flow around the pin in the plane of the weld, the vertical transportation of material up the pin, the formation of turbulent-like <b>knit</b> <b>lines</b> at the advancing side, and the formation of tunnel defects. Also included here is a new understanding of how material deficit arises at tool entry and exit, and from flash/chips, and how this contributes to the tunnel weld defect. In addition, new understandings of the role of feed rate have been identified. Related to the material transportation, the work has also identified the importance of an interference fit between the substrate and tool. A third contribution is the identification of the dynamic interaction between tool and substrate. This identifies the important role rigidity plays. Associated with this is the identification of frequency characteristics of the motors under load. The fourth contribution is identification of the specific process settings for the difficult-to-weld material of AL 6082 -T 6. The fifth contribution is the development of a novel method of fabricating bobbin friction stir welding tools as embodied in a patent application...|$|E
