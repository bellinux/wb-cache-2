40|$|Knowledge of {{the natural}} {{emissions}} of mercury in the Mediterranean basin, which has large cinnabar anomalies, has particular weight as these deposits could be {{an important source of}} atmospheric mercury. Data on the <b>degassing</b> <b>rate</b> of mercury from soils sampled both in mineralized areas (Mt. Amiata, Italy and Almaden, Spain) and rural areas are reported. Measurements were carried out 'in situ' using a transparent flux chamber and collecting the gaseous mercury on gold collectors. The highest values were observed in Almaden over the roasted cinnabar banks (up to 100 mu g/m(2) h) from past and present mining activity. In Italian rural areas the values of the volatilization rate of mercury are on the order of few ng/m(2) h. The <b>degassing</b> <b>rate</b> was observed to be strongly dependent on the ambient temperature and not only seasonal but also daily variations were measured in all the studied areas...|$|E

The <b>degassing</b> <b>rate</b> of the A 1 magma (13 [*]×[*] 103  kg s− 1) {{was similar to}} that of basalt–andesite volcanoes (7 – 16 [*]×[*] 103  kg s− 1 for Etna, Izu-Oshima, Sakurajima, and Asama volcanoes; Kazahaya and Shinohara 1996; Ohwada et al. 2013). However, the degassing rates of the A 3, B 1, and B 3 magmas are higher than those of basalt–andesite volcanoes. The higher estimated degassing rates at Aso volcano could be caused by (1) underestimation of bulk sulfur content of the magma and/or overestimation of SO 2 flux or (2) more effective degassing and gas separation from magma at Nakadake volcano compared with the other volcanoes. More detailed studies on volcanic gas and melt inclusions will be required to evaluate these possibilities.|$|E
40|$|Viking {{measurements}} of the upper atmosphere of Mars have indicated thermospheric temperatures below 200 K, colder than those originally calculated by remote sensing experiments. It is suggested that dynamical coupling of {{the upper and lower}} regions of the Martian atmosphere may account for the variability in thermospheric temperature. The absorption of extreme ultraviolet solar radiation may account for observed ionospheric features, and may provide a source of fast N and O atoms escaping the planet's gravitational field. Measurements of the isotopic composition of O and N may be used to place constraints on models of the evolution of the Martian atmosphere. It is suggested that previous abundance of N 2 may have exceeded that of CO 2 in the present atmosphere, and that large sources of H 2 O may exist on the planet.

These have previously been linked to CO₂ draw-down, but the severe cold climates of the Cryogenian have never been replicated during the Phanerozoic despite similar, and sometimes more dramatic changes to carbon sinks. Here we quantify the total CO₂ input rate, both by measuring the global length of subduction zones in plate tectonic reconstructions, and by sea-level inversion. Our results indicate that <b>degassing</b> <b>rates</b> were anomalously low during the Late Neoproterozoic, roughly doubled by the Early Phanerozoic, and remained comparatively high until the Cenozoic. Our carbon cycle modelling identifies the Cryogenian as a unique period during which low surface temperature was more easily achieved, and shows that the shift towards greater CO₂ input rates after the Cryogenian helped prevent severe glaciation during the Phanerozoic.

Other factors considered are the density of packing, probe dimensions, vacuum pressure, and vacuum <b>degassing</b> <b>rates.</b> Experimental results show that the density of packing of the crushed rock particles is the dominant factor affecting the dynan 1 ic penetration. The maximum penetration occurs in air in the crushed rock with low-density packing. The 1 ninimum penetration occurs in air in densely packed material. Dynamic penetration in vacuum for the low-density and high-density packing lies between the results of penetration in air for the same packing conditions. At vacuum pressures above approximately 0. 1 mm Hg, all penetration values approach the air penetration measurements...|$|R

Results show that the rotational speed has the greatest impact on the degassing of 4004 Al alloy, followed by gas flow and refining time; stewing time has the least impact. The optimum purification parameters obtained by current orthogonal analysis were: rotor speed of 500 r·min- 1, inert gas flow of 0. 4 mL·h- 1, refining time of 15 min, and stewing time of 6 min. <b>Degassing</b> <b>rate</b> using the optimum parameters reaches 68 %. In addition, the comparison experiments among C 2 Cl 6 refining, rotary impeller degassing, and combined treatment of C 2 Cl 6 refining and rotary impeller degassing for 4004 Al alloy were performed.

40|$|Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) {{recently}} {{discovered that a}} class of inexpensive and biologically benign fluids absorb radon gas with a high efficiency at room temperature, and release radon at slightly elevated temperatures (50 - 60 OC).

40|$|Analysis of {{the thermal}} release {{patterns}} of He, Ne, and Ar from {{samples of the}} Carbo iron meteorite, showing that virtually no fractionation of He 3, He 4, Ne 21, and Ar 38 occurs. Thus conclusions about iron meteorites based on measured noble gas ratios will be unaffected by gas loss, and measurement of these ratios cannot yield information about possible loss. Further, noble gas loss cannot explain the abnormal elemental and isotopic patterns observed in some iron meteorites, notably hexahedrites. The release of He and Ne was continuously observed throughout the stepwise heating sequence, and ratios of diffusion coefficients at two consecutive temperatures have been determined from measurements of the relative <b>degassing</b> <b>rates</b> at these temperatures {{at the time of}} temperature increase. Effective activation energies of 100 plus or minus 20 kcal/mol for both He 3 and Ne 21 are calculated from the diffusion coefficient ratios at temperatures above 1050 C. A sharp maximum at 750 C in both the effective activation energy and the gas release is correlated with the alpha, gamma-phase transition...|$|R
40|$|Explosive {{volcanic}} eruptions of silcic magma often evolve towards non-explosive emissions of lava. The mechanisms underlying this transition remain unclear, however, a widely cited idea holds that shear-induced magma fragmentation plays {{a critical role}} by fostering volatile loss from fragmentary magma and through ash-filled cracks termed tuffisite. We test this hypothesis by measuring H 2 O concentrations within glassy tuffisite from the 2008 - rhyolitic eruption at volcán Chaitén, Chile. We show that while H 2 O concentrations decrease next to tuffisite veins and {{at the margins of}} obsidian fragments, the depletions cannot account for the disparity in H 2 O between explosively and effusively erupted rhyolite. Tuffisite vein lifetimes derived from diffusion modeling (min to hrs) imply <b>degassing</b> <b>rates</b> that are too slow to effectively degas magma, unless the magma was entirely fragmented to mm or smaller particles. This level of brecciation may locally develop near conduit margins, but is unrealistic for entire conduits. The primary role of melt fracturing may therefore be to provide gas-escape pathways for more efficient degassing of permeable vesicular magma in the conduit interior...|$|R

40|$|Syn-eruptive {{crystallisation}} can drastically increase magma viscosity, {{with profound}} implications for conduit dynamics, lava emplacement and volcanic hazards. There is growing evidence that crystallisation {{is not only}} cooling-driven, but can also occur almost isothermally during decompression-induced degassing on ascent from depth. Here we review field and experimental evidence for degassing-driven crystallisation {{in a range of}} magma compositions. We then present new results showing, for the first time, experimental evidence for this process in basaltic magma. Our experiments use simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry coupled with mass spectrometry (TGA-DSC-MS) to monitor degassing patterns and thermal events during heating and cooling of porphyritic basaltic samples from Mt. Etna, Italy. The partly degassed samples, which contained 0. 39 – 0. 81 wt. % total volatiles in the glass fraction, were subjected to two cycles of heating from ambient to 1250 °C. On the first heating, TGA data show that 30 – 60 % of the total volatiles degassed slowly at < 1050 °C, and that the <b>degassing</b> <b>rate</b> increased rapidly above this temperature. DSC data indicate that this rapid increase in the <b>degassing</b> <b>rate</b> was closely followed (≤ 3. 4 min) by a strongly exothermic event, which is interpreted as crystallisation. Enthalpies measured for this event suggest that up to 35 % of the sample crystallises, a value supported by petrographic observations of samples quenched after the event. As neither degassing nor crystallisation was observed at high temperature during the second heating cycle we infer that the events on first heating constitute degassing-driven crystallisation. The rapidity and magnitude of the crystallisation response to degassing indicates that this process may strongly affect the rheology of basaltic magma in shallow conduits and lava flows, and thus influence the hazards posed by basaltic volcanism...|$|E
40|$|Solfatara crater, {{located in}} the Campi Flegrei caldera, is a volcano {{with one of the}} highest <b>degassing</b> <b>rates</b> on Earth, more than 1500 t of CO 2 {{released}} by diffusion or through vents. Here, we investigated how this gas release can be disrupted by the passage of seismic waves. We performed continuous soil CO 2 flux measurements during the propagation of seismic vibrations in the range of 5 Hz to 200 Hz induced by a vibroseis truck. The CO 2 flux was continuously recorded using the accumulation chamber method. The data show a temporary and drastic (up to two-fold) increase in CO 2 flux exclusively during the vibrations, before returning to the initial flux values. These transient variations are interpreted as fluidization of the surficial granular layer that releases the stored gas. Similar degassing processes might occur at a larger scale during earthquakes, to cause temporary increases in the total gas outflow in volcanic or tectonic areas. Our findings are useful to better assess and monitor the potential hazard from sudden CO 2 flux release during earthquakes as several cases of intoxication or death have already been related to volcanic degassing...|$|R

Each instrument allows one SO 2 scan to be recorded every ~ 6 min. Here we report the methods that we developed to automatically and robustly transform SO 2 profiles into SO 2 flux data. Radian geometry and Fast Fourier Transform algorithm were used for reducing plume cross sections and for discriminating between volcanic plumes from those produced by water vapour clouds. Uncertainty in flux measurements depends on the accuracy of plume-height estimation, on assumptions concerning plume-geometry, and {{on the quality of}} the retrieved SO 2 amounts. We compare 3 years of flux measurements made using both the automated network and “conventional” traverse methods beneath the plume. We found a good agreement between the datasets, both in terms of magnitude and in temporal variations. These results validate the Etna SO 2 flux monitoring system.

In this study we present measurements made in July and halogens (HF, HCl, HBr and HI) in the new 2008. We characterize the gas chemistry in terms of SO 2 plume from Halema’uma’u in order to compare them with other plumes worldwide, including those from subduction zone settings and other emissions from Kilauea itself. Further to this we characterize the plume’s chemistry in terms of emissions of environmentally important metallic species both in the size- segregated aerosol (important for determining atmospheric lifetime and potential speciation) {{and in the case of}} Hg in the gas phase (both in the elemental form and reactive forms). To complement this plume characterization we also looked at preliminary environmental samples of grasses, rainwater and fog in order to investigate potential future avenues for research into the environmental consequences of Kilauea’s volcanic emissions...|$|R

It is shown that the dependence of the mantle viscosity on the volatile content has important effects on the thermal evolution of planetary interiors {{and the evolution of}} planetary atmospheres.

The model yields four distinct classes of impact-generated atmospheres: the first, on which emphasis is placed, has as its salient feature a molten surface that is maintained by the opacity of a massive water vapor atmosphere; the second occurs when the EUV-limited escape exceeds the impact <b>degassing</b> <b>rate,</b> while the third is dominated by impact erosion and the fourth is characterized by an atmosphere more massive than any thus far encountered...|$|E

The theory for the prediction of the thickness, velocity and the particle concentration of each layer is presented.

40|$|Villarrica {{is one of}} {{the most}} active volcanoes in Chile and one of the few in the world with an active lava lake within its crater. This snow-covered volcano generates {{frequent}} strombolian eruptions and lava flows and, at times, the melting of snow can cause massive lahars. The most common types of activity at Villarrica are, however, continuous degassing and high-level seismicity. In order to investigate the mechanisms driving the persistent degassing and seismic activity at the volcano, we use a multiparameter approach based on high time-resolution gas flux measurements and seismic data. The instrumentation includes 3 stationary NOVAC-type scanning Mini-DOAS spectrometers for the quantification of SO 2 fluxes, installed at the volcano in March 2009, and 7 short period and broadband seismometers. This equipment complements the existing OVDAS (Observatorio Volcanológico de los Andes del Sur) volcano monitoring network. Based of the combination of gas and seismological measurements we aim at gaining insight into magmatic and volcano- tectonic processes, especially factors playing a role for the onset of volcanic unrest. Since the gas monitoring network has been installed at the volcano a correlation between SO 2 emissions and seismic activity (LP events) has been recognized.

40|$|Investigating Etna’s {{long-term}} SO 2 ﬂux behaviour has led {{to important}} conclusions {{on the structure of}} the volcano’s magma feeding system, magma production (and <b>degassing)</b> <b>rates,</b> and causes for the excess degassing behaviour. Nonetheless, our knowledge of the short-term (timescales of seconds to a few hours) behaviour of magmatic volatiles (e. g., bubble coalescence, separate ascent and surface bursting of gas-rich bubbles) in the volcano’s upper feeding conduit system is still fragmentary, and based on indirect evidences (petrologic-textural data, observation of geophysical signals, physical modelling and laboratory experiments). In the past, direct gas ﬂux measurements at Etna have been taken with insufﬁcient temporal resolution for fast conduit processes to be investigated. UV cameras now allow imaging of gas ﬂux emissions, and exploration of underlying volcanic degassing processes, with an improved temporal resolution. In this work we show that UV cameras can valuably assist in capturing the rapid (timescale of seconds) SO 2 ﬂux variations occurring during the quiescent activity of a basaltic volcano. We have, in particular, investigated the non-stationary nature of degassing activity at Etna’s North-east crater, which is shown here to exhibit a somewhat periodic degassing behaviour (characteristic periods ranging 40 - 250 s). A similar degassing behaviour has recently been observed at other volcanoes (Stromboli, Erebus, San Cristobal, Gorely), and probably represents a common feature of all basaltic volcanoes. We ﬁnally present a preliminary model, which results suggest that the periodic degassing pattern may reﬂect inhomogeneous distribution of gas bubbles in a magmatic conduit, and their clustering to form trains of variably spaced gas bubble layers...|$|R
40|$|K-feldspar (Kfs) {{from the}} Chain of Ponds Pluton (CPP) is the archetypal {{reference}} material, on which thermochronological modeling of Ar diffusion in discrete “domains” was founded. We re-examine the CPP Kfs using cathodoluminescence and back-scattered electron imaging, transmission electron microscopy, and electron probe microanalysis. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar stepwise heating experiments on different sieve fractions, and on handpicked and unpicked aliquots, are compared. Our results reproduce the staircase-shaped age spectrum and the Arrhenius {{trajectory of the}} literature sample, confirming that samples collected from the same locality have an identical Ar isotope record. Even the most pristine-looking Kfs from the CPP contains successive generations of secondary, metasomatic/retrograde mineral replacements that post-date magmatic crystallization. These chemically and chronologically distinct phases are responsible for its staircase-shaped age spectra, which are modified by handpicking. While genuine within-grain diffusion gradients are not ruled out by these data, this study demonstrates {{that the most important}} control on staircase-shaped age spectra is the simultaneous presence of heterochemical, diachronous post-magmatic mineral growth. At least five distinct mineral species were identified in the Kfs separate, three of which can be traced to external fluids interacting with the CPP in a chemically open system. Sieve fractions have size-shifted Arrhenius trajectories, negating the existence of the smallest “diffusion domains”. Heterochemical phases also {{play an important role in}} producing non-linear trajectories. In vacuo <b>degassing</b> <b>rates</b> recovered from Arrhenius plots are neither related to true Fick’s Law diffusion nor to the staircase shape of the age spectra. The CPP Kfs used to define the "diffusion domain" model demonstrates the predominance of metasomatic alteration by hydrothermal fluids and recrystallization in establishing the natural Ar distribution amongst different coexisting phases that gives rise to the staircase-shaped age spectrum.

40|$|Short period seismic {{data have}} {{represented}} {{for a long}} time the major geophysical dataset available for the investigation of the processes going on inside a volcano with moderate permanent explosive activity such as Stromboli (Aeolian Islands, Italy). The installation of (arrays of) broadband seismic instruments has considerably widened our views but in order to go further with the understanding and with the modelling, the integration of seismic data with other signals is a strong necessity. A path-finder experiment was conducted in June 1999 recording simultaneous thermal, seismic and infrasonic measurements, and a more extensive field campaign was carried out in May 2000. The role of the gas has always been recognized as a major one in the dynamics of the conduit. Analyses of data recorded in 1999 campaign indicate that periods of high and low rates of explosive activity can be related to the magnitude and frequency at which small gas bursts occur. These in turn can reflect the dynamics of the build-up and decay of foam layers and, possibly, offer an insight into the rate at which fresh, gas-rich magma supplies the shallow vents system. Variations in gas temperature, recurrence of gas bursts, and frequency of strombolian explosions indicate that magma-foam levels, or magma-gas supply, could change over minute-long periods as the system cycles between 5 - to 40 -minutes long periods characterized by different <b>degassing</b> <b>rates.</b> These first results are being verified and extended by analyzing the longer datasets recorded in May 2000 campaign. In our model, foam layer generation and collapse at Stromboli's shallow system alternates between periods of low and high activity, which may be linked to the rise, and subsequent degassing and sinking, of discrete fresh magma/gas batches. This model seems to be confirmed by the good correlation between time delays between infrasonic and infrared onsets and temperature fluctuations at the vent...|$|R

Since 2009, seismic networks have been deployed at Llaima and Villarrica, and mini-DOAS stations continuously recording SO 2 degassing were installed in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The response of Llaima and Villarrica volcanoes to local volcano-seismic activity, to regional events, and also to the tectonic activity related to the great Maule earthquake (M 8. 8) in February 2010 are investigated. Time series for tremors, long period and volcano tectonic events were obtained from the catalogue of the Volcanic Observatory of the Southern Andes (OVDAS in Spanish) and from the continuous record of the SFB 574 temporary volcanic network. At Villarrica volcano, peaks of activity of tremor and long period events were observed months prior to and after the earthquake, which is consistent with an increase in the activity related to fluids (gas and magma). Degassing at Villarrica followed a complex pattern, where increased <b>degassing</b> <b>rates</b> preceded the M 8. 8 Maule earthquake by three months. Days before the earthquake, there was a strong decrease in degassing, and finally by a persistent degassing maximum about one month after the earthquake. At Llaima, a high increase in the volcano tectonic activity was observed directly after the earthquake, consistent with a possible structural adjustment response. Also, continuous low fumarolic degassing was observed during and after the earthquake at Llaima, but this activity could be related to the closing of the eruption cycle started in January 2008.

40|$|EcoGrout is a {{new method}} to {{strengthen}} and stabilize unconsolidated sediments in the subsurface. This method is based solely on chemically induced calcite precipitation. In situ precipitation of calcite will result in cementation of the grain particles during the EcoGrout process. Consequently, it will also decrease the porosity and thereby the permeability of the soil. The basic application of Ecogrout involves use of a solution with a designated degree of calcite saturation and CO 2 pressure {{by the use of}} calcium chloride (CaCl 2), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) and pH adjustments to control both the amount and rate of calcite precipitation. This modelling study explores the conditions under which precipitation amounts and rates can be controlled and prevent clogging {{in the vicinity of the}} injection point, whilst ensuring sufficient radii of influence for the Ecogrout treatment. To analyze this EcoGrout process, a model for multiphase flow of multiple gas-components and water (STOMP-WNE) with a reactive batch chemistry module (ECKEchem) is used. This model is extended to account for porosity and permeability alteration over time during calcite precipitation. Also a kinetic equation for degassing of CO 2 proposed by Zhao et al. (2011) is implemented. Simulation of an injection pulse with an EcoGrout solution at calcite equilibrium at a pCO 2 of 5. 1 atm was done to investigate the behavior of CO 2 degassing in the porous medium and its effect on calcite precipitation. Several cases with different mechanical properties, kinetic properties or EcoGrout solution configurations are presented to investigate its sensitivity on CO 2 degassing and calcite precipitation. Precipitation of calcite is controlled by the degassing of CO 2. Due to degassing of CO 2 the alkalinity and pH increase. Consequently, the injected EcoGrout solution becomes supersaturated with respect to calcite and calcite precipitation starts. Since the pore volume reduction obtained from one injection pulse is low, many injections are required to obtain the required cementation within the soil. Large injection radii can be achieved when the injection pressure is higher than the pCO 2 of the solutions and no degassing occurs during the injection. In addition, the <b>degassing</b> <b>rates</b> of CO 2 are sufficiently low that injection at CO 2 supersaturation is also feasible...|$|R
40|$|On 2 nd/ 3 rd November 2002, a {{huge amount}} of gas, mainly {{composed}} of CO 2, was suddenly released from the sea bottom off the coast of Panarea, producing a ‘‘crater’’ 20 by 10 meters wide and 7 meters deep. The gas output was estimated to be 109 l/d, two orders of magnitude higher than that measured in the 1980 s. The anomalous <b>degassing</b> <b>rate</b> lasted for some weeks, slowly decreasing to an almost constant rate of about 4 x 107 l/d after two months. The geothermo- barometric estimations revealed an increase of both the temperature and pressure in the geothermal system feeding the sampled vents. The 3 He/ 4 He ratios were similar to those measured in nearby Stromboli. We have monitored the area for the last two decades, and based on our intensive and extensive geochemical measurements, have ascertained that the geothermal reservoir has lost its steady state. We maintain that a new magmatic input caused these phenomena...|$|E
40|$|On {{behalf of}} the TS-MME-CCS section Since 1997, Ti-Zr-V thin films have been studied to provide a {{solution}} to the problems of both pressure distribution and electron cloud build-up in beam pipes. Nowadays, this material is coated on the whole inner surface of vacuum chambers providing large pumping speed, low <b>degassing</b> <b>rate</b> and secondary electron yield. These favourable characteristics are obtained after heating in vacuum at temperatures higher than 180 °C. Unfortunately, heating at such temperatures is not always possible for the future CERN projects: in some cases, magnet designs impose lower heating temperatures; in other cases, heating is not allowed at all, as for most of the existing SPS vacuum chambers. To overcome these limitations, two lines of development have been drawn; if pursed successfully, they will allow the production of both NEG films with lower activation temperature (150 °C being our target) and films or surface treatments providing low secondary electron yield without any heating...|$|E
30|$|The pCO 2 in {{the global}} {{terrestrial}} waters of lower alluvial basins with well-developed soils and active agriculture is often over several thousand μatm, {{much higher than the}} atmospheric level (400  μatm) (Cole et al. 2007; Raymond et al. 2013; Manaka et al. 2015 b). Terrestrial waters can receive 1.9 PgC year− 1 of soil carbon, which was originally fixed by the photosynthesis process (Regnier et al. 2013). The global riverine flux of carbon to the ocean is 1.06 PgC year− 1 (Li et al. 2017), which could enhance pCO 2 in coastal regions. Soil-derived carbon, mainly dissolved organic carbon, is decomposed in the water and released directly to the atmosphere in the form of CO 2 (Rasilo et al. 2017). The global CO 2 <b>degassing</b> <b>rate</b> from water is 1.1 PgC year− 1, which is comparable in magnitude to that from fossil fuel and cement. One of the largest CO 2 evasions is reported for the Amazon River; the estimated flux is as high as 0.47 PgC year− 1 from the entire basin (Richey et al. 2002).|$|E
40|$|Dome {{growth at}} the Soufriere Hills volcano (1996 to 1998) was {{frequently}} accompanied by repetitive cycles of earthquakes, ground deformation, degassing, and explosive eruptions. The cycles reflected unsteady conduit flow of volatile-charged magma resulting from gas exsolution, rheological stiffening, and pressurization. The cycles, over hours to days, initiated when degassed stiff magma retarded {{flow in the}} upper conduit. Conduit pressure built with gas exsolution, causing shallow seismicity and edifice inflation. Magma and gas were then expelled and the edifice deflated. The repeat time-scale is controlled by magma ascent <b>rates,</b> <b>degassing,</b> and microlite crystallization kinetics. Cyclic behavior allows short-term forecasting of timing, and of eruption style related to explosivity potential...|$|R
40|$|An {{internally}} heated {{model of}} parameterized whole mantle convection with viscosity dependent on temperature and volatile content is examined. The model is run for 4 l 6 Gyr, and temperature, heat flow, <b>degassing</b> and regassing <b>rates,</b> stress, and viscosity are calculated. A nominal case is established which shows good agreement with accepted mantle values. The effects of changing various parameters are also tested. All cases show rapid cooling {{early in the}} planet's history and strong self-regulation of viscosity due to the temperature and volatile-content dependence. The effects of weakly stress-dependent viscosity are examined {{within the bounds of}} this model and are found to be small. Mantle water is typically outgassed rapidly to reach an equilibrium concentration on a time scale of less than 200 Myr for almost all models, the main exception being for models which start out with temperatures well below the melting temperature...|$|R
40|$|We {{present results}} of the technology, {{manufacturing}} andfirst tests of a novel MCP-based sector prototypefor the Forward Multiplicity Detector for the ALICE experiment at the LHC. The detector is to provide better than sqrt (M) /M resolution for high multiplicity events, and about 50 pstiming resolution. Two Sector MCPs are mounted on a 200 ceramics board with the multipad readout integrated with a passive summator. This microelectronics UHF device provides isochronous analogue summation of the fast 1 ns signal components from 8 pads, along with the individual readout of charges. The setup is baked under 300 C and then sealedinto a singular thin wall (200) stainlesssteel vacuum sector chamber with Ti getter keeping a vacuum of 10 - 5 Torr. The separation of the fast and slow componentsallows us to use this detector as the zero level trigger,in pile up and beam-gas interaction diagnostics and for thedetermination of the collision vertex along the beam axis. The {{results of the}} first and future lab and in-beam tests are discussed and presented. SUMMARYThis job is a continuation of our studiesof the fast applications [1] for the Forward Multiplicity Detector in the ALICE experimentat the LHC [2] Two Sector MCPs (about 18 cm 2 area) are mountedon a thin (200) single ceramics boardwith the microelectronics design for multipad readout integrated with a passivesummator [3]. This UHF device provides isochronous analogue summation of thefast components of 1 ns signals from 8 pads along with the individual readout of charges [4]. The setup is assembled together with theceramic plate which integrates multichannel feedthroughsand one cylinder Ti-getter pump specially developed forthis detector. This ceramic plate is welded to the stainless steel vacuum sector chamber. Special Al coating is applied on the inner side of the 200 micronthick chamber walls in order to prevent hydrogen diffusion. The whole setup is baked under 300 C,a getter Ti pump is activated, and then the chamber is hermetically sealed, providing the working vacuum of 10 (- 5) Torr. The separation of the fast and slow signal components which is done by passive summatorallows us to use this detector as the zero level trigger, in pile-up and beam-gas interaction diagnostics and for thedetermination of the collision vertex position along the beam axis [2], [4]. Small area (1 cm 2) prototype detectors were widely used during the initial stages of the technological developments. Vacuum tests were performed: <b>degassing</b> <b>rates</b> were studied for the stainless steel thin wall chamber, Ti getter, MCPs and ceramics board and feedthroughs. UHFstudies confirmed the technological feasibilities of the passive summator and feedtroughs design with the useful frequency range up to 1. 1 GHz. First in-beam studies were done at the low energy university cyclotron. Future in-beam tests are also planned.
