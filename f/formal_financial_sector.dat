50|$|Women's lack {{of access}} to finance, due to a variety of factors such as absence of {{collateral}} and negotiating power, {{is one of the main}} barriers to improving the productive capacity of women workers. The large majority of microfinance institutes view rural women as “ostensibly a credit risk.” When women are approved for loans, they are often faced with unmanageably high interest rates, averaging 10% per month, which can deplete savings quickly. Although savings and credit cooperatives exist in developing countries to avoid dealing with microfinance institutions and are often the recipients of support services from the government, many are still male-dominated and discourage women from joining. For example, in Kenya, only 3% of women have access to the <b>formal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector,</b> as opposed to 44% of men.|$|E
50|$|Financial {{inclusion}} or inclusive financing is {{the delivery}} of financial services at affordable costs to sections of disadvantaged and low-income segments of society, in contrast to financial exclusion where those services are not available or affordable. Financial refers to all types of financial services, including savings, payments and credit from all types of formal financial institutions. An estimated 2 billion working-age adults globally {{have no access to}} the types of formal financial services delivered by regulated financial institutions. For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa, only 24% of adults have a bank account even though Africa's <b>formal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> has grown in recent years. It is argued that as financial services can be viewed in that are significant positive externalities when more people and firms participate. The availability of financial services that meet the specific needs of users without discrimination is a key objective of financial inclusion.|$|E

Rather than having direction imposed upon them by international organizations or developed countries, the members of AFI determine their priorities and direction through consultation with other members (using forums, working groups and one to one meetings), and then develop policy based on the specific needs of their populations and the capacity of their countries.|$|E

The second objective {{is to determine the}} strength and significance of such links between informal and <b>formal</b> <b>financial</b> institutions with respect to saving mobilization and the process of credit dispersion in the informal sector. To realize these twin objectives, the study focused on moneylenders and savings & credit associations in the informal and semi-form al <b>financial</b> <b>sectors</b> in Nigeria.

Contemporaneous micro-level studies, using more qualitative research methodologies, provide evidence that questions {{the strength of this}} trend, and more recent All-India credit surveys show, first, a levelling, and then a rise, in the share of rural informal credit in 1990 / 91 and 2000 / 01, respectively.

40|$|To {{the best}} our knowledge, {{in the first}} {{empirical}} macroeconomic examination of the nexus between financial intermediation and mobile phones, Asongu employs two conflicting financial system definitions {{in the assessment of}} how mobile phones have stimulated financial development in Africa. Within the framework of the dominant International Monetary Fund's International Financial Statistics (2008) definition, mobile phones are established to be negatively associated with financial intermediary dynamics of depth, activity and size. Conversely, when the previously neglected informal <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> is integrated into the conception, definition and measurement of the financial system, mobile phones are positively (negatively) correlated with the informal (<b>formal)</b> <b>financial</b> intermediation <b>sector.</b> The empirical evidence is based on 52 African countries. Causality in the established linkages has been confirmed in subsequent studies by the same author. At least three policy implications derive from the findings. First, the role of informal financial intermediation is increasing to the detriment of <b>formal</b> <b>financial</b> mechanisms. Second, in order to capture the positive effect of mobile phones on finance, it is imperative to integrate the missing informal <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> component into the IMF definition of the financial system.

CRBs have gained an increasing share of financial assets, which has been particularly helpful for satisfying the growing demand for loans and advances in poor people in the country. However, performance of SFIs in Sri Lanka is less than satisfactory and highly criticised today. Poor performance has been attributed to poor management of assets and consequently, the sustainability of these institutions is uncertain. Moreover, an attention to the efficiency of SFIs in Sri Lanka is more concern to the general public given collapses of several formal and informal SFIs. Hence, aim of this study is to evaluate the overall efficiency of SFIs in Sri Lanka by taking all CRBs operate in Sri Lanka.

We find that MFIs reach more clients and are more profitable where access to the formal financial system is low. This finding is in line with the market-failure hypothesis: MFIs respond to a need that banks do not fulfill and flourish where the formal banking sector fails. However, we also find indications of interdependencies between MFI-performance and <b>formal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> development. First, MFIs are less profitable where interest rates are higher reflecting the fact that MFIs depend upon the domestic banking system for additional funding. Secondly, MFIs are less profitable where inflation is high, suggesting that MFIs benefit from stability of the formal financial system. Overall, the results show that the macro-economic environment is crucial to fully understand MFI-performance and that outreach and accordingly impact of MFIs are contingent on financial sector development. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

These effects generate greater opportunities that help immigrants perform better economically through broader economic mechanisms. As a result, it is expected that ethnic networks increase the propensity of immigrant entrepreneurship in the host country (e.g. Borjas [1995]; Toussaint-Comeau [2008]).|$|E

Take, for instance, policies regarding remittances from the United States to poor countries. Thus far, these policies have been primarily focused on: i) lowering transactions fees, and ii) integrating immigrant populations into the <b>formal</b> <b>financial</b> (banking) <b>sector</b> with the expectation that cheaper and more secure money transfer mechanisms will increase remittance flows. Yet, to date, we know little about the optimal design of these policies. Would we do best encouraging and facilitating large lump-sum transfers?

Will remittance-receiving households respond in one way to transfers that are predictable and in another way to transfers that are less predictable? And, if so, does this help us understand the expenditure patterns of remittance inflows in various emigrant-sending economies? Our intent has been to learn about the conditions under which remittances are more likely to promote asset accumulation. We {{believe that our}} findings suggest that the predictability of remittance income should be given full consideration in order to better comprehend how households spend remittances and, accordingly, in the design of policies that leverage the most out of remittance inflows into developing economies.|$|R
