The behavior of major plate boundary fault zones in the brittle-ductile transition remains poorly understood despite the significant role {{the behavior of}} this zone has in the formation ofhydrothermal ores and nucleation of earthquakes. Recent geophysical evidence of continental faults and subduction zones suggests that aseismic slip occurs on deep extensions of fault zones. These episodic, low frequency events of slow slip are widely linked {{to the presence of}} overpressured metamorphic fluids, such as is interpreted from the geophysical signal of the Alpine Fault, New Zealand. A combination of detailed petrographic and mineral chemistry analysis with quantitative microstructural analysis using Electron Backscatter Diffraction is used to investigate <b>indicators</b> of slow <b>slip</b> shear failure.

We performed low- to high-velocity rock friction experiments designed to impose realistic coseismic slip pulses on calcite fault gouges, and report that localized dynamic recrystallization may be an easy-to-recognize microstructural <b>indicator</b> of seismic <b>slip</b> in shallow, otherwise brittle fault zones. Calcite gouges with starting grain size < 250 μm were confined up to 26 MPa normal stress using a purpose-built sample holder. Slip velocities were between 0. 01 and 3. 4 m s− 1, and total displacements between 1 and 4 m. At coseismic slip velocities ≥ 0. 1 m s− 1, the gouges were cut by reflective principal slip surfaces lined by polygonal grains < 1 μm in size. The principal slip surfaces were flanked by < 300 μm thick layers of dynamically recrystallized calcite (grain size 1 – 10 μm) containing well-defined shape- and crystallographic-preferred orientations. Dynamic recrystallization was accompanied by fault weakening and thermal decomposition of calcite to CO 2 + CaO. The recrystallized calcite aggregates resemble those found along the principal slip surface of the Garam thrust, South Korea, exhumed from < 5 km depth. We suggest that intense frictional heating along the experimental and natural principal slip surfaces resulted in localized dynamic recrystallization, a microstructure that may be diagnostic of seismic slip in the shallow crust...|$|R

40|$|Base {{roughness}} {{plays an}} important role to the dynamics of granular flows but is yet poorly understood due to the difficulty of its quantification. For a bumpy base made by spheres, at least two factors should be considered to characterize its geometric roughness, namely the size ratio of base- to flow-particles and the packing of base particles. In this paper, we propose a definition of base roughness, Ra, which is a function of both the size ratio and the packing arrangement of base particles. The function is generalized for random and regular packing of multi-layered spheres, where the range of possible values of Ra is studied, along with the optimal values to create maximum base roughness. The new definition is applied to granular flows down chute in both two- and three-dimensional configurations. It is proven to be a good <b>indicator</b> of <b>slip</b> condi- tion, and a transition occurs from slip to non-slip condition as Ra increases. Critical values of Ra are identified {{for the construction of a}} non-slip base. The effects of contact parameters on base velocity are studied, and it is shown that while the coefficient of friction is less influential, normal damping has more profound effect on base velocity at lower values of Ra.

40|$|A {{major problem}} in {{seismology}} and structural geology is the lack, at least apparently, of clear records of seismic fault slip. Some geologists even suggested that, except for pseudotachylytes, earthquakes do not leave detectable geological indicators along faults. Discovering new geological indicators of seismic fault slip is therefore a challenging but also a very important target to advance the knowledge of how, where, when, and why earthquakes occur along faults. High-velocity weakening of faults may drive fault motion during large earthquakes. Laboratory experiments on simulated faults in Carrara marble performed at seismic slip rates (about 1 m/s) showed that thermal decomposition of calcite due to frictional heating induces pronounced fault weakening with very low friction coefficients (about 0. 1 instead of a typical rock friction coefficient of 0. 7). The ultra-low friction appears {{to be associated with}} the flash heating on the ultrafine products of calcite decomposition. It follows that thermal decomposition may be an important process for the dynamic weakening of carbonate-bearing faults and the products of calcite thermal decomposition (i. e. ultrafine particles and decomposition-related minerals) may be clear <b>indicators</b> of seismic <b>slip</b> in exhumed faults. Energy budget calculations predict seismic slip to be localized in ultra-thin slipping zones, compared to crystalline rocks. This research field is among the most promising ones in seismology and structural geology and recent results from laboratory simulations require proper validation in natural examples. Other likely seismic <b>slip</b> <b>indicators</b> are fault zone-related pulverized rocks, consisting of mechanically-pulverized rocks lacking in significant shear and preserving most of their original fabric. Pulverized rocks such as those recently found in the damage zone of active faults (i. e., the Hartebeestfontein mine in South Africa and the San Andreas Fault in California) are still poorly documented and studied. Further field and experimental studies are therefore required to establish the diffusion of these fault zone rocks, the mechanism of production, and whether they can be commonly considered as indicators of ancient earthquakes. Carbonate rocks usually occur in the upper portion of the crust and are often known as hypocenters of shallow earthquakes. For this reason, exposures of exhumed faults in carbonate rocks are a promising target to study earthquake rupture dynamics in the shallow crust. Faults exposed in carbonate rocks from three sites of central Italy (i. e. Mattinata, Sperlonga, and Venere sites) and one site in northwestern England (i. e. the Dent Fault) are here indicated as potentially suitable to research earthquake indicators similar to those mentioned above (i. e. mineralogical thermal decomposition and pulverized rocks) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the formation mechanisms of rounded clast-cortex aggregates, a composite grain {{found in the}} slipping zones of faults hosted in calcite- and clay-rich rocks. The natural aggregates contain a central clast commonly made of host-rock fragments or reworked cataclasite from the slipping zone. The central clasts are surrounded by an outer cortex of calcite or clay grains a few mu m or less in size. In laboratory experiments on calcite gouges using two rotary-shear apparatus we {{investigated the}} dependence of clast-cortex aggregate formation on the applied slip rate, normal stress, total displacement and ambient humidity. Clast-cortex aggregates formed at all investigated slip rates (100 mu m/s to 1 m/s) but only at relatively low normal stresses (<= 5 MPa). The aggregates were better developed with increasing displacement (up to 5 m) and did not form in experiments with water-dampened gouges. In the experiments, aggregates formed in low-strain regions within the gouge layers, adjacent to the highest-strain slip zones. We propose that clast-cortex aggregates in calcite-bearing slip zones form in the shallow portions of faults during shearing in relatively dry conditions, but our experiments suggest that they cannot be used as <b>indicators</b> of seismic <b>slip.</b> Formation involves clast rotation due to granular flow accompanied by accretion of fine matrix material possibly facilitated by electrostatic forces...|$|R

40|$|At {{the field}} scale, nearly all fault {{surfaces}} contain grooves generated as {{one side of}} the fault slips past the other. Grooves are so common that they are one of the key <b>indicators</b> of principal <b>slip</b> surfaces. Here, we show that at sufficiently small scales, grooves do not exist on fault surfaces. A transition to isotropic roughness occurs at 4 - 500 mm. Although the scale of the transition can vary even between locales on a single fault, the aspect ratio of the roughness at the transition is well defined for a given fault. We interpret the transition between grooved and ungrooved scales as a transition in deformation mode of asperities on the slip surface. Grooves can form when a hard indenter slides past a softer surface. At small scales, the asperities appear to yield plastically and therefore do not generate grooves as hard indenters. The plastic yielding can be a consequence of the high shear strains required to deform the surfaces at small scales where the aspect ratio (roughness) is high. The transition to plastic yielding is predicted to occur at a specific aspect ratio for each fault, as observed. The new observation both shows a limit {{to one of the most}} commonly observed features of faults and suggests a change in the mode of failure of faults as a function of scale. © 2016 The Authors...|$|R
40|$|Exhumed fault zones offer {{insights}} into deformation processes associated with earthquakes in unparalleled spatial resolution; however {{it can be}} diffi-cult to differentiate seismic slip from slow or aseismic slip based on evidence in the rock record. Fifteen years ago, Cowan (1999) defined the attributes of earthquake slip that might be preserved in the rock record, and he identi-fied pseudotachylyte as the only reliable indicator of past earthquakes found in ancient faults. This assertion was based on models of frictional heat production (Sibson, 1975, 1986) providing evidence for fast slip. Signifi-cant progress in fault rock studies has revealed a range of reaction products {{which can be used}} to detect frictional heating at peak temperatures less than the melt temperature of the rock. In addition, features formed under extreme transient stress conditions associated with the propagating tip of an earthquake rupture can now be recognized in the rock record, and are also uniquely seismic. Thus, pseudotachylyte is no longer the only indicator of fossilized earthquake ruptures. We review the criteria for seismic slip defined by Cowan (1999), and we determine that they are too narrow. Fault slip at rates in the range 10 − 4 − 101 m/s is almost certainly dynamic. This implies that features reproduced in experiments at rates as low as 10 − 4 m/s may be <b>indicators</b> of seismic <b>slip.</b> We conclude with a summary of the rock record of seismic slip, and lay out the current challenges in the field of earthquake geology...|$|R
40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: Aviemore Dam was {{constructed}} across the Waitaki River valley in the mid- 1960 s. The dam straddles the steeply WSW-dipping Waitangi Fault.

The investigations documented two, and possibly three, surface rupture fault movements on the Waitangi Fault in the last c. 23, 000 years, with the most recent movement between 13, 100 and 14, 100 years ago. These ruptures were located up to 10 m west of the bedrock fault that juxtaposes Mesozoic- and Tertiary-age rocks (respectively east and west of the fault), and had single-event vertical separations in the range of 0. 5 m to 2. 0 m. Slickenside-lineations, and other <b>slip</b> <b>indicators,</b> show oblique right-lateral – reverse movement along the fault in the late Quaternary with horizontal (H) to vertical (V) ratios of displacement in the range of 1 H: 3 V to 1 H: 1 V, suggesting net single-event surface-rupture displacements in the range of 0. 53 m to 2. 9 m. In addition, a zone of “small-scale ” late Quaternary faults and folds extends up to at least 150 m west of the Waitangi Fault. The fault displacement characterisations documented here were subsequently used to derive earthquake performance assessments for the dam, and to evaluate dam safety under direct fault rupture loadings. ...|$|R

The 84 m of core comprises Miocene-age well-bedded muds, silts, and volcaniclastic sediments. Beds increase in dip with depth, and are cut by (i) soft-sediment deformation bands (“vein structures”), (ii) ? 1 -cm thick shear zones within ? 10 -cm thick regions of high shear strain, and (iii) < 1 -mm thick slickensided faults which are the youngest structures in the core and highly localized. Microstructural analyses of the shear zones suggest that they formed via multiple increments of shear localization and a mixed granular and cataclastic flow. Kinematic analysis of <b>slip</b> <b>indicators</b> in shear zones further reveals that they formed via north–south shortening. In contrast, the faults cut the shear zones with mixed slip kinematics, and accommodated northwest–southeast shortening, roughly parallel to the modern shortening direction.

Therefore the principle strain axes and stratigraphic section rotated during or postdating development of the major sub-basin (? 5. 6 – 3. 8 Ma) unconformity, a time that generally coincides with a change in the Philippine Sea plate convergence direction. Forearc basin development therefore postdates a protracted geologic evolution of shear-zone development, tectonic rotations, and inner-wedge development, the last of which coincides with a rheological evolution toward localized frictional faulting...|$|R

[...] University of Washington, 2014 Recent {{discoveries in}} {{subduction}} zones worldwide [...] including here in Cascadia [...] have illuminated the once shrouded process of plate convergence below the seismogenic zone. Early geodetic [Dragert, et al., 2001] and seismic [Obara, 2002] signals were observed to correlate {{in space and}} time, and were associated with periodic episodes of deep slow slip, termed Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS) [Rogers and Dragert, 2003]. In this dissertation, I present evidence further detailing the process of where, how, and how often deep slow slip occurs using several catalogs of low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) as slow <b>slip</b> <b>indicators.</b> In the first section I compare four distinct LFE families that span {{the range of the}} ETS zone beneath western Washington State. I find that LFE behavior varies systematically with depth: LFE moments, swarm durations, and swarm recurrence intervals are all largest in the updip portion of the ETS zone, and smallest in the downdip portion. I interpret these systematic differences as a result of variation in fault strength on the subduction interface [...] with the strongest coupling found updip (near the seismogenic zone), and the weakest coupling found downdip. In the second section I look within individual LFE families and perform double-difference event relocations to map out the spatial extent of the LFE patch (or patches) responsible for LFE generation. I determine LFE locking efficiency from estimates of LFE density and released seismic moment. I also track LFE migrations over time in an effort to map the progression of slow slip fronts, rapid tremor reversals (RTRs), and other phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Two {{earthquakes}} ruptured {{the western}} strand of the Saddle Mountain fault after the Cordilleran ice sheet began its {{retreat from the}} Puget Sound Lowland about 17 ka. The fault system includes multiple northeast-trending thrust faults on the southeastern Olympic Peninsula delineated on {{light detection and ranging}} topography by prominent, east-side-up scarps that deform Vashon till and extend over 6 – 7 km. The Cargill Creek Trench on the Saddle Mountain West fault exposed faulted drift and postglacial colluvium below a 1 – 2 m high scarp. Steeply dipping northeast-striking faults form a 10 m wide zone beneath the scarp. Structural relations in the trench indicate that two earthquakes produced at least 1 m of vertical separation. Additional folding or faulting beyond the trench raised the scarp to a total height of 1. 7 m. Aligned cobbles dipping approximately 40 ° to the north attest to earthquake-related tilting. A cobble firmly lodged in till and split by a secondary fault indicates that hanging-wall deformation involved a dextral component of slip. However, slip on the master fault may have involved a left-lateral component based on <b>slip</b> <b>indicators</b> at adjacent trench sites in the region. A single charcoal age and estimates of the onset of ice retreat limit the time of the oldest earthquake to 17 – 7. 7 ka. The most recent event occurred after 1. 7 ka, and may be the same earthquake that dammed Price Lake about 1100 yr ago known from related studies. Empirical relations suggest that the most recent earthquake was about M 7 0 : 2 and produced an estimated total slip of 1. 3 – 1. 7 m. The total postglacial slip rate ranges from 0. 1 to 0 : 3 m=k yr. These results support the hypothesis that the Saddle Mountain fault {{is part of a larger}} fault system that accommodates transpressive strain as the Puget Lowland crust migrates around the eastern flank of the Olympic Mountains...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the <b>slip</b> <b>indicator</b> was {{designed}} and constructed {{for the purpose of}} monitoring the slippage of the tractor powered wheel during the operation of plowing and of applying the output signal to control the draft force acting on the plow. In the previous work conducted by one of the authors, two AC generators were attached to front and rear wheels of the tractor to detect their rotational speed, and the slippage was calculated from the output voltage signal proportional to the rotational speed of the wheels. In the use of this type of slip sensor, some difficulty was found in adjusting and resetting the voltage corresponding to the zero slippage, depending on the running gear prior to the operation. A different type of slip sensor was therefore designed and constructed to remedy this disadvantage. The photo-electric type pulse generator was used to detect the rotational speed of both front and rear wheels through the mechanical amplification by use of gears to obtain the required numbers of pulses per unit rotation of the wheel. The number of pulses generated from the wheels was converted to the frequency and then to the voltage. This output voltage was compared to the set voltage which corresponds to the set slippage. In turn this is properly determined from the relationship between the slippage and the pulling froce expressing the different shape due to the soil condition and running device. The difference between the output voltage and set voltage was amlified. Then the relay connected to the hydraulic directional valve to control lifting and lowering the implement mounted on the three point linkage moved on off, depending on the voltage difference. The slippage calculated from the difference indicated through the monitoring device mounted on the platform located in front of operator's seat. This monitoring device worked quite satisfactorily to help the operator in knowing how much draft force was acting on the implement through the indicated value of the slippage. The field test was done to validate the accurate response and action of the implement under slip draft control in two kinds of fields, sandy and paddy, after harvesting of rice. Through the satisfactory result of the field experiments, it was observed that this type of slip draft control system described here would be possible to apply to a commercial tractor without much modification and improvements. No problems of cost, accuracy or durability for practical use were found...|$|R
40|$|Executive summary: The report {{demonstrates}} that health and wellbeing policies at Royal Mail Group {{have had a}} number of significant and material effects:  Royal Mail Group has successfully tackled the issue of absenteeism (CHAPTER ONE) : Royal Mail achieved significant reductions in absence – from 7 % to 5 % – between January 2004 and May 2007, equivalent to an extra 3, 600 employees in work Parcelforce Worldwide reduced absence from 7 % to 4. 5 % between January 2004 and May 2007 equivalent to an extra 104 employees in work There is a strong link between both organisations’ range of health and wellbeing and absence policies and reductions in absence (based on available data and interviews) Reducing absence has enabled both Royal Mail Group and its Parcelforce Worldwide business unit to make significant cost savings (CHAPTER TWO) : LSE estimates of the annual staff cost of 1 % short-term absence across Royal Mail would be on an annual basis: £ 34. 8 millioniv excluding the cost of replacement labour such as overtime and agency staff / £ 75. 9 million including such costs LSE’s estimates suggest that reducing absence by 2 % between 2004 and 2007 would have contributed to a total saving across Royal Mail Group over the three years of as much as £ 227 millionv in terms of direct costs These estimates are based on the accounting cost of a day’s absence in terms of pay and benefit costs, and use of replacement labour either through agency staff or overtime Reducing absence will have saved at least £ 1. 79 millionvi in direct costs annually for each percentage point reduction in absence in Parcelforce Worldwide Since being introduced in 2004, it is estimated that the policies which led to this 2. 5 % reduction in absence could have contributed to a total saving over the three years of as much as £ 6. 7 vii million in direct costs for Parcelforce Worldwide Controlling absence specifically enables managers at Parcelforce Worldwide to hit their targets more easily (CHAPTER THREE) : It removes unpredictability in meeting profitability targets that managers are set, enabling them to keep unit costs down as well as hit targets for items delivered per day and grow depot net income more easily Across, all depots, reducing absence by 1 % is worth £ 1, 317, 000 to Parcelforce Worldwide annually in terms of meeting net income targetsviii Reducing absence by 1 % takes an average depot £ 2, 300 closer to its daily net income target Tackling absenteeism reduces dependency on replacement labour, including agency staff. The evidence from Parcelforce Worldwide suggests that doing so safeguards performance indicators such as Quality of Service (QoS) and improves net income through bringing costs down (CHAPTER FOUR) : The experience across Parcelforce Worldwide shows that reducing dependence on replacement labour such as agency staff prevents key performance <b>indicators</b> from <b>slipping</b> and strengthens a depot’s bottom line. Reducing absence by 1 % adds more than £ 319, 000 ix annually to net income through reduced dependence on replacement labour This is primarily as a result of: i. Cost savings (replacement labour is expensive) ii. Improved efficiency – analysis suggests agency staff are half as efficient. This is supported by evidence drawn from interviews with managers LSE estimates that that the 2. 5 % reduction in absence achieved by Parcelforce Worldwide between January 2004 and May 2007 would have contributed at least £ 1. 2 millionx to improved net income across the group Reducing absence has a positive effect on Quality of Service (QoS) – a key performance indicator both for Parcelforce Worldwide and for Royal Mail – by around a factor of 12 to one. 7 Improvements in QoS enable Parcelforce Worldwide to capture additional business and improve net income (roughly equivalent to profitability) (CHAPTER FIVE) :  Reducing absence by 2. 5 % between January 2004 and May 2007 would have contributed to a 0. 2 % point increase in QoS all things being equal. i. This figure is derived from estimates relating to the individual depots. It is difficult to draw concrete conclusions about the aggregate movement in QoS across all depots Improvements in QoS enable depots to bring in more business through building a reputation for reliability with customers A 2. 5 % reduction in absence contributes to an improvement in net income of £ 448, 000 annually through improvements in QoS This improvement in net income reflects: i. Greater cost savings through reduced absence ii. Greater efficiency Analysis by LSE suggests that between Jan 2004 and May 2007, improvements in QoS would have contributed at least £ 672, 000 to Parcelforce Worldwide’s annual net income LSE has extrapolated from the example of Royal Mail Group to illustrate the wider benefits to the economy of tackling the issue of health and wellbeing (CHAPTER SIX) Royal Mail’s success in addressing the health and wellbeing of its employees provides an effective blueprint on tackling absence for the 13 worst performing sectors in the UK in terms of absence rates By concentrating on raising attendance in the poorest performing sites and depots and moving them towards average rates of absence, Royal Mail Group has demonstrated a highly effective method for improving the group-wide average absence rate Following the example of Royal Mail Group in addressing the ‘long tail’ of absence and investing in such policies among the 13 sectors in the economy with the highest absence rates would be worth £ 1. 45 billion to the UK economy. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{frictional}} {{behavior of}} a fault and the physical and mechanical properties of the fault rocks {{have important implications for}} earthquake nucleation, propagation and arrest. To further understand the mechanical behavior of carbonate-bearing faults, low- to high-velocity experiments on calcite gouge have been conducted using three rotary-shear apparatus: ROSA, located at the Department of Geosciences of the University of Padua, Italy; SHIVA, at the Istituto Nazionale die Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) in Rome, Italy, and the Phv-apparatus of the Physical Property Research Group of the Kochi Institute for Core Sample Research, Kochi, Japan. Three main topics were addressed with the experimental approach: 1) The formation of clast-cortex aggregates in natural and experimental calcite-bearing fault zones (Chapter I); 2) Localization of strain in gouge layers (Chapter II); and 3) The effect of fluids on the frictional behavior of calcite gouge (Chapter III). Clast-cortex aggregates (CCAs) are composite grains found in the slipping zones of faults hosted in calcite- and clay-rich rocks that were previously suggested to be textural evidence of seismic slip on a fault. Experimental investigation of the dependence of CCA formation in calcite gouge layers on the applied slip rate, normal stress, total displacement and ambient humidity showed that CCAs formed at all investigated slip rates (100 µm/s to 1 m/s) but only at relatively low normal stresses (≤ 5 MPa). The aggregates were better developed with increasing displacement (up to 5 m) and did not form in experiments with water-dampened gouges. In the experiments, aggregates formed in low-strain regions within the gouge layers, adjacent to the highest-strain slip zones. We propose that CCAs in calcite-bearing slip zones form in the shallow portions of faults during shearing in relatively dry conditions, but our experiments suggest that they cannot be used as <b>indicators</b> of seismic <b>slip.</b> Formation involves clast rotation due to granular flow accompanied by accretion of fine matrix material possibly facilitated by electrostatic forces. To further understand strain localization during seismic slip, which is a fundamental mechanical process that has implications for frictional heating and the earthquake energy budget, we performed intermediate- to high-velocity rotary-shear experiments on calcite gouge containing strain markers made of dolomite gouge. Sheared markers should provide microstructural information of the strain distribution in the gouge layer and its dependence on the applied total strain, normal stress, slip rate, and ambient conditions. Microstructural analysis revealed that in both dry and water-dampened gouges strain localization at 1 m/s occurs progressively and rapidly. The strain accommodated in the bulk of the gouge layer does not change significantly with increasing total displacement, suggesting that, once formed, the high-strain slipping zone and principal slip surface accommodate most of the ongoing displacement. This is supported by the presence of sintered and recrystallized grains and zones of calcite decarbonation adjacent to the principal slip surface, indicating localized frictional heating. Faster localization in water-dampened conditions, although suggested by the faster dynamic weakening, was not reflected in the investigated microstructures. Instead, weakening in water-dampened gouges may be enhanced by faster subcritical crack growth in the presence of fluids. When extrapolated to natural conditions, our results suggest that calcite-bearing gouge slip zones are more prone to slip in the presence of water than in relatively dry conditions. The effect of fluids on the frictional behavior of calcite gouge was further investigated by conducting intermediate- to high-velocity experiments with controlled fluid pressure. Consistent with our results from experiments with strain-markers, slip appears to be localized on one or more slip surfaces adjacent to which zones of recrystallization are found. Grey or black material covering the slip surface of several samples was identified as disordered carbon by Raman spectroscopy indicating decarbonation of the calcite. In low-velocity (1 mm/s) experiments, a lower shear stress of water-saturated gouges as compared to room-dry conditions is attributed to intergranular lubrication and to the lower calcite fracture surface energy accelerating subcritical crack growth, consistent {{with a high degree of}} compaction. At the initiation of sliding at high velocity, weakening in saturated gouges occurs abruptly, while the room-dry gouges show a pronounced strengthening phase before the onset of weakening. For a given effective normal stress, the peak stress is lower, and the strengthening phase is longer, for higher pore-fluid factors. The weakening in room-dry and water-saturated gouges sheared at high velocity likely occurs by flash heating, which is accelerated in the presence of fluids by subcritical crack growth. Consistent with flash heating, the presence of carbon on the slipping surface of our calcite samples indicated that decarbonation has occurred even though the bulk temperature of the gouge layer was lower than the decarbonation temperature. At high velocity, intense frictional heating leads to thermal pressurization and subsequent decrease of the shear stress in the experiments performed in undrained conditions. Zones of recrystallized grains adjacent to the principal slip surfaces are possibly featuring microstructures characteristic for grain boundary sliding aided by diffusion creep which suggests that strain was not only accommodated by frictional processes, but possibly by superplasticity. The experimental results suggest that the presence of water in carbonate-bearing faults facilitates earthquake nucleation and even more so if the fluids present are pressurized. This might explain the long-lasting earthquake sequences e. g. of Umbria-Marche and L’Aquila hosted on carbonate-bearing faults. Additionally, some of the slip distribution complexity during earthquakes occurring in carbonate sequences might be due to a difference in the degree of fluid saturation in different fault patches...|$|R
