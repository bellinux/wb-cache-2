5|$|The {{film is a}} {{domestic}} thriller telling of a family's destruction {{by the introduction of}} a sexually predatory femme fatale into the household. A composer has just moved into a two-story house {{with his wife and two}} children. When his wife becomes exhausted from working at a sewing machine to support the family, the composer hires a housemaid to help with the work around the house. The new housemaid behaves strangely, catching rats with her hands, spying on the composer, seducing him and eventually becoming pregnant by him. The composer's wife convinces the housemaid to induce a miscarriage by falling down a flight of stairs. After this incident, the housemaid's behavior becomes increasingly more erratic. She kills the composer's son, and then persuades the composer to commit suicide with her by swallowing rat poison. The film ends with the composer reading the story from a newspaper with his wife. The narrative of the film has apparently been told by the composer, who then warns the film audience that this is <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing could happen to anyone.|$|E
5|$|In the {{cultures}} of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, animal stereotypes grew until {{by the time of}} Virgil, animal epithets could be applied to anything from an abstract concept like love or fear, to a whole civilisation. An author could use an animal's name to emphasise a theme or to provide an overview of a complex epic tale. For example, Homer uses animal similes in the Iliad and the Odyssey, where the lion symbolises qualities such as bravery. This leads up to the lion simile {{at the end of the}} Odyssey, where in Book 22 Odysseus kills all Penelope's suitors. In the Iliad, Homer compares the Trojans to stridulating grasshoppers, which the classicist Gordon Lindsay Campbell believes to imply that they make a lot of noise but are weaker and less determined than they think. In the Aeneid, Book 4, Virgil compares the world of Dido, queen of Carthage, with a colony of ants. Campbell argues that Dido's people are hardworking, strong, unfailingly loyal, organised, and self-regulating: <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> world that the hero Aeneas would like to create. But, Campbell argues, the simile also suggests that Carthage's civilisation is fragile and insignificant, and could readily be destroyed.|$|E

25|$|At the {{northern}} end of the ECR, the unrealised plans would have seen it connect at Hackney Wick to the unbuilt North Cross Route which would have run west across north London via Dalston,and also to the M11 motorway which was originally planned to continue south from its current starting point at the North Circular Road (A406) in South Woodford) to join Ringway 1. Part of this plan was eventually achieved in a modified form when, in the 1990s the 'A12 Hackney to M11 link road', or 'M11 Link Road' was constructed through Leyton, Leytonstone and Wanstead to connect to the ECR at Hackney Wick. This extension was designated as the A12 and required <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> controversial construction methods and widescale demolitions of residential areas that caused the 1960s schemes to be cancelled and provoked to the major M11 link road protest. After the new road was built, {{the northern}} part of the ECR became the A12.|$|E

[...] Saskatchewan Tory MP John Diefenbaker spoke the following day, and alleged that Howe had said, [...] "We may save a million dollars, but what of it?" [...] Howe angrily denied the quote, accusing Diefenbaker of being [...] "a past master of distortion"—language he was forced to withdraw as unparliamentary. Diefenbaker sharpened the anecdote over time, and it emerged in its final form as Howe saying, [...] "What's a million?" [...] Even Liberals who knew that Howe had made no such statement agreed that it was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing he could have said. [...] In the years to come, [...] "What's a million?" [...] would be a mocking Tory attack on the Liberals, most often directed at Howe.|$|E
500|$|These books {{laid the}} {{foundation}} for Marx and Engels's most famous work, a political pamphlet that has since come to be commonly known as The Communist Manifesto. While residing in Brussels in 1846, Marx continued his association with the secret radical organisation League of the Just. As noted above, Marx thought the League to be <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> radical organisation that was needed to spur the working class of Europe toward the mass movement that would bring about a working class revolution. However, to organise the working class into a mass movement the League had to cease its [...] "secret" [...] or [...] "underground" [...] orientation and operate in the open as a political party. Members of the League eventually became persuaded in this regard. Accordingly, in June 1847 the League was reorganised by its membership into a new open [...] "above ground" [...] political society that appealed directly to the working classes. This new open political society was called the Communist League. Both Marx and Engels participated in drawing the programme and organisational principles of the new Communist League.|$|E

ESPNcricinfo praised Kohli for having [...] "demonstrated his growing maturity to play <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> innings his side required", while Kohli described his knock as [...] "a learning innings".

500|$|In 1962, {{the book}} was {{published}} in Britain. Siriol Hugh-Jones wrote for The Times Literary Supplement, [...] "The Phantom Tollbooth is something every adult seems sure will turn into a modern Alice... The obvious {{guess is that the}} appeal of this sort of writing is directed towards <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> adults who derive a perfectly grown-up pleasure from regularly rereading the Alices. As one might expect, it is illustrated by every grown-up's favourite child-like pictures with the built-in sad sophistication, the work of Jules Feiffer." [...] Jennifer Bourdillon reviewed it for The Listener, [...] "This is the story of an imaginary journey, a sort of Pilgrim's Progress of a little boy in his car... One would hardly have thought from the sound of this that it would have so magnetic an appeal, but the brilliant verbal humour and the weird and wonderful characters (the Dodecahedron. the Watchdog, Faintly Macabre) make it that rare delight, a book which parents and children can share." [...] It reached Australia in 1963; The Canberra Times reviewer, J.E.B., deemed it memorable, causing readers to quote from it and leaf through its pages again.|$|E

Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club praised 'Blank Page' and 'Sing for Me', writing that [...] "they are minimal piano ballads on which Aguilera discusses working through regret and reclaiming her sense of self, respectively. The spare music lets her still-powerful voice dominate, and her impassioned delivery conveys how meaningful these songs are to her." [...] Sarah Godfrey of Washington Post commented that the song [...] "is about hackneyed metaphors and big notes — <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> combination that will appeal to fans of Aguilera's signature song 'Beautiful. Idolator critic Mike Wass complimented Aguilera's ability to [...] "tone it down" [...] on the song, but he {{was surprised at the}} level of simplicity considering Furler's [...] "alternative leanings". He did, however, describe it as the album's most straightforward ballad and as a song which could have been written in 1972, with its [...] "with its yearning lyrics and sparse production".|$|E

In other words, properly simulated Gaussian CMB data contain <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> variations claimed.

Sean Gandert of Paste wrote: [...] "I’d {{like to see them}} lay off the contemporary commentary episodes for a bit, but other than that it was exactly what any fan of the show would hope for." [...] Danny Gallagher of TVSquad stated that the episode's [...] "robotic take on the needless hysteria and blatant hypocricy [...] of gay marriage was not only steeped in satiric goodness, but it was downright hilarious."
