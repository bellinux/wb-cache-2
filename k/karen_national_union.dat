25|$|The initial aim of {{the largest}} Karen {{opposition}} group, the <b>Karen</b> <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> (KNU), and its armed wing, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), was to obtain independence for the Karen people. However, since 1976 they have instead called for a federal union with fair Karen representation and the self-determination of the Karen people. Nearly all of their demands and requests have been ignored or denied by successive governments, a contributing factor to failed peace talks until political reforms which begun in 2011 and ended in 2015.|$|E

Both groups had fought the British colonial government prior to independence; however, during {{the final days of}} the Japanese occupation of Burma in World War II, the two groups helped the British fight against the Imperial Japanese Army. Initially, there was calm during the transitional period after independence, but on 2 April 1948, the CPB fired the first shots of the conflict in Paukkongyi, Pegu Region (present-day Bago Region).|$|E

25|$|U Nu, {{after his}} release from prison in October 1966, had left Burma in April 1969, and formed the Parliamentary Democracy Party (PDP) the {{following}} August in Bangkok, Thailand with the former Thirty Comrades, Bo Let Ya, co-founder of the CPB and former Minister of Defence and deputy prime minister, Bo Yan Naing, and U Thwin, ex-BIA and former Minister of Trade. Another member of the Thirty Comrades, Bohmu Aung, former Minister of Defence, joined later. The fourth, Bo Setkya, who had gone underground after the 1962 coup, died in Bangkok shortly before U Nu arrived. The PDP launched an armed rebellion across the Thai border from 1972 till 1978 when Bo Let Ya {{was killed in an}} attack by the <b>Karen</b> <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> (KNU). U Nu, Bohmu Aung and Bo Yan Naing returned to Rangoon after the 1980 amnesty. Ne Win also secretly held peace talks later in 1980 with the KIO and the CPB, again ending in a deadlock as before.|$|E

25|$|Zoya Phan {{was born}} in Manerplaw, then the {{headquarters}} of the <b>Karen</b> <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> (KNU), on 27 October 1980, the second of her parents' three biological children. Her father was Padoh Mahn Sha Lah Phan, General Secretary of the KNU, and her mother was Nant Kyin Shwe, a former soldier for the KNU. Zoya got her unusual name from her father, who named her after the Russian World War II hero Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya because he saw several parallels between the Soviet fight against the Nazis and the Karen struggle against the Burmese government. She spent most of her early life in a Karen village called Per He Lu, an hour's walk away from the KNU headquarters in Manerplaw. When she was six, she began to spend more time in Manerplaw, and it was there she had her first exposure to the fighting in Burma, as land mine victims frequently went to the hospital there for treatment.|$|E
25|$|On 26 June 1954, Douglas DC-3 was hijacked {{by members}} of the Karen National Defense Organization (KNDO, later the Karen National Liberation Army). After the killing of Saw Ba U Gyi in 1950, the first {{president}} of the <b>Karen</b> <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> (KNU), the group sought to regain both a political initiative and financial leverage. Three KNDO members - Major Saw Kyaw Aye, Captain Thein Kyaw and Captain A Nyein - planned to hijack a plane, and use it to smuggle illegal weapons. They successfully hijacked the plane, and forced its British pilot Captain A.E. Hare to land on a deserted beach, after other group members had failed to build a suitable temporary runway in Karen. Finding 700,000 Burmese kyat in metal chests in the cargo, cash being transported between bank branches, they confiscated this and then let the plane take off. Censorship banned reporting of the story for over 50 years, but in April 2014 it was the subject of the book The World's First Hijacking, and is being developed into a Hollywood-produced film under the same title.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{sides have}} been accused of using landmines, which have caused {{hundreds}} of accidental civilian injuries and deaths. The <b>Karen</b> <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> (KNU) has been accused of planting landmines in rural areas, most of which have not been disarmed. The KNU claim that landmines are vital to repelling government forces, because it [...] "discourages them from attacking civilians". However, a majority of those who fall victim to KNU planted landmines are local villagers, rather than government soldiers. Victims of landmines must travel to the Thai-Myanmar border to seek treatment, as local hospitals and facilities lack proper equipment and funding.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{independence}} from the United Kingdom, several anti-colonial groups in Myanmar (Burma) protested against British rule over the country. The groups became especially influential during World War II, when the Empire of Japan promised an [...] "independent Burmese state" [...] (restricted under {{the status of a}} puppet state under Japan) and appointed Ba Maw as its head of state. During this period, left-wing groups such as the Communist Party of Burma (also known as the Burma Communist Party) and ethnic insurgent groups such as the <b>Karen</b> <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> began to emerge in opposition to both the British and Japanese. In 1947, the Panglong Agreement was reached between Aung San and ethnic leaders, in an attempt to quell hostilities; however, the agreement was not honoured by the post-independence government following Aung San's assassination, leading to further ethnic tensions.|$|E
2500|$|After Burma gained {{independence}} in 1948, Kyaw Zaw became famous as the commander who fought and defeated the Kuomintang {{who had fled}} China after the Communist victory in 1949 and had established bases in Burmese territory in the early 1950s. The Kuomintang were supported by the United States and remained in Burma {{for a few years}} in the early 1950s making occasional forays into China to fight the Chinese communists. [...] During the period of [...] 1953 to 1955, under Brigadier General Kyaw Zaw's command the Burmese Army fought [...] the Kuomintang and drove them out of Burmese territory into Thailand. Between 1954 and 1955, Brig.Gen. Kyaw Zaw also successfully led a campaign against the insurgent <b>Karen</b> <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> (KNU) and established central government control in the Karen State. The Prime Minister at the time was U Nu and [...] the Commander in Chief of the Army General Ne Win. Kyaw Zaw was wounded by a shrapnel in his thigh in 1949 during the Battle of Insein when the Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO) laid siege to the capital Rangoon. He was commissioned by Ne Win during the crisis as the commanding officer and Zaw rated this battle as the bitterest with the greatest loss of life in his military career.|$|E
