40|$|Abstract: Catastrophic {{initiation}} of an energetic material {{consists of a}} complex, interactive, sequential train of mechanistic mechanical, physical, and chemical processes which occur over a finite time period and proceed from macroscopic into sub-microscopic composition levels (bulk> crystalline> molecular> atomic). Initiation results when these processes proceed at a rate which generates sufficient energy (heat) to reach a threshold stage within this finite time period. Thus, {{the rate at which}} these mechanistic processes occur defines <b>initiation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and affects performance. Thermochemical decomposition processes regulate the rate at which heat energy is released at the molecular level, and therefore to some extent, control energetic material <b>initiation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and performance characteristics. Kinetic deuterium isotope effect (KDIE) data, obtained during the ambient pressure thermochemical decomposition process, identifies the mechanistic rate-controlling bond rupture which ultimately regulates the energy release rate of a given energetic material. This same rate-controlling bond rupture also appears as a significant rate-limiting feature in higher order deflagration, combustion, and explosion phenomena. The effect the KDIE-determined rate-controlling bond rupture exerts on <b>initiation</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> and its potential influence in combustion and explosion performance is delineated...|$|E

40|$|To gain an atomistic-level {{understanding}} of how compounding the TNT and CL- 20 energetic materials into a TNT/CL- 20 cocrystal might affect the sensitivity, we carried out the compressive–shear reactive molecular dynamics (CS-RMD) simulations. Comparing with the pure crystal of CL- 20, {{we find that the}} cocrystal is much less sensitive. We find that the molecular origin of the energy barrier for anisotropic shear results from steric hindrance toward shearing of adjacent slip planes during shear deformation, which is decreased for the cocrystal. To compare the sensitivity for different crystals, we chose the shear slip system with lowest energy barrier as the most plausible one under external stresses for each crystal. Then we used the temperature rise and molecule decomposition as effective measures to distinguish sensitivities. Considering the criterion as number NO_ 2 fragments produced, we find that the cocrystal has lower shear-induced <b>initiation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> by ∼ 70 % under atmospheric pressure and ∼ 46 % under high pressure (∼ 5 GPa) than CL- 20. Based on the temperature increase rate, the cocrystal has <b>initiation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> lower by 22 % under high pressure (∼ 5 GPa) than CL- 20. These results are consistent with available experimental results, further validating the CS-RD model for distinguishing between sensitive and insensitive materials rapidly (within a few picoseconds of MD) ...|$|E

For crystal directions known to be sensitive we find large stress overshoots and fast temperature increase that result in early bond-breaking processes whereas insensitive directions exhibit small stress overshoot, lower temperature increase, and little bond dissociation.

30|$|Inspired by the {{advantages}} of the method, the nanoscale CL- 20 -based composite was first produced in this paper. The particle size, size distribution, and morphology of the explosives are essential physical characteristics which significantly influence their sensitivities. Explosives with a small particle size, narrow size distribution, and rounded morphology exhibit markedly lowered <b>initiation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and reduced critical diameter. However, it is quite being difficult to produce nanoscale particles from traditional method including solvent-nonsovent recrystallization, sol-gel, and spray drying and supercritical fluid technique [16]. The abovementioned methods are effective at the lab scale, and the large-scale preparation of nanoscale energetic materials involves great difficulties. Mechanical ball milling (also known as ball milling) is a desirable choice because it is suitable for massive and continuous preparation of uniform morphology crystals that maintained the original crystal form.|$|E

40|$|Introduction While {{central nervous}} system {{serotonin}} has been implicated {{in a variety of}} problematic impulsive behaviors, biological manipulation of brain serotonin using acute tryptophan depletion for studying changes in impulsive behavior has received little attention. Methods Using identical treatment conditions, we examined the effects of reduced serotonin synthesis for each of three matched groups using acute tryptophan depletion. Thirty healthy men and women (ages 18 – 45) were assigned to perform one of three tasks assessing different types of behavioral impulsivity: response initiation, response inhibition, and consequence sensitivity (N = 90). Participants completed two experimental days during which each consumed either a tryptophan-depletion or balanced-placebo amino-acid formulation and completed 5 sessions of their respective tasks at 0. 25 h before and 1. 5, 4. 0, 5. 0, and 6. 0 h after beverage consumption. Results During peak effectiveness (5. 0 h to 6. 0 h following amino-acid consumption), depletion produced selective differences dependent on the type of impulsivity being tested. Specifically, relative to baseline testing (pre-depletion), response initiation impulsivity was significantly increased during the peak effects of depletion. And, when compared to placebo control, both response <b>initiation</b> and consequence <b>sensitivity</b> impulsivity were increased during the peak effects of depletion. Conclusion Though response <b>initiation</b> and consequence <b>sensitivity</b> impulsivity were affected by tryptophan depletion, response inhibition impulsivity was not, suggesting that other biological processes may underlie this specific component of impulsivity. Future research in other populations or using different pharmacological agents is warranted to further examine the biological processes underlying these components of impulsivity...|$|R

40|$|To {{meet the}} rising demand for miniaturizing the {{pyrotechnic}} device {{that consists of}} donor/acceptor pair separated by a bulkhead or a thin gap, the shock <b>initiation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in the microscale gap test configuration is investigated. For understanding the shock attenuation within a gap sample (304 stainless steel) thickness of 10 ∼ 800 μm, the laser-generated shock wave in water confinement is adopted. The shock properties are obtained from the free surface velocity by making use of a velocity interferometer system for any reflector (VISAR). Analytical models for plasma generation in a confined geometry and for evolution and decay of shock waves during the propagation are considered. The shape and amplitude of the laser-driven initial pressure load and its attenuation pattern in the gap are effectively controlled for targeting the microscale propagation distance and subsequent triggering pressure for the acceptor charge. The reported results are important in the precise controlling of the shock strength during the laser initiation of microscale pyrotechnic devices...|$|E
40|$|Piston driven {{compaction}} {{waves in}} granular HMX are simulated with a two-dimensional continuum mechanics code in which individual grains are resolved. The constitutive {{properties of the}} grains are modeled with a hydrostatic pressure and a simple elastic-plastic model for the shear stress. Parameters are chosen to correspond to inert HMX. For a tightly packed random grain distribution (with initial porosity of 19 %) we varied the piston velocity to obtain weak partly compacted waves and stronger fully compacted waves. The average stress and wave speed are compatible with the porous Hugoniot locus for uni- axial strain. However, the heterogeneities give rise to stress concentrations, which lead to localized plastic flow. For weak waves, plastic deformation is the dominant dissipative mechanism and leads to dispersed waves that spread out in time. In addition to dispersion, the granular heterogeneities give rise to subgrain spatial variation in the thermodynamic variables.

40|$|Polymer bonded {{explosives}} (PBXs) {{are complex}} composites consisting of explosive crystals in a polymeric binder. The mesostructure of these explosives greatly affects the <b>initiation</b> and <b>sensitivity</b> of the material. As {{the materials are}} prepared in high shear mixers, the initial particles can be damaged and the resulting microstructure is not simply additive from the constituents. Additionally, mechanical loading, such as occurs in a split Hopkinson pressure bar or shock loading experiment, can induce damage, {{which can lead to}} increased sensitivity. Damage may be defined as increased numbers of hot spots, which may be represented microstructurally as increased particle-particle contacts, binder debonding, and creation of new void spaces. These microstructural features may be identified using optical microscopy and X-Ray Computed Microtomography (XCMT). Optical microscopy provides only a two dimensional representation of the material, while XCMT provides three dimensional data. However, the limited contrast between explosive crystals and binder due to their similar densities can make it difficult to perform quantitative characterization on XCMT images. In this study, "as mixed" and explosively loaded samples are compared using quantitative techniques to identify correlations between microstructural features - Including convexity by area and perimeter, grain size distribution, and minimum nearest neighbor distance - and measured run-to-detonation using a custom gap test...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{wellbore}} collapse initiation {{pressure is}} necessary for a robust wellbore bridging study. When drilling overbalance through a porous and permeable formation, there is flow of wellbore fluid into the formation, leaving behind a solid mud cake on the formation. Formation strengthening by drilling fluids has been discussed extensively in the literature. This work attempts to study the coupled effect of mud cake and temperature on the collapse <b>initiation</b> pressure. <b>Sensitivity</b> analysis using unequal horizontal stresses showed {{that the effect of}} mud cake on collapse initiation pressure is not affected by the mud cake compressibility but depends on mud cake thickness, rock unconfined compressive strength, stress level/magnitude and wellbore size. The presence of a mud cake reduces the collapse initiation pressure, making the formation more resistant to collapse. This effect increases as the mud cake thickness, unconfined compressive strength and stress level increase. A decrease in wellbore size also increases the effect of filter cake on collapse initiation pressure. Generally, wellbore heating weakens the formation while cooling strengthens the formation. The presence of a mud cake acts similarly to cooling the wellbore. Coupling the effect of mud cake and temperature showed that the presence of mud cake increases the effect of both wellbore heating and cooling...|$|R

40|$|Fracture in {{amorphous}} glassy polymers involves two {{mechanisms of}} localized deformations: shear yielding and crazing. We here investigate {{the competition between}} these two mechanisms and its consequence on the material’s fracture toughness. The mechanical response of the homogeneous glassy polymer is described by a constitutive law that accounts for its characteristic softening upon yielding and the subsequent progressive orientational strain hardening. The small scale yielding, boundary layer approach is adopted to model the local finite-deformation process {{in front of a}} mode I crack. The concept of cohesive surfaces is used to represent crazes and the traction-separation law incorporates craze initiation, widening and breakdown leading {{to the creation of a}} microcrack. Depending on the craze <b>initiation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the material, crazing nucleates at the crack tip during the elastic regime or ahead of the crack. As the crazes extend, plasticity develops until an unstable crack propagation takes place when craze fibrils start to break down. Thus, the critical width of a craze appears to be a key feature in the toughness of glassy polymers. Moreover, the opening rate of the craze governs the competition between shear yielding and brittle failure by crazing. ...|$|E

40|$|Variable {{warfarin}} response during treatment initiation poses {{a significant}} challenge to providing optimal anticoagulation therapy. We investigated {{the determinants of}} initial warfarin response in a cohort of 167 patients. During the first nine days of treatment with pharmacogenetics-guided dosing, S-warfarin plasma levels and international normalized ratio were obtained to serve as inputs to a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model. Individual PK (S-warfarin clearance) and PD (I(max)) parameter values were estimated. Regression analysis demonstrated that CYP 2 C 9 genotype, kidney function, and gender were independent determinants of S-warfarin clearance. The values for I(max) were dependent on VKORC 1 and CYP 4 F 2 genotypes, vitamin K status (as measured by plasma concentrations of proteins induced by vitamin K absence, PIVKA-II) and weight. Importantly, indication for warfarin was a major independent determinant of I(max) during <b>initiation,</b> where PD <b>sensitivity</b> was greater in atrial fibrillation than venous thromboembolism.

40|$|Analysis of {{the present}} {{situation}} in canine-rabies-infected countries shows that {{in most cases the}} levels of activities for controlling the disease in man and in dogs are far too low to prevent human deaths due to rabies and to eliminate the disease in the dog population. This article compares the two major orientations of a rabies control programme, i. e., prevention of the disease in man by intensifying and modernizing post-exposure treatment (strategy A) and canine rabies elimination by controlling the disease in the animal reservoir (strategy B). The operation of both strategies (A + B) together is also analysed. Based on the available data and assumptions for calculations of the costs, the results show that when the strategies are applied independently of each other, the annual cost of strategy B amounts to 25 - 56 % of that of strategy A. When the two strategies are applied together, the actual annual spending related to the implementation of A + B becomes less than that of strategy A alone as from the fifth year following programme <b>initiation.</b> The <b>sensitivity</b> of the results was tested against selected fluctuations in the assumptions. An estimation of the costs of control activities per avoided death, according to the strategy applied, is also given. In countries where resources allocated to rabies control are inadequate in both the health and veterinary sectors, the comparison in costs and effectiveness of the two programme strategies for rabies elimination strongly suggests that consideration should be given to a national programme of dog rabies elimination. On the other hand, for obvious ethical reasons, if attention is paid to improvement of post-exposure treatment, then the national authorities should consider a planning horizon close to 15 years...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{data have}} shown that type 2 {{diabetes}} patients in the UK delay initiating insulin on average for over 11 years after first being prescribed an oral medication. Using a published computer simulation model of diabetes we used UK-specific data to estimate the clinical consequences of immediately initiating insulin versus delaying initiation for periods in line with published estimates. Methods In the base case scenario simulated patients, with characteristics based on published UK data, were modelled as either initiating insulin immediately or delaying for 8 years. Clinical outcomes {{in terms of both}} life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy and also diabetes-related complications (cumulative incidence and time to onset) were projected over a 35 year time horizon. Treatment effects associated with insulin use were taken from published studies and sensitivity analyses were performed around time to initiation of insulin, insulin efficacies and hypoglycaemia utilities. Results For patients immediately initiating insulin there were increases in (undiscounted) life expectancy of 0. 61 years and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0. 34 quality-adjusted life years versus delaying initiation for 8 years. There were also substantial reductions in cumulative incidence and time to onset of all diabetes-related complications with immediate versus delayed insulin <b>initiation.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> analyses showed that a reduced delay in insulin initiation or change in insulin efficacy still demonstrated clinical benefits for immediate versus delayed initiation. Conclusion UK type 2 diabetes patients are at increased risk {{of a large number of}} diabetes-related complications due to an unnecessary delay in insulin initiation. Despite clear guidelines recommending tight glycaemic control this failure to begin insulin therapy promptly is likely to result in needlessly reduced life expectancy and compromised quality of life. </p...|$|E

Adherence (proportion of days covered (PDC) ≥ 0. 80), discontinuation (90 -day continuous gap), and switching (initiation of second biologic within 90 days of discontinuation date of index biologic) were measured during the 12 -month postindex biologic <b>initiation.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> analyses were conducted by varying the thresholds to define these measures. Logistic regressions examined the factors associated with RA biologic adherence and discontinuation. ResultsAnakinra users had the lowest mean PDC (0. 36) and percent adherent patients (11 %) followed by etanercept users (mean PDC: 0. 57; % adherent: 32 %) and infliximab users (mean PDC: 0. 64; % adherent: 43 %). All three groups had high discontinuation rates (41 % etanercept, 76 % anakinra, and 41 % infliximab). Few patients who discontinued the index biologic switched to another biologic. Logistic regressions found that patients in Florida had lower odds of being adherent and higher odds of discontinuing their index biologic than patients in California. Anakinra users had lower odds and infliximab users had higher odds of being adherent than etanercept users. Anakinra users had higher odds of discontinuation than etanercept users.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{explosive}} science, {{the existence of the}} ‘hot-spot’ is generally accepted as essential to any theory on shock initiation. Continuum-based shock initiation models only account for ‘hot-spots’ implicitly, and the majority of these models use pressure-dependent reaction rates. The development of a simple but physically realistic model to predict desensitisation (double shock) effects within the confines of an existing pressure-based model is described and simulations compared with experimental data with mixed results. The need to invoke a separate desensitisation model for double shocks demonstrates that reaction rates are not substantially dependent on local pressure. The newly developed continuum, entropy-dependent, CREST model has been implemented and validated in a number of hydrocodes. However, the move to entropy-based reaction rates introduces a number of computational problems not associated with pressure-based models. These problems are described, in particular, an entropy-dependent model over-predicts the rate of energy release in an explosive adjacent an impact surface, and requires a finer mesh than a pressure-dependent model to achieve mesh converged results. The CREST model, fitted only to onedimensional data of the shock to detonation transition, is shown to be able to accurately simulate two-dimensional detonation propagation data. This gives confidence in the predictive capability of the model. To account for ‘hot-spots’ explicitly, a simple model to describe ‘hot-spot’ initiation has been developed. The simple model is presented where ‘hot-spots’ are formed as a result of elastic-viscoplastic stresses generated in the solid explosive during pore collapse. Results from the model compare well with corresponding results from direct numerical simulations, and both are consistent with observations and commonly held ideas regarding the shock <b>initiation</b> and <b>sensitivity</b> of heterogeneous solid explosives. The results also indicate that viscoplastic ‘hot-spot’ models described in the literature are built on an invalid assumption. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Of 253 smear-negative TB suspects, 56 % (142 / 253) were females, median age 38 IQR (31 - 44) years, with a median CD 4 cell count of 291 IQR (150 - 482) cells/mm(3).

Aim: To investigate the {{relationship of}} EF and ToM deficits via a data-driven approach in a large sample of patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD).

Results: Overall results showed that EF measures were clustered separately from the ToM measure. A post hoc analysis revealed a more complex picture where selected ToM subcomponents (empathy; intention) showed a relationship to specific EF measures (verbal abstraction; working memory/attention), whereas the remaining EF and ToM subcomponents were separate. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings suggest that EF and ToM are distinct components; however, ToM empathy and intention subcomponents might share some functions with specific EF processes. This has important implications for guiding diagnostic assessment of these deficits in clinical conditions...|$|R
40|$|Firstly, recently, {{there are}} a lot of {{techniques}} being demanded for complex process, various explosive initiation method and highly accurate control of detonation are needed. In this research, the metal foil explosion using high current is focused attention on the method to obtain linear or planate initiation easily, and the main evaluation of metal foil explosion to initiate explosive was conducted. The explosion power was evaluated by observing optically the underwater shock wave generated from the metal foil explosion. Secondly, in high energy explosive processing, there are several applications, such as shock compaction, explosive welding, food processing and explosive forming. In these explosive applications, a high sensitive explosive has been mainly used. The high sensitive explosive is so dangerous, since it can lead to explosion suddenly. So, for developing explosives, the safety is the most important thing as well as low manufacturing cost and explosive characteristics. In this work, we have focused on the <b>initiation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of a solid explosive and performed numerical analysis of sympathetic detonation. The numerical analysis is calculated by LS-DYNA 3 D (commercial code). To understand the initiation reaction of an explosive, Lee-Tarver equation was used and impact detonation process was analyzed by ALE code. Configuration of simulation model is a quarter of circular cylinder. The donor type of explosive (SEP) was used as initiation explosive. When the donor explosive is exploded, a shock wave is generated and it propagates into PMMA, air and metallic layers in order. During passing through the layers, the shock wave is attenuated and finally, it has influence on the acceptor explosive, Comp. B. Here, we evaluate the initiation of acceptor explosive and discuss about detonation pressure, reactive rate of acceptor explosive and attenuation of impact pressure...|$|E
40|$|CD 8 + {{regulatory}} (suppressor) T {{cells are}} induced by complex cellular pathways in the spleens of mice that have received an injection of antigen into the anterior chamber (AC) of an eye, an immune-privileged site. Although these CD 8 + regulatory T cells perform an antigen-specific regulatory function for an immune response to self and non-self antigens, {{the mechanisms of}} the activation or function of these regulatory cells are not clear. Here, we describe a novel mechanism for the activation of splenic CD 8 + regulatory T cells induced by injection of antigen into the AC. Immunization of mice with trinitrophenyl and bovine serum albumin (TNP-BSA) amplified AC-induced splenic CD 8 + regulatory T cells that suppressed the <b>initiation</b> of contact <b>sensitivity</b> when transferred to immunized, challenged mice. These CD 8 + regulatory T cells were produced independently of perforin, indicating {{that they are not}} canonical cytotoxic T cells. Fas ligand (FasL) -deficient CD 8 + regulatory T-cell function was rescued by inclusion of exogenous interferon-γ (IFN-γ), demonstrating that the expression of FasL by CD 8 + regulatory T cells was dispensable, but IFN-γ was not. Ultimately, we demonstrated that the generation of these CD 8 + regulatory T cells occurred independently of IFN-γ, but their suppressor function required IFN-γ receptor stimulation...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} {{a review of the}} rat liver foci {{bioassay}} which is an initiationlpromotion assay that utilizes preneoplastic foci of hepatocytes possessing altered enzymatic activity and altered cellular constituents as indicators of carcinogenesis. Rat liver tumor promoters that have been employed in the assay in-clude: (I) a low level of 2 -acetylaminofluorene in the diet, (2) phenobarbital in the diet and drinking water and (3) a choline deficient diet. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-positive, and adenosine triphosphatase, and gfucose- 6 -phosphatase-defi-cient foci are used to indicate the initiation of cancer and are reviewed with respect to their relationship to cancer. Partial hepatectomy at the time of <b>initiation</b> increases the <b>sensitivity</b> of the assay to dialkylnitrosamines and chemicals which are otherwise negative in rat liver. The protocols being developed by the Health Effects Research laboratory in Cincinnati in-clude: (1) partial hepatectomy either 18 hours prior to or 14 days after administering the chemical under test, (2) pheno-barbital promotion and (3) using gamma-glutamyl transpepti-dase-positive foci as the indicator of carcinogenesis. The article also reviews the rat liver foci bioassay as a component of the Carcinogenesis Testing Matrix for tier I / where it will be em-ployed to confirm the carcinogenic hazard associated with en-vironmental samples containing complex mixtures...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that rapid range expansion could proceed through evolution in the endocrinological machinery controlling life-history switches. Based on this we tested whether the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, which has rapidly expanded its range across latitudinal regions in Europe, and shows photoperiodic adaptation in overwintering <b>initiation,</b> has different <b>sensitivities</b> to juvenile hormone (JH) manipulation along a latitudinal gradient. Results: A factorial experiment where beetles were reared either under a long or short day photoperiod was performed. Hormone levels were manipulated by topical applications. An allatostatin mimic, H 17, was used to decrease and a juvenile hormone III analogue, pyriproxyfen, was used to increase the hormone levels. The effects of photoperiod and hormone manipulations on fecundity and overwintering related burrowing were monitored. Application of H 17 decreased fecundity but did not induce overwintering related burrowing. Manipulation with pyriproxyfen increased fecundity and delayed burrowing. While small population-dependent differences in responsiveness to the topical application treatments were observed in fecundity, none were seen in overwintering related burrowing. Conclusions: The results indicate that the rapid photoperiodic adaptation manifested in several life-history and physiological traits in L. decemlineata in Europe is unlikely a result of population dependent differences in JH III sensitivity. While other endocrine factors cannot be ruled out, more likely mechanisms could be genetic changes in upstream elements, such as the photoperiodic clock or the insulin signaling pathway...|$|R
40|$|Scour {{has been}} {{identified}} as one of the main causes of bridge failures in Australia and worldwide. Accurate estimation of scour around bridge piers is challenging as it requires a comprehensive analysis of the interactions between fluid, soil and bridge structure. The mechanism of scour is influenced by many factors including geometry of the channel, dynamic properties of the flow, soil conditions, geometry of the bridge piers and abutments. Numerical modeling of flow around bridge pier using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is fundamental step in determining the effective parameters that control sediment removal around the pier and scouring of the bed. This study aims to investigate the effect of key parameters such as flow velocity, flow depth and sediment coarseness on scour <b>initiation</b> through a <b>sensitivity</b> analysis. A multi-interaction numerical model is developed using CFD package Fluent 16, and prediction of upstream and downstream velocities is validated against experimental data. The developed model is used to generate bed shear stress data for a number of clear water scenarios for sandy bed in order to investigate the effect of different parameters on the scoured area. Results show that the mean flow velocity, characterized by the Froude number, has a dominant effect in controlling scour initiation among the variables considered in the current study. These results also form the basis for development of a closed form analytic model for estimating scour around bridge piers against the wave loading...|$|R
40|$|The {{ground-breaking}} manuscript on chemical sensi-tivity symptoms by Kreutzer et al. (1) brings {{some long}} overdue rigor to the epidemiology {{of what has}} come to be called multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). It also provides an opportunity to highlight work important to public health in an overlooked field, that of medically unexplained somatic symptoms. MCS along with other syndromes associated with unexplained somatic symptoms often receives rela-tively short scientific shrift. Symptoms (e. g., headache, fatigue, trouble concen-trating) account for a high proportion of medical encounters, and a surprising majority are not explained by pathologic medical conditions (2, 3). Rather than simply dismiss these "unexplained symptoms, " over at least the past two decades, practitioners and patients have coalesced these symptoms into syndromes including chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyal-gia (FM), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), atypical connective tissue disease after silicone breast implants, chronic hypoglycemia, sick building syndrome (non-specific building related illness), MCS, and, most recently, Gulf War Illness. Some of the names, such as CFS, do not imply etiology or pathophysiology, while others, such as MCS, invoke chemical triggering of symptomatic episodes as well as the often implied chemical <b>initiation</b> of the <b>sensitivity.</b> Investigators have pointed out the substantial overlap between one unexplained symptom classification and another, such that 30 - 50 percent of individuals with CFS, FM, and MCS qualify (based on self-report of symptoms) for at least one of the other diagnoses (4, 5). All are unex-plained because, despite many theories and hypothe-ses, there is no acceptance by the medical community Received for publication October 16, 1998, and accepted for pub...|$|R
