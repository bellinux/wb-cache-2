40|$|Opisthobranchs, a {{group of}} brightly colored mollusks, are found {{globally}} in marine environments including in the pacific coast intertidal zone. The ease of detection and high diversity of opisthobranchs make them an ideal study subject to compare populations <b>in</b> marine <b>protected</b> areas to unprotected locations. I hypothesized that opisthobranchs would be larger, more abundant and have high diversity <b>in</b> <b>protected</b> areas. To assess this assumption I conducted nine hour long surveys of the tide pools in two MPAs and two unprotected locations in north central California recording species, size and number of individuals. From a time series analysis no difference was found between diversity at protected and unprotected sites however overall more species were seen <b>in</b> <b>protected</b> areas than unprotected areas. Finally, from a one-way AN OVA dorid opisthobranchs were significantly larger <b>in</b> <b>protected</b> areas compared to unprotected areas. These results indicate some benefits for opisthobranchs living <b>in</b> <b>protected</b> areas...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the cavalry}} had been {{successful}} <b>in</b> <b>protecting</b> the park, by 1914 the average soldier was not cutout for the strenuous, diplomatic and tedious {{nature of the}} work, and {{the high level of}} training related to cavalry skills. World War I added further impetus to a transition back to civilian management, to relieve the army of a duty that could be performed by civilian rangers. In July 1914, the 1st Cavalry was withdrawn from Yellowstone and replaced with a composite unit of 200 cavalrymen from throughout the army, many of whom had served in Yellowstone previously.|$|E

Looters managed to enter during the night from the roof to damage a number of small artifacts, and it was initially reported that they had ripped the heads off two mummies, but subsequent reports claimed that Egypt's top archaeologist had mistaken skulls from other skeletons, and that the mummies were intact.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the roles}} and {{importance}} of {{the various forms of}} vitamin E are presently unclear, and it has even been suggested that the most important function of α-tocopherol is as a signaling molecule, with this molecule having no significant role in antioxidant metabolism.

5|$|Jordan {{is a key}} ally of the USA and UK and, {{together}} with Egypt, {{is one of only}} two Arab nations to have signed peace treaties with Israel, Jordan's direct neighbour. Jordan views an independent Palestinian state with the 1967 borders, as part of the two-state solution and of supreme national interest. The ruling Hashemite dynasty has had custodianship over holy sites in Jerusalem since 1924, a position re-inforced in the Israel–Jordan peace treaty. Turmoil in Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque between Israelis and Palestinians created tensions between Jordan and Israel concerning the former's role <b>in</b> <b>protecting</b> the Muslim and Christian sites in Jerusalem.|$|E

By the 13th century there was a well-established system of castle-guards in place, under which various lands around York were granted in return for the provision of knights and crossbowmen to assist <b>in</b> <b>protecting</b> the castle.|$|E
