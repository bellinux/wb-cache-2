5|$|Although wolf-dog {{hybridization}} in Europe {{has raised}} concern among conservation groups fearing for the gray wolf's purity, genetic tests show that introgression of dog genes into European gray wolf populations does {{not pose a}} significant threat. Also, as wolf and dog mating seasons <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> coincide, the likelihood of wild wolves and dogs mating and producing surviving offspring is small.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham is chiefly {{a product}} of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries; its growth began during the Industrial Revolution. Consequently, {{relatively}} few buildings survive from its earlier history and those that do are protected. There are 1,946 listed buildings in Birmingham and thirteen scheduled ancient monuments. Birmingham City Council also operate a locally listing scheme for buildings that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> meet the criteria for statutorily listed status.|$|E
5|$|The {{mayor and}} council set local taxes and a budget, {{which must be}} {{approved}} by Congress. The Government Accountability Office and other analysts have estimated that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the Congressional prohibition of commuter taxes create a structural deficit in the District's local budget of anywhere between $470million and over $1billion per year. Congress typically provides additional grants for federal programs such as Medicaid and the operation of the local justice system; however, analysts claim that the payments <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> resolve the imbalance.|$|E

5|$|While most {{types of}} temnospondyls are {{distinguished}} {{on the basis}} of features in mature specimens, several are known from juvenile and larval specimens. Metamorphosis is seen in dissorophoids, eryopids, and zatrachydids, with aquatic larvae developing into adults capable of living on land. Several types of dissorophoids <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> metamorphose, but retain features of juveniles such as gills and small body size in what is known as neoteny. Dvinosaurians and the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax were also neotenic because they retained gills, but they are only known from adult specimens.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the emergentist {{coalition}} model argue that, as a hybrid, {{this model}} moves towards a more holistic explanation of word learning {{that is not}} captured by models with a singular focus. For instance, constraints theories typically argue that constraints/principles are available to children from the onset of word learning, but do not explain how children develop into expert speakers who are not limited by constraints. Additionally, some argue that domain-general perspectives <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> {{address the question of}} how children sort through numerous potential referents in order to correctly sort out meaning. Lastly, social pragmatic theories claim that social encounters guide word learning. Although these theories describe how children become more advanced word learners, they seem to tell us little about children's capacities at the start of word learning. According to its proponents, the emergentist coalion model incorporates constraints/principles, but argues for the development and change in these principles over time, while simultaneously taking into consideration social aspects of word learning alongside other cues, such as salience.|$|E
25|$|Language-nonselective {{access is}} the {{automatic}} co-activation {{of information in}} both linguistic systems. It implies that when a bilingual encounters a spoken or written word, the activation happens in both contextually appropriate and inappropriate linguistic subsystems. Also, {{there is evidence that}} bilinguals take longer than monolinguals to detect non-words while in both bilingual and monolingual modes, providing evidence that bilinguals <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> inactivate their other language while in a monolingual mode.|$|E

25|$|The {{representation}} of tone. Most non-linguistic transcriptions of Mixtec <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> record the tones. When tone is represented, acute accent over the vowel is typically used to indicate high tone. Mid tone is sometimes indicated with a macron over the vowel, {{but it may}} be left unmarked. Low tone is sometimes indicated with a grave accent overt the vowel, but it might be left unmarked, or it might be indicated with an underscore to the vowel.|$|E

In their homeland, the Hmong had a different hunting culture, and most lands were government-owned and therefore open to subsistence hunting, as in other third world countries. Regional officials in Wisconsin and Minnesota have focused on educating Hmong hunters on private property rights to diminish the risk of future conflicts.|$|E

In practice indigenous people <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> participate in the management of their lands or natural resources, in part because responsibility for implementing the law is delegated to the 23 provinces, only 11 of which have constitutions recognizing indigenous rights.|$|E

Some of it is taken up by off-street parking, some of it is left undeveloped as lawns and parks, and a tennis court has been built on John Street between Franklin and Green (complemented by two others just outside the district).|$|E

In most cases, higher taxonomic groupings arise further back in time: {{not because the}} rate of diversification was higher in the past, but because each subsequent diversification event results in an increase of diversity and thus increases the taxonomic rank assigned by present-day taxonomists. Furthermore, some groups have many described species {{not because they are}} more diverse than other species, but because they are more easily sampled and studied than other group.|$|E

25|$|Walter's work is {{documented}} {{on hundreds of}} recordings made between 1900 (when he was 24) and 1961. Most listeners became familiar with him through the stereo recordings made in his last few years, when his health was declining. But many critics agree that these recordings <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> convey what Walter's art must have sounded like in its prime. The late recordings {{are said to have}} a geniality that contrast with the energetic, intense and mercurial performances of earlier decades. Furthermore, Walter's late recordings focus mostly on older compositions, whereas in his youth he often conducted what was then considered newer music.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} runs {{a number}} of public elementary and secondary-level schools, as youth in Guatemala <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> participate in education. These schools are free, though the cost of uniforms, books, supplies, and transportation makes them less accessible to the poorer segments of society and significant numbers of poor children do not attend school. Many middle and upper-class children go to private schools. Guatemala has one public university (USAC or Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala), and fourteen private ones (see List of universities in Guatemala). USAC was the first university in Guatemala {{and one of the}} first Universities of America.|$|E
25|$|Impacted wisdom teeth (or {{impacted}} third molars) are wisdom teeth which <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> erupt {{into the}} mouth because of blockage from other teeth (impaction). If the wisdom teeth {{do not have an}} open connection to the mouth, pain can develop with the onset of inflammation or infection or damage to the adjacent teeth. Common accepted hypothesis that determine eruption is the angle at which the 3rd molars sit, the stage of root formation of 3rd molars at the point of screening, depth of impaction, how much room there is for eruption as well as the size of the 3rd molar.|$|E

25|$|Andrade {{goes on to}} {{question}} whether or not Europeans would have developed large artillery pieces {{in the first place}} had they faced Chinese style walls so resistant to projectiles, coming to the conclusion that such exorbitant investments in weapons unable to serve their primary purpose would not have been ideal. Yet Chinese walls <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> explain the divergence in gun development as European guns grew not only bigger, but more effective as well. By 1490 the European gun had achieved the basic form it would take for the next three centuries, during which it would dominate the fields of warfare. The Classic Gun had arrived, and in the 1510s and 1520s when the Chinese encountered European firearms, they fully recognized they were superior to their own.|$|E
25|$|Ideally, campfires {{should be}} made in a fire ring. If a fire ring is not available, a {{temporary}} fire site may be constructed. Bare rock or unvegetated ground is ideal for a fire site. Alternatively, turf may be cut away to form a bare area and carefully replaced after the fire has cooled to minimize damage. Another way is to cover the ground with sand, or other soil mostly free of flammable organic material, {{to a depth of}} a few inches. A ring of rocks is sometimes constructed around a fire. Fire rings, however, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> protect material on the ground from catching fire. Flying embers are still a threat, and the fire ring may become hot enough to ignite material in contact with it, or the rocks could crack.|$|E
25|$|Ryder {{used his}} {{materials}} liberally and without care. His paintings, which he often worked on {{for ten years}} or more, were built up of layers of paint and varnish applied {{on top of each}} other. He would often paint into wet varnish, or apply a layer of fast-drying paint over a layer of slow-drying paint. The result is that paintings by Ryder remain unstable and become much darker over time; they crack readily, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> dry even after decades, and sometimes completely disintegrate. Because of this, and because some Ryder paintings were completed or reworked by others after his death, many Ryder paintings appear very different today than they did when first created. Many of his paintings suffered damage even during Ryder's lifetime, and he tried to restore them in his later years.|$|E
