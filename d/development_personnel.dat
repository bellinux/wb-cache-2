Some of the most important conclusions which were reached from the literature study and the empirical investigation are the following: - <b>Personnel</b> <b>development</b> can be {{regarded as one of the}} most important aspects within any organization to promote organizational effectiveness. - Organizational effectiveness can only be achieved if the career objectives of the individual match and complement those of the organization. - The implementation of programmes and methods such as a career development programme, assessment centres, mentoring, quality control circles, induction programmes and metacognition can make a positive contribution to organizational effectiveness. - A healthy organizational climate including effective communication, plays an important role in promoting <b>personnel</b> <b>development</b> and improving organizational effectiveness. The following are a few of the most important recommendations arising from the investigation: - <b>Personnel</b> <b>development</b> programmes should be offered on a continuing basis at technikons. - Career development programmes aimed at the individual should be introduced at technikons. - The technikon leader corps should receive training in the different facets of <b>personnel</b> <b>development.</b> - Open communication channels within technikons as organizations should be promoted. - Technikon personnel should be prepared to adapt to changing objectives. - The introduction of career development programmes, assessment centres, induction programmes, mentoring, quality control circles, and metacognition must be seriously considered as methods of <b>personnel</b> <b>development</b> to promote organizational effectiveness at technikons in the RSA.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} if, and to what extent, management of nursing colleges enhanced <b>personnel</b> <b>development</b> with regard to the professional and personal development of nurse educators and clinical preceptors. From the literature survey, it was concluded that an effective <b>personnel</b> <b>development</b> programme that included all nursing personnel involved in the education and training of student nurses, was imperative for the rendering of continuous quality nursing education. The importance of co-operation between management of nursing colleges and nursing management of clinical facilities regarding the <b>development</b> of <b>personnel</b> involved in the education and training of student nurses, was emphasised. A programme for <b>personnel</b> <b>development</b> in nursing colleges was developed. The programme included suggestions for the educational development of both nurse educators and clinical preceptors/ registered nurses involved in the education and training of student nurses. It was suggested that nursing colleges should initiate the programme. Research consisted of an in-depth literature review about the management of <b>personnel</b> <b>development</b> in the educational milieu and a survey with regard to the management of the <b>development</b> of <b>personnel</b> involved in the education and training of student nurses. Principals of nursing schools, nursing educators, nursing directors of health services and clinical preceptors in clinical settings formed the population for the study. The theoretical framework used in this research with regard to <b>personnel</b> <b>development</b> in nursing schools, was Donabedian's theory on structural, process and outcomes standards as applied to quality improvement, as well as Alspach's theoretical foundation of nursing staff development. The focus of this study was to use data generated through research to develop a <b>personnel</b> <b>development</b> programme for all registered nurses involved in the education and training of student nurses. The most important conclusions of this research were as follows: &# 61623; <b>Personnel</b> <b>development</b> was provided for nurse educators and clinical preceptors/ registered nurses involved in the education and training of student nurses in the clinical setting, but it did not necessarily meet the personal and professional developmental needs of these professionals. &# 61623; The specific developmental needs of nurse educators and clinical preceptors/ registered nurses were related to educational skills, higher cognitive skill and skills related to research. &# 61623; Available resources at nursing colleges did not facilitate and support the development of nurse educators and clinical preceptors involved in the education and training of student nurses. The main conclusion was that the establishment of a Department of <b>Personnel</b> <b>Development</b> at nursing colleges could provide for the educational needs of both nurse educators and clinical preceptors/ registered nurses, would benefit the personal and professional development of all learners involved and, ulitmately, would enhance the quality of patient care rendered by student nurses.
