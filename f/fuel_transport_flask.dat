40|$|Neutron {{detectors}} in fusion devices {{need to be}} calibrated {{to provide}} the absolute neutron yield and the fusion power produced in fusion reactions. A new in-situ calibration of the JET neutron detectors was recently performed using a 252 Cf neutron source with intensity of about 2. 7 ox 108 n/s. The source was delivered to the JET facility within a <b>Transport</b> <b>Flask</b> and the surface radiation levels must fall within transport regulations. Some contingency scenarios required transfer of the source into special shields: the Operational Shield and the Auxiliary Shield. In this paper we describe the neutron calculations that {{have been carried out}} to evaluate the dose rate leakage from the shields which may contain the neutron source. The calculations have been performed using accurate modelling of the neutron and gamma ray emission from the 252 Cf source, and from the three shields. The differences on calculated dose rates deriving from the use of different flux-to-dose conversion factors have also been investigated. A comparison of dose rates calculated and measured is presented from the bare source (in cell) and with the source within its <b>Transport</b> <b>Flask...</b>|$|R

40|$|A flux chamber was {{designed}} to measure the transient <b>fuel</b> <b>transport</b> through a foam layer before significant degradation of foam occurred. The <b>fuel</b> <b>transport</b> rate through AFFF (fluorinated foam) was much slower than through RF 6 (fluorine-free foam) with break-through times being 820 s and 276 s respectively over n-heptane. The fuel flux through AFFF covering three fuel pools (n-heptane, iso-octane, and methyl-cyclohexane) was also measured. AFFF had the smallest flux over iso-octane with a break-through time over 1900 s and the highest flux over methyl-cyclohexane with a break-through time under 80 s even though the fuels have similar vapor pressures at room temperature. Despite the lack of aqueous film formation on an iso-octane fuel pool, the fuel vapor flux through AFFF was much smaller relative to the methyl-cyclohexane pool, which enables film formation due to its higher surface tension than iso-octane. Our measurements of transient fuel flux show that the foam layer is a significant barrier to <b>fuel</b> vapor <b>transport.</b> The data suggest a transient mechanism based on the suppression of fuel adsorption onto bubble lamellae surfaces due to the oleophobicity of fluorocarbon surfactants, {{which is consistent with}} fuel solubility data. This suggests that surfactants that suppress fuel adsorption and solubility into bubble lamellae surfaces may reduce <b>fuel</b> <b>transport</b> through foams...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Energy {{security}} {{and climate change}} are forcing China to change its inappropriate energy structure. Today, transport is the second largest energy consumer in China. No single method can achieve a fossil <b>fuel</b> independent <b>transport</b> and {{it is necessary to}} propose a comprehensive strategy which can benefit both transport and the energy system. This paper aims to evaluate different transport development strategies in terms of their effects on fossil fuel demand reduction and to explore to what extent renewable energy can contribute to the transport sector. With this objective, three investigations were carried out in sequence. Firstly, a Chinese transport model has been created and approach reliability has been examined. Secondly, two scenarios, continued improvement (CI) scenario and accelerated improvement (AI) scenario, have been designed and evaluated. The results indicate that evident fuel demand reduction can be achieved by formulated transport development planning but more alternative technologies and joint actions are needed in order to change the fuel structure. Finally, 100 % non-fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>transport</b> was built up and analysed. The challenges of a transfer to a 100 % non-fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>transport</b> in China are not severe at least in the perspectives of domestic biofuels potential and transmission capacity...|$|R
