40|$|The paper {{describes}} a new algorithm for tomographic source reconstruction in neural electromagnetic inverse problems. Termed <b>FOCUSS</b> (FOCal Underdetermined System Solution), this algorithm combines the desired {{features of the}} two major approaches to electromagnetic inverse procedures. Like multiple current dipole modeling methods, <b>FOCUSS</b> produces high resolution solutions appropriate for the highly localized sources often encountered in electromagnetic imaging. Like linear estimation methods, <b>FOCUSS</b> allows current sources to assume arbitrary shapes and it preserves the generality and ease of application characteristic of this group of methods. It stands apart from standard signal processing techniques because, as an initialization-dependent algorithm, it accommodates the non-unique set of feasible solutions that arise from the neuroelectric source constraints. <b>FOCUSS</b> is based on recursive, weighted norm minimization. The consequence of the repeated weighting procedure is, in effect, to concentrate the solution in the minimal active regions that are essential for accurately reproducing the measurements. The <b>FOCUSS</b> algorithm is introduced and its properties are illustrated {{in the context of a}} number of simulations, first using exact measurements in 2 - and 3 -D problems, and then in the presence of noise and modeling errors. The results suggest that <b>FOCUSS</b> is a powerful algorithm with considerable utility for tomographic current estimation.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we develop}} robust methods for subset {{selection}} {{based on the}} minimization of diversity measures. A Bayesian framework is used to account for noise in the data and a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation procedure leads to an iterative procedure which is a regularized version of the FOCal Underdetermined System Solver (<b>FOCUSS)</b> algorithm. The convergence of the regularized <b>FOCUSS</b> algorithm is established and it is shown that the stable fixed points of the algorithm are sparse. We investigate three different criteria for choosing the regularization parameter: quality of fit, sparsity criterion, and-curve. The-curve method, as applied {{to the problem of}} subset selection, is found not to be robust, and we propose a novel modified-curve procedure that solves this problem. Each of the regularized <b>FOCUSS</b> algorithms is evaluated through simulation of a detection problem, and the results are compared with those obtained using a sequential forward selection algorithm termed orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). In each case, the regularized <b>FOCUSS</b> algorithm is shown to be superior to the OMP in noisy environments.

In this method, {{in order to further}} improve its performance, a predictive frame is first obtained using the Motion Estimation (ME) and Motion Compensation (MC) algorithms, and the quality of reconstructed images can then be enhanced by the study of sparsity of the residuals based on the improved predictive frame. However, traditional MC algorithm usually causes block artifacts. In this work, an Overlapped Block Motion Compensation (OBMC) scheme was used to overcome this problem. Two reference frames, located at systole and diastole periods, were both acquired to improve the predication accuracy.

40|$|Recently, a model based dynamic imaging {{algorithm}} called k-t BLAST/SENSE {{has drawn}} significant attentions from MR imaging community {{due to its}} improved spatio-temporal resolution for dynamic MR imaging. In our previous work, we proved that k-t BLAST/SENSE can be derived {{as the first step}} of FOCal Underdetermined System Solver (<b>FOCUSS)</b> that exploits the sparsity of x-f support. Furthermore, the newly derived algorithm called k-t <b>FOCUSS</b> can be shown optimal from compressed sensing perspective. In this paper, the k-t <b>FOCUSS</b> algorithm is extended to radial trajectory. More specifically, the radial data are transformed to Cartesian domain implicitly during the <b>FOCUSS</b> iterations without explicit gridding to prevent error propagation. Thanks to the implicit gridding that allows fast Fourier transform, we can reduce the computational burden significantly. Additionally, a novel concept of motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC) is proposed to improve the performance of the algorithm significantly. In our ME/MC framework, we additionally obtain one reference sinogram with the full view, then the reference signogram is subtracted from all the radial data. Then, we can apply motion estimation / motion compensation (ME/MC) to improve the final reconstruction.
