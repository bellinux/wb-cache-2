The current house was built on or close to the site of a hospital of the Order of St Lazarus of Jerusalem, which was in existence at least as far back as 1296. The order was dedicated to the care of lepers, and the name Locko derives from the old French word for rags, loques, in reference to the strips of lint that were applied to sores.|$|E

40|$|Urban {{water pricing}} {{provides}} an opportunity to examine whether consumers react {{to the shape of}} supply functions. We carry out an empirical analysis of the influence of price and price structure on residential water demand, using the most price-diverse, detailed, household-level water demand data yet available for this purpose. We adapt the Hausman model of labor supply under progressive income taxation to estimate water demand under non-linear prices. Ours is the first analysis to address both the simultaneous determination of marginal price and water demand under block pricing and the possibility of endogenous price structures in the cross section. In order to examine the possibility that consumers <b>facing</b> <b>block</b> prices are more price-responsive, all else equal, we test for price elasticity differences across price structures. We find that households <b>facing</b> <b>block</b> prices are more sensitive to price increases than households facing uniform marginal prices. Tests for endogenous price structures cannot rule out a behavioral response to the shape of supply, but suggest that observed differences in price elasticity under supply curves of varying shapes may result, in part, from underlying heterogeneity among utility service areas. ...|$|E

40|$|A Mathematical Framework for Combining Error Correction and Encryption Error {{resilience}} and energy efficiency {{are two main}} challenges <b>facing</b> <b>block</b> ciphers in noisy and resource constrained wireless environments. Traditionally, error correcting codes are used to recover from channel induced errors. However, this two step operation: encryption followed by error correction adds extra burden on an already resource constrained environment. Combining the two operations into one primitive {{has the potential to}} achieve efficient error correcting ciphers. However, if such a joint system is not designed carefully both error correcting capacity and security could be compromised. For this reason, the design of error correcting ciphers has remained an open problem for the past 25 years. In this work, we propose two error correcting block ciphers: the High Diffusion (HD) cipher and the Pyramid cipher. Both ciphers use our recently proposed HD codes in the diffusion layer. The HD cipher is a ten round cipher which uses many small HD codes, whereas the Pyramid cipher is a five round cipher which uses a singl...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the seismic {{performance}} of three geosynthetic-reinforced segmental retaining wall systems backfilled with a silty sand mixture, using a shaking table excited by 1995 Kobe earthquake loadings. The preparation of the backfill mixture and its properties, the tested wall configurations, the reinforcement layouts and instrumentations, and the observed wall performance are described. Visual observations and test results indicate that walls having 0. 4 -m vertical reinforcement spacing, backfilled with soil containing {{a large percentage of}} fines, performed better than those having good-quality sandy soil under otherwise identical conditions. Vertical spacing of 0. 8 m with removal of interlocking <b>facing</b> <b>blocks</b> in one of the walls did not lead to global collapse under repeated applications of the Kobe earthquake loadings. Only localized shear failure behind the top block layer was observed as the top <b>facing</b> <b>blocks</b> tended to topple. The good performance was attributable to apparent cohesion in the soil mixture stemming from soil matrix suction and true cohesion. Because this apparent cohesion is affected by the moisture content, its existence must be ensured by providing proper drainage to prevent seepage into the backfill. Considering the risk {{associated with the use of}} apparent cohesion, its exclusion from design is recommended. DOI: 10. 1061 /(ASCE) GT. 1943 - 5606. 0000669.

The arch has collapsed, and large masses of mortared rubble sit in the streambed. <b>Facing</b> <b>blocks</b> remain in place only on the downstream (south) side of the bridge, which is much better preserved than the upstream side. ** Construction: The bridge is constructed of mortared rubble faced with petit appareil masonry. The <b>facing</b> <b>blocks</b> include various fieldstones such as schist, 0. 20 – 0. 50 m long, 0. 15 – 0. 20 m high, and 0. 20 – 0. 50 m deep, and leveled with chinking stones. The white lime-based mortar has densely packed stone inclusions that vary greatly in size, with most less than 0. 02 m. The masonry is noticeably different from that of the other bridges, both in the regularity and level placement of the <b>facing</b> <b>blocks</b> and in the pointing of the joints. ** Description: The bridge is preserved to a height of 13 m, a width of 6. 7 m, and a length of 50 m.

Epifluorescence-based serial <b>block</b> <b>face</b> imaging presents a number of unique challenges for visualizing bone specimens due to noise generated by subsurface signal and local variations in tissue autofluorescence.
