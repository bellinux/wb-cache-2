With the help of the journalist and arts <b>exhibition</b> <b>manager</b> Andreas Grosz the Digitalismus (Digitalism) exhibition of paintings, sculptures and objects by Petrus Wandrey is staged at the State Museum of Braunschweig, accompanied by the catalogue Digitalismus.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{commitment}} within science centres and museums to deploy computer-based exhibits to enhance participation and engage visitors with socio-scientific issues. As yet however, we have little understanding of the interaction and communication that arises with and around these forms of exhibits, {{and the extent to}} which they do indeed facilitate engagement. In this paper, we examine the use of novel computer-based exhibits to explore how people, both alone and with others, interact with and around the installations. The data are drawn from video-based field studies of the conduct and communication of visitors to the Energy Gallery at London’s Science Museum. The paper explores how visitors transform their activity with and around computer-based exhibits into performances, and how such performances create shared experiences. It reveals how these performances can attract other people to become an audience to an individual’s use of the system and subsequently sustain their engagement with both the performance and the exhibit. The observations and findings of the study are used to reflect upon the extent to which the design of exhibits enables particular forms of co-participation or shared experiences, and to develop design sensitivities that <b>exhibition</b> <b>managers</b> and designers may consider when wishing to engender novel ways of engagement and participation with and around computer-based exhibits...|$|R

50|$|MVP Baseball 2005 {{includes}} an <b>exhibition</b> mode, a <b>manager's</b> mode, two different franchise modes, a scenario editor, {{and a handful}} of baseball-themed practice games. The exhibition mode lets the player quickly set up a game against another team, and both pick a starting pitcher and adjust the lineup, if needed. The manager mode is simulated based on the choices the players make before the opening pitch. The players don't actually see the players swing or make plays. Instead, the player picks from a list of managerial choices, and the outcome of each play is printed onscreen in a running box score. The scenario editor lets players adjust 20 different variables—such as the teams involved, inning, count, who's on base, and so on—the players can set up every possible scenario that has ever occurred in baseball history.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{understand}} the customer satisfaction between Mainland shoppers and Local Shoppers regarding the shopping centre in HK. It will be reviewed and analyzed based on shopping centre management theories. Apart from finding out the shopping behavior of mainland shoppers and Hong Kong shoppers, we would like {{to understand}} their customer satisfaction on different customer services aspects. Data was collected through questionnaire. Survey of two shopping centres were carried out {{to understand the}} customer satisfaction. In-depth study on the customer satisfaction between Mainlanders and Hong Kong people is then carried out. It was found that Mainland shoppers and local shoppers have different expectation in different customer services aspects. For example, Mainlander thinks that prices of the products in both shopping centre - Harbour City and Landmark North is reasonable. However, local shoppers think that the product in Landmark North is expensive. Also, the Mainland shoppers think that both the shopping centre provide a wide range of product for them. However, Hong Kong people expects the variety of product are not enough in both the shopping centre. On the other hand, they both appreciate the high customer service performance in Hong Kong. In conclusion, Hong Kong and Mainlander appreciate a wider range of shops in term of price, product category and <b>exhibition.</b> Shopping centre <b>managers</b> should provide a comfortable environment which could enhance the shopping experience of the customer. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of the paper: The {{main goal}} {{of the work is}} to outline the {{principal}} trends and the role played by the web communication within the international trade fair scenario. At a later time, the adequacy of the online communicative activities, adopted by the Italian exhibition centers, is evaluated. Methodology: A systematic review process (aimed at identify all the academic articles focused on the Trade Shows field between 1996 and 2016 and in particular on the web communication role) and a website quality evaluation model (2 QCV 2 Q, Mich, Franch, 2000) are adopted. The model is here adapted to the sector of reference by the insertion of a series of quality variables specifically identified and used in literature for the trade show websites quality evaluation. Results: The survey shows an overall insufficient and underdeveloped adoption of the online communicative tools by the National exhibition centers. Although the majority of them own an official website, only a small percentage (about less than half) realizes really interactive online communicative activities. From {{the point of view of}} the single investigated dimensions, the National trade show websites present, as a whole, a correct brand identity construction (IDENTITY), a high content richness (CONTENT) and, to a lesser extent, a proper and careful website content management/update (MANAGEMENT). In contrast, the most evident criticalities have emerged in the context of the INDIVIDUATION, USABILITY and SERVICES dimensions. Limits: The study limitation is linked to the fact the survey has been conducted from an external perspective, not making possible, in this context, to realize a trade show online communication assessment in relation to the governance specific objectives. For the future, the authors’ interest is to extend the research from a methodological (through direct interviews with the National <b>exhibition</b> centers <b>managers)</b> and a geographical point of view (through a comparison with exhibition systems of other countries, in order to understand the real development state of the National exhibition centers online communicative activities). Implications: The study identifies a series of possible learning and innovative paths the National trade show industry could undertake in order to reduce the gap that currently separates the National exhibition universe from a totally powerful use of the web communication tools. Originality of the paper: The adopted literature review process has permitted to map the different academic articles that have deepened, in the last 20 years, the Tradeshows (TSs) field, allowing, in this way, to outline the main trends characterizing the recent literature specifically dedicated to this research sector...|$|R
