5|$|Imperial Bedrooms is a {{novel by}} American author Bret Easton Ellis. Released on June 15, 2010, it is the sequel to Less Than Zero, Ellis' 1985 bestselling {{literary}} debut, which was shortly followed by a film adaptation in 1987. Imperial Bedrooms revisits Less Than Zeros self-destructive and disillusioned youths as they approach middle-age in the present <b>day.</b> <b>Like</b> Ellis' earlier novel, which took its name from Elvis Costello's 1977 song of the same name, Imperial Bedrooms is named after Costello's 1982 album.|$|E
5|$|The postwar climate sees {{a period}} of {{austerity}} and mistrust towards the machines. Returning from {{the horrors of the}} war, Marke becomes the Consul of Berlin and instates a reign of isolation and deurbanization. Advanced weapons are destroyed, people are driven out into the countryside to cultivate the land, and the giant energy accumulators are destroyed. Columns made to look like bulls are erected in city squares and at crossroads, and roar twice a <b>day</b> <b>like</b> a dying animal to remind people of the catastrophe of the Ural War. Marduk succeeds Marke as the Consul and continues the period of brutal authoritarian rule.|$|E
5|$|Weidling {{had given}} the order for the {{survivors}} to break out to the north-west; the plan got underway at around 23:00. The first group from the Reich Chancellery, led by Mohnke, tried but could not break through the Soviet rings and was captured the next <b>day.</b> <b>Like</b> others from the Führerbunker who were captured, he was interrogated by SMERSH. On the third break-out attempt from the Reich Chancellery, made around 01:00 (2 May), Bormann managed to cross the Spree. Arthur Axmann, who followed the same route, reported seeing Bormann's body {{a short distance from}} the Weidendammer bridge.|$|E

25|$|Tactics on {{the field}} changed too. Risky moves that could get players hurt, and {{sideline}} {{millions of dollars in}} payroll on the disabled list, became less common. Stealing home, a popular tactic of great stars of the <b>day</b> <b>like</b> Ty Cobb or Pete Rose, became infrequent occurrences.|$|E
25|$|Because this {{reference}} frame rotates {{several times a}} minute rather than only once a <b>day</b> <b>like</b> the Earth, the Coriolis acceleration produced is many times larger and so easier to observe on small time and spatial scales than is the Coriolis acceleration caused by {{the rotation of the}} Earth.|$|E

Her case was the only one not connected to the attacks, and, in order to generate media interest, her brother claimed to the media that he had last heard from her during the attack. She has never been found or otherwise accounted for.|$|E

25|$|The Independent or Tongnip Sinmun (독립신문; 1896–1899) was {{an early}} Korean {{newspaper}}. Tongnip Sinmun was the first privately managed modern daily newspaper in Korea. It was founded in July 1896 {{by a member of}} the enlightened Korean intelligentsia, Seo Jae-pil (later known as Philip Jaisohn). It constituted two different language editions: Korean and English. Originally, it was published every other day and developed into a daily newspaper in Korean. The English edition, originally published every other <b>day</b> <b>like</b> the Korean edition, was later only published weekly.|$|E
25|$|The anti-apartheid {{movement}} led the ICC {{to impose a}} moratorium on tours in 1970. This decision excluded players such as Graeme Pollock, Barry Richards and Mike Procter from partaking in international Test Cricket. It would also cause the emigration of future stars like, Basil D'Oliveira, Allan Lamb and Robin Smith, who both played for England, and Kepler Wessels, who initially played for Australia, before returning to South Africa. World class cricketers of their <b>day</b> <b>like</b> Clive Rice, Vintcent van der Bijl also never played Test Cricket despite their first class records.|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy {{for women}} has its hardships. Women lock {{themselves}} {{away in the}} woods inside a hut to keep pregnancy localized, only mothers and grandmothers see the women during labor {{to see how she}} is doing. Pregnant women {{have to deal with the}} pregnancy with the help of other women while the men go along their <b>day</b> <b>like</b> nothing else is happening. They are more pleased with the birth of a girl than that of a boy. The reason being is for the sake of multiplication, in other words, even though women are sent away for their pregnancy, they are given more praise for women being born.|$|E

25|$|The {{curriculum}} at Hackney was very broad, including a grounding in the Greek and Latin classics, mathematics, history, government, science, and, of course, religion. Much of his education there was along traditional lines; however, the tutelage having been {{strongly influenced by}} eminent Dissenting thinkers of the <b>day</b> <b>like</b> Richard Price and Joseph Priestley, there was also much that was nonconformist. Priestley, whom Hazlitt had read and who {{was also one of}} his teachers, was an impassioned commentator on political issues of the day. This, along with the turmoil {{in the wake of the}} French Revolution, sparked in Hazlitt and his classmates lively debates on these issues, as they saw their world being transformed around them.|$|E
25|$|ETFs {{are similar}} in many ways to {{traditional}} mutual funds, except that shares in an ETF can be bought and sold throughout the <b>day</b> <b>like</b> stocks on a stock exchange through a broker-dealer. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs do not sell or redeem their individual shares at net asset value (NAV). Instead, financial institutions purchase and redeem ETF shares directly from the ETF, but only in large blocks (such as 50,000 shares), called creation units. Purchases and redemptions of the creation units generally are in kind, with the institutional investor contributing or receiving a basket of securities of the same type and proportion held by the ETF, although some ETFs may require or permit a purchasing or redeeming shareholder to substitute cash for {{some or all of}} the securities in the basket of assets.|$|E
25|$|Billy and {{the choir}} {{finished}} up 2008 with {{tours of the}} San Francisco area, {{a stop on the}} traveling lecture series, Democracy in America, and another trip to Iceland. During {{the time of year when}} they orchestrate their part in Buy Nothing <b>Day,</b> <b>like</b> protesting at Macy's, the group was presented with the shocking news of the death of Walmart employee, Jdimytai Damour. That day the group spoke about his death and the pregnant woman who lost her child in the event at Union Square Park for their Dance Your Debt Away event. Billy released an official statement to the press. The following Sunday the group traveled to the Long Island Walmart where the worker died and held a candlelight vigil. Billy appeared on Fox News and Savitri D. later appeared on Democracy Now to discuss the event.|$|E

25|$|These {{traditional}} {{markets are}} {{a variation of}} tianguis, or open air markets, which have been {{an important part of}} commerce since pre Hispanic times. The difference is that traditional tianguis are held on specific days, with individual vendors setting up and taking down their stalls on the same <b>day.</b> <b>Like</b> tianguis, traditional fixed markets have stands occupied by various individual merchants, and tend to sell the same kinds of products: produce, groceries and other basic necessities. The difference is that the fixed markets operate every day, and individual stands are rented and occupied {{in much the same way}} as a store is. The fixed market has its origin in various attempts to replace tianguis with markets that can be better regulated. However, the tianguis were never replaced. Many tianguis, especially in rural areas, now operate in conjunction with the fixed markets to expand on variety of merchandise available.|$|E
25|$|A lengthy weather delay {{forced a}} few pairings to {{complete}} their first round on Friday morning. It was clear though on Thursday that Robert Karlsson and Jeev Milkha Singh would share the 18-hole lead after shooting matching 68s. Sergio García, still looking for his first major championship, headed up a group of five that shot one-under 69s. Phil Mickelson shot an even-par 70 to place him in an eight-way tie for eighth. Retief Goosen appeared to be piecing together a fabulous opening round when he birdied four of his first seven holes to get to -4. His fortunes would change, however, as he shot six-over {{the rest of the}} way to drop four strokes off the lead after the first <b>day.</b> <b>Like</b> Goosen, 2008 Open Champion, Pádraig Harrington, got off to a flying start by birdieing his first three holes. Unfortunately for him, he shot four-over {{the rest of the way}} to finish his round with a 71. Kenny Perry was forced to withdraw due to the effects of an eye problem that began plaguing him earlier in the week.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, {{readers of}} 18th-century {{literature}} now {{need to understand}} the history of the period more than most readers of other literature do. The authors were writing for an informed audience and only secondarily for posterity. Even the authors, who criticised writing that lived for only a <b>day</b> (<b>like</b> Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope, in The Dedication to Prince Posterity of A Tale of a Tub and Dunciad, among other pieces) were criticising specific authors, who are unknown to those without historical knowledge of the period. Poetry of all forms was in constant dialogue, and each author was responding and commenting upon the others. Novels were written against other novels (like the battles between Samuel Richardson and Henry Fielding, who, along with Eliza Haywood, wrote a novel satirising Richardson's Pamela, and between Laurence Sterne and Tobias Smollett). Plays were written to make fun of plays or to counter the success of plays (like the reaction against and for Cato and, later, Fielding's The Author's Farce). Therefore, history and literature are linked in a way rarely seen at other times. On one hand, the metropolitan and political writing can seem like coterie or salon work, but on the other hand, it was the literature of people deeply committed to sorting out a new type of government, new technologies and newly-vexatious challenges to philosophical and religious certainty.|$|E
