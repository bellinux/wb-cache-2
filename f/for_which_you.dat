Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E

25|$|Defamation means {{tarnishing}} {{the reputation}} of someone. It {{is divided into two}} parts, slander and libel. Slander is spoken defamation and libel is defaming somebody through print (or broadcasting). Both share the same features. To defame someone, you must (a) make a factual assertion (b) <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> cannot provide evidence of its truth. Defamation does not affect the voicing of opinions, but comes into the same fields as rights to free speech in the European Convention's Article 10.|$|E

500|$|On May 14, 1995, a {{referendum}} {{was conducted in}} all regions of Belarus. Out of four questions, one was the following: [...] "Do you support {{the introduction of the}} new national symbols?" [...] With a voter turnout of 64.7%, the new state symbols were approved by a ratio of 3:1 (75.1% to 24.9%). The way the referendum was carried out was heavily criticized by the opposition, including the exact wording of the question about the national insignia. Supporters of the Pahonia also criticize that the Pahonia and the former white-red-white flag were compared to ones, used by collaboration forces, in propaganda that was published during the run-up to the vote. The comparison was made due to the white, red, white flag and Pahonia being used on the patches and symbols of the Belarusian Central Rada, the Belarusian government under the control of Nazi Germany. Alexander Lukashenko claimed the selection of the Soviet-inspired symbols as a victory, especially to his Great Patriotic War veteran base, by saying [...] "we have returned to you the flag of the country <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> fought. We have returned to you both memory and a sense of human pride." ...|$|E

2500|$|After his rescue, Jonah obeys {{the call}} to prophesy against Nineveh, causing {{the people of the}} city to repent and God to forgive them. Jonah is furious, however, and angrily tells God that this is the reason he tried to flee from Him, as he knew Him to be a just and merciful God. He then beseeches God to kill him, a request which is denied when God causes a tree to grow over him, giving him shade. Initially grateful, Jonah's anger returns the next day, when God sends a worm to eat the plant, {{withering}} it, and he tells God {{that it would be better}} if he were dead. God then points out: [...] "You are concerned about the bush, <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> did not labour and which you did not grow; it came into being in a night and perished in a night.
