By capturing the dependencies that exist within a business context, low-level analysis can be performed on business and business process models.

As a research and test domain, the book-selling domain has been considered, and specifically, focus was given on the business models and process models of four different types of book-sellers.

In {{this paper}} we extend a {{previously}} proposed randomized landscape generator {{in combination with}} a comparative experimental methodology to study the behaviour of continuous metaheuristic optimization algorithms. In particular, we generate landscapes with parameterised, linear ridge structure and perform pairwise comparisons of algorithms to gain insight into what kind of problems are easy and difficult for one algorithm instance relative to another. We apply this methodology to investigate the specific issue of explicit <b>dependency</b> <b>modelling</b> in simple continuous Estimation of Distribution Algorithms. Experimental results reveal specific examples of landscapes (with certain identifiable features) where <b>dependency</b> <b>modelling</b> is useful, harmful or has little impact on average algorithm performance. The results are related to some previous intuition about the behaviour of these algorithms, {{but at the same}} time lead to new insights into the relationship between <b>dependency</b> <b>modelling</b> in EDAs and the structure of the problem landscape. The overall methodology is quite general and could be used to examine specific features of other algorithms. ...|$|R
50|$|The second {{theoretical}} {{contribution of}} Shaping the Political Arena concerns Latin American politics. In this regard, Shaping the Political Arena showed how {{the way in}} which labor was incorporated into national political institutions had a major and enduring effect on the subsequent evolution of a country’s party system and political regimes. Counterintuitively, where the role of labor was greater and where it participated more, the resulting political regime was more stable. This argument was examined through an ambitious comparative historical analysis of eight countries over a period of five decades that relied on four paired comparisons. One of the most controversial pairings was Brazil and Chile; this pairing was questioned by many Latin Americanists and experts on labor in Latin America. In retrospect, however, this choice has been vindicated. Nowadays it has become commonplace to see Brazil and Chile as exemplifying a common trajectory with regard to political and economic development. In brief, Shaping the Political Arena makes a major theoretical contribution through its elaboration of a critical juncture and path <b>dependency</b> <b>model</b> and also stands as the most ambitious and systematic work on Latin America in the tradition of comparative-historical analysis.|$|E
