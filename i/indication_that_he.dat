5|$|On January 21, 2016, Collins {{signed a}} {{contract}} {{to play with the}} Chicago Blues of the Midwest Professional Basketball Association. In March, he signed with the Windsor Express of the National Basketball League of Canada with no <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ever played for the Blues.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it appears}} that the Council of Chelsea {{approved}} Lichfield's elevation to an archdiocese, Hygeberht, who was present, remained a bishop at its conclusion; he signed the council's report still as a bishop. There is no <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> played any significant part in the council nor in the actions that led to him becoming an archbishop.|$|E
5|$|Regenbald first {{appears in}} the {{historical}} record in 1050, when he witnesses a charter of King Edward. King Edward gave him large estates {{as a reward for}} his service to the king as a royal chaplain. The Domesday Book records him owning at least seven churches, but only two of them have any <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> performed any ecclesiastical services personally. Another royal reward was the grant to Regenbald of the status, without the actual office, of a bishop. He probably was unable to be promoted to a bishopric, either because he was married or because his style of life was known to be unchaste.|$|E
50|$|There are <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was conflated {{with his}} grandfather.|$|R
50|$|There are <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was conflated {{with his}} grandson, Aristippus the Younger.|$|R
50|$|There are <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{also has}} latent telepathic {{abilities}} {{but these are}} undeveloped, and he only uses them on a limited basis.|$|R
5|$|The Zurich council {{decided that}} no {{compromise}} was possible. On 7 March 1526 it released the notorious mandate {{that no one}} shall rebaptise another under the penalty of death. Although Zwingli, technically, {{had nothing to do}} with the mandate, there is no <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> disapproved. Felix Manz, who had sworn to leave Zurich and not to baptise any more, had deliberately returned and continued the practice. After he was arrested and tried, he was executed on 5 January 1527 by being drowned in the Limmat. He was the first Anabaptist martyr; three more were to follow, after which all others either fled or were expelled from Zurich.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} D-League, Clinkscales signed in 2013 with the Panama City Breeze of the semi-professional American Basketball League (ABL), with no <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> joined {{any other team}} since his tenure with the BayHawks. On February 16, 2013, he scored 12 points with two three-pointers in a loss to the Emerald Coast Knights. While with the Breeze, Clinkscales (and his teammates) endured {{financial}} and domestic difficulties. He lived with five other teammates in a duplex house in Bay County, Florida. Because of financial issues, the league failed to pay the players—with Clinkscales solely receiving a check of $400—and canceled several games on its schedule. Later in the season, the players' duplex was supposedly leased by Breeze's head coach, Ty Fisher. A local broker filed a civil lawsuit against Fisher to evict the players, and county sheriff deputies soon forced them to leave the house. While living in the area, the players received aid from a local resident, Vonda Gainer, who they met at a Dollar Tree store. Gainer gave them food and washed their clothes. Despite their poor living conditions, the players failed to receive any aid by the league, with no contact or assurance from league CEO Steve Haney.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} {{revealed that}} the first officer was seated in the left seat of the flight deck, which the investigators saw as an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was receiving flight instruction from the captain during the accident flight.|$|E
50|$|After {{this and}} other <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had misgauged his social status, he commits suicide by carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning, running his car in a closed garage.|$|R
50|$|Schwinn Bicycle Company: June 1977-November 1980 He left Schwinn when <b>he</b> got <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and {{his brother}} Robby Rupe {{were about to be}} dropped by them.|$|R
50|$|For example: A mother {{yells at}} her child for {{throwing}} sand outside the sandbox. The child {{continues to play}} in the sandbox without showing any <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has been screamed at.|$|R
25|$|Five {{days after}} {{finishing}} the composition, he {{wrote on the}} title page of the manuscript a tribute to Vladimir Stasov, to whom the work is dedicated. One month later, he added an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> intended to have it published.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no record}} of Welman being paid to work, an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was likely quite wealthy. He married May, 11 years his junior, {{sometime}} between the 1881 and 1901 censuses. He died in South Ascot, Berkshire, on 30 December 1931, aged 82.|$|E
25|$|Malise (Gaelic: Maol Íosa; fl. 1138), is the {{earliest}} known earl or mormaer of Strathearn in central Scotland. There is no <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the first earl of Strathearn, but as nothing is known of his predecessors, he is generally referred to as such.|$|E
50|$|Casimir I died in 1358 (although {{there are}} some <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> lived until 1360, but this is refuted by the {{majority}} of historians) and was buried in the Dominican church of Cieszyn.|$|R
5|$|There {{are some}} <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> met with many saints and fakirs, {{and worked as}} a weaver. He claimed to have been with the army of Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{believed}} he had a career in Antwerp where the last record about Galle dates to 1679. [...] There are further <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> worked in Brussels where he joined the local Guild of Saint Luke.|$|R
25|$|Civilian {{rule was}} re-established {{in the country}} in 1985, and the {{administration}} of President José Sarney publicly revealed two years later that Brazil had achieved uranium enrichment capacity through a secret nuclear program. While Sarney made this announcement, there is no <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> tried {{to put an end to}} the nuclear military activities.|$|E
25|$|Gough – whom Haig {{had been}} subject to {{a great deal of}} {{political}} pressure to sack - dined with Haig on evening of 15 March. There is no <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was crying out for reinforcements. Gough later wrote in his memoirs that Haig had explained to him that he was concentrating on holding the Channel Ports.|$|E
25|$|In early 1971, Hackworth was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} colonel, and received orders to attend the Army War College, an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was being groomed for the general officer ranks. He had declined a previous opportunity to go to the War College, and turned down this one as well, indicating his lack of interest in becoming a general and demonstrating his discontent with the war and the Army's leaders.|$|E
5000|$|Third, Freud {{referred}} to <b>indications</b> <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> argued, the unconscious {{is unable to}} distinguish fact from fiction. In the unconscious {{there is no sign}} of reality, so one cannot differentiate between the truth and the fiction invested with feeling.|$|R
25|$|For {{several days}} after his DWI arrest and his {{admission}} of an adulterous affair and fathering an out-of-wedlock child, Fossella gave <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might run for re-election despite these problems. On May 20, however, {{he dropped out of}} the race.|$|R
50|$|Following the Battle of Sekigahara, Hisanobu {{was summoned}} to an {{audience}} with Tokugawa Ieyasu in Kyoto and died shortly afterwards. There are <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was ordered to commit seppuku. He was followed in succession by his son Matsura Takanobu.|$|R
25|$|In 1981, Garroway {{underwent}} open-heart surgery, {{a result}} of which he contracted a staph infection. On January 14, 1982, Today broadcast its 30th anniversary special, which featured all of the important living former and current staff members. Garroway, who had recently undergone rehab for an amphetamine addiction, appeared to be cheerful and in good spirits during the show. He also gave every <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be present for the show's 35th anniversary in 1987.|$|E
25|$|The Attorney-General {{told the}} {{opposition}} {{that despite the}} Health Minister's resignation, the {{motion of no confidence}} could still go ahead. The Speaker's response prompted the opposition to seek assistance from the Governor-General for a second time so that parliament could be reconvened once again. The opposition claimed that the prime minister had given no <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would call a by-election for Nui, which, in Tuvalu, the PM must do to allow an election to occur.|$|E
25|$|After Zhang {{departed}} Xinjiang, he {{was named}} the deputy leader of the Leading Group for Party Building, a group headed by Liu Yunshan. Political analysts noted that his involvement in party cohesion and organization was a promotion, possibly even an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be groomed {{to take on a}} more substantial party affairs role following the 19th Party Congress. His first public appearance as part of the Party Building group was a visit to the Communist revolutionary heartland of Yan'an. However, other observers have interpreted the move more pessimistically, noting that it in fact mirrors Wang Lequan's own departure from Xinjiang six years earlier when he was given a seemingly token role as a deputy to then security-tsar Zhou Yongkang. Zhang is a potential candidate for ascension to the Politburo Standing Committee at the Congress in 2017.|$|E
25|$|While Collor {{was open}} to {{international}} cooperation and favored Brazilian integration in several multilateral institutions, there were no <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> intended to sign the NPT. Indeed, Brazil would only accede to the non-proliferation regime in 1998, six years after Collor left office.|$|R
50|$|Anthony Eden, the Prime Minister at the time, made no {{reference}} to the Ruth Ellis case in his memoirs, nor {{is there anything in}} his papers. <b>He</b> accepted <b>that</b> the decision was the responsibility of the Home Secretary, but there are <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was troubled by it.|$|R
50|$|On 11 January 2010 {{he signed}} for Brisbane Roar in the Australian A-League for the {{remainder}} of the season, replacing former captain Craig Moore. It was announced on 6 May <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not been offered a new contract for the next season despite earlier <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be retained by the club.|$|R
25|$|After {{the signing}} of the Oslo Peace Accords in 1993, Habash and the PFLP again broke {{completely}} with Arafat, accusing him of selling out the Palestinian revolution. The group set up an anti-Arafat and anti-Oslo alliance in Damascus, for the first time joined by non-PLO Islamist groups such as Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which had grown to prominence during the First Intifada. After finding the position sterile, with Palestinian political dynamics playing out on the West Bank and Gaza areas of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Habash carefully sought to repair ties to Arafat, and gain a hold in post-Oslo politics without compromising PFLP principles. However, there is no <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ever accepted the two-state solution. This balancing act could not save the PFLP from being eclipsed by the militant Islamist factions on the one hand, and the resource-rich Fatah with its PNA patronage network on the other. The significance of the PFLP in Palestinian politics has diminished considerably since the mid-90s. The PFLP participated in the Palestinian legislative elections of 2006 as Abu Ali Mustafa won 4.2% of the popular vote.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} speculation {{as to the}} actual paternity of Paul I. It is suggested {{that he was not}} Peter's son at all, but that his mother had engaged in an affair—to which Elizabeth had consented—with a young officer named Sergei Vasilievich Saltykov, and that he was Paul's real father. In any case Peter never gave any <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believed Paul to have been fathered by anyone but himself. He also did not take any interest in parenthood. Elizabeth though most certainly took an active interest. She removed the young Paul and acted as if she were his mother and not Catherine. The Empress had ordered the midwife to take the baby and to follow her. Catherine was not to see her child for another month and then on the second time briefly for the churching ceremony. Six months later Elizabeth let Catherine see the child again. The child had in effect become a ward of the state and in a larger sense, the property of the state, to be brought up by Elizabeth as she believed he should be — as a true heir and great-grandson of her father, Peter the Great.|$|E
500|$|Watson {{continued}} his analysis, writing {{that despite the}} crows' attempts to erode Scarecrow's confidence, [...] " [...] gives no <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> intends to abort his efforts to liberate himself physically and intellectually." [...] Watson concluded his study of Scarecrow and his scene by stating, [...] "His encounter with Dorothy will help him to realize, contrary to The Crow's assertions, that Scarecrow's pursuit of knowledge can indeed help him to win opportunities for improving his life." ...|$|E
50|$|Iran's {{reaction}} to India's 1974 surprise nuclear test detonation (codenamed Smiling Buddha) was muted. During a state visit to Iran in 1977, Bhutto {{tried to persuade}} Pahlavi to support Pakistan's own clandestine atomic bomb project. Although the Shah's response is not known, there are <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> refused to oblige Bhutto.|$|R
5000|$|Gillian B. Loeb {{appears in}} Batman Begins portrayed by Colin McFarlane. Unlike in the comics, Loeb is African-American. He first appears when informing young Bruce Wayne {{that they have}} caught Joe Chill for murdering Bruce's parents. Loeb is portrayed more sympathetically in the films, with no <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is corrupt.|$|R
