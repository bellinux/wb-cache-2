5|$|There are {{fourteen}} extant {{families of}} the order Testudines, an order of reptile commonly known as turtles, tortoises and terrapins. The testudines {{are some of the}} most ancient reptiles alive, with only the tuataras considered more primitive. There are approximately 300 extant species and 97 genera of testudines, split into two suborders: the Cryptodirans and the Pleurodirans. The distinction between these two suborders is based on the mode in which they cover their head and neck. The Pleurodirans, also called the side-necked turtles, have long necks, and fold them sideways to align them with the shell. The Pelomedusidae and Chelidae are the only extant families of pleurodires. The Cryptodirans pull their neck straight back to conceal their head within the shell. The Carettochelyidae, Cheloniidae, Chelydridae, Dermatemydidae, <b>Dermochelyidae,</b> Emydidae, Kinosternidae, Testudinidae and Trionychidae are all cryptodires, although the ability to retract the head has been lost in the sea turtles (Cheloniidae and <b>Dermochelyidae).</b> A third order, the Paracryptodirans, are extinct.|$|E

Although sea turtles usually lay around one hundred eggs at a time, on average only one of the eggs from the nest will survive to adulthood. [...] While {{many of the things that}} endanger these {{hatchlings}} are natural, such as predators including sharks, raccoons, foxes, and seagulls, many new threats to the sea turtle species have recently arrived and increased with the ever-growing presence of humans.|$|E

The removal of outgroup taxa, except the hypothetical taxon, resolved some relations and found Ocepechelon and Bouliachelys to be basal dermochelyoids in a polytomy with the <b>Dermochelyidae</b> and the Protostegidae. The inclusion of Chelomacryptodira resolved this polytomy, and found Ocepechelon to be the most basal dermochelyid.|$|E

50|$|Taxonomically, Santanachelys {{has been}} placed in the family Protostegidae {{along with many other}} extinct sea turtles. It is the {{earliest}} member of the family to date, and the earliest known member of the sea turtle superfamily, Chelonioidea. Cladistically, it is the sister taxon {{to the rest of the}} later protostegids, including Protostega and Notochelone. As a member of its family, its closest living relative belongs to the family <b>Dermochelyidae,</b> the leatherback turtle.|$|E
50|$|Mesodermochelys is an extinct genus of {{sea turtle}} {{known from the}} Santonian to the Campanian (Late Cretaceous) of what today is Japan. One species is known, the type species M. undulatus; it was given its {{binomial}} name by Ren Hirayama and Tsutomu Chitoku in 1996. Studies of its skull indicate {{that it was a}} primitive member of the <b>Dermochelyidae</b> (leatherback turtle family) that was closely related to the Protostegidae. It has been described as the best representative of Mesozoic dermochelyids.|$|E
50|$|Domenico Agostino Vandelli {{named the}} species first in 1761 as Testudo coriacea after an animal {{captured}} at Ostia and {{donated to the}} University of Padua by Pope Clement XIII. In 1816, French zoologist Henri Blainville coined the term Dermochelys. The leatherback was then reclassified as Dermochelys coriacea. In 1843, the zoologist Leopold Fitzinger put the genus in its own family, <b>Dermochelyidae.</b> In 1884, the American naturalist Samuel Garman described the species as Sphargis coriacea schlegelii. The two were then united in D. coriacea, with each given subspecies status as D. c. coriacea and D. c. schlegelii. The subspecies were later labeled invalid synonyms of D. coriacea.|$|E
50|$|As some of {{the first}} marine turtles, the protostegids set the general body plan for future species of sea turtles. They had a {{generally}} depressed turtle body plan, complete with four limbs, a short tail, and a large head {{at the end of a}} relatively short neck. Like other sea turtles, they possessed oar-like front appendages especially evolved for swimming in the open ocean. Similar to the still-extant, possibly closely related <b>Dermochelyidae,</b> protostegids possessed extremely reduced carapaces. Some specimens had skeletal protrusions from their ribs almost wrapping around their bodies in place of a complete shell. Like modern sea turtles, protostegids had sharp beaks. One of the defining characteristics of the members of the family was their almost-disproportionately large heads. Specifically, some specimens of Archelon have been found with heads 1 m long. In addition, the members of the family had somewhat reduced plastrons, as well.|$|E
5000|$|The exact phylogenetic {{position}} of protostegids among turtles is uncertain. Some phylogenetic studies determine the leatherback turtles {{in the family}} <b>Dermochelyidae</b> to be their closest living relatives, with both these families being monophyletic. Conversely, the phylogenetic analyses conducted by Joyce (2007) and Anquetin (2012), which included one protostegid species (Santanachelys gaffneyi), recovered the family as only distantly related to leatherback turtles. Joyce (2007) recovered Protostegidae as basal eucryptodiran turtles lying outside the crown group of Cryptodira (the least inclusive clade containing all living cryptodirans) and closely related to Solnhofia parsonsi; Santanachelys had a similar phylogenetic position in the analysis conducted by Anquetin (2012), who stressed that future studies should include more protostegids to confirm this phylogenetic placement. If confirmed, these results would prove that protostegids weren't close relatives of leatherback turtles (or in fact any living cryptodirans), but instead [...] "represent an independent lineage of marine turtles that originated in the Late Jurassic". The analyses conducted by Sterli (2010) and Sterli & de la Fuente (2011) recovered Santanachelys (and, presumably, the entirety of Protostegidae) as even more distantly related to living cryptodirans; it {{was found to be}} basal turtle lying outside the crown group of turtles (the least inclusive clade containing cryptodirans and pleurodirans).|$|E

40|$|Many of {{the early}} taxonomic studies of fossil sea turtles relied heavily on postcranial evidence. Both the Cheloniidae and <b>Dermochelyidae</b> were erected on detail of the shell and limbs. ‘Desmatochelys’ was {{originally}} described in part using cranial evidence, but later workers (Zangerl and Sloan, 1960) suppressed the family on evidence from the shell. Little {{in the way of}} comparative work has been undertaken using the cranial morphology of fossil or living forms. This is thought long overdue. The first bone by bone description of the living cheloniids has revealed a large number of taxonomically useful characters and a close relationship between the genera. However, a great deal of interspecific variation was noted. ‘Chelonia mydas’ is considered to format least three subspecies on cranial evidence. The newly described ‘Natator (Chelonia) depressa’ is thought distinct from other living forms. The <b>Dermochelyidae</b> are seen to be a very conservative group and a large number of cranial characters link fossil and living forms. The arterial circulation of Dermochelys is redescribed and the importance of the blood flow to the head for use by the salt secreting glands in electrolyte balance is shown to be important. The Desmatochelyidae is shown to be a family in its own right, {{and a number of other}} genera, notably ‘Rhinochelys’ and ‘Notochelone’, are thought members of the group.

40|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{can be used}} to determine whether heritable behaviors are ancestral for a group. I mapped onto a cladogram 27 of these social behaviors from eight families: Trionychidae, Chelydridae, <b>Dermochelyidae,</b> Cheloniidae, Kinostemidae, Testudinidae, Platysternidae, and Emydidae. The social behaviors were sniffing, vocalization, circling, approach (chase), trailing, face-to-face, right-angle head, female positioned above male, male in forelimb reaction, shell drop, shell lift, biting, ramming (bumping), rubbing, pushing, neck extension, head bobs (swaying), titillation sequence, vibratory phase, tapping, shell scratch, tilting, lateral waggle, tail hook, tail drop (tail down), gulping, and snout-to-snout contact. The results indicate that the families have at least one behavior that is ancestral to each and convergent evolution occurs in some of the families. Several families and species were not included within this study because the behaviors were not recorded or there were not enough studies to support the information given for them. ...|$|E

40|$|Objective The Leatherback {{sea turtle}} {{is the largest}} extant reptile and the sole {{member of the family}} <b>Dermochelyidae.</b> Here, the eye of this {{critically}} endangered marine turtle was investigated to determine the anatomy, optics, and optical sensitivity. Animals studied Three Leatherback sea turtles, Dermochelys coriacea. Results The eye is small in proportion to body size of the adult compared to other vertebrates, with prominence of the retractor bulbi and pyramidalis muscles. The nictitans shows extensive folding of the bulbar conjunctiva as an apparent mechanism to increase the surface area for mucus secretion. The intraocular anatomy is consistent with an eye adapted to aquatic vision with minimal curvature of the cornea, a near-spherical lens, deep ciliary cleft and highly vascularized ciliary body. The optical sensitivity, a measure of the sensitivity to light of a given optical system, is higher than in other marine turtles studied but lower than those found in teleost fish that share a habitat with the Leatherback sea turtle.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} shape patterns of the shoulder girdle in relation to different functional and environmental behaviours in turtles. The Procrustes method was used to compare the shoulder girdles (scapula and coracoid) of 88 adult extant turtles. The results indicate that four shape patterns can be distinguished. The shoulder girdles of (1) terrestrial (Testudinidae), (2) highly aquatic freshwater (Trionychidae, Carettochelyidae) and (3) marine turtles (Cheloniidae, <b>Dermochelyidae)</b> correspond to three specialized morphological patterns, whereas the shoulder girdle of (4) semi-aquatic freshwater turtles (Bataguridae, Chelidae, Chelydridae, Emydidae, Kinosternidae, Pelomedusidae, Platysternidae, Podocnemididae) is more generalized. In terrestrial turtles, the long scapular prong and the short coracoid are associated with a domed shell and a mode of locomotion in which walking is predominant. By contrast, highly aquatic freshwater turtles share traits with marine turtles. In both, the short scapular prong and the long coracoid are associated with a flat shell, and swimming locomotion. The enlarged attachment sites of the biceps, coracobrachialis magnus, and supracoracoideus also give these strong swimmers a mechanical advantage during adduction and retraction of the arm. Increasing size leads to allometrical shape changes that emphasize mechanical efficiency both in terrestrial and in aquatic turtles...|$|E
40|$|False eggs (SAGs) {{facilitate}} social post-hatching emergence behaviour in Leatherback turtles Dermochelys coriacea (Testudines: <b>Dermochelyidae)</b> nests. Hatchling emergence to {{the beach}} surface from deep sand nests occurs without parental care. Social behaviour among siblings is crucial to overcome this first challenge in sea turtles life. This study, carried out at the Caribbean coast of Colombia, describes the emergence social behaviour of hatchlings from eight nests, and assess the nests translocation effects on temporal patterns of emergence. For the first time, we propose that space released by dehydration of shelled albumen globes (SAGs) {{at the top of}} the clutch, might be a reproductive advantage, while facilitating neonates to group together in a very limited space, and favouring the synchrony of emergence. The mean time of groups emergence was of 3. 3 days, varying between 1 and 6 days. We found that relocation of the nests did not significantly affect the temporal pattern of emergence, which was mainly nocturnal (77. 7 % of natural nests and 81. 7 % of translocated ones). The maximum number of emergences to the surface occurred at the lowest air temperatures (22 : 00 h- 06 : 00 h). The selective advantage of this pattern is probably related to the greater rate of predation and mortality by hyper- thermia observed during the dayPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Of {{the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s 12 living turtle {{families}} with approximately 250 species, only two families, comprising eight species, are marine. All eight species are endangered or threatened. Seven species {{are in the}} family Chelonidae, the hard-shelled turtles. The leatherback is in the family <b>Dermochelyidae.</b> Five species of sea turtles inhabit the nearshore of the Southeastern United States and the Gulf of Mexico: Kemp 2 ̆ 7 s ridley (Lepidochelys kempi), loggerhead (Caretta caretta), green turtle (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea). They have several common characteristics, including relatively nonretractile extremities, extensively roofed skulls, and limbs converted to paddle-like flappers {{with one or two}} claws. They are listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Public Law 93 - 205) because their populations had declined {{largely as a result of}} human activity. Today, sea turtles continue to be killed all over the Caribbean for both local consumption and international trade. Kemp 2 ̆ 7 s ridely is now most endangered sea turtle, decimated by egg harvesting, especially for the aphrodisiac market in Mexico City, and by accidental drowning in commercial fishing nets (Anne and Rudloe, 1994). The shell from the hawksbill is the principal product traded internationally with almost all of the shells sent from the Caribbean to Japan. In some islands, the shells are also worked locally to make jewelry for the tourist trade. In 1987, an optimistic estimate of the number of hawksbills nesting in the Caribbean was 4, 975. In contrast in 1988 alone, Japan imported the shells of almost 12, 000 adult hawksbills from the Caribbean (Cruising World, 1990). This paper reviews the legal aspects, especially the Endangered Species Act, and sea turtle management, including turtle excluder devices, head start, land acquisition program, and nest relocation.
