The thesis details the findings and discusses the current issues that a typical secondary steel industry, namely WSL, is facing along with some theoretical suggestions. DRI + Scrap is the raw material in the secondary steel production in WSL. A conclusive study is conducted to check the tap times, just by melting DRI without the steel scrap. The results indicate a success and so a new method, posing a new set of problems though, to be experimented and researched on. Finally, sets of loopholes, <b>neglected</b> <b>zones</b> and bottlenecks have been identified all through the process of steel making and casting.

40|$|Worldwide, dense urban spaces {{have been}} {{organized}} and transformed by cultural values. However, in many cases, changes in {{economic and social}} conditions have resulted in fragmentation of neighborhood typologies, {{in terms of their}} physical characteristics and uses. Such spaces are a manifestation of development, expansion, dislocation and marginalization; a condition that can be improved through an architectural and urban strategy which inscribes emerging forces into the <b>neglected</b> <b>zones</b> of marginal territories. The contemporary context calls for a re-evaluation of public space. To fully engage the people, it is a necessary function of public space to blur landscape, architecture and infrastructure, as these three elements are rarely used in isolation. Public space can no longer be conceived as layers of these components of the built environment superimposed, but rather as an integrated network. As an investigation of the environmental potential of existing urban areas, this thesis attempts to use an integrated network approach to create a local, social and cultural identity in a Detroit neighborhood. By focusing on the important role the public realm plays within the urban landscape, the project creates a dialogue between the natural and built components of the urban realm by taking advantage of the potential of existing infrastructure, social factors and context. The main focus of this thesis creates a design strategy that gives character and identity to an area of the city that has been fragmented as a result of recent changes in economic and social factors. The project achieves this by weaving nature into the urban fabric. The research in this thesis culminates in a project which identifies a marginal area in Detroit and suggests alternative uses for the surrounding spaces, giving emphasis to the natural component of the urban landscape as a tool to critique the re-appropriation of spaces that outlived their original vitality. The concepts and findings from this thesis could be applied in any city towards the ecological reconditioning of marginal areas...|$|R

It finds increasing application in the study of <b>environmentally</b> modulated <b>neglected</b> tropical diseases (NTDs). Obtaining and assuring the quality of the relevant spatially and temporally indexed EO data remain challenges. Our objective was to review the Earth observation products currently used in studies of NTD epidemiology and to discuss fundamental issues relating to spatial data quality (SDQ), which limit the utilization of EO and pose challenges for its more effective use. We searched Web of Science and PubMed for studies related to EO and echinococossis, leptospirosis, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminth infections. Relevant literature was also identified from the bibliographies of those papers. We found that extensive use is made of EO products in the study of NTD epidemiology; however, the quality of these products is usually given little explicit attention. We review key issues in SDQ concerning spatial and temporal scale, uncertainty, and the documentation and use of quality information. We give examples of how these issues may interact with uncertainty in NTD data to affect the output of an epidemiological analysis. We conclude that researchers should give careful attention to SDQ when designing NTD spatial-epidemiological studies. This should be used to inform uncertainty analysis in the epidemiological study. SDQ should be documented and made available to other researchers...|$|R

Analysis of the stratified flood distributions revealed that the IPO modulated the flood risk in New South Wales and southern Queensland, with flood quantiles being increased by a factor of approximately 1. 7 during IPO negative periods, whereas little effect was detected for sites in north-east Queensland located approximately north of the Tropic of Capricorn.

Disenfranchised neighborhoods are slated for demolition, relocation, and eventual replacement. According to one view, disinvestment in urban and suburban communities tends to fall strongly along racial and class lines, and intensifies and perpetuates the cycle of poverty exerted upon the space, since more affluent individuals with social mobility can leave the disenfranchised areas. According to one view, municipal disinvestment is a direct consequence of local, state, and federal urban planning and urban renewal projects.|$|R

40|$|Most {{existing}} {{models for}} the problem of fibre/matrix stress-transfer through a partially debonded interface roughly solve the stress distribution in the debonded <b>zone,</b> <b>neglecting</b> {{the presence of the}} perfectly bonded zone. However the stress interactions between two zones is what makes the problem essentially different from the stress-transfer problem for a perfectly bonded interface. This paper suggests a variational approach based on the principle of minimum complementary energy not only in a perfectly bonded zone but also in a zone with a discontinuous interface. The debonded interface is treated as an external boundary on which a presumed interfacial shear stress is specified. A new analytical model, including stress non-uniformity in the radial direction and crack interaction, is derived to describe the stress state around fibre breaks and debonding tips in a single fibre embedded in an infinite matrix. For the presumed shear stress at the debonded interface the minimisation procedure renders the most accurate closed-form solution (under used assumptions) for both interactive zones. Finally, the 'best' shear stress distribution at the debonded interface is found by using Coulomb's friction law and simple numerical iterations. The stress profiles along both axial and radial directions are presented and compared with results from a numerical model(1) available in the literature and also from finite-element analysis. Good agreements are achieved. Extensive applications of this approach and the derived model are also discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

However, the hyproheic oligochaete assemblages have received less attention than other assemblages such as crustaceans. In addition, studies investigating the incidence of pollution in watercourses have mostly focused on the benthic <b>zone</b> and have <b>neglected</b> the hyporheic <b>zone.</b> Some examples are given from an unpolluted glacial river (Roseg), polluted plains rivers (Moselle, Rhône) and a protected wetland in an urbanized environment. The hyporheic zone kept the memory of past and present incidences of pollution, in particular when downwellings of polluted surface waters to the hyporheic zone predominated. The Active hydrologic Exchange Describers between surface and subsurface (AED oligochaete species) were the same in the glacial river Roseg, the rivers Rhône and Moselle and the urbanized wetland. The predominance of pollution-tolerant species like Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri was observed in polluted groundwater as well as in polluted surface coarse sediments. Moreover, the urbanized wetland exhibited a high species richness, suggesting that the hyporheic zone is a reservoir of species. The oligochaete communities enable biologists to simultaneously assess the pollution incidence, the permeability of coarse habitats, the water exchanges between surface and subsurface, and give an approximate measure of the metabolic activities in the sediments. Consequently, the simultaneous study of surface and hyporheic oligochaete assemblages is of great interest when considering the ecological functioning of watercourses and the incidence of pollution inputs...|$|R
5000|$|Structural {{violence}} {{affects the}} availability {{of health care in}} the sense that physicians often need to pay attention to broad social forces (racism, gender inequality, classism, etc.) to determine who falls ill and who will be given access to care. It is more likely for structural violence to occur in areas where biosocial methods are neglected in a country's health care system. Since structurally violent situations are viewed primarily as biological consequences, it <b>neglects</b> <b>environmentally</b> stimulated problems, such as negative social behaviours or inequality prominence. If biosocial understandings are forsaken when considering communicable diseases such as HIV, for example, prevention methods and treatment practices become inadequate and unsustainable for populations. However, the challenge is obvious: many countries cannot afford to stop the harmful cycle of structural violence. Paul Farmer argues that the major flaw in the dominant model of medical care is that medical services are sold as a commodity, remaining only available to those who can afford them. The concept of structural violence is used to show how medical professionals are not trained to understand the social forces behind disease, nor are they trained to deal with or alter them. Medical professionals have to ignore the social determinants that alter access to care, and as a result, medical interventions are significantly less effective in low-income countries. Structural violence is an issue not only in developing countries, but also in North America. For example, it has {{had a significant impact on}} diagnosis and treatment of AIDS in the United States. A 1990 study by Moore et al. found that blacks had a significantly lesser chance of receiving treatment than whites. [...] Findings from another study suggest that the increased rate of workplace injury among undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States can be understood as an example of structural violence. [...] Structural violence is the result of policy and social structures, and change can only be a product of altering the processes that encourage structural violence in the first place. Paul Farmer claims that [...] "structural interventions" [...] are one possible solution.|$|R

Environmental education has provided children with knowledge and skills to take action {{on behalf of the}} environment, while also raising awareness of the plight of the environment in their family homes. However, rarely have children been deliberately positioned to be intergenerational environmental change agents in their family homes. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} provide a group of children with a tool that could support them to encourage environmental change in their family homes. Critical theory underpinned the makeup and methodology of this research project with particular focus on the concepts of critical pedagogy, transformation, power and hegemony. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to test the effectiveness of a shared Protocol (Contract) for enabling children to become intergenerational environmental change agents by fostering environmentally responsible behaviour in their family homes. There were 24 participants, including six 14 -year-old children, and their family members. A Protocol was designed by the children in a school-based environmental education subject and taken home to their family members so that they could set goals for living in a more environmentally responsible manner. Data was collected using four semi-structured interview phases and researcher field notes. The data was synthesised, summarised and thematically analysed according to the supporting research questions. Data is discussed through a critical theory lens in response to the central research question. Analysis of the data revealed that the while the Protocol was reasonably effective in enabling the children to be intergenerational environmental change agents, the children had mixed success in negotiating hegemonic familial and social forces such as the dominance of adults in the family domain, the feeling of powerlessness by participants in the face of global environmental problems and the propensity of participants to <b>neglect</b> <b>environmentally</b> responsible behaviour if it threatened their established lifestyles.

The error associated with the <b>neglect</b> of this <b>zone</b> is not necessarily negligible under conditions of surface reaction or product layer diffusion control. In the reaction-diffusion regime the various models differ primarily in terms of the assumed structural representation of the solid. These structural models may involve overlapping or non-overlapping populations of grains or pores of arbitrary size distribution. These models are unified by considering the motion of pore and reaction surfaces of arbitrary shape and curvature distribution. The recent percolation models emphasizing connectivity features of the structure are also accommodated in the formulation. Among the structural models the random pore models appear the most versatile because of their applicability to systems both with or without a solid product, as well as their ability to predict evolution of the pore size distribution. Percolation phenomena become important al low porosities as well as at high conversions. In the former case isolated pores are initially present which become accessible as conversion increases. In the latter case, for gasification, fragmentations can occur due to loss of connectivity of the solid matrix. Pore closure reactions also exhibit percolation effects since pore plugging can lead to open pores becoming inaccessible. The relative significance of the inaccessibility in determining ultimate conversion, however, needs to be assessed...|$|R
40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{concerned}} diseases in the field of orthopaedics. During the process of this disease, articular cartilages are degenerated and worn out at the end stage, which create pain and disabilities to the patients. Although multiple mechanical and biochemical factors may initiate and/or enhance the progression of OA, alternation of biomechanical properties of articular cartilage {{is one of the}} products. There are several major components in articular cartilage; it is believed that each of their contribution cannot be entirely <b>neglected.</b> Superficial <b>zone</b> is mainly consisted with collagen and it was found that the biomechanical properties of this part of cartilage are also alternated significantly as a result of OA. Hence, degeneration of collagen network also occurs. Alternatively, osteoporosis (OP) is another common disease, which is associated to the decrease of bone mineral density; the effect of OP on articular cartilage is limited. In reverse, increasing bone mineral density in subchondral plate alters the loads distribution on articular cartilage and possibly leads to OA. This current study investigated the morphological and biomechanical properties of individual collagen fibrils extracted from OA, OP and healthy cartilages. 	A total of ten joint specimens were recruited, 3 OA joints were from 3 OA patients, 3 OP joints were from 3 OP patients, and 4 joints were from 2 healthy individuals. All cartilages were harvested from non weight-bearing zone, and average diameters were calculated from 350 fibrils’ measurements. In addition, 50 fibrils were randomly selected for nano-indentation under ambient condition. However, the representation of biomechanical properties tested at low humidity may be questionable. This current study also investigated the stiffness of hydrated fibrils. 	The results showed that the collagen fibrils extracted from OA cartilages were thinner than the ones extracted from OP and healthy cartilages. It was believe that the fibrillation and derangement of collagen network spread from superficial zone towards deeper zones. However, the number of thinner collagen fibrils increased in OA specimens could be the reason of the loss of larger fibrils and/or fragmentation occurred in the superficial zone, where contains thinner fibrils. The biomechanical tests showed that fibrils extracted from OA cartilages owned the highest elastic modulus, while the ones from OP had the lowest; significant differences were found between all groups when tested under ambient condition. Alternatively, the same pattern of results could also be found when hydrated fibrils were tested; however, due to the limited amount of samples, only the difference between OA and OP were considered significant. In addition, no individual difference was found; no significant difference between samples within each group could be observed. Since nano-indentations were performed at the center of each fibril, the elastic moduli measured represented the stiffness of the crosslinks and molecules within fibrils. Assuming the triple helix structure of collagen is relatively tough, the decrease of tensile modulus of superficial zone in OA cartilages could due to the changes of the crosslinks between fibrils in collagen network. published_or_final_versionOrthopaedics and TraumatologyMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} the behaviour of waves in the nearshore is essential for coastal engineers as these waves cause beach erosion, coastal flooding and damage to coastal structures. Significantly, the influence of reflected waves is often <b>neglected</b> in surf <b>zone</b> studies, although they are known to influence wave properties and circulation in the nearshore. In this paper, a phase-resolving model is rigorously applied to model conditions from the prototype-scale BARDEXII experiment {{in order to examine}} and assess the influence of swash-based reflection on surf zone hydrodynamics at both the individual wave and time-averaged timescales. Surface elevation is separated into incoming and outgoing signals using the Radon Transform and a crest tracking algorithm is used to extract incident and reflected wave properties. It is found that on steep beaches (tan beta > 1 : 9) the swash-based reflection - the reflection generated in the swash during the backwash contributes significantly to the intrawave variability of individual wave properties such as the wave height to water depth ratio gamma, through the generation of quasi-nodes/antinodes system. For gamma expressed with individual wave heights, variations up to 25 % and 40 % are obtained for the modelled regular and irregular wave tests, whereas it reaches 15 % when {{it is based on the}} significant wave height. The outgoing wave field-induced hydrodynamics is also found to affect time-averaged parameters: undertow and horizontal velocity skewness. The undertow is mainly strengthened, particularly in the shoaling region where the outgoing component dominates over the contribution from the incoming wave field. Offshore of the bar, an onshore-directed flow streaming close to the bed is also generated under the outgoing wave field, and is suspected to help in stabilising the bar position. This, along with the influence of the outgoing wave field on the horizontal velocity skewness and the presence of quasi-standing waves, suggests a complex contribution of the hydrodynamics induced by swash-based reflection into sediment transport rates and nearshore bar generation/migration...|$|R

Heat has become a popular natural tracer to estimate exchange rates between rivers and groundwater. However, quantifying flow patterns and velocities is impeded by spatial and temporal variations of exchange fluxes, insufficient sensors spacing during field investigations, or simplifying assumptions for analysis or modeling such as uniform flow. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate lateral shallow groundwater flow upon river-water infiltration at the shoreline of the riverbed and in the adjacent riparian zone of the River Thur in northeast Switzerland. Here we have applied distributed temperature sensing (DTS) along optical fibers wrapped around tubes to measure high-resolution vertical temperature profiles of the unsaturated zone and shallow riparian groundwater. Diurnal temperature oscillations were tracked in the subsurface and analyzed by means of dynamic harmonic regression to extract amplitudes and phase angles. Subsequent calculations of amplitude attenuation and time shift relative to the river signal show in detail vertical and temporal variations of heat transport in shallow riparian groundwater. In addition, we apply a numerical two-dimensional heat transport model for the unsaturated zone and shallow groundwater to obtain a better understanding of the observed heat transport processes in shallow riparian groundwater and to estimate the groundwater flow velocity. Our results show that the observed riparian groundwater temperature distribution cannot be described by uniform flow, but rather by horizontal groundwater flow velocities varying over depth. In addition, heat transfer of diurnal temperature oscillations from the losing river through shallow groundwater is influenced by thermal exchange with the unsaturated <b>zone.</b> <b>Neglecting</b> the influence of the unsaturated zone would cause biased interpretation and underestimation of groundwater flow velocities. The combination of high resolution field data and modeling shows the complex hydraulic and thermal processes occurring in shallow riparian groundwater close to losing river sections as well as potential errors sources for interpreting diurnal temperature oscillations in such environments...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{to study the}} modification of the stress field at a transcurrent plate boundary due to frictional heat production at depth. Two cases are considered a stable and a stretched lithosphere. The model is applied to those weak faults where the dynamic friction is small compared to a static one; if the deformation along the brittle portion of the fault is entirely accommodated {{by a series of}} seismic ruptures in a quasi-static state where the fault has been moving for millions of years, the long-term thermal field perturbation due to these ruptures results in only a few degrees and can be <b>neglected.</b> The boundary <b>zone</b> is considered as a viscoelastic body subject to a constant strain rate. The lower section of the boundary is assumed to slip aseismically along a vertical transcurrent fault and to completely accommodate the plate motion, while the upper section is locked. The slipping zone is divided into a semi-brittle zone, placed between the isothermal surfaces of 300 °C and 450 °C, and a ductile zone beneath. The frictional heat is calculated by assuming a linearly decreasing friction in the semi-brittle and a constant friction in the ductile zones. The heat modifies the temperature field, producing an upward movement of the semi-brittle and ductile fault sections. As a consequence, the thickness of the brittle fault section is reduced and friction at the base of this section is less. The stress field in the boundary zone is calculated as a function of time for different friction profiles and slip rates on the fault. Owing to heat production, a greater stress concentration is produced on the brittle fault section, while shear stress is lowered in regions occupied by the uplifted semi-brittle layer. These effects are found to be remarkable only {{in the case of a}} stable zone, with a standard unperturbed geotherm, while they are irrelevant in a stretched zone with a high geothermal gradient. In any case, the role of the semi-brittle layer appears to be more prominent in the case of boundaries with higher slip rates, due to the presence of higher stress values...|$|R
