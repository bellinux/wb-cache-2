40|$|In {{almost all}} metal forming processes, such as rolling, extrusion, swaging, and forging etc., both strain-rate and {{temperature}} vary during deformation. Experimental results reveal that many metallic materials show a remarkable strain rate dependence <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> stress at {{warm and hot}} deformation temperature. The work-hardening rate equation previously proposed by the present author, et al. is available to predict the <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> under the conditions of varying strain-rate and varying temperature during deformation. The equation consists of the basic work-hardening rate term and the relative dynamic recovery rate term. Dynamic restoration process in high temperature deformation involves, in some cases, work-softening due to dynamic recrystallization, in addition to dynamic recovery. Then, the work-softening term is newly formulated and added to the previous equation, and some supplemental equations required for constructing the computer program <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> prediction are also developed by the numerical analysis regarding the experimental <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> annealed OFHC copper.
