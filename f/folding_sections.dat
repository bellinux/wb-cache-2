40|$|The {{energetics}} of inorganic nanotubes (INTs) are investigated {{using both}} atomistic and continuum models. A relatively simple (Tersoff-II) potential model {{is used to}} study the energetics of carbon nanotube (C-NT) formation {{for use as a}} well-understood reference system. INTs formed by <b>folding</b> <b>sections</b> of MX stoichiometry constructed from both percolating hexagonal and square-net sheets are modelled. The C-NTs and hexagonal INTs are found to display folding energetics essentially consistent with a continuum elastic model. The square-net INTs are found to display folding energetics which are strongly dependent upon the direction along which the originating sheet is folded (and hence on the morphology of the formed INT). The difference in energies as a function of INT morphology is exemplified by reference to the high symmetry cases (the (n, 0) sq and (n, n) sq INTs) which are discussed in terms of the detailed atomistic interactions...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Army Field Assistance Science and Technology Program {{requested}} Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) {{to demonstrate}} the use of lightweight composite materials in construction of overhead covers for reinforced infantry fighting positions. In recent years, ORNL researchers have designed and tested several concepts for lightweight ballistic protection structures, and they have developed numerous prototype composite structures for military and civilian applications. In the current program, composite panel designs and materials are tested and optimized to meet anticipated static and dynamic load conditions for the overhead cover structure. Ten prototype composite covers were built at ORNL for use in Army field tests. Each composite cover has a nominal surface area of 12 ft[sup 2] and a nominal weight of 8 lb. Four of the prototypes are made with <b>folding</b> <b>sections</b> to improve their handling characteristics. The composite covers exhibit equivalent performance in Army field tests to covers made with conventional materials that weigh four times as much...|$|E

30|$|Folding of GI and GII introns {{was based}} on {{previous}} work by Michel and Westhof (1990), Toor et al. (2001), Lambowitz and Zimmerly (2004) and Hafez and Hausner (2011 a), along with input from the online program RNAweasel ([URL] The literature was also consulted with regard to comparing introns identified in this study with introns and their putative folds, characterized in other studies (Hafez et al. 2013 and citations within). Intron folds compiled at the RNA comparative web site ([URL] were also consulted. Intron sequences (along with flanking exon sequences) were applied to RNAweasel (Lang et al. 2007). This program can identify and, in many cases, classify introns. The program can also predict the intron core sequences {{as it relates to}} the secondary structure (Lang et al. 2007). The mfold online program ([URL] Zuker 2003) was also used to assist in <b>folding</b> <b>sections</b> of the introns. ORF Finder (NCBI; set on genetic code 4) was used to identify potential ORFs within intron sequences. The final intron RNA folds were manually drawn using CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X 6 (Corel Corporation, Ottawa).|$|E

The geology of this section is mainly sedimentary rock (ironstone and clay) laid down in the Paleogene, with some quartzite outcrops.

50|$|User-specified folding {{allows the}} user to <b>fold</b> <b>sections</b> of text using a generic {{selection}} method, but without changing the source code (out-of-band), instead being specified only in the editor. For example, a programmer may select some lines of text and specify {{that they should be}} folded. Folded text might be anonymous or named, and this may be preserved across editing sessions or discarded. Unlike token-based folding, this does not change the source text - it thus is not shared with other editors of the file, and is not visible in the code.|$|R

50|$|As {{shown in}} the diagram, a weak plate under {{compression}} generally forms thrusting sheets, or overlapping sliding sections. This can form a hill and valley landform, with the hills being the strong sections, and the valleys being the highly disturbed thrust faulted and <b>folded</b> <b>sections.</b> After {{a long period of}} erosion the visible landscape may be flattened, with material eroded from the hills filling up the valleys and hiding the underlying hill-and-valley geology. The valley rock is very weak and usually highly weathered, presenting deep, fertile soil; naturally, this is the area that becomes populated. Reflection seismology profiles show the disturbed rock that hides a blind thrust fault.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} a radical {{approach}} to enactivism {{provides a way}} of clarifying and unifying different varieties of enactivism and enactivist-friendly approaches so as to provide a genuine alternative to classical cognitivism. Section 1 reminds readers of the broad church character of the enactivism framework. Section 2 explicates how radical enactivism is best understood not {{as a kind of}} enactivism per se but as a programme for radicalizing and consolidating the many different enactivist offerings. The main work of radical enactivism is to RECtify, existing varieties of enactivism and other cognate approaches so as to strengthen and unify them into a single collective that can rival classical ways of thinking about mind and cognition. Section 3 shows how even seemingly non-enactivist explanatory offerings—such as predictive processing accounts of cognition—might be RECtified and brought within the enactivist explanatory <b>fold.</b> <b>Section</b> 4 reveals why, once RECtified, enactivist offerings, broadly conceived, qualify as genuine and revolutionary alternatives to classical ways of understanding cognition...|$|R
5000|$|A {{different}} concept, sometimes {{also referred}} to as [...] "hyperspace" [...] and similarly used to explain FTL travel in fiction, is that the manifold of ordinary three-dimensional space is curved in four or more [...] "higher" [...] spatial dimensions (a [...] "hyperspace" [...] in the geometric sense; see hypersurface, tesseract, Flatland). This curvature causes certain widely separated points in three-dimensional space to nonetheless be [...] "adjacent" [...] to each other four-dimensionally. Creating an aperture in 4D space (a wormhole) between these locations can allow instantaneous transit between the two locations; a common comparison is that of a folded piece of paper, where a hole punched through two <b>folded</b> <b>sections</b> is more direct than a line drawn between them on the sheet. This idea probably arose out of certain popular descriptions of general relativity and/or Riemannian manifolds, and may be the original form from which later concepts of hyperspace arose.
