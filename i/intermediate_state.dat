5|$|Triceratops species {{possessed a}} sturdy build, with strong limbs, short hands with three hooves each, and short feet with four hooves each. Although {{certainly}} quadrupedal, the posture of these dinosaurs {{has long been}} the subject of some debate. Originally, it was believed that the front legs of the animal had to be sprawling at angles from the thorax in order to better bear the weight of the head. This stance can be seen in paintings by Charles Knight and Rudolph Zallinger. Ichnological evidence in the form of trackways from horned dinosaurs and recent reconstructions of skeletons (both physical and digital) seem to show that Triceratops and other ceratopsids maintained an upright stance during normal locomotion, with the elbows flexed and slightly bowed out, in an <b>intermediate</b> <b>state</b> between fully upright and fully sprawling (as in the modern rhinoceros).|$|E
5|$|Buddhist traditions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} how this transfer proceeds. Transferring merit to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word transfer, the merit of the giver {{is in no way}} decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish. The merit transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must also be able to sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the merit, the act of transferring merit will still be beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing. The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of the merit done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of merit to occur. The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring merit is connected to the notion of an <b>intermediate</b> <b>state.</b> The merit that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth. Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the Pure Land. Another way of transferring merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the devas (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained. Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.|$|E

25|$|The Sarvastivadin Abhidharmikas also {{developed}} the novel {{idea of an}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>state</b> between death and the next rebirth.

40|$|The inelasticity of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>states</b> in the {{unitarity}} {{condition of}} the S-matrix is investigated for high energy elastic scattering of strongly interacting particles. The inelastic process is treated as the multiple production of mesons, for which we have assumed statisti-cal independence. The energy-momentum conservation law in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>states</b> is derived {{in terms of the}} meson momentum distribution, and it is shown that the effective <b>intermediate</b> <b>states</b> are in general varied with the elastic scattering angles. The property of the intermediate' states is discussed with existing experimental data on the multiple meson production. In high energy accelerator researches and analyses of cosmic ray jet, it has been revealed that the momentum distribution of the secondaries is sharply peaked in the longitudinal direction and the average transverse momentum is constant independent of the incident energies. From these experimental results, we show that the inelasticity of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>states</b> responsible for large angle elastic scattering is quite small compared with that for small angle elastic scattering...|$|R

25|$|Many {{transitions}} involving {{electromagnetic radiation}} are strictly forbidden under quantum mechanics. The allowed transitions are described by so-called selection rules, which describe {{the conditions under}} which a radiative transition is allowed. For instance, transitions are only allowed if ΔS=0, S being the total spin angular momentum of the system. In real materials other effects, such as interactions with the crystal lattice, intervene to circumvent the formal rules by providing alternate mechanisms. In these systems the forbidden transitions can occur, but usually at slower rates than allowed transitions. A classic example is phosphorescence where a material has a ground state with S=0, an excited state with S=0, and an <b>intermediate</b> <b>state</b> with S=1. The transition from the <b>intermediate</b> <b>state</b> to the ground state by emission of light is slow because of the selection rules. Thus emission may continue after the external illumination is removed. In contrast fluorescence in materials is characterized by emission which ceases when the external illumination is removed.|$|E
25|$|In an open space, {{the vortex}} fades and finally disappears. If the vortex's {{expansion}} is obstructed, and symmetry is broken, the vortex breaks into cyclical form.

The resulting transformation subsequently becomes visible once the energy is concentrated into the final spherical stage.|$|E
25|$|Once in {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium, a system's properties are, by definition, unchanging in time.

25|$|Consider a solid {{consisting}} of a single molecular species and subjected to melting. Ultimately it is rendered to an isotropic state classically referred to as liquid. Mesophases occur before then when an <b>intermediate</b> <b>state</b> of order is still maintained as in the nematic, smectic, and columnar phases of liquid crystals. Mesophases thus exhibit anisotropy. For instance, LCD devices work on the optical switch principle that obscures light or lets it pass. This switch is turned off and on by an electric field applied to the mesogen with director. The response of the director to the field is expressed with viscosity parameters, as in the Ericksen-Leslie theory in continuum mechanics developed by Jerald Ericksen and Frank Matthews Leslie.|$|E
