25|$|For {{women with}} heavy menstrual bleeding, estrogen-containing oral {{contraceptive}} medications {{are effective in}} reducing the frequency and duration of the menstrual periods. Estrogen and progesterone compounds available {{for use in the}} correction of menorrhagia are <b>ethinylestradiol</b> and levonorgestrel (Levona, Nordette, Lutera, Trivora). Administration of <b>ethinylestradiol</b> diminishes the secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone from the pituitary, leading to stabilization of the endometrial surface of the uterus.|$|E
25|$|A woman using COCPs excretes {{from her}} urine and feces natural estrogens, estrone (E1) and {{estradiol}} (E2), and synthetic estrogen <b>ethinylestradiol</b> (EE2).|$|E
25|$|As {{can be seen}} in {{the table}} above, {{similarly}} to <b>ethinylestradiol,</b> DES shows a marked and disproportionately strong effect on hepatic protein production.|$|E
25|$|The first oral {{contraceptive}} introduced outside the United States was Schering's Anovlar (norethisterone acetate 4mg + <b>ethinylestradiol</b> 50µg) on January 1, 1961 in Australia.|$|E
25|$|The Ortho Evra {{contraceptive}} {{patch and}} the Evra contraceptive patch are both intended to gradually release into the systemic circulation approximately 20µg/day of <b>ethinylestradiol</b> and 150µg/day of norelgestromin.|$|E
25|$|First {{generation}} COCPs {{are sometimes}} {{defined as those}} containing the progestins noretynodrel, norethisterone, norethisterone acetate, or etynodiol acetate; and sometimes defined as all COCPs containing ≥ 50µg <b>ethinylestradiol.</b>|$|E
25|$|The optimal ranges for {{estrogen}} {{apply only}} to individuals taking estradiol (or an ester of estradiol), and not to those taking synthetic or other non-bioidentical preparations (e.g., CEEs or <b>ethinylestradiol).</b>|$|E
25|$|Estrogens {{have been}} used in the {{treatment}} of prostate cancer. The estrogens that {{have been used}} include diethylstilbestrol, fosfestrol (diethylstilbestrol diphosphate), <b>ethinylestradiol,</b> <b>ethinylestradiol</b> sulfonate, polyestradiol phosphate, and estradiol undecylate, as well as the combined estrogenic and nitrogen mustard alkylating antineoplastic agent estramustine phosphate. Newer estrogens with improved tolerability and safety like GTx-758 have also been studied. Estrogens are effective in the treatment of prostate cancer because they are functional antiandrogens. They both suppress testosterone concentrations to castrate levels via their antigonadotropic activity and they reduce the percentage of free and bioavailable testosterone by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin production and levels. Estrogens {{have been found to be}} equivalent in effectiveness to androgen deprivation therapy with castration and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. However, they significantly increase cardiovascular mortality, and for this reason, are now little used in prostate cancer. Although the most commonly employed estrogens like diethylstilbestrol and <b>ethinylestradiol</b> are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, it is notable that certain estrogens, namely polyestradiol phosphate, have been found not to do so; this is attributed to different degrees of effect of the various estrogens on hepatic protein synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Second {{generation}} COCPs {{are sometimes}} {{defined as those}} containing the progestins norgestrel or levonorgestrel; and sometimes defined as those containing the progestins norethisterone, norethisterone acetate, etynodiol acetate, norgestrel, levonorgestrel, or norgestimate and < 50nbsp&µg <b>ethinylestradiol.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{review of}} {{activated}} sludge plant performance found estrogen removal rates varied considerably but averaged 78% for estrone, 91% for estradiol, and 76% for <b>ethinylestradiol</b> (estriol effluent concentrations are between those of estrone and estradiol, but estriol is a much less potent endocrine disruptor to fish).|$|E
25|$|Since {{estrogen}} {{circulating in}} the blood can negatively feedback to reduce circulating levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), most oral contraceptives contain <b>ethinylestradiol,</b> along with a progestin (synthetic progestogen). Even in men, the major hormone involved in LH feedback is estradiol, not testosterone.|$|E
25|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}} occurs {{more frequently in}} the first year of treatment with estrogens. The risk is higher with oral estrogens (particularly <b>ethinylestradiol</b> and conjugated estrogens) than with injectable, transdermal, implantable, and nasal formulations. DVT risk also increases with age and in patients who smoke, so many clinicians advise using the safer estrogen formulations in smokers and patients older than 40.|$|E
25|$|High {{doses of}} potent estrogens such as {{diethylstilbestrol}} and <b>ethinylestradiol</b> {{were used in}} the past in the treatment of breast cancer. Their effectiveness is approximately equivalent to that of antiestrogen therapy with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. The use of high dose estrogen therapy in breast cancer has mostly been superseded by antiestrogen therapy due to the improved safety profile of the latter.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 95% of orally {{ingested}} estradiol is inactivated during first-pass metabolism. Nonetheless, {{levels of}} estradiol {{in the liver}} with oral administration are supraphysiological and approximately 4- to 5-fold higher than in circulation due to the first-pass. This does not occur with parenteral estradiol. In contrast to estradiol, <b>ethinylestradiol</b> is much more resistant to hepatic metabolism, with a mean oral bioavailability of approximately 45%, and has a similar impact on hepatic protein synthesis with both oral and transdermal routes.|$|E
25|$|NET is {{a potent}} {{progestogen}} and a weak androgen and estrogen. That is, it {{is a potent}} agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR) and a weak agonist of the androgen receptor (AR) and the estrogen receptor (ER). NET itself has insignificant affinity for the ER; its estrogenic activity is from an active metabolite that is formed in very small amounts, <b>ethinylestradiol</b> (EE), {{which is a very}} potent estrogen. NET and its metabolites have negligible affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and hence have no glucocorticoid, antiglucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, or antimineralocorticoid activity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ethinylestradiol</b> (EE) is a {{more potent}} {{synthetic}} analogue of estradiol that is used widely in hormonal contraceptives. Mestranol, moxestrol, and quinestrol are derivatives of EE used clinically. A related drug is methylestradiol, which is also used clinically. Conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs), such as Premarin, a commonly prescribed estrogenic drug produced from the urine of pregnant mares, include the natural steroidal estrogens equilin and equilenin, as well as, especially, estrone sulfate (which itself is inactive and becomes active upon conversion into estrone). A related and very similar product to CEEs is esterified estrogens (EEs).|$|E
25|$|In 1931, Butenandt {{found that}} the benzoic acid ester of estrone had a {{prolonged}} duration of action. Subsequently, Schwenk and Hildebrant synthesized estradiol benzoate from estradiol in 1933, and estradiol benzoate was introduced by Schering-Kahlbaum for medical use via intramuscular injection under the brand name Progynon-B in 1936. It was the first estrogen ester to be marketed, and has since been followed by many additional esters, for instance estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate in the 1950s. <b>Ethinylestradiol</b> was synthesized from estradiol by Inhoffen and Hohlweg in 1938 and was introduced for oral use by Schering in the United States under the brand name Estinyl in 1943. It remains widely used in combined oral contraceptives.|$|E
25|$|All {{combined}} hormonal {{birth control}} products {{have a very}} small increased risk of serious or fatal thromboembolic events. There is ongoing research into the thromboembolic risks of Ortho Evra as compared to combined oral contraceptive pills. A {{recent study found that}} users of the contraceptive patch may have a twofold increased risk for non-fatal venous thromboembolic events compared with women who took a norgestimate-containing oral contraceptive with 35µg of estrogen. However, a different study concluded that the risk of nonfatal venous thromboembolism for the contraceptive patch is similar to the risk for oral contraceptives containing 35µg of <b>ethinylestradiol</b> and norgestimate. The contradiction in findings between the two studies is not easily resolved, because the confidence intervals for the studies are overlapping.|$|E
25|$|High dose {{estrogen}} {{therapy with}} estrogens such as diethylstilbestrol, <b>ethinylestradiol,</b> and estradiol undecylate {{has been used}} in the past to treat prostate cancer in men. It is effective because estrogens are functional antiandrogens, capable of suppressing testosterone levels to castrate concentrations and decreasing free testosterone levels by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) production. High dose estrogen therapy is associated with poor tolerability and safety, namely severe gynecomastia and cardiovascular complications such as thrombosis, and for this reason, has largely been replaced by newer antiandrogens such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. It is still sometimes used in the treatment of prostate cancer however, and newer estrogens with atypical profiles such as GTx-758 that have improved tolerability profiles are being studied for possible application in prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|Comparisons between orally {{administered}} {{pill and}} transdermal patch suggests that when estrogens are taken orally {{the risks of}} thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism are increased, an effect which is not seen with topical administration. Transdermal and transvaginal administration {{are not subject to}} first pass metabolism, and so lack the anabolic effects that oral therapy has on hepatic synthesis of Vitamin K dependent clotting factors. This effect refers only to patches for post menopausal hormone replacement, which contain estradiol, not those used in oral contraceptive therapy, which contain <b>ethinylestradiol.</b> The latter is associated with an increased incidence of venous clot. The WHI also showed an increased incidence arterial disease, namely stroke, in patients who began HRT after the age of 65, although this effect was not significantly present in those who began therapy during their fifth decade.|$|E
25|$|Combined {{estrogen}} (<b>ethinylestradiol)</b> and progestin (levonorgestrel or norgestrel) pills used to {{be available}} as dedicated emergency contraceptive pills under several brand names: Schering PC4, Tetragynon, Neoprimavlar, and Preven (in the United States) but were withdrawn after more effective dedicated progestin-only (levonorgestrel) emergency contraceptive pills with fewer side effects became available. If other more effective dedicated emergency contraceptive pills (levonorgestrel, ulipristal acetate, or mifepristone) are not available, specific combinations of regular combined oral contraceptive pills can be taken in split doses 12hours apart (the Yuzpe regimen), effective up to 72hours after intercourse. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved this off-label use of certain brands of regular combined oral contraceptive pills in 1997. As of 2014, there are 26brands of regular combined oral contraceptive pills containing levonorgestrel or norgestrel available in the United States {{that can be used}} in the emergency contraceptive Yuzpe regimen.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen {{is one of}} the {{two major}} sex hormones in XX chromosomed {{individuals}} (the other being progesterone), and is responsible for the development and maintenance of feminine secondary sexual characteristics, such as breasts, wide hips, and a feminine pattern of fat distribution. Estrogens act by binding to and activating the estrogen receptor (ER), their biological target in the body. A variety of different forms of estrogen are available and used medically. The most common estrogens used in transgender women include estradiol (which is the predominant natural estrogen in women) and estradiol esters such as estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate (which are prodrugs of estradiol). Conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs), marketed as Premarin, and <b>ethinylestradiol</b> are also sometimes used, but this is becoming less common. Estrogens may be administered orally, sublingually, transdermally (via patch), topically (via gel), by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, or by an implant.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone can be metabolized by {{aromatase}} into estradiol, {{and many}} other AAS can be metabolized into their corresponding estrogenic metabolites as well. As an example, the 17α-alkylated AAS methyltestosterone and metandienone are converted by aromatase into methylestradiol. 4,5α-Dihydrogenated derivatives of testosterone such as DHT cannot be aromatized, whereas 19-nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone can be but to a greatly reduced extent. Some 19-nortestosterone derivatives, such as dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, cannot be aromatized due to steric hindrance provided by their 11β-methyl group, whereas the closely related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone), in relation to its lack of an 11β-methyl group, can be aromatized. AAS that are 17α-alkylated (and not also 4,5α-reduced or 19-demethylated) are also aromatized but {{to a lesser extent}} than is testosterone. However, it is notable that estrogens that are 17α-substituted (e.g., <b>ethinylestradiol</b> and methylestradiol) are of markedly increased estrogenic potency due to improved metabolic stability, and for this reason, 17α-alkylated AAS can actually have high estrogenicity and comparatively greater estrogenic effects than testosterone.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ethinylestradiol</b> {{or other}} {{synthetic}} estrogens along with luteal phase progesterone (twice daily 200mg vaginal suppositories) and estradiol support. <b>Ethinylestradiol</b> lowers high FSH levels which then, it is theorized, up regulates FSH receptor sites and restores sensitivity to FSH. [...] <b>Ethinylestradiol</b> {{also has the}} advantage {{that it does not}} interfere with the measurement of serum levels of endogenous estradiol. [...] During the luteal phase the FSH levels should be kept low for subsequent cycles, thus the phase is supplemented with 4mg oral estradiol. [...] Since conception may have occurred estradiol is used instead of the synthetic <b>ethinylestradiol.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Both {{combined}} {{oral contraceptives}} (which contain <b>ethinylestradiol</b> and a progestin) and pregnancy/the postpartum period {{are associated with}} about a 4-fold increase in risk of VTE, with the risk increase being slightly greater with the latter ( [...] = 4.03 and 4.24, respectively). The risk of VTE during the postpartum period is 5-fold higher than during pregnancy. For combined oral contraceptives, VTE risk with high doses of <b>ethinylestradiol</b> (>50μg, e.g., 100 to 150μg) {{has been reported to}} be approximately twice that of low doses of <b>ethinylestradiol</b> (e.g., 20 to 50μg). As such, high doses of <b>ethinylestradiol</b> are no longer used in combined oral contraceptives, and all modern combined oral contraceptives contain 50μg <b>ethinylestradiol</b> or less. The absolute risk of VTE in pregnancy is about 0.5 to 2 in 1,000 (0.125%).|$|E

2500|$|All {{contain an}} estrogen, <b>ethinylestradiol</b> or mestranol, in varying amounts, {{and one of}} a number of {{different}} progestogens. (Regarding the estrogen, the inactive 3-methyl ether of <b>ethinylestradiol,</b> which must be metabolized by the liver into the active ethinylestradiol; 50µg of mestranol is equivalent to only 35µg of <b>ethinylestradiol</b> and should not be used when high-dose [...] estrogen pills are needed; mestranol was the estrogen used in the first oral contraceptive, Enovid). They are usually taken for 21 days with then a seven-day gap during which a withdrawal bleed (often, but incorrectly, referred to as a menstrual period) occurs. These differ in the amount of estrogen given, and whether they are monophasic (the same dose of estrogen and progestogen during each of the 21 days) or multiphasic (varying doses). The introduction of extended-cycle monophasic pills (i.e. Seasonale) has shown that the withdrawal bleeding intervals can be decreased.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two main}} classes of {{hormonal}} contraceptives: combined contraceptives contain both an estrogen (usually <b>ethinylestradiol)</b> and a progestin. [...] Progestogen-only contraceptives contain only progesterone or a synthetic analogue (progestin). [...] Also marketed is ormeloxifene; while not a hormone, ormeloxifene acts on the hormonal system to prevent pregnancy.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "synthetic" [...] is {{also used}} {{incorrectly}} by lay [...] "experts" [...] in two different ways - {{to refer to the}} process used to manufacture all estrogens, including bioidentical estrogens, and to compounds that interact with estrogen receptors similarly to estrogen molecules, but that are not found in nature. [...] Examples of the latter two include diethylstilbestrol and <b>ethinylestradiol.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Pretreatment with 50 mcg <b>ethinylestradiol</b> {{three times}} a day for two weeks, {{followed}} by recombinant FSH 200 IU/day subcutaneously. [...] <b>Ethinylestradiol</b> treatment was maintained during FSH stimulation. [...] When at least one follicle reached 18mm in diameter and serum estradiol was greater or equal to 150 pg/ML ovulation was induced with an intramuscular injection of 10,000 IU of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin hormone). [...] For luteal phase support 5,000 IU of hCG was administered every 72 hours. [...] Out of 25 patients 8 ovulated and 4 became pregnant. [...] In the control group there were no ovulations. [...] The patients ranged in age between 24 and 39 years with an average age of 32.7. [...] All women had amenorrhea for at least 6 months (average 16.75 months) and FSH levels greater or equal than 40 mIU/mL (average FSH 68 mIU/ML). [...] The researchers believe this protocol would work for women in early post menopause as well.|$|E
2500|$|NET {{is used as}} a {{hormonal}} contraceptive in combination with an estrogen – usually <b>ethinylestradiol</b> (EE) – in combined oral contraceptive pills and alone in progestogen-only pills. NET has also been proven to be effective in inhibiting LH and FSH levels in men as well. Without these hormones, mature sperm cannot survive in the testes. This means that NET could also be an effective male {{hormonal contraceptive}}. Aside from its use as a contraceptive, NET can be used to treat premenstrual syndrome, dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, irregular menstruation, menopausal symptoms (in combination with estrogen), or to postpone a period. It is also commonly used to help prevent uterine hemorrhage in complicated non-surgical or pre-surgical gynecologic cases and in treating non responsive cyclical mastalgia.|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, British {{scientists}} {{obtained a}} patent on a newly formulated nonsteroidal estrogen, diethylstilbestrol (DES), that was cheaper and {{more powerful than the}} previously manufactured estrogens. Soon after, concerns over the side effects of DES were raised in scientific journals while the drug manufacturers came together to lobby for governmental approval of DES. It was only until 1941 when estrogen therapy was finally approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Premarin (conjugated equine estrogens) was introduced in 1941 and succeeded Emmenin, the sales of which had begun to drop after 1940 due to competition from DES. <b>Ethinylestradiol</b> was synthesized in 1938 by Hans Herloff Inhoffen and Walter Hohlweg at Schering AG in Berlin and was approved by the [...] in the [...] on June 25, 1943 and marketed by Schering as Estinyl.|$|E
