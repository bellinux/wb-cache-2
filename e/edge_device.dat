25|$|Droops are a type {{of leading}} <b>edge</b> <b>device,</b> mounted as {{they are on the}} rounded front part of a wing. The Airbus A380 has a droop between the {{fuselage}} and each inboard engine, at {{the leading edge of the}} thickest part of each wing. Early variants of the Hawker Siddeley Trident had two droops on the outboard of each wing and a Krueger flap on the section closest to the fuselage.|$|E

40|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>devices</b> such as desktop and laptop {{computers}} constitute {{a majority of}} the devices connected to the Internet today. Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) file-sharing applications generally require <b>edge</b> <b>devices</b> to maintain network presence whenever possible to enhance the robustness of the file-sharing network, which in turn can lead to considerable wastage of energy. We show that energy can be saved by permitting <b>edge</b> <b>devices</b> to enter into standby state and still maintain network connectivity by proxying protocols in the Network Interface Card (NIC). 1...|$|R

40|$|Previous studies {{demonstrated}} that Ethemet {{local area network}} traffic is statistically self-similar and that the commonly used Poisson models {{are not able to}} capture the fractal characteristics of Ethemet traffic. This contribution uses simulated self-similar traffic traces from the MITRE Corporation and Sandia`s simulation software to evaluate the ABR performance of an ATM backbone. The ATM backbone interconnects Ethemet LANs via <b>edge</b> <b>devices</b> such as routers and bridges. We evaluate the overall network performance in terms of throughput, response time, fairness, and buffer requirements. Because typical <b>edge</b> <b>devices</b> perform simple forwarding functions, their usual mechanism for signaling network congestion is packet dropping. Therefore, we believe that the proper provisioning of buffer resources in ATM <b>edge</b> <b>devices</b> is crucial to the overall network performance...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the total energy {{consumed}} by the Internet has followed an increasing trend over the years. A considerable part of this energy is wasted due to an inefficient utilization of <b>edge</b> <b>devices,</b> i. e., Personal Computers (PCs) and other user equipment in homes and offices. PCs are often left on even when they are not used (e. g., overnight or during weekends), while other <b>edge</b> <b>devices,</b> such as printers, IP phones, and displays, are typically kept always on, especially in public buildings. A number of solutions have been proposed for eliminating, or reducing, energy wastes due to <b>edge</b> <b>devices.</b> In this chapter we propose a general taxonomy for their classification. Then, according to the introduced taxonomy, we survey the main proposals appeared in the literature. Finally, we highlight some open issues...|$|R
30|$|GPUs are {{anticipated}} to {{be a key}} enabler for {{the next}} generation SDN [166, 465]. GPU-accelerated SDN routers are reported to have a much improved packet processing capability. Furthermore, the GPUs on SDN controllers may be particularly useful for executing ML and DL algorithms for learning various networking scenarios, and acting according to the acquired knowledge. On the other hand, smaller, resource constrained, smart networked devices, are more likely to benefit from a cloud-edge ML system. A cloud-edge ML system would leverage the large processing and memory resources, robust networks, and massive storage capabilities of the cloud for training computationally intensive models and sharing these with <b>edge</b> <b>devices.</b> Data collection and analytics that require immediate or near-immediate response time would be handled by <b>edge</b> <b>devices.</b> Light-weight ML software systems, such as Caffe 2 Go and TensorFlowLite, would eventually enable <b>edge</b> <b>devices</b> to by-pass the cloud and build leaner models locally.|$|R
30|$|Putting more {{focus on}} the <b>edge</b> <b>devices,</b> i.e., IoT gateways, network devices, cloudlets and small clouds, {{different}} approaches have emerged recently. For example, in [20] the authors present a concept of fog computing and define its main characteristics, such as location awareness, reduced latency and general QoS improvements. They focus on defining a virtualized platform that includes the <b>edge</b> <b>devices</b> and enables running custom application logic atop different resources throughout the network. Similarly, Cloudlets [6] and small clouds [21] are introduced as intermediary infrastructure nodes (between the <b>edge</b> <b>devices</b> and data centers), {{which can be used}} to reduce network delays, processing time and costs. The SDG-Pro framework also aims at better utilization of the edge infrastructure, but we focus on providing a systematic approach, supporting application developers to address most of the infrastructure provisioning and governance issues programmatically, in a logically centralized fashion, by offering the software-defined gateways and well-defined provisioning and governance APIs.|$|R
5000|$|The 1000 switch {{family is}} {{considered}} an <b>edge</b> <b>device,</b> having many functionalities that can be built as the device is very modular. The 1900 line {{as a whole is}} past end-of-sale and end-of-life, and is considered a retired product line.|$|E
50|$|An edge switch for a WAN {{may be a}} {{multiservice}} unit, {{meaning that}} it supports {{a wide variety of}} communication technologies, including Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), T1 circuits, frame relay, and ATM. An <b>edge</b> <b>device</b> may provide enhanced services, such as virtual private networking (VPN) support, Voice over IP, and QoS services.|$|E
50|$|In PBB and PBT {{switches}} at {{the edge}} of the carrier network encapsulate customer traffic within an 802.1ah frame. The carrier network core is only responsible for transporting frames from an <b>edge</b> <b>device</b> to another, alleviating Q-in-Qâ€™s issue of forwarding table scalability. The same feature - assigning a MAC address per <b>edge</b> <b>device,</b> not per service - creates a scalability issue for multipoint services. Multipoint services require full mesh connectivity between edge devices, a very inefficient method as all frames are duplicated at the root nodes, rather than at the optimal point as in VLAN connectivity. Moreover, the need to create forwarding entries for each unicast connection within the full mesh (as opposed to a single VLAN forwarding tree in the case of VLAN connectivity) will quickly become unsustainable as multipoint services become predominant in the near future.|$|E
5000|$|Histories: {{modeling}} and querying of time sampled point data. Typically <b>edge</b> <b>devices</b> collect a time stamped history of point values {{which can be}} fed into higher level applications for analysis.|$|R
5000|$|Similar, but retractable, leading <b>edge</b> <b>devices</b> {{are called}} slats. [...] When the slat opens, {{it creates a}} slot between the slat and the {{remainder}} of the wing; retracted, the drag is reduced.|$|R

50|$|An <b>edge</b> <b>device</b> is {{a device}} which {{provides}} an entry point into enterprise or service provider core networks. Examples include routers, routing switches, integrated access devices (IADs), multiplexers, {{and a variety}} of metropolitan area network (MAN) and wide area network (WAN) access devices. Edge devices also provide connections into carrier and service provider networks.|$|E
50|$|Corporate {{networks}} also {{typically have}} {{a limited number of}} internal address blocks in use. An <b>edge</b> <b>device</b> at the boundary between the internal corporate network and external networks (such as the Internet) is used to perform egress checks against packets leaving the internal network, verifying that the source IP address in all outbound packets is within the range of allocated internal address blocks.|$|E
50|$|The Gurney Flap (or wickerbill) {{is a small}} tab {{projecting}} from {{the trailing edge of}} a wing. Typically it is set at a right angle to the pressure side surface of the airfoil,and projects 1% to 2% of the wing chord.This trailing <b>edge</b> <b>device</b> can improve the performance of a simple airfoil to nearly the same level as a complex high-performance design.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Texas A&M University 7 by 10 foot Low Speed Wind Tunnel to provide a direct comparison {{of the effect of}} several leading <b>edge</b> <b>devices</b> on the aerodynamic performance of a highly swept wing configuration. Analysis of the data indicates that for the configuration with undeflected leading edges, vortex separation first occurs on the outboard wing panel for angles of attack of approximately 2, and wing apex vorticies become apparent for alpha or = 4 deg. However, the occurrence of the leading edge vortex flow may be postponed with leading <b>edge</b> <b>devices.</b> Of the devices considered, the most promising were a simple leading edge deflection of 30 deg and a leading edge slat system. The trailing edge flap effectiveness was found to be essentially the same for the configuration employing either of these more promising leading <b>edge</b> <b>devices.</b> Analysis of the lateral directional data showed that for all of the concepts considered, deflecting leading edge downward in an attempt to postpone leading edge vortex flows, has the favorable effect of reducing the effective dihedral...|$|R
30|$|IoT is {{not without}} its challenges. The {{relatively}} small size and heterogeneity of connected <b>edge</b> <b>devices</b> typically results in limited storage and processing capacity, and consequential issues regarding reliability, performance, and security [4]. These limitations are exacerbated when one considers that IoT applications typically require significant data storage and processing as well as high-speed broadband networks to enable real-time decision making [5]. For instance, in the case of e-health monitoring systems, while the data generated by sensors could be used in diagnostic scenarios ranging from spine injuries to heart disease to cancer, medical image analysis often requires high performance processing and storage resources that are not available from <b>edge</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
40|$|We are {{witnessing}} {{the emergence of}} new big data processing architectures due to the convergence of the Internet of Things (IoTs), edge computing and cloud computing. Existing big data processing architectures are underpinned by the transfer of raw data streams to the cloud computing environment for processing and analysis. This operation is expensive and fails to meet the real-time processing needs of IoT applications. In this article, we present and evaluate a novel big data processing architecture named RedEdge (i. e., data reduction on the edge) that incorporates mechanism to facilitate the processing of big data streams near the source of the data. The RedEdge model leverages mobile IoT-termed mobile <b>edge</b> <b>devices</b> as primary data processing platforms. However, {{in the case of the}} unavailability of computational and battery power resources, it offloads data streams in nearer mobile <b>edge</b> <b>devices</b> or to the cloud. We evaluate the RedEdge architecture and the related mechanism within a real-world experiment setting involving 12 mobile users. The experimental evaluation reveals that the RedEdge model has the capability to reduce big data stream by up to 92. 86 % without compromising energy and memory consumption on mobile <b>edge</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{personalized}} content {{can not be}} cached, {{it might}} be queued on an <b>edge</b> <b>device.</b> That means, that a device stores a list of possible responses, which are ready to be served. This is different than caching, as a prefetched response is only served once. This can be especially useful for accelerating responses of third party APIs, such as advertisements.|$|E
50|$|Point-to-point {{services}} are provisioned using a unique HVID per service. Planning HVIDs wisely enables summarization (as {{shown at the}} leftmost <b>edge</b> <b>device)</b> and reduces the number of forwarding entries to a strict minimum; the network now scales to support millions of point-to-point services with minimum packet overhead (it can be noted that no encapsulation was used, frames were forwarded using HVID only).|$|E

Commercial and scientific applications have come to rely on it as a development tool due to its exceptional characteristics in processing power and storage. The trend has been augmented with the emergence of the Internet of Things and smart processing <b>devices</b> at the <b>edge.</b> Contrary to the line of thought commonly adopted, we present in this work an alternative platform that considers <b>edge</b> <b>devices</b> as possible processing nodes, and provide a two-level task scheduling deployment that can handle not only binary modules, but also code-level fragmentations. We also go through a simple implementation of the platform, using production-ready solutions, while validating it on public and private clouds, and physically-separated <b>edge</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{some small}} systems, a single central device decides {{ahead of time}} the {{complete}} path of every packet.In some other small systems, whichever <b>edge</b> <b>device</b> injects a packet into the network decides ahead of time the complete path of that particular packet.In both of these systems, that route-planning device needs {{to know a lot}} of information about what devices are connected to the network and how they are connected to each other.Once it has this information, it can use an algorithm such as A* search algorithm to find the best path.|$|E
50|$|Edge devices may {{translate}} {{between one}} type of network protocol and another. For example, Ethernet or token ring types of local area networks (LANs) or xDSL equipment may use an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) backbone to other core networks. ATM networks send data in cells and use connection-oriented virtual circuits. An IP network is packet oriented; so if ATM {{is used as a}} core, packets must be encapsulated in cells and the destination address must be converted to a virtual circuit identifier. Some new types of optical fibre use a Passive optical network subscriber loop such as GPON, with the <b>edge</b> <b>device</b> connecting to Ethernet for backhaul (telecommunications).|$|E
