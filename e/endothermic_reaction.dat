25|$|In case (a), {{which is}} an {{exothermic}} reaction, {{the energy of the}} transition state is closer in energy to that of the reactant than that of the intermediate or the product. Therefore, from the postulate, the structure of the transition state also more closely resembles that of the reactant. In case (b), the energy of the transition state is close to neither the reactant nor the product, making none of them a good structural model for the transition state. Further information would be needed in order to predict the structure or characteristics of the transition state. Case (c) depicts the potential diagram for an <b>endothermic</b> <b>reaction,</b> in which, according to the postulate, the transition state should more closely resemble that of the intermediate or the product.|$|E

2500|$|An {{example of}} the “late” {{transition}} state is bromination. Bromination favors the reactants {{because it is an}} <b>endothermic</b> <b>reaction,</b> which means that the reactants are lower in energy than the products. Since the transition state is hard to observe, the postulate of bromination helps to picture the “late” transition state (see the representation of the [...] "late" [...] transition state).

2500|$|Therefore, the {{geometric}} {{structure of a}} state can be predicted by comparing its energy to the species neighboring it along the reaction coordinate.

[...] Therefore, the transition state will be more geometrically similar to the reactants than to the products. [...] In contrast, however, in an <b>endothermic</b> <b>reaction</b> the transition state is closer in energy to the products than to the reactants.

2500|$|Reactions can be exothermic, where ΔH is {{negative}} and energy is released.
