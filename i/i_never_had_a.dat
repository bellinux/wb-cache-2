I think, however, that the development of his mind is still more remarkable than the amount of his knowledge.|$|E
500|$|As king, Edward VII {{proved a}} greater success {{than anyone had}} expected, {{but he was already}} past the average life {{expectancy}} and had little time left to fulfil the role. In his short reign, he ensured that his second son and heir, George V, was better prepared to take the throne. Contemporaries described their relationship as more like affectionate brothers than father and son, and on Edward's death George wrote in his diary that he had lost his [...] "best friend and the best of fathers... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> [...] word with him in my life. I am heart-broken and overwhelmed with grief".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with XXL magazine, rapper Fat Joe claimed that he helped produce the track while working with producer Scott Storch. He stated: [...] "I'm pretty sure the world don't know we actually produced Candy Shop together. I produced it with him (Storch) ... Scott called me like 50 times, 100 times: 'Yo, you sure you don't want to use it? 50 Cent called me. 50 Cent want it.' <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> problem with this dude. I was like, 'Go ahead.'" [...] When writing the song, 50 Cent stated: [...] "I attempted to be as sexual as possible, from a male perspective, without being vulgar or obscene".|$|E

500|$|In 1983, Baker {{published}} an autobiography titled Baby Doll: An Autobiography, which detailed {{her life and}} career as an actress and revealed the issues with Paramount and Warner Bros. that had led her to move to Europe in the 1970s and pursue a career in Italian films. Baker said to Regis Philbin, when he interviewed her for Lifetime Television in 1986, that she [...] "didn't want to write an autobiography... but I wanted to write, and I knew {{that would be the}} easiest thing to get published." [...] She further commented to Philbin on her writing, saying: [...] "I think I always wanted to write, but I was a little self-conscious about it. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> formal education, and I've always had such a respect for writing. While I could go out and say, even before I started to act, 'Yes, I'm an actress,' I couldn't really say 'I'm a writer.'" [...] In spite of Baker's misgivings, Baby Doll: An Autobiography was well received. She later wrote two other books, To Africa with Love (1986), detailing her time spent in Africa, and a novel titled A Roman Tale (1987).|$|E
500|$|... "She is enigmatic but I {{must tell}} you <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> bad {{experience}} because of her enigma. What it was, she explained this once, is that she did this on purpose. The choice she made as an actress was, in playing the outsider in the Ewing family, she actually maintained somewhat of an outsider position with the cast as social equals. She didn't {{do a lot of}} the hanging out social activities that a lot of us did because we were together so much. So in that sense, she was maybe a few percentage points removed from the swirl that was the social center of our group. At least twice a year Larry Hagman and I would go up to Canada – fishing trips, hunting trips, things like that. Steve Kanaly was included in that group, and we would go up together, and Steve and I would take other trips together. We were a group, and Linda Gray was also a member of that group. Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. It was her own choice and she felt it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela. But the times we were together on the set, waiting for scenes to be shot, in the make-up room and everything, it was nothing but convivial." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2008 Kasparov {{published}} a sympathetic obituary for Bobby Fischer, writing: [...] "I am often asked if I ever met or played Bobby Fischer.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{published in the}} February 1999 issue of Vanity Fair, Lucas said: [...] "When {{you see it in}} six parts, you'll understand.

[...] In 2008, after all six films had been released, Lucas said: [...] "The movies were the story of Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker, and when Luke saves the galaxy and redeems his father, that's where that story ends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schembechler did {{not include}} Wangler in {{his plans for the}} 1980 season, but Wangler spent the summer in Ann Arbor working with {{offensive}} guard Kurt Becker to rehabilitate the knee. [...] Becker recalled that Wangler's recuperation was difficult: [...] "There was so much pain involved that there were tears in his eyes." [...] Wangler described his rehabilitation as follows:"Maybe I was naive, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> doubt I'd play again. [...] I wasn't ready to end my career. [...] I'd do anything to play. [...] The cast came off March 1st and by August 1st I knew I'd be able to play.

2500|$|Former bass guitarist Nick Oliveri, who {{was fired}} by Josh Homme in 2004, {{provided}} backing vocals on [...] "If I Had a Tail", and upon hearing that drummer Dave Grohl was returning to Queens of the Stone Age {{to assist in the}} recording process, Oliveri asked Homme if he too could return on bass guitar. Oliveri noted: [...] "I actually put in a request with Josh. I heard Dave was playing on the record, and I was like, 'Dude! I wanna play bass on it!' I'd be a fool not to ask. If Dave Grohl was playing drums, then I want in. He's an amazing drummer. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> better time in my life than when Dave was in the band." [...] Homme ultimately chose current bassist Michael Shuman, who joined the band in 2007 upon Era Vulgaris release.|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting on his childhood, Fritzl {{initially}} {{described his}} mother as [...] "the best {{woman in the}} world" [...] and [...] "as strict as it was necessary". Later, he expressed a negative opinion {{of his mother and}} claimed that [...] "she used to beat me, hit me until I was lying {{in a pool of blood}} on the floor. It left me feeling totally humiliated and weak. My mother was a servant and she used to work hard all her life, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> kiss from her, I was never cuddled although I wanted it – I wanted her to be good to me." [...] He also claimed that she called him [...] "a Satan, a criminal, a no-good", that he [...] "had a horrible fear of her". In 1959, after Fritzl had married and bought his house, his mother moved in with them. Over time, their roles reversed, and his mother came to fear him. Eventually, he also admitted he had later locked his mother in the attic and bricked up her window after telling neighbors that she had died, and kept her locked up until her death in 1980. It is unknown how long Fritzl kept his mother locked up in his attic, but newspapers have speculated that it may have been up to 20 years.|$|E
2500|$|... “Although she {{was well}} over forty, she had lost none of her high spirits; she was kind and affectionate, but her {{eccentric}} and despotic nature made her rather formidable. When she heard that I {{was going to marry}} her niece, she took me in hand. From that day my life was no longer my own. She was an early riser and she used to telephone me at eight in the morning. Sometimes she came to the Hotel du Rhin, where I was staying, and sat reading the papers in my room while I dressed. If I happened to be out, she sent her servants all over Paris to look for me and sometimes took part in the search herself. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> moment's peace. I had to lunch, dine, go to the theater and supper with her almost every day. She usually slept through the first act of a play, and then woke up with a start to declare that the performance was stupid and that she wished to go somewhere else. We often changed theaters two or three times in one evening. As she felt the cold, she made her footman sit on a chair at the door of her box, holding a small traveling bag filled with shawls, scarves and furs. All these objects were numbered. If by chance, she was awake and felt a draft, she would ask me to bring her such or such a number. I could have put up with all this but unfortunately she had a passion for dancing. At midnight, now wide awake, she would drag me to a night club where she danced till dawn.”The diplomat Maurice Paléologue wrote on 14 October 1913, [...] "Although she is fifty-three, she lives openly with an Argentinian blackguard, dances at Magic City with all comers till two in the morning and associates with the scum of the aerodromes." ...|$|E
