500|$|The {{alcohol in}} beer comes {{primarily}} from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation. The quantity of <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugars</b> in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that {{determine the amount of}} alcohol in the final beer.

To evaluate how the remained ionic liquids in the <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugars</b> affect the subsequent ethanol fermentation process, the effects of ionic liquid 1 - butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim]Cl) in the medium at different concentrations from 10 – 3 to 1 g L– 1 on the morphological structure, growth and ethanol fermentation of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae AY 92022 were investigated and compared with the control. First, the morphological structures of the yeast at different [Bmim]Cl concentrations were observed under an optical microscope. The results show that its single cell morphology remained unchanged at all [Bmim]Cl concentrations, but its reproduction rate by budding decreased with the [Bmim]Cl concentration increasing. Then its growth during ethanol fermentation process at different [Bmim]Cl concentrations was examined. The {{results indicated that the}} ionic liquid [Bmim]Cl inhibited the yeast growth. Its specific growth rate during the log phase and bacterial concentration during the stationary phase all decreased with the increase of [Bmim]Cl concentration. Finally, the ethanol fermentation process at different [Bmim]Cl concentrations was investigated and the results demonstrated that the ionic liquid [Bmim]Cl had a negative effect on ethanol production. When the [Bmim]Cl concentration increased, the final ethanol concentration and its yield from the <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugars</b> decreased, the finally remaining <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugars</b> increased, and it is interesting the ethanol specific formation rate at stationary phase remained unchanged at all [Bmim]Cl concentrations.

50|$|Apart from spoiling foods, as {{a direct}} {{consequent}} of growth, Z. bailii can modify the product texture and composition such {{that it may be}} more readily colonized by other spoilage microorganisms. For example, by utilizing acetic acid, the yeast can raise the pH of pickles sufficiently to allow the growth of less acid-tolerant bacteria. Besides, as with other yeasts, the concentration of <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugar</b> in a product affects the rate of spoilage by Z. bailii, e.g. the yeast grows faster in the presence of 10% (w/w) than 1% (w/w) glucose. Particularly, Z. bailii can grow and cause spoilage from extremely low inocula, as few as one viable cell in ≥ 10 liters of beverages. That means detection of low numbers of yeast cells in a product does not guarantee its stability. No sanitation or microbiological quality control program can cope with this degree of risk. Hence, the only alternatives would be reformulation of food to increase the stability and/or application of high-lethality thermal-processing parameters.|$|E
