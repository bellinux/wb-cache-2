5|$|Classifications {{published}} {{since the}} use of molecular phylogenetics have taken a narrower view of the Liliaceae (s.s.). In 1998, Tamura considered Calochortus sufficiently distinct to elevate the subfamily Calochortoideae to <b>family</b> <b>status</b> as Calochortaceae, resulting in the term Liliaceae sensu Tamura to indicate Liliaceae without the Calochortoideae. In 2009, Takhtajan used an even narrower definition (see Table 2 & Table 3 below).|$|E

5|$|As a {{condition}} of receiving the grant, the P.R. Department of the Family must submit an annual plan of operation to the FNS, which describes how it will distribute the funds assigned as nutrition assistance to qualifying persons.

The plan of operation is reviewed and approved by the FNS before funds are disbursed.|$|E

5|$|Two subfamilies, Hydrobatinae and Oceanitinae, were {{recognized}} in the past within a single large family Hydrobatidae but this has since been split with the elevation of Oceanitidae to <b>family</b> <b>status.</b> The Oceanitinae, or austral storm petrels, were mostly found in southern waters (though Wilson's storm petrel regularly migrates into the northern hemisphere); there were seven species in five genera. The Hydrobatinae, or northern storm petrels, were the two genera Hydrobates and Oceanodroma. They were largely restricted to the northern hemisphere, although a few visit or breed a short distance south of the equator. Cytochrome b DNA sequence analysis suggested that the family was paraphyletic and more accurately treated as two distinct families. The same {{study found that the}} austral storm petrels are basal within Procellariiformes. The first split was the family Oceanitidae, with the Hydrobatidae splitting {{from the rest of the}} order at a later date. A few fossil species have been found, with the earliest being from the Upper Miocene.|$|E

50|$|Like the Bambara Empire to the east, the Khasso kingdoms {{depended}} {{heavily on}} the slave trade for their economy. A <b>family's</b> <b>status</b> was indicated {{by the number of}} slaves it owned, leading to wars {{for the sole purpose of}} taking more captives. This trade led the Khasso into increasing contact with the European settlements of Africa's west coast, particularly the French.|$|R
30|$|The {{scarcity}} of quality schooling resources makes the competition to be fierce. From Fig.  3 and Table  6, {{it can be}} seen that the effect coefficient of <b>family</b> socio-economic <b>status</b> on the quality of school children attending is 0.11 standard units, that is, if the <b>family’s</b> socioeconomic <b>status</b> is increased by 1 standard unit, the quality of children’s school would be increased by 0.11 standard units. The research hypothesis 1 a in this article (the higher the <b>family</b> socioeconomic <b>status,</b> the higher the quality of the children’s school) is supported by the data. However, <b>family</b> socio-economic <b>status</b> does not explain the quality of children’s schooling to a large extent. The family background only explains the 1.2 % difference in the quality of children’s school. This shows that in the compulsory education stage, due to the restriction of the nearest admission principle, the influence of <b>family</b> socio-economic <b>status</b> on children’s quality of attending schools is relatively limited, and the difference in the quality of their schooling may be mainly due to factors other than the family, such as differences between urban and rural areas and regional differences. It should be noted that this may be related to our use of household-based survey data and insufficient measurement of school quality.|$|R
25|$|The Calliphoridae (commonly {{known as}} blow flies, blow-flies, carrion flies, bluebottles, greenbottles, or cluster flies) are {{a family of}} insects in the order Diptera, with 1,100 known species.

The family {{is known to be}} polyphyletic, but much remains disputed {{regarding}} proper treatment of the constituent taxa, some of which are occasionally accorded <b>family</b> <b>status</b> (e.g., Bengaliidae, Helicoboscidae, Polleniidae, and Rhiniidae).|$|E
25|$|Three genera {{have been}} {{transferred}} to Allium. Caloscordum Herb. (1844)., which is now more properly considered part of Allium, Both Herbert (1844) and Lindley (1847) had originally considered it a distinct genus, while others considered {{it as part of}} Nothoscordum.(Li 1996) Milula is embedded in Allium as a section. Garaventia is considered part of Tristagma. Muilla was included in the Allioideae by Dahlgren, but in tribe Brodiaeeae. That tribe was subsequently raised to <b>family</b> <b>status</b> as Themidaceae.|$|E
25|$|Scutellerids {{were first}} {{described}} by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in 1815. It belongs to the order Hemiptera (true bugs), under the suborder Heteroptera and infraorder Pentatomomorpha. They are classified under the superfamily Pentatomoidea. They were formerly classified as a subfamily of Pentatomidae by George Willis Kirkaldy in 1909. The earliest attempt to restore them to <b>family</b> <b>status</b> was in 1917 by Edward Payson Van Duzee. Most authorities today regard it as a valid family group.|$|E

25|$|About 1500 BCE, {{people in}} the region were turning copper into bronze, growing rice, and domesticating {{chickens}} and pigs; they were among the first {{people in the}} world to do so. By 500 BCE, iron-working settlements emerged in an area south of present-day Mandalay. Bronze-decorated coffins and burial sites filled with earthenware remains have been excavated. Archaeological evidence at Samon Valley south of Mandalay suggests rice growing settlements that traded with China between 500 BC and 200 CE. During the Iron Age, archaeological evidence also out of Samon Valley reveal changes in infant burial practices that were greatly influenced by India. These changes include burying infants in jars in which their size depict their <b>family</b> <b>status.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stó:lō {{society was}} {{organized}} into classes: the sí:yá:m (or upper classes), the ordinary people, and the slaves, who were usually captives taken from enemy tribes in raids or warfare. A person's <b>family</b> <b>status</b> {{was important in}} determining their role within Stó:lō society, and within Longhouse ceremonies, though this has faded over time. Slaves may have been treated relatively well, {{but they were not}} permitted to eat with others at the Longhouse fire. They were primarily responsible for daily tasks such as gathering nuts, fruits and other foods, or firewood. The use of slaves died out in the nineteenth century. In some bands, the memory of which families descend from slaves may persist.|$|E
25|$|Such wealth {{gave rise}} to social upheavals, which were {{for the most part}} harshly {{contained}} by the militia. In 1302, however, after the Bruges Matins (the nocturnal massacre of the French garrison in Bruges by the members of the local Flemish militia on 18 May 1302), the population joined forces with the Count of Flanders against the French, culminating in the victory at the Battle of the Golden Spurs, fought near Kortrijk on 11 July. The statue of Jan Breydel and Pieter de Coninck, the leaders of the uprising, can still be seen on the Big Market square. The city maintained a militia as a permanent paramilitary body. It gained flexibility and high prestige by close ties to a guild of organized militia, comprising professionals and specialized units. Militia men bought and maintained their own weapons and armour, according to their <b>family</b> <b>status</b> and wealth.|$|E
