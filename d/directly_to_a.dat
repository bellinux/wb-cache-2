5|$|During {{the period}} of Nazi occupation, some Belgians collaborated with their occupiers. There were pro-Nazi {{political}} organizations in both Flemish and Walloon communities {{before and during the}} war. The most significant were DeVlag, Verdinaso and Vlaams Nationaal Verbond (VNV) in Flanders as well as the Catholic Rex movement in Wallonia. Each of these movements had subtly different ideologies, their own paramilitary forces and printed their own newspapers. These organisations were also instrumental in encouraging Belgians to enlist into the German Army. Unlike the German-style National Socialist agenda of DeVlag, VNV appealed <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Flemish separatist agenda, though this message was never the main source of their popularity. Infighting between the groups, particularly VNV and DeVlag, was considerable.|$|E
5|$|Saccharolipids {{describe}} {{compounds in}} which fatty acids are linked <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sugar backbone, forming structures that {{are compatible with}} membrane bilayers. In the saccharolipids, a monosaccharide substitutes for the glycerol backbone present in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids. The most familiar saccharolipids are the acylated glucosamine precursors of the LipidA component of the lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria. Typical lipidA molecules are disaccharides of glucosamine, which are derivatized {{with as many as}} seven fatty-acyl chains. The minimal lipopolysaccharide required for growth in E. coli is Kdo2-Lipid A, a hexa-acylated disaccharide of glucosamine that is glycosylated with two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues.|$|E
5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{with minimal}} convection moved {{off the coast}} of Africa near Dakar between August 14 and August 15. It moved westward, and gradually developed thunderstorms across the wave axis. On August 21, while located about 450miles (725km) east of the Lesser Antilles, convection increased further within the system, though unfavorable upper-level wind shear prevented rapid development. It continued to become better organized, and though a Reconnaissance flight into the system reported strong winds, it lacked a surface circulation. Late on August 21 the wave passed through the northern Lesser Antilles, and subsequent to a decrease in wind shear the system became much better organized on August 22. A surface circulation formed, and the system developed into Tropical Storm Dean on August 22 near Saint Croix. Dean was upgraded <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm due to the presence of 50mph (80km/h) winds in the storm.|$|E

5|$|At this time, {{unhappy with}} the way his {{collection}} The Round Table, issued in the same year, was being promoted by its publisher, he began to promote his new book himself, partly {{by word of mouth}} and also by getting a friend to publish the chapter on Hamlet in The Times and requesting Francis Jeffrey, editor of the Edinburgh Review, to notice it in that periodical. He had already had it printed privately (instead of offering it <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> publisher) by his friend the printer Carew Henry Reynell, who purchased the copyright for £100. As a publicity tactic, copies were circulated privately. Finally, Hazlitt got the book published, by Rowland Hunter and the brothers Charles and James Ollier in collaboration, who brought it out on 9 July 1817. It was extremely successful, this first edition selling out in six weeks. A second edition was issued by Taylor and Hessey in 1818, and later that year an unlicensed edition was brought out in Boston by Wells and Lilly. No further editions appeared in Hazlitt's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|By June 1942, the Manhattan Project {{had reached}} the stage where the {{construction}} of production facilities could be contemplated. On June 25, 1942, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) S-1 Executive Committee deliberated on {{where they should be}} located. Moving <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> megawatt production plant looked like a big step, given that many industrial processes do not easily scale from the laboratory to production size. An intermediate step of building a pilot plant was considered prudent. For the pilot plutonium separation plant, a site was wanted close to the Metallurgical Laboratory, where the research was being carried out, but for reasons of safety and security, it was not desirable to locate the facilities in a densely populated area like Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Rega {{went against}} {{conventional}} {{wisdom of the}} time, preferring to make their decks lightweight and rigid {{as a means of}} controlling unwanted resonances. Their belief was that mass absorbs energy and results in lost music. In other senses, the turntables are deliberately minimalistic and neither require nor justify any 'tweaking' by users, except adjustment to the vertical-tracking-angle (VTA) of the cartridge. It is a belt-driven design incorporating a driving 'sub-platter' mounted on a high quality oil-lubricated bearing, which is fixed <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> medite (MDF) plinth supported by three simple rubber feet. A heavy glass platter sits atop the sub-platter, which is driven by a mechanically-isolated 24V synchronous motor through a rubber belt. A 2mm-thick mat sits on top of the glass platter. The turntable is without suspension, and the rubber feet provide limited mechanical isolation from floor-transmitted vibrations. A perspex cover is provided for some isolation against airborne vibrations. The record deck is single speed – it runs at 33 rpm, and the user must physically remove the platter to reposition the drive belt to play 45 rpm records.|$|E

5|$|The {{progenitors}} of Type Ib/c supernovae are {{not observed}} at all, and constraints on their possible luminosity are often {{lower than those}} of known WC stars. WO stars are extremely rare and visually relatively faint, so it is difficult to say whether such progenitors are missing or just yet to be observed. Very luminous progenitors have not been securely identified, despite numerous supernovae being observed near enough that such progenitors would have been clearly imaged. Population modelling shows that the observed Type Ib/c supernovae could be reproduced by a mixture of single massive stars and stripped-envelope stars from interacting binary systems. The continued lack of unambiguous detection of progenitors for normal Type Ib and Ic supernovae may be due to most massive stars collapsing <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> black hole without a supernova outburst. Most of these supernovae are then produced from lower-mass low-luminosity helium stars in binary systems. A small number would be from rapidly-rotating massive stars, likely corresponding to the highly-energetic Type Ic-BL events that are associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. Two pathways of cell-to-cell transmission have been reported. Firstly, an infected T cell can transmit virus <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> target T cell via a virological synapse. Secondly, an antigen presenting cell (APC) can also transmit HIV to T cells by a process that either involves productive infection (in the case of macrophages) or capture and transfer of virions in trans (in the case of dendritic cells). Whichever pathway is used, infection by cell-to-cell transfer {{is reported to be}} much more efficient than cell-free virus spread. A number of factors contribute to this increased efficiency, including polarised virus budding towards the site of cell-to-cell contact, close apposition of cells which minimizes fluid-phase diffusion of virions, and clustering of HIV entry receptors on the target cell to the contact zone. Cell-to-cell spread is thought to be particularly important in lymphoid tissues where CD4+ T lymphocytes are densely packed and likely to frequently interact. Intravital imaging studies have supported the concept of the HIV virological synapse in vivo. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} senior Bowie died circa 1820, he gave ten slaves {{as well as}} horses and cattle to both James and Rezin. For the next seven years, the {{brothers}} worked together to develop several large estates in Lafourche Parish and Opelousas. Louisiana's population was growing rapidly, and the brothers hoped {{to take advantage of}} its rising land prices through speculation. Without the capital required to buy large tracts, they entered into a partnership with pirate Jean Lafitte in 1818 to raise money. By then, the United States had outlawed the importation of slaves, and most southern states allowed anyone who informed on a slave trader to receive half of what the imported slaves would earn at auction as a reward. Bowie made three trips to Lafitte's compound on Galveston Island. On each occasion, he bought smuggled slaves and took them <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> customhouse to inform on his own actions. When the customs officers offered the slaves for auction, Bowie purchased them and received back half the price he had paid, as allowed by the state laws. He then could legally transport the slaves and resell them at a greater market value in New Orleans or areas farther up the Mississippi River. Using this scheme, the brothers collected $65,000 to be used for their land speculation.|$|E
