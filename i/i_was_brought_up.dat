25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up.</b> I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E

Dunstan later said of his involvement with the Liberals: [...] "I do not call it snobbery to deride the Establishment in South Australia, I admit that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> into it, and I admit that it gave me a pain."

Glenn is the name <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> with, Divine is the name I've been using for the past 23 years. I guess it's always Glenn and it's always Divine.

There's the Divine you're talking to now and there's the character Divine, which is just something I do to make a living. She doesn't really exist at all."

500|$|The song [...] "Cyprus Avenue" [...] is a three chord blues {{composition}} and served {{for many years}} as the closing song for most of Morrison's live shows. [...] Along with [...] "Madame George", it {{is the centerpiece of}} the album and both songs are Belfast related and highly impressionistic. [...] The song is told {{from the point of view}} of an outsider watching from inside an automobile and getting tongue-tied as the refined school girl he fantasizes about appears and he imagines her a fine lady with [...] "rainbow ribbons in her hair" [...] in a carriage drawn by six white horses and [...] "returning from a fair". Van Morrison described Cyprus Avenue as [...] "a street in Belfast, [...] a place where there's a lot of wealth. [...] It wasn't far from where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> and it was a very [...] different scene. [...] To me it was a very mystical place.

In an interview published in the Times newspaper in 2000 Sanger is quoted as saying: [...] "My father was a committed Quaker and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> as a Quaker, and for them truth is very important. I drifted away from those beliefs – one is obviously looking for truth, but one needs some evidence for it. Even if I wanted to believe in God I would find it very difficult.

2500|$|Though Pullman {{has stated}} he is [...] "a Church of England atheist, and a 1662 Book of Common Prayer atheist, because that’s the {{tradition}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> in”, {{he has also}} said he is technically an agnostic. He has singled out elements of Christianity for criticism: [...] "if there is a God, and he is as the Christians describe him, then he deserves to be put down and rebelled against." [...] However, {{he said that his}} argument can extend to all religions. Pullman has also referred to himself as knowingly [...] "of the Devil's party", a reference to William Blake's revisionist view of Milton in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. Pullman is a supporter of Humanists UK and an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society. [...] In 2011 he was given a services to Humanism award by the British Humanist Association for his contribution as a longstanding supporter.|$|E
2500|$|Stein's essay {{appeared}} in the February 1935 issue of The Lit with the title [...] "How Writing Is Written."

It [...] "occupies a unique place in Stein's corpus as a social text that carries the marks of its particular occasion ... direct address to her audience (around sixty boys, as well as faculty and some former students)." [...] Stein's two-day stay at Choate was her first exposure to a private school, if we can believe her statement in Everybody's Autobiography (published 1937). She wrote, [...] "It {{was the first time}} I had ever seen such a school. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> in East Oakland we all went to public school ...

2500|$|Wyatt {{was born}} in Bristol. [...] His mother was Honor Wyatt, a {{journalist}} with the BBC, and his father, George Ellidge, was an industrial psychologist. Wyatt had two half-brothers from his parents' previous marriages, Honor Wyatt's son, actor Julian Glover, and George Ellidge's son, press photographer Mark Ellidge. His parents' friends were [...] "quite bohemian", and his upbringing was [...] "unconventional". Wyatt said [...] "It seemed perfectly normal to me. My father didn't join us until I was six, and he died ten years later, having retired early with multiple sclerosis, so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> a lot by women." [...] Wyatt attended the Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys, Canterbury and as a teenager lived with his parents in Lydden near Dover, where he was taught drums by visiting American jazz drummer George Neidorf. It was during this period that Wyatt [...] met and became friends with expatriate Australian musician Daevid Allen, who rented a room in Wyatt's family home.|$|E

And he doesn't love me. He wasn't brought up the way you were brought up and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up,</b> through love of this country." [...] In response to criticism of the remarks, Giuliani said, [...] "Some people thought it was racist—I thought that was a joke, since he was brought up by a white mother... This isn't racism. This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism." [...] White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said he agreed with Giuliani [...] "that it was a horrible thing to say", but said he would leave it up to the people who heard Giuliani directly to assess if the remarks were appropriate for the event. Although he received some support for his controversial comments, Giuliani said he also received several death threats within 48 hours.|$|E
2500|$|One way or another, Nell's father {{seems to}} have been out of the picture by the time of her {{childhood}} in Covent Garden, and her [...] "dipsomaniac mother, [...] sister", Rose, were left in a low situation. She experimented with cross-dressing between 1663-1667 going under the name [...] "William Nell" [...] and adopting a false beard; her observations informed a most successful and hilarious character interpretation acting as a man on the stage in March 1667. Old Madam Gwyn was by most accounts an alcoholic whose business was running a bawdy house (or brothel). There, or in the bawdy house of one Madam Ross, Nell would spend at least some time. It is possible she worked herself as a child prostitute; Peter Thomson, in the Oxford Illustrated History of Theatre, says it is [...] "probable". A rare mention of her upbringing from the source herself might be seen to contradict the idea: A 1667 entry in Samuel Pepys' diary records, second-hand, thatHere Mrs. Pierce tells me [...] that Nelly and Beck Marshall, falling out the other day, the latter called the other my Lord Buckhurst's whore. Nell answered then, [...] "I was but one man's whore, though <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> in a bawdy-house to fill strong waters to the guests; and you are a whore to three or four, though a Presbyter's praying daughter!". However, it is not out of the question that Gwyn was merely echoing the satirists of the day, if she said this at all.|$|E

2500|$|Leonard Woolf {{wrote about}} Sackville-West, who, as an aristocrat, {{came from a}} very {{different}} world than {{he and his wife}} : [...] "She [...] belonged indeed to a world which was completely different from ours, and the long line of Sackvilles, Dorsets, Da La Warrs and Knole with its 365 rooms had put into her mind and heart an ingredient which was alien to us and at first made intimacy difficult". While Sackville-West was visiting Nicholson in Tehran, Woolf wrote to her: [...] "Then there's my character (you see how egoistical I am, for I only answer questions that are about myself), I agree with the lack of jolly vulgarity. But then think about how <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up!</b> No school, mooning about alone among my father's books, never a chance to pick up all that goes on in the schools-throwing balls: ragging: slang: vulgarity: scenes: jealousies: only rages with my half brothers and being walked off my legs round the Serpentine by my father". In her reply, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "But indeed, my upbringing wasn't so different from yours: I move about too, at Knole mostly, and haven't had a brother or sister to knock the corners off me. And I never went to school. If I am jolly and vulgar, you can cry quits on another count, for you have that interest in humanity which I can never manage-at least I have the interest, but not the diabolical skill in its practice which is yours. As I get older...I get more and more disagreeably solitary". Besides for having similar childhoods, both women had grown up with a profound sense of the weight of English history as Woolf's father Sir Leslie Stephen had been a leading contributor to The Dictionary of National Biography while Sackville-West had grown up at Knole House, one of the grand country houses of England. Likewise, Sackville-West had felt torn between her Spanish heritage which contrasted with the English grandeur she had been brought up in at Knole House while Woolf felt torn between the [...] "sobriety" [...] of her father's family vs. the [...] "flamboyance" [...] of her mother's family.|$|E
