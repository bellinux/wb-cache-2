50|$|Prymnesium parvum is {{a species}} of haptophytes (=Prymnesiophyta). The species is of concern because {{of its ability to}} produce a toxin, prymnesin. It is a flagellated alga that is {{normally}} found suspended in the water column. It was first identified in North America in 1985 and it is not known if it was introduced artificially (e.g., an invasive species or missed in previous surveys). Toxin production mainly kills fish and appears to have little effect on cattle or humans. This distinguishes it from red tide, which are algal bloom whose toxins lead to harmful effects in people. Although no harmful effects are known, it is recommended not to consume dead or dying fish exposed to a P. parvum bloom. Prymnesium parvum of Haptophyta is sometimes termed a golden alga or a <b>golden</b> <b>brown</b> <b>algae</b> as is Chrysophyceae of Heterokontophyta but the taxonomy of algae is under complex revision leading to contradictions in terms especially in non scholarly texts such as those from state wildlife departments.|$|E
40|$|Microalgae are {{a diverse}} group of organisms that form the basic {{component}} of many eco­- systems. The systemic classification of algae is primarily based on their pigment composition and is divided into nine classes. The largest groups are Chlorophyceae (green algae), Phaeophyceae (brown algae), Pyrrophyceae (dinoflagellates), Chrysophyceae (<b>golden</b> <b>brown</b> <b>algae),</b> Bacillariophyceae (diatoms) and Rhodo­ phyceae (red algae). It has been estimated that between 22, 000 and 26, 000 species exist (Norton et al., 1996), of which only a few species have been identified to be useful for commercial application, such as Spirulina, Chlorella, Haematococcus, Dunaliella, Botryococcus, Phaeodactylum and Porphyridium. Several other species that are also cultivated commercially for the hatcheries in the aquaculture field include Chaetoceros, Crypthecodinium, Isochrysis, Nannochloris, Nitzschia, Schizo­chytrium, Tetraselmis and Skeletonema (Raja et al., 2008) ...|$|E
40|$|Heterosigma akashiwo virus (HaV) {{is a large}} {{double-stranded}} DNA virus infecting the single-cell bloom-forming raphidophyte (<b>golden</b> <b>brown</b> <b>alga)</b> H. akashiwo. A molecular phylogenetic {{sequence analysis}} of HaV DNA polymerase showed that it forms a sister group with Phycodnaviridae algal viruses. All 10 examined HaV strains, which had distinct intraspecies host specificities, included an intein (protein intron) in their DNA polymerase genes. The 232 -amino-acid inteins differed from each other {{by no more than}} a single nucleotide change. All inteins were present at the same conserved position, coding for an active-site motif, which also includes inteins in mimivirus (a very large double-stranded DNA virus of amoebae) and in several archaeal DNA polymerase genes. The HaV intein is closely related to the mimivirus intein, and both are apparently monophyletic to the archaeal inteins. These observations suggest the occurrence of horizontal transfers of inteins between viruses of different families and between archaea and viruses and reveal that viruses might be reservoirs and intermediates in horizontal transmissions of inteins. The homing endonuclease domain of the HaV intein alleles is mostly deleted. The mechanism keeping their sequences basically identical in HaV strains specific for different hosts is yet unknown. One possibility is that rapid and local changes in the HaV genome change its host specificity. This is the first report of inteins found in viruses infecting eukaryotic algae...|$|R
50|$|The axopods are {{supported}} by microtubules arranged in a unique and characteristic double-coil pattern. In Actinophrys, these arise from the nuclear membrane, while in Actinosphaerium some do and others don't. Other heliozoa where the microtubules arise from the nucleus have been considered possible relatives, and {{it now appears that}} the actinophryids developed from axodines such as Pedinella. These are specialized heterokont algae, related to <b>golden</b> <b>algae,</b> diatoms, <b>brown</b> <b>algae,</b> and the like, which have microtubule-supported tentacles.|$|R

But, a significant number of them are also known for their nuisance value on account of their ability to produce potentially lethal toxins. The population density of Microcystis aeruginosa accounts for bloom like situation in fish culture ponds. The population density of M. aeruginosa was found to be maximum in HP, followed by DP and MP. Bloom like situation was recorded during summer and was observed only when its population density was> 2. 5 x 10 4 cells/cm 3. Ochromonas danica, a <b>golden</b> <b>brown</b> Chrysophytean <b>alga</b> engulfs and digests Microcystis aeruginosa colonies, a situation observed during survey of MP, when water sample was examined microscopically.

40|$|Green {{autofluorescence}} (GAF) {{has been}} described in the short flagellum of <b>golden</b> and <b>brown</b> <b>algae,</b> the stigma of Euglenophyceae, and cytoplasm of different life stages of dinoflagellates and is considered by some researchers a valuable taxonomic feature for dinoflagellates. In addition, green fluorescence staining has been widely proposed or adopted to measure cell viability (or physiological state) {{in areas such as}} apoptosis of phytoplankton, pollutant stresses on algae, metabolic activity of algae, and testing treatment technologies for ships' ballast water. This paper reports our epifluorescence microscopic observations and quantitative spectrometric measurements of GAF in a broad phylogenetic range of microalgae. Our results demonstrate GAF is a common feature of dinoflagellates, diatoms, green algae, cyanobacteria, and raphidophytes, occurs in the cytoplasm and particularly in eyespots, accumulation bodies, spines, and aerotopes, and is caused by molecules other than chlorophyll. GAF intensity increased with time after cell death or fixation and with excitation by blue or UV light and was affected by pH. GAF of microalgae may be only of limited value in taxonomy. It can be strong enough to interfere with the results of green fluorescence staining, particularly when stained samples are observed microscopically. GAF is useful, however, for microscopic study of algal morphology, especially to visualize cellular components such as eyespots, nucleus, aerotopes, spines, and chloroplasts. Furthermore, GAF can be used to visualize and enumerate dinoflagellate cysts in marine and estuarine sediments in the context of anticipating and monitoring harmful algal blooms and in tracking potentially harmful dinoflagellates transported in ships' ballast tanks...|$|R

50|$|The closest {{relatives}} of the <b>brown</b> <b>algae</b> include unicellular and filamentous species, but no unicellular species of <b>brown</b> <b>algae</b> are known. However, most scientists assume that the Phaeophyceae evolved from unicellular ancestors.

50|$|Most <b>brown</b> <b>algae,</b> {{with the}} {{exception}} of the Fucales, perform sexual reproduction through sporic meiosis. Between generations, the algae go through separate sporophyte (diploid) and gametophyte (haploid) phases. The sporophyte stage is often the more visible of the two, though some species of <b>brown</b> <b>algae</b> have similar diploid and haploid phases. Free floating forms of <b>brown</b> <b>algae</b> often do not undergo sexual reproduction until they attach themselves to substrate. The haploid generation consists of male and female gametophytes. The fertilization of egg cells varies between species of <b>brown</b> <b>algae,</b> and may be isogamous, oogamous, or anisogamous. Fertilization may take place in the water with eggs and motile sperm, or within the oogonium itself.|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} of <b>Brown</b> <b>algae</b> occurs {{with the help}} of pheromones, chemical messengers involved in mating coordination. They are released by female gametes in order to attract and/or induce release of male conspecifics. These substances have been identified as olefines with linear or cyclic structure, composed mostly of eleven carbon atoms (C 11 hydrocarbons), which are biosynthesised from C 20 polyunsaturated fatty acids (C 20 PUFAs). Some species of <b>brown</b> <b>algae</b> release cis-bisalkenylcyclopropane hydrocarbons as enantiopure compounds, which spontaneously rearrange to substituted cycloheptadienes. Other species of <b>brown</b> <b>algae</b> and certain diatoms, produce trans-bisalkenylcyclopropanes as defined enantiomeric mixtures. These diatoms simultaneously oxidise the C 20 PUFA precursor. Aim of the project was to elucidate the stereochemical course of pheromone biosynthesis and the putative oxygenation of the fatty acid in a <b>brown</b> <b>alga</b> which produces an enantiomerically pure pheromone.
