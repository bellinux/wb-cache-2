5|$|During operations, the He 111Z did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> {{power to}} lift a fully loaded Me 321. Some He 111s were {{supplemented}} by rocket pods for extra takeoff thrust, {{but this was not}} a fleet-wide action. Two rockets were mounted beneath each fuselage and one underneath each wing. This added 500kg (1,100lb) in weight. The pods were then released by parachute after takeoff.|$|E

5|$|However, the U.S. did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> troops; Cutler, whose brigade was {{deployed}} {{north of}} the Chambersburg Pike, had his right flank in the air. The leftmost division of the XI Corps was unable to deploy in time to strengthen the line, so Doubleday was forced to throw in reserve brigades to salvage his line.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{the sons}} of Frederick Law Olmsted, {{landscape}} architect for Central Park in New York, Carey and Frederick, Jr. were asked to design the park's master plan while they were at work on Grant Park.

5|$|According to Nathan Fillion, {{there was}} an episode in which the crew land on a dying planet. The {{inhabitants}} try to steal Serenity, after they explain to the crew about their need {{to get off the}} planet. The problem is that unless they were to run into another ship along the way, with the extra passengers, Serenity would not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> fuel and oxygen {{to make it to the}} closest destination. While everyone else is asleep, Mal takes the ship himself and discovers that help never would have arrived.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the band}} did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> time to sell any records while touring, the album became Metal Blade Records' highest selling release. Five {{thousand}} copies was the label's average. Show No Mercy {{went on to}} sell between 15,500 and 20,000 copies in the United States; it also went on to sell more than 15,000 overseas, as Metal Blade had worldwide rights. The success of the album led to Slagel wanting the band to release a new record and an extended play.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{approached}} Sony in late 1989 {{because it}} did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> engineers to handle the number of new products that were planned for delivery in 1991. Using a basic blueprint from Apple, including a list of chips and other components, and the Portable's architecture, the 100 was miniaturized and manufactured by Sony in San Diego, California, and Japan. Sony engineers had little experience building personal computers but nonetheless completed Apple's smallest and lightest machine in under 13months, cancelling other projects and giving the PowerBook100 top priority. Sony president Norio Ohga gave project manager Kihey Yamamoto permission to recruit engineers from any Sony division.|$|E

He planned to pull his men back just before dusk, when they would <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> light to escape through the woods. Bouck ordered his men to remove the distributor caps from their Jeeps and to prepare to evacuate to the rear. He dispatched Corporal Sam Jenkins and PFC Preston through the woods to locate Major Kriz at Regimental HQ and seek instructions or reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Following its release, Most Wanted {{received}} mostly negative {{reviews from}} critics, who deemed the release as premature, stating that Duff did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> material {{to warrant a}} compilation. However, the Dead Executives-produced tracks received favorable comments; critics wrote that they stood out {{from the rest of}} the album. In the United States, the album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, becoming Duff's second number one album there. It was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Elsewhere, it debuted at number one in Canada, and reached the top ten in Australia, Ireland, Italy, Japan and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Having {{achieved}} {{stability in}} the West, Alexios could turn {{his attention to the}} severe economic difficulties and the disintegration of the Empire's traditional defences. However, he still did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> manpower to recover the lost territories in Asia Minor and to advance against the Seljuks. At the Council of Piacenza in 1095, envoys from Alexios spoke to Pope Urban II about the suffering of the Christians of the East, and underscored that without help from the West they would continue to suffer under Muslim rule.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{before going}} to the Archives in autumn 2006, Farrar invited his Gob Iron {{collaborator}} Anders Parker to come with him and look over potential material and the two returned several times over a period of months gathering lyrics for composition before recording together starting on July 14, 2007. As they found lyrics that interested them, they had reproductions mailed to their homes from the Archives to work on the material at their leisure. The duo finished recording several songs throughout the year but did not <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> material to complete the album. The recordings were also made without a budget or record contract for release.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 Stanley Marcus {{recommended}} {{to the board}} of directors that the company merge with Broadway-Hale of California in order to <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> capital to expand.

He retired as Chairman Emeritus in 1975, turning over the store to his son, Richard C. Marcus.|$|E

Plath took a job as a receptionist in the psychiatric unit of Massachusetts General Hospital and in the evening sat in on creative writing seminars given by poet Robert Lowell (also attended by the writers Anne Sexton and George Starbuck).|$|E
