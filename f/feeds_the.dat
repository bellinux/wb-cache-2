5|$|Most crickets {{lay their}} eggs in the soil or inside the stems of plants, and to do this, female crickets have a long, {{needle-like}} or sabre-like egg-laying organ called an ovipositor. Some ground-dwelling species have dispensed with this, either depositing their eggs in an underground chamber or pushing them into {{the wall of a}} burrow. The short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus) excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area, lays its eggs in a pile on a chamber floor, and after the eggs have hatched, <b>feeds</b> <b>the</b> juveniles for about a month.|$|E
5|$|The Bradley brook joins on {{the right}} bank at Hambrook just before the river passes {{underneath}} the M4 motorway. After passing under the A4174 the Frome enters a more urban environment passing between Frenchay {{on the right}} and Bromley Heath and Downend on the left. Turning in a more south westerly direction the river enters Oldbury Court estate, a city park also known as Vassal's, past Snuff Mills, entering a steep valley at Stapleton, then passing Eastville park, where it <b>feeds</b> <b>the</b> former boating lake and is met by the Fishponds brook on the right.|$|E
5|$|The altricial, downy chicks hatch after 33days of incubation.

5|$|After {{passing through}} El Dorado, the Kansas Turnpike crosses the northernmost arms of El Dorado Lake. This marks the turnpike's {{entry into the}} Flint Hills, a band of hills in eastern Kansas. The turnpike does not leave this region {{completely}} until it reaches Topeka. As the highway continues northeast past El Dorado Lake, it runs roughly parallel to the Walnut River to the west, which <b>feeds</b> <b>the</b> reservoir, and K-177 to the east. Northwest {{of the town of}} Cassoday, K-177 finally crosses the turnpike, with Exit 92 (Cassoday), a diamond interchange, providing a connector to the state highway. The interchange was not present when the turnpike opened in 1956, but was built soon after as an east-facing folded diamond with two separate toll plazas. The present configuration was built c. 1995. Near this interchange, the turnpike crosses the Walnut River.|$|E

When Bigwig is nearly killed in a snare, the group realize that the new warren is managed by a farmer who protects and <b>feeds</b> <b>the</b> rabbits, but also harvests a number of them for their meat and skins. The residents of the new warren are simply using Hazel and the others to increase their own odds of survival. Fiver {{and the rest of the}} group work together to rescue Bigwig from a snare, then continue on their journey, along with a rabbit from the new warren called Strawberry, who asks to join them after his doe is killed in a snare.|$|E
5|$|The {{protoplanetary disk}} is an {{accretion}} disk that <b>feeds</b> <b>the</b> central star. Initially very hot, the disk later cools {{in what is}} known as the T tauri star stage; here, formation of small dust grains made of rocks and ice is possible. The grains eventually may coagulate into kilometer-sized planetesimals. If the disk is massive enough, the runaway accretions begin, resulting in the rapid—100,000 to 300,000years—formation of Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Near the star, the planetary embryos go through a stage of violent mergers, producing a few terrestrial planets. The last stage takes approximately 100million to a billion years.|$|E

5|$|A human {{going into}} an ala’s house, which is {{frequently}} {{deep in a}} forest, but may also be in the clouds, in a lake, spring, cave, gigantic tree, or other hidden remote place, or on an inhospitable mountain, can have varied consequences. If he approaches the ala with an appeal, and does not mention the differences between her and humans, he will be rewarded. Otherwise, he will be cruelly punished. According to one story, a stepdaughter, driven away from home by her stepmother, comes to an ala’s house; addresses her with the word mother; picks lice from the ala’s hair full of worms; and <b>feeds</b> <b>the</b> ala’s “livestock” of owls, wolves, badgers, and other wild animals; behaving and talking as if these things are quite normal to her, and is rewarded by the ala with a chest filled with gold. When the stepmother’s daughter comes to the ala’s house, she does the opposite, and the ala punishes her and her mother by sending them a chest of snakes, which blind them. In another example, when a prince asks an ala for her daughter’s hand, she saves him from other ale, and helps him get married. But when a girl to whom an ala is the godmother visits the ala with her mother, the ala eats them both because the mother talked about the strange things in her house.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} {{the promotional}} period, Burger King {{received}} numerous complaints from fans of Chicken Fries through social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. One of the major ways the company responded was through personalized responses to these posts. Instead of using an automated response that would paste a standardized message on people's Twitter <b>feeds,</b> <b>the</b> company instead employed several staff to personally respond to customers voicing displeasure on the LTO nature of the 2014 introduction. The entire 2014 Chicken Fries promotion represented a major shift in the attitude towards advertising for Burger King, moving from a more traditional advertising structure to one focused almost entirely on digitally-based media. This change happened fairly quickly, falling into place over the twelve to eighteen-month period preceding the reintroduction of Chicken Fries to the chain's menu. Along with the new advertising firm, a new director of digital marketing and social media was newly hired from cosmetics firm L'Oréal was added, increasing the clout of the digital advertising team within the chain.|$|E

5|$|Incubation {{has been}} {{recorded}} as averaging around 17 days. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial; they are born blind and naked, and start to develop down on their heads on day two. Their eyes open around day six, and they begin developing their primary flight feathers around day nine or ten. For {{the first three days}} after hatching, the mother <b>feeds</b> <b>the</b> nestlings alone, with food brought to her by the father. The father feeds them directly from the fourth day onwards, with the mother brooding them afterwards until day seven. Flies, butterflies, moths, caterpillars and beetles predominate in the food fed to the young birds. Flame robins fed a higher proportion of flying insects to their young at Nimmitabel than did scarlet robins, which may have been due to their later start to breeding. Both parents participate in removing faecal sacs from the nest. Parents have been observed feeding young up to five weeks after leaving the nest.|$|E
5|$|Most of the bivalve larvae that hatch from eggs in {{the water}} column feed on diatoms or other phytoplankton. In {{temperate}} regions, about 25% of species are lecithotrophic, depending on nutrients stored in the yolk of the egg where the main energy source is lipids. The longer the period is before the larva first <b>feeds,</b> <b>the</b> larger the egg and yolk need to be. The reproductive cost of producing these energy-rich eggs is high and they are usually smaller in number. For example, the Baltic tellin (Macoma balthica) produces few, high-energy eggs. The larvae hatching out of these rely on the energy reserves and do not feed. After about four days, they become D-stage larvae, when they first develop hinged, D-shaped valves. These larvae have a relatively small dispersal potential before settling out. The common mussel (Mytilus edulis) produces 10 times as many eggs that hatch into larvae and soon need to feed to survive and grow. They can disperse more widely as they remain planktonic for a much longer time.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the return}} flows do not issue {{directly}} back into the Snake River, but rather feed the Snake River Aquifer underneath the Snake River Plain. Water diverted from the river for irrigation, after absorbing any surface pollutants, re-enters the ground and <b>feeds</b> <b>the</b> aquifer. Although the aquifer has maintained its level, {{it has become increasingly}} laced with contaminants. Water in the aquifer eventually travels to {{the west side of the}} Snake River Plain and re-enters the river as springs. Throughout much of the Snake River Plain and Hells Canyon, excessive sediment is also a recurring problem. In December 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a permit requiring owners of fish farms along the Snake River to reduce their phosphorus discharge by 40%. Pollutant levels in Hells Canyon upstream of the Salmon River confluence, including that of water temperature, dissolved nutrients, and sediment, are required to meet certain levels.|$|E

5|$|The clutch is two {{to seven}} (normally five or six) cream-coloured eggs which have tiny ruddy, purple or blackish spots and are about 1.5centimetres (0.6in) long and 1.2centimetres (0.5in) across. They are {{incubated}} by the female for 13–14 days before hatching as naked, blind altricial chicks. The female broods and <b>feeds</b> <b>the</b> chicks for another 14–15 days until they fledge. The male rarely participates in feeding, although this sometimes occurs, especially when bad weather limits insect supplies {{or if the}} female disappears. After fledging, the young stay {{in the vicinity of}} the nest for three to four weeks, and are fed by and roost with the female, although these interactions reduce after approximately the first 14 days. In the north of the range there is only time to raise one brood, due to the short summer, but a second brood is common in central and southern areas.|$|E
5|$|The female kakapo lays 1 or 2 eggs (rarely 3) per {{breeding}} cycle, {{with long}} intervals between laying of {{first and second}} eggs. She nests on the ground {{under the cover of}} plants or in cavities such as hollow tree trunks. The female incubates the eggs faithfully, but is forced to leave them every night in search of food. Predators are known to eat the eggs and the embryos inside can also die of cold in the mother's absence. Kakapo eggs usually hatch within 30days, bearing fluffy grey chicks that are quite helpless. After the eggs hatch, the female <b>feeds</b> <b>the</b> chicks for three months, and the chicks remain with the female for some months after fledging. The young chicks are just as vulnerable to predators as the eggs, and young have been killed by many of the same predators that attack adults. Chicks leave the nest at approximately 10 to 12weeks of age. As they gain greater independence, their mothers may feed the chicks sporadically for up to 6months.|$|E
5|$|Under certain {{circumstances}} the disk, which {{can now be}} called protoplanetary, may {{give birth to a}} planetary system. Protoplanetary disks have been observed around a very high fraction of stars in young star clusters. They exist from the beginning of a star's formation, but at the earliest stages are unobservable due to the opacity of the surrounding envelope. The disk of a Class0 protostar is thought to be massive and hot. It is an accretion disk, which <b>feeds</b> <b>the</b> central protostar. The temperature can easily exceed 400K inside 5AU and 1,000K inside 1AU. The heating of the disk is primarily caused by the viscous dissipation of turbulence in it and by the infall of the gas from the nebula. The high temperature in the inner disk causes most of the volatile material—water, organics, and some rocks to evaporate, leaving only the most refractory elements like iron. The ice can survive only in the outer part of the disk.|$|E

5|$|As the Enterprise arrives, {{the crew}} members explore the offerings of Farpoint Station and {{establish}} relations with their Bandi host, Groppler Zorn (Michael Bell). The crew becomes suspicious when items they desire seem to appear out of nowhere moments later, and are unable to identify the power source that <b>feeds</b> <b>the</b> station. Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis), an empath, senses a being with powerful yet despairing emotions nearby, and the crew discover a strange labyrinth beneath the station, but Zorn does not offer an explanation. As the Enterprise crew continues its explorations, a large unknown alien craft enters orbit and begins to fire upon an older Bandi settlement near Farpoint Station, and abducts Zorn. Before Picard orders the ship's phasers to be fired at the craft, Q appears {{to remind him of}} humanity's trial and prompts Picard to send an away team to the alien craft. The away team discovers the craft has passages similar to those under Farpoint and they are able to free Zorn. Their actions cause the alien craft to transform into a jellyfish-like space creature, and Picard is able to deduce the mystery of Farpoint Station. He confirms with the apologetic Zorn that the Bandi found a similar lifeform injured on their planet and, while attempting to care for it, they also exploited its ability to synthesize matter to create Farpoint Station. The creature now in orbit is trying to help free its mate by attacking those who hold it captive.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle usually chooses {{tall trees}} or {{man-made}} pylons to nest in. Often, locations are sought {{where there is}} a tall dead tree or high branch with good visibility which {{can be used as a}} perch to survey the surrounding area, which is generally a low-lying locale near water with some forest cover. The perch becomes covered in faeces and pellets and animal remains litter the immediate surrounding area. The nest is a large deep bowl constructed of sticks and branches, and lined with such materials as grass or seaweed. Yearly renovations result in nests getting gradually bigger. Nests are generally sited in the forks of large trees overlooking bodies of water. Old nests of wedge-tailed eagles or whistling kites have been renovated and used. Cliffs are also suitable nesting sites, and on islands nests are sometimes built directly on the ground. A breeding pair, with the male being more active, spends three to six weeks building or renovating the nest before laying eggs. Normally a clutch of two dull, white, oval eggs are laid. Measuring 73×55mm, they are incubated over six weeks before hatching. The young are semi-altricial, and covered in white down when they emerge from the egg. Initially, the male brings food and the female <b>feeds</b> <b>the</b> chicks, but both parents feed the chicks as they grow larger. Although two eggs are laid, it is unusual for two young to be reared successfully to fledging (leaving the nest). One egg may be infertile, or the second chick may die in the nest. If the first clutch is lost, the parents may attempt a second brood. Nestlings have been recorded fledging when 70 to 80 days old, and remaining around the parents' territory for up to six months or until the following breeding season.|$|E
