5|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>making</b> {{just one}} goalless {{appearance}} as England failed to progress past the Euro 1992 group stages, Shearer was soon subject to an English transfer record-breaking £3.6million bid from Blackburn Rovers. Although {{there was also}} interest from Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, Blackburn benefactor Jack Walker's millions were enough to prise the striker from the Saints, and Shearer moved north to Ewood Park {{in the middle of}} 1992.|$|E
5|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>making</b> two {{separate}} landfalls in Atlantic Canada on September2 and September3, the hurricane caused minimal damage. Effects in Nova Scotia {{were limited to}} boating incidents. In Lake Milo, near Yarmouth, six yachts capsized due to the strong winds. In New Brunswick, damage was also minimal. A car accident associated with the storm injured a man near Barnesville.|$|E
5|$|In April 2014, Izvestia {{reported}} that Tasci could be leaving Spartak Moscow, leading to interest from Turkish sides Fenerbahçe and Beşiktaş. <b>Despite</b> <b>making</b> four appearances during the 2013–14 season, Tasci {{said he was}} learning Russian, though he communicates well in German with his teammates Lucas Barrios, José Manuel Jurado and Patrick Ebert. He could also communicate in Turkish with his new manager Murat Yakin.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United {{qualified}} for the 2003 FA Community Shield by winning the Premier League – their eighth championship in 11 years. <b>Despite</b> <b>making</b> their worst start to a league campaign since the 1989–90 season, the team finished five points clear of second-placed Arsenal, the pre-season favourites. Arsenal's campaign was compensated by an appearance in the 2003 FA Cup Final; the team beat Southampton 1–0 to retain the trophy and qualify for the Community Shield.|$|E
5|$|To {{help him}} out, Bart gets Buck {{a job on}} Krusty the Clown's show, but Buck gets drunk and makes a fool of himself on air, {{crushing}} Bart. Seeing this, Marge and Homer decide to help Buck overcome his alcoholism, so they clean out Buck's house and enroll him in an Alcoholics Anonymous program. <b>Despite</b> <b>making</b> progress, Buck is not restored to hero-status for Bart.|$|E
5|$|Brown thus gained {{selection}} for the First Test, batting {{out of position}} in the middle order while Sid Barnes and Morris opened, whereas Harvey was dropped <b>despite</b> <b>making</b> a century in Australia's most recent Test against India. This was the exact situation that had unfolded in the Worcestershire and MCC matches when Australia fielded their first-choice team; Harvey did not play and Brown batted out of position in the middle order. There was a chance of Harvey receiving a last-minute call-up when Barnes was ill with food poisoning in the week {{leading up to the}} Test, but the opener recovered.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea centre back Frank Sinclair {{and left}} back Graeme Le Saux were both sidelined {{for the final}} due to their calf injuries, causing player-manager Vialli to swap them with Michael Duberry, and Danny Granville, who had {{recovered}} from an abscess pain. Central midfielder Poyet was {{also included in the}} starting line-up to join captain Dennis Wise, after returning from a damaged cruciate ligament. Together with forward and lead goalscorer Vialli, Flo began in the attack, instead of Zola, who was named as a substitute, <b>despite</b> <b>making</b> an improvement from his damaged groin, sustained in a league fixture against Liverpool in April.|$|E
5|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>making</b> eight {{changes to}} the {{starting}} eleven Norwich started their League Cup campaign brightly with an entertaining 6–3 win at home to Bury with Johan Elmander scoring two of the six goals. The third round of the cup saw Norwich win away at Watford 3–2. Norwich were two goals down on 55 minutes but a goal from Josh Murphy, who was making his professional début, on 77 minutes inspired an extra time comeback. Chris Hughton again made eight changes for the fifth round of the cup which saw Norwich travel to Manchester United where two late goals resulted in a one-sided looking 4–0 defeat.|$|E
5|$|For {{the home}} Ashes series of 195051 Tallon was fit {{once more and}} {{available}} for national selection. <b>Despite</b> <b>making</b> only 37 runs in four innings in the lead-up matches, Tallon was chosen for all five Tests. He had a poor time with the bat, making only 39runs {{at an average of}} just 6.50. He took only eight catches, but kept tidily to retain his place in the team. His performances for Queensland were hardly more productive; he scored 161 runs at 16.10 and aside from a rain-affected draw, his state lost their remaining six matches.|$|E

5|$|Harvey was {{overlooked}} for Queensland {{selection for}} the whole 195253 season. He was recalled {{at the start of}} the 195354 campaign and made 26 and 20 in the first match against New South Wales, failing to convert his starts into big scores. He was retained <b>despite</b> <b>making</b> 15 and 0 in the next match against Victoria, but scored only 1 in the first innings of the match against South Australia starting on Christmas Day. Victoria were set 329 for victory, and having made only 62 runs in five innings for the season so far, he was the mainstay of the innings, scoring 102, but his team were all out for 245.|$|E
5|$|He struck 77 in the rain-affected drawn Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground and {{followed}} this with 56 in the Fourth Test in Adelaide. <b>Despite</b> <b>making</b> a duck in the Fifth Test, he ended the series {{as the second}} highest runscorer with 282 at 56.40 as Australia took the series 4–0. He bowled two overs without success. Outside the Tests, O'Neill scored 155 and 128 against Victoria and Western Australia respectively as New South Wales completed their sixth successive Sheffield Shield win.|$|E
5|$|He {{was unable}} to reclaim his Test place in 195253 <b>despite</b> <b>making</b> 133 against the touring South Africans and 84 against New South Wales for Queensland before the Tests. Tallon totalled 508 runs at 33.87 for the season and made 33 {{dismissals}} in eight matches, including seven in one fixture against Western Australia, but failed to taste victory in a single Queensland match. His omission angered Queensland fans, who relentlessly heckled the Australians during the First Test against the tourists in Brisbane, making fun of the mistakes made by Tallon's replacement Gil Langley in particular.|$|E
50|$|<b>Despite</b> not <b>making</b> his {{professional}} debut at this point, Gomes {{was selected by}} Stephen Constantine for the India U23 side that would {{take part in the}} 2016 AFC U23 qualifiers.|$|R

5|$|Making {{four more}} first-team {{appearances}} {{in place of}} injured regulars, Wark ended the season still on the youth team, and experienced success in {{the final of the}} FA Youth Cup, defeating West Ham United 5–1. He spent much of the 1975–76 season playing for the reserves, and was presented with the club's Young Player of the Year award, <b>despite</b> <b>making</b> just four appearances for the senior team. Moving into midfield, Wark made over 30 appearances in the 1976–77 season, scoring his first goals for the club, (10, in all) taking over penalty kicking duty; he also received his first red card.|$|E
5|$|On 19 September 2012 {{he joined}} Grimsby Town on a three-month loan deal. Towards {{the end of}} his stay at Blundell Park, Grimsby manager Paul Hurst {{admitted}} his desire to sign Neilson on a permanent deal following an impressive loan spell. Following his final game for the club, a 1–0 victory over promotion rivals Wrexham which put Grimsby on top of the table, Hurst admitted that it was unlikely that Neilson would be returning to Grimsby <b>despite</b> <b>making</b> him a good offer. Neilson departed Grimsby on 21 December 2012 having played ten league games, scoring a single goal.|$|E
5|$|As a {{developing}} typhoon, the outer rainbands of Saomai affected the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam, causing moderate damage. Localized power outages were reported, and damage totaled to US$650,000. Even before Saomai made landfall on Okinawa, the typhoon caused rough seas {{off the coast}} of Japan that resulted in several shipping incidents. Concurrently, the approach of a front into the country interacted with the typhoon, resulting in unprecedented rainfalls in Japan. Due to the floods, approximately 400,000people were evacuated in three prefectures. In Nagoya, observed rainfall totals were the highest since records began in 1891. <b>Despite</b> <b>making</b> landfall on Okinawa, damage was not as severe, though several landslides and strong winds were reported. Overall, damage in Japan and its outlying islands totaled JP¥24.8billion (US$223million) and eleven fatalities were reported. As Saomai tracked near China, its outer rainbands and strong waves prompted the evacuation of 20,000people and caused record high stream heights.|$|E

5|$|At the Welsh Open, O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Ricky Walden 4–1 in {{the last}} 16, John Higgins 5–1 in the quarter-finals, and Barry Hawkins 6–2 in the semi-finals. He defeated Ding Junhui 9–3 in the final to win his third Welsh Open title, and the 26th ranking title of his career. In the last frame of the final, he compiled a record 12th maximum break in professional competition, breaking the previous record of 11 maximum breaks that he had held jointly with Stephen Hendry. During the season O'Sullivan competed at the Players Tour Championship, and finished second on the European Tour Order of Merit, {{to qualify for the}} Players Championship Grand Final. There he defeated Scott Donaldson 4–0 {{in the last}} 32, but lost 3–4 against Yu Delu in the last 16, <b>despite</b> <b>making</b> a 140, the highest break of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of friends in the anti-slavery movement, Coffin moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1847 to operate a {{warehouse}} that sold only free-labor goods. <b>Despite</b> <b>making</b> considerable progress with the business, the free-labor venture proved unprofitable and he abandoned the enterprise in 1857. From 1847 through 1857, Coffin continued to assist hundreds of runaway slaves by lodging them in his Ohio home. When slavery was abolished after the American Civil War, Coffin traveled around the Midwest and overseas to France and Great Britain, where he was instrumental in forming aid societies that provided food, clothing, funds, and education to former slaves. Coffin retired from public life in the 1870s and wrote an autobiography, Reminiscences of Levi Coffin, published in 1876, a year before his death.|$|E
5|$|Burns {{had more}} first team {{opportunities}} during the 1993 season, {{due to a}} series of hand injuries to the first-choice wicket-keeper, Keith Piper. Burns' chances came particularly in one-day cricket; he appeared in eleven List A matches during the year. He scored 151 runs across nine batting innings at an average of 25.16, and reached his highest score of the season, 48 not out, against the touring Zimbabweans in September. <b>Despite</b> <b>making</b> another large century for the second team, scoring 172 against Yorkshire seconds, he struggled in first-class cricket; in six appearances he averaged just 9.60 for his 96 runs. The following year, his only first-class match was against Oxford University, with Piper ever-present in the County Championship. Burns continued to be selected as a wicket-keeper batsman in one-day cricket, though he was less successful than the previous year, scoring 86 runs at 10.75.|$|E
