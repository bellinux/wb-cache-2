[...] Satin himself {{turned out to be}} one of the newsletter's critics. [...] "I could have edited New Options forever", he wrote in 2004. [...] "But, increasingly, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> dissatisfied with my hyper-idealistic politics". [...] His experiences in the U.S. Green politics movement contributed to that dissatisfaction.|$|E
500|$|After being heavily {{recruited}} by several colleges around the country, Solo attended the University of Washington from 1999 to 2002 where she majored in speech communications. With the Huskies, she switched permanently to goalkeeper under {{the lead of}} head coach Lesle Gallimore and goalkeeper coach and former national team player, Amy Griffin. Solo described the transition in her memoir, [...] "In high school, I had been the forward who won games. It was a huge mental adjustment to learn that {{my job was to}} save games. To anticipate what was needed. Before, I would stand in goal, the ball would come toward me, and I'd use my athletic ability to make the save. But thanks to Amy's tutelage and my time with the national team, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> a much better tactical goalkeeper. I learned how to read my opponents' runs toward goal, how to position my defenders, how to see the angles... The intellectual side also made goalkeeping so much more interesting. It wasn't just ninety minutes of waiting for my defense to make a mistake. It was ninety minutes of tactics and strategy. The personality traits that had been shaped by my childhood—resilience and toughness—were assets at the position." ...|$|E
2500|$|During a Playboy {{interview}} in 1992, Williams {{was asked whether}} he ever feared losing his balance between his work and his life. He replied, [...] "There's that fear—if I felt like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> not just dull but a rock, that I still couldn't speak, fire off or talk about things, if I'd start to worry or got too afraid to say something ... If I stop trying, I get afraid." [...] While he attributed the recent suicide of novelist Jerzy Kosiński to his fear of losing his creativity and sharpness, Williams felt he could overcome those risks. For that, he credited his father for strengthening his self-confidence, telling him to never be afraid of talking about subjects which were important to him.|$|E

2500|$|As World War <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> more {{widespread}} in its ramifications, the Bahá'ís pursued other courses of action. In 1916 a plaque {{was raised to}} honor `Abdu'l-Bahá's visit at Bad Mergentheim. [...] On May 23, 1916, Austrian Franz Pöllinger learned of the religion while staying in Stuttgart and on returning to Austria had {{a prominent role in}} the growth of the religion there. When the United States entered the war, individuals from there, as Fischer and Knobloch, had to leave Germany and both returned to the United States. On return to the US Fischer went to the Los Angeles area and Knobloch went to New York. In a wave of anti-German sentiment (see German American internment for similar issues a generation later) Fischer was caught up in charges of espionage for Germany which were dismissed. As Germany was allied with the Ottoman Empire, the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I played an important role with the Bahá'ís in Palestine - particularly the Battle of Megiddo in September 1918. As {{a direct result of the}} events of the battle, `Abdu'l-Bahá was rescued after death threats were made against him in case the Ottoman side was to lose (events in which Wellesley Tudor Pole played a significant part.) ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{resigned}} from the advertising industry in 1964, moved into a modest apartment near the Queens-Midtown Tunnel ("It wasn’t Paris in the 1920s, but I was happy" [...] DeLillo has said of this time), and began work on his first novel. Reflecting on {{the early days of}} his writing career, he remarked: [...] "I lived in a very minimal kind of way. My telephone would be $4.20 every month. I was paying a rent of sixty dollars a month. And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> a writer. So in one sense, I was ignoring the movements of the time." [...] His first novel, Americana, was written over the course of four years and finally published in 1971, to modest critical praise. Americana concerned [...] "a television network programmer who hits the road in search of the big picture". DeLillo revised the novel in 1989 for paperback re-printing. Reflecting on the novel later in his career, he admitted, [...] "I don't think my first novel would have been published today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published." [...] Later still, DeLillo still felt a degree of surprise at Americana being published, noting [...] "I was working on my first novel, Americana, for two years before I ever realized that I could be a writer [...] I had absolutely no assurance that this book would be published because I knew that there were elements that I simply didn't know how to improve at that point. So I wrote for another two years and finished the novel. It wasn’t all that difficult to find a publisher, to my astonishment. I didn't have a representative. I didn’t know anything about publishing. But an editor at Houghton Mifflin read the manuscript and decided that this was worth pursuing." ...|$|E
