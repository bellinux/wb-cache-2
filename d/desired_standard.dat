60|$|He {{took up his}} {{position}} {{in the shadow of}} a fir-tree with his back to the house. From here he could see the long garden. He was fond of his garden, and spent what few moments he could spare from work and games pottering about it. He had his views as to what the ideal garden should be, and he hoped in time to tinker his own three acres up to the <b>desired</b> <b>standard.</b> At present there remained much to be done. Why not, for instance, take away those laurels at the end of the lawn, and have a flower-bed there instead? Laurels lasted all the year round, true, whereas flowers died and left an empty brown bed in the winter, but then laurels were nothing much to look at at any time, and a garden always had a beastly appearance in winter, whatever you did to it. Much better have flowers, and get a decent show for one's money in summer at any rate.|$|E

50|$|Contrary to the ‘bottom-up’ approach, many place {{management}} schemes {{have been}} initially formed publicly by local government, which has provided funding {{to create the}} post of a place manager. Local government is often seen as a natural home for place management initiatives, as its remit will be to obtain a <b>desired</b> <b>standard</b> of living for its residents.

50|$|Both beta {{counting}} and AMS measure {{standard samples}} {{as part of}} their methodology. These samples contain carbon of a known activity. The first standard, Oxalic Acid SRM 4990B, also referred to as HOxI, was a 1,000 lb batch of oxalic acid created in 1955 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Since it was created after the start of atomic testing, it incorporates bomb carbon, so measured activity is higher than the <b>desired</b> <b>standard.</b> This is addressed by defining the standard to be 0.95 times the activity of HOxI.|$|E

Out of 183 zoos refused recognition, 92 have been closed down and their animals relocated suitably. Cases of the remaining 91 derecognized zoos are currently under review. The Authority’s role {{is more of a}} facilitator than a regulator. It, therefore, provides technical and financial assistance to such zoos which have the potential to attain the <b>desired</b> <b>standard</b> in animal management. Only such captive facilities which have neither the managerial skills nor the requisite resources are asked to close down.|$|E

The Companies Act 2013 section 166 lists directors' duties in seven simple sections, which reflect the existing principles developed by the case law in the courts around most Commonwealth countries, in common law and equity. Part {{of the reason for}} codification of directors' duties was to provide a transparent statement of the duties directors owe, and therefore to publicise principles of best practice. However, because of their generality, the case of law of the courts matters to interpret how duties will apply in specific situations.|$|E

50|$|A {{partially}} Observable system, {{unlike a}} system that clearly displays a full state of its components at any given time, attends to display the invisibility {{of one or more}} of its external or internal components at any given time. As technology expends, reliability, performance and safety becomes more and more important. Surveillance of system behavior helps to track hazards and performance. Surveillance is a method used as a tool to help understanding or control the impact of new products or technology. Surveillance is the monitoring of responses and adverse effects. System surveillance is the process of monitoring the performance of objects, a population, or process within a system to understand or to achieve a <b>desired</b> <b>standard</b> of performance. The simplest components of surveillance are observation, examination, analysis and supervision.|$|E
50|$|The skill {{involved}} in casting weights was enormous; as most weights {{were less than}} 2½ ounces and their exact mass was meticulously measured. They were a standard of measure {{to be used in}} trade, and had to be accurate. The goldsmith, or adwumfo, would make adjustments if the casting weighed too much or too little. Even the most beautiful, figurative weights had limbs and horns removed, or edges filed down until it met the closest weight equivalent. Weights that were not heavy enough would have small lead rings or glass beads attached to bring up the weight to the <b>desired</b> <b>standard.</b> There are far more weights without modifications than not, speaking to the talent of the goldsmiths. Most weights were within 3% of their theoretical value; this variance is similar to those of European nest weights from the same time.|$|E
5000|$|... 2010 saw {{a change}} in the {{charitable}} objective of the association. YHAI announced the largest plan of network renewal. As of now there are 50+ franchisee hostels and YHAI regularly monitors all its hostels to establish if they are still viable and if necessary closes those that are no longer viable or have no prospects of becoming viable again in the future. However the network renewal project was on top of this regular review and was a proposal to increase the network to more than 100 by 2011. The aim of the exercise was to reduce borrowing and to provide funds for re-investment into the network. The hostels involved were not necessarily poor performers but ones where the amount of investment required to bring them up to a <b>desired</b> <b>standard</b> was excessive, or in some cases because the site value was very high.|$|E

50|$|The Constabulary became {{operational}} on 1 July 1946 as scheduled, {{despite the}} fact that its training program had not been completed. Changes in the redeployment rules caused the loss within a few weeks of 8,000 troopers, 25 percent of the total strength. During the first two months of operations 14,000 men, or 42.7 percent of the total strength, were lost through redeployment. The replacement and training task at that time were staggering. To make matters worse, there was a critical shortage in the Constabulary of junior officers during the late summer of 1946. This delayed the Constabulary in attaining the <b>desired</b> <b>standards</b> in discipline and operations, and was the cause of many changes in operational techniques.|$|R
50|$|A {{proposal}} in 1975 {{by a big}} Greek chemical company, Chropei of Piraeus, for the adoption of its own-developed rifles and submachine guns, was rejected after testing proved that its weapons were not up to <b>desired</b> <b>standards.</b> Similarly, the Greek state did not support Pyrkal, which was already producing the FN FAL rifle under license. Subsequently, EBO was founded by the state in Aigio in 1976, after an agreement to initially produce under licence Heckler & Koch models adopted by the Greek Army, but {{with the intent to}} also design arms of its own. During its foundation ceremony, a Greek pistol of the 1820s (used in the Greek Revolution) was placed on the foundation stone to represent the continuity of Greece's arms-making craft.|$|R
