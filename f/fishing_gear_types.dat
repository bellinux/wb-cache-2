40|$|We {{reviewed}} {{the literature on}} incidental catches of pinnipeds by commercial fisheries using both passive and active <b>fishing</b> <b>gear.</b> Few incidental catch data were available for most species, although {{a substantial amount of}} information has recently become available for species in the North Pacific Ocean and the Northwest Atlantic Ocean off Eastern Canada. Incidental catches in passive gear appear to be of sufficient magnitude to have contributed to population declines of northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and Kuril seals (Phoca vitulina stejnegeri) in the North Pacific and harp seals (P. groenlandica) from the Barents Sea. Incidental catches in active gear appear at least partially responsible for the decline of northern sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in the North Pacific. Detrimental impacts of incidental catches are also indicated for New Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri) off the Auckland Islands, harbour seals (P. vitulina concolor) off Newfoundland and Alaska, grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in the eastern Baltic and for endangered Mediterranean (Monachus monachus) and Hawaiian (M. schauinslandi) monk seals. Several factors appear to influence incidental catches of pinnipeds, including behavioural traits of individual species, age of individuals, <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>type,</b> and the temporal and spatial overlap of a species' range with fishing activities.

The gillnet selectivity of most freshwater fish is poorly known. We caught 694 individuals of eight widely-distributed freshwater fish species (seven cyprinids and the pikeperch, Sander lucioperca) with multi-mesh gillnets in Spanish reservoirs. The SELECT method was applied to fit four different gillnet selectivity models (normal location, normal scale, lognormal, and gamma). The normal scale model (spread proportional to mesh size) had the best fit {{in four of the}} eight fish species. Predicted modal lengths for the best fit models are given to describe gillnet selectivity for the eight fish species.

Cape Creus is lately being subjected of study in order to assess its values in the frame of European Directives. By combining existing data of artisanal fisheries’ components together with gathered seabed components, a spatial distribution of fishing activity is pretended. A spatial approach has been the main tool when assessing the consistency of fishing pressure onto the seabed. Benthic communities seem to be more affected when overlapping of fishing types occur. Consequently, alternating parceling and seasonal closures among <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>types,</b> to minimize the impact onto benthic communities as also setting no-take zones is strongly suggested.

40|$|The Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 {{mandates}} that regional fishery management Councils designate essential fish habitat (EFH) {{for each of}} the species which are managed, assess the effects of fishing on EFH, and develop conservation measures for EFH where needed. This synthesis of effects of fishing on fish habitat was produced to aid the fishery management councils in assessing the impacts of fishing activities. A wide range of studies were reviewed that reported effects of fishing on habitat (i. e., structural habitat components, community structure, and ecosystemprocesses) for adiversity of habitats and <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>types.</b> Commonalities of all studies included immediate effects on species composition and diversity and a reduction in habitat complexity. Studies of acute effects were found to be a good predictor of chronic effects.

The ultimate goal of gear impact studies should not be to retrospectively analyze environmental impacts but ultimately to develop the ability to predict outcomes of particular management regimes. Synthesizing the results of these studies into predictive numerical models is not currently possible. However, conceptual models are presented which coalesce the patterns found over the range of observations. Conceptual models can be used to predict effects of gear impacts within the framework of current ecological theory.

40|$|One of {{potential}} fishing grounds for small pelagic fish in Southeast Mallucas Regency is Rosenberg Strait waters. In this region, {{a study on}} the effect of different light intensities of floating lift net on fish catches was carried out. The analyses were done on light distribution of 4 light intensities different: Petromaks Lamp and Underwater Lamps of each 18 watt, 36 watt and 54 watt. This study showed that catches of floating lift net using different light intensities were statistically significantly different. The use of 36 watt and 54 watt underwater lamp yielded the same amount of catches but higher than that of 18 watt-underwater lamp and petromaks, both in number and species. Catches consisted of 17 species, 16 fishs and 1 mollusca. Number of species and size also varied with light intensity used. There were 13 fishs species dominated by Stolephorus indicus as much as 46. 9 kg or 22 % for petromaks catches, 14 fishs species dominated by Rastrelliger kanagurata as much as 64 kg (31 %) for 18 watt underwater lamp, 17 fishs species dominated by Rastrelliger kanagurata as much as 76 kg (28 %) for 36 watt underwater lamp, and 15 fishs species dominated by Stolephorus devisi as much as 54. 8 kg (22 %) for 54 watt underwater lamp, respectively. Based on the results, it is recommended that the use of light intensity in fishing operations of floating lift net should be 36 watt and 54 watt underwater lamps, due to high catches, both in number and species.

40|$|The {{sablefish}} Anoplopoma fimbria is {{a valuable}} North Pacific Ocean species that, when not targeted in various commercial fisheries, is often a part of discarded bycatch. Predictions of the survival of discarded fish are dependent on understanding how a fish responds to stressful conditions. Our objective was to describe the immunological health of sablefish exposed to capture stressors. In laboratory experiments designed to simulate the capture process, we subjected sablefish to various stressors that might influence survival: Towing in a net, hooking, elevated seawater and air temperatures, and air exposure time. After stress was imposed, the in vitro mitogen-stimulated proliferation of sablefish leukocytes {{was used to evaluate}} the function of the immune system in an assay we validated for this species. The results demonstrated that regardless of <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>type,</b> exposure to elevated seawater temperature, or time in air, the leukocytes from stressed sablefish exhibited significantly diminished proliferative responses to the T-cell mitogen, concanavalin A, or the B-cell mitogen, lipopolysaccharide.

The duration and severity of the capture stressors applied in our study were harsh enough to induce significantly elevated levels of plasma cortisol and glucose, but {{there was no difference in}} the magnitude of levels among stressor treatments. These data suggest that immunological suppression occurs in sablefish subjected to capture-related stressors. The functional impairment of the immune system after capture presents a potential reason why delayed mortality is possible in discarded sablefish. Further studies are needed to determine whether delayed mortality in discarded sablefish can be caused by increased susceptibility to infectious agents resulting from stressor-mediated immunosuppression...|$|R

Their migratory behavior exposes them to multiple <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> and fishing practices and efforts to understand the rates of interaction between these taxa and fishing necessarily entails analysis of data over large spatial areas (ocean-basin) and multiple types of fishing activities. The acquisition the requisite data, however, requires considerable resources and many regions {{in the world are}} data-poor with respect to bycatch, including the Wider Caribbean Region (WCR) in the west central Atlantic Ocean basin. This dissertation presents the results of multiple strategies used to assess sea turtle, marine mammal and seabird bycatch in the WCR, with a particular focus on sea turtle bycatch. The research incorporated a synthetic review of the literature, expert consultation, statistical techniques, and geospatial analyses to assess the bycatch seascape for the region. I conclude that sea turtle bycatch in the WRC is significantly linked to turtle rookeries, especially those on the continental land mass and in the southern section of the Caribbean basin, {{in large part because of}} the near shore artisanal nature of the fisheries and the importance of these habitats for foraging and reproduction. The limited information on marine mammal bycatch does not permit robust inferences, but it clearly identifies threats to at least one vulnerable marine mammal species, the tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis). Information on seabird bycatch was even more limited; the most vulnerable seabird populations occur in the higher latitudes (temperate zones) while the seabird populations in the WCR face significant threats from habitat loss and over-exploitation.

40|$|The present {{research}} aims at examining commercial fishermen’s subjective resilience to management changes in two Southern New England fishing ports. This study also aims at analyzing {{the relationship between}} job satisfaction and level of occupational attachment with fishermen’s perceived ability to adapt and cope to change. The two age groups examined were categorized into a younger and older generation by splitting the mean age value of 46. 6 to 45 for the older generation. Three hypotheses were developed: 1) Management practices have negatively influenced older fishermen’s perceptions {{on their ability to}} adapt to changes, where younger fishers perceive to be more resilient to management changes; 2) Level of resilience varies between <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>types.</b> For example, those fishers participating in net fisheries perceive to be less resilient and able to adapt to changes than those fishing dredge gear; and 3) Between port differences may influence the relationships between variables in the first two hypotheses. In order to test these hypotheses, a total of 92 interviews were conducted with fishermen from the ports of Point Judith, Rhode Island and New Bedford, Massachusetts. Results of analyses show that there is no difference between age groups on fishermen’s perceived level of resilience. However, results show a positive relationship between age and fishermen’s Perceptions of Risk. Those involved in dredge gear fisheries (scallop, ocean clam/quahog) were shown to be more confident in their ability to adapt and cope to management changes. Results suggest that income and monetary gains {{play an important role in}} fishermen’s perception of their ability to adapt and cope with changes. Correlations between levels of job satisfaction components suggest that a decrease in satisfaction with income and financial needs could result in lower levels of perceived ability to adapt and cope with management changes.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDIn this thesis, I examine {{household}} {{strategies in}} response to water level fluctuations of Lake Chilwa. I also analyse the frequency and patterns of migration of fishers, conflicts due to migration of fishers and comanagement. The following are the key results:First, the seasonal and periodic lake level changes affect livelihoods of the households. As a coping strategy, the households depend on fishing in pools of water located in influent rivers and hunt birds for income and food while others migrate to find work as casual labourers. When the lake rises during the rain season, inundated areas become suitable for production of maize and rice. However, when the floods recede in the dry season, farming of winter maize and vegetables is common. Second, migration of fishers is common around Lake Chilwa. The pattern of migration varies according to the season and gear type. The northern marshes and floodplain where fishers land the highest catches composed mainly of Barbus paludinosus, attract more fishers operating different <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>types.</b> Conflicts emerge due to the Nkacha seine operations,which require removal of aquatic vegetation. The local fishers believe that the aquatic vegetation {{is a source of}} food for fish. The conflicts are in various forms including access to fishing grounds, authority to grant access to fishing areas and fish price competition between the local fishers and migrants. Third, the household strategies towards recovery of the fishery after recessions are inherent within the households’ traditional system. However, the introduction of co-management does not recognise key actors that include fishers and river-based fishing households that participated in the formulation of conservation strategies for remnant fish stocks in lagoon and rivers during the 1995 recession. Co-management is characterised by limited participation of the fishers especially those operating seines, district assemblies and non-governmental organisations. Similarly, there is low transparency especially with respect to how the key stakeholders, Department of Fisheries and traditional leaders, take decisions. In stark contrast, accountability among Beach Village Sub- Committees is growing; hence more fishing households now perceive these as representing the interests of Department of Fisheries. Based on the above results, a diversified occupational change involving fishing, farming and trading is necessary. The co-management arrangement should be adaptive with consideration of the traditional customs and values of the participating households. Since these households are dependent on the availability of fisheries, it is thus imperative to promote maximum resource exploitation in between recessions and encourage a complete stop to fishing during recessions.

Canoes may be motorized or hand-paddled. Common <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> include shrimp traps, drift gill nets, set gill nets, cast nets, seine nets, hook and lines. Lift nets may be use by women folk who target small shrimp species in the creeks and creek lets. Other fishing methods include hand-picking for periwinkles, oysters and other shellfish by women folk and children. Prominent among the fishing devices are edek, a type of fish fence used in the creeks; alot, a large trap used on sand and mud-banks in the estuaries; and otunwa, a barbed spear. Fishers using these devices either operated from their home villages, exploiting the nearby waters, or staged long distance fishing expeditions, during which they lived in distant camps or house-boats. The heavy metals concentration level values are: Cd (0. 013 a± 0. 001), Cr (2. 04 b± 0. 01), Cu (2. 16 b± 0. 10), Pb (2. 20 b± 0. 16) and Zn (1. 03 ab± 0. 03) for Lagocephalus laevigatus; Cd (0. 01 a± 0. 001), Cr (1. 60 b± 0. 44), Cu (1. 25 ab± 0. 08), Pb (1. 10 ab± 0. 15) and Zn (0. 50 b± 0. 04) for Tarpon atlantica and Cd (0. 02 ab± 0. 003), Cr (2. 35 ab± 0. 40), Cu (2. 60 a± 0. 08), Pb (2. 30 a± 0. 45) and Zn (1. 11 a± 0. 17) for Pristis pristis. The presence of heavy metals in the fish samples examined is an evidence of environmental degradation...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out in September 1996 {{alongside}} the annual frame survey of Kainji Lake, Nigeria. As in the previous surveys, there were 6 main <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> in use on the lake, which included gill nets, drift nets, beach seines, cast nets, longlines (baited and foul hooking) acid fishing traps. A total of 813 canoes were sampled. The canoe lengths were similar to the previous gear surveys. Altogether 466 gill nets were measured. They had an average length of 149 m, and were mostly bottom set. Of the gill nets measured 68 % had a mesh size below 3 inches the minimum mesh size allowable according to the Niger and Kebbi State Fisheries Edict, 1996. Of concern was the large {{increase in the number of}} 1 inch meshed nets recorded on the lake. Drift nets had a mean length of 74 m. A total of 88 % of all drift nets measured had a mesh size below 2. 5 inches, the minimum mesh size stipulated in the State Edict. A total number of 102 beach seines were sampled with a mean length of 110 m, the mesh size in use on the lake remained as 0. 1 inches under the Edict beach seines are banned from fishing in Kainji Lake. The decline in the lengths of the beach seines (and therefore catch rates) recorded since l 995 was encouraging in the light of the destructive nature of these nets. A total of 30 cast nets were sampled, they had a mean diameter of 9. 8 and a mean mesh size of 1. 9 inches. All the nets had a hanging ratio of 0. 5. Of the cast nets measured 40 % had a mesh size below the minimum size of 2 inches recommended by the State Fisheries Edicts. Of concern was the continued rise in the number of gill nets with mesh sizes less than 2 inches. There were 2 types of longlines in operation on the lake. The baited and the foul hooking longlines. They were mostly bottom set and the hook size nos. 12 - 14 (Kirby sea hook) were predominant. Two types of fishing traps were identified, one was covered with a mesh of thin cane, one with netting material. The fishing traps had a mean height of 0. 8 m and a mean width at the vase of 0. 53 m. The mean mesh size used was 0. 86 inches. Citharinus was reported as the most targeted of all fish species on the lake. Synodontis membranaceous was also targeted by most gears especially the smaller meshed nets. Labeo and Tilapia were low on the list of targeted species but their incidence remains high in the catches. (PDF contains 27 pages...|$|E
40|$|Commercial and {{recreational}} fisheries {{around the world}} typically target specific catch species, but often capture other species incidentally, {{some of which are}} retained (byproduct) and others are discarded (bycatch). This incidental fisheries capture is a major threat to global elasmobranch (shark and ray) populations because bycaught animals can die during capture or post-release. Furthermore, their life history traits of slow growth, late maturity, and low fecundity put elasmobranchs at generally greater ecological risk of overexploitation than bony fish species. Although the potentially deleterious effects of incidental capture are raising conservation and sustainability concerns, factors influencing the immediate and post-release mortality rates of elasmobranch discards are not fully understood. Accordingly, a greater understanding of the factors affecting these mortality rates is necessary to develop fisheries management strategies that reduce the detrimental effects of fisheries capture on elasmobranch bycatch. This study aimed to address these knowledge gaps by investigating environmental, operational, and physiological factors contributing to immediate and post-release mortality in elasmobranchs. This was achieved by a combination of meta-analysis, field sampling, laboratory analysis, and modelling of capture data. Species-specific analyses were conducted on log-book and empirical data and revealed that several factors influenced immediate mortality rates in longline-caught sharks, including capture duration (bronze whalers), sea surface temperature (blue sharks), fishing location(blue sharks, tiger sharks), regulatory period (blue sharks, tiger sharks), target catch (blue sharks, tiger sharks), and an interaction effect between regulatory period and fishing location(blue sharks). Following gillnet capture, total length was the only factor examined that affected immediate mortality rates (blacktip reef sharks). To determine how contrasting respiratory strategies and <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> can influence mortality, I conducted a multi-species meta-analysis on published elasmobranch immediate and post-release mortality rates. This meta-analysis revealed that elasmobranch immediate and post-release mortality are more likely during trawl and gillnet capture than longline capture, and that obligate ram-ventilating species are particularly susceptible to mortality. Hematological analyses showed that high concentrations of plasma lactate and potassium were correlated with poor capture condition in bronze whalers. As high plasma lactate and potassium concentrations are associated with struggling and insufficient oxygen intake during capture, this result further demonstrated the vulnerability of obligate ram-ventilating sharks to immediate mortality caused by fisheries capture. My results suggest that fisheries management strategies such as reductions in allowable soak times and the mandatory use of circle hooks can effectively reduce immediate mortality rates in several shark species, such as bronze whalers and blue sharks. Following a reduction in immediate mortality rates, fisheries management strategies that promote the rapid release of bycatch can be effective. However, several elasmobranch species and groups have inherently high immediate mortality rates following capture (e. g. nervous sharks and juvenile blacktip reef sharks). Given the high immediate mortality rates of these species, catch and release is not a viable conservation strategy. Fisheries regulations designed to protect species with high immediate and post-release mortality rates should instead minimize the likelihood of interactions with fishing gear (e. g. gear modifications such as changing minimum allowable gillnet mesh size or spatio-temporal closures). The strategies recommended can be implemented to reduce the pressures global fisheries exert on elasmobranch bycatch populations...|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Oceanography in the Faculty of Applied Sciences at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2014 The Tristan lobster Jasus tristani is distributed among several isolated islands and submerged seamounts in the South East Atlantic Ocean. This species occurs only at the Tristan da Cunha group, a British Overseas Territory and the World’s most remote inhabited island, and in international waters at Vema Seamount 1680 km ENE of Tristan. All these populations are exploited commercially. The catch, processing and export of J. tristani {{is the most important}} economic activity for the inhabitants of Tristan da Cunha, providing the livelihood of many families and accounting for approximately 80 % of the Island’s revenue. Sustainable harvesting of this valuable resource requires accurate long-term data on catch and effort, as well as information on the most important biological parameters such as growth, recruitment, moulting and reproductive cycles. This information is critical for robust assessments and management strategies. This thesis describes the history of the lobster fishery at the Tristan da Cunha island group, reporting on catches and trends in Catch Per Unit Effort between 1967 and 2010. A total of 247, 014 lobster samples, both sexes combined, was sampled for size composition and sex ratios, as well as 1, 526 lobsters for length/weight relationships, between 1997 and 2010. This confirms earlier findings that females have broader and heavier tails than males for the same carapace length (CL). Results show that males dominate catches at all islands, and their average size was larger than that of females (83. 5 ± 14. 46 versus 73. 4 ± 8. 64 mm CL, respectively). Inter-island differences in lobster population structure appear to be caused by differences of food availability as well as in density-dependent growth and survival of young lobsters. The largest lobsters were found at Gough Island (87. 2 ± 15. 13 mm CL), and the smallest at Inaccessible island (73. 2 ± 11. 39 mm). Tristan was the next largest to Gough Island (84. 0 ± 12. 56 mm) followed by Nightingale island (78. 2 ± 11. 33 mm). Lobsters caught inshore were larger than those caught offshore, although this may be related in part to differences in catches between <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>types.</b> This study showed that fecundity increases in a linear manner with CL, and although larger lobsters clearly produce more eggs than smaller ones, the gain in fecundity is not as great as in some lobster species where fecundity is more closely associated with weight. The study showed no significant differences in egg size between islands, or between large and small females at one island. The egg production per gram of body weight and mean egg diameter both seem to be less than reported in an earlier study in the 1990 s. While it seems likely that this is due to differences {{in the way in which}} samples were collected (with only stage 2 ova collected and measured in this study), the possibility of a decline in fecundity needs to be investigated further. A range of management measures have been developed over the history of the fishery, and important current measures include an annual total allowable catch (TAC) for each island, minimum size limits, and a closed season timed to protect egg-bearing females. The fishery has recently been awarded certification by the Marine Stewardship Council. The study has confirmed that current conversion factors are broadly correct and that different size limits established for each island are justified. Concern is raised, however, by the fall in catch per unit effort and the mean size of lobsters at the three northern islands over the past 7 years. These trends will need to be closely monitored. There are still many uncertainties over key parameters such as growth and recruitment and the intention is to increase the knowledge base and our understanding of the dynamics of the lobster stock. A research plan has been developed, so that progress can be monitored through the gradual implementation of scientifically defendable fisheries management procedures and increased research and monitoring capacity...|$|E
40|$|The {{river lamprey}} (Lampetra fluviatilis (L.)) is an {{anadromous}} fish {{that has a}} growth phase in the sea, then migrates up rivers mainly during autumn for spawning next spring. It is during this spawning migration the lampreys are caught in rivers.

40|$|Situation: A {{permanent}} {{monitoring program}} for the shore-based Pacific whiting fleet needs to be developed and implemented, because of the specification in the Pacific Coast salmon and groundfish fishery management plans (FMPs) and the 1992 Biological Opinion analyzing {{the effects of the}} groundfish fishery on salmon stocks listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The issue of salmon retention in the groundfish trawl fisheries was brought before the Council in 1997 in the form of Amendment 10 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish FMP and Amendment 12 to the Pacific Coast Salmon FMP. Based on an Environmental Assessment drafted to analyze these amendments, the Council recommended the exempted fishery permit (EFP) process be used temporarily until a permanent monitoring program could be developed and implemented in the shore-based Pacific whiting fishery. EFPs are intended to provide for limited testing of a <b>fishing</b> strategy, <b>gear</b> <b>type,</b> or monitoring program that may eventually be implemented on a larger fleet-wide scale and are not a permanent solution to the monitoring needs of the shore-based Pacific whiting fishery. Results of the shore-based Pacific whiting EFPs indicate that it is feasible to retain and appropriately monitor the incidental take of salmon and groundfish other than Pacific whiting in the shore-based Pacific whiting fishery. It is now appropriate to implement a permanent monitoring program for salmon an...|$|R
50|$|Minke {{whales are}} {{occasionally}} caught in <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> of various <b>types,</b> including set nets, fish pots, gillnets, trap nets, trawls, longlines, and seines. Entanglements {{have been reported}} off Korea, Japan, Canada, the United States, the Azores, Scotland, Portugal, France, Italy, Greece, Tunisia, Israel, the Canary Islands, Senegal, and Brazil. A total of 1,156 minke whales were caught off Korea between 1996 and 2008, {{an average of about}} 88 per year. They were mainly caught with set nets (31.4%), fish pots (27.3%), and gillnets (26.2%). Most were juveniles. Of 17 individuals that were reported caught in trap nets off eastern Honshu between 1978 and 1990, only two escaped alive, the rest being sold for their meat. Ship strikes are another source of mortality. They have been reported off the east coast of the United States, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and off Italy. A dwarf minke whale calf that stranded in New South Wales had one of its flukes cut by a propeller, which was the likely reason for its stranding and ensuing death.|$|R
