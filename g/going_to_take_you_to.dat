60|$|PATIOMKIN [jumping up and {{stopping}} {{him on his}} way to the door]. Tut tut! I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the Empress now, this very instant.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> headquarters. They would {{dispose of}} you there; but Numa {{can do it}} quite as effectively. Which do you prefer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> our bungalows," [...] {{announced}} Dave. [...] "There {{you will}} have the pleasure of talking the matter over with Mr. Wadsworth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All arranged," [...] {{answered}} Sam. [...] "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> up. Dick is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Dora in a buggy, and Tom and I are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> and Nellie in a two-seated. The baggage {{can go in}} a wagon behind." ...|$|R
60|$|Come back, <b>you</b> maniac. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> home, and you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> lie down.|$|R
5000|$|... in [...] "I'm Going to Buy You a Gun" [...] (!): [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> out on I-95" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come along," [...] Kendricks suggested. [...] "We shan't get a {{table at}} all {{at the place where}} I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> dine, unless we are punctual." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Home!" [...] he {{ridiculed}} the notion. [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{the prettiest}} road you ever saw--around by French's Lower Falls. I only {{wish it was}} summer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> supper, and you {{can send}} me off when you like afterwards," [...] he said and started across the square. A famous {{restaurant}} was not far off.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, Tommy,' said Merton, 'we must waken Batsy, and Miss Blossom is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> both home. Hope {{we shall}} often meet.' ...|$|R
60|$|LAWTON: 'If <b>you</b> suppose I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> at {{your own}} figure--' They walk up the room together, and return as before.|$|R
6000|$|O'FLAHERTY. Hold your noise, I tell you. Who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> leave <b>you?</b> I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> with me. There now: {{does that}} satisfy you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, Decker, {{how long}} is it <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> hitch up?" [...] {{interrupted}} a voice from the doorway, and the next instant Mr. Woodward strode into the barn, followed by John Stumpy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hold your tongue,' {{said the}} King, very crossly. 'I intend you to behave prettily to her. So now go and make {{yourself}} {{fit to be}} seen, as I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> visit her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] she said, [...] "it is {{too cold}} to sit down. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Onetree Farm. Mrs. Foulton must give us some tea. I have a reason, too," [...] she added more slowly, [...] "for taking you there." ...|$|E
6000|$|They were at once forthcoming. [...] "What the deuce {{are they}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> away for?" [...] he said. [...] "Is your {{education}} finished?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> into my husband's study," [...] she suggested, {{later on}} in the evening. [...] "He has some {{specimens}} of beetles--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let them alone, Ferris, {{and come}} along. You'll {{get most of}} what you lost back to-morrow, and we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> home," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> these club-rooms to-night," [...] went on Pepper. [...] "It'll cause {{a hell of}} a row. But {{once you}} get in, there'll be no help for them. Swann and his chums will have to stand for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|ANNA--All right. Maybe I do. But don't rub it in. Why ain't {{you done}} {{what you said}} you was going to? Why ain't you got that ship was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{the other side of}} the earth where you'd never see me again? ...|$|E
6000|$|He owned {{what his}} object was unreservedly. 'I want, before all things,' he said, 'to satisfy {{your mind and}} mine, {{on the subject of}} Montbarry's death. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the doctor who {{attended}} him in his illness, and to the consul who followed him to the grave.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> {{away from}} here--down {{to my home}} in the country," [...] I said. [...] "Do {{you think you can}} stand the journey?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "C'est fini--l'affaire Poynton!" [...] he remarked. [...] "You can {{get ready}} {{as soon as}} you like, Guy. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> into Paris <b>to</b> your sister!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{smiled in}} melancholy irony at the bewilderment, the childish {{forgetfulness}} {{of all the}} circumstances, which her words expressed. [...] "Oh, no! I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you know}} we haven't got time {{for this sort of}} thing. Don't you see, we could {{distribute}} these people around the earth in less time than it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> explain that we can't. We mustn't talk now, we must act. You want to be careful; you mustn't let your mill get the start of you that way, at a time like this. To business now--and sharp's the word. Who is to take the aristocracy home?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are so convincing!" [...] Sophy murmured. [...] "There {{is such a}} {{finality}} {{about your}} statements that I would not venture to dispute them. But remember that your future entertainment {{is in the hands}} of two women, one of whom is a deserving but struggling young artist without the means of gratifying her expensive tastes. There are heaps of places we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> which even Louise pretends she cannot afford. It is so fortunate, Mr. Strangewey, that you are rich!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the Omicron spread, Mrs. Pasmer," [...] said young Mavering, {{coming up}} to her with such an effect of {{sympathetic}} devotion {{that she had to}} ask herself, [...] "Are they my friends, the Maverings?" [...] "The Saintsburys have been there already, and it is a little too common." [...] The tone of superiority gave Mrs. Pasmer courage. [...] "They're good fellows; and all that, but I want you to see the best. I suppose it will get back to giving the spreads all in the fellows' rooms again. It's a good deal pleasanter, don't you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{would not}} be gainsaid, and she was really glad to escape {{the crowd in the}} car. He said: [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> home <b>to</b> get warm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but write regularly?--Show that I {{think of}} her all the time? When I really think I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> from her, I seem so cruel and heartless!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{very kind}} of you to say so; but, even if I gain, stern justice is not what I most love. Is Mrs. Touchett <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> abroad?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must carry}} Miss Lalonde and her chair {{down to the}} very edge of the lawn, where she can see the river," [...] she told Arnold. [...] "Afterwards, I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> see my little rose garden. I say mine, but it is really my brother's, only it was my idea when he first took the place. Mr. Weatherley is going down to the boat-builder's to see some motor-launches--horrible things they are, but {{necessary}} if we stay here for the summer. Would you like some books or magazines, Miss Lalonde, or do you think you would care to come with us if we helped you very carefully?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pretty as a pink," [...] he returned. [...] "Gay,--isn't it?" [...] he continued, {{with a wink}} {{that took}} her into his {{confidence}} again, from which {{his study of the}} newspaper had seemed to exclude her. [...] "I'll tell you what I'm going to do: I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the Museum after dinner, and let you see Boucicault in the 'Colleen Bawn.'" [...] He swept his paper off the table and unfolded his napkin in his lap, and, leaning back in his chair, began to tell her about the play. [...] "We can walk: it's only just round the corner," [...] he said at the end.|$|E
6000|$|... "Janet," [...] said Mrs. Maturin {{the next}} day, as she {{laid down the}} book from which she was reading, [...] "do you {{remember}} that I spoke to you once in Hampton of coming here to Silliston? Well, now we've got you here, we don't want to lose you. I've been making inquiries; {{quite a number of}} the professors have typewriting to be done, and they will be glad to give their manuscripts to you instead of sending them to Boston. And there's Brooks Insall too--if he ever takes it into his head to write another book. You wouldn't have any trouble reading his manuscript, it's like script. Of course it has to be copied. You can board with Mrs. Case--I've arranged that, too. But on Monday I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> my house, and keep you until you're strong enough to walk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, {{let us take}} a cab then, by all means. I {{hope you}} don't suppose that I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> by the boat to save any money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Kemp, [...] "since the {{applicants}} are more numerous than the posts, I reckon another won't count. Do <b>you</b> expect they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> any farther," [...] she declared, [...] "especially as you {{are coming}} up to-night. Eight o'clock, remember. Go and salve your {{conscience}} with some work." ...|$|R
