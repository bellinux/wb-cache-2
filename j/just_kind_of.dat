5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> warped. From her perspective—first {{she has to}} eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> set in.|$|E

500|$|Oates {{was one of}} the NHL's great playmakers, a {{style that}} he credits his father as encouraging: [...] "It was <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> our family talks: 'If you can be unselfish, your {{teammates}} will always like you.' And it <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> became my role, where I was obviously trying to please my dad, growing up and becoming a playmaker out of that."

It <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> made sense. I started playing on pots and pans at a very early age, so I <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> flowed into it. It was just a natural progression."
