50|$|In {{the reverse}} direction, {{on the other}} hand, the {{additional}} delay of the wave from the director (blue) due to the spacing between the two elements (about 35° of phase delay traversed twice) causes it to be about 180° (110° + 2 × 35°) out of phase with the wave from the driven element (green). The net effect of these two waves, when added (bottom, left), is almost complete cancellation. The combination of the director's position and shorter length has thus obtained a unidirectional rather than the bidirectional response of the driven (<b>half-wave</b> dipole) <b>element</b> alone.|$|R

Uniform circular (UCA) and hexagonal arrays (UHA) with 18 <b>half-wave</b> dipole <b>elements</b> are examined; also planar (2 concentric rings of radiators) uniform circular (PUCA) and hexagonal arrays (PUHA) are considered. The effect of rotating the outer {{ring of the}} PUCA is studied. In our analysis, the method of moments is used to compute {{the response of the}} uniform circular and hexagonal dipole arrays in a mutual coupling environment.

50|$|One way of {{thinking}} about the operation of such an antenna is to consider a parasitic element to be a normal dipole element of finite diameter fed at its centre, with a short circuit across its feed point. As is well known in transmission line theory, a short circuit reflects all of the incident power 180 degrees out of phase. So one could as well model the operation of the parasitic element as the superposition of a dipole element receiving power and sending it down a transmission line to a matched load, and a transmitter sending the same amount of power up the transmission line back toward the antenna element. If the transmitted voltage wave were 180 degrees out of phase with the received wave at that point, the superposition of the two voltage waves would give zero voltage, equivalent to shorting out the dipole at the feedpoint (making it a solid element, as it is). Thus a <b>half-wave</b> parasitic <b>element</b> radiates a wave 180° out of phase with the incident wave.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{several factors}} which affect the channel {{capacity}} of multi-input multi-output communication {{systems have been}} studied under the assumption of a narrow-band Rayleigh fading channel. The first factor is the capacity's diversity property. The previously known result is verified that the outage (a certain probability is out) capacity of N 1 transmit antennas and N 2 receive antennas systems is {{higher than that of}} N 2 transmit antennas and N 1 receive antennas when they have the same signal-to-noise ratio and N 1 < N 2 in the independent and identically distributed Rayleigh fading channel. The second is the point of diminishing returns in the increase of capacity with the increase of the number of antennas. With the Monte Carlo simulation, it is found that six receive antennas reach the point of capacity diminishing returns for a small number of transmit antennas and four transmit antennas reach the point for a small number of receive antennas. The third is the correlation between different paths in a correlated narrow-band Rayleigh fading channel. It is shown that the receive antenna polarization matrix must be orthogonal with the incident source polarization matrix to achieve zero correlation. An abstract spherical model is introduced so that the effect of antenna pattern on the correlation and thus the capacity can be studied. It is found that the broadside linear array with the half-wave square patch microstrip antennas has higher outage capacity than that with half-wave dipole antennas in most orientations. This phenomenon still exists when both the transmit array and the receive array are square and rectangular arrays, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation model based on a statistical Student's t-distribution of angle-of-arrival is developed in order to investigate the effect of antenna pattern in a more realistic environment. It was found that the vertical linear array with <b>half-wave</b> patch microstrip <b>elements</b> has higher capacity than that with <b>half-wave</b> dipole <b>elements</b> in the orientation of the antenna visible region. However, for the horizontal linear array, the microstrip elements have different variation of capacity versus orientation with the dipole elements due to the effect of antenna pattern. The cross linear array illustrates higher capacity than the vertical and horizontal linear arrays, indicating that this array is closer to the condition of zero correlation...|$|R
5000|$|An antenna {{may have}} more than one driven element, {{although}} the most common multielement antenna, the Yagi, usually has only one. For example, transmitting antennas for AM radio stations often consist of several mast radiators, each of which functions as a <b>half-wave</b> monopole driven <b>element,</b> to create a particular radiation pattern. A two-element array with the elements spaced a quarter wavelength apart has a distinct cardioid radiation pattern when the second element is driven with a source -90° out of phase relative to the first element. A log-periodic antenna (LPDA) consists of many dipole elements of decreasing length, all of which are driven. However because they are different lengths, only one of the many dipoles is resonant at a given frequency, so only one is driven at a time. The dipole that is driven depends on the frequency of the signal. Phased arrays may have hundreds of driven elements. Household multiband television antennas generally consist of a hybrid between a UHF Yagi with one driven dipole and a log-periodic for VHF behind that with alternating active elements. The driven elements between the UHF and VHF are then coupled and often matched for a 75 ohm coaxial downlead to the receiver.|$|R
