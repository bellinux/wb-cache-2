The roadway {{passes through}} Smith Roach Gap {{and comes to}} the Bacon Hollow Overlook to the south, where it curves to the west. The <b>drive</b> <b>heads</b> through Powell Gap and reaches the west-facing Eaton Hollow Overlook, where it turns to the southwest and winds along. The road bends south and comes to a ranger station at Simmonds Gap. Skyline Drive continues southerly to the Loft Mountain Overlook on the east side, where it turns westerly before heading northwest. The roadway then makes a hairpin turn to the southwest. The road straddles the border of Rockingham and Albemarle counties and continues to the south to the Loft Mountain Wayside, which is site of restrooms and food service. Skyline <b>Drive</b> <b>heads</b> southwest and comes to Loft Mountain, where a ranger station, restrooms, campground, and camp store are located.

5|$|The {{alignment}} of State Route 237 began at an intersection with its parent highway, State Route 37 in Lackawaxen Township, near Roebling's Delaware Aqueduct. This {{is currently the}} intersection with State Route 590. The highway heads eastward {{along the banks of}} the Delaware River and a nearby railroad track towards Shohola Township. There is an intersection with Delaware Drive just after the inception. Delaware <b>Drive</b> <b>heads</b> to a dead-end at the banks of the Delaware River. The highway passes some homes to the north and a dense forest to the south. There is also a mansion atop a nearby hill. After a clearing, the highway enters the dense forest completely and turns to the southeast.|$|E

The route, named Riverside <b>Drive,</b> <b>heads</b> eastward along the Mohawk River, paralleling the New York State Thruway (I-90) and NY5S to the south. It initially serves a residential area of the village; however, the houses quickly give way to an area of truck stops and other businesses—predominately dining, fuel, and lodging—surrounding Riverside Drive's interchange with the Thruway on {{the eastern edge of the}} village. Past exit28, the development along the highway slowly decreases in density as Riverside <b>Drive</b> <b>heads</b> through the town of Glen.|$|E

25|$|Aerodynamics is {{important}} {{in a number of}} applications other than aerospace engineering. It is a significant factor in any type of vehicle design, including automobiles. It {{is important}} in the prediction of forces and moments acting on sailing vessels. It is used in the design of mechanical components such as hard <b>drive</b> <b>heads.</b> Structural engineers also use aerodynamics, and particularly aeroelasticity, to calculate wind loads in the design of large buildings and bridges. Urban aerodynamics seeks to help town planners and designers improve comfort in outdoor spaces, create urban microclimates and reduce the effects of urban pollution. The field of environmental aerodynamics describes the ways atmospheric circulation and flight mechanics affect ecosystems. The aerodynamics of internal passages {{is important in}} heating/ventilation, gas piping, and in automotive engines where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine.|$|E
500|$|Skyline Drive winds {{south and}} reaches the Dickey Ridge Visitor Center, {{which has a}} ranger station, picnic grounds, and restrooms. Farther south, the roadway reaches Dickey Hill. The road {{continues}} southerly to the Gooney Knob Overlook facing southwest, at which point it turns to the [...] east and winds through Low Gap. The <b>drive</b> <b>heads</b> east to an overlook at Compton Gap, where it bends south along a winding path, straddling the border of Warren and Rappahannock counties, and runs parallel to the Appalachian Trail, which closely follows Skyline Drive {{for the remainder of}} its route. The road curves southwest and reaches the summit of North Marshall. Upon reaching the south-facing Range View Overlook, the roadway turns to the west along a winding path, bending southwest The drive passes the Mount Marshall Overlook on the east side, at which point it heads west.|$|E
500|$|The road is a [...] loop {{that can}} be driven or bicycled. Hiking the roadway is permitted, but not {{encouraged}} because of the traffic. The roadway starts at an entrance off M-109 (DH Day Highway) south of Glen Lake. There is a parking lot inside the entrance for visitors who wish to bike or hike the road. From there, the drive continues as a two-way road to the entrance gate before turning northward as a one-way road. There are 12 numbered locations along the road that {{are listed in the}} drive's interpretive brochure. The first of these is a covered bridge. After this point, the drive ascends a steep hill to an overlook of Glen Lake. The area around this location includes [...] "heavily forested areas, sand plains and scrub growth among the rock outcrops". The next stop is the Dune Overlook and Picnic Mountain picnic area. From this vantage point, tourists can view both North and South Manitou islands, also part of the park, as well as Pyramid Point and Sleeping Bear Bay. As the drive approaches this stop and the fourth, the Cottonwood Trail, it emerges from the forest into the sandy dune area next to Lake Michigan. Several more stops are noted in the guide before Pierce Stocking Scenic <b>Drive</b> <b>heads</b> back inland through the beech and maple forest.|$|E

2500|$|The {{overlap with}} both US6 and the PIP lasts for just [...] as Seven Lakes Drive leaves the PIP {{at the next}} junction, a trumpet {{interchange}} southwest of Bear Mountain. Seven Lakes <b>Drive</b> <b>heads</b> eastward from the interchange, running along the southern base of the large mountain as it intersects with several trails and passes seamlessly into the adjacent Bear Mountain State Park. Just east of the park boundary, the highway crosses the county line once again, re-entering Rockland County near its northernmost point. At the southeastern edge of Bear Mountain, Seven Lakes Drive begins to descend a series of switchbacks as it enters the Hudson River valley. The road gradually makes {{its way to the}} western edge of the river, where it ends at an intersection with US9W and US202 due east of Bear Mountain's and just south of the Bear Mountain Bridge.|$|E

50|$|On the Commodore 64, several {{methods were}} used to protect {{software}}. For software distributed on ROM cartridges, subroutines were included which attempted to write over the program code. If the software was on ROM, nothing would happen, but if the software had been moved to RAM, the software would be disabled. Because of the operation of Commodore floppy drives, one write protection scheme would cause the floppy <b>drive</b> <b>head</b> to bang against {{the end of its}} rail, which could cause the <b>drive</b> <b>head</b> to become misaligned. In some cases, cracked versions of software were desirable to avoid this result. A misaligned <b>drive</b> <b>head</b> was rare usually fixing itself by smashing against the rail stops. Another brutal protection scheme was grinding from track 1 to 40 and back a few times.|$|R

5000|$|PrairieTek was a {{hard drive}} {{manufacturer}} located in Longmont, Colorado in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It manufactured 5 and 10 megabyte [...] "ruggedized" [...] miniature hard drives for the laptop computer market. Unlike many manufacturers of the time, PrairieTek did not rest the <b>drive</b> <b>heads</b> on the disks, but instead used reverse EMF to park the drives on a spreader bar. While the concept promised {{to reduce the amount}} of wear on the <b>drive</b> <b>heads</b> and the disk, in practical application the heads came off the spreader bar too fast, and before the disk had come up to speed (creating an air cushion), which led to the heads impacting the disks and knocking loose magnetic media, shortening the life of the drive to months or weeks.|$|E

50|$|The floppy {{drive of}} the Commodore Amiga {{personal}} computer {{could be made}} to produce noises of various pitches by making the <b>drive</b> <b>heads</b> move back and forth.

50|$|The sector {{lists are}} also stored on various chips {{attached}} to the PCB, and they are unique to each hard disk drive.
