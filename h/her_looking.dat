5|$|Only {{two of the}} disc's 11 tracks {{attempt a}} genuine {{expression}} of vulnerability. Just one, 'Blank Page,' finds <b>her</b> <b>looking</b> inside and taking some blame. It's a pretty song, if one that blatantly rides Adele's coattails. Not only does 'Page' employ the same piano/voice arrangement as that star's 'Someone Like You,' Aguilera apes the precise length of Adele's notes.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi. It opens with Hamasaki watching her previous music videos on several television screens. Sitting in a small room, she exits it and finds {{a large amount of}} fans and paparazzi bombarding her; scenes interspersed through the main plot feature <b>her</b> <b>looking</b> towards a mirror. Following the first chorus, Hamasaki is shown riding through Tokyo city, including her appearance at a recording studio singing the song, and on top of a skyscraper at night. The frames subsequently re-appear throughout the visual, with it ending with a blurry shot of Hamasaki looking away from the mirror, and the TV screens from the first shot displaying the logo of Avex Trax. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016). It was additionally used as the theme for Japanese television show Semi Double (1999).|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Ryder {{appeared}} in two movies, filmed before her arrest. The {{first was a}} romantic comedy titled Mr. Deeds with Adam Sandler. This was her most commercially successful movie to date, earning over $126 million in the United States alone. The film was not a critical success, however; film critic Philip French {{described it as a}} terrible film, saying that [...] "remakes are often bad, but this one was particularly bad." [...] The second film was the science fiction drama Simone in which she portrayed a glamorous star who is replaced by a computer simulated actress due to the clandestine machinations of a director, portrayed by <b>her</b> <b>Looking</b> for Richard costar Al Pacino.

500|$|The visual commences with {{shots of}} a black-haired Stan on a swing, with her being {{subsequently}} {{presented at the}} aforementioned port wearing black clothing along with a grey cap and white shoes.

After the latter's rap verse, the singer further dances to the song in the colorful smoke of a firework before the music video ends with <b>her</b> <b>looking</b> in the camera. Jonathan Currinn from music website Celebmix was positive towards [...] "9 Lives", stating about its music video that is a [...] "pure performance piece, with Alexandra Stan bringing some serious performance vibes". He further noticed the singer's appearance in the visual to emphasize the track's message.

500|$|The cover art to [...] "Free Free"/"Super Music Maker" [...] {{was photographed}} by Takashiro Akihisa, who also {{directed}} the accompanying music video for the song, and was revealed on July 18, 2007. There are three different artworks; the normal CD cover featured Suzuki kneeling down, whilst the DVD had her bending {{down with her}} back towards the camera. The artworks {{were placed on the}} back of the jewelcases, and the booklet featured another shot of <b>her</b> <b>looking</b> upwards; when opened, her bottom half is shown on the other side of the book. Additionally, Avex printed the booklets in a special lenticular paper that imitated the LED lights in the background of the photoshoot. This shot was then used as the official vinyl cover, tinted in pink. Taken from the video shoot, an editor for the website Sanspo compared the art to the work of Japanese recording artist Kumi Koda, where he/she described the shoot as [...] "sexy". Another reviewer, reporting from Natalie.mu, commended its [...] "decorative" [...] lights and felt it expressed the songs [...] "technopop" [...] style.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club gave the episode an A {{and called it}} [...] "generally a terrific episode". Handlen wrote that he was [...] "delighted to get another Scully-centric episode [...] one that doesn't end up with <b>her</b> <b>looking</b> pale and deathly in a hospital bed." [...] Despite his approval of the script, he slightly criticized the series for writing Scully-centric episodes {{based solely on the}} idea that [...] "something is being done to her" [...] as opposed to against or with her. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode an 8 out of 10, and wrote [...] "Overall, this episode was an interesting and uncommon in-depth look at Scully's psychology. The writers rarely had such an opportunity, and along with Gillian Anderson, they run with the opportunity. The religious metaphor is a bit thick throughout, but this is actually a bit more subtle than would become the norm. Making the child sick works for the mythology, but in a lot of ways, it seems like a plot contrivance." ...|$|E

[...] Andrew Leonard of Salon described the episode as the [...] "disco lesbian vampire" [...] episode and stated that it provided [...] "tacit consent to a lesbian reading of the Xena-Gabrielle relationship." [...] A DVD Town reviewer felt that the general lesbian eroticism in Xena: Warrior Princess was [...] "amped up" [...] in this episode, noting Gabrielle's [...] "sexy clothes" [...] and <b>her</b> <b>looking</b> at Xena with [...] "hungry eyes". Heather Findlay of Girlfriends magazine itemized several scenes with a lesbian subtext. [...] Gabrielle wandering into an all-female bar ("wink-wink"), becoming a vampire ("apparently Friedman studied that topos in her women's studies classes"), and [...] "kissing" [...] Xena ("oh, wait, that was a bite").

500|$|On June 6, 2010, Aguilera {{performed}} [...] "Bionic" [...] for {{the first}} time at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards, held at Gibson Amphitheatre in Los Angeles, California.

During the performance of [...] "Bionic", she sported curly platinum hair and was dressed in a [...] "diamond-encrusted one-piece" [...] while sitting on a [...] "gilded throne". Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone opined that the way Aguilera began the performance was similar to Madonna during the latter's Sticky & Sweet Tour (200809). Then, Aguilera walked on the stage and [...] "leather-clad" [...] back-up dancers in silver and black outfits began to perform a dance routine. The performance was met with mainly negative reviews and failed to gain impact from media outlets. Tamar Anitai for MTV Buzzworthy was not impressed toward her performance, summarizing it [...] "was all about her [...] "I-I'm-still-a-diva" [...] vocals, frenzied stage show, and adult-only innuendo...

In a positive view, James Montgomery for MTV News praised <b>her</b> <b>looking</b> as [...] "a 23rd-century queen" [...] and the show [...] "got millions of people all hot and bothered".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Illegal" [...] {{was shot in}} Mexico City on 17 October 2006, during a short break in the {{schedule}} of the Oral Fixation Tour, between concerts in Mexico and Guatemala. Jaume de Laiguana and Shakira were the co-directors of the video. The filming took a full day, and some American and Mexican fans were invited over as extras. It officially premiered on 16 November 2006 on MTV's Total Request Live (TRL). The video features Shakira as the girlfriend of a boxer. Throughout most of the video, she {{is shown in the}} empty boxing venue where her former boyfriend boxes. Through flashbacks, she remembers the good times in their relationship - including being alone in the ring, affectionately treating each other. At the end of the video, the reason behind their break-up is shown. Shakira comes to see her boyfriend boxing in the championship match where he wins, unaware that Shakira is there watching him. Another girl steps in the ring and kisses the boxer, revealing to Shakira he is cheating on her. Her boyfriend, to his shock, finally sees that Shakira is watching him kiss the other girl. The video ends with <b>her</b> <b>looking</b> back at him, clearly hurt, before turning away and leaving.|$|E
500|$|After Christopher Eccleston's {{departure}} from the series' lead role, Davies was eager to include elements of the 2005 season in David Tennant's Christmas Day introductory episode to reassure viewers discomforted by the change of lead actor. To this end he and producer Phil Collinson secured the return of Wilton's character in her capacity as Prime Minister. In the dénouement of [...] "The Christmas Invasion" [...] the character's government is brought down by the new Doctor after she orders Torchwood to shoot down a fleeing alien ship. Davies remarks that as Prime Minister Jones is [...] "out of her depth" [...] and [...] "does the wrong thing"; he intended her downfall to reflect the episode's anti-war message. Producer Julie Gardner felt the end sequence [...] "added so much of another layer" [...] to the episode. Collinson mentioned on the DVD commentary for the episode that he [...] "tried so hard" [...] to get Davies to change the ending; he felt the Doctor would forgive her because [...] "he would understand" [...] her decision. Collinson also felt that Harriet's downfall {{could be seen as}} a [...] "hark to Thatcher" [...] as one of Thatcher's aides had reportedly stated <b>her</b> <b>looking</b> tired; Davies acknowledged a parallel with events in Whitehall and felt the script underlined the power of rumours. He also [...] " [...] the fact that I feel sad" [...] because of the character's political demise. In his column in Doctor Who Magazine Davies explains his intention that by the Doctor ending Jones's career early, a [...] "gap" [...] was created in history that the Master (John Simm) was then able to exploit and become Prime Minister. He had originally planned to allude to this in the script, but it was cut when he realised that the Doctor was already burdened by enough guilt.|$|E

500|$|Yar's {{death in}} the episode was after Crosby had asked to be let out of her contract, and rumors had {{circulated}} of her departure. She later described her time spent on Star Trek: The Next Generation as [...] "miserable", and it was well known {{at the time that}} she was unhappy with the way her role had been developed. She later said that if she'd had more scenes written for her similar to the one she shared with Worf {{at the start of the}} episode then she wouldn't have wanted to leave the show. Yar's memorial scene was filmed twice, the first was with Crosby reciting the lines while looking straight ahead, which was the director's preferred choice. However a version with <b>her</b> <b>looking</b> towards each of the other characters in turn was ultimately used. Scanlan later said [...] "Don't ask me how she knew where they'd be standing". Marina Sirtis's tears in the scene were real, as she was cued by Crosby standing off camera. [...] "Skin of Evil" [...] was not the last episode in the first season in which Denise Crosby appeared. [...] "" [...] was subsequently filmed after this episode, but was aired earlier in the run. In fact, toward the end of [...] "Symbiosis" [...] you can see Crosby waving goodbye to the fans (it is the scene where Picard and Crusher leave the cargo bay). Crosby would also later return to the Yar role in [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise", the two part series finale [...] "" [...] and as Yar's half-Romulan daughter Sela in several episodes. Guest stars in [...] "Skin of Evil" [...] included Walker Boone as Leland T. Lynch, Brad Zerbst as a nurse and Raymond Forchion as Ben Prieto. Even though this episode marked the death of Yar, Crosby would be credited for the remaining three first season episodes.|$|E
