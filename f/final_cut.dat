5|$|Recorded {{in eight}} British studios from July to December 1982, with an {{accompanying}} short film {{released in the}} same year, production of The <b>Final</b> <b>Cut</b> was dominated by interpersonal conflict. Although it {{reached the top of}} the UK Albums Chart, the album received mixed reviews. Waters left the band in 1985, and The <b>Final</b> <b>Cut</b> thus remains the last Pink Floyd studio album he worked on.|$|E
5|$|According to Lyne's audio commentary, test {{screenings}} {{indicated that}} the initial version of the film was overwhelming for the audience. In response, about 20 minutes of disturbing scenes, mostly from {{the last third of}} the film, were removed from the <b>final</b> <b>cut.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carice van Houten {{was cast}} as Roger's wife Gretchen Ferris, but all her scenes were deleted {{and she does}} not appear in the <b>final</b> <b>cut.</b>|$|E
50|$|Chambers re-signed {{with the}} Bills in March 2009. He was {{released}} during <b>final</b> <b>cuts</b> on September 5, {{only to be}} re-signed three days later after offensive tackle Langston Walker was released. He was again released during the <b>final</b> <b>cuts</b> on September 4, 2010.|$|R

5|$|During the eight-month period, Beyoncé {{recorded}} over seventy {{songs and}} decided during the editing process {{that she did}} not want to reconcile the two approaches into one disc. If a song was meaningless to her, she cut them off during the process of elimination for the final track listing. After a process of elimination, twelve tracks were selected to be placed on the standard edition of the album, while five additional tracks were chosen to make the <b>final</b> <b>cut</b> for the deluxe edition of the album. Beyoncé later revealed that songs from established producers like The Neptunes and Danja were not able to make the <b>final</b> <b>cut.</b>|$|E
5|$|Maben {{subsequently}} {{did some}} of the editing of the <b>final</b> <b>cut</b> at home, due to financial constraints. He regretted doing this, as he felt it was important to separate his work and home life, but, at the time, he had no choice.|$|E
5|$|Naomi Scott {{was cast}} as Ryoko. She filmed her scenes {{but they were}} removed from the <b>final</b> <b>cut.</b> The scenes were {{included}} only in the DVD extended version.|$|E

5|$|Padayappas initial <b>final</b> <b>cut</b> {{lasted for}} 22 reels, which was {{considered}} too lengthy. Rather than cut the film, Rajinikanth suggested to Ravikumar to allot two intervals for the film. Ravikumar was wary of this idea, {{and went to}} actor Kamal Haasan for advice, since the initial <b>final</b> <b>cut</b> of Haasan's Nayakan (1987) was also 22 reels. Using his prior experience on trimming Nayakan, Haasan was able to cut Padayappa down to 16 reels. When Kumudams reporter Kannan asked Rajinikanth to release the scenes which had been cut as Padayappas sequel, Rajinikanth immediately spoke to Ravikumar about the possibility, but was informed that those reels had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{versions}} of Blade Runner {{exist as a}} result of controversial changes made at the request of studio executives. A director's cut was released in 1992 after a strong response to test screenings of a workprint. This, in conjunction with the film's popularity as a video rental, made it one of the first movies to be released on DVD. In 2007, Warner Bros.released The <b>Final</b> <b>Cut,</b> a 25th-anniversary digitally remastered version, and the only version over which Scott retained artistic control. The <b>Final</b> <b>Cut</b> was shown in selected theaters and released on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray.|$|E
5|$|So many {{sequences}} {{from the}} film were removed, that several well-known actors never appeared in the <b>final</b> <b>cut,</b> including Ian Hendry (as 006, the agent whose body is briefly seen being disposed of by Vesper), Mona Washbourne and Arthur Mullard.|$|E
50|$|Taylor was {{released}} by Chicago during <b>final</b> <b>cuts</b> on September 3, 2011.|$|R

5|$|A scene between Skinner and The Smoking Man {{was removed}} from the <b>final</b> <b>cut</b> due to time considerations, {{reducing}} his role in the episode to a very short dialogue-less appearance. Another scene where Mulder questions Skinner's allegiance was also removed when it was viewed as too combative. The episode title means the incarnation of a deity in Sanskrit.|$|E
5|$|Anthony LaPaglia {{was cast}} as Al Capone and filmed a single scene, which was {{omitted from the}} <b>final</b> <b>cut,</b> {{and can be found}} in the DVD's deleted scenes. Mendes {{believed}} that Capone was more menacing as an unseen presence. Actor Alfred Molina was approached to portray Capone, but Molina was forced to turn the role down due to scheduling conflicts with Frida (2002).|$|E
5|$|Harvie Krumpet was {{edited by}} Bill Murphy {{for eight days}} spread over several weeks. The {{original}} cut of 45–50 minutes of footage {{was reduced to a}} <b>final</b> <b>cut</b> of less than 23 minutes. Over 2000 sound clips were added during the sound design process and the film was converted to 35 mm film in May 2003.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, an {{extended}} cut {{was released on}} VHS and premiered on the ABC television network. It added roughly 12minutes to the film. The added footage was largely unfinished, and cobbled together for the network premiere; Wise hadn't wanted some of the footage {{to be included in}} the <b>final</b> <b>cut</b> of the film. This version was released by Paramount in late 1983 on VHS, Betamax, and Laserdisc.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{was already}} under way in January 2005, when Baron Cohen caused a near riot in what would ultimately be the rodeo scene in the <b>final</b> <b>cut</b> of the film. An interview with Baron Cohen by Rolling Stone indicated that more than 400 hours of footage had been shot for the film.|$|E
5|$|Renoir {{edited the}} film while shooting; his first cut was three hours long. He and editor Marguerite {{completed}} a 113-minute <b>final</b> <b>cut</b> {{of the film}} in July 1939. Jay hated it and demanded that Renoir make cuts, including the excision of Renoir's entire performance as Octave. Renoir refused to completely omit Octave but agreed to remove 13 minutes from the film.|$|E
50|$|Graham was waived by the Eagles on August 30, 2008 during <b>final</b> <b>cuts.</b>|$|R

50|$|Marcus Smith was {{released}} by Baltimore during <b>final</b> <b>cuts</b> on September 3, 2011.|$|R
5|$|Seventy {{minutes of}} footage, mostly {{dealing with the}} origin, were not {{included}} in the <b>final</b> <b>cut.</b> Much of this back-story was unscripted and the filmmakers were never sure of including it into the <b>final</b> <b>cut,</b> and had considered releasing some of these clips on the internet. Editor Kyle Cooper, creator of the Marvel logo (with the flipping pages) and the montage detailing Iron Man's biography in that film, edited together much of this footage into the opening credits. Leterrier explained a negative test screening, where flashbacks were placed across the film that the audience found too similar to Hulk, had resulted in compressing these to the film's start. This replaced the original opening, where Banner comes to the Arctic to commit suicide. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of Captain America is partially seen in the ice. Leterrier said he did not want this scene to be lost amid the opening montage.|$|E
5|$|Stone had a love scene {{removed from}} the <b>final</b> <b>cut</b> of The Quick and the Dead before the film's release in the United States. The actress/co-producer thought the scene did not {{fit in with the}} picture's {{established}} reality. It was restored for the home cinema releases of the film.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Final</b> <b>Cut</b> is {{the twelfth}} studio album by the English {{progressive}} rock band Pink Floyd, released on 21 March 1983 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and on 2 April by Columbia Records in the United States. It was Pink Floyd's last studio album to include founding member, bass guitarist and songwriter Roger Waters, and their only album {{on which he}} alone is credited for writing and composition. It was also the only Pink Floyd album that does not feature keyboardist Richard Wright. Waters originally planned The <b>Final</b> <b>Cut</b> as a soundtrack album for the 1982 film Pink Floyd – The Wall. With {{the onset of the}} Falklands War, he rewrote it as a concept album, exploring what he considered the betrayal of his father, who died serving in the Second World War. Waters sings most of the lyrics; lead guitarist David Gilmour provides lead vocals on only one track. The packaging, also designed by Waters, reflects the album's war theme.|$|E
