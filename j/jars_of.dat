5|$|From 1932 to 1934, Spedding {{worked for}} Lewis as a {{chemistry}} instructor. Around this time, he {{became interested in}} the chemistry of the rare earths. These were expensive and hard to find, and generally available only in minute amounts. In 1933 he won the Irving Langmuir Award for most outstanding young chemist. The award came with a cash prize of $1,000. He borrowed money to travel to Chicago to collect it. While he was there, he was approached by a man offering several pounds of Europium and Samarium. His benefactor was Herbert Newby McCoy, a retired chemistry professor from the University of Chicago, who had obtained a supply of these elements from the Lindsey Light and Chemical Company, where they were a byproduct of thorium production. A few weeks later, Spedding received a package in the mail containing <b>jars</b> <b>of</b> the metals.|$|E
5|$|Michigan State's {{campus was}} among the first to serve as a botanical {{laboratory}} for its faculty and students and is the site of what is, today, the oldest continuously operated botanical garden in the US. In December 1879, Professor William J. Beal buried seeds of 23 common plants in 20 <b>jars</b> <b>of</b> sand (to prevent water accumulation) in various locations around campus. At certain fixed intervals, currently every 20 years, a jar is dug up to determine which seeds still germinate after their prolonged periods of unlit isolation. The most recent jar exhumation, April 2000, found only a few specimens surviving to germinate, notably Verbascum blattaria (moth mullein), after 120 years. Five buried jars remain, with the next unearthing scheduled for 2020.|$|E

In the UK, Sap and <b>Jar</b> <b>of</b> Flies were issued as a double CD, as Sap had not previously had a UK release.|$|R

[...] Instantly the Demon {{did as he was}} commanded; and of all the treasure that he had, the Wise Man took nothing with him but a <b>jar</b> <b>of</b> golden money and a <b>jar</b> <b>of</b> silver money. As soon as the Wise Man stood upon the ground of India, he drew from beneath his robe a little <b>jar</b> <b>of</b> glass.|$|R
5|$|The {{instruments}} of the Passion were sometimes split between a shield and crest {{in the form}} of an achievement of arms (Neubecker, 222). The Hyghalmen Roll (c. 1447–1455) shows Christ holding an azure shield charged with Veronica's Veil proper. The heraldry continues with the 15th century jousting helmet, which is covered by the seamless robe as a form of mantling, and the Cross, scepter (of mockery) and flagellum (whip) as crest. The banner's long red schwenkel is a mark of eminence in German heraldry, but it was omitted when this image was copied into Randle Holme's Book (c. 1464–1480). The image on the opposing page (shown above) includes a shield quartered with the five Wounds of Christ, three <b>jars</b> <b>of</b> ointment, two rods, and the head of Judas Iscariot with a bag of money (Dennys, 97–98).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Jar</b> <b>of</b> Fools {{was one of}} Jason Lutes's first {{mainstream}} successes, earning him {{praise from}} many publications. Chris Ware, {{one of the most}} popular alternative comics writers, said <b>of</b> <b>Jar</b> <b>of</b> Fools: [...] "Reading <b>Jar</b> <b>of</b> Fools is like getting a slow motion punch in the face. There’s plenty of time to get out of the way, but something compels you to wait and find out if it’s actually going to hurt as much when it hits. And, of course, it does." [...] Will Shetterly and Emma Bull picked <b>Jar</b> as one <b>of</b> the two best graphic novels of 1994, describing it as [...] "an astonishingly mature work." ...|$|R

25|$|<b>Jars</b> <b>of</b> Clay's eponymous first {{full-length}} {{album is}} characterized by a combination of drum loops and acoustic guitar strumming that would become an early trademark of the band. Strings are also used prominently in most of the songs. Honest, intense, poetic, and harmonic with sonic influences as diverse as Gregorian chants, mandolin, and gothic layered vocals, <b>Jars</b> <b>of</b> Clay was a refreshing break from the pessimism and alterna-angst that dominated the mid-90s music scene.|$|E
