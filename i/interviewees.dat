50|$|They {{define the}} {{three kinds of}} content as follows - {{situational}} content was described as interview questions that get information on how the <b>interviewee</b> would behave in specific situations presented by the interviewer. For example, a question that asks whether the <b>interviewee</b> would choose to report a coworker for behaving in an unethical way or just let them go. Job related questions, on the other hand, assess the <b>interviewee's</b> past behavior and job-related information. While psychological interviews include questions intended to assess the <b>interviewee's</b> personality traits such as their work ethic, dependability, honesty etc.|$|R
50|$|Each {{interview}} {{is accompanied by}} still shots of photos of family members and friends, places of importance for the <b>interviewee</b> and of other items or documents of special significance in the <b>interviewee’s</b> life.|$|R
5|$|The film deconstructs the church's {{claims by}} {{presenting}} a condensed history of Scientology and its founder, L. Ron Hubbard, examining how celebrities {{interact with the}} church, and highlighting the stories {{of a number of}} ex-members and of the abuse and exploitation that they described seeing and experiencing. The Church of Scientology responded vehemently to the film, complaining to film critics about their reviews and denouncing the filmmakers and their <b>interviewees.</b>|$|E
5|$|The film {{features}} animation by American {{graphic designer}} and cartoonist Bill Plympton. To illustrate key concepts, Fuck uses sound bites, music, video clips and archival film footage; Anderson combined excerpts from five television series and twenty-two {{films in the}} documentary. The interviews were cut so that different subjects appear {{to be talking to}} each other; the <b>interviewees</b> in question generally had opposite views on the subject. The film was unrated by the Motion Picture Association of America.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-five media {{commentators}} {{were interviewed}} for the film. Jory Weitz helped obtain interviews; he had cast Anderson's previous film, The Big Empty, and had industry credibility as {{executive producer of}} Napoleon Dynamite. Anderson said he intended to select <b>interviewees</b> {{with a variety of}} perspectives, conservative as well as liberal. He described how, as confirmations of interview subjects came in, he was surprised when Pat Boone {{was among the first to}} confirm his participation. Anderson had previously worked as a cameraman on a piece with Boone about eight years before starting work on Fuck. After confirming Boone, Bill Maher and Janeane Garofalo on Fuck, it became easier for Anderson to confirm other <b>interviewees.</b> The film included the final video interview with Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide, and Anderson dedicated it to Thompson for his contributions to journalism.|$|E

5000|$|The {{interpretation}} {{is seen in}} some approaches as co-created by not only the interviewer but also {{with help from the}} <b>interviewee,</b> as the researcher uses the interpretation given by the <b>interviewee</b> while also constructing their own meaning from the narrative.|$|R
40|$|<b>Interviewee</b> {{impression}} {{management has}} been a long-standing concern in the interview literature. Yet recent insights into the impact of impression management on <b>interviewee</b> performance in structured interviews suggest that <b>interviewee</b> impression management {{may be more than}} just a source of bias and a nuisance. Rather, impression management should possess construct-related validity and contribute to the interviews' criterion-related validity. These hypotheses were tested with 129 participants using a simulated selection interview aimed at university graduates. Results confirmed most of the hypotheses. In particular, <b>interviewee</b> impression management behavior showed construct-related validity across different structured interview types and correlated positively with interviewees' performance on subsequent typical and maximum performance proxy criteria. Implications and directions for future research are discussed...|$|R
5|$|A {{subsequent}} poll by The Straits Times {{found that}} while many Singaporeans knew what the anthem generally meant, only seven out of 35 persons interviewed knew the meaning of each word. However, all but three of those interviewed agreed that the anthem {{should continue to be}} sung in Malay. The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English because that was the language most commonly used in Singapore. All the <b>interviewees,</b> including those who did not know the meaning of the lyrics, said they felt a sense of pride when they heard or sang the national anthem.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its range, {{the giant}} otter interacts with {{indigenous}} groups, who often practice traditional hunting and fishing. A study of five indigenous communities in Colombia suggests native {{attitudes toward the}} animal are a threat: the otters are often viewed as a nuisance that interferes with fishing, and are sometimes killed. Even when told {{of the importance of}} the species to ecosystems and the danger of extinction, <b>interviewees</b> showed little interest in continuing to coexist with the species. Schoolchildren, however, had a more positive impression of the animal.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey of}} 1000 {{secondary}} school pupils and university students in Tayside conducted in February 2010 found 20% {{of them had}} previously taken mephedrone. Although {{at the time it}} was available legally over the internet, only 10% of users reported purchasing it online, with most purchasing it from street dealers. Of those who had used mephedrone, 97% said it was easy or very easy to obtain. Around 50% of users reported at least one negative effect associated with the use of mephedrone, of which teeth grinding is the most common. Detailed interviews with users in Northern Ireland similarly found that few purchased mephedrone online, with most <b>interviewees</b> citing concerns that their address would be traced or that family members could intercept the package.|$|E

5|$|Correspondent {{segments}} {{feature a}} rotating supporting cast, and involve the show's members travelling to different locations to file comedic reports on current news stories and conduct interviews with people {{related to the}} featured issue. Topics have varied widely; {{during the early years}} of the show they tended toward character-driven human interest stories such as Bigfoot enthusiasts. Since Stewart began hosting in 1999, the focus of the show has become more political and the field pieces have come to more closely reflect current issues and debates. Under Kilborn and the early years of Stewart, most <b>interviewees</b> were either unaware or not entirely aware of the comedic nature of The Daily Show. However, as the show began to gain popularity—particularly following its coverage of the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections—most of the subjects now interviewed are aware of the comedic element.|$|E
5|$|Otaku often {{participate}} in self-mocking through the production or interest in humor directed at their subculture. Anime and manga otaku {{are the subject}} of numerous self-critical works, such as Otaku no Video, which contains a live-interview mockumentary that pokes fun at the otaku subculture and includes Gainax's own staff as the <b>interviewees.</b> Other works depict otaku subculture less critically, such as Genshiken and Comic Party. A well-known novel-cum-manga-cum-anime is Welcome to the N.H.K., which focuses on the subcultures popular with otaku and highlights other social outcasts such as the hikikomori and NEETs. Works that focus on an otaku character include WataMote, the story of an unattractive and unsociable otome game otaku who exhibits delusions about her social status. Watamote is a self-mocking insight that follows the heroine's delusion and attempts to reform herself only by facing reality with comedic results on the path to popularity. An American documentary, Otaku Unite!, focuses on the American side of the otaku culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{programming}} on C-SPAN3 from Monday through Friday features uninterrupted live {{public affairs}} events, in particular political events from Washington, D.C. Each weekend since January 8, 2011, {{the network has}} broadcast 48 hours of programming dedicated {{to the history of}} the United States, under the umbrella title American History TV. The programming covers the history of the U.S. from the founding of the nation through the late 20th century. Programs include American Artifacts, which is dedicated to exploring museums, archives and historical sites, and Lectures in History, featuring major university history professors giving lectures on U.S. history. In 2009, C-SPAN3 aired an eight-installment series of interviews from the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas, which featured historian Richard Norton Smith and Vice President Walter Mondale, among other <b>interviewees.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ben Neal of the Tennessee Librarian {{questioned}} King's {{heavy use}} of Works Progress Administration-collected interview material, {{noting that the}} <b>interviewees</b> were too old to thoughtfully recall and express the complete spectrum of slave childhood. He then absolved King of fault for the otherwise dearth of data. Neal praised the book's accessibility for casual readers and academics alike. In The Journal of American Historys review of the first edition, Loren Schweninger commended King's restrained use of the WPA sources with Neal’s same rationale. Schweninger also sought more comparisons between Southern regions and in interracial relationships. Jane Turner Censer agreed that the book treated the South and century too broadly where it could have noticed specific differences due to migration patterns, regional changes, and time. Richard H. Steckel in The Georgia Historical Quarterly similarly desired comparison between slave and working class children of the era. Yet Roderick A. McDonald appreciated this broader perspective and emphasis on slave resilience and familial love in foil with two more negative and detailed, or narrower, studies (Them Dark Days by William Dusinberre and Life in Black and White by Brenda Stevenson) in his write-up for American Studies. Steckel added {{that he wanted to}} know more about the children's nutrition, and Marten felt several of King's smaller points were not fully substantiated.|$|E
25|$|The {{interviews}} highlight many intriguing {{aspects of}} the Japanese psyche. Work was a high, if not central, priority {{for most of the}} <b>interviewees.</b> Isolation, individualism, and lack of communication were also strong themes which were common throughout many accounts of the attacks. Many of the <b>interviewees</b> expressed disillusionment with the materialism in Japanese society and the sensationalistic media, as well as the inefficiency of the emergency response system in dealing with the attack.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{repeatedly}} that many people hold personality stereotypes of stutterers. The attitudes of psychotherapists regarding stutterers have never been investigated. The present investigation assessed {{the degree to which}} psychotherapists-in-training hold stereotypes of stutterers as compared to normally fluent speakers. Two groups viewed a videotaped vignette of a male. In one, the male <b>interviewee</b> displayed stuttering behaviors. In the other, the same male spoke fluently. Participants then rated the male <b>interviewee</b> on several personality dimensions. Contrary to previous findings, the group viewing the stuttering <b>interviewee</b> rated him no differently than did the group viewing the fluent <b>interviewee.</b> Greater knowledge of stuttering was associated with more positive ratings of the person who stuttered. The clinical and research implications of these findings are then discussed...|$|R
50|$|Example paradata topics about {{a survey}} include {{the times of}} day {{interviews}} were conducted, how long the interviews took, how many times there were contacts with each <b>interviewee</b> or attempts to contact the <b>interviewee,</b> the reluctance of the <b>interviewee,</b> and the mode of communication (such as phone, Web, email, or in person). Thus there are paradata about each observation in the survey. These attributes affect the costs and management of a survey, {{the findings of a}} survey, evaluations of interviewers, and inferences one might make about non-respondents.|$|R

25|$|The {{public library}} {{was one of}} the most {{important}} points of access for <b>interviewees,</b> along with the internet and bookstores. <b>Interviewees</b> often relied heavily on online library catalogs as safe, anonymous searches to explore lesbian fiction. Participants often did not find what they were looking for in online catalogs, but were not surprised by the lack of materials. Rothbauer suggests making materials more visible, and also improving the scope and currency of library holdings to reach these users.|$|E
