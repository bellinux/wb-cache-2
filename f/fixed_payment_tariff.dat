40|$|What {{determines the}} market value of a star? This paper {{examines}} the size of <b>fixed</b> <b>payments</b> to leading actors in the U. S. motion picture industry from a sample of contracts between 1959 and 1989. Competing explanations for the size of compensation, including rent capture, risk sharing, signalling, and portfolio optimization by studio executives are explored. The size of <b>fixed</b> <b>payment</b> across all contract types moves with an actor's history of participating in top- 20 grossing films over the past five, ten, fifteen, and twenty films. Further, the impact of past top- 20 successes is enhanced by the length of the actor's career. When contracts are divided into those with both <b>fixed</b> <b>payments</b> and share payments and those with only <b>fixed</b> <b>payments,</b> the <b>fixed</b> <b>payment</b> in two-part share contracts is influenced to some extent by risk concerns, in addition to the actor's star power. Fixed-payment-only contracts are most strongly influenced by measures of signalling and star power. Data on both types of contract provide strong support for the rent-capture theory: actors are paid rents upfront for the star value they add to the production.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal two-part pricing under cost uncertainty. We consider a risk-averse monopolistic firm that {{is subject to}} a cost shock to its constant marginal cost of production. The firm uses two-part pricing to sell its output to a continuum of heterogeneous consumers. We show that the global and marginal effects of risk aversion on the firm's optimal two-part pricing are to raise the unit price and lower the <b>fixed</b> <b>payment.</b> We further show that {{an increase in the}} fixed cost of production induces the firm to raise (lower) the unit price and lower (raise) the <b>fixed</b> <b>payment</b> under decreasing (increasing) absolute risk aversion. The firm's optimal two-part pricing is unaffected by changes in the fixed cost under constant absolute risk aversion. Finally, we show that a mean-preserving spread increase in cost uncertainty induces the firm to raise the unit price and lower the <b>fixed</b> <b>payment</b> under either decreasing or constant absolute risk aversion. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Empirical results for the Dutch potato marketing channel indicate that <b>fixed</b> <b>payments</b> to producers (agents) have decreased over time, even to negative levels, and the incentive intensity has approximately doubled.

5000|$|If {{the agent}} is risk-neutral {{and there are}} no bounds on {{transfer}} payments, the fact that the agent's effort is unobservable (i.e., it is a [...] "hidden action") does not pose a problem. In this case, the same outcome can be achieved that would be attained with verifiable effort: The agent chooses the so-called [...] "first-best" [...] effort level that maximizes the expected total surplus of the two parties. Specifically, the principal can give the realized output to the agent, but let the agent make a <b>fixed</b> up-front <b>payment.</b> The agent is then a [...] "residual claimant" [...] and will maximize the expected total surplus minus the <b>fixed</b> <b>payment.</b> Hence, the first-best effort level maximizes the agent's payoff, and the <b>fixed</b> <b>payment</b> can be chosen such that in equilibrium the agent's expected payoff equals his or her reservation utility (which is what the agent would get if no contract was written). Yet, if the agent is risk-averse, there is a trade-off between incentives and insurance. Moreover, if the agent is risk-neutral but wealth-constrained, the agent cannot make the <b>fixed</b> up-front <b>payment</b> to the principal, so the principal must leave a [...] "limited liability rent" [...] to the agent (i.e., the agent earns more than his or her reservation utility).|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of prospective payment systems in the adoption of new medical technologies across different countries. A literature review was conducted to provide background for the study and guide development of a survey instrument. The survey was disseminated to hospital payment systems experts in 15 jurisdictions. Fifty-one surveys were disseminated, with 34 returned. The surveys returned covered 14 of the 15 jurisdictions invited to participate. The majority (71 %) of countries update the patient classification system and/or <b>payment</b> <b>tariffs</b> {{on an annual basis}} to try to account for new technologies. Use of short-term separate or supplementary payments for new technologies occurs in 79 % of countries to ensure adequate funding and facilitate adoption. A minority (43 %) of countries use evidence of therapeutic benefit and/or costs to determine or update <b>payment</b> <b>tariffs,</b> although it is somewhat more common in establishing short-term payments. The main barrier to using evidence is uncertain or unavailable clinical evidence. Almost three-fourths of respondents believed diagnosis-related group systems incentivize or deter technology adoption, depending on the particular circumstances. Improvements are needed, such as enhanced strategies for evidence generation and linking evidence of value to payments, national and international collaboration and training to improve existing practice, and flexible timelines for short-term payments. Importantly, additional research is needed to understand how different payment policies impact technology uptake as well as quality of care and costs...|$|R

50|$|Water {{privatisation}} in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. In {{the federal}} capital territory of Kuala Lumpur {{and the state}} of Selangor, which completely surrounds the capital territory, a 26-year BOT contract for a 1,120 megaliter per day water treatment plant was signed with Puncak Niaga Holdings in 1994 as part of the Selangor River Water Supply Scheme. The contract included a commitment to invest US$760m. The state government provided a revenue guarantee to make the project financially viable. In 2004 a 30-year concession was awarded without competitive bidding to Syarikat Bekalan Air Selangor Sdn Bhd (SYABAS), a subsidiary of Puncak Niaga Holdings. The concession foresaw investment commitments of US$2.5 billion. It was supported by <b>fixed</b> government <b>payments,</b> since <b>tariffs</b> were too low to make the concession financially viable. The concession contract was signed by the federal government as well as the state government of Selangor. Both contracts were listed as “distressed” in 2010 pending a request of cancellation, according to the World Bank’s Private Participation in Infrastructure database. According to the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities, the utility did not recover its operating costs in 2007. Its revenues were equivalent to US$0.45/m3 and its operating costs were US$0.55/m3. Syabas claims US$281 million in compensation because the government did not increase tariffs, as it was foreseen in the concession agreement. The government argues that the company has not met its performance targets and has not disclosed all the information it was obliged to disclose. The state of Selangor has offered to buy back all water concessions in the state. After lengthy discussions about the price and after intervention by the federal government, three of four concessions in the State of Selangor (Syabas as well as PNSB, both owned by Puncak Niaga Holdings, and the smaller state-owned ABASS) were bought back in September 2014 for a price of reportedly €1.9 billion. Services will now be provided by Syarikat Air Selangor, the new state company to treat and distribute most of Selangor’s water, while assets will be owned by the Water Asset Management Company (WAMCO).|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this article is to examine the direct income {{compensation}} system from the viewpoint of production continuation and productivity improvement. The <b>fixed</b> <b>payment</b> part of the Farm Management Stabilization Program (FMSP) has had many problems. The <b>fixed</b> <b>payment</b> has inhibited productivity improvement. Because payments are based on past results they reinforce existing income disparities. Moreover, since the <b>fixed</b> <b>payment</b> program does not oblige the farmer to grow targeted crops, different crops are being produced, which runs counter the purpose of the subsidy and has therefore not been able to gain the support of those who bear the funding burden. The essence of the Individual-household Income Support System is to provide payments to cover shortfalls in farm income and is a return to the pre- 2006 system. Although many of shortcomings of the FMSP have been resolved, there are problems. Many of the disbursements are fixed amount grants to paddy rice farmers and because of a shortage of funding resources the production reduction target for sugar beets has been reduced. A reduction of the financial burden will be necessary to bring about a national agreement on agriculture supports. Therefore, there are increasing demands for improvements in productivity to reconcile the interests of farmers with those who must ultimately foot the bill for this program. 2010 年度秋季大会シンポジウム共通論題「政策転換下の北海道農業 : 政策対応と自立的な展開への条件...|$|R

40|$|Monetary {{incentives}} {{are used to}} encourage people to perform a variety of different actions. Increasingly, they are used to encourage actions that are directly beneficial to individuals, such as engaging in healthy behaviors or quitting addictive drugs. Interestingly, however, there is little research comparing the effectiveness of different types of incentive schemes. The current project compares the effectiveness of incentive schemes that offer sure payments versus lotteries of equal expected value. Specifically, two studies examine whether {{people are more likely to}} participate in a task if they are offered: (1) a <b>fixed</b> sure <b>payment,</b> (2) a lottery of equal expected value, or (3) a choice between the sure payment and lottery. We hypothesize that lotteries will be the most effective incentive and that a choice between a lottery and a <b>fixed</b> <b>payment</b> will be least effective. We then examine which incentive people are more likely to select, when presented with a choice between a lottery and a <b>fixed</b> <b>payment.</b> We hypothesize that, even though lotteries provide greater motivation, people will tend to select <b>fixed</b> <b>payments</b> over lotteries if given a choice. Study 1 addressed these questions in the context of a campus blood drive, and provided tentative evidence that people prefer either type of incentive (lottery vs. sure payment) over the choice of incentives. Study 2 examined whether participants are more motivated to complete a survey in exchange for a sure cash payment, a lottery, or a choice between a sure cash payment and a lottery. Results from these studies could have important implications for researchers and volunteering organizations, which seek to provide incentives for participants at the lowest cost to the organization...|$|R
