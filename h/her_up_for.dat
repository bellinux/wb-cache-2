5|$|All four ships saw major action {{during the}} war. Augsburg fired the first {{shots of the}} war against Russia on 2 August. Mainz and Cöln were sunk at the Battle of Heligoland Bight {{in the first month}} of the war. Kolberg saw action at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 and scored the first hits of the engagement. Both Kolberg and Augsburg participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, and Operation Albion in October 1917. After the end of the war, Kolberg was seized by France as a war prize and {{commissioned}} into the French Navy as Colmar; she served for only a few years and was scrapped in 1929. Augsburg was surrendered to Japan, which broke <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> scrap in 1922.|$|E

5|$|The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty was {{a mutual}} naval arms {{limitation}} and disarmament treaty between the five major naval {{powers of the}} time: the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Japan, Italy, and France. One of the main aspects of the treaty was the limitation on the number and size of capital ships each nation possessed; as the RAN was counted {{as part of the}} Royal Navy {{for the purposes of the}} treaty, Australia was one of the battlecruisers nominated for disposal to meet the British limit. The battlecruiser had to be made unusable for warlike activities within six months of the treaty's ratification, then disposed of by scuttling, as Australia did not have the facilities to break <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> scrap, and the British share of target ships was taken up by Royal Navy vessels. This was the only time the Australian military has been affected by a disarmament treaty until the 1997 Ottawa Treaty banning the use of anti-personnel mines.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} torpedoed twice by British submarines; the first, in July 1941, necessitated {{three months of}} repairs. The second, in August 1942, caused {{extensive}} damage and ended the ship's career. She was eventually towed back to La Spezia, where repairs were to be completed. Resources were unavailable, however, and Bolzano remained there, out of action. Plans to convert her into a hybrid cruiser-aircraft carrier came to nothing for the same reason. After Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943, La Spezia was occupied by German forces; {{to prevent them from}} using her as a blockship, Italian and British frogmen sank Bolzano using Chariot manned torpedoes in June 1944. The Italian Navy ultimately raised the ship in September 1949 and broke <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> scrap.|$|E
5|$|Between 1906–1908 and 1909–1910, {{the ship}} was rebuilt and {{equipped}} with more modern main guns. The 24cm guns were replaced with quick-firing 19cm L/42 guns manufactured by Skoda. Four 37mm Vickers revolving cannon were also installed. The ship's heavy fighting masts were removed. In 1912, {{the ship was}} sent to Salonika to safeguard Austro-Hungarian interests during the Balkan Wars. She was then assigned to the 1st Cruiser Division, and remained in that unit after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914. It consisted {{of the other two}} armored cruisers in the fleet, and three light cruisers, under the command of Vice Admiral Paul Fiedler. She was used as a harbor guard ship in Šibenik starting in 1914. In 1916, she was withdrawn from service and disarmed the following year for use as a barracks ship for German U-boat crews operating out of the Austrian naval base at Pola. Her guns were converted for use on land and sent to the Italian front. After the end of the war, in 1920, Kaiserin und Königin Maria Theresia was allocated to Britain as a war prize. The British sold her to an Italian ship-breaking firm, which broke <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> scrap.|$|E

Scully flashes back to a funeral she attended when she was a little girl but imagines Marshall Sim holding her hand. Scully insists on performing an autopsy on Roberta, thinking that she was murdered. Scully finds a needle puncture in Roberta's foot, causing her to believe that she was anesthetized and her suicide was staged. The police search the Sim's house and find a used hypodermic needle, which Marshall claims was used for injecting the anemic Emily with treatment. Scully spots the dark-suited men watching from a nearby car. Scully receives DNA data on Melissa, and matching it up to Emily's finds them nearly identical, causing her to believe that Emily is Melissa's daughter. Scully believes that Melissa gave birth to her while on the west coast and gave <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> adoption without ever telling the rest of the family. Scully flashes back to when she and Melissa were teenagers and were given cross necklaces from their mother for Christmas.|$|E

25|$|On December 3, Hill's family {{announced}} in a Facebook post {{that they had}} signed <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> in-home hospice care. A recent cutback in her steroids dosage, combined with further growth of her tumor, led to more severe symptoms. Three days later, the V Foundation for Cancer Research, founded by late college coach and broadcaster Jim Valvano in 1993 during his own losing fight with cancer, donated $100,000 to TCSN during halftime of the Jimmy V Women's Classic game between Connecticut and Notre Dame. A statement from Hill, taped at her home, was shown during the presentation. Despite her advancing cancer, {{she was able to}} leave hospice care to play in a third game on December 13, the Lions' first game of the season at the Harrington Center against Franklin College.
