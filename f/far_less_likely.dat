5|$|The {{increasing}} {{focus on}} Women's Rights in the United States during the 1980s {{focused attention on}} the fact that many drugs being prescribed for women had never actually been tested in women of child-bearing potential, and that there was a relative paucity of basic research into women's health. In response to this the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) in 1990 to address these inequities. In 1993 the National Institutes of Health Revitalisation Act officially reversed US policy by requiring NIH funded phase III clinical trials to include women. This resulted in an increase in women recruited into research studies. The next phase was the specific funding of large scale epidemiology studies and clinical trials focussing on women's health such as the Women's Health Initiative (1991), the largest disease prevention study conducted in the US. Its role was to study the major causes of death, disability and frailty in older women. Despite this apparent progress, women remain underepresented. In 2006 women accounted for less than 25% of clinical trials published in 2004, A follow up study by the same authors five years later found little evidence of improvement. Another study found between 10–47% of women in heart disease clinical trials, despite the prevalence of heart disease in women. Lung cancer {{is the leading cause of}} cancer death amongst women, but while the number of women enrolled in lung cancer studies is increasing, they are still <b>far</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to be enrolled than men.|$|E

5000|$|Based on {{previous}} {{work done by}} William S. Webb, William R. Perkins claims that spear-thrower weights, commonly called [...] "bannerstones," [...] and characterized by a centered hole in a symmetrically shaped carved or ground stone, shaped wide and flat with a drilled hole and thus {{a little like a}} large wingnut, are a rather ingenious improvement to the design that created a silencing effect when swung. The use of the device would reduce the telltale [...] "zip" [...] of a swung atlatl to a more subtle [...] "woof" [...] sound that did not travel as <b>far</b> and was <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to alert prey. Robert Berg's theory is that the bannerstone was carried by hunters as a spindle weight to produce string from natural fibers gathered while hunting, for the purpose of tying on fletching and hafting stone or bone points.|$|R

Using zipcode-level data on newspaper sales from the Audit Bureau of Circulations and internet penetration rates from the Current Population Survey (CPS), this paper documents that the internet has differentially attracted younger, more educated and more urban individuals away from daily newspapers. Higher internet penetration is not associated with lower newspaper sales among blacks and Hispanics, who thus <b>far</b> have been <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to connect. There is evidence that the internet has driven changes in coverage, with greater emphasis on local topics such as education and crime and on less time-sensitive areas such as investigative reporting...|$|R
25|$|Another cholera {{outbreak}} in 1865, which killed several hundred people, prompted {{the establishment of}} a Sanitary Commission for Gibraltar.

40|$|The {{consequences}} of future global climate variability for pastoralists are uncertain. The general picture {{is one of}} likely desiccation – of {{a decrease in the}} amount and predictability of rainfall, combined with an increase in evaporation caused by the warmer temperatures. One estimate is that, on present trends, the area affected by drought will double {{by the end of this}} century from 25 % to 50 %, and that while the number of drought periods may not significantly increase, they are likely to last for longer, making recovery (herd reconstitution, replenishment of water sources) less dependable. 1 This scenario is consistent with recent trends: the mean annual number of people killed and affected by drought in Eastern Africa, for example, has increased over ten-fold in the past thirty years, from 584 per 100, 000 people in 1974 - 78 to 6067 in 1999 - 2003. 2 However, these are global projections.

25|$|The {{difficulty}} in making confident attributions {{of work by}} Giorgione's hand dates from soon after his death, when some of his paintings were completed by other artists, and his considerable reputation also led to very early erroneous claims of attribution.

A study published in 1999 found that female adolescents who participated in sports were less likely than their non-athletic peers to engage in sexual activity and/or report a pregnancy.

25|$|The {{committee}} then submitted {{an updated}} version of the designation amendment to the House on October 23 that changed the number of candidates in a contingency election from five to three and allowed the Senate to choose the Vice President if there were a tie in that race. Small Federalist states disliked the change from five to three, because it made it <b>far</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> that a small-state candidate would make it to a contingency election. Huger and New York Federalist Gaylord Griswold argued that the Constitution was a compromise between large and small states and the method chosen by the Framers is supposed to check the influence of the larger states. Huger even asserted that the Constitution itself was not a union of people, but a union of large and small states in order to justify the original framework for electing the President. Designation, argued Griswold and Huger, would violate the spirit of the Constitution by taking away a check on the power of the large states.|$|E

The estimates demonstrate that covered union members report greater dissatisfaction even when accounting for sorting in both dimensions. Moreover, covered union members are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to quit holding job satisfaction constant and their quit behaviour is <b>far</b> <b>less</b> responsive to job satisfaction.

25|$|Socioeconomic factors {{significantly}} affect {{whether or not}} individuals develop the habit of voting. The most important socioeconomic factor affecting voter turnout is education. The more educated a person is, the more likely {{he or she is}} to vote, even controlling for other factors that are closely associated with education level, such as income and class. Income has some effect independently: wealthier {{people are more likely to}} vote, regardless of their educational background. There is some debate over the effects of ethnicity, race, and gender. In the past, these factors unquestionably influenced turnout in many nations, but nowadays the consensus among political scientists is that these factors have little effect in Western democracies when education and income differences are taken into account. However, since different ethnic groups typically have different levels of education and income, there are important differences in turnout between such groups in many societies. Other demographic factors have an important influence: young people are <b>far</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to vote than the elderly. Occupation has little effect on turnout, with the notable exception of higher voting rates among government employees in many countries.|$|E

In addition, children in joint custody arrangements report feeling closer to both parents than children in sole custody arrangements. Joint custody arrangements also appear to benefit the parents. Not only do parents in joint custody arrangements report lower levels of conflict with one another, when compared to those in sole custody arrangements, but joint custody is frequently related to more positive relationships, effective parenting, and lower inter-parental conflict; key factors that ensure a child’s well-being following divorce.
