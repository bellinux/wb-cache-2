50|$|Ropinirole (INN; {{trade names}} Requip, Repreve, Ronirol, Adartrel) is a {{dopamine}} agonist of the non-ergoline class of medications. It is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Cipla, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories and Sun Pharmaceutical. It {{is used in}} the treatment of Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome (RLS). Ropinirole is one of three medications approved by the FDA to treat RLS, the other two being pramipexole (Mirapex) and <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> (Horizant). The discovery of the drug's utility in RLS has been used as an example of successful drug repurposing.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of {{restless legs}} {{syndrome}} involves identifying the cause of symptoms when possible. The treatment process is designed to reduce symptoms, including decreasing the number of nights with RLS symptoms, the severity of RLS symptoms and nighttime awakenings. Improving {{the quality of life}} is another goal in treatment. This means improving overall quality of life, decreasing daytime sleepiness, and improving the quality of sleep. Pharmacologic treatment involves dopamine agonists or <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> as first line drugs for daily {{restless legs syndrome}}, and opioids for treatment of resistant cases. RLS drug therapy is not curative and has side effects such as nausea, dizziness, hallucinations, orthostatic hypotension, or daytime sleep attacks. An algorithm created by Mayo Clinic researchers provides guidance to the treating physician and patient, including non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments.|$|E
50|$|Gabapentinoids are a {{class of}} drugs that are {{derivatives}} of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) which block α2δ subunit-containing voltage-dependent calcium channels. This site {{has been referred to}} as the gabapentin receptor (α2δ subunit), as it is the target of the drugs gabapentin and pregabalin. Clinically-used gabapentinoids include gabapentin (Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica) as well as a gabapentin prodrug, <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> (Horizant). In addition, phenibut (Noofen) has been found to act as a gabapentinoid in addition to its primary mechanism of action. Another analogue mirogabalin is in clinical trials but has not yet been approved. Other compounds from this family used in research but not developed for medical use include atagabalin, 4-methylpregabalin and PD-217,014. Gabapentinoids are used clinically in the treatment of conditions including epilepsy, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, generalized anxiety disorder, and restless legs syndrome. Some off-label uses include migraine, social phobia, panic disorder, mania, bipolar disorder, and alcohol withdrawal.|$|E

Although <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> is a pro-drug of gabapentin, its pharmacokinetics differ. Absorption of <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> is more predictable, and inter-patient variability in bioavailability is lower than that of gabapentin.

The role of the drug in RLS treatment remains undefined, although it will likely be used as an alternative for refractory RLS when other treatments have failed.

40|$|Restless legs {{syndrome}} (RLS) is a sleep-related {{movement disorder}} {{with a high}} prevalence in the general population. Patients affected by a severe form of the disorder may develop comorbidities, such as psychological distress, cognitive dysfunction and cardiovascular diseases; these patients require pharmacotherapy. Dopamine agonists represent the first line treatment for RLS patients but, if adverse events such as compulsive behaviors and augmentation occur, the pharmacological approach should be modified. Gabapentin is a GABA analogue used {{in the treatment of}} seizures and pain syndromes. This drug has an unfavorable pharmacokinetic profile; the prodrug <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> was developed to overcome this limitation. Unlike oral gabapentin, <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> shows no evidence of saturation and exposure to gabapentin is dose proportional. The extended release formulation of <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> has the characteristics of an optimal drug therapy. Doses from 1200 to 1800 mg/day of <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> appear effective in treating RLS after only a few days of treatment. The most frequently reported adverse events associated with <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> are dizziness and somnolence, which are transient and of mild intensity.

40|$|Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a sleep-related {{movement}} disorder {{characterized by an}} urge to move the legs accompanied by unpleasant symptoms. Dopaminergic agents currently represent the first-line therapy for RLS. However, some patients are unable to continue with this pharmacological approach {{in the long term}} because of augmentation or other adverse events. Limited studies with the anticonvulsant/analgesic agent gabapentin have demonstrated that this drug might be useful in the treatment of primary and uremic RLS. Unfortunately, gabapentin has an unfavorable pharmacokinetic profile characterized by a dose-dependent bioavailability. <b>Gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil,</b> a prodrug of gabapentin, is currently being developed by XenoPort Inc/Astellas Pharma Inc/GlaxoSmithKline plc in order to overcome this limitation. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> provides a dose-proportional exposure to gabapentin when orally administered. <b>Gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> has proved to be beneficial in treating RLS symptoms in several phase II and III clinical trials.

40|$|Akito Kume 1, 21 KUME Clinic, 2 Nagoya Clinical Neuropharmacology Laboratory, Nagoya, JapanAbstract: <b>Gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> is a prodrug of the {{anticonvulsant}} gabapentin. The {{efficacy and}} safety of <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> {{for the treatment of}} moderate to severe primary restless legs syndrome (RLS) has been evaluated in several clinical trials in the United States and Japan. Although most clinical trials assessed <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> at doses greater than 600 mg/day and demonstrated the overall safety and efficacy (defined as improvements in the coprimary endpoints of the international RLS rating scale [IRLS] total score and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement response), the US Food and Drug Administration approved the 600 mg once-daily dosage because doses higher than 600 mg/day were considered to provide no additional benefits and were associated with higher rates of adverse events, such as somnolence and dizziness. Nonetheless, the results of clinical trials and post hoc meta-analyses have indicated that the 1, 200 mg once-daily dosage was the most validated <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> treatment for not only subjective RLS symptoms but also severe sleep disturbance associated with RLS. A Japanese dose-finding study showed that 900 mg/day, the intermediate dose between 600 and 1, 200 mg, failed to show a significant improvement in IRLS total score, probably because many of the patients who discontinued treatment did so early, suggesting that a half-landing dose may cause more adverse effects than favorable ones in some RLS patients early in the treatment. <b>Gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> may have two distinct therapeutic doses for the treatment of RLS: 600 mg/day or lower doses for the treatment of subjective RLS symptoms and 1, 200 mg/day or higher doses for the treatment of both subjective RLS symptoms and associated problems such as severe sleep disturbances.

40|$|Objective: A mixed {{treatment}} comparison (MTC) {{was performed to}} investigate the relative efficacy and safety of licensed pharmaceuticals for moderate-to-severe restless legs syndrome (RLS). Methods: RLS trials published over the past 10 years were identified via systematic literature searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and manufacturers' websites. MTC was performed with WinBUGS software using a Bayesian approach. Identified primary outcomes: change in International RLS Study Group Rating Scale (IRLS) at week 12 and end of maintenance (EoM). Secondary outcomes: IRLS and Clinical Global Impression - Improvement Scale (CGI-I) responders, RLS- 6 items and adverse events (AEs). Results: Twenty-eight clinical trials were identified. Fifteen {{were included in the}} primary analysis. Indirect comparisons were established among <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil,</b> pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine and placebo. Overall, the four active treatments showed similar efficacies as assessed by changes in IRLS scores, IRLS responders, CGI-I responders, and RLS- 6 scores. The sole exception was change in IRLS at week 12, for which rotigotine was likely more efficacious than ropinirole (mean difference: - 2. 52 [95 % CrI: - 4. 74, - 0. 40]). Indirect comparisons on safety endpoints indicated ropinirole was associated with a higher risk of nausea than the other agents, and was more likely to result in discontinuations due to lack of efficacy than pramipexole. Nausea was likely more frequent with pramipexole than <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil,</b> and rotigotine was more likely to result in discontinuation due to AEs than ropinirole and pramipexole. Conclusions: This MTC confirmed the superiority of <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil,</b> pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine above placebo in alleviating RLS symptoms. Compared to ropinirole, rotigotine showed some additional benefit in terms of change in IRLS at Week 12. Choice of RLS drugs requires careful evaluation of effectiveness and safety profiles in clinical practice. Due to lack of head-to-head trials, inconsistency could not be assessed in our analysis. Head-to-head trials on a more homogeneous population are needed to validate the MTC results...|$|E

40|$|Background: Since the {{publication}} of the first European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) guidelines in 2005 on the management of restless legs syndrome (RLS; also known as Willis-Ekbom disease), there have been major therapeutic advances in the field. Furthermore, the management of RLS is now a part of routine neurological practice in Europe. New drugs have also become available, and further randomized controlled trials have been undertaken. These guidelines were undertaken by the EFNS in collaboration with the European Neurological Society and the European Sleep Research Society. Objectives: To provide an evidence-based update of new treatments published since 2005 for the management of RLS. Methods: First, we determined what the objectives of management of primary and secondary RLS should be. We developed the search strategy and conducted a review of the scientific literature up to 31 December 2011 (print and electronic publications) for the drug classes and interventions employed in RLS treatment. Previous guidelines were consulted. All trials were analysed according to class of evidence, and recommendations made according to the 2004 EFNS criteria for rating. Recommendations: Level A recommendations can be made for rotigotine, ropinirole, pramipexole, <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil,</b> gabapentin and pregabalin, which are all considered effective for the short-term treatment for RLS. However, for the long-term treatment for RLS, rotigotine is considered effective, <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> is probably effective, and ropinirole, pramipexole and gabapentin are considered possibly effective. Cabergoline has according to our criteria a level A recommendation, but the taskforce cannot recommend this drug because of its serious adverse events. © 2012 EFNS.

40|$|Restless legs {{syndrome}} (RLS) is {{a common}} neurological disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs accompanied by uncomfortable sensations that occur at night or at time of rest. Pharmacological therapy {{should be limited to}} patients who suffer from clinically relevant symptoms. Chronic RLS is usually treated with either a dopamine agonist (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine) or an α 2 δ calcium-channel ligand (gabapentin, <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil,</b> pregabalin). Augmentation is the main complication of long-term dopaminergic treatment, and frequently requires a reduction of current dopaminergic dose or a switch to nondopaminergic medications. Opioids as monotherapy or add-on treatment should be considered when alternative satisfactory regimens are unavailable and the severity of symptoms warrants it. In a recent Phase III trial, oxycodone–naloxone prolonged release (PR) demonstrated a significant and sustained effect on patients with severe RLS inadequately controlled by previous treatments. The adverse-event profile was consistent with the safety profile of opioids. The most frequent adverse events were fatigue, constipation, nausea, headache, hyperhidrosis, somnolence, dry mouth, and pruritus. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. No cases of augmentation were reported. Oxycodone–naloxone PR is approved for the second-line symptomatic treatment of adults with severe to very severe idiopathic RLS after failure of dopaminergic treatment.

40|$|Abstract Background Because of the {{subjective}} nature of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) symptoms {{and the impact}} of these symptoms on sleep, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) play a prominent role as study endpoints in clinical trials investigating RLS treatments. The objective {{of this study was to}} validate a new measure, the Post Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ), to assess sleep dysfunction in subjects with moderate-to-severe RLS symptoms. Methods Pooled data were analyzed from two 12 -week, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil</b> (N = 540). At baseline and Week 12, subjects completed the PSQ and other validated health surveys: IRLS Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I), Profile of Mood States (POMS), Medical Outcomes Study Scale-Sleep (MOS-Sleep), and RLS-Quality of Life (RLSQoL). Pooled data were used post hoc to examine the convergent, divergent, known-group validity and the responsiveness of the PSQ. Results Convergent validity was demonstrated by significant correlations between baseline PSQ items and total scores of IRLS, POMS, RLSQoL, and the MOS-Sleep Scale (p ≤ 0. 007 each). Divergent validity was demonstrated through the lack of significant correlations between PSQ items and demographic characteristics. Correlations (p Conclusions Although these analyses were potentially limited by the use of clinical trial data and not prospective data from a study conducted solely for validation purposes, the PSQ demonstrated robust psychometric properties and is a valid instrument for assessing sleep and sleep improvements in subjects with moderate-to-severe RLS symptoms.

40|$|AbstractA Task Force was {{established}} by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) to develop evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations for the long-term pharmacologic treatment of restless legs syndrome/Willis–Ekbom disease (RLS/WED). The Task Force reviewed the results of all studies of RLS/WED treatments with durations of 6 months or longer presented at meetings over the past 2 years, posted on Web sites of pharmaceutical companies, or published in peer-reviewed journals, asking the questions, “What is the efficacy of this treatment in patients with RLS/WED?” and “What is the safety of this treatment in patients with RLS/WED?”The Task Force developed guidelines based on their review of 61 papers meeting inclusion criteria, and using a modified evidence-grading scheme. Pregabalin has been established as effective for up to 1 year in treating RLS/WED (Level A evidence). Pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine have been established as effective for up to 6 months in treating RLS/WED (Level A). The following drugs have been established as probably effective (Level B) in treating RLS/WED for durations ranging from 1 to 5 years: <b>gabapentin</b> <b>enacarbil,</b> pramipexole, and ropinirole (1 year); levodopa (2 years); and rotigotine (5 years). Because of associated safety concerns, pergolide and cabergoline {{should not be used}} in the treatment of RLS/WED unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Other pharmacologic therapies have insufficient evidence to support their long-term use in treating RLS/WED. The IRLSSG Task Force also developed consensus-based strategies for the prevention and treatment of complications (such as augmentation, loss of efficacy, excessive daytime sleepiness, and impulse control disorders) that may develop with the long-term pharmacologic treatment of RLS/WED. The use of either a dopamine-receptor agonist or α 2 δ calcium-channel ligand is recommended as the first-line treatment of RLS/WED for most patients, with the choice of agent dependent on the patient’s severity of RLS/WED symptoms, cognitive status, history, and comorbid conditions...|$|E

GEn significantly improved all MOS Sleep Scale domain scores from baseline compared with placebo (P < 0. 05) in both subgroups. Compared with placebo, GEn-treated subjects with very severe to severe sleep disturbance reported higher overall sleep quality, fewer nighttime awakenings, and fewer hours awake per night due to RLS symptoms at Week 12 on the Post Sleep Questionnaire (all P < 0. 001, distribution of responses); sleep quality was the only significant item in those with moderate to no sleep disturbance (P < 0. 0001). Evaluation of sleep endpoints derived from the 24 -Hour RLS Symptom Diary and PghSD yielded similar results. Conclusion: Once-daily GEn 1200 mg significantly improves subjective sleep outcomes compared with placebo in subjects with RLS, regardless of the severity of sleep disturbance at baseline, although a greater improvement in sleep assessments may be observed in subjects with very severe to severe sleep disturbance than in those with moderate to no disturbance. Similar patterns were observed between treatment groups when comparing sleep endpoints derived from the PghSD and the novel sleep endpoints derived from the 24 -Hour RLS Symptom Diary.
