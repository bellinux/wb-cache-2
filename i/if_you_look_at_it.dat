It was a thought experiment that took {{on a life of}} its own." [...] Miller continued that at the time, he and Stentz thought they were writing Olivia-focused episodes, but [...] "In retrospect, we really wrote a four-part story about Walter, his relationship to children, and the struggle between Walter-who-was and Walter-who-is. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> that way, his decision at the end of 'Northwest Passage' becomes the moment where he reconciles those things. He doesn't resolve them, but he comes to grips with them. Once again in retrospect, I think that's what the supermarket breakdown was really about. This happens — you think a scene is about one thing when you're in the middle of it, and realize it's something else entirely when you look back. Characters can be sneaky motherfuckers that way." ...|$|E

McCartney explained: [...] "One {{of the things we}} were very much into in those days was eye messages... So with Michael Cooper's inside photo, we all said, 'Now look into this camera and really say I love you! Really try and feel love; really give love through this! It'll come out; it'll show; it's an attitude.' And that's what that is, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> you'll see the big effort from the eyes." [...] The album's inner sleeve featured artwork by the Dutch design team the Fool that eschewed {{for the first time the}} standard white paper in favour of an abstract pattern of waves of maroon, red, pink and white. Included with the album as a bonus gift was a sheet of cardboard cut-outs designed by Blake and Haworth, a postcard-sized portrait of Sgt. Pepper based on a statue from Lennon's house that was used on the front cover, a fake moustache, two sets of sergeant stripes, two lapel badges and a stand-up cut-out of the Beatles in their satin uniforms. Moore believes that the inclusion of these items helped fans [...] "pretend to be in the band". However, many others have speculated that there may be a deeper meaning.|$|E

Construction on the Koubek-designed , $23 million L'Enfant Plaza Hotel and office building began until June 1971. In July 1970, construction began on his 37-story, pink granite United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company Building in Baltimore. It was the largest building yet constructed in the United States to employ the slipform method of continuously poured concrete. The USF Building successfully sparked the economic revival of the Inner Harbor. Opened in 1974, as of 2010 it remained the tallest building in Baltimore. Forty years later, it is considered a Baltimore landmark. Richard Burns of Design Collective Inc. has said, [...] "In my opinion, his USF tower, now Legg Mason, {{is one of the}} best if not the best office buildings in downtown Baltimore. It is simple, direct and honest..." [...] David Wallace, whose Wallace Roberts and Todd designed the master site plan for the Inner Harbor, declared it the [...] "linchpin for the Inner Harbor. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> from a boat, it's a punctuation point at one corner of the Inner Harbor, signifying where the central business district meets the waterfront." [...] Construction started on his eight-story 2021 K Street NW office building in November 1970. In the summer of 1971, he completed his site plan for Friendship Heights, a [...] site straddling the boundary between the District of Columbia and Maryland border at Friendship Heights/Friendship Village. The plan contemplated several high-rise office buildings, a loop roadway around the site, pedestrian concourses, and several multi-story shopping malls clustered around the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and Western Avenue. (The project was built throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s.) In March 1971, the American Automobile Association commissioned him to design a six-story, $10-million headquarters for the group at 8111 Gatehouse Road in Fairfax, Virginia. Eight months later, the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) began construction on a Koubek-designed headquarters at 1625 Massachusetts Avenue NW, three blocks northwest from his 1965 office building and across the street from the Philippine Embassy. In March 1974, developer Melvin Lenkin commissioned Koubek to design an all-glass Modernist building for 1900 M Street NW. [...] Koubek designed an eight-story cubist building with an all-glass facade; cutaway, cantilevered front corner; and ground floor arcade. In March 1975, the National Bank of Washington, one of the city's oldest and most storied banks, commissioned a new operations center (4340 Connecticut Avenue NW) from Koubek. In May 1975, Koubek joined a consortium of prominent local architects to design the Washington Harbor complex of buildings on the Georgetown waterfront. The three-block-long, eight-building complex, which contained luxury condominiums, office space, restaurants, luxury retail space, a boardwalk, and plaza, was the first large-scale redevelopment of Georgetown's waterfront in the city's history. By the end of 1975, The New York Times was reporting that Koubek's firm had designed roughly half the office buildings built in the District of Columbia since the 1950s.|$|E

2500|$|Francis fears some clerics [...] "become {{wolves and}} not shepherds; ... careerism {{and the search}} for a {{promotion}} [...] come under the category of spiritual worldliness", deceitfully trying to appear holy. Francis became known for his snarky remarks. He said of clerical vanity: [...] "Look at the peacock; it's beautiful <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> from the front. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> from behind, you discover the truth. ...Whoever gives in to such self-absorbed vanity has huge misery hiding inside them".

She was written as a sympathetic character; with Doug Petrie claiming [...] "I connected with Faith early on. I love that character. She's totally tragic." [...] According to Petrie, [...] "The whole key to Faith is that she's in pain. If you took that away, {{she would be a}} monster. But she's so lonely and so desperate, and all of her toughness comes out of trying to cover that. That's what real monsters are made of. No one thinks they're really a monster." [...] Petrie claims Faith's main motivation is to find a family and friends; she sees treacherous Watcher Gwendolyn Post as the mother she never had, the Scooby Gang as the friends she never had, and the Mayor as the father she never had. [...] "So she's always looking for a family and always coming up short and making these horrible choices, and it drove her insane" [...] says Petrie. [...] "Plus I think she was missing a couple of screws to begin with. 'If you don't love me, you will fear me,' is kind of her m.o. She's not a stable girl, but a fun one." [...] Petrie describes the character's name as [...] "wildly ironic", due to her cynical nature. According to Petrie, [...] "She's the most faithless character we've got. She doesn't trust herself or anyone around her. We try to do that a lot with our monsters. It's much more fun <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> from their point of view." ...|$|E
