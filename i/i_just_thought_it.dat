500|$|Every {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} an ornamental hare somewhere on-screen. According to Pemberton, [...] "Because each episode is so wildly different {{there was nothing}} really linking them {{other than the fact}} they were all inside a Number Nine, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{would be nice to have}} an object that you could hide and just have there on every set." [...] There is, however, no particular significance to the hare itself. The hare is visible in [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] on a table in Squires's fireplace. However, there is also a [...] "second" [...] hare. While it is not visible in the partially completed crossword shown at the end of the episode, the crossword published in The Guardian contains a nina spelling ONELEPUS, Lepus being the generic name for hares.|$|E
500|$|The dark, ironic {{lyrics of}} [...] "Today", {{describing}} {{a day when}} Corgan was feeling depressed and suicidal, contrast with the instrumentation. Michael Snyder of the San Francisco Chronicle said that the song is [...] "downright pretty as rock ballads go" [...] but that [...] "Corgan manages to convey the exhilaration and tragic release he seeks." [...] Corgan told Rolling Stone that [...] "I was really suicidal... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was funny to write a song that said today is the greatest day of your life because it can't get any worse." [...] Corgan later compared writing the lyrics of [...] "Today" [...] and [...] "Disarm" [...] to [...] "ripping [...] guts out."

5000|$|While {{being asked}} why she chose to be nude in the video, Morissette said, [...] "Actually, the idea for that video hit me in my shower - I was {{thinking}} about the song and its simplicity and its baring itself, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> ‘Wouldn’t <b>it</b> be great if <b>I</b> could <b>just</b> walk around New York City or grocery stores in just a symbolism of being naked everywhere I went?’. Less about overt sexuality and more about the symbolism of being really raw and naked and intimate in all these environments where you’d seemingly need protection, like in a subway and those kinds of places. So that hit me in the shower and then we executed it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Her debut album, For Lovers, Dreamers & Me, was a {{collection}} of songs spanning genres from country to rock to funk. The title was borrowed from the Muppets. [...] "We {{were just trying to}} think of a title because I haven’t thought of a name after it was all done," [...] {{she said in an interview}} with Hiphoprnbsoul.com. [...] "We were thinking about the music and we were throwing ideas around. We were thinking about The Beatles and The Wizard of Oz and whatever else made us think of. Then something made me think of The Muppets. I don’t even know. It wasn't something in the forefront of my mind. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>it</b> and it came to me like that." ...|$|R
500|$|Morrison {{recalled}} his {{first encounter with}} Dylan's music {{in an interview in}} 2000: [...] "I think I heard [...] in a record shop in Smith Street.

The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens the whole thing up." [...] Morrison's record producer at the time, Bert Berns, encouraged him to find models for his songs, so he bought Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home album in March 1965. One of the songs on the album held a unique fascination for Morrison and he soon started performing [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] in small clubs and pubs as a solo artist (without Them).|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Daniel Chun, his fourth writing credit of the series. It was directed by then-showrunner Paul Lieberstein, his sixth directing credit of the series. The episode marked the first appearance of Will Ferrell's four-episode arc on the series and {{is also one of}} series star, Carell's last episodes as a regular on the series. Ferrell signed on to appear in Steve Carell's final three episodes, and the first episode without Carell, [...] "The Inner Circle", to make Carell's transition easier. Carell had decided to leave the series, because [...] "I just think it's time... I want to fulfill my contract. When I first signed on I had a contract for seven seasons, and this coming year is my seventh. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was time for my character to go".

And I remember thinking, 'Damn, these girls are fly.' <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was the ultimate sexy show I've ever seen.

[...] Talking about the video, Nava noted that for the shooting Beyoncé {{was trying to be}} [...] "even more risque than she's been in the past". While filming, he further tried to [...] "create and capture a bit of genuine intimacy" [...] between the singer and her husband. During a commentary about the video for the song, Beyoncé revealed her motivation to film it by saying, ...|$|E
5000|$|Curtis {{developed}} {{the idea in}} 1999 as an art oriented recording project. It was conceptually stimulated by biospheres, the idiosyncratic way Regurgitator recorded albums, and {{by the idea of}} the insular artistic recording process, juxtaposed against the extroverted performer and how that might impact on the creative mindset. Curtis initially failed to convince Regurgitator of the merits of his idea, and it was set aside for a number of years. Quan Yeomans, the bands guitarist, noted that he became more open to the idea of being in a bubble after seeing David Blaines magic stunt. Yeomans told The Age, [...] "I happened to be there when David Blaine did his stunt over the Thames, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> wouldnt <b>it</b> be interesting if he was doing something creative, as opposed to just sitting around doing nothing?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Rogers {{released}} his first solo album What Rhymes With Cars And Girls in 1999 after his relocation to Melbourne. Rogers later provided a brief background for an album that was recorded over a three-week period on an eight-track digital recorder: [...] "I had some time alone and I found myself writing some songs and then <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> well <b>it</b> looks like You Am I's {{not going to}} be recording for a while, while we're waiting for albums to come out overseas, so I wanna make a record…" [...] Recorded at the home studio of Weddings Parties Anything band member Jen Anderson, the album mostly consists of country/folk-style songs, even though Rogers hesitated at the idea of a country sound. Rogers used the name The Twin Set for his backing band, {{as well as for the}} corresponding tour. He later won an ARIA award for Best Male Artist for the album.|$|R
5000|$|After {{taking time}} off from the music business, Blake Sennett {{returned}} with a third Elected album entitled Bury Me In My Rings, which was released on 17 May 2011 via Vagrant Records. Described as [...] "complete with twelve shimmering pop songs reminiscent of mid-century West Coast rock", Sennett played most instruments and produced the album himself: “I played most of the instruments myself, so {{it was easier to}} erase stuff without hurting anyone’s feelings. This time <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> better take <b>it</b> as far as I can alone… then bring in my friends to fill in the blanks.” ...|$|R
500|$|... "Goodbye, Michael" [...] {{was written}} by series {{developer}} and executive producer Greg Daniels, his 10th writing credit of the series. The episode was directed by Paul Feig, marking his 14th credit for the series. On June 28, 2010, {{it was confirmed that}} the seventh season of The Office would be Steve Carell's last. He had previously announced this while being interviewed on BBC Radio. [...] "I just think it's time... I want to fulfill my contract. When I first signed on I had a contract for seven seasons, and this coming year is my seventh. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was time for my character to go," [...] Carell was quoted as saying. In January 2011, it was announced that Carell would exit the show early, four episodes {{before the end of the}} season. A few weeks after this announcement came the news that Will Ferrell, who previously starred alongside Carell in , had signed on to appear in a four-episode arc as a Dunder Mifflin branch manager who temporarily takes Michael Scott's position in Scranton. To help ease the transition, Ferrell appeared in Carell's final episodes as well as one additional episode after he departs.|$|E
500|$|The Prince-inspired [...] "Cross Dresser" [...] has a {{new wave}} style and {{whimsical}} lyrics in which the narrator holds on {{to the memory of}} his lost love by wearing her clothes. Hunt said that he did not intend for the song to have a meaning other than the explicit: [...] "I just thought it was funny. It's {{one of those things that}} people talk about, but that's never really happened to me. But I literally wrote it in 20 minutes. It felt good ... It was really quick and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was something silly and funny." [...] "It's a Mysterious Hustle" [...] features somber strings, a languid rhythm, an eerie piano vamp, and bitter singing by Hunt. It was recorded solely by Hunt, who played guitar, keyboards, and electronic drums. Its lyrics are about having to [...] "work your way through the crowd" [...] and [...] "overcome the place you come from", and view the world as [...] "no place to raise a child". Its spoken word conclusion preaches, [...] "If you follow the beaten path, it will keep you tied to the past." ...|$|E
500|$|The maniacal {{schoolmaster}} was {{voiced by}} Waters, and actress Trudy Young supplied the groupie's voice. Backing vocals were {{performed by a}} range of artists, although a planned appearance by the Beach Boys on [...] "The Show Must Go On" [...] and [...] "Waiting for the Worms" [...] was cancelled by Waters, who instead settled for Beach Boy Bruce Johnston and Toni Tennille. [...] Ezrin's suggestion to release [...] "Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2" [...] as a single with a disco-style beat did not initially find favour with Gilmour, although Mason and Waters were more enthusiastic. Waters was opposed {{to the idea of}} releasing a single at all, but became more receptive once he listened to Ezrin and Guthrie's mix of the song. With two identical verses the song was felt to be lacking, and so a copy was sent to Griffiths in London with a request to find children to perform several versions of the lyrics. Griffiths contacted Alun Renshaw, head of music at the nearby Islington Green school, who was enthusiastic about the idea, saying: [...] "I wanted to make music relevant to the kids – not just sitting around listening to Tchaikovsky. I thought the lyrics were great – [...] "We don't need no education, we don't need no thought control..." [...] <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be a wonderful experience for the kids." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rivers Cuomo's {{story behind}} [...] "Beverly Hills": [...] "I {{was at the}} opening of the new Hollywood Bowl and I flipped through the program and I saw a picture of Wilson Phillips. And for some reason <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> how nice <b>it</b> would be to marry, like, an “established” celebrity and live in Beverly Hills and be part of that world. And it was a totally sincere desire. And then I wrote that song, Beverly Hills. For some reason, by the time it came out—and the video came out—it got twisted around into {{something}} that seemed sarcastic. But originally it wasn’t meant to be sarcastic at all." ...|$|R

5000|$|The season {{did not end}} on such a {{high note}} though. After {{receiving}} a bye to {{the quarterfinals of the}} SEC Tournament, Kentucky lost that game to Vanderbilt. Showing a great deal of emotion, Harrow blamed himself while fighting tears in post game interviews. Kentucky was later eliminated by Robert Morris in the NIT’s opening round. Two weeks later, Harrow announced that he would be transferring universities to be with his father. “I really {{tried not to think about}} it until the season was all the way over,” Harrow said. “It was a hard decision because I knew how good Kentucky was going to be this season.” Ryan's father was his only family member still living in Atlanta, and he felt like he needed to be there with him. “We have a saying in my family, ‘Family First’,” Harrow said. “We’ve all got that tattooed on us. My dad is the only one in Atlanta, and with the struggles that he's going through, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> would be best for me to come back and help him with whatever he needed.” ...|$|R
500|$|When an {{interviewer}} {{asked him to}} describe himself as a child, he replied that he was [...] "probably well-meaning and naive like all kids." [...] His passion for sea life {{can be traced to}} his childhood, when several films by French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau made a strong impression on him. He has said that Cousteau [...] "provided a view into that world", which he did not know existed. He liked to explore tide pools as a child, bringing home objects that [...] "should have been left there and that ended up dying and smelling really bad." [...] Also at a young age, Hillenburg developed his interest in art. His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration that he drew in third grade depicting [...] "a bunch of army men... kissing and hugging instead of fighting" [...] marked the first praise that he received for his work after his teacher commended it. [...] "Of course, this is 1970... She liked it because, I mean, obviously that {{was in the middle of}} [...] She was, I would imagine, not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. ...I had no idea about the implications, really, because <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a funny idea. I remember that still, that moment when she said, 'oh my gosh, look at that,'" [...] Hillenburg elaborated. It was then when he knew that he [...] "had some [...] skill". Hillenburg asserted that his artistry comes from his mother's side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was [...] "really, really gifted" [...] and a [...] "great painter". In the 1970s, someone took him to the International Tournée of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Hillenburg was [...] "knocked out" [...] by the foreign animated films that were screened at the festival, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen's The Killing of an Egg (1977). [...] "That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on," [...] he recounted.|$|E

Defending her actions, Thorning-Schmidt said, [...] "There were lots of pictures taken that day, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a bit fun.

"When I ran the race," [...] Stallard said in Winning, [...] "I didn't think {{anything}} of it. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{was something that}} would be taken up by others. I thought that, when the point had been proved, the NCU would be only too pleased to find that they'd got a bit of activity. It had all been above board. The police had never seen one, of course, but I just told them it was in conformity with international practice and races of this type were organised in all different countries and they had no queries at all." ...|$|E
5000|$|Powers {{claimed that}} [...] "the best moments of this album are those when vintage Blur styles are evoked with new expertise. The {{meandering}} [...] "Good Song" [...] {{is a beautiful}} case in point. Acoustic guitar picking is matched with temperate drums and a sweet, steady bass countermelody. Albarn's singing is mostly in his mid-range, falling out as easily as breath. Signature background vocal harmonies are there to brighten up the track, but their muted nature doesn't descend into campiness. What's also new is the expert use of electronic noises and drumbeats to fatten the sound." [...] Albarn said [...] "well, that was originally called 'De La Soul' on our huge list of songs, half finished ideas. It was called 'De La Soul you know, right until the end. And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> always <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a good song and just called it 'Good Song'.

5000|$|In 2006 Morrison {{was voted}} as the No. 2 {{favourite}} comic book writer {{of all time}} by Comic Book Resources. That same year, Morrison began writing Batman for DC with issue No. 655, reintroducing the character of Damian Wayne and signalling {{the beginning of a}} seven-year-long run on the character across multiple titles. He wrote the relaunch of The Authority and Wildcats, with the art of Gene Ha and Jim Lee respectively, for DC's Wildstorm imprint. WildC.A.T.S. went on hiatus after one issue, The Authority was discontinued after two. The scheduling of The Authority conflicted with 52 and Morrison was unhappy with the reviews: [...] "And then I saw the reviews on issue one and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> 'fuck this'.". <b>It</b> eventually concluded without Morrison's involvement in Keith Giffen's The Authority: The Lost Year.|$|R

With the visa denial, she ended up couch-surfing, sleeping at other people's houses in London, as her constant touring on dates in Canada, Argentina and Brazil meant that she {{no longer had a}} home in England. She said in an interview [...] "I had to start from scratch with what was around me. The thing is, I get bored easily, and I don't see the point of doing something twice. I made Arular in London; I'd already made a real London album. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> fuck <b>it.</b> If I'm gonna couch-surf in London, I might as well go and couch surf in India or Liberia." [...] M.I.A. opted to record the album at a variety of locations around the world, beginning by travelling to India following the release of [...] "Bucky Done Gun" [...] and the last date of her Arular Tour in Japan in February 2006. She said of her decision [...] "I {{wanted to get out of}} people's view: to go and spend time learning about myself and trying to be better.

His final game was a one day match against Victoria where Malone took 3-19 off seven overs. Malone said [...] "I felt I was struggling {{to get into the}} Shield team and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was time to retire.

Paltrow and Martin have two children together: daughter Apple Blythe Alison Martin (b. 2004) and son Moses Bruce Anthony Martin (b. 2006).

I wrote {{the whole thing and}} honestly I wrote it about this whole experience, this breakup and the two years I was in a mess. Just being able to write was amazing. My label sent me away to Los Angeles and said, ‘Don’t come back until you’re done writing a whole album.’ So it was great just to get away. And there wasn’t much collaboration; most of the producers were friends of mine in Los Angeles." [...] Fernandes co-wrote and wrote all of the songs on the album.

My first day on set was <b>just</b> crazy. <b>I</b> was on Albert Square—a dream come true—I'm enjoying every second." [...] When Mojekwu was asked in an interview with media website Digital Spy how she felt about being the only main cast member from EastEnders: E20 not appearing in EastEnders, she said: [...] "If I was meant to go into the main show, then I would have done. Obviously I'd have loved to but for someone like my character, it'll be the support of the viewers that decide her fate. I don't feel upset or anything, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it's</b> the way these things go." [...] It was announced on 24 January 2010 that Mercy would appear in EastEnders later in 2010. Executive producer Diederick Santer said that once he had seen the completed episodes of EastEnders: E20, he wanted Mercy in the main show as well, and stated: [...] "Mercy's also been a huge hit with E20 viewers—she's funny, warm, sensitive and rather mysterious. [...] I'm delighted Bunmi will be bringing those qualities to the wider EastEnders audience." [...] Mercy and her grandmother Grace's introduction to EastEnders made them the first Nigerian family to appear in the series. Mojekwu was surprised at how long it took the programme to represent her community in the series, but congratulated them for doing so, saying [...] "they {{have a long way to}} go in representing us." [...] Mercy's younger sister Faith Olubunmi was introduced in series 3 of E20.|$|R

Don't Look Now has been much admired by and an influence on subsequent filmmakers. Danny Boyle cites Nicolas Roeg as a key influence on his work and counts it amongst his favourite films. Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, and Jeremy Dyson drew upon Don't Look Now considerably for their television series The League of Gentlemen; Pemberton ranks it among the top three British horror films of the 1960s and 1970s, and says that he wants things he has written to make audiences feel the way he felt when he watched The Wicker Man and Don't Look Now. Similarly, Ryan Murphy considers his TV series American Horror Story to be a throwback to '60s and '70s psychological horror, citing Don't Look Now, Rosemary's Baby and The Shining as particular examples. Thematic and narrative similarities with Lars von Trier's Antichrist have also been observed, with Antichrist's cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, commenting that he has watched Don't Look Now more times than any other film. Fabrice Du Welz, whose film Vinyan has often been compared to Don't Look Now, has stated that it is a film he is [...] "obsessed with", and one of his favourites, while Lynne Ramsay cited it as an influence on We Need to Talk about Kevin, which incidentally is also produced by Roeg's son, Luc. Ami Canaan Mann has also acknowledged she was influenced by atmospheric thrillers such as Picnic at Hanging Rock and Don't Look Now while directing her debut feature, Texas Killing Fields.|$|R
