5|$|At {{the time}} of his National Letter of Intent signing with Michigan Wolverines basketball, ESPN.com and Scout.com ranked McGary as the number two player in the United States high school class of 2012, while Rivals.com ranked him as the number three prospect. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the {{consensus}} top power forward recruit in the nation, but also the top big man according to most sources at the time. After his signing, however, McGary fell down in the rankings as his underdeveloped offensive skills became apparent.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> {{concerned}} with higher education, {{but also with}} primary education, and promoted the creation of free schools for poor children. In those schools, students would learn to read and learn basic maths and the catechism. He thought that this would help to raise people willing to work, and reduce laziness.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{also found}} {{evidence}} that Mandela had been {{an active member of}} the South African Communist Party during the late 1950s and early 1960s, something that was confirmed after his death by both the ANC and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee. His membership had been hidden by the ANC, aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from Western countries. Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist-Leninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.|$|E

5|$|Warhol {{subsequently}} {{produced a}} wide variety of art works depicting Campbell's Soup cans during three distinct phases of his career, and he produced other works using a variety of images from the world of commerce and mass media. Today, the Campbell's Soup cans theme is generally used in reference to the original set of paintings as well as the later Warhol drawings and paintings depicting Campbell's Soup cans. Because of the eventual popularity of the entire series of similarly themed works, Warhol's reputation grew to the point where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the most-renowned American pop art artist, but also the highest-priced living American artist.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by {{the actions}} of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement in the Cuban Revolution, in 1961 Mandela, Sisulu, and Slovo co-founded Umkhonto we Sizwe ("Spear of the Nation", {{abbreviated}} MK). Becoming chairman of the militant group, Mandela gained ideas from literature on guerilla warfare by Marxist militants Mao and Che Guevara {{as well as from the}} military theorist Carl von Clausewitz. Although initially declared officially separate from the ANC so as not to taint the latter's reputation, MK was later widely recognised as the party's armed wing. Most early MK members were white communists who were able to conceal Mandela in their homes; after hiding in communist Wolfie Kodesh's flat in Berea, Mandela moved to the communist-owned Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia, there joined by Raymond Mhlaba, Slovo, and Bernstein, who put together the MK constitution. Although in later life Mandela denied, for political reasons, ever being a member of the Communist Party, historical research published in 2011 strongly suggested that he had joined in the late 1950s or early 1960s. This was confirmed by both the SACP and the ANC after Mandela's death. According to the SACP, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee.|$|E

25|$|It {{was natural}} for Symmachus to sympathise with Magnus Maximus who had {{defeated}} Gratian.

Having been pardoned through the intervention of numerous and powerful friends he expressed his contrition and gratitude in an apologetic address to Theodosius, by whom <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> forgiven, but was received into favour and elevated to the consulship in 391, and during {{the remainder of his}} life he appears to have taken an active part in public affairs.

25|$|Although Hayashi was {{the head}} of JSDF in the {{capacity}} of Chairman of JSC, he had limited powers to assume command in joint operations as the JSC itself {{was no more than a}} consultative body. It was not changed until 1961, when the functions of the JSC were modified and the Chairman was empowered to give orders to the JSDF when there was an operation. The Chairman was also given greater command authority in joint operations with greater powers to execute orders from the Director-General of JDA. Hayashi retired from the JSC in August 1964 after ten years of service. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the longest-serving Chairman, but was also the only Chairman with civilian civil service background. All of his successors were career military officers and their tenure was confined to around one to three years only.|$|E

25|$|Hayashi {{helped found}} the JSC and the JSDF after Japan regained {{its status as a}} {{sovereign}} state under the Treaty of San Francisco in 1954.

Having served in the JSC for ten years, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the longest-serving Chairman, but was also the only Chairman with civilian civil service background.

25|$|The {{historian}} Ngô Sĩ Liên praised Trần Thánh Tông {{as one of}} {{the finest}} emperors of the Trần dynasty. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> a righteous ruler but also a dutiful son, kind-hearted brother and father with sense of responsibility who was credited for the stability of both the royal family and the whole country.

Moreover, like his brother Trần Quang Khải, Trần Ích Tắc and Trần Nhật Duật, Trần Thánh Tông was a renowned scholar, Thánh Tông taught his princes by his own poems, and he also had a literary work named Di hậu lục. The Emperor was only criticized sometimes by Ngô Sĩ Liên, a Confucian historian, for his devotion for Buddhism, which was not suitable for a person in such a high position like him.|$|E

When Sun Quan personally led the Wu forces to attack Zhuge Dan, Sun He showed grave concern about his father: he could not rest and have his meals in peace, repeatedly reminded his father to be careful, and hoped that his father would win the battle. He only put aside his worries upon seeing his father return safely to Wu.|$|E
