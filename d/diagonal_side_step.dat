40|$|A {{variety of}} {{experimental}} data on synthetase-tRNA interactions are examined. Although these data previously had no direct explanation when viewed {{only in terms}} of the tRNA cloverleaf diagram, they can be rationalized according to a simple proposal that takes account of the three dimensional structure of tRNA. It is proposed that {{a major part of the}} binding site for most or all synthetases is along and around the <b>diagonal</b> <b>side</b> of the tRNA structure, which contains the acceptor stem, dihydrouridine stem, and anticodon. This side of the tRNA molecule contains structural features likely to be common for all tRNAs. Depending on the system, an enzyme may span a small part or all of the region of this side of the molecule. Interactions with other parts of the structure may also occur in a manner that varies from complex to complex. These interactions may be determined, in part, by the angle at which the <b>diagonal</b> <b>side</b> of the flat tRNA molecule is inserted onto the surface of the synthetase...|$|R

40|$|Reduced {{ability to}} {{circumvent}} an obstacle, which is noticed only shortly before collision, {{could be a}} cause of falls and injury, especially in older adults. In this study, we investigated differences in strategies and their characteristics between young and older adults when circumventing a suddenly appearing obstacle. We measured young and older adults while walking over a platform, while in some trials an obstacle suddenly appeared halfway, blocking their passage. Obstacle appearance was timed to provide available response times (ART) of 850, 1000 or 1150 ms. Circumvention strategies {{could be classified as}} either <b>side</b> <b>stepping</b> or cross-over stepping, which were observed in both age groups. Strategy choice was affected by ART and age; older adults preferred the <b>side</b> <b>step</b> strategy, especially when ART was shorter. Peak ground reaction forces were higher for the <b>side</b> <b>step</b> strategy. Older adults performed similar circumvention strategies as young adults, with a stronger preference for <b>side</b> <b>stepping.</b> This strategy appears to be more stable, although it is more demanding in terms of force generation...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{characteristics}} of the foot pressure distribution for primary movements in football (soccer) using an insole pressure distribution measurement system (F-scan system; Nitta Inc). For this study, six male university football players were instructed to carry out typical movements such as sprinting, running backwards, <b>side</b> <b>stepping,</b> diving, turning and jumping. The pressure distribution was analyzed with the foot divided into 12 areas. In the case of sprinting movement, the maximum vertical peak pressure was observed on the area of the first metatarsal head or the hallux. In the case of running backwards, there was little pressure on the area of heel. On both the fore foot and the rear foot in the case of <b>side</b> <b>stepping</b> movement, the maximum vertical peak pressure was observed on the area of first metatarsal head. The path trajectory of the centre of pressure was through the longitudinal section of the sole of the foot without the case of running backwards and <b>side</b> <b>stepping...</b>|$|R
