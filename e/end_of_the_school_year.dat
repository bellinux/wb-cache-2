5|$|In 2016 {{there were}} 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were {{operated}} {{by the government and}} 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>year,</b> and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy.
