5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, projection was split into two classes: [...] "If the light traverses the object, the projection is said to be <b>diascopic,</b> if by reflected light, episcopic." ...|$|E
50|$|Granulosis rubra nasi {{is a rare}} {{familial}} disease of children, occurring on the nose, cheeks, and chin, characterized by diffuse redness, persistent hyperhidrosis, and small dark red papules that disappear on <b>diascopic</b> pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike a {{compound}} light microscope, illumination in a stereo microscope most often uses reflected illumination rather than transmitted (<b>diascopic)</b> illumination, that is, light reflected {{from the surface}} of an object rather than light transmitted through an object. Use of reflected light from the object allows examination of specimens that would be too thick or otherwise opaque for compound microscopy. Some stereo microscopes are also capable of transmitted light illumination as well, typically by having a bulb or mirror beneath a transparent stage underneath the object, though unlike {{a compound}} microscope, transmitted illumination is not focused through a condenser in most systems. Stereoscopes with specially-equipped illuminators can be used for dark field microscopy, using either reflected or transmitted light.|$|E
50|$|The {{projector}} magnifies {{the profile}} of the specimen, and displays this on the built-in projection screen. On this screen there is typically a grid that can be rotated 360 degrees so the X-Y axis of the screen can be aligned with a straight edge of the machined part to examine or measure. This projection screen displays {{the profile of}} the specimen and is magnified for better ease of calculating linear measurements.An edge of the specimen to examine may be lined up with the grid on the screen. From there, simple measurements may be taken for distances to other points. This is being done on a magnified profile of the specimen. It can be simpler as well as reduce errors by measuring on the magnified projection screen of a profile projector. The typical method for lighting is by <b>diascopic</b> illumination, which is lighting from behind. This type of lighting is also called transmitted illumination when the specimen is translucent and light can pass through it. If the specimen is opaque, then the light will not go through it, but will form a profile of the specimen. Measuring of the sample can be done on the projection screen. A profile projector may also have episcopic illumination (which is light shining from above). This useful in displaying bores or internal areas that may need to be measured.|$|E
40|$|Granuloma faciale (GF) is a benign, chronic {{inflammatory}} disorder, {{characterized by}} reddish brown plaques with prominent follicular orifices and telangeictasia, usually occurring over the face. The condition often presents {{a problem in}} differential diagnosis. Herein we describe a case of GF with an unusual <b>diascopic</b> finding of an apple jelly appearance on diascopy...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of a computer-assisted, three-dimensional reconstruction procedure for serial sections to embryonic rat hearts {{during the period of}} cardiac looping and compartmentalization is described. The procedure relies on immunohistochemical staining for the introduction of selective contrast and on episcopic and <b>diascopic</b> images of each of the sections for alignment and correction of compression due to sectioning. Episcopic (reference) images are taken from the embedding block just before the cutting of a slice and are still aligned and undeformed. <b>Diascopic</b> images are taken from the sections after immunohistochemical processing and, hence, contain selective contrast but are deformed and no longer aligned. The three-dimensional images are visualized as shaded voxel models. This approach allowed the unequivocal delineation of the developing myocardium and the inspection of its changing architecture both from the outside and from within. Furthermore, it allowed a quantification of myocardial volume. Because standardized and hence comparable views of three different stages were generated, changes {{in the shape of the}} cardiac loop, the atria, and the ventricles as well as changes in the position of the atrioventricular canal and interventricular foramen could be accurately described. Characteristic changes in the position of both the right ventricle and the atrioventricular canal that are essential for the formation of a correctly functioning four-chambered heart could be observed. These changes in shape occur while the myocardial size increases dramaticall...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWaveguiding by dielectric-loaded surface plasmon-polaritons (DLSPP) {{structures}} are numerically and experimentally investigated. We used the effective index model {{to understand the}} influence of basic waveguide parameters such as width and thickness on {{the properties of the}} surface plasmon guided modes. A waveguide was fabricated and experimentally studied. The effective indices of the modes supported by the waveguide and their propagation length are evaluated by leakage radiation microscopy in both the Fourier and imaging planes. Several excitation schemes were tested including surface plasmon coupling by <b>diascopic</b> or episcopic illumination as well as defect-mediated excitation of guided modes. We found good agreement between theoretical values predicted by the effective index model and experimental values deduced from leakage radiation images...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we propose {{and build a}} {{multimodal}} optical workstation that extends a commercially available confocal microscope (Nikon Confocal C 1 -Si) to include nonlinear∕multiphoton microscopy and optical manipulation∕stimulation tools such as nanosurgery. The setup allows both subsystems (confocal and nonlinear) to work independently and simultaneously. The workstation enables, for instance, nanosurgery along with simultaneous confocal and brightfield imaging. The nonlinear microscopy capabilities are added around the commercial confocal microscope by exploiting all the flexibility offered by this microscope and without need for any mechanical or electronic modification of the confocal microscope systems. As an example, the standard differential interference contrast condenser and <b>diascopic</b> detector in the confocal microscope are readily used as a forward detection mount for second harmonic generation imaging. The various capabilities of this workstation, as applied directly to biology, are demonstrated using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans...|$|E
40|$|High-throughput {{detection}} {{is always}} attractive for researchers in developing sensing techniques. Recently, MEMS techniques have become well-established to produce miniaturized microfluidic devices with low-cost and small size. However, large-scale conventional off-chip detection approaches may limit the throughput of the detection systems {{such that the}} benefits come with the miniaturization are hindered. This review gives a brief overview {{for the development of}} high-throughput detection techniques in microfluidic systems, especially for the major optically fluorescence detections. Fundamental fluorescence techniques and two microfluidic systems including the micro capillary electrophoresis and the micro flow cytometer are introduced in this review. Various approaches for developing high-throughput and parallel fluorescence detection in microfluidic system are reviewed. A state-of-the-art <b>diascopic</b> illumination system for multispectral analysis in microfluidic systems is also included. Even though great progress for high-throughput bio-analysis has been made during the past decades, there is plenty of room for further improving the performance of existing detection techniques...|$|E
40|$|A high {{performance}} <b>diascopic</b> illumination configuration is presented for the simultaneous detection of cells and particles with different sizes and different fluorescence labels in a microchannel. In the proposed approach, the cells/particles are illuminated by an objective-type dark-field condenser {{equipped with a}} low-cost tungsten light source and are then characterized by extracting the side-scatter, absorbance, and fluorescence signals from the spectra obtained by a ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) spectrometer. A modified computation model is adopted to improve the capability for discriminating more fluorescence dyes simultaneously. The feasibility of the proposed detection configuration is demonstrated by counting and classifying a mixed sample of green, red, and crimson fluorescent-labeled particles and non-labeled particles with various dimensions. The suitability of the proposed system for real-world cytometry applications is then evaluated by classifying a mixed bio-sample comprising of gastric epithelial (AGS) cells stained with Trypan-blue and Erythrosin-bluish dye, respectively. The {{results show that the}} cytometer enables the efficient detection, identification, and classification of mixed bio-samples without the need for spatial filters or delicate optical components. Consequently, the proposed system has significant potential for high-performance micro-flow cytometry applications...|$|E
