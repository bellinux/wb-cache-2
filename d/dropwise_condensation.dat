Previous research has shown nanoengineered superhydrophobic surfaces are promising to enable sustained <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> over long duration because these surfaces are usually designed to be Cassie stable and favor the condensate drop departure.

Experimental and theoretical studies of <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> were conducted on both nanostructured superhydrophobic and flat hydrophobic copper surfaces. Superhydrophobic copper surfaces with nanoribbon structures using wet chemical oxidation followed by fluorization treatment, which yield a water contact angle of 160 ° and contact angle hysteresis less than 5 °.

This thesis details a series of experiments which were conducted to investigate the heat transfer and pressure drop distributions in tube bundles during both dropwise and filmwise condensation of steam.

It {{is also used}} in industrial applications such as water harvesting, desalination systems, thermal management and power generation. Filmwise condensation is commonly found in nature, but <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> is preferred due to the higher heat and mass transfer coefficients and lower thermal resistance. However <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> is difficult to obtain and sustain, so micro- and nano-structured surfaces have been studied as the most promising way to achieve it. Bio-inspired surfaces designed mimicking natural surface structures have achieved high degree of superhydrophobicity and extraordinary characteristics like self-cleaning and low adhesion, but some disadvantages for the <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> process have been discovered as the reduction of heat transfer performance during nucleation and growing stages or the low durability. One {{of the most important}} steps on <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> is the droplet removal before the flooding of the surface. Self induced out of plane jumping has been studied several times, but as the condensation process is run, it seems to be too slow to regenerate the surfaces and remove efficiently the droplets. Some additional mechanisms were studied to enhance this process as the electrostatic improvement of the droplet removal, but recently, a new promising mechanism has been reported for the first time. The sweeping droplet removal mechanism shows that it s faster than the jumping droplet removal mechanism, but there is not enough experience or evidence around this topic. The main objectives of this thesis are design and fabricate different microstructured surfaces for promoting <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation,</b> enhancing the heat transfer performance, and the design and fabrication of an experimental setup for the visualization of the condensation process.

40|$|Within {{the types}} of {{condensation}} that can form on a surface, <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> has been previously shown to produce condensation heat transfer coefficients up to {{an order of magnitude}} greater than film condensation. Among <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> investigations, it has also been shown that smaller droplets result in higher heat transfer coefficients. An area that is currently under investigation within condensation advancements is creating superhydrophobic surfaces that can sustain smaller droplets during condensation. However, as droplet diameters are reduced to sizes comparable to the flow's mean free path, various mechanisms are expected to affect transport as the flow transitions from a continuum to free molecular flow: non-continuum transport effects, curvature effects on surface tension and on saturation conditions, and interactions with nearby droplets. In this dissertation, we investigate the limits of heat transfer performance on surfaces that strive to sustain <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> for smaller droplets. We explore and compare the limitations of <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> as mean droplet sizes are reduced to micro and nanoscales using three different models: one that uses an approximation for micro and nanoscale transport on an array of droplets, one that uses the DSMC method to simulate transport on a single droplet, and a third model that uses the DSMC method to simulate transport on an array of droplets. We found the three different models to show similar trends; <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> heat transfer coefficients increased as droplet sizes were reduced, but only up to a certain point where non-continuum transport and curvature effects became significant. For pure steam condensing on a cold wall at standard atmospheric condition with 3 degrees Celsius of subcooling, drop- wise condensation heat transfer coefficients were found to peak when droplets approached diameters near 200 nm.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} use of three classes {{advanced}} materials for promoting dropwise condensation: 1. robust hydrophobic functionalizations 2. superhydrophobic textures 3. lubricant-imbibed textures We first define the functional requirements of a hydrophobic functionalization for promoting <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> and use these guidelines to investigate two subclasses of materials: rare-earth ceramics and fluoropolymer films deposited via initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD). We show how both materials exhibit robust dropwise behavior, and further subject an iCVD film to an accelerated endurance trial to show how it sustains <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> throughout a 3 -month equivalent trial. Next we combine hydrophobic functionalization with rough texture to obtain superhydrophobic surfaces and identify a self-similar depinning mechanism governing adhesion on surfaces with multiple roughness length scales. We introduce the metric of pinned fraction to show how these surfaces must be designed to minimize adhesion. We then show how <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> on superhydrophobic surfaces and the ensuing "jumping" behavior consists of not only binary coalescences, but multiple-drop coalescences with tangential departure that result in increased departing mass flux. However, we find that although this mode of condensation is readily achievable when condensing working fluids with high surface tension, such as water, even re-entrant structures that are known to support millimetric droplets of low-surface tension liquids in a superhydrophobic state are not sufficient to promote the dropwise mode of condensation for working fluids with low surface tension. Finally, we extend the applicability of textured surfaces by imbibing solid textures with a lubricant stabilized by capillary wicking. We show how these surfaces, when both solid texture and lubricant are properly designed, can promote <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> and reduce departing diameter of not only steam, but also of low-surface tension working fluids. In summary, we find that all three classes of surfaces provide significant increases in vapor-side heat transfer coefficient. However, when considering the {{overall heat transfer coefficient}} of a surface condenser, we find that most of the benefits of <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> can be realized by hydrophobic functionalization. by Adam T.

This process has a great importance in analyzing and manufacturing of condensers, heat exchangers and other steam operating devices. In the <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> there are two main mechanisms for droplet growth. When the droplets are smaller than the half of the mean distance between two drops, they grow by absorbing water molecules from the gas phase, and for droplets bigger than this amount the mechanism is the droplets coalescence which means joining of the neighboring drops to form a new bigger drop. In the current study, the process of <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> was modeled using a computer program considering both absorption and coalescence. Then the results of this model were compared to experimental results using Ripley function method...|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} selectively setting <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> on a surface (1) of a substrate (2) and to a substrate that is structured on its surface by this method. This involves directing an ion beam (3, 3 ') onto the surface (1) of the substrate (2) for the implantation of ions into the surface (1) and a resultant structuring of the surface (1). The ion beam (3, 3 ') impinges on the surface (1) at an angle that is inclined by between 30 DEG and 80 DEG {{with respect to a}} normal (4) to the surface.

40|$|<b>Dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> of {{atmospheric}} water vapor {{is important in}} multiple practical engineering applications. The roles of environmental factors and surface morphology/chemistry on the condensation dynamics need to be better understood to enable efficient water-harvesting, dehumidication, and other psychrometric processes. Systems and surfaces that promote faster condensation rates and self-shedding of condensate droplets could lead to improved mass transfer rates and higher water yields in harvesting applications. The thesis presents the design and construction of an experimental facility that allows visualization of the condensation process {{as a function of}} relative humidity. <b>Dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> experiments are performed on a vertically oriented, hydrophobic surface at a controlled relative humidity and surface subcooling temperature. The distribution and growth of water droplets are monitored across the surface at different relative humidities (45 %, 50 %, 55 %, and 70 %) at a constant surface subcooling temperature of 15 °C below the ambient temperature. The droplet growth dynamics exhibits a strong dependency on relative humidity in the early stages during which there is a large population of small droplets on the surface and single droplet growth dominates over coalescence effects. At later stages, the dynamics of droplet growth is insensitive to relative humidity due to the dominance of coalescence effects. The overall volumetric rate of condensation on the surface is also assessed as a function of time and ambient relative humidity. Low relative humidity conditions not only slow the absolute rate of condensation, but also prolong an initial transient regime over which the condensation rate remains significantly below the steady-state value. The current state-of-the-art in <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> research indicates the need for systematic experimental investigations as a function of relative humidity. The improved understanding of the relative humidity effects on the growth of single and distributed droplets offered in this thesis can improve the prediction of heat and mass transfer during <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> of humid air under differing environmental conditions. This knowledge can be used to engineer condenser systems and surfaces that are adapted for local ambient relative humidity and temperature conditions. ...|$|E

To reduce water usage, compact condensers {{are required to}} enable air-cooled condensers and reduce infrastructure costs. Steam flow condensation was studied in 0. 952 -mm and 1. 82 -mm hydraulic diameter mini-gaps in an open loop experimental apparatus. The apparatus was validated with single-phase flow. Flow condensation experiments were conducted {{for a wide range}} of steam mass fluxes (i. e., 35 – 100 kg/m²s) and qualities (i. e., 0. 2 – 0. 9) in hydrophilic copper and hydrophobic Teflon-coated channels. Water contact angles were 70 ° and 110 ° on copper and Teflon, respectively, and in general, filmwise condensation was the primary condensation mode in the hydrophilic channel and <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> was the primary mode observed in the hydrophobic channel. Pressure drops were reduced by 50 – 80 % in the hydrophobic channels. Condensation heat transfer was enhanced by 200 – 350 % in hydrophobic mini-gaps over hydrophilic mini-gap due to <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation.</b> Droplet dynamics (e. g., nucleation, coalescence and departure) were quantified during <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation.</b> A model was created which includes droplet adhesion and drag forces for droplet departure diameters which were then correlated to heat transfer coefficients. An overall mean absolute error of 9. 6 % was achieved without curve fitting. Noncondensable gases can reduce heat transfer in industrial systems, such as power plants due to the additional layer of thermal resistance from the gas. Condensing steam-nitrogen experiments were conducted for nitrogen mass fractions of 0 – 30 %; the addition of nitrogen reduced heat transfer coefficients by up to 59 % and 30 % in hydrophilic and hydrophobic mini-gaps, respectively. It was found that during <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation,</b> the noncondensable layer was perturbed by cyclical droplet motion, and therefore heat transfer coefficients were increased by 2 – 5 times compared with filmwise condensation of the same mass fraction of nitrogen...|$|E
40|$|Vapor {{condensation}} {{is routinely}} {{used as an}} effective means of transferring heat, with <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> exhibiting a 5 [*]−[*] 7 x heat transfer improvement compared to filmwise condensation. However, state-of-the-art techniques to promote <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> rely on functional hydrophobic coatings, which are often not robust and therefore undesirable for industrial implementation. Natural surface contamination due to hydrocarbon adsorption, particularly on noble metals, has been explored as an alternative approach to realize stable dropwise condensing surfaces. While noble metals are prohibitively expensive, the recent discovery of robust rare earth oxide (REO) hydrophobicity has generated interest for <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation</b> applications due to material costs approaching 1 % of gold; however, the underlying mechanism of REO hydrophobicity remains under debate. In this work, we show through careful experiments and modeling that REO hydrophobicity occurs due to the same hydrocarbon adsorption mechanism seen previously on noble metals. To investigate adsorption dynamics, we studied holmia and ceria REOs, along with control samples of gold and silica, via X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and dynamic time-resolved contact angle measurements. The contact angle and surface carbon percent started at ≈ 0 on in-situ argon-plasma-cleaned samples and increased asymptotically over time after exposure to laboratory air, with the rare earth oxides displaying hydrophobic (> 90 °) advancing contact angle behavior at long times (> 4 days). The results indicate that REOs are in fact hydrophilic when clean and become hydrophobic due to hydrocarbon adsorption. Furthermore, this study provides insight into how REOs can be used to promote stable <b>dropwise</b> <b>condensation,</b> which is important for the development of enhanced phase change surfaces.
