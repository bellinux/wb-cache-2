30|$|We {{give the}} {{following}} important lemmas {{which will be}} used <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> result.|$|R
60|$|This {{side of his}} {{proposals}} we will proceed to consider <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> chapter.|$|R
30|$|Each {{of these}} {{questions}} will be briefly addressed <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> section for <b>our</b> example CAS.|$|R
30|$|The {{straightening}} {{out of the}} second-order Benjiamin-Ono flows by the Abel map is showed <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> result.|$|R
30|$|We derive the {{corresponding}} Green’s function for {{boundary value problem}} (1.1), which will play major role <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> analysis.|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} {{result is}} used <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> considerations. It is a generalization of [4], Lemma 2.5 in Menger PbM-spaces.|$|R
30|$|<b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> result, {{we study}} {{the degree of}} {{approximation}} for the bivariate operators {{by means of the}} Lipschitz class.|$|R
30|$|We derive the {{corresponding}} Green’s function for the {{boundary value problem}} (1.1) which will play major role <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> analysis.|$|R
30|$|A second {{consequence}} of Lemma  4.1 has independent interest (notice that the set A <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> corollary {{need not be}} an interval).|$|R
30|$|<b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> work, we {{will focus}} on how to restore spoiled {{character}} structures for the reason of preserving the beauty of art work.|$|R
3000|$|<b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> theorem, we {{determine}} {{the order of}} approximation for functions in a weighted space of continuous functions on [0,∞ [...]) by M_n operators.|$|R
60|$|Being {{now ready}} to be {{launched}} from her cradle into the sea--her future home--we will proceed <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> chapter to describe the process of launching.|$|R
30|$|We {{intend to}} do the {{implementation}} of those results <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> work. The extension of this discretization to the three dimensional axisymmetric domain is presently under consideration.|$|R
30|$|<b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> example we unify and generalize the inequalities in Examples 17 and 19 by {{presenting}} {{a scale of}} inequalities between these inequalities (a genuine Hardy-Hilbert inequality).|$|R
60|$|The Letter against Inoculating the Small Pox, (Sign'd Absinthium) {{giving an}} Account of the Number of Persons who have dy'd under that Operation, will be Inserted <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next.</b>|$|R
3000|$|<b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> theorem, we {{obtain the}} degree of {{approximation}} of the M_n operators for functions in the space C_ 2 [0,∞ [...]) {{in terms of the}} classical modulus of continuity.|$|R
30|$|However, {{in order}} to {{highlight}} {{the roles of the}} different types of admissible discontinuity curves (which we shall define <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> section), we are going to use a different, not so simple, reformulation of (3.1).|$|R
60|$|We {{are drawing}} very near to man. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> section {{we shall have}} to {{describe}} the strangest of all these precursors of humanity, the Neanderthalers, {{the men who were}} almost, but not quite, true men.|$|R
30|$|The {{existence}} {{of a pair of}} well-ordered piecewise continuous lower and upper solutions implies the {{existence of}} a better pair of continuous lower and upper solutions. We establish this more precisely <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> proposition. Note that the proof is constructive.|$|R
60|$|That {{our hero}} was {{not content to}} rest upon the laurels thus {{gathered}} in the far north, but longed to act the part of pioneer over the Rocky Mountains into the far west, shall be made plain <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> chapter.|$|R
30|$|<b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> step, we {{show that}} T is upper semicontinuous. It is well known [24], Proposition  1.2, that T will be upper semicontinuous if we prove {{that it has a}} closed graph, since T is already shown to be {{completely}} continuous.|$|R
30|$|In this example, we fix {{the initial}} guess at q^(0)= 1. We should mention here that any initial guess is possible. We will show <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> example that the {{presence}} of perturbation or noise in the control has limited influences on the optimization algorithm.|$|R
5000|$|The public pressue and Boeke's {{withdrawal}} subsequently led Utopia {{to change}} their decision. The company revealed [...] "We are certainly ready to include the film <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> screening schedule, as the original message we sought to get across via the cancelation has achieved,".|$|R
40|$|A smart {{investment}} <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> generation Maternity Support Services (MSS) lowers {{the chances that}} atrisk women will have low birth weight babies, which can result in expensive hospital stays, life-long health problems or even death. One {{out of every three}} pregnant women <b>in</b> <b>our</b> state receives MSS to supplement prenatal care...|$|R
30|$|In [14] it {{has been}} shown that time scales {{considered}} in Examples 2.16 and 2.17 are almost periodic time scales. <b>In</b> fact, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> corollary we shall show that all concepts of almost periodic time scales discussed in [13, 14] are actually changing-periodic time scales.|$|R

60|$|The {{first house}} we entered, {{after a little}} {{difficulty}} with the window, was a small semi-detached villa, and I found nothing eatable left in the place but some mouldy cheese.

40|$|In this column, {{we offer}} a {{panoramic}} view of the current contours of the rules governing prosecutors that is more nuanced than the one suggested by descriptions of prosecutor ethics as simply different, special, or extraordinary. We do not address here the various rationales that might be offered for creating distinct rules for prosecutors-a topic we will address <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> column...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn early May, a {{new series}} of {{international}} conferences began, choosing as its first venue the Pan Pacific Hotel in Singapore. Not only was this a great success in attracting quality presentations, it was well-attended by delegates and companies eager to experience for themselves this exciting region. Our LDSD 95 coverage begins with this introductory overview and will continue in more depth <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> issue...|$|R
