5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is good enough for me.|$|E

The film was shown in highly stylized circular theaters, and featured historic and futuristic details both on the interior and exterior.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the priesthood}} in the Episcopal Church was {{restricted}} to men only, as was true of most other Christian denominations prior to the mid-20th century and still true for some. Objections to {{the ordination of women}} have been different <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> place to place. Some believe that it is fundamentally impossible for a woman to be validly ordained, while others believe it is possible but inappropriate. Considerations cited include local social conditions, ecumenical implications, or the symbolic character of the priesthood, an ancient tradition including an all male priesthood, as well as certain biblical texts.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Kings of the Picts were derived from a sept of the Eóganachta. If so, then the Eóganacht Locha Léin, and thus the ancestors of the O'Moriartys and others, are the most obvious candidates. Not only were they at one point expansive as the powerful Kingdom of Iarmuman, but they were also frustrated by their exclusion and forced isolation by the inner circle. Glaringly, they were said to descend from a Pictish woman, and this was sometimes given as the reason for their isolation. The inner circle exhibited peculiar attitudes <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> so this could have been the real story.|$|E
25|$|Jews {{under the}} Muslim rule rarely faced martyrdom or exile, or forced {{conversion}} {{and they were}} fairly free to choose their residence and profession. Their freedom and economic condition varied <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> place to place. Forced conversions occurred mostly in the Maghreb, especially under the Almohads, a militant dynasty with messianic claims, {{as well as in}} Persia, where Shi'a Muslims were generally less tolerant than their Sunni counterparts. Notable examples of the cases where the choice of residence was taken away from them includes confining Jews to walled quarters (mellahs) in Morocco beginning from the 15th century and especially since the early 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{while the}} Prime Minister has {{a measure of}} {{latitude}} in deciding when to hold a by-election, the Court reiterated that {{this does not mean}} that the Prime Minister is entitled to defer the calling of an election to fill a vacancy indefinitely, or to simply declare that he will not be advising the President to issue a writ of election. The Court opined that even if at a particular point in time the Prime Minister felt that it would not be appropriate to call for an election to fill a vacancy, he would still be compelled to review the circumstances <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> call one if and when the circumstances changed.|$|E
