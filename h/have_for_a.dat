The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new programme which will follow the trials and tribulations {{of a group of}} people left to fend for themselves on a remote island. In this respect, the play is often cited as having anticipated the craze for reality television.|$|E
25|$|The kiss on {{the lips}} can be {{performed}} between two friends or family. This move aims to express the affection that you <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> friend. Unlike kissing for love, a friendly kiss has no sexual connotation. The {{kiss on the}} lips is a practice {{that can be found}} in the time of Patriarchs (Bible). In Ancient Greece, the kiss on the mouth was used to express a concept of equality between people of the same rank. In the Middle Ages, the kiss of peace was recommended by the Catholic Church. The kiss on the lips was also common among knights. The gesture has again become popular with young people, particularly in England.|$|E

25|$|Pittas {{were first}} {{described}} scientifically by Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in his revised 12th {{edition of the}} Systema Naturae. He placed the Indian pitta in the crow family and genus Corvus. Ten years later it {{was placed in the}} thrush family, due to similarities of morphology and behaviour, before being placed in its own genus, Pitta in 1816 by Louis Vieillot. Vieillot was also the first to consider the genus a family in its own right. The family's closest relatives <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time assumed to be the other suboscine birds, and particularly the Old World broadbills and asities (formerly treated as two families, now either lumped into one or split into four). A 2006 study confirmed that these were the closest relatives of the pittas.|$|E
25|$|Scientists <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{long time}} been {{interested}} {{in the relationship between}} testosterone and aggressive behavior. In most species, males are more aggressive than females. Castration of males usually has a pacifying effect on aggressive behavior in males. In humans, males engage in crime and especially violent crime more than females. The involvement in crime usually rises in the early teens to mid teens which happen {{at the same time as}} testosterone levels rise. Research on the relationship between testosterone and aggression is difficult since the only reliable measurement of brain testosterone is by a lumbar puncture which is not done for research purposes. Studies therefore have often instead used more unreliable measurements from blood or saliva.|$|E

25|$|There is {{biological}} {{variation in}} the human species—with traits such as blood type, cranial features, eye color, hair color and type, height and build, and skin color varying across the globe. Human body types vary substantially. The typical height of an adult human is between , although this varies significantly depending, among other things, on sex and ethnic origin. Body size is partly determined by genes and is also significantly influenced by environmental factors such as diet, exercise, and sleep patterns, especially as an influence in childhood. Adult height for each sex in a particular ethnic group approximately follows a normal distribution. Those aspects of genetic variation that give clues to human evolutionary history, or are relevant to medical research, have received particular attention. For example, the genes that allow adult humans to digest lactose are present in high frequencies in populations that have long histories of cattle domestication, suggesting natural selection having favored that gene in populations that depend on cow milk. Some hereditary diseases such as sickle cell anemia are frequent in populations where malaria has been endemic throughout history—it is believed that the same gene gives increased resistance to malaria {{among those who are}} unaffected carriers of the gene. Similarly, populations that <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time inhabited specific climates, such as arctic or tropical regions or high altitudes, tend to have developed specific phenotypes that are beneficial for conserving energy in those environments—short stature and stocky build in cold regions, tall and lanky in hot regions, and with high lung capacities at high altitudes. Similarly, skin color varies clinally with darker skin around the equator—where the added protection from the sun's ultraviolet radiation is thought to give an evolutionary advantage—and lighter skin tones closer to the poles.|$|E
500|$|Lionel {{also has}} a key {{relationship}} with Martha Kent, Clark Kent's adoptive mother. This relationship first develops in season two when Lionel hires Martha to be his assistant; it is further developed in season five. Glover felt Lionel's attraction to Martha grows in season five when Jonathan Kent dies because he now sees Martha as a single woman and is now more attainable; Glover believes Lionel was seeking to attain Martha's [...] "goodness" [...] and the attraction {{is not based on}} lust. When Lionel is in Martha's company he tries to present himself as a man she could be with; he consciously attempts to change years of selfish behavior. Writer Holly Harold said his relationship with Martha parallels Lex's relationship with Lana; both men believe these two women will be their saving grace and pull them back from the dark side. Annette O'Toole said Martha's interest in Lionel is like watching a dangerous animal; [...] "It's that attraction you <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very beautiful, dangerous animal. You know you can't stop watching it, {{but at the same time}} you feel, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill me.'" [...] O'Toole also said she believes Martha's motivation is to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When Martha left the show, writer Todd Slavkin said they wanted to give the character [...] "more of a send-off" [...] than they achieved on screen. Slavkin said they could do nothing equivalent to what they gave John Schneider because there were so many storylines by the season six finale they could fit nothing else in. The writers realized they could not kill off the character so they sent her to the U.S. Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage. O'Toole and Al Gough said Martha has a small attraction to Lionel and that nothing serious would come from it.|$|E
500|$|O'Toole {{relished the}} {{opportunity}} {{that came with}} Jonathan's passing, {{even though she was}} saddened to see a friend leave the show. Martha taking the senate seat was a chance to explore more adult stories with her character beginning midway through season five, which was important for the actress since Clark was becoming an adult on the show. It also allowed for O'Toole the chance to depict [...] "strong emotions" [...] over Jonathan's death. Al Gough feels that Jonathan's passing allowed for them to explore more of Martha's smart and strong side, as well as her relationship with Lionel. The idea was to show that there was some form of attraction between Martha and Lionel, but that Martha would never have any romantic relationship with the billionaire, especially after all that he had done to her family. O'Toole likens Martha's interest in Lionel with that of watching a dangerous animal: [...] "It's that attraction you <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very beautiful, dangerous animal. You know you can't stop watching it, {{but at the same time}} you feel, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill me.'" [...] The actress believes that Martha's ultimate motivation was to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When it came time for Martha to leave the show, writer Todd Slavkin contends that they wanted to give the character [...] "more of a send-off" [...] than they achieved on film. Slavkin explains that they could not do anything equivalent to what they gave John Schneider, as there were already so many storylines going on by the season six finale that they could not fit anything else in. The writers also realized that they could not kill off the character, and so chose to send her to the US Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage.|$|E

2500|$|Off balance sheet: Derivative (finance) of {{many types}} {{have in the}} past been {{referred}} to as [...] "off-balance-sheet." [...] This term implies that the use of derivatives has no balance sheet impact. While there are differences among the various accounting standards internationally, there is a general trend towards the requirement to record derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet. There is also a generally accepted principle that, where derivatives are being used as a hedge against underlying assets or liabilities, accounting adjustments are required to ensure that the gain/loss on the hedged instrument is recognized in the income statement on a similar basis as the underlying assets and liabilities.

2500|$|A {{reinforcing}} (rebar) ironworker, colloquially {{known as}} a [...] "Rodbuster", works with reinforcing bars to make structures based on a certain design. [...] Reinforcing ironworkers assemble structures with reinforcing bars by tying the bars together with tie wire. [...] They place the rebar inside of forms, so concrete can be poured over [...] top of them to form a solid structure. When reinforcing floors, concrete blocks are used to raise the rebar off of the deck, so no rebar can be seen underneath of {{the deck of the}} floor after the forms are stripped. In addition, ironworkers often have to cut the steel that they <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> job to fit into certain positions. [...] For example, the rebar will have to be cut with a cutting torch, so it can fit around a drain. [...] In some instances, welded wire fabric is used to help strengthen concrete; however, it is difficult to place this fabric in the concrete because it must be placed while the concrete is being poured into the forms.|$|E
