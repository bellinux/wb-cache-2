40|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of output {{waveform}} distortion due to the pipes and wires' tension in a long-stroke <b>horizontal</b> vibration <b>table,</b> a follow-up-gear design technology was put forward which drove the pipes and wires to move synchronously with the slipway. The electromechanical coupling kinetic model of a <b>horizontal</b> vibration <b>table</b> was analyzed considering the tension of pipes and wires in it, and the influences of tension forces of the pipes and wires on the output waveform distortion of the <b>horizontal</b> vibration <b>table</b> was calculated. A follow-up gear for the slipway was developed based on a precise linear encoder, and drove a following table moving synchronously with the slipway. And the pipes and wires on the slipway were led out through the following table, on which the tension forces directly acted, but the tension force on the slipway drove to zero. The experimental results indicate that the output waveform distortion improves greatly after adding the follow-up gear when the <b>horizontal</b> vibration <b>table</b> works in long-stroke and ultra-low-frequency motion...|$|R

They consist {{of three or}} more upright stones {{supporting}} a large flat <b>horizontal</b> capstone (<b>table).</b> Most of them {{are to be found}} in two main concentrations, one in the southeast of the island and one in the north. The Knockeen and Gaulstown Dolmens in County Waterford are exceptional examples.|$|R
5000|$|Triangulation {{surveys were}} based on a few {{carefully}} measured baselines and a series of angles. The initial baseline was measured with great accuracy, since the accuracy of the subsequent survey was critically dependent upon it. Various corrections were applied, principally temperature. An especially accurate folding chain was used, laid on <b>horizontal</b> <b>tables,</b> all shaded from the sun and with a constant tension. The early surveys made use of large and bulky theodolites made by William Carey, a Zenith sector made by Jesse Ramsden and 100-foot chains. Later surveys used more compact theodolites. Accurate instruments could not always be purchased through the standard system of government contract and Everest personally supervised the construction of instruments. He had a maker, Henry Barrow, set up an instrument company in Calcutta. For a while Barrow was succeeded by Syed Mohsin from Arcot and after his death the instruments were supplied by Cooke from York.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike most {{types of}} {{woodworking}} machinery, the {{radial arm saw}} has a clear genesis: it was invented by Raymond De Walt of Bridgeton, New Jersey. DeWalt applied for patents in 1923, which were issued in 1925 (US Patent 1,528,536). [...] DeWalt and others subsequently patented many variations on the original, but DeWalt's original design (sold under the moniker Wonder Worker) remained the most successful: a circular saw blade directly driven by an electric motor held in a yoke sliding along a horizontal arm that is some distance above a <b>horizontal</b> <b>table</b> surface. A saw which combines the sliding and compound features {{is known as a}} sliding compound miter saw or SCMS.|$|E
50|$|Alidade tables {{have also}} long {{been used in}} fire towers for {{sighting}} the bearing to a forest fire. A topographic map of the local area, with a suitable scale, is oriented, centered and permanently mounted on a leveled circular table surrounded by an arc calibrated to true north of the map and graduated in degrees (and fractions) of arc. Two vertical sight apertures are {{arranged opposite each other}} and can be rotated along the graduated arc of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>table.</b> To determine a bearing to a suspected fire, the user looks through the two sights and adjusts them until they are aligned with the source of the smoke (or an observed lightning strike to be monitored for smoke). See Osborne Fire Finder.|$|E
50|$|Angles are {{measured}} using a sine bar {{with the help}} of gauge blocks and a dial gauge or a spirit level. The aim of a measurement is to measure the surface on which the dial gauge or spirit level is placed horizontally. For example, to measure the angle of a wedge, the wedge is placed on a <b>horizontal</b> <b>table.</b> The sine bar is placed over the inclined surface of the wedge. At this position, the top surface of the sine bar is inclined the same amount as the wedge. Using gauge blocks, the top surface is made horizontal. The sine of the angle of inclination of the wedge is the ratio of the height of the gauge blocks used and the distance between the centers of the cylinders.|$|E

5000|$|The {{system is}} {{composed}} of a topographic map of the area oriented and centered on a <b>horizontal</b> <b>table</b> with a circular rim graduated in degrees (and fractions). Two sighting apertures are mounted above the map {{on opposite sides of}} the ring and slide around the arc.The device is used by moving the sights until the observer can peek through the nearer sighting hole and view the cross hairs in the further sight aligned with the fire. The fire lookout notes the degrees on the graduated ring beneath the sight. Early Fire Finders were capable of a crude estimate of elevation based upon the level and elevation of the table, calculating distance and rough position of the fire by reference to any distinctive terrain features and by use of the scale shown on the map. However, in actual practice, fire distance and location were normally established using two or more Fire Finder-equipped towers, using the intersection method to fix the precise location of the fire. [...] Dispatchers at a central facility used a compass rose to mark lines of position from each reporting tower onto a large map to quickly find where the reported bearings intersect.|$|E

Our target is insert objects on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>table</b> into the corresponding location on {{the hole in the}} vertical plate. First, we find two dominant planes corresponding to the horizontal and vertical table by processing 3 D points by Kinect. Then, we find each object on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>table</b> using contour processing. Also, object on the vertical plane is processed using the same algorithm. Finally, object matching is done using Hu invariant moments...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{an improved}} linear modeling method for multi axis electro-hydraulically actuated servo systems {{to enable the}} design of high performance and robust Hâ controllers. The model is validated for a Multi Axis Simulation Table (MAST) located at the University of Bath. The dynamic analysis of the MAST proves {{the effectiveness of the}} modeling technique compared with conventional methods. Based on the validated linear model, the uncertainties of the system, as determined from parameter estimation errors and system nonlinearities, are quantified. This leads to the design of an H â, controller for the MAST. The simulated performance of this controller is then compared with that of a classical PI controller. In this paper, the control potential is demonstrated for <b>horizontal</b> <b>table</b> motion...|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "vertical turret lathe" [...] (VTL) {{is applied}} to {{machines}} wherein the same essential design of the horizontal version is upended, which allows the headstock {{to sit on the}} floor and the faceplate to become a <b>horizontal</b> rotating <b>table,</b> analogous to a huge potter's wheel. This is useful for the handling of very large, heavy, short workpieces. Vertical lathes in general are also called [...] "vertical boring mills" [...] or often simply [...] "boring mills"; therefore a vertical turret lathe is a vertical boring mill equipped with a turret. A CNC version is called a [...] "CNC VTL".|$|R

Here, we describe our analysis of how people initially organize collections of familiar images. We asked 26 subjects in pairs to organize 50 images on a common <b>horizontal</b> <b>table.</b> Each pair then organized a different 50 -image set on a computer table of identical surface area. The bottom-projected computer tabletop displayed our interface to several online, pilebased affordances we wished to evaluate. Subjects used pens {{to interact with the}} system. We highlight aspects of the computer environment that were notably important to subjects and others that they cared about less than we had hypothesized. For example, a strong majority preferred computer-generated representations of piles to be gridshaped over several alternatives, some of which mimicked the physical world closely and others that used transparency to save space...|$|E
40|$|The Rattleback is a {{very popular}} science toy shown to {{students}} {{all over the world}} to demonstrate the non-triviality of rotational motion. When spun on a <b>horizontal</b> <b>table,</b> this boat-shaped object behaves in a peculiar way. Although the object appears symmetric, the dynamics of its motion seem very asymmetric. When spun in the preferred direction, it spins smoothly, whereas in the other direction it starts to oscillate wildly. The oscillation soon dies out and the rattleback starts to spin in the preferred way. We will construct and go through an analytical model capable of explaining this behaviour in a simple and intelligible way. Although we aim at a semi-pedagogical treatise, we will study the details only when they are necessary to understand the calculation. After presenting the calculations we will discuss the physical validity of our assumptions and take a look at more sophisticated models requiring numerical analysis. We will then improve our model by assuming a simple friction force. Comment: 17 pages and 2 figures, typos corrected, some minor additions and rewording...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Multidimensional {{data are}} used in popular to support OLAP(On-Line Analytical Processing) {{operations}} efficiently. Many OLAP tools {{have been developed to}} manipulate the multidimensional data to provide users with useful information for decision making. While they are equipped with useful features, they seem be sometimes complicated to relational database users. In this paper, we developed an easy and effective interface manipulating multidimensional data on the top of relational DBMSs. The proposed interface provides a mechanism handling data in relational tables like spreadsheet (e. g., Microsoft Excel) does. Spreadsheet is the most popular tool for end users to analysis their data conveniently. The interface provides the features browsing relational tables virtually with sheet by sheet and creating pivot tables. Pivot tables are a useful presentation form of multidimensional data, which have attribute values (not attribute names) as their columns thus have horizontal format. We store pivot tables of horizontal format as vertical tables in relational DBMSs and we provide the transformation of queries on <b>horizontal</b> <b>table</b> into ones on vertical tables. With this user-friendly interface, users will be able to perform analysis activities on data in relational DBMSs easily and effectively...|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{possible}} elements is not known. A very early suggestion made by Elliot Adams in 1911, {{and based on the}} arrangement of elements in each <b>horizontal</b> periodic <b>table</b> row, was that elements of atomic weight greater than 256Â± (which would equate to between elements 99 and 100 in modern-day terms) did not exist. A higherâmore recentâestimate is that the periodic table may end soon after the island of stability, which is expected to centre around element 126, as the extension of the periodic and nuclides tables is restricted by proton and neutron drip lines.

30|$|An {{approach}} {{similar to}} that of UltrÃ©-GuÃ©rard et al. (1998 a) was already employed in the context of IGRF modeling, but this was to test the quality of the candidate models rather than to propose a new model (Mandea and Langlais 2000). Here, we combine direct measurements of the position of the geomagnetic equator (i.e., vertical field measurements) to scalar measurements. The new model will not depend on the possibly more perturbed <b>horizontal</b> components (<b>Table</b> 1), and mismatch between B and F (below 50 Â° absolute magnetic latitude) should not introduce any intrinsic error. This latter point is however debatable, as even the intensity of the measured vertical field depends on the measured F ASM value through the calibration process.|$|R
