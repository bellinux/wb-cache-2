40|$|Abstract—This paper {{explores the}} {{combination}} of inertial sensor data with vision. Visual and inertial sensing are two sensory modalities that can be explored to give robust solutions on image segmentation and recovery of 3 D structure from images, increasing the capabilities of autonomous robots and enlarging the application potential of vision systems. In biological systems, the {{information provided by the}} vestibular system is fused at a very early processing stage with vision, playing a key role on the execution of visual movements such as gaze holding and tracking, and the visual cues aid the spatial orientation and body equilibrium. In this paper, we set a framework for using inertial sensor data in vision systems, and describe some results obtained. The unit sphere projection camera model is used, providing a simple model for inertial data integration. Using the vertical reference provided by the inertial sensors, the <b>image</b> <b>horizon</b> line can be determined. Using just one vanishing point and the vertical, we can recover the camera’s focal distance and provide an external bearing for the system’s navigation frame of reference. Knowing the geometry of a stereo rig and its pose from the inertial sensors, the collineation of level planes can be recovered, providing enough restrictions to segment and reconstruct vertical features and leveled planar patches.

40|$|To map the 3 D {{distribution}} of major hydrologic boundaries {{in a shallow}} aquifer near Boise, Idaho, 3 D seismic-reflection data and multifold, pseudo- 3 D ground-penetrating- radar (GPR) data were analyzed. The seismic data covered a 75 -X 70 -m area and <b>imaged</b> <b>horizons</b> from 18 to 150 m deep. The 10 -fold, 50 -MHz GPR data were acquired on a 20 - X 30 -m grid using a multichannel GPR system and offsets ranging from 2 m to 20 m. By correlating the well-resolved GPR depth image with a clay-aquitard seismic reflection, the seismic-velocity model was improved substantially and {{the accuracy of the}} final interpretation was improved. The resulting clay-aquitard surface differed by 0. 12 + 0. 46 m from the depth to clay measured in wells. By integrating the interpretations of the GPR and seismic data, a 3 D map of major hydrostratigraphic boundaries was produced...|$|R

40|$|J. Opt. Soc. Am. A, Volume 12, No. 5, pp. 950 - 957 (May 1995) At any {{instant the}} optical effects of {{atmospheric}} turbulence {{can result in}} a somewhat distorted image. As a consequence, the <b>image</b> of the <b>horizon</b> that ought to appear to be a smooth straight line may instead appear somewhat irregular. When we consider turbulence effects we call into question the idea that a small object that we expect to see just above the horizon will stand out (i [...] e., will be detectable) because it appears as a bump on what is otherwise a smooth straight horizon line. The degree of irregularity that turbulence may be expected to introduce in the <b>image</b> of the <b>horizon</b> is studied, and a theory that permits evaluation of the vertical irregularity as a function of horizontal extent is developed. It is concluded that for a sample case the effect is small but that, for an object close enough to the horizon line, the detection of this object could be interfered with by this effect...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For {{navigation}} of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), atti-tude estimation is essential. We {{present a}} method for attitude estimation (pitch and roll angle) from aerial fisheye <b>images</b> through <b>horizon</b> detec-tion. The method is based on edge detection and a probabilistic Hough voting scheme. In a flight scenario, there is often some prior knowledge of the vehicle altitude and attitude. We exploit this prior to make the atti-tude estimation more robust by letting the edge pixel votes be weighted based on the probability distributions for the altitude and pitch and roll angles. The method does not require any sky/ground segmentation as most horizon detection methods do. Our method has been evaluated on aerial fisheye images from the internet. The horizon is robustly detected in all tested images. The deviation in the attitude estimate between our automated horizon detection and a manual detection is less than 1 ◦...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 20 Loop Current eddy {{separation}} event dates {{were derived from}} Seasat and ERS- 1 satellite altimetry, Coastal Zone Color Scanner chlorophyll-a images, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer sea surface temperature <b>images,</b> <b>Horizon</b> Marine, Inc. EddyWatch(TM) reports, and Climatology and Simulation of Eddies Eddy Joint Industry Project Gulf Eddy Model analyses spanning mid- 1978 - 1992. There were many inconsistencies between the new 2 ̆ 2 pre-altimetry 2 ̆ 2 reanalysis dates derived from mostly non-altimeter data and dates published in past literature based on earlier versions of the pre-altimetry record. The reanalysis dates were derived from a larger compilation of data types and, consequently, were not as affected by intermittent and seasonal data outages common with past records. Therefore, the reanalysis dates are likely more accurate. About 30 Loop Current eddy separation dates were derived from altimetry data spanning 1993 - 2012. The pre-altimetry and altimetry reanalysis dates along with similar altimetry dates published in other literature exhibit statistically significant seasonality. Eddy separation events are more likely in the months March, August, and September, and less likely in December. Reanalysis event dates were objectively divided into 2 ̆ 2 spring 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 fall 2 ̆ 2 seasons using a k-means clustering algorithm. The estimated spring and fall season centers are March 2 nd and August 23 rd, respectively, with seasonal boundaries on May 22 nd and December 3 rd. The altimetry data suggest that Loop Current intrusion/retreat is dominantly an annual process. Loop Current metrics such as maximum northern boundary latitude and area are relatively high from January through about July and low in September and October. February metrics are statistically different than metrics in either October or November or both. This annual process is primarily driven by and dynamically linked to geostrophic currents seaward of the Campeche Bank shelf break forced by Kelvin waves generated on the southeast United States and Gulf of Mexico continental shelves. The dominant mode of an altimetric coastal empirical orthogonal function analysis of the southeast United States and Gulf of Mexico continental shelves indicates that the primary coastal signal covaries with the Loop Current and accounts for 65...|$|R
