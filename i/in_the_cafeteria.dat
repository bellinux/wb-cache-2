5|$|André 3000 and Big Boi met in 1992 at the Lenox Square {{shopping}} mall {{when they were}} both 16 years old. The two lived in the East Point section of Atlanta and attended Tri-Cities High School. During school, they participated in rap battles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria.</b> André 3000 {{dropped out of high school}} at age 17 and worked a series of jobs before he and Big Boi formed a group called 2 Shades Deep; he returned to obtain his GED at a night school following the release of Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. They briefly dabbled in street-hustling to save up for recording money.|$|E

Their conversation is interrupted by a performance by the obnoxious Greendale glee club. Midway through, Chang (Ken Jeong) stops them with a cease and desist order from ASCAP—tipped off by Jeff (Joel McHale)—for performing copyrighted music without permission. The glee club members suffer a nervous breakdown and are taken to the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Winger, a disbarred lawyer, has {{enrolled}} at Greendale Community College {{as a condition}} for getting his license back. His plan is to use his friendship with Dr. Ian Duncan to obtain test answers. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria</b> Jeff meets the attractive Britta, and (in an attempt to get closer to her) convinces her to join his non-existent Spanish study group. As the study group convenes, Jeff pretends the other members simply did not show up. Britta, however, has invited Abed to join them. Jeff unsuccessfully tries to make him leave, and then gets called to the football field by Dr. Duncan. The professor makes a futile attempt to appeal to Jeff's conscience, and eventually agrees to provide the answers. Jeff returns to the study group, discovering that Abed has also invited Troy, Shirley, Pierce and Annie. Finding Britta smoking outside, he suggests the two study alone, but she persuades him to return.|$|E

5|$|Unable {{to focus}} on {{research}} problems, Feynman began tackling physics problems, not for utility, but for self-satisfaction. One of these involved analyzing the physics of a twirling, nutating disk as it is moving through the air, inspired by an incident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria</b> at Cornell when someone tossed a dinner plate in the air. He read the work of Sir William Rowan Hamilton on quaternions, and attempted unsuccessfully {{to use them to}} formulate a relativistic theory of electrons. His work during this period, which used equations of rotation to express various spinning speeds, ultimately proved important to his Nobel Prize–winning work, yet because he felt burned out and had turned his attention to less immediately practical problems, he was surprised by the offers of professorships from other renowned universities, including the Institute for Advanced Study, the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of California, Berkeley.|$|E
25|$|A Jefferson County Sheriff's Deputy, Neil Gardner, was {{assigned}} to the high school as a full-time uniformed and armed school resource officer. Gardner usually ate lunch with students <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria,</b> but on April 20 he was eating lunch in his patrol car at the northwest corner of the campus, watching students in the Smokers' Pit in Clement Park. The security staff at Columbine did not observe the bombs being placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria,</b> since a custodian was replacing the school security video tape as it happened. The bags holding the bombs were first visible on the fresh security tape, but they were not identified as suspicious items.

25|$|More complex bombs, {{such as the}} {{one that}} detonated on the corner of South Wadsworth Boulevard and Ken Caryl Avenue, had timers. The two largest bombs built were found in the school {{cafeteria}} and were made from small propane tanks. Only one of these bombs went off, only partially detonating. It was estimated that if any of the bombs placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria</b> had detonated properly, the blast could have caused extensive structural damage to the school and would have resulted in hundreds of casualties.|$|E
25|$|The Columbine High School {{massacre}} was {{a school}} shooting that occurred on April 20, 1999, at Columbine High School in Columbine, an unincorporated area of Jefferson County in the American state of Colorado. In addition to the shootings, the complex and highly planned attack involved a fire bomb to divert firefighters, propane tanks converted to bombs placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria,</b> 99 explosive devices, and car bombs. The perpetrators, senior students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, murdered 12 students and one teacher. They injured 21 additional people, and three more were injured while attempting to escape the school. The pair subsequently committed suicide.|$|E

50|$|Anri is Haruhi's {{close friend}} and also a fellow mage in training. She tends {{to have a very}} strong-willed type of {{personality}} which she uses {{to try to get the}} things she wants. It can also make her reckless when it comes to her using magic, due to her being overconfident and underskilled compared to Haruhi. She is left handed according to the seventh anime episode. Her magic wand is named Paella (Paeria) and was formed from her favorite feathered pen. She applied for a part-time job as a waitress <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Oasis <b>cafeteria</b> to save some money for her to be able to go abroad and study at a Magic Institution.

25|$|After {{the first}} two shootings, Harris removed his trench coat and aimed his 9mm carbine down the west {{staircase}} toward three youths: 15-year-olds Daniel Rohrbough and Sean Graves and 16-year-old Lance Kirklin. The three friends had been ascending the staircase directly below the shooters. Kirklin later reported seeing Klebold and Harris standing {{at the top of}} the staircase before the pair opened fire. All three youths were shot and wounded. Inside the school, some of the students had believed that they were bearing witness to a senior prank by the two seniors. But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria,</b> Dave Sanders, a computer and business teacher as well as a varsity coach, quickly realized it was not a prank but a deliberate attack on the school.|$|E
25|$|Their {{journals}} documented {{their plan}} for a major bombing to rival that of the Oklahoma City bombing. Their entries contained blurbs about ways to escape to Mexico, hijacking an aircraft at Denver International Airport and crashing it into a building in New York City (foreshadowing the September 11 attacks by two years), and details about the planned attack. The pair hoped that, after detonating their home-made explosives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria</b> at the busiest time of day, killing hundreds of students, they would shoot survivors fleeing from the school. Then, as police vehicles, ambulances, fire trucks, and reporters came to the school, bombs set in the boys' cars would detonate, killing these emergency and other personnel. That did not happen, since these explosives did not detonate.|$|E
25|$|After {{leaving the}} library, Harris and Klebold entered the science area, where they threw {{a small fire}} bomb into an empty storage closet. It caused a fire, which was put out by a teacher hidden in an {{adjacent}} room. The duo proceeded toward the south hallway, where they shot into an empty science room. At approximately 11:44a.m., Harris and Klebold were captured on the school security cameras as they re-entered the cafeteria. The recording shows Harris kneeling on the landing and firing a single shot {{toward one of the}} propane bombs he and Klebold had earlier left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria,</b> in an unsuccessful attempt to detonate it. He took a sip from one of the drinks left behind as Klebold approached the propane bomb and examined it. Klebold lit a Molotov cocktail and threw it at the propane bomb. As the two left the cafeteria, the Molotov cocktail exploded, partially detonating one of the propane bombs at 11:46a.m. Two minutes later, approximately one gallon of fuel ignited in the same vicinity, causing a fire that was extinguished by the fire sprinklers.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} whether the selection of products <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school <b>cafeterias</b> <b>in</b> Uppsala county high schools' comply with NFA's (National Food Administration) recommendations. Furthermore, the intention was to examine pupils´ eating habits {{before and during the}} school day, and their views on the school cafeteria´s selection of products. To investigate this, an inventory of school cafeterias in six high schools in Uppsala County, and a survey among 60 pupils were carried out. The results showed that the NFA's recommendations not always were followed. The survey showed that there were healthy products <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cafeterias</b> but unhealthy products nevertheless constituted {{a large part of the}} selection. Majority of the pupils reported that they used <b>the</b> school <b>cafeteria</b> on a weekly basis and that they mainly bought candy, cakes, sweetened drinks and sandwiches. Most pupils reported they ate breakfast more than 5 times per week, and that they ate lunch at school 3 - 5 times per week. Majority of students reported they never replaced the school lunch with products of the school cafeteria´s selection. Most of the pupils thought that the selection of <b>the</b> school <b>cafeterias</b> satisfied their needs. If the pupils would be able to change something <b>in</b> <b>the</b> selection of <b>the</b> school <b>cafeterias</b> <b>the</b> majority desired more healthy products. Good eating habits are established in childhood and adolescence and are important for the public health. Young people spend much of their daily lives at school. The school plays an important role in creating conditions for young people to choose good and healthy eating habits. This survey shows that the selection of <b>the</b> school <b>cafeterias</b> has importance to young people's choice of healthy eating...|$|R

25|$|Hoveyda's rise {{to power}} {{involved}} many years of service within the ministry of foreign affairs, but this path took {{on a whole new}} approach once he joined the Board of Directors of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) in 1958 at the behest of his patron Abdullah Entezam, who had by then assumed a high ranking position at the company. As managing director and special assistant to Entezam, Hoveyda used his experiences in the West to transform management-worker relations. As an example, he introduced innovative methods by which workers filed grievances in regard to any aspect of the working environment they deemed unsatisfactory, and helped to figuratively enmesh the roles of management and the labourers into a collective entity. One way he went about doing this was by eating many of his meals alongside wage labourers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria.</b> Although he advocated the emulation of Western models to improve overall productivity and worker relations, Hoveyda was very outspoken in favour of expelling foreign technicians and attracting indigenous sources of labour. It was during his tenure in which the NIOC's periodical, Kavosh (Exploration), was first published. What is unique about this magazine is that it was, initially, virtually void of any semblance of the growing cult of personality which surrounded the Shah.|$|E
