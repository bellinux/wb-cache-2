In {{this type of}} programming, the ability to cancel a running task arises as a critical feature.

This paper provides a classification of task cancellation patterns, as well as a detailed analysis of their advantages and disadvantages. One promising approach is cooperative cancellation, where threads must be continuously prepared for external <b>cancellation</b> <b>requests.</b> Based on this pattern, we propose an extension of SCOOP, an object-oriented concurrency model. ...|$|R

To prevent a freefall and risk going bankrupt, Shintom tried contacting Funai for several years if they could joint-merger but was denied each time, stating Funai is a family-owned, private corporation. By 1995, Sony stopped ordering Shintom's mechanism that was used for non-editing VHS VCRs, VCPs, and TV/VCR combos. Therefore, the VHS chassis mechanism business was dissolved.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes lenders {{will require}} that LMI {{be paid for}} a fixed period (for example, 2 or 3 years), even if the {{principal}} reaches 80% sooner than that. Legally, there is no obligation to allow the cancellation of MI until the loan has amortized to a 78% LTV ratio (based on the original purchase price). The <b>cancellation</b> <b>request</b> must come from the Servicer of the mortgage to the PMI company who issued the insurance. Often the Servicer will require a new appraisal to determine the LTV. The cost of mortgage insurance varies considerably based on several factors which include: loan amount, LTV, occupancy (primary, second home, investment property), documentation provided at loan origination, and most of all, credit score.|$|R

50|$|Vista modifies the {{behavior}} of asynchronous I/O operations. With the new asynchronous I/O APIs, a thread, {{different from the one}} that issued the I/O request, can be notified when the operation completes. With this, a single thread can issue all the I/O requests, and then switch to a different worker thread. If this thread is the one that handles the data after the I/O request completes, then a thread-switch, which causes a performance hit, may be avoided. Windows Vista also introduces synchronous I/O cancellation. During a synchronous I/O request, the application is blocked until the request is serviced or fails. In Windows Vista the application may issue a <b>cancellation</b> <b>request.</b> Applications that cancel the operation on user feedback may prefer to enable user feedback during the time the issuing thread is suspended for usability.|$|R
