Prismo explains that Jake can still save Finn by using <b>his</b> <b>wish,</b> but reveals that <b>his</b> <b>wish</b> must be very specific, as Prismo's wishes {{have a tendency to}} have a monkey's paw—an ironic twist—connected to them. After coaching by Prismo, Jake wishes that the Lich's original wish had been for Finn and Jake to return home. Prismo grants the wish, and Finn and Jake are indeed transported back to Ooo. Finn has no recollection of his time in the alternate reality, but Jake does.|$|E

5|$|After a {{few more}} adventures, Candide and Cacambo wander into El Dorado, a {{geographically}} isolated utopia where the streets are covered with precious stones, there exist no priests, {{and all of the}} king's jokes are funny. Candide and Cacambo stay a month in El Dorado, but Candide is still in pain without Cunégonde, and expresses to the king <b>his</b> <b>wish</b> to leave. The king points out that this is a foolish idea, but generously helps them do so. The pair continue their journey, now accompanied by one hundred red pack sheep carrying provisions and incredible sums of money, which they slowly lose or have stolen over the next few adventures.|$|E
5|$|Alone with Shuu, Ryouta finally remembers {{what he had}} {{forgotten}} due to the traumatic nature of the events: he recognizes the doctor {{as a man who}} promised to grant <b>his</b> <b>wish</b> for peace between birds and humans after he and the protagonist witnessed a human terrorist incident at a bird orphanage in which the protagonist's parents, crisis negotiators, were killed, and that the protagonist died when she visited him in the infirmary. It is revealed that she died by Charon virus after coming in contact with Ryouta, as Shuu had induced the virus into Ryouta's body though grafts from Nageki's remains for the purpose of using him to exterminate humanity—since there can be no more fighting between two factions if one is wiped out, this would grant Ryouta's wish. Shuu then remarks that Labor 9 was powered by the protagonist's now irreversibly damaged brain. A broken Ryouta submits to Shuu's offer of becoming a living weapon of mass destruction after these revelations, and a struggle ensues during which the protagonist's spirit intervenes. Ryouta then asks Shuu why he decided to grant <b>his</b> <b>wish,</b> to which it is implied that Shuu's affection towards Ryouta's deceased father, Ryuuji, was greater than Shuu himself would like to admit, and that he was motivated by Ryuuji's dying request: to do something for his son.|$|E

5|$|Arundel's {{body was}} {{initially}} interred at the Franciscan church in Hereford. It had been <b>his</b> <b>wish,</b> however, {{to be buried}} at the family's traditional resting place of Haughmond Abbey in Shropshire, {{and this is where}} he was finally buried. Though he was never canonised, a cult emerged around the late earl in the 1390s, associating him with the 9th-century martyr king St Edmund. This veneration may have been inspired by a similar cult around his grandson, Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel, who was executed by Richard II in 1397.|$|E
5|$|At a {{birthday}} reception in Windsor Castle, the King states <b>his</b> <b>wish</b> {{to be closer}} to Victoria and insults her mother.

The King then sends the Prime Minister Lord Melbourne to advise her. Victoria agrees to make him her private secretary, and he appoints ladies-in-waiting for her from political families allied to him.|$|E

Meanwhile, a paratiyar (Mahabharata-reciter) {{tells the story of}} the culmination of the war, symbolic of Aravan fulfilling <b>his</b> <b>wish</b> of seeing the war. Hiltebeitel suggests that while the Aravanis weep for Aravan's kalappali, the villagers weep for the death of an ancestor, as life leaves Aravan's head at the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|Brotherhood {{was made}} {{as part of}} a planned {{multimedia}} expansion of Final Fantasy XV without the need to develop a series of games. The series was conceived by Ofuji in 2014, based on <b>his</b> <b>wish</b> to expand upon an in-game reference to the difficult childhood of one of the characters. The story focuses on themes of brotherhood and friendship, and was designed to give players glimpses into the personal lives and personalities of the characters that would not have fitted within the game.|$|E
5|$|Brudenell {{was a fine}} rider and, {{inspired}} by the decisive role of cavalry {{at the battle of}} Waterloo, <b>his</b> <b>wish</b> was to purchase a commission in a fashionable regiment and serve as an army officer. His father, however, mindful of preserving the family pedigree from risk of battle, would not allow this. Instead in November 1815 he was sent up to Christ Church, Oxford; as an aristocrat he was automatically granted admission without examination. He left in his third year—aristocrats with no academic bent were released after only two years—but despite showing some aptitude, he did not take a degree.|$|E
50|$|Then, Geralt realises something. The genie was {{fulfilling}} <b>HIS</b> <b>wishes,</b> {{since he}} was the one holding the seal last. <b>His</b> first <b>wish</b> was the incantation he used on the genie and his second was the wish for the guard to burst, and thus the genie is still awaiting Geralt's third wish. Because the genie still has to fulfill <b>his</b> master's <b>wish,</b> he is not yet freed, and is thus not able to be captured by Yennefer. While rethinking <b>his</b> possible last <b>wish,</b> he also realizes what Yennefer looked like before she became a sorceress; she was a hunchback. Then, he decided upon <b>his</b> last <b>wish.</b>|$|R

5|$|By 1921, Tzara {{had become}} {{involved}} in conflicts with other figures in the movement, whom he claimed had parted {{with the spirit of}} Dada. He was targeted by the Berlin-based Dadaists, in particular by Huelsenbeck and Serner, the former of whom was also involved in a conflict with Raoul Hausmann over leadership status. According to Richter, tensions between Breton and Tzara had surfaced in 1920, when Breton first made known <b>his</b> <b>wish</b> to do away with musical performances altogether and alleged that the Romanian was merely repeating himself. The Dada shows themselves were by then such common occurrences that audiences expected to be insulted by the performers.|$|E
