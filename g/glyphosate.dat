5|$|Current park {{managers}} {{focus on}} controlling nine high-priority invasive plant species of noxious weeds: yellow star-thistle (Centaurea solstitialis); spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa); Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus); bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare); velvet grass (Holcus lanatus); cheat grass (Bromus tectorum); French broom (Genista monspessulana); Italian thistle (Carduus pycnocephalus); and perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium). In 2008, the park {{began to use}} the herbicides <b>glyphosate</b> and aminopyralid to augment manual methods to manage the most threatening plants.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{developed}} patents for {{genetically modified}} soybeans that were resistant to glyphosate-based herbicides. When farmers sprayed the modified soybeans with the <b>glyphosate</b> herbicide Roundup, the modified soybeans would survive while competing plants (weeds) would be killed. Monsanto sold these soybeans under a limited-use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer {{from using the}} seeds {{for more than a}} single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting.|$|E
5|$|The {{herbicide}} <b>glyphosate</b> is an inhibitor of 3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase, other herbicides, {{such as the}} sulfonylureas {{inhibit the}} enzyme acetolactate synthase. Both these enzymes are needed for plants to make branched-chain amino acids. Many other enzymes are inhibited by herbicides, including enzymes needed for the biosynthesis of lipids and carotenoids and the processes of photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are found}} in nature and are also {{designed}} and produced as part of pharmacology and biochemistry. Natural poisons are often enzyme inhibitors that have evolved to defend a plant or animal against predators. These natural toxins include {{some of the most}} poisonous compounds known. Artificial inhibitors are often used as drugs, but can also be insecticides such as malathion, herbicides such as <b>glyphosate,</b> or disinfectants such as triclosan. Other artificial enzyme inhibitors block acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which breaks down acetylcholine, and are used as nerve agents in chemical warfare.|$|E
5|$|Control of the plant, when desired, is best managed via {{mechanical}} means, such as hand pulling and hoeing, preferably {{followed by}} sowing of native plants. Animals rarely graze {{it because of}} its irritating hairs, and liquid herbicides require surfactants to be effective, as the hair causes water to roll off the plant, much like the lotus effect. Burning is ineffective, as it only creates new bare areas for seedlings to occupy. G. tetrum and Cucullia verbasci usually have little effect on V.thapsus populations as a whole. Goats and chickens have also been proposed to control mullein. Effective (when used with a surfactant) contact herbicides include <b>glyphosate,</b> triclopyr and sulfurometuron-methyl. Ground herbicides, like tebuthiuron, are also effective, but recreate bare ground and require repeated application to prevent regrowth.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman bought soybean crop {{seeds from}} a local grain {{elevator}} for his second crop of the season. He then saved seeds from his second crop to replant additional crops in later years. Bowman purchased these soybean seeds from the same elevator to which he and neighbors sold their soybean crops, {{many of which were}} transgenic, and the elevator sold these soybeans as commodities, not as seeds for planting. He tested the new seeds, and found that, as he had expected, some were transgenic and thus were resistant to <b>glyphosate.</b> He replanted seeds from the original second harvest in subsequent years for his second seasonal planting, supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at the elevator. He informed Monsanto of his activities.|$|E
25|$|X-ray crystallographic {{studies of}} <b>glyphosate</b> and EPSPS show that <b>glyphosate</b> {{functions}} by occupying the binding {{site of the}} phosphoenolpyruvate, mimicking an intermediate state of the ternary enzymeâ€“substrate complex. <b>Glyphosate</b> inhibits the EPSPS enzymes of different species of plants and microbes at different rates.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 Monsanto {{patented}} {{the use of}} <b>glyphosate</b> as an antiparasitic, and in 2017 they marketed a Roundup formulation without <b>glyphosate,</b> as a lawn herbicide.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{meta-analysis}} {{reviewed the}} available data related to potential impacts of glyphosate-based herbicides on amphibians. According to the authors, the use of glyphosate-based pesticides cannot be considered the major cause of amphibian decline, the bulk of which occurred prior to {{the widespread use of}} <b>glyphosate</b> or in pristine tropical areas with minimal <b>glyphosate</b> exposure. The authors recommended further study of species- and development-stage chronic toxicity, of environmental <b>glyphosate</b> levels, and ongoing analysis of data relevant to determining what if any role <b>glyphosate</b> might be playing in worldwide amphibian decline, and suggest including amphibians in standardized test batteries.|$|E
25|$|According to the National Pesticide Information Center fact sheet, <b>glyphosate</b> is not {{included}} in compounds tested for by the Food and Drug Administration's Pesticide Residue Monitoring Program, nor in the United States Department of Agriculture's Pesticide Data Program. However, a field test showed that lettuce, carrots, and barley contained <b>glyphosate</b> residues up to one year after the soil was treated with 3.71lb of <b>glyphosate</b> per acre (4.15kg per hectare). The U.S. has determined the acceptable daily intake of <b>glyphosate</b> at 1.75 milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight per day (mg/kg/bw/day) while the European Union has set it at 0.3.|$|E
25|$|Constant {{exposure}} to a toxin creates evolutionary pressure for pests resistant to that toxin. Overreliance on <b>glyphosate</b> {{and a reduction in}} the diversity of weed management practices allowed the spread of <b>glyphosate</b> resistance in 14 weed species/biotypes in the US.|$|E
25|$|The {{abundance}} {{of the plant}} can be significantly reduced by applying <b>glyphosate,</b> imazapyr, a combination of both, or by cutting all visible stalks and filling the stems with <b>glyphosate.</b> However, these methods have not been proven to provide reliable long-term results in completely eliminating the treated population.|$|E
25|$|In June 2015, the French Ecology Minister asked {{nurseries}} {{and garden}} centers to halt over-the-counter sales of <b>glyphosate</b> {{in the form}} of Monsanto's Roundup. This was a nonbinding request and all sales of <b>glyphosate</b> remain legal in France until 2022, when the substance will be banned for home gardening.|$|E
25|$|Many of the maize {{varieties}} {{grown in}} the United States and Canada are hybrids. Often the varieties have been genetically modified to tolerate <b>glyphosate</b> or to provide protection against natural pests. <b>Glyphosate</b> is an herbicide which kills all plants except those with genetic tolerance. This genetic tolerance is very rarely found in nature.|$|E
25|$|The main {{deactivation}} {{path for}} <b>glyphosate</b> is hydrolysis to aminomethylphosphonic acid.|$|E
25|$|In May 2015, the {{president}} of Sri Lanka banned the use and import of <b>glyphosate,</b> effective immediately.|$|E
25|$|Glyphosate-resistant {{ryegrass}} (Lolium) {{has occurred}} {{in most of the}} Australian agricultural areas and other areas of the world. All cases of evolution of resistance to <b>glyphosate</b> in Australia were characterized by intensive use of the herbicide while no other effective weed control practices were used. Studies indicate the resistant ryegrass does not compete well against nonresistant plants and their numbers decrease when not grown under conditions of <b>glyphosate</b> application.|$|E
25|$|Use of <b>glyphosate</b> {{to clear}} {{milkweed}} along roads and fields {{may have contributed}} to a decline in monarch butterfly populations in the Midwestern United States. Along with deforestation and adverse weather conditions, the decrease in milkweed contributed to an 81% decline in monarchs. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) filed a suit in 2015 against the EPA, in which it is argued that the agency ignored warnings about the dangers of <b>glyphosate</b> usage for monarchs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glyphosate</b> {{was first}} {{approved}} {{for use in}} the 1970s, and as of 2010 was labelled for use in 130 countries.|$|E
25|$|Roundup Ready alfalfa, {{a genetically}} {{modified}} variety, {{was released by}} Forage Genetics International in 2005. This was developed through the insertion of a gene owned by Monsanto Company that confers resistance to <b>glyphosate,</b> a broad-spectrum herbicide, also known as Roundup. Although most grassy and broadleaf plants, including ordinary alfalfa, are killed by Roundup; growers can spray fields of Roundup Ready alfalfa with the <b>glyphosate</b> herbicide and kill the weeds without harming the alfalfa crop.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glyphosate</b> kills {{plants by}} {{interfering with the}} {{synthesis}} of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan in the shikimate pathway. It does this by inhibiting the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), which catalyzes the reaction of shikimate-3-phosphate (S3P) and phosphoenolpyruvate to form 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP). <b>Glyphosate</b> is absorbed through foliage and minimally through roots, meaning {{that it is only}} effective on actively growing plants and cannot prevent seeds from germinating. After application, <b>glyphosate</b> is readily transported around the plant to growing roots and leaves and this systemic activity is important for its effectiveness. Inhibiting the enzyme causes shikimate to accumulate in plant tissues and diverts energy and resources away from other processes. While growth stops within hours of application, it takes several days for the leaves to begin turning yellow.|$|E
25|$|In April 2014, the {{legislature}} of the Netherlands passed legislation prohibiting sale of <b>glyphosate</b> to individuals for use at home; commercial sales were not affected.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to resistant weeds, farmers are hand-weeding, using tractors {{to turn over}} soil between crops, and using other herbicides in addition to <b>glyphosate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Monsanto {{scientists}} have found that some resistant weeds {{have as many as}} 160 extra copies of a gene called EPSPS, the enzyme <b>glyphosate</b> disrupts.|$|E
25|$|In September 2013, the {{legislative}} assembly of El Salvador approved legislation to ban 53 agrochemicals, including glyphosate; {{the ban on}} <b>glyphosate</b> was set to begin in 2015.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glyphosate</b> {{can control}} the growth of apicomplexan parasites, such as Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium falciparum (malaria), and Cryptosporidium parvum, and has been {{considered}} an antimicrobial agent in mammals.|$|E
25|$|United States {{companies}} have cited trade issues with <b>glyphosate</b> being {{dumped into the}} western world market areas by Chinese companies and a formal dispute was filed in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Physical and {{chemical}} control methods have generally {{proved to be}} ineffective and uneconomic in Hawaii, although <b>glyphosate</b> has been successfully used to control P. tarminiana in Acacia koa forest.|$|E
25|$|Farmers quickly adopted <b>glyphosate,</b> {{especially}} after Monsanto introduced glyphosate-resistant Roundup Ready crops, enabling farmers to kill weeds without killing their crops. In 2007, <b>glyphosate</b> {{was the most}} used herbicide in the United States' agricultural sector and the second-most used in home and garden (2,4-D being the most used), government and industry, and commerce. By 2016 there was a 100-fold increase from the late 1970s {{in the frequency of}} applications and volumes of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) applied, with further increases expected in the future, partly in response to the global emergence and spread of glyphosate-resistant weeds.|$|E
25|$|Controversies have erupted {{multiple}} {{times when the}} IARC has classified many things as Class 2a (probable carcinogens), including cell phone signals, <b>glyphosate,</b> drinking hot beverages, and working as a barber.|$|E
25|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} <b>glyphosate</b> {{has been described}} in the microbiology literature since its discovery in 1970 and the description of glyphosate's mechanism of action in 1972. Efficacy was described for numerous bacteria and fungi.|$|E
25|$|There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} human cancer risk might increase {{as a result}} of exposure to large amounts of <b>glyphosate,</b> but no good evidence of such a risk from typical usage, such as in domestic gardening.|$|E
25|$|Australia also {{produces}} considerable amounts of cotton. The {{majority of the}} cotton produced is genetically modified to be resistant to the herbicide <b>glyphosate</b> or to actively kill pests through the production of Bt toxin (Bt-cotton). Cotton is generally grown by irrigation.|$|E
25|$|Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene {{implanted}} {{into its}} genome {{that allows the}} plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosates. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With {{the increasing use of}} herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas <b>glyphosate</b> resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread <b>glyphosate</b> usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.|$|E
25|$|On April 4, 2016, Dr. Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, {{wrote an}} open letter to the Chair of the Board of the <b>Glyphosate</b> Task at Monsanto Europe asking to publish the full studies {{provided}} to the EFSA.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its use as an herbicide, <b>glyphosate</b> is also used for crop desiccation (siccation) to increase harvest yield, {{and as a result}} of desiccation, to increase sucrose concentration in sugarcane before harvest. The application of <b>glyphosate</b> just before harvest on grains (like wheat, barley, and oats) kills the food crop so that it dries more quickly and evenly, similar to the use of dessicants. This dry crop does not have to be windrowed (swathed and dried) prior to harvest but can easily be straight cut and harvested. This saves the farmer time and money,which is important in northern regions where the growing season is short. Excess residue levels in beans resulting from incorrect application can render the crop unfit for sale.|$|E
