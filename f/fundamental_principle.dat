5|$|The {{primacy of}} {{imagination}} and intuition over the subjective character of creation was a <b>fundamental</b> <b>principle</b> of El Greco's style. El Greco discarded classicist criteria such as measure and proportion. He believed that grace is the supreme quest of art, but the painter achieves grace {{only if he}} manages to solve the most complex problems with obvious ease.|$|E
5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a <b>fundamental</b> <b>principle.</b> People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

40|$|Because its {{underlying}} <b>principles</b> are so <b>fundamental,</b> holography {{has been studied}} and applied {{in many areas of}} science. Recently, a technique has been developed which takes the maximum advantage of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>principles</b> and extracts much more information from a hologram than is customarily associated with such a measurement. In this paper the <b>fundamental</b> <b>principles</b> of holography are reviewed, and a sound radiation measurement system, called nearfield acoustic holography (NAH), which fully exploits the <b>fundamental</b> <b>principles,</b> is described...|$|R

25|$|During {{his four}} decades as Rebbe, Schneerson would deliver weekly addresses, {{centered}} on the weekly Torah portion and on various tractates of the Talmud.

25|$|Modern-day Spaniards - {{the people}} of Spain - {{recognize}} the independence of Spanish women. Throughout the late 20th century, Spain has undergone a transition from the authoritarian conservative dictatorship in Francoist Spain (1939-1975), during which women's rights were severely restricted, to a democratic society where gender equality is a <b>fundamental</b> <b>principle.</b> As such, during the past decades the position of women in Spanish society has greatly improved.|$|E

For this reason, Hooke's law is extensively used in all branches of science and engineering, and is the foundation of many disciplines such as seismology, molecular mechanics and acoustics. It is also the <b>fundamental</b> <b>principle</b> behind the spring scale, the manometer, and the balance wheel of the mechanical clock.|$|E

25|$|It {{has also}} been argued that the {{evolution}} of order in living systems and certain physical systems obeys a common <b>fundamental</b> <b>principle</b> termed the Darwinian dynamic. The Darwinian dynamic was formulated by first considering how macroscopic order is generated in a simple non-biological system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, and then extending consideration to short, replicating RNA molecules. The underlying order-generating process was concluded to be basically similar for both types of systems.|$|E
25|$|The <b>fundamental</b> <b>principle</b> {{of modern}} roundabouts is that {{entering}} drivers {{give way to}} traffic within the roundabout {{without the use of}} traffic signals. Traffic circles typically require circling drivers to give way to entering traffic. Generally, exiting directly from the inner lane of a multi-lane roundabout is permitted, given that the intersecting road has as many lanes as the roundabout. By contrast, exiting from the inner lane of a traffic circle is usually not permitted without first merging to the circle's outside lane.|$|E

Root promptly signed over his prize check to the fledgling magazine Foreign Affairs, which was itself attempting to build an endowment fund to insure its longterm survival.|$|E

Foster's objection was muted when Browder emphasized that open criticism would have been regarded as a punishable breach of party discipline. Darcy refused to submit to party discipline on this matter, however, viewing it as a matter of <b>fundamental</b> <b>principle.</b> He was subsequently expelled from the CPA by a committee headed by Foster himself.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the {{photoelectric}} effect {{is associated with}} Albert Einstein, who relied upon the phenomenon to establish the <b>fundamental</b> <b>principle</b> of quantum mechanics in 1905, an accomplishment for which Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize. It is worthwhile to note that Heinrich Hertz, working 18 years earlier, had not recognized that the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons {{is proportional to the}} frequency but independent of the optical intensity. This fact implied a discrete nature of light, i.e. the existence of quanta, for the first time.|$|E

In response to Western complaints {{of human rights abuses}} in Iran he has stated that the American administration has committed many crimes and is therefore not fit to judge the Islamic Republic.|$|E
