40|$|Background: Globalisation is {{changing}} the world and our daily lives are governed by products and images originating from other countries and other cultures. Globalisation influences consumer culture and different authors have argued {{for the emergence of}} global consumer culture. However, previous literature de-emphasizes what consumer beliefs about the global consumer culture are and how people who believe that they are global try to construct themselves as global in terms of consumption. What are their motives of being global and what kind of needs and wants do they cover by being global consumers? Purpose: To explore and illustrate how consumers try to construct their <b>global</b> <b>selves</b> through consumption. Method: An abductive, qualitative research approach with a combination of exploratory and descriptive research design was chosen. Primary data collection through semi-structured in-depth interviews was conducted among 15 respondents who tried to construct their <b>global</b> <b>selves</b> through consumption. These consumers were selected through a non-probability sampling and interviews took place in Jönköping, Sweden. Conclusion: Consumers try to construct their <b>global</b> <b>selves</b> in a variety of ways, the most common ones are through travelling and engaging in cultural experiences, consuming products from specific countries for certain reasons, and by observing the market as one whole global market, thus not limiting themselves into the boundaries of specific countries, regions or continents. This consumption is then grounded on myths and beliefs that they have accumulated about global consumer culture while gaining experience {{in different parts of the}} world. These myths and beliefs are however based on their perceptions towards global consumer culture, not objective reality per se...|$|R

40|$|First paragraph: Two of {{the major}} themes {{to come out of}} the works {{published}} in 2014 in the field of Romantic general and prose writing are those of local, national, and global identities, and questions of selfhood. Sarah Houghton-Walker’s Representations of the Gypsy in the Romantic Period looks at the representation of the gypsy figure in the Romantic period in relation to English identities, among other themes. David Higgins’s Romantic Englishness: Local, National and <b>Global</b> <b>Selves,</b> 1780 – 1850 examines local English identities in relation to broader conceptions of the self in an increasingly connected national or global context. Two texts also make use of the growing field of Atlantic studies to take a fresh look at travel writing, in the case of Elizabeth A.

5000|$|Media {{convergence}} in {{the digital}} era means {{the changes that are}} taking place with older forms of media and media companies. Media convergence has two roles, the first is the technological merging of different media channels - for example, magazines, radio programs, TV shows, and movies, now are available on the Internet through laptops, iPads, and smartphones. As discussed in Media Culture (by Campbell), convergence of technology is not new. It has been going on since the late 1920s. An example is RCA, the Radio Corporation of America, which purchased Victor Talking Machine Company and introduced machines that could receive radio and play recorded music. Next came the TV, and radio lost some of its appeal as people started watching television, which has both talking and music as well as visuals. As technology advances, convergence of media change to keep up. The second definition of media convergence Campbell discusses is cross-platform by media companies. This usually involves consolidating various media holdings, such as cable, phone, television (over the air, satellite, cable) and Internet access under one corporate umbrella. This is not for the consumer to have more media choices, this is {{for the benefit of the}} company to cut down on costs and maximize its profits. [...] As stated in the article, Convergence Culture and Media Work, by Mark Deuze, “the convergence of production and consumption of media across companies, channels, genres, and technologies is an expression of the convergence of all aspects of everyday life: work and play, the local and the <b>global,</b> <b>self</b> and social identity." ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Several studies {{could prove}} that {{subjective}} health was an independent predictor for individual mortality. The question for global health using a visual analogue scale {{was able to}} display well self rated health. Self rated health varied internationally and gender differences could be shown. The influence on subjective health {{of women and men}} caused by different factors of the domains lifestyle, social demographics, physical and psychic health was discussed controversially. The relative strength of different factors was only partly examined. Aims: The aim {{of this study was to}} show <b>global</b> <b>self</b> rated health of female and male patients in an Anesthesia Preoperative Evaluation Clinic (APEC). Furthermore, it was tried to identify relevant influencing factors of the domains lifestyle, social demographics, physical and psychic health and their relative strength was tried to be determined. Methods: From February 13 th to December 20 th 2006 3. 219 patients from the Anesthesia Preoperative Evaluation Clinic of the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin (Campus Mitte and Virchow-Klinikum) answered a questionnaire that was carried out within the context of a lifestyle survey. To measure <b>global</b> <b>self</b> rated health patients used a visual analogue scale to mark their global health. The visual analogue scale is part of the Euro-Qol questionnaire that was established to record subjective health and that is composed of 5 questions and the visual analogue scale. In addition, questions for the domains lifestyle, social demographics, physical and psychic health were asked. Statistics: For statistical calculations the computer program “The Statistical Package for Social Sciences“ (SPSS 17. 0) was used. Data was described. Differences in means of various participants’ <b>global</b> <b>self</b> rated health were calculated. Furthermore, linear regression analysis was executed in several steps to determine the influence of factors and 4 domains. Finally the influence of all factors together on <b>global</b> <b>self</b> rated health was calculated. Influence of 4 confounders (age, sex, high-school diploma and number of primary diseases) was taken into account. Results: The mean value of <b>global</b> <b>self</b> rated health of respondent patients was 67, 99 on the visual analogue scale. Men (68, 99) estimated their health as to be better then women (66, 96). The influence of factors of the domains lifestyle (1, 3 %) and social demographics (2, 6 %) was lower then the one of the domains psychic health (9, 0 %) and physical health (25, 1 %). All domains together explained 31, 3 % (women 32, 7 %, men 31, 1 %) of the patients’ <b>global</b> <b>self</b> rated health. Discussion: The <b>global</b> <b>self</b> rated health of patients from a Anesthesia Preoperative Evaluation Clinic was worse than <b>global</b> <b>self</b> rated health of a German general population (67, 99 versus 77, 4). In contrast to prior studies gender differences could be proved. Before this thesis was presented it was only possible to compare patients’ <b>global</b> <b>self</b> rated health with the one of healthy people or the one of patients with a certain disease. The presented data allows comparing patients <b>global</b> <b>self</b> rated health with the one of a group of patients in which different diseases occur. The in this way extended possibilities of comparison enables to more precisely evaluate patients’ health and to identify problem areas within patient groups. Relevant factors influencing <b>global</b> <b>self</b> rated health were identified. They were put in relation to each other. The influence of the domains lifestyle and social demographics was lower than the one of the domains physical and psychic health. In many cases factors influenced the <b>global</b> <b>self</b> rated health of women and men in a different manner. This kind of gender differences should be considered when future prevention measures such as education about risky lifestyle behaviour are planned. Knowing about relevant factors influencing <b>global</b> <b>self</b> rated health can highlight starting points for prevention and health education. Moreover, comparing different factors in terms of their relative strength influencing <b>global</b> <b>self</b> rated health supports a more aimed action in healthcare policy...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} relationships between literacy level and <b>global</b> <b>self</b> concept employment status income level, {{age and gender}} among students enrolled at a vocational technical college. The contribution of a subset of job-related reading self concepts to the multiple correlation was also examined. Method The study sample consisted of 100 students in Related Education Courses at Indiana Vocational Technical College, Region VI, Muncie, Indiana. Subjects responded to three instruments and a demographic questionnaire. The Literacy Assessment Battery (Sticht. 1982) provided literacy levels, the Tennessee Self Concept Scale (Fitts. 1964) yielded <b>global</b> <b>self</b> concept, and the Hays Job-Related Reading Survey (Hays, 1986) indicated job-related reading self concepts. Piloting of Hays Job-Related Reading Survey Reliability and construct validity were sought using responses from a sample (N = 230) closely comparable to one selected for the study. An analysis revealed four interpretable factors: (a) Positive Employee Self, (b) Perceived Limitations of Self, (c) Perceived Importance of Occupational Literacy, and (d) Perceived Value of Company Notices. Further analysis yielded coefficient alpha reliabilities of r =. 69 to r =. 86. Results Significant relationships were found between literacy level and the following: (a) <b>Global</b> <b>Self</b> Concept (r =. 20, p<. 04 :; (b) <b>Global</b> <b>Self</b> Concept when combined with Perceived Limitations of Self, a factor from the Hays Job Related Reading Survey (r =. 56. p<. 000 +); and (c) Perceived Limitations of Self alone (r =. 56, P<. 000 +). Conclusions Both <b>Global</b> <b>Self</b> Concept and Perceived Limitations of Self {{were significantly related to}} Literacy, both singly and in combination.

40|$|This paper takes a {{step towards}} formalizing the {{theoretical}} interconnections among four post-Industrial Revolution phenomena – the industrialization and growth take-off of rich 'northern' nations, massive global income divergence, and rapid trade expansion. Specifically, we present a stages-of-growth model in which the four phenomena are jointly endogenous and all are triggered by a gradual fall {{in the cost of}} trading goods internationally. In the first stage, while trade costs are high, industry is dispersed and growth is low. In the second stage, the north industrializes rapidly, growth takes off and the south diverges. In the third stage, high growth and <b>global</b> divergence become <b>self</b> sustaining. We then show that, in a fourth stage, when transaction costs on “trading” ideas have sufficiently decreased, the south can quickly industrialize and converge...|$|R
40|$|A major {{challenge}} in single particle reconstruction from cryo-electron microscopy {{is to establish}} a reliable ab-initio three-dimensional model using two-dimensional projection images with unknown orientations. Common-lines based methods estimate the orientations without additional geometric information. However, such methods fail when the detection rate of common-lines is too low due to the high level of noise in the images. An approximation to the least squares <b>global</b> <b>self</b> consistency error was obtained using convex relaxation by semidefinite programming. In this paper we introduce a more robust <b>global</b> <b>self</b> consistency error and show that the corresponding optimization problem can be solved via semidefinite relaxation. In order to prevent artificial clustering of the estimated viewing directions, we further introduce a spectral norm term that is added as a constraint or as a regularization term to the relaxed minimization problem. The resulted problems are solved by using either the alternating direction method of multipliers or an iteratively reweighted least squares procedure. Numerical experiments with both simulated and real images demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly reduce the orientation estimation error when the detection rate of common-lines is low...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} program were to provide evidence {{of the distinction between}} global and specific relational models and to assess their relative contributions in the experience of significant life events and daily social interactions. Relationship-specific models were operationalized in two ways: in terms of significant role relationships and in terms of salience (i. e., frequency of interactions). The association between global relational models and specific models, {{selected on the basis of}} the other's role (Study 1) or salience (Study 2), was examined. Results indicate that these constructs were correlated, but not redundant. Moderate stabitily of global and specific models was found over 4 months. Analyses examining the extent to which change in this network of models operated through top-down or bottom-up processes suggested that change occurred mainly as a bottom-up process. Models of self and other for established relationships were generalized to the global models, but the global models did not contribute much to shaping changes in specific models. Adjustment to two different life events was examined to distinguish between the contributions of global and distinct relationship-specific models in the experience of events eliciting different relational needs. Adjustment to university, anticipated to induce secure base needs, was in part explained by the <b>global</b> model of <b>self</b> and also by the model of other for father. In contrast, adjustment to a romantic breakup, expected to arouse safe haven needs, was associated with the model of self with a close friend, but not parental or global models. Finally, global and specific models of self and other contributed to explaining the experience of daily interactions within relationships. Relationship-specific models of other were most strongly associated with the quality and intimacy of interactions. The global model of other made modest, but significant additional contributions to explain these ratings. The <b>global</b> model of <b>self</b> moderated the association between specific models of self and ratings of interactions to explain a significant, yet small proportion of the variance. In sum, this research demonstrated that attachment or relational models can be considered both global and specific representational structures, reflecting relational as well as individual differences...|$|R

Two questionnaires were designed to explore aspects of the South African children's immigration experience, including reasons for their immigration, how they feel about it, what they like and do not like about South Africa, and what they like and do not like about New Zealand. One of these questionnaires was completed by the South African children's parents and the other by the South African children. The sample consisted of 36 South African children who had volunteered from three North Shore Intermediate schools. The control group consisted of 36 New Zealand children who had volunteered from a North Shore Intermediate school. All of the children completed the anxiety, self-esteem scales and the semantic differentials. Only the South African children and their parents completed the questionnaires. Results indicated no significant difference in State and Trait anxiety and <b>global</b> <b>self</b> worth for South African children and New Zealand children based on gender. A significant difference was found in social acceptance for the New Zealand children based on gender. New Zealand girls have significantly higher self-esteem (social acceptance) than do New Zealand boys.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{examine the}} extent to which older people's self {{assessments}} of general health, physical health, and mental health predict functional decline and mortality.  DESIGN—The study uses population-based secondary data from the US Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA).  PARTICIPANTS—A total of 7527  persons aged 70  years or above living in the community.  METHODS—Eight different measures on self reported general, physical, and mental health were used. Change in functional status was measured using a composite index of ADLs and IADLs over a period of six years. Duration of survival was calculated over a period of seven years. Adjusting for age and gender, multiple logistic regression was used in analysing functional decline, and Cox proportional hazard model, for mortality. Then all of the self assessed health measures were incorporated into the final model—controlling for baseline sociodemographic characteristics, functional status, disease/conditions, and use of health and social services—to assess the independent contribution of each measure in predicting future health outcomes.  MAIN RESULTS—Overall, older people's self assessed general, physical, and mental health were predictive of functional decline and mortality. In multivariate analyses, older people who assessed their <b>global</b> health, <b>self</b> care ability, and physical activity less favourably were more likely to experience poor health outcomes. Gender disparity, however, was observed with poor global health affecting functional decline in men only. Self care ability was predictive of functioning in women only, whereas it was predictive of mortality in men only.  CONCLUSIONS—Self assessed global health, as well as, specific dimensions of health act as significant, independent predictors of functioning and mortality in a community dwelling older people.    Keywords: age; self assessed health; functional status; mortalit...|$|R

There was no association between paranoia and external cognitive style (OR 1. 10 95 % CI 0. 83, 1. 47). Paranoid ideation in a community sample is associated with a global rather than an external cognitive style. An external cognitive style may be a characteristic of more severe paranoid beliefs. Further work is required to determine the role of depression in the association between cognitive style and paranoia...|$|R
40|$|Social <b>Self,</b> <b>Global</b> Culture: An Introduction to Sociological Ideas {{offers an}} {{exciting}} {{new approach to}} introductory sociology. It is the first text of its kind {{to encourage students to}} examine themselves as individuals before embarking on the study of community, nation, and the global processes that have influenced Australian society. Students begin with familiar issues and experiences, and then move progressively towards more abstract questions and ideas. They are encouraged to look at their personal experiences in the light of contemporary sociological analyses. This revised edition has been updated by all contributors. It opens with a new introduction that addresses the question of globalisation and the future of sociology in the context of Australia and the nation-state, asking where have we come from, who are we, and where are we headed. The authors critically and reflectively discuss a broad range of topics: the ethnic and gendered self, religion, work, government, health, welfare, social movements, development, and world revolutions—some of the most exciting and unnerving issues to confront contemporary sociologists and, indeed, all Australians.

40|$|This study {{concern on}} flow {{experience}} of people, {{who are interested}} in sports and web using. Design of the study is quantitative, questionnaire method with 516 respondents. These questionnairies were published on internet web sites. Comparison of these two groups were made on 9 dimensions of flow experience according to the components flow theory by Jackson, Csikszentmihalyi, 1999. We have used FSS - 2 method (flow state scale). We have also concerned on <b>global</b> <b>self</b> esteem. We have measured this by self valueing scale - Rosenberg. We have also verified which flow experience model fits better (channel model or classic model of flow). In results, we have found strong correlation of relationships between global self-esteem and flow experience among the groups. We have also noticed more intensive flow experience in the group of sportsmen...|$|E
40|$|The term {{resilience}} {{has been}} variously {{used to describe}} the capacity for successful adaptation to a changing environment and the character of hardiness and invulnerability (Ramanaiah, Sharpe, & Byravan, 1999). More recently, resilience has been conceptualized as a dynamic process involving an interaction between both risk and protective processes, internal and external to the individual (Rutter, 1999). This study takes as its starting point the studies have investigated the relation between personal resources and resilience (e. i. : Self efficacy : Allen (1998), Self esteem: Blum (1998). It intends to analyze the relation between some aspects of self-perception and resilience during adolescence. The main aim is to explore which specific self-perception domains are connected to resilience in different age levels. Our hypothesis is the <b>global</b> <b>self</b> worth is a predictor of resilience during adolescence...|$|E
40|$|The {{construct}} of Self-esteem has been explicated within the indigenous social context through development and validation of Self-esteem Scale. Firstly, the dimensionality of the Self-esteem construct and internal consistency/reliability {{of the self}} esteem scale were ascertained For that, an item pool was developed from qualitative data obtained from two pilot studies and the translations of four existing Self-esteem Scales. After an extensive scrutiny and evaluation of the items, 72 items, most relevant to the construct. and expressing evaluations of a <b>global</b> <b>self</b> and its various aspects, were phrased in self-reported statements with a five-point scale. This scale was given {{to a sample of}} 300 participants (150 boys and J 50 girls). The Principal Component Factor Analysis revealed that most of the items of Self-esteem Scale were positively loaded all first four factors that explained 22. 5...|$|E
40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{mechanisms}} by which psychosocial factors affect health, this re search investigated social integration and indicators of coping style and their relation to health behaviors and health status. The analysis was conducted using {{the results of a}} 1977 survey of 854 household interviews from a multi-stage probability sample of adult residents of Washtenaw County, Michigan. Physical-health status was evaluated by two indices: Self-rated <b>global</b> health and <b>self</b> reports of chronic disability. Mental health was assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Over all, the effects of the psychosocial factors were stronger for mental health than physi cal health. Social integration was shown to have direct effects on both physical and mental-health status. Internal locus of control was associated with lower levels of de pressive symptoms. Chronic conditions were primarily affected by age, sex, and health behavior. Evidence from the path analyses suggested that part of the health benefit that women accrue from social integration and an active coping style is related to better health behavior. This mediation effect was not found for men...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{concerns the}} musical production of relational identity narratives among {{people of the}} Jola ethnic group in the West African countries of Senegal and The Gambia. I argue that Jola music-makers deliberately create "audiotopic" spaces in which seemingly contradictory referents can be brought together and negotiated: {{the past and the}} present, the local and the <b>global,</b> the <b>Self</b> and the Other. In this way, Jola music is a social practice and self-reflexive discourse through which Jolas position themselves in relation to neighboring ethnic groups and an ongoing war of national secession, as well as broader narratives of the Black Atlantic and global citizenship. Despite their location in ostensibly isolated rural villages, Jolas experience themselves through the ethos of Afropolitanism, in which rootedness in a particular identity is also the means of transcending it. Whereas existing research too often characterizes African identities either as ancient and immutable or as politically contingent articulations of difference, my research instead emphasizes that Jolas make musical gestures of both difference and association, and that their ethnic identity is maintained through both strategic political positioning and a substantive system of longstanding cultural meanings and practices. Jola music is deeply participatory, inherently social, and associated with positive valences of tradition and heritage, qualities that allow the potentially contradictory array of local and global influences at play in Jola music culture to be molded into coherent self-conceptions. I explore these ideas through chapters focusing on a Jola stringed instrument called ekonting, a women's festival called alamaan, and the presence of Jola sounds in syncretic popular music in Senegal and beyond. This project is based on twelve months of ethnographic fieldwork conducted over a span of six years in Senegal, The Gambia, and the United States, comprising participant observation, audio and video recordings, and interviews conducted in English, French, Wolof, and Jola...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Physical {{activity}} {{has been consistently}} associated with enhanced quality of life (QOL) in older adults. However, {{the nature of this}} relationship is not fully understood. In this study of community dwelling older adults, we examined the proposition that physical activity influences global QOL through self-efficacy and health-status. Methods Participants (N = 321, M age = 63. 8) completed measures of physical activity, self-efficacy, <b>global</b> QOL, physical <b>self</b> worth, and disability limitations. Data were analyzed using covariance modeling to test the fit of the hypothesized model. Results Analyses indicated direct effects of a latent physical activity variable on self-efficacy but not disability limitations or physical self-worth; direct effects of self-efficacy on disability limitations and physical self worth but not QOL; and direct effects of disability limitations and physical self-worth on QOL. Conclusion Our findings support the role of self-efficacy in the relationship between physical activity and QOL as well as an expanded QOL model including both health status indicators and global QOL. These findings further suggest future PA promotion programs should include strategies to enhance self-efficacy, a modifiable factor for improving QOL in this population. </p...|$|R
