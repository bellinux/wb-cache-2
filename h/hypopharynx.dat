5|$|The {{salivary glands}} (element 30 in {{numbered}} diagram) in an insect's mouth produce saliva. The salivary ducts {{lead from the}} glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium, located behind the <b>hypopharynx.</b> By moving its mouthparts (element 32 in numbered diagram) the insect can mix its food with saliva. The mixture of saliva and food then travels through the salivary tubes into the mouth, where it begins to break down. Some insects, like flies, have extra-oral digestion. Insects using extra-oral digestion expel digestive enzymes onto their food to break it down. This strategy allows insects to extract {{a significant proportion of}} the available nutrients from the food source. The gut is where almost all of insects' digestion takes place. It can be divided into the foregut, midgut and hindgut.|$|E

25|$|The <b>hypopharynx</b> {{includes}} the pyriform sinuses, the posterior pharyngeal wall, and the postcricoid area. Tumors of the <b>hypopharynx</b> frequently have an advanced stage at diagnosis, {{and have the}} most adverse prognoses of pharyngeal tumors. They tend to metastasize early due to the extensive lymphatic network around the larynx.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hypopharynx</b> is {{a median}} lobe {{immediately}} behind the mouth, projecting forwards {{from the back}} of the preoral cavity; it is a lobe of uncertain origin, but perhaps associated with the mandibular segment; in apterygotes, earwigs, and nymphal mayflies, the <b>hypopharynx</b> bears a pair of lateral lobes, the superlinguae (singular: superlingua). It divides the cavity into a dorsal food pouch, or cibarium, and a ventral salivarium into which the salivary duct opens. It is commonly found fused to the libium. Most of the <b>hypopharynx</b> is membranous, but the adoral face is sclerotized distally, and proximally contains a pair of suspensory sclerites extending upwards to end in the lateral wall of the stomodeum. Muscles arising on the frons are inserted into these sclerites, which distally are hinged to a pair of lingual sclerites. These, in turn, have inserted into them antagonistic pairs of muscles arising on the tentorium and labium. The various muscles serve to swing the <b>hypopharynx</b> forwards and back, and in the cockroach, two more muscles run across the <b>hypopharynx</b> and dilate the salivary orifice and expand the salivarium.|$|E

25|$|The female {{mosquito}} {{does not}} insert its labium into the skin; it bends {{back into a}} bow when the mosquito begins to bite. The tip of the labium remains {{in contact with the}} skin of the victim, acting as a guide for the other mouthparts. In total, there are six mouthparts besides the labium: two mandibles, two maxillae, the <b>hypopharynx,</b> and the labrum.|$|E

25|$|The mouthparts, {{along with}} the rest of the head, can be {{articulated}} in at least three different positions: prognathous, opisthognathous, and hypognathous. In species with prognathous articulation, the head is positioned vertically aligned with the body, such as species of Formicidae; while in a hypognathous type, the head is aligned horizontally adjacent to the body. An opisthognathous head is positioned diagonally, such as species of Blattodea and some Coleoptera. The mouthparts vary greatly between insects of different orders, but the two main functional groups are mandibulate and haustellate. Haustellate mouthparts are used for sucking liquids and can be further classified by the presence of stylets, which include piercing-sucking, sponging, and siphoning. The stylets are needle-like projections used to penetrate plant and animal tissues. The stylets and the feeding tube form the modified mandibles, maxilla, and <b>hypopharynx.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mouthparts {{can have}} {{multiple}} functions. Some insects combine piercing parts along with sponging ones {{which are then}} used to pierce through tissues of plants and animals. Female mosquitoes feed on blood (hemophagous) making them disease vectors. The mosquito mouthparts consist of the proboscis, paired mandibles and maxillae. The maxillae form needle-like structures, called stylets, which are enclosed by the labium. When mosquito bites, maxillae penetrate the skin and anchor the mouthparts, thus allowing other parts to be inserted. The sheath-like labium slides back, and the remaining mouthparts pass through its tip and into the tissue. Then, through the <b>hypopharynx,</b> the mosquito injects saliva, which contains anticoagulants to stop the blood from clotting. And finally, the labrum (upper lip) is used to suck up the blood. Species of the genus Anopheles are characterized by their long palpi (two parts with widening end), almost reaching the end of labrum.|$|E
500|$|Immature mayflies are aquatic and are {{referred}} to as nymphs or naiads. In contrast to their short lives as adults, they may live for several years in the water. They have an elongated, cylindrical or somewhat flattened body that passes through a number of instars (stages), molting and increasing in size each time. When ready to emerge from the water, nymphs vary in length, depending on species, from [...] The head has a tough outer covering of sclerotin, often with various hard ridges and projections; it points either forwards or downwards, with the mouth at the front. There are two large compound eyes, three ocelli (simple eyes) and a pair of antennae of variable lengths, set between or in front of the eyes. The mouthparts are designed for chewing and consist of a flap-like labrum, a pair of strong mandibles, a pair of maxillae, a membranous <b>hypopharynx</b> and a labium.|$|E
2500|$|To {{understand}} the mosquito mouthparts, {{it is helpful}} to draw a comparison with an insect that chews food, such as a dragonfly. A dragonfly has two mandibles, which are used for chewing, and two maxillae, which are used to hold the food in place as it is chewed. The labium forms the floor of the dragonfly's mouth, the labrum forms the top, while the <b>hypopharynx</b> is inside the mouth and is used in swallowing. Conceptually, then, the mosquito's proboscis is an adaptation of the mouthparts that occur in other insects. The labium still lies beneath the other mouthparts, but also enfolds them, and it has been extended into a proboscis. The maxillae still [...] "grip" [...] the [...] "food" [...] while the mandibles [...] "bite" [...] it. The top of the mouth, the labrum, has developed into a channeled blade the length of the proboscis, with a cross-section like an inverted [...] "U". Finally, the <b>hypopharynx</b> has extended into a tube that can deliver saliva {{at the end of the}} proboscis. Its upper surface is somewhat flattened so, when pressed against it, the labrum forms a closed tube for conveying blood from the victim.|$|E
2500|$|The oropharynx, at {{the back}} of the mouth, forms a circle and {{includes}} the base of the tongue (posterior third) below, the tonsils on each side, and the soft palate above, together with the walls of the pharynx, including the [...] anterior epiglottis, epiglottic valleculae and branchial cleft at its base. [...] The oropharynx is one of three divisions of the interior of the pharynx based on their relation to adjacent structures (nasal pharynx (nasopharynx), oral pharynx (oropharynx) and laryngeal pharynx (laryngopharynx - also referred to as the <b>hypopharynx),</b> from top to bottom). The pharynx is a semicircular fibromuscular tube joining the nasal cavities above to the larynx (voice box) and oesophagus (gullet), below, where the larynx is situated in front of the oesophagus.|$|E

50|$|A URI may be {{classified}} by the area inflamed.Rhinitis affects the nasal mucosa, while rhinosinusitis or sinusitis affects {{the nose and}} paranasal sinuses, including frontal, ethmoid, maxillary, and sphenoid sunuses. Nasopharyngitis (rhinopharyngitis or the common cold) affects the nares, pharynx, <b>hypopharynx,</b> uvula, and tonsils generally. Without involving the nose, pharyngitis inflames the pharynx, <b>hypopharynx,</b> uvula, and tonsils. Similarly, epiglottitis (supraglottitis) inflames the superior portion of the larynx and supraglottic area; laryngitis is in the larynx; laryngotracheitis is in the larynx, trachea, and subglottic area; and tracheitis is in the trachea and subglottic area.|$|E
50|$|T2: {{the tumor}} {{has grown to}} affect more than one area of the <b>hypopharynx</b> and is between 2 and 4 centimeters with no lymph node {{involvement}} and no metastasis.|$|E
50|$|This {{particular}} reflex {{is simply}} {{one of several}} aero digestive reflexes, including also the pharyngoglottal closure reflex (in which no swallowing occurs yet the glottis still closes) and the pharyngo-upper esophageal sphincter contractile reflex, which occurs mainly during gastroesophageal reflux episodes. All either forcibly close the glottis or allow the pharynx to remove particles into the digestive tract {{that may have been}} forced back up by both this tract and the upper respiratory tract. These reflexes can also protect the airways from any food or liquids that may spill over from the <b>hypopharynx.</b> The <b>hypopharynx</b> is the bottom part of pharynx, and can be considered the first area where the digestive tract splits from the airways. However, if the maximum capacity of fluids that the <b>hypopharynx</b> can safely hold is exceeded, then this excess fluid spills into the larynx and from there into the lungs. Therefore, these reflexes prevent levels reaching this maximum volume.|$|E
