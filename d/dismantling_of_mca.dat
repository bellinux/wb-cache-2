40|$|To {{examine the}} ethnic {{differences}} in the uptake of professional maternity care assistance (MCA) in the Netherlands, and the factors that may explain these differences. Additionally the effect <b>of</b> <b>MCA</b> on health risk behaviour around infants is examined. Questionnaire survey. Questionnaire data from 3967 mothers from the ABCD study (Amsterdam Born Children and their Development) included during pregnancy in 2003 - 2004, were used. We examined the explanatory role of ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, mastery of the Dutch language, parity, housing situation and place of giving birth on MCA uptake, and the effect <b>of</b> <b>MCA</b> uptake on health risk behaviour around infants, such as smoking indoors, infant sleep behaviour, infant nutrition, and response to infant crying. Mothers of non-Western origin less often used MCA than Dutch mothers (Ghanaian: 70 %; Turkish: 75 %; Moroccan: 79 %; Surinamese: 81 %; Dutch Caribbean: 85 % vs. Dutch: 95 %). Higher educational level, better mastery of the Dutch language, having a paid job and home delivery were all independently associated with the uptake <b>of</b> <b>MCA,</b> and also partially explained {{ethnic differences in}} the uptake <b>of</b> <b>MCA.</b> Mothers who received MCA more often breastfed, more often gave vitamin K when not breastfeeding, and more often lived in smoke-free homes. The protective effect <b>of</b> <b>MCA</b> was stronger for non-Western mothers than for Dutch mothers. Mothers of non-Western origin make less use <b>of</b> professional <b>MCA.</b> Given that the use <b>of</b> <b>MCA</b> {{is associated with a}} less risk behaviour around infants, efforts should be made to improve the accessibility <b>of</b> professional <b>MCA</b> for mothers <b>of</b> non-Western origi...|$|R

40|$|Ca 2 + is {{important}} for plant growth and development as a nutrient and a second messenger. However, the molecular nature and roles of Ca 2 +-permeable channels or transporters involved in Ca 2 + uptake in roots are largely unknown. We recently identified {{a candidate for the}} Ca 2 +-permeable mechanosensitive channel in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), named MCA 1. Here, we investigated the only paralog <b>of</b> <b>MCA</b> 1 in Arabidopsis, <b>MCA</b> 2. cDNA <b>of</b> <b>MCA</b> 2 complemented a Ca 2 + uptake deficiency in yeast cells lacking a Ca 2 + channel composed of Mid 1 and Cch 1. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that MCA 2 was expressed in leaves, flowers, roots, siliques, and stems, and histochemical observation showed that an MCA 2 promoter::GUS fusion reporter gene was universally expressed in 10 -d-old seedlings with some exceptions: it was relatively highly expressed in vascular tissues and undetectable in the cap and the elongation zone of the primary root. mca 2 -null plants were normal in growth and morphology. In addition, the primary root <b>of</b> <b>mca</b> 2 -null seedlings was able to normally sense the hardness of agar medium, unlike that <b>of</b> <b>mca</b> 1 -null or mca 1 -null mca 2 -null seedlings, as revealed by the two-phase agar method. Ca 2 + uptake activity was lower in the roots <b>of</b> <b>mca</b> 2 -null plants than those of wild-type plants. Finally, growth <b>of</b> <b>mca</b> 1 -null mca 2 -null plants was more retarded at a high concentration of Mg 2 + added to medium compared with that <b>of</b> <b>mca</b> 1 -null and mca 2 -null single mutants and wild-type plants. These results suggest that the MCA 2 protein has a distinct role in Ca 2 + uptake in roots and an overlapping role with MCA 1 in plant growth...|$|R

40|$|Background: Atherosclerosis of {{intracranial}} vessels may progress or regress, {{however, the}} natural course of middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis {{has not been}} known well. Using Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, we attempt to reveal the frequency and the associated factors about progression or regression <b>of</b> <b>MCA</b> stenosis. Methods: Among patients with MCA stenosis on MRA (> 50 % narrowing), objects with repeated TCD exami-nations (interval> 6 months) were included. Mean flow velocity (MFV) changes over than 30 cm/sec were used as criteria for progression, stationary or regression <b>of</b> <b>MCA</b> stenosis. Demographic data, risk factors, and medi-cations were assessed to identify predictors of progression or regression. Results: Eighty-one MCA segments were analyzed (36 males, mean age 64 years). Mean follow-up period was 614 days (210 ~ 1457 days). Progression and regression were detected in 18. 5 % and 14. 8 %. With multivariate regression analysis, no clinical profiles, risk factors, medications were associated with progression or regression <b>of</b> <b>MCA</b> stenosis. Conclusions: With long term follow up, progression and regression <b>of</b> <b>MCA</b> stenosis is not uncommon, which means the intracranial atherosclerosis is a dynamic process. TCD seems to be useful in detecting progression or regression <b>of</b> <b>MCA</b> stenosis with optimal criteria. Predicting factors for progression and regression remain to b...|$|R

Specifically, the unstable fixed points embedded in the periodic and chaos orbit <b>of</b> the <b>MCA</b> dynamical system are stabilized by STM, the results of numerical simulation have been demonstrated.
