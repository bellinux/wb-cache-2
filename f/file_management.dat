25|$|As {{the number}} of {{independent}} processors in a supercomputer increases, the way they access data in the file system and how they share and access secondary storage resources becomes prominent. Over the years a number of systems for distributed <b>file</b> <b>management</b> were developed, e.g., the IBM General Parallel File System, BeeGFS, the Parallel Virtual File System, Hadoop, etc. A number of supercomputers on the TOP100 list such as the Tianhe-I use Linux's Lustre file system.|$|E

25|$|At WWDC 1996, Apple's new CEO, Gil Amelio, {{used the}} keynote to talk almost {{exclusively}} about Copland, {{now known as}} System 8. He repeatedly stated {{that it was the}} only focus of Apple engineering and that it would ship to developers at the end of summer with a full release planned for late fall. Very few, if any, demos of the running system were shown at the conference. Instead, various pieces of the technology and user interface that would go into the package (such as a new <b>file</b> <b>management</b> dialog) were demonstrated. Little of the core system's technology was demonstrated and the new file system that had been shown a year earlier was absent.|$|E
25|$|ZFS is unusual, because {{unlike most}} other storage systems, it unifies {{both of these}} roles and acts as both the volume manager and the file system. Therefore, it has {{complete}} knowledge of both the physical disks and volumes (including their condition, status, their logical arrangement into volumes, and also of all the files stored on them). ZFS is designed to ensure (subject to suitable hardware) that data stored on disks cannot be lost due to physical error or misprocessing by the hardware or operating system, or bit rot events and data corruption which may happen over time, and its complete control of the storage system is used to ensure that every step, whether related to <b>file</b> <b>management</b> or disk management, is verified, confirmed, corrected if needed, and optimized, {{in a way that}} storage controller cards, and separate volume and file managers cannot achieve.|$|E

500|$|Few methods {{exist for}} {{interface}} personalization. The Finder allows each icon {{to be assigned}} a color, but the desktop background is limited to an 8x8 pixel color tiled pattern (color patterns were introduced in System 5), and standard window frames are all black and white. However, many [...] "INIT" [...] extension files existed to add color and customization. System 7 later allowed the user to change the color and various {{other aspects of the}} user interface. By 1989, the System 6 user interface was in need of a change. In comparison to the NeXTSTEP operating system of the time, System 6 did not make use of sound, and its user interface presented several limitations in terms of <b>file</b> <b>management</b> and the way windows were displayed.|$|E
500|$|The Trash (or [...] "Wastebasket" [...] in the British version) empties {{when the}} Finder terminates. If MultiFinder is not running, this occurs {{as soon as}} an {{application}} launches. Icons on the desktop in System 6 are not organized into a single folder, as in later operating systems. Instead, the system records whether each file is on the desktop or not. This is inefficient and confusing, as the user cannot browse to the desktop in applications besides the Finder, even within the standard Open and Save As dialog boxes. Furthermore, these dialogs are primitive, mostly unchanged since 1984. The lack of aliases, shortcuts to files, was another limitation of <b>file</b> <b>management</b> on System 6. Custom file and folder icons are also not supported. These problems were all remedied in System 7.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{the project}} looked {{less like a}} new {{operating}} system {{and more like a}} huge collection of new technologies; QuickDraw GX, SOM, and OpenDoc became core components of the system, while completely unrelated technologies like a new <b>file</b> <b>management</b> dialog box (the [...] "open dialog") and [...] "themes" [...] support appeared as well. The feature list grew much faster than the features could be completed, a classic case of creeping featuritis.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} {{algorithms}} and data structures for low-level <b>file</b> system <b>management</b> is a well-explored research topic. File system data structures must be persistent across reboots. This has constrained {{the research of}} low-level <b>file</b> system <b>management</b> to algorithms which operate on diskbased structures. The advent of low latency, non-volatile memories such as Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM) justify revisiting the study of data structures and algorithms for low-level <b>file</b> system <b>management.</b> The Linking <b>File</b> System (LiFS) is a project which has taken advantage of MRAM technology to offer highperformance, enhanced semantic organization of files. We have taken this further, and have implemented an allocator and a file offset indexing algorithm which makes use of MRAM-based Red-Black Trees. We compare our algorithm’s performance with earlier disk-based and MRAMbased techniques. We discuss the relative benefits and weaknesses of each approach...|$|R
2500|$|The early Mac OS (simply named [...] "System") {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from many other operating systems {{from the same}} period because it does not use a command line interface; {{it was one of the}} first operating systems to use an entirely graphical user interface or GUI. It consists of two user-visible components: in addition to the system kernel, there is the Finder, an application used for <b>file</b> <b>management</b> that also displays the Desktop. The two files were contained in a folder directory labeled [...] "System Folder", which contained other resource files, like a printer driver, needed to interact with the System.|$|E
2500|$|On sol [...] (January 24, 2004) {{the rover}} repair team {{announced}} that the problem was with Spirits flash memory and the software that wrote to it. The flash hardware {{was believed to be}} working correctly but the <b>file</b> <b>management</b> module in the software was [...] "not robust enough" [...] for the operations the Spirit was engaged in when the problem occurred, indicating that the problem was caused by a software bug as opposed to faulty hardware. NASA engineers finally {{came to the conclusion that}} there were too many files on the file system, which was a relatively minor problem. Most of these files contained unneeded in-flight data. After realizing what the problem was, the engineers deleted some files, and eventually reformatted the entire flash memory system. On February 6 (sol 33), the rover was restored to its original working condition, and science activities resumed.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1999, Esri {{released}} ArcMap 8.0, {{which ran}} on the Microsoft Windows operating system. [...] ArcGIS combined the visual user-interface aspect of ArcView GIS 3.x interface {{with some of the}} power from the Arc/INFO version 7.2 workstation. This pairing resulted in a new software suite called ArcGIS including the command-line ArcInfo workstation (v8.0) and a new graphical user interface application called ArcMap (v8.0). This ArcMAP incorporating some of the functionality of ArcInfo with a more intuitive interface, as well as a <b>file</b> <b>management</b> application called ArcCatalog (v8.0). The release of the ArcMap constituted a major change in Esri's software offerings, aligning all their client and server products under one software architecture known as ArcGIS, developed using [...] Microsoft Windows COM standards. While the interface and names of ArcMap 8.0 are similar to later versions of ArcGIS Desktop, they are different products. ArcGIS 8.1 replaced ArcMap 8.0 in the product line but was not an update to it.|$|E

2500|$|For instance, {{printers}} {{were represented}} as a [...] "file" [...] at a known location when data was copied to the file, it printed out. Other systems, to provide a similar functionality, tended to virtualize devices at a lower level that is, both devices and files would be instances of some lower level concept. Virtualizing the system at the file level allowed users to manipulate the entire system using their existing <b>file</b> <b>management</b> utilities and concepts, dramatically simplifying operation. As {{an extension of the}} same paradigm, Unix allows programmers to manipulate files using a series of small programs, using the concept of pipes, which allowed users to complete operations in stages, feeding a file through a chain of single-purpose tools. Although the end result was the same, using smaller programs in this way dramatically increased flexibility as well as ease of development and use, allowing the user to modify their workflow by adding or removing a program from the chain.|$|E

The introduction of augmented reality development tools {{was seen as a}} potentially major debut, though critics noted the full potential would depend on third-party apps and how quickly developers adopt the new technology. The operating system was also praised for the App Store redesign, for updating Siri's voice, and for introducing the screen-recording utility and the Files app for <b>file</b> <b>management.</b> Shortly after release, it was discovered that disabling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections through the Control Center does not disable the respective chips in the device in order to remain functional for background connectivity, a design decision sparking criticism for [...] "misleading" [...] users and reducing security due to potential vulnerabilities in inactive open connections.|$|E
