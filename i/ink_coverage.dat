40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{spectral}} prediction model {{as well as}} new approaches for modeling ink spreading which occurs when printing ink layer superpositions. The spectral prediction model enhances the classical Clapper-Yule model by taking into account the fact that proportionally more incident light through a given colorant surface is reflected back onto the same colorant surface than onto other colorant surfaces. This is expressed by a weighted mean between a component specifying the part of the incident light which exits through the same colorant as the colorant from which it enters (Saunderson corrected Neugebauer component) and a component specifying the part of the incident light whose emerging light components exit from all colorants, with a probability to exit from a given colorant equal to that colorant surface coverage (Clapper-Yule component). We also propose two models for taking into account ink spreading, a phenomenon which occurs when printing an ink halftone in superposition with one or several solid inks. Besides the physical dot gain present within a single ink halftone print, we consider in the first model the ink spreading which occurs when an ink halftone is printed on top of one or two solid inks. In the second more advanced model, we generalize this concept to ink halftones printed on top or below solid inks. We formulate for both ink spreading models systems of equations which allow to compute effective <b>ink</b> <b>coverages</b> as a combination of the individual <b>ink</b> <b>coverages</b> which occur in the different superposition cases. The new spectral prediction model combined with advanced ink spreading yields excellent spectral predictions for clustered-dot color halftone prints, both in the case of offset (75 to 150 lpi) {{and in the case of}} thermal transfer printers (50 to 75 lpi) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Yule–Nielsen {{modified}} spectral Neugebauer model (YNSN) enhanced for {{accounting for}} ink spreading {{in the different}} ink superposition conditions provides accurate spectral predictions, but requires one to measure the reflectances of special halftone calibration patches in order to compute the ink spreading curves mapping nominal <b>ink</b> surface <b>coverage</b> to effective <b>ink</b> surface <b>coverage.</b> Printing special halftone calibration patches within {{the borders of the}} print pages is cumbersome, since these special patches need to be cut out before assembling the final printed product. In the present contribution, we calibrate the ink spreading curves directly from the printed images by fitting them so as to minimize a distance metric between predicted reflectances and measured reflectances at selected relatively uniform locations. We compare the prediction accuracy of the so-calibrated YNSN model with the prediction accuracy of the same model calibrated by the spectral reflectances of classical uniform calibration patches. Interestingly, when the model is calibrated from image tiles originating from the same or from a similar color image as the one comprising the test tiles, better prediction results are obtained than when performing a classical calibration on 50 % halftone patches printed in all superpositio...|$|R

We then establish the ink spreading curves mapping nominal dot surface coverages to effective dot surface coverages. By weighting the contributions of the different ink spreading curves according to the ratios of colorant surface coverages, we predict according to the YNSN model the reflectance spectra of the test patches. We compare the prediction accuracy of the YNSN model calibrated by digitized RGB intensities of the calibration patches with the prediction accuracy of the same model calibrated by the spectral reflectances of these calibration patches.

50|$|A simple {{indication}} {{of the quality of}} a printing press is the number of distribution and form rollers.

Business forms presses, which print very little coverage, usually only have one or two ink form rollers. Because of this, they cannot print large solid or screen images.

50|$|Newspapers use soy ink regularly, {{especially}} for color because {{it creates a}} sharper and brighter image. Color newspaper inks are more competitive to petroleum-based inks as well. They are only about five to ten percent more because the price is more due {{to the cost of}} the pigment, which is not as big a factor with black inks. Color soy inks are more widely accepted because they become the most quickly cost effective after savings in terms of excess pigment, VOC and printer cleanup costs. This “overall cost” for soy inks is significantly lower than the initial market price, and it is at this point that they become competitive with their petroleum counterparts. Soy inks also work well for label printing as they allow a reduction in <b>ink</b> <b>coverage</b> by 85% compared to water-based inks.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} full {{reproduction}} workflow for printing color images on metallic substrates. It relies on an ink spreading enhanced cellular Yule-Nielsen modified spectral Neugebauer model, calibrated with 35 color samples {{printed on the}} metal film and measured under specular reflection. The calibration accounts for the different phenomena contributing to the reflectance of halftone prints on metal: specular reflection by the metal film substrate of light traveling across the inks, illumination and viewing geometry, shadowing effect induced by the ink and difference in surface structure between the inked and non-inked metal halftone elements. The model enables predicting printable colors with an average CIELAB ∆E 94 error of 1. 7. Thanks to the model, the metal print gamut is established and a 3 D table provides the correspondence between printable metallic colors viewed under specular reflection and the corresponding <b>ink</b> surface <b>coverages.</b> The input sRGB gamut is mapped into the print gamut. At halftone image generation time, surface <b>coverages</b> of the <b>inks</b> yielding the desired gamut mapped input colors are obtained from the 3 D table. These <b>ink</b> surface <b>coverages</b> yield the <b>ink</b> separations that are halftoned and printed. The resulting color images printed on a silver substrate viewed under specular reflection reproduce the hues at {{a high degree of}} fidelity. The luminance of metallic prints under specular observation is generally higher than the luminance of paper under the same illuminating conditions.

40|$|Different inks {{may have}} {{different}} mechanical and/or optical properties. Existing Yule-Nielsen modified Neugebauer spectral prediction models assume however that the inks forming a color halftone behave similarly, i. e. that a single n-factor can model the lateral propagation of light within the paper as well as non-uniformities of the ink dot thickness profiles. However, if the inks have very different optical or mechanical properties, each ink may be separately modeled with its specific n-factor. In order to predict the reflection spectrum of such color halftones, we extend the ink spreading enhanced Yule-Nielsen modified spectral Neugebauer (EYNSN) model by calculating for each halftone an optimal n-factor as an average of the ink specific n-factors weighted by a parabolic function of the <b>ink</b> surface <b>coverages.</b> We compare the prediction accuracies of the standard EYNSN model where each halftone is predicted by making use of one global n-factor with the predictions accuracies of the extended EYNSN model where each halftone is predicted with its corresponding optimal n-factor derived from the individual ink-specific n-factors.

40|$|Members of {{the graphic}} arts {{industries}} are slowly {{becoming aware of}} undercolor reduction techniques used {{in the attempt to}} help stabilize high speed wet printing.

This separation method provides technical and cost benefits to the printer. An investigation of this reproduction technique forms the basis of this research project.

Regarding the stacks of transparencies, an experimental test carried out with inkjet printed samples shows good agreement between predictions and measurements for stacks of two, three and four transparencies. Stochastic halftones are used {{in order to avoid the}} apparition of moiré patterns when superposing the halftones. By inversion of the model, we are able to determine the halftone colors to print on each transparency in order to obtain by superposition one targeted color.

40|$|For {{accurate}} printing (reproduction), {{two important}} appearance attributes to consider are color and gloss. These attributes {{are related to}} two topics focused on in this dissertation: spectral reproduction and specular (gloss) printing. In the conventional printing workflow known as the metameric printing workflow, which we use mostly nowadays, high-quality prints [...] in terms of colorimetric accuracy [...] can be achieved only under a predefined illuminant (i. e. an illuminant that the printing pipeline is adjusted to; e. g. daylight). While this printing workflow is useful and sufficient for many everyday purposes, in some special cases, such as artwork (e. g. painting) reproduction, security printing, accurate industrial color communication and so on, in which accurate reproduction of an original image {{under a variety of}} illumination conditions (e. g. daylight, tungsten light, museum light, etc.) is required, metameric reproduction may produce satisfactory results only with luck. Therefore, in these cases, another printing workflow, known as spectral printing pipeline must be used, with the ideal aim of illuminant-invariant match between the original image and the reproduction. In this workflow, the reproduction of spectral raw data (i. e. reflectances in the visible wavelength range), rather than reproduction of colorimetric values (colors) alone (under a predefined illuminant) is taken into account. Due to the limitations of printing systems extant, the reproduction of all reflectances is not possible even with multi-channel (multi-colorant) printers. Therefore, practical strategies are required in order to map non-reproducible reflectances into reproducible spectra and to choose appropriate combinations of printer colorants for the reproduction of the mapped reflectances. For this purpose, an approach called Spatio-Spectral Gamut Mapping and Separation, SSGMS, was proposed, which results in almost artifact-free spectral reproduction under a set of various illuminants. The quality control stage is usually the last stage in any printing pipeline. Nowadays, the quality of the printout is usually controlled only in terms of colorimetric accuracy and common printing artifacts. However, some gloss-related artifacts, such as gloss-differential (inconsistent gloss appearance across an image, caused mostly by variations in deposited <b>ink</b> area <b>coverage</b> on different spots), are ignored, because no strategy to avoid them exists. In order to avoid such gloss-related artifacts and to control the glossiness of the printout locally, three printing strategies were proposed. In general, for perceptually accurate reproduction of color and gloss appearance attributes, understanding the relationship between measured values and perceived magnitudes of these attributes is essential. There has been much research into reproduction of colors within perceptually meaningful color spaces, but little research from the gloss perspective has been carried out. Most of these studies are based on simulated display-based images (mostly with neutral colors) and do not take real objects into account. In this dissertation, three psychophysical experiments were conducted in order to investigate the relationship between measured gloss values (objective quantities) and perceived gloss magnitudes (subjective quantities) using real colored samples printed by the aforementioned proposed printing strategies. These experiments revealed that the relationship mentioned can be explained by a Power function according to Stevens' Power Law, considering almost the entire gloss range. Another psychophysical experiment was also conducted in order to investigate the interrelation between perceived surface gloss and texture, using 2. 5 D samples printed in two different texture types and with various gloss levels and texture elevations. According to the results of this experiment, different macroscopic texture types and levels (in terms of texture elevation) were found to influence the perceived surface gloss level slightly. No noticeable influence of surface gloss on the perceived texture level was observed, indicating texture constancy regardless of the gloss level printed. The SSGMS approach proposed for the spectral reproduction, the three printing strategies presented for gloss printing, and the results of the psychophysical experiments conducted on gloss printing and appearance can be used to improve the overall print quality in terms of color and gloss reproduction...|$|R

The results of using four process color inks (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black) in various sequences in flexography were analyzed in this research. White oriented polypropylene (OPP) film was printed with UV inks on a Mark Andy LP 3000 flexo press. The sequences were analyzed based on differences in the color gamut, their volume, ability of the sequence to reproduce better-looking images, and rendering of maximum <b>ink</b> <b>coverage.</b> The results suggest there was no one particular sequence that was proved to be optimum. Among the five sequences (YMCK, MYCK, CMYK, KYMC, and KCMY) tested, only one (KCMY) printed well without producing any moiré-like pattern. The other four sequences (CMYK, YMCK, MYCK, and KYMC) did produce a moiré-like pattern in the heavy <b>ink</b> <b>coverage</b> or shadow regions of the print. However, the sequences showing the moiré-like pattern exhibited bigger color gamuts compared to the one that does not produce a moiré-like pattern. The actual cause for the moiré-like pattern formations is unknown. It may not be due to faulty screen angles. Instead it is suspected that it is related to the wetability of the CMY inks underneath the Black. Further research is needed to find the real reason for the formations of these moiré-like patterns. Thus, {{it will be difficult to}} have one optimum ink sequence for flexography, as one sequence may be preferable for obtaining a bigger gamut for a given hue angle, while some other sequence may produce better-looking images without any moiré-like printing artifacts appearing in the prints. If the image to be printed has more colors (requiring a bigger gamut) and limited or no shadow regions, it is recommended to print in the order of CMYK.

In addition, we noticed that dot gain curves obtained from the print samples with single ink printed on paper do not work well for the prints where ink is printed on another, or others. Therefore, dot gain curves for different ink superposition situations are optimized by matching the calculated tri-stimulus values of training patches to their measurement counterpoints.

In CSWO printing, the compressibility and conformability of the blanket and the compressibility of the newsprint surface improve the <b>ink</b> <b>coverage.</b> After the printing nip the ink film splits only in the area where it has been in contact with the newsprint surface. In single-colour printing, the penetration of ink that is caused by the pressure in the printing nip is insignificant. In contrast, in multi-colour printing, the ink layer printed later pushes the previously printed ink deeper into the voids of the paper surface. Ink setting decreases set-off. It is the result of solvent separation from the ink layer. Ink setting is defined by the change of the set-off during the delay time. Filler loading improves ink setting. Set-off can be reduced by using less ink, higher printing nip pressure, lower pressure in the folder and in other set-off situations, and chemical pulp containing less compressible DIP-based newsprint. The most important properties of uncoated newsprint for set-off are: optimised roughness in relation to print quality and set-off, low surface compressibility, high specific surface area, good absorption ability of the fines area and uniform formation (no high-density calendering spots). reviewe...|$|E
