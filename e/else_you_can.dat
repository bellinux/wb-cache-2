500|$|Eurogamer {{praised the}} [...] "beautiful {{architecture}} and {{interaction of the}} various races" [...] in Final Fantasy XII and noted {{that there was a}} [...] "melancholy feeling" [...] to [...] "wandering the barren wastes" [...] of Ivalice. In their review of Final Fantasy Tactics, IGN called the battle areas [...] "extremely well designed and detailed to perfection", singling out the churches as especially beautiful. GameSpot was similarly impressed with the wide varieties of [...] "beautiful" [...] terrains to be seen in Ivalice, from swamps to castles to [...] "anything <b>else</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> think of". PSXExtreme praised the feel of Lea Monde in Vagrant Story, calling it [...] "excellently lit" [...] in a style that brought out the [...] "dark and moody" [...] feeling of the game. They {{went on to say that}} the game's [...] "great visual presentation will go down in the books as one of the best looking [...] games".|$|E
500|$|Ross was {{impressed}} with the in-camera effects achieved for the series, but he would always propose visual effect alternatives to these on set because [...] "you have to embrace what VFX can do for you. The cost of spending half a day on a special scene has got to be worth it, or <b>else</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> just shoot a plate and do the rest in post and save yourself all that production time". Ross photographed all the series' sets as reference footage to work from in case a visual effect shot was ultimately required, explaining, [...] "Sometimes while looking at the assembly I’ll realize we need another shot but there isn’t any coverage that works. [...] us a starting point for building our new shots. And whether they are all-CG or just elements, we are always dealing with Noah’s aesthetic of making it look as real as possible." ...|$|E

Anny Tzotzadini of Greek Reporter believed that it would change the standards of marketing in Greece.|$|E

[...] The airfield at McGrath was almost midway between Anchorage and Nome, and 8 to 10 planes were landing there every day during the summer of 1940.|$|E

6000|$|... "He is a {{good old}} sort, Johnson; it seemed an easy thing. I said I would. Since that time I have been {{thinking}} how to do it. As a matter of fact, I have not thought of much <b>else.</b> Maybe <b>you</b> <b>can</b> suggest something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes! What <b>else</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> call it--when {{he offered}} to leave me free to plead my own cause with Lucilla? What <b>else</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> call it--when he showed me a future life, which was a life with Lucilla? Poor, dear, generous fellow, he tempted me to stay when {{he ought to have}} {{encouraged}} me to go. How could I resist him? Blame the passion that has got me body and soul: don't blame me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Scott, [...] "it's {{an amusing}} tale, {{but you had}} better not tell it to anybody <b>else.</b> Now <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go along, but see you keep out of trouble in future. If I find you talking about Driscoll, or quarreling with the boys, I'll butt in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No {{doubt you}} {{spend much of}} your time in reading, Mistress Ruth,' he remarked. 'It puzzles me to think what <b>else</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do so far from town?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not now," [...] she begged. [...] "If {{there is}} really {{anything}} <b>else,</b> Henry, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> send up a note, or I dare say we shall meet at the Club to-night.

6000|$|... "There {{is no need}} {{of saying}} {{anything}} more," [...] Hazelton interrupted, fearing the boy was about {{to speak of the}} money the proprietor of the museum had hidden. [...] "The merchant will understand and advise if you tell him everything--that is, I think he will; but in case he refuses, talk with some one <b>else</b> whom <b>you</b> <b>can</b> trust." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No? You {{will never}} persuade {{me that you}} are not. Why, what <b>else</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> ladies sit up half the night talking about in your bed rooms?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{want that}} pretty frock, Miss Dombey,' said Good Mrs Brown, 'and that little bonnet, and a {{petticoat}} or two, and anything <b>else</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> spare. Come! Take 'em off.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Quite so, Graheme," [...] {{the colonel}} said smiling; [...] "that's always the excuse {{of the boy}} who gets into scrapes. The {{question}} is, Why do these things always happen {{to you and to}} nobody <b>else?</b> If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> explain that your whole case is made out.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "here are two solid {{pages of}} them, but {{nobody seems to}} want a waiter. What <b>else</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> do?" [...] she asked smiling up at him.|$|R

6000|$|... "All {{the surf}} gets it keeps," [...] he said. [...] "If {{there is a}} secret, I reckon the secret's safe! However, {{we have to talk}} about {{something}} <b>else.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> get us some native boys?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, Hetty, there's nothing <b>else</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do, {{and your}} {{pictures}} {{are very important}} to us. Rest and enjoy yourself, and get strong and well. You are improving wonderfully in health since you came here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, surely," [...] I interposed, [...] "you {{must have}} some {{internal}} economy, or <b>else</b> how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> walk and talk? For example, have you a heart?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An odious creature," [...] {{she burst}} out again. [...] "Imagine {{a man who}} takes five lumps of sugar in his tea.... Yes, I said spiritualize! How <b>else</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> make discontent {{effective}} and universal?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Wilson! I'm {{so happy}} to see you on your horse again!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "It's too good to be true.

"Now, Mary," [...] Mr. Armstrong said, [...] "will you {{and your}} friends get a fresh table-cloth out, and bring in some cold meat and bread and {{anything}} <b>else</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> lay your hands on, for our brave friends? The rascals can't have had time to find out our cellar, and though I don't think any of our party want anything to eat, a draught of spirits and water will be acceptable all round." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{hard to tell}} you, my dear.
