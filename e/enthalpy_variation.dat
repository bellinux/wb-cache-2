40|$|The {{scope of}} this work was the {{determination}} of kinetic parameters of the thermal oxidative degradation of a Mediterranean scrub using a hybrid method developed at the laboratory. DSC and TGA were {{used in this study}} under air sweeping to record oxidative reactions. Two dominating and overlapped exothermic peaks were recorded in DSC and individualized using a experimental and numerical separation. This first stage allowed obtaining the <b>enthalpy</b> <b>variation</b> of each exothermic phenomenon. In a second time, a Model Free Method was applied on each isolated curve to determine the apparent activation energies. A reactional kinetic scheme was proposed for the global exotherm composed of two independent and consecutive reactions. In fine mean values of <b>enthalpy</b> <b>variation</b> and apparent activation energy previously determined were injected in a Model Fitting Method to obtain the reaction order and the preexponential factor of each oxidative reaction.

40|$|The Carnot factor versus <b>enthalpy</b> <b>variation</b> (heat) diagram {{has been}} used {{extensively}} for the second law analysis of heat transfer processes. With <b>enthalpy</b> <b>variation</b> (heat) as the abscissa and the Carnot factor as the ordinate the area between the curves representing the heat exchanging media on this diagram illustrates the exergy losses due to the transfer. It is also possible to draw the paths of working fluids in steady-state, steady-flow thermodynamic cycles on this diagram using the definition of “the equivalent temperature” as the ratio between the variations of enthalpy and entropy in an analyzed process. Despite the usefulness of this approach two important shortcomings should be emphasized. First, the approach is not applicable for the processes of expansion and compression particularly for the isenthalpic processes taking place in expansion valves. Second, {{from the point of}} view of rigorous thermodynamics, the proposed ratio gives the temperature dimension for the isobaric processes only. The present paper proposes to overcome these shortcomings by replacing the actual processes of expansion and compression by combinations of two thermodynamic paths: isentropic and isobaric. As a result the actual (not ideal) refrigeration and power cycles can be presented on equivalent temperature versus <b>enthalpy</b> <b>variation</b> diagrams. All the exergy losses, taking place in different equipments like pumps, turbines, compressors, expansion valves, condensers and evaporators are then clearly visualized. Moreover the exergies consumed and produced in each component of these cycles are also presented. The latter give the opportunity to also analyze the exergy efficiencies of the components. The proposed diagram is finally applied for the second law analysis of an ejector based refrigeration system...|$|E
40|$|Unlike pure {{substances}} that melt and solidify {{at a fixed}} temperature, some materials, such as the Karlsruhe Test Substance (methyl cellulose gel) freeze and thaw out over a range of temperatures. In this paper, the phase change process is studied using an equivalent volumetric <b>enthalpy</b> <b>variation</b> corresponding to the thermal field in the freezing or thawing zone instead of the latent heat appearing in the Stefan solution for the phase change of a pure substance. In {{order to determine the}} equivalent volumetric <b>enthalpy</b> <b>variation,</b> two different temperature distributions are assumed in the freezing zone of the substance undergoing a phase change. Results obtained from calculations applying this approach are compared with experimental measurements. Measurements of freezing-zone progression were made in the course of three freezing experiments where the first kind of boundary conditions were imposed on the samples. In addition, 35 values for thawing time have been taken from the literature presenting experiments made with the third kind of boundary conditions. Comparisons showed the best agreement when a quadratic temperature distribution was adopted. The proposed method seems to be useful for many practical applications, particularly because it allows calculations of the freezing or thawing time without necessitating the use of empirical parameters in Plank's original equation. © 1994.

40|$|International audienceThe Joule-Thomson {{inversion}} curve (JTIC), {{defined as}} the locus in the p-T plane where the adiabatic Joule-Thomson (JT) coefficient is zero, separates regions for which heating and cooling occur upon an isenthalpic expansion. JTIC calculation for mixtures is a clear matter for single-phase conditions.

40|$|The {{change in}} flow {{properties}} {{ahead of the}} bow shock of a Jovian entry body, resulting from absorption of radiation from the shock layer, is investigated. Ultraviolet radiation is absorbed by the free stream gases, causing dissociation, ionization, {{and an increase in}} enthalpy of flow ahead of the shock wave. As a result of increased fluid enthalpy, the entire flow field in the precursor region is perturbed. The variation in flow properties is determined by employing the small perturbation technique of classical aerodynamics as well as the thin layer approximation for the preheating zone.

40|$|Mitigating {{the risk}} of {{explosion}} by hot-surface ignition of a flammable mixture has motivated experimental and numerical studies to characterize this phenomenon. The current numerical approach involves {{the solution of the}} low Mach-number Navier–Stokes equations coupled with detailed chemistry of n-heptane using a flamelet approach. Previous work with flamelets characterized by total enthalpy has allowed the inclusion of heat transfer effects (conduction and radiation) on ignition, flame propagation, and flame extinction. Unfortunately, total enthalpy and the progress variable (extent of reaction), typically used for the chemistry tabulation, are not independent. The current work details the development of a novel technique based on modeling <b>enthalpy</b> <b>variations</b> through the use of unburned gas temperature. A transport equation for the unburned gas temperature which forms a key component of this technique is derived from an energy balance for a reacting flow problem.

40|$|We report {{here on a}} novel {{approach}} for the early runaway detection in chemical reactors, based on the integration of two kinds of sensors: i) a set of three Pt thermo-resistances for measuring the temperatures both within the reactor and in the cooling jacket and ii) an UV-visible probe for the indirect evaluation of the conversion through measurements of light absorbance. The measured variables (temperature and conversion) were used as input to our model based on the divergence calculation. The early warning detection system (EWDS) was tested for the sulphuric acid catalyzed esterification of acetic anhydride and methanol, a very simple reaction but releasing ~ 70 kJ per mole of anhydride consumed. The responses given by EWDS were examined during the simulation of runaway reactions in a lab-scale reactor working under batch isoperibolic conditions. Different chemical heat flows were generated by varying the concentration of the sulphuric acid and adding at once the acetic anhydride into the reactor. The behaviour of the detection criterion was evaluated comparing the EWDS signals using both temperature and conversion as input variables, with the responses obtained from only temperature measurements. A detailed kinetic model was also developed to solve the differential energy and mass balance equations and define the runaway boundaries. Results showed the importance of an input variable indirectly related to conversion in such kinds of processes where other <b>enthalpy</b> <b>variations</b> (i. e. due to an endothermic mixing of the reagents) may hide a runaway reaction occurring...|$|R

40|$|A two-dimensional, incompressible, isentropic, "mainly {{inviscid}} " {{model of}} the total tem-perature variation in a von Karman vortex street is developed with special consideration to {{the distribution of the}} total temperature change in finite vortex cores. These cores are made up of a region of varying vorticity, the inner bubble, and a bounding vortex sheet separating each bubble from the potential outer flow. A theoretical model for the inner flow is obtained by assuming that this is a region of low viscosity with elliptic streamlines having cyclic properties. For the highly viscous bounding regions two con-straints are imposed, namely that the contour integral of the jump in normal velocity component across the sheet be equal to zero and that the total circulation due to both regions equal the point vortex circulation seen by the outer potential flow.

40|$|The {{influence}} of sealing components on {{the stability of}} turbomachinery has become a key topic because oil and gas market is increasingly requiring high rotational speed and high efficiency, which implies the clearance reduction in the seals. The accurate prediction of the effective damping of the seals is critical to avoid instability issues. In recent years, "negativeswirl" swirl brakes have been employed to reverse the circumferential direction of inlet flow, changing {{the sign of the}} cross-coupled stiffness coefficients and generating stabilizing forces. Industries started to investigate, by experiments, the dynamical behavior of labyrinth seals. The experimental results of a 14 teeth-on-stator labyrinth seal with nitrogen, performed in the high-pressure seal test rig owned by GE Oil&Gas, are presented in the paper. Both experimental tests with positive and negative pre-swirl values were performed in order to investigate the pre-swirl effect on the cross-coupled stiffness coefficients. Concerning with the dynamic characterization of the seal, the fluid-structure interaction into the seal can be modelled by the bulk-flow numeric approach that is still more time efficient than computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Dealing with the onecontrol volume bulk-flow model, the thermodynamic process in the seal is considered isenthalpic, despite an expected <b>enthalpy</b> <b>variation</b> along the seal cavities, both for gas and steam applications. In this paper, the authors improve the state-of-the-art onecontrol volume bulk-flow model [1], by introducing the effect of the energy equation in the zero-order solution. In this way, the real gas properties are evaluated in a more accurate way because the <b>enthalpy</b> <b>variation,</b> expected through the seal cavities, is taken into account in the model. The authors, considering the energy equation only in the zero-order solution, assume that the enthalpy is not a function of the clearance perturbation (i. e. of the rotor perturbed motion). The energy equation links the continuity and the circumferential momentum equations. The density, in the leakage correlation, depends on the enthalpy, which is calculated (in the energy equation) {{on the basis of the}} circumferential velocity and of the fluid/rotor shear stress. Therefore, the leakage mass-flow rate and the fluid thermodynamic properties depend, indirectly, on the shear stresses. This fact is proved in the literature by several CFD simulations that investigate the leakage in the straightthrough labyrinth seals, hence, the energy equation allows to better characterize the physics of the problem. Overall, by taking into account the energy equation, a better estimation of the coefficients in the case of negative pre-swirl ratio has been obtained (as it results from the comparison with the experimental benchmark tests). The numerical results are also compared to the state-of-the-art bulk-flow model developed by Thorat and Childs (2010), highlighting the improvement obtained...|$|E

Mixture JTIC calculation is a clear matter for single-phase conditions; if the mixture splits in two or more equilibrium phases, derivatives properties are not defined. However, in practice a system may change its state during an isenthalpic expansion (i. e., a phase boundary is crossed between initial and final conditions); such situations are not uncommon in petroleum engineering applications. Recently, several JTIC construction procedures were proposed for two-phase vapor-liquid systems (D. V. Nichita, C. F. Leibovici, Calculation of Joule-Thomson Inversion Curves for Two-Phase Mixtures, Fluid Phase Equilibria 2006, 246, 167 - 176).

In this work we present a method for JTIC calculation in multiphase systems, based on isenthalpic flash calculations, with emphasis on mixtures with solid-phase precipitation. Effects {{of the presence of}} a solid phase on the JTIC can be very important, since wax precipitation may occur in natural hydrocarbon systems (crude oils and gas condensates) at temperatures as high as 350 K.

40|$|AbstractDifferential {{scanning}} calorimetry (DSC) {{was applied}} to ascertain the effect caused by K+, Na+, ATP, detergent, DPPC, DPPE, and subunit γ on the thermostability of Na,K-ATPase. The <b>enthalpy</b> <b>variation</b> (ΔH) for the thermal denaturation of the membrane-bound is twice the ΔH value obtained for solubilized Na,K-ATPase. Denaturation occurs in five steps for membrane-bound against three steps for the solubilized enzyme, therefore a multi-step unfolding process. In the presence of Na+, the melting temperature is 61. 6 °C, and the ΔH is lower {{as compared with the}} ΔH obtained in the presence or in the absence of K+. Addition of ATP does not alter the transition temperatures significantly, but the shape of the curve is modified. Subunit γ probably stabilizes Na,K-ATPase in the beginning of thermal unfolding, and different amounts of detergents in the solubilized sample change the protein stability. Reconstitution of Na,K-ATPase into a liposome shows that lipids exert a protector effect. These results reveal differences on the thermostability depending on the conformation of Na,K-ATPase. They are relevant because it allows a comparison with future studies, e. g. how the composition of the membrane interferes on the stability of Na, K-ATPase, elucidating the importance of the lipid type contained in cell membrane...|$|E
40|$|A heat {{conduction}} microcalorimeter {{is used for}} the determination of activated carbon immersion enthalpies in phenol aqueous solutions. The microcalorimeter is electrically calibrated with values for the calibration constant between 13. 15 ± 0, 43 WV- 1 and 15. 24 ± 0, 28 WV- 1 and is chemically calibrated with the HCl-NaOH neutralization reaction system, obtaining a value for the neutralization enthalpy of- 56. 64 ± 0, 01 kJ mol- 1 which agrees with literature reports. The adsorption capacity and the immersion enthalpies of a commercial coal, Carbochem PS- 30, are determined in phenol aqueous solutions of different concentration, from 10 to 100 mgL- 1, at three temperatures 298, 308 y 318 K, obtaining values for the immersion enthalpies ranging between 15, 00 and 36, 00 Jg- 1, in the experimental conditions established. INTRODUCTIÓN On the free surface of a solid, thanks to the existence of a field of force, an increase in the concentration of the adsorbate molecules is produced, and when adsorption occurs, these are immobilized if the adsorption is localized. This process is spontaneous, so Gibbs free energy, ∆G, diminishes and, since the molecules turn to an adsorbed state, the entropy of the adsorbate-adsorbent system also diminishes. When combining these two facts and using the <b>enthalpy</b> <b>variation</b> expression, ∆H, we get: ∆H = ∆G + T∆S < 0 (1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSolid phase {{precipitation}} {{can greatly}} affect thermal effects in isenthalpic expansions; wax precipitation may occur in natural hydrocarbon {{systems in the}} range of operating conditions, the wax appearance temperature being significantly higher (as high as 350 K) for hyperbaric fluids. Recently, methods for calculating the Joule-Thomson inversion curve (JTIC) for two-phase mixtures, and for three-phase vapor-liquid-multisolid systems have been proposed. In this study, an approach for calculating the JTIC for the vapor-liquid-solid solution systems is presented. The JTIC is located by tracking extrema and angular points of <b>enthalpy</b> departure <b>variations</b> versus pressure at isothermal conditions. The proposed method is applied to several complex synthetic and naturally occurring hydrocarbon systems. The JTIC can exhibit several distinct branches (which may lie within two- or three-phase regions or follow phase boundaries), multiple inversion temperatures at fixed pressure, as well as multiple inversion pressures at given temperature...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} for the thermodynamics of the seasonal meridional energy balance and thermal {{structure of the}} Uranian atmosphere. The model considers radiation and small-scale convection, and dynamical heat fluxes due to large-scale baroclinic eddies. Phase oscillations with a period of 0. 5 Uranian year are discerned in the total internal power and global <b>enthalpy</b> storage. The <b>variations</b> in {{the identity of the}} main transport agent with the magnitude of the internal heat source are discussed. It is shown that meridional heat transport in the atmosphere is sufficient to lower seasonal horizontal temperature contrasts below those predicted with radiative-convection models...|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} behaviour of Cu 2 + onto maghnite {{was conducted}} under batch conditions. The effect of time, pH of the dispersion, temperature and initial metal concentration on the adsorption of Cu 2 + onto maghnite was investigated. In this study, 94 % of Cu(II), was adsorbed on the maghnite clay when the equilibrium was reached at 120 min. The adsorption of Cu 2 + was a fast process {{that followed the}} pseudo-second-order kinetics. This process could be described by the Langmuir model and gave a maximum Cu 2 + adsorption capacity of 21. 78 mg/g at 293 K. The thermodynamic parameters such as <b>variation</b> of <b>enthalpy</b> ΔH, <b>variation</b> of entropy ΔS and variation of Gibbs free energy ΔG were calculated from the slope and intercept of lnKd vs. 1 /T plots. The adsorption was endothermic reaction. The adsorption process for this natural maghnite is more spontaneous because the values of ΔG are less negative. The results suggested that natural maghnite was suitable as sorbent material for the recovery and adsorption of metal ion from aqueous solutions...|$|R
