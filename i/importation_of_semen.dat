40|$|Strategies of {{selection}} within local populations and of <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> and embryos from countries with higher genetic merit are evaluated for genetic improvement of milk yield in Zimbabwe. Local programs are progeny testing {{in a closed}} population, progeny testing com-bined with semen importation to sire 30 % of cows, progeny testing with for-eign sires as sires of bulls, and a closed nucleus selection scheme using embryo transfer started from elite imported stock. Strategies based on continuous importa-tion are imported semen for 30, 50, or 100 % of cows and semen from elite foreign bulls used on local elite cows and bulls from elite imported embryos. Gene flow methods were used to esti-mate the genetic means for the strategies. In predicted genetic response at 25 yr, continuous importation of all semen from the superior exporting country ranks first; second is the importation of elite embryos to provide bulls for AI; and third is the closed nucleus scheme using embryo transfer. Schemes involv-ing <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> to breed bulls with local progeny testing are intermedi-ate, and the lowest responses come from semen imported to breed cows and from the closed local progeny-testing scheme.

40|$|During {{the past}} decades, genetic {{improvement}} of dairy cattle in Costa Rica has depended upon massive importation of germplasm from temperate countries. This {{may not be}} an optimal alternative if genetic x environment interactions are significant or production goals differ among countries. The purpose of this dissertation was to develop a bioeconomic model to describe performance of dairy cows under production circumstances found in Costa Rica. Several studies were undertaken to quantify the effect of genetic and environmental factors on milk yield and reproduction performance of the local cattle population. The final model was used to optimize replacement and inseminations policies for herds with different feeding strategies and to determine the economic values of production and functional traits to be included in a breeding goal. Finally, a study was conducted to compare several breeding strategies {{on the basis of the}} genetic response achieved after twenty-five years of selection. When significant genotype x environment interactions were assumed strategies based on selection within the local population performed better than strategies based on <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> <b>semen...</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The captive {{elephant}} {{population is}} not self-sustaining {{and with a}} limited number of breeding bulls, its genetic diversity is in decline. One way to overcome this is to import young and healthy animals from the wild. We introduce here a more sustainable alternative method - <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> from wild bulls without removing them from their natural habitat. Due to the logistics involved, the only practical option would be to transport cryopreserved sperm. Despite some early reports on African elephant semen cryopreservation, the utility of this new population management tool has not been evaluated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Semen was collected by electroejaculation from 14 wild African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) bulls and cryopreserved using the directional freezing technique. Sperm treatments evaluated included the need for centrifugation, the use of hen or quail yolk, the concentration of glycerol (3 %, 5 % or 7 %) in the extender, and maintenance of motility over time after thawing. Our results suggest that dilution in an extender containing hen yolk and 7 % glycerol after centrifugation best preserved post-thaw sperm motility when compared to all other treatments (P≤ 0. 012 for all). Using this approach we were able to achieve after thawing (mean ± SD) 54. 6 ± 3. 9 % motility, 85. 3 ± 2. 4 % acrosome integrity, and 86. 8 ± 4. 6 % normal morphology with no decrease in motility over 1 h incubation at 37 °C. Sperm cryopreserved during this study has already lead to a pregnancy of a captive female elephant following artificial insemination. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: With working techniques for artificial insemination and sperm cryopreservation of both African and Asian elephants in hand, population managers can now enrich captive or isolated wild elephant populations without removing valuable individuals from their natural habitat...|$|E

As only 2 rams survived quarantine, the US flock is genetically descended from these 2 sire lines with only an additional <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> frozen sheep <b>semen</b> {{in the late}} 1990s to add some genetic diversity to the US herds. 9 ewes formed the foundation population.|$|R
40|$|Past {{breeding}} {{strategies for}} dairy cattle {{have been very}} effective in producing rapid genetic gain to achieve industry targets and raise profitability. Such gains have been largely facilitated by intense selection of sires combined {{with the use of}} artificial insemination. However, this practice can potentially limit the level of genetic diversity through inbreeding and selection plateaus. The rate of inbreeding in Australia is increasing, primarily as a result <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> <b>importation</b> from a small number of prominent bulls from the USA. The effect of this genetic influx in the Australian dairy cattle population is poorly understood both in terms of diversity and local adaptation/divergence. This study uses 845 genome-wide SNP genetic markers and 431 bulls to characterize the level of genetic diversity and genetic divergence within the Australian and international Holstein Friesian dairy population. No significant differences in genetic diversity (as measured by heterozygosity [Ho] and allelic richness [A]) were observed over the 25 -year time period (1975 – 1999) for bulls used in Australia. The <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> foreign <b>semen</b> into Australia has increased the effective population size until it was in effect a sub-sample of the global population. Our data indicate that most individuals are equally closely related to one another, regardless of country of origin and year of birth. In effect, the global population can be considered as one single population unit. These results indicate that inbreeding, genetic drift and selection has had little effect at reducing genetic diversity and differentiating the Australian Holstein Friesian population at a genome-wide level...|$|R
40|$|In August 2006, {{bluetongue}} (BT) {{was notified}} in The Netherlands on several animal holdings. This was {{the onset of}} a rapidly spreading BT-epidemic in north-western Europe (latitude > 51 °N) that affected cattle and sheep holdings in The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France and Luxembourg. The outbreaks were caused by bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 8, which had not been identified in the European Union before. Bluetongue virus can be introduced into a free area by movement of infected ruminants, infected midges or by infected semen and embryos. In this study, information on animal movements or transfer of ruminant germ plasms (semen and embryos) into the Area of First Infection (AFI), which occurred {{before and during the}} onset of the epidemic, were investigated in order to establish the conditions for the introduction of this virus. All inbound transfers of domestic or wild ruminants, non-susceptible mammal species and ruminant germ plasms into the AFI during the high-risk period (HRP), registered by the Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES) of the EC, were obtained. Imports originating from countries with a known or suspected history of BTV-incidence of any serotype were identified. The list of countries with a reported history of BTV incidence was obtained from the OIE Handistatus II for the period from 1996 until 2004. No ruminants were imported from a Member State (MS) with a known history of BTV- 8 or from any other country with a known or suspected history of BTV incidence of any serotype. Of all non-susceptible mammal species only 233 horses were transported directly into the AFI during the HRP. No <b>importations</b> <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> or embryos into the AFI were registered in TRACES during the period of interest. An obvious source for the introduction of BTV- 8, such as import of infected ruminants, could not be identified and the exact origin and route of the introduction of BTV- 8 thus far remains unknown. However, the absence of legal import of ruminants from outside the EU into the AFI and the absence of BTV- 8 in southern Europe suggest that, the introduction of the BTV- 8 infection into the north-western part of Europe took place via another route. Specifically, in relation to this, the potential for Culicoides to be imported along with or independently of the import of animals, plants or other `materials¿, and the effectiveness of measures to reduce such a possibility, merit further study...|$|R
40|$|Please see Read Me fileThe honey bee, Apis mellifera, is the world’s most {{important}} pollinator and is ubiquitous in most agricultural ecosystems. Four major evolutionary lineages {{and at least}} 24 subspecies are recognised. Commercial populations are mainly derived from subspecies originating in Europe (75 - 95 %). The Africanized honey bee is a New World hybrid of A. m. scutellata from Africa and European subspecies, with the African component making up 50 - 90 % of the genome. Africanized honey bees are considered undesirable for beekeeping in most countries, due to their extreme defensiveness and poor honey production. The international trade in honey bees is restricted, {{due in part to}} bans on <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> queens (and <b>semen)</b> from countries where Africanized honey bees are extant. Some desirable strains from the United States of America that have been bred for traits such as resistance to the mite Varroa destructor are unfortunately excluded from export to countries like Australia due to the presence of Africanized honey bees in the USA. This study shows that a panel of 95 single nucleotide polymorphisms, chosen to differentiate between the African, Eastern European and Western European lineages, can detect Africanized honey bees {{with a high degree of}} confidence via ancestry assignment. Our panel therefore offers a valuable tool to mitigate the risks of spreading Africanized honey bees across the globe and may enable the resumption of queen and bee semen imports from the Americas...|$|R
