50|$|European Union roaming {{regulations}} (sometimes {{called the}} <b>Eurotariff)</b> regulate {{the imposition of}} roaming charges within the European Economic Area (EEA), which consists of the member states of the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. They regulate both the charges mobile network operator can impose on its subscribers for using telephone and data services outside of the network's member state, and the wholesale rates networks can charge each other to allow their subscribers access to each other's networks.|$|E
50|$|The charge {{limits for}} the <b>Eurotariff</b> and the {{wholesale}} average charge should be calculated {{to the maximum}} number of decimal places permitted by the official exchange rate. This sets the maximum that can be charged in the national currency. Providers may wish in practice to quote charges in whole numbers of currency units, especially at the retail level, although this in practice is not compulsory. In this case, the numbers should be rounded down. Rounding up of these numbers to above the level of the relevant cap is not permitted under any circumstances.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents an}} analysis of the European Telecommunication strategic environment with particular focus on the three macro-changes which have been influencing the recent history of such industry. These are, first of all, the shift from a government-controlled market to a privatized market. Second, the introduction of price limitations - called <b>Eurotariff</b> - which are supposed to regulate the mobile traffic throughout Europe. Finally, the constant growth of data and internet traffic demand, compared to the voice traffic demand, mainly due to the success of OTTs (Over-the-Tops) and the introduction of NGN (Next-Generation Network) applications and software. Such changes have increased the competition in an industry which was organized in monopolies and are forcing the companies to change, following the different customers' needs. Throughout the essay, a case study about Telefónica has been developed: after a presentation of the company and of Telefónica's deregulation process, the consequences of the environment analysis will be defined and, finally, some strategic actions will be proposed in order to adapt to the new strategic environment. The methodology which has been followed consists in a research on the models existing in literature designed to analyze the strategic environment. The best ones have been used and applied to the real case, involving Telefónica: the findings obtained have then been considered the basis to define the strategic actions. The purpose of the paper is twofold: first of all to offer an understanding of the telecommunications business with a particular focus on the <b>Eurotariff,</b> OTTs and NGN phenomena; second to show how a strategic environment can be effectively studied, focusing on the changes that characterize the industry, and how the consequences can be deduced. The information coming from this type of studies is very important for a company to understand what to change in order to adapt to a new context and achieve better performances...|$|E
