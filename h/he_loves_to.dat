25|$|Although Carlo has {{sworn to}} change his ways, he has also given his oath of lifelong {{allegiance}} to his band of robbers. He cannot allow the woman <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> be dragged down into his world of degradation and disgrace and he cannot escape his own evil fate; he resolves this paradox by stabbing Amalia to death. Carlo rushes offstage claiming he is going {{in search of his}} own death.|$|E

500|$|After the race, Secretariat {{was brought}} to Aqueduct Racetrack where he was paraded with Turcotte dressed in the Meadow silks before a crowd of 32,990 in his final public appearance. [...] "It's a sad day, and yet it's a great day", said Laurin. [...] "I {{certainly}} wish he could run as a 4-year-old. He's a great horse and <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> run." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers of Illinois have {{compared}} Stevens' style to Steve Reich, Vince Guaraldi, the Danielson Famile, Neil Young, Nick Drake, and Death Cab for Cutie. Stevens' use of large orchestral arrangements in his music—much of it played by {{himself through the}} use of multi-track recording—has been noted by several reviewers. Rolling Stone summarized the musical influences of Illinois, saying [...] "the music draws from high school marching bands, show tunes and ambient electronics; we can suspect Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians is an oft-played record in the Stevens household, since <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> echo it in his long instrumental passages." [...] A review in The A.V. Club referred to some of the vocal work as [...] "regressively twee communalism", but found Stevens' music overall to be [...] "highly developed". The song [...] "Come On! Feel the Illinoise!" [...] uses a saxophone part from [...] "Close to Me" [...] by The Cure.|$|E

500|$|California Chrome's first graded stakes win was the March 8 Grade II San Felipe Stakes. Espinoza tried a {{different}} riding tactic {{and let the}} horse go to the lead {{right out of the}} gate. [...] California Chrome led most of the way, and after Espinoza gave him one tap on the shoulder with the whip, the horse pulled away from the field {{at the top of the}} homestretch and won by [...] lengths. Alan Sherman said, [...] "My jaw dropped", while Art Sherman joked, [...] "I'm glad I'm training at Los Alamitos, because he looked like a 350 [...] horse coming out of the gate"; a reference to Quarter Horse racing sprint distances. Espinoza remarked, [...] "I wanted to let him enjoy his race," [...] later adding, [...] "I wanted to see if he [...] go wire to wire... that was the day I found out how much <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> run." [...] The San Felipe was California Chrome's first win in a race open to all three-year-olds, not just California-breds, and earned him 50 points in the Road to the Kentucky Derby system.|$|E
2500|$|Gayle {{is known}} for his {{characteristic}} hitting, imposing physique, and timing. He attributes the latter to being very thin when young, and having a heavy bat. He {{is known for}} appearing very calm as the bowler approaches. [...] "Tall and imposing at the crease, <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> carve through the covers off either foot, and has the ability to decimate the figures of even the thriftiest of opening bowlers" [...] recorded Wisden and CricInfo. He holds numerous records that reflect his batting style, including record Twenty20 strike-rates and high scores.|$|E
2500|$|Although Joe's {{place of}} origin is Japan, he spent the {{majority}} of his time in Thailand, where he trained Muay Thai. It was through his victories that Joe got the nickname [...] "Hurricane Upper" [...] Joe Higashi. Joe earned his title as the champion of Muay Thai by beating Hwa Jai in a Muay Thai only tournament. Hwa Jai later joined the King of Fighters tournament in order to exact revenge against Joe but failed, and after admitting his defeat they're good friends and sparring partners. Ever since then, Joe has been defending his title against lesser opponents. At first, Joe was a stoic character who lived for fighting and training. As time passed, he becomes a pretty goofy man who self proclaims himself to be a genius with mostly everything. He does not take battle as serious as the Bogards, but <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> fight. He dates , the sister of Geese Howard's right-hand man, Billy Kane. Billy greatly disapproves this, normally going to the point of [...] "rescuing" [...] his sister from Joe.|$|E

2500|$|Stanley is Eddie's next-door neighbor, who {{is obsessed}} with Raven. He serves as the primary {{antagonist}} of the show, he has a frenemy relationship with Eddie and Cory, although he is usually seen scamming them. Stanley was originally brought in as a love interest for Raven's next-door neighbor, Sierra, but he becomes {{much more interested in}} Raven, and in one episode, Loka. Stanley is rude, obnoxious, mean, sarcastic, and deceptive to everyone. He is a young salesman, who usually tricks Cory into buying something that would eventually go wrong. Stanley is always trying desperately to get Raven to like him, but he suddenly leaves her alone after seeing her kiss Andre in the episode [...] "Mr. Perfect". <b>He</b> <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> eat cheese sandwiches. He also competes against Chelsea in a ping-pong match, and loses. In the same episode ("Taken to the Cleaners"), he asks Victor to make him a cheese sandwich {{in the shape of a}} ping-pong paddle. His catchphrases include [...] "My brotha!", which he exclaims whenever he is trying to [...] "show someone up"; and [...] "I may have said that, but I say a lot of things." [...] This is a partial denial of his ability to be nice to other people. He appears primarily in Seasons 3 and 4, in the episodes [...] "Opportunity Shocks"; [...] "Taken to the Cleaners"; [...] "The Grill Next Door"; [...] "Mr. Perfect"; [...] "The Four Aces"; [...] "Driving Miss Lazy"; [...] "Sister Act"; [...] "Checkin' Out"; [...] "Fur Better or Worse" [...] and [...] "When 6021 Met 4267".

He got into the [...] "Up with Goodness" [...] program, feigned an ankle injury, and stole Cory's presentation. It is also noted that he has a fear of bones, which helps Cory prove that Stanley faked the injury and stole his presentation.|$|E
