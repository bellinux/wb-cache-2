5|$|In late 1944, the Australian Government {{committed}} twelve Australian Army brigades {{to replace}} six US Army divisions which were conducting defensive roles in Bougainville, New Britain and the Aitape-Wewak area in New Guinea. While the US units had largely conducted a static defence of their positions, their Australian replacements mounted offensive operations designed {{to destroy the}} remaining Japanese forces in these areas. The value of these campaigns was controversial {{at the time and}} remains so to this day. The Australian Government authorised these operations for primarily political reasons. It was believed that keeping the Army involved in the war would give Australia greater <b>influence</b> <b>in</b> any post-war peace conferences and that liberating Australian territories would enhance Australia's <b>influence</b> <b>in</b> its region. Critics of these campaigns argue that they were unnecessary and wasteful of the lives of the Australian soldiers involved as the Japanese forces were already isolated and ineffective.|$|E
