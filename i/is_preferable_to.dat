Argon <b>is</b> <b>preferable</b> <b>to</b> the helium {{that had been used}} in the preceding five decades, because helium gas escapes through the intermolecular pores in most containers and must be regularly replaced.|$|E
5|$|Soil {{contains}} organic material, {{but because}} of the likelihood of contamination by humic acid of more recent origin, {{it is very difficult to}} get satisfactory radiocarbon dates. It <b>is</b> <b>preferable</b> <b>to</b> sieve the soil for fragments of organic origin, and date the fragments with methods that are tolerant of small sample sizes.|$|E
5|$|For {{infants and}} young children, orotracheal {{intubation}} {{is easier than}} the nasotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal intubation route <b>is</b> <b>preferable</b> <b>to</b> orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation of the tube. As with adults, {{there are a number}} of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal intubation in children. Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal tube is accomplished as with adult patients.|$|E

5|$|In chapter five Goldacre {{suggests}} {{using the}} General Practice Research Database in the UK, which contains the anonymized records of several million patients, to conduct randomized trials {{to determine the}} most effective of competing treatments. For example, to compare two statins, atorvastatin and simvastatin, doctors would randomly assign patients to one or the other. The patients would be followed up by having data about their cholesterol levels, heart attacks, strokes and deaths taken from their computerized medical records. The trials would not be blind– patients would know which statin they had been prescribed– but Goldacre writes {{that they would be}} unlikely to hold such firm beliefs about which one <b>is</b> <b>preferable</b> <b>to</b> the extent that it could affect their health.|$|E
5|$|One way of {{clustering}} {{a set of}} {{data points}} in a metric space into two clusters is to choose the clusters {{in such a way}} as to minimize the sum of the diameters of the clusters, where the diameter of any single cluster is the largest distance between any two of its points. This <b>is</b> <b>preferable</b> <b>to</b> minimizing the maximum cluster size, which may lead to very similar points being assigned to different clusters. If the target diameters of the two clusters are known, a clustering that achieves those targets may be found by solving a 2-satisfiability instance. The instance has one variable per point, indicating whether that point belongs to the first cluster or the second cluster. Whenever any two points are too far apart from each other for both to belong to the same cluster, a clause is added to the instance that prevents this assignment.|$|E
5|$|Luther lists several criticisms {{advanced}} by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing {{rather than his}} own criticisms. How should he answer those who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory {{if it is in}} his power? What should he say to those who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were for the sake of those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would cease to be relevant. Luther closes the Theses by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven <b>is</b> <b>preferable</b> <b>to</b> false security.|$|E

25|$|Civil–military {{relations}} (Civ-Mil or CMR) {{describes the}} relationship between civil {{society as a whole}} and the military organization or organizations established to protect it. More narrowly, it describes {{the relationship between}} the civil authority of a given society and its military authority. Studies of civil-military relations often rest on a normative assumption that civilian control of the military <b>is</b> <b>preferable</b> <b>to</b> military control of the state. The principal problem they examine, however, is empirical: to explain how civilian control over the military is established and maintained.|$|E

According to the current definition, two fasting glucose measurements above 126mg/dl (7.0mmol/l) is considered diagnostic for diabetes mellitus.|$|E

However, an outside corner is generally stronger than an inside corner.|$|R

In other words, to convert the text from an image to editable text (that is, a string of character codes), a person could re-type it, or a computer could look at the image and deduce what each character is. OCR technology has already reached an impressive state (for example, Google Book Search) and promises more for the future.|$|E

When a function is called with fewer arguments than there are declared parameters, explicit arguments are matched to parameters in left-to-right order, with any unmatched parameters {{at the end of the}} parameter list being assigned their default arguments. In many cases, specifying default arguments in a single function declaration <b>is</b> <b>preferable</b> <b>to</b> providing overloaded function definitions with different numbers of parameters.|$|E
