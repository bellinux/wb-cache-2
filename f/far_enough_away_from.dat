5|$|In the Late Classic (c. 600 c. 900), {{alliance}} with Calakmul frequently {{was associated with}} the promise of military support. The fact that Copán, a much more powerful city than Quiriguá, failed to retaliate against its former vassal implies that it feared the military intervention of Calakmul. Calakmul itself was <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Quiriguá that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat was not afraid of falling directly under its power as a full vassal state, even though it is likely that Calakmul sent warriors to help in the defeat of Copán. The alliance instead seems to have been one of mutual advantage, Calakmul managed to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal while Quiriguá gained its independence.|$|E
5|$|Another man {{is found}} dead by a self-inflicted bullet wound, though Dana was seen leaving his {{apartment}}. Evidence {{in his apartment}} points {{to the construction of}} a bomb, and the Fringe team suspects that Dana knows its location and may be hoping to exploit an event which will kill several people simultaneously in order to increase her own chances of death. Peter calls her, using caller ID spoofing to disguise his number as that of her late husband, and the signal allows authorities to pinpoint her location to a commuter train. The train is stopped and searched, while Dana leaves on her own with the bomb, moving it <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the train. The bomb soon explodes, and when Peter and Lincoln search, they find Dana's body nearby, finally dead, and the only fatality from the explosion.|$|E

The more compact {{structure of the}} CLEO II detector allowed the muon detectors to be {{moved closer to the}} interaction point. Three layers of muon detectors were placed behind layers of iron absorbers. The streamer counters were read out from each end to determine the z position.|$|R
50|$|Méliès himself plays Gulliver in the film. The visual {{differences}} of scale between Gulliver and the countries he visits were created using multiple exposures and miniature models; Méliès uses substitution splices and careful exposure design to merge the various elements {{and give them}} a sense of apparently seamless action. Some scenes were filmed outdoors, in Méliès's garden in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, so that the camera could be <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>enough</b> <b>from</b> the Lilliputians to make them look small.|$|R
50|$|The Baker clamp {{introduces}} a nonlinear negative feedback into a common-emitter stage (BJT switch), {{with the purpose}} to avoid saturation by decreasing the gain near the saturation point. While the transistor is in active mode and it is <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>enough</b> <b>from</b> the saturation point, the negative feedback is turned off and the gain is maximal; when the transistor approaches the saturation point, the negative feedback gradually turns on, and the gain quickly drops. To decrease the gain, the transistor acts as a shunt regulator with regard to its own base-emitter junction: it diverts {{a part of the}} base current to ground by connecting a voltage-stable element in parallel to the base-emitter junction.|$|R
5|$|If the Moon {{were in a}} {{perfectly}} circular orbit, {{a little closer to}} the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. The Moon's orbit must cross Earth's ecliptic plane in order for an eclipse (both solar as well as lunar) to occur. In addition, the Moon's actual orbit is elliptical, often taking it <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Earth that its apparent size is not large enough to block the Sun entirely. The orbital planes cross each other at a line of nodes resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses occurring each year; no more than two of which can be total eclipses. However, total solar eclipses are rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on the Earth's surface traced by the Moon's shadow or umbra.|$|E
5|$|In late January {{into early}} February, the ITCZ {{produced}} areas of convection around {{the northern tip of}} Madagascar. One such convective system spawned a {{low pressure area}} between Tromelin island and Agaléga, which initially was still located within the ITCZ. On February5, the system developed into a tropical depression, and failed to intensify further while executing a clockwise loop off northeastern Madagascar. After the convection increased, the depression intensified into a tropical storm on February8 and was named Josie by the Meteorological Services of Madagascar. Subsequently, the storm moved across northern Madagascar and emerged into the Mozambique Channel on February9 as a tropical depression, its structure deteriorated. Josie turned to the southwest around western Madagascar, and despite warm waters it initially failed to re-intensify much. On February11, Josie re-attained tropical storm status, and subsequently turned to the south due to a broad area of low pressure in the region. The storm quickly intensified once moving <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Madagascar, becoming a tropical cyclone on February13 and soon after reaching peak 10winds of 140km/h (85mph); in contrast, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 165km/h (105mph). While near peak intensity, the eyewall of Josie passed over Europa Island. An approaching cold front turned the cyclone to the southeast, bringing the storm over cooler waters and causing weakening due to increased wind shear. On February16, Josie became extratropical well to the south of Madagascar, and dissipated the next day.|$|E

50|$|Hundreds {{of factors}} are {{involved}} in the lunitidal interval, especially near the shoreline. However, for those <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>enough</b> <b>from</b> the coast, the dominating consideration is the speed of gravity waves, which increases with the water's depth. (It is proportional to the square root of the depth, for the extremely long gravity waves that transport the water that is following the Moon around the Earth. The oceans are about 4 km deep and would have to be at least 22 km deep for these waves {{to keep up with the}} Moon. As mentioned above, a similar time lag accompanies the solar tides, a complicating factor that varies with the lunar phases.) By observing the age of leap tides, it becomes clear that the delay can actually exceed 24 hours in some locations.|$|R
50|$|Blue Beetle, {{last seen}} being {{captured}} by Lady Styx's henchmen, is also {{dropped into the}} competition, however, without his scarab armed. Caul later meets up with T'morra and Ember at a bar, where they inform Caul of Beetle's presence, because his residual Green Lantern energy might {{have an effect on}} Beetle's Reach armor. Captain K'rot with his team, Sleen and Pig-Iron, are trying to claim Beetle's Scarab. The Scarab activates to protect its unconscious host. During their altercation with Beetle, they run into Caul, which causes the Scarab to go berserk. Once Caul gets <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>enough</b> <b>from</b> Beetle, Jaime Reyes regains control and flies away. Star Hawkins and Ilda, a robot uploaded with the personality and memories of his deceased wife, arrive to cloak Caul and tell him the location of his Green Lantern power battery.|$|R
40|$|Going {{beyond a}} {{recently}} proposed microscopic model [1] for the incommensurate transition in the spin-Peierls TiOX (X=Cl, Br) compounds, {{in the present}} work we start by studying the thermodynamics of the model with XY spins and adiabatic phonons. We find that the system enters in an incommensurate phase by a first order transition at a low temperature Tc 1. At a higher temperature Tc 2 a continuous transition to a uniform phase is found. Furthermore, we study the magnetism in the incommensurate phase by Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) calculations on a 1 D Heisenberg model where the exchange is modulated by the incommensurate atomic position pattern. When the wave vector q of the modulation is near π, we find local magnetized zones (LMZ) in which spins abandon their singlets {{as a result of}} the domain walls induced by the modulated distortion. When q moves <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>enough</b> <b>from</b> π, the LMZ disappear and the system develops incommensurate magnetic correlations induced by the structure. We discuss the relevance of this result regarding previous and future experiments in TiOCl...|$|R

25|$|Lake Ontario's water {{temperature}} varies due to upwelling of colder water or warmer pools of surface water creating very localized thermal contrast; the deeper {{waters of the}} lake, far from the shore, remain at a near constant {{water temperature}} of , the effect of which is either cooling or warming (in winter). This creates generally warmer nights through the colder season. When offshore winds occur in summer, they warm as they blow toward the lakeshore in the evening; conversely, the cooling effect by the lake is most pronounced on spring afternoons, which affects Toronto even more than other cities on the Great Lakes as during spring onshore east to southeast winds are predominant, on some days, the temperatures can {{be as much as}} 10°C (18°F) cooler than areas located <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Lake Ontario, an effect that wanes by summer when the dominant windflow becomes more southwesterly.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} to this issue. One {{approach is to}} argue that all real forces drop off with distance from their sources in a known manner, so we have only {{to be sure that}} a body is <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> all sources to ensure that no force is present. A possible issue with this approach is the historically long-lived view that the distant universe might affect matters (Mach's principle). Another approach is to identify all real sources for real forces and account for them. A possible issue with this approach is that we might miss something, or account inappropriately for their influence, perhaps, again, due to Mach's principle and an incomplete understanding of the universe. A third approach {{is to look at the}} way the forces transform when we shift reference frames. Fictitious forces, those that arise due to the acceleration of a frame, disappear in inertial frames, and have complicated rules of transformation in general cases. On the basis of universality of physical law and the request for frames where the laws are most simply expressed, inertial frames are distinguished by the absence of such fictitious forces.|$|E

500|$|On July 8, 1758, Abercromby {{ordered a}} frontal {{attack against the}} hastily {{assembled}} French works. [...] Abercromby tried to move rapidly against the few French defenders, opting to forgo field cannon and relying instead on the numerical superiority of his 16,000 troops. In the Battle of Carillon, the British were soundly defeated by the 4,000 French defenders. [...] The battle took place <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the fort that its guns were rarely used. [...] The battle gave the fort a reputation for impregnability, which affected future military operations in the area, notably during the American Revolutionary War. Following the French victory, Montcalm, anticipating further British attacks, ordered additional work on the defenses, [...] including {{the construction of the}} Germain and Pontleroy redoubts (named for the engineers under whose direction they were constructed) to the northeast of the fort. [...] However, the British did not attack again in 1758, so the French withdrew all but a small garrison of men for the winter in November.|$|E
500|$|On September1, a {{tropical}} wave exited {{the west coast}} of Africa and quickly showed signs of organization. It possessed a low pressure area and some convection as the system moved generally westward. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first pinpointed the system as an area for potential development late on September2 while it was about [...] west-southwest of Cape Verde. However, an upper-level trough associated with the developing Hurricane Florence to its west increased wind shear across the region, which prevented significant tropical cyclone development over the next week. However, on September5, the NHC noted the potential for the storm system to organize into {{a tropical}} depression within the next several days, but its close proximity to Florence continued to stall its strengthening. By September9, the trough moved <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the system to allow wind shear to relent, signalling an increase in convective thunderstorm activity. At around 1800UTC that day, the system developed into a tropical depression about [...] east-northeast of the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
500|$|The most {{immediate}} {{threat to the}} Allies during the Phoney War period was the U-Boat. Some German submarines {{had been sent to}} sea before the British declaration of war and began operations against British shipping, bringing in vital supplies from North America and other areas of the British Empire, as soon as war was declared. In one notable action, [...] sank the battleship [...] at Scapa Flow in October 1939, with the loss of 786 crew. As a consequence the Admiralty pressed for the RAF's efforts to concentrate on RAF Coastal Command rather than a strategic striking force. This was heavily debated within the British establishment well into 1941. In keeping with a request from the United States of America to avoid the bombing of civilian targets, the British formulated the Western Air Plan 7B (WAP 7B), which planned for attacks on German warships. The Germans also complied with the American request, albeit only after 18 September 1939, when victory in Poland was assured. German ships were legitimate targets, and at sea or in port, were <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> civilian areas to avoid unnecessary casualties. The Plan revolved around their elimination to prevent their possible use as supplements to the U-boat fleet.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the other}} effects ILM had to produce were the {{transporter}} beam and the warp speed effect. Mullen {{noted that the}} effects' look changed depending on who was directing the film; [...] "everyone wants something distinctive, but nobody wants to get <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the TV series to startle the Trekkies." [...] The effect was produced by cutting out or rotomatting the individual to be transported, then making a vertical slot through which a high-intensity light was positioned. A computer-controlled move would cause the light to spread from the center and fade away, then reset its position and repeat the movement on the opposite side. Handmade acetate filters and gels were applied to give the transporter beam color and patterns, followed by small flickering animated highlights called [...] "bugs" [...] which appeared after the character had dematerialized. The Klingons' transporters were given a harsh red look to differentiate them from the smooth blue Federation effect. Whereas many of the multicolored rainbow warp trail shots from The Wrath of Khan were stock footage taken from the first film, the producers of the third film wanted something new. A streak effect, in which a beauty pass of the ship was combined with blurred passes for each light intensity, was tried first. The result was disappointing; as the Enterprise grew larger the streaks became distorted and out of place. Mullen rejected a straight animation of the warp drive as too bouncy, but the footage was cut in for editing while ILM went through six more approaches to the problem. The final effect, a [...] "vaporous, colorful trail", came together only weeks before the film's release.|$|E
