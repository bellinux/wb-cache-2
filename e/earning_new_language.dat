40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{building}} an initial phoneme model for training an HMM in a <b>new</b> <b>language</b> using an already trained recognition system in a base language. HMM based phoneme recognition systems are used to model the phonemes in most large vocabulary speech recognition tasks. Mappings between the phonetic spaces of the two languages are generated and are used to populate the phonetic space of the <b>new</b> <b>language.</b> The best possible alignment of the <b>new</b> <b>language</b> data is obtained and initial phone models are built on this labeled data. A classification experiment is performed in the <b>new</b> <b>language</b> to illustrate the goodness of initial phone models. Experiments are carried out with Hindi as the <b>new</b> <b>language</b> using an English language recognition system to derive the initial phone models for Hindi language. 1...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we develop}} a <b>new</b> <b>language</b> for genetic programming, {{specifically}} designed for high-level controller scripting on mobile robots. We then test this language against previous conventions on the Robots Everywhere Antbot platform. We develop a genetic programming framework using Python and the <b>new</b> <b>language,</b> to create corridor-following programs in a simple simulation. Using this framework, we conduct a variety of experiments to find good parameters and techniques that apply to this <b>new</b> <b>language,</b> which can evolve the best controllers. Our results suggest that hierarchical GP using a measure of elitism is likely the best solution, and that the <b>new</b> <b>language</b> is very capable of evolving solutions {{with a high degree}} of robustness and generality...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the addition of}} a <b>new</b> <b>language,</b> for which limited resources are available, to a phonotactic language identification system. Two classes of approaches are studied: in the first class, only existing phonetic recognizers are employed, whereas an additional phonetic recognizer in the <b>new</b> <b>language</b> is created for the second class. It is found that the number of acoustic recognizers employed plays a crucial role in determining the recognition accuracy for the <b>new</b> <b>language.</b> We study different approaches to incorporating a language for which audio-only data is available (no pronunciation dictionaries or transcriptions) and find that if more than about 2 000 training utterances are available, a bootstrapped acoustic model for the <b>new</b> <b>language</b> can improve accuracy substantially.

Once a <b>new</b> <b>language</b> was formed, the word 'Xigwamba' fell into disuse and a <b>new</b> <b>language,</b> Xitsonga replaced 'Xigwamba'.|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: Human beings' {{ability to}} {{communicate}} in mother tongue can be easily taken for granted until a situation arises when one uses another language. How should people go about acquiring the necessary skills for learning a <b>new</b> <b>language,</b> in this situation? Can learning a <b>new</b> <b>language</b> complement modern tertiary courses such as Business? This paper discusses why and how human beings learn a <b>new</b> <b>language.</b> It presents innovative methods of learning a <b>new</b> <b>language</b> using the latest technologies and teaching/learning ideas and approaches. The use of emerging technologies such as immersive Virtual Reality is discussed. A number of multimedia language learning environments, which encourage creativity and right brain functions are presented and analyzed. The author draws on his own experience of learning several languages, which includes various branches of the Indo-European group...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{study has}} {{explored}} the <b>New</b> <b>Language</b> Policy of South Africa, with special reference to African languages as possible media of instruction, at pre-tertiary level of education. The most critical and relevant linguistic aspects examined here, {{takes into account}} the issue of multilingualism in education or multilingual education (particularly the issues that still handicaps it), the development of African languages and linguistic rights. The study provides a brief overview with regard to individual and collective rights in South Africa. In sum, the South African government’s attempt to implement the <b>New</b> <b>Language</b> Policy, in part, has been carefully examined. The study has also investigated the relationship between the <b>New</b> <b>Language</b> policy and the people it directly affects. In this respect, much {{attention has been paid to}} the attitudes of teachers and students of the African community, that is, African-language speakers, toward the <b>New</b> <b>Language</b> policy. However, the legitimacy of the <b>New</b> <b>Language</b> policy amongst the Afrikaans-speaking populace is not explored in this study. It is anticipated that further research will he conducted in this respect. This study has further demonstrated how the government can be entrapped through the designing of its public policies. Sometimes governments fail to implement the policies they have formulated and announced to the public. The <b>New</b> <b>Language</b> policy of South Africa is no exception. This study indicates that although the <b>New</b> <b>Language</b> policy is politically correct, it is practically unworkable, complex, problematic and controversial with regard to African languages as media of instruction. Some recommendations are provided to shed other alternatives with regard to the successful implementation of the <b>New</b> <b>Language</b> policy. The study indicates that the South African Government should minimise its eleven media of instruction. Whilst one language (English) should serve as a medium of instruction in predominantly African or Black public schools, other languages (African languages) should be taught as subjects in the school curriculum...|$|R

This paper examines information extraction within a multilingual environment. The paper is in two parts; firstly the components of English information extraction are outlined. Then, these components are transferred to <b>new</b> <b>languages</b> and assembled into a multilingual information extraction framework. The components of information extraction can be induced into <b>new</b> <b>languages</b> through adaption of methods used for English language. In a multilingual environment different methods can be utilised to transfer linguistic knowledge across language barriers.
