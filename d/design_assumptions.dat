50|$|In {{order to}} appreciably reduce {{the mass of}} the oxygen carried at launch, a LACE vehicle needs to spend more time in the lower {{atmosphere}} to collect enough oxygen to supply the engines during the remainder of the launch. This leads to greatly increased vehicle heating and drag losses, which therefore increases fuel consumption to offset the drag losses and the additional mass of the thermal protection system. This increased fuel consumption offsets somewhat the savings in oxidizer mass; these losses are in turn offset by the higher specific impulse, I, of the air-breathing engine. Thus, the engineering trade-offs involved are quite complex, and highly sensitive to the <b>design</b> <b>assumptions</b> made.|$|E

50|$|It was a high-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane {{with the}} wing meeting the fuselage {{at the same}} position as the lower wing of the H.P.43 but without the inboard anhedral. The wing had a similar tapered planform to that of the H.P.47, though much bigger with a span of 90 ft rather than 58 ft. The H.P.47's wing construction used a single central spar forming the rear of a stressed skin torsion box forward to the leading edge and the confirmation of its <b>design</b> <b>assumptions</b> by stress tests at the RAE allowed a similar approach for the new aircraft. The H.P.51 wings were of thick RAF 34 section, and like the H.P.47 were fabric-covered behind the spar. There were leading edge slats on the outer half of the wing with fabric-covered ailerons and inboard slotted flaps on the trailing edge. The undercarriage legs of the H.P.51 were longer than those of the H.P.43 because there was no anhedral wing section: the main legs went vertically to the spar just behind the engine mounting and were each braced to the fuselage with a pair of struts from top and bottom of the leg. The resulting landing gear had a wide track, with legs in streamlined fairings and the wheels in spats.|$|E

5000|$|The {{building}} has been {{planned to use}} of all modern technical capacities: extended stage depth and proscenium, designed trapdoor and an external platform, which could lift the stage up to height meters. A panoramic scene portal was designed, with a fireproof front curtain, allowing, if necessary, an increased stage space. In this manner, the auditorium could be able function as a theatre scene and a conference stage. The auditorium itself has been designed {{on the model of}} a theatre of ancient Greece, without any partition between loges and balconies, so that the audience could feel closer to the artists. In 1973, building permits were issued and handed over to Budopol, the municipal firm in charge of the work. From 1973 to 1976, National Company [...] "Hydrobudowa 9" [...] from Poznan dug into the soil 1100 concrete piles. In the following years, <b>design</b> <b>assumptions</b> changed: from four intersecting rings, plans went down to two then eventually three. Issues to get building materials were recurrent and in 1977, at the time to secure the investment Polish Prime Minister Piotr Jaroszewicz canceled the project for economical reasons. However, local First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party in Bydgoszcz, Józef Majchrzak, decided to overrule Warsaw's decision by continuing the construction.Although works were expected to end in 1982, the economic crisis of the 1980s reduced severely state funds allocated for culture, interrupting the construction. Building became a symbol of [...] "eternal investments" [...] and few people believed in its completion. It is only in 1985, thanks to an increased effort of provincial administrative authorities and cultural lobbies, that the continuation of the construction was insured through the National Culture Development Fund. In 1986, former military warehouses and Headquarters Garrison were at last demolished, getting the work accelerated. Between 1990 and 1994, {{the main body of the}} edifice housing the auditorium and the main stage was glazed, and the work moved to dressing rooms and rehearsal rooms, all of which was carried out by a specialized Company, [...] "Teatr" [...] from Warsaw. With the end of communist era, the Fund for the Development of Culture was liquidated, putting another threat to postpone the completion of the building. Construction was then focusing on the third circle, planned to host offices (TVP3 Bydgoszcz), a convention center and restaurants. Around this date, initiative was taken to use the raw building to organize the first Bydgoszcz Opera Festival: main points were to draw attention of the public and decision makers on this important project and to raise funds for its achievement.|$|E
