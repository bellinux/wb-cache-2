40|$|Blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} important weeds in Europe. Because of the development and distribution of herbicide resistant populations the control of this weed has become a serious challenge in agriculture. In recent years a reduced efficacy of <b>fenoxaprop-P-ethyl</b> towards A. myosuroides has been observed. To investigate the degradation of the active substance <b>fenoxaprop-P-ethyl</b> in A. myosuroides, four populations were grown in the greenhouse: One herbicide sensitive population, two populations with a non-target-site resistance (NTSR) and one population with a target-site resistance (TSR). For dose response studies the plants were treated with different dosages of <b>fenoxaprop-P-ethyl</b> and dry weight was determined after three weeks. For the NTSR populations resistance factors of 76 and 2 could be calculated based on ED 50 values. The development of the TSR plants was not restricted by the herbicide treatment, not even with the highest dosage. For the degradation and metabolism studies plants were treated with <b>fenoxaprop-P-ethyl</b> and harvested for laboratory analysis 2, 8, 24, 48 and 96 hours after treatment.

Uncontrolled P. minor plants were selected for seed collection from wheat fields where <b>fenoxaprop-P-ethyl</b> was used to control P. minor. Seeds were collected from eight different locations near Fasialabad, Pakistan. Susceptible plants were also selected near Faisalabad having no history of fenoxaprop-P-ethyluse for comparison. These seeds were grown in pots for resistance confirmation using completely randomized design with factorial arrangement having four replicates. Four doses of fenoxaprop-P-ethylcontrol (0 X), 46. 9 (0. 5 X), 93. 7 (1 X) and 187 (2 X) g a. i. ha- 1 were sprayed at 3 to 4 leaf stage of P. minor. Three weeks after <b>fenoxaprop-P-ethyl</b> spray, percent mortality and biomass of different biotypes were recorded. Dose killing 50 % plants (LD 50) and resistance index (RI) were calculated {{on the basis of}} percent mortality. Results revealed that out of eight biotypes (PM-FS- 1, PM-FS- 2, PM-FS- 3, PM-FS- 4, PM-FS- 5, PM-FS- 6, PM-FS- 7 and PM-FS- 8) four biotypes (PM-FS- 1, PM-FS- 2, PM-FS- 6 and PM-FS- 7) showed resistance to <b>fenoxaprop-P-ethyl.</b> Percent mortality for the resistant biotypes was 51 to 71 % even at 2 X.

40|$|Herbicide {{resistance}} can {{be either}} target-site or non-target-site based. The molecular mechanisms underlying non-target-site resistance (NTSR) are poorly understood, especially {{at the level of}} gene expression regulation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent key post-transcriptional regulators of eukaryotic gene expression and play important roles in stress responses. In this study, the miR 397 gene from Beckmannia syzigachne (referred to as bsy-miR 397) was functionally characterized to determine its role in regulating <b>fenoxaprop-P-ethyl</b> resistance. We showed that (1) bsy-miR 397 transcript level is constitutively higher in resistant than in sensitive B. syzigachne plants, whereas bsy-Laccase expression and activity show the opposite trend, and (2) bsy-miR 397 suppresses the expression of bsy-Laccase in tobacco, indicating that it negatively regulates bsy-Laccase at the transcriptional level. We found evidences that miR 397 /laccase regulation might be involved in <b>fenoxaprop-P-ethyl</b> NTSR. First, the rice transgenic line overexpressing OXmiR 397 showed improved <b>fenoxaprop-P-ethyl</b> tolerance. Second, following activation of bsy-Laccase gene expression by CuSO 4 treatment, fenoxaprop resistance in B. syzigachne tended to decrease. Therefore, we suggest that bsy-miR 397 might play a role in <b>fenoxaprop-P-ethyl</b> NTSR in B. syzigachne by down-regulating laccase expression, potentially leading to the enhanced expression of three oxidases/peroxidases genes to introduce an active moiety into herbicide molecules in Phase- 2 metabolism. Bsy-miR 397, bsy-Laccase, and other regulatory components might form a regulatory network to detoxify <b>fenoxaprop-P-ethyl</b> in B. syzigachne, supported by the differential expression of transcription factors and oxidases/peroxidases in the rice transgenic line overexpressing OXmiR 397. This implies how down-regulation of a gene (laccase) can enhance NTSR. Our findings shed light on the daunting task of understanding and managing complex NTSR in weedy plant species...|$|E

40|$|Herbicide {{resistance}} in weeds {{is a major}} threat to agricultural productivity, but the incidence of herbicide {{resistance in}} agricultural systems continues to increase. It is increasingly recognised that sustainable weed management can only be achieved by considering the ecological and evolutionary drivers of herbicide resistance evolution. Within this context, {{it has been suggested that}} selection within pre-existing variation in herbicide susceptibility, underpinned by additive genetic variation, may result in rapid evolution of herbicide resistance. In this thesis, these principles were tested in the major agricultural weed Alopecurus myosuroides (black-grass). Dose-response experiments demonstrated pre-existing phenotypic variation in response to two commercial herbicides with alternative modes of action (the ACCase inhibitor herbicide <b>fenoxaprop-P-ethyl</b> and the ALS inhibitors mesosulfuron-methyl and iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium) in A. myosuroides with no history of exposure to herbicide. Selection within this pre-existing variation was then tested using low doses of the herbicide <b>fenoxaprop-P-ethyl,</b> demonstrating rapid increases in resistance following a single generation of selection. Recurrent selection showed further, but non-significant, increases in resistance. Competition experiments were then performed to compare fitness in the absence of herbicide between the original susceptible population, and a population following two generations of selection for <b>fenoxaprop-P-ethyl</b> resistance. Results suggested that both resistant and susceptible A. myosuroides populations were of similar fitness and competitiveness: seed output was highly variable, and both resistant and susceptible populations were highly competitive against wheat. Finally, the possibility of exploiting dose-dependent selection to limit resistance evolution was tested in a long-term dose rotation experiment using the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The results showed that rotating between a very high herbicide dose and no herbicide application could limit resistance evolution, but overall population control was poor. There were indications that rotation between intermediate higher and lower herbicide doses could successfully control population sizes and limit resistance evolution, but these effects were only present in the earlier stages of the experiment...|$|E

40|$|Attention {{should be}} devoted to weeds {{evolving}} herbicide resistance with non-target-site resistance (NTSR) mechanism due to their unpredictable resistance patterns. Quantification of fitness cost {{can be used in}} NTSR management strategies to determine the long-term fate of resistant plants in weed populations. To our knowledge, this is the first report evaluating potential fecundity and vegetative fitness of a NTSR black-grass (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds), the most important herbicide resistant weed in Europe, with controlled genetic background. The susceptible (S) and NTSR sub-populations were identified and isolated from a <b>fenoxaprop-P-ethyl</b> resistant population by a plant cloning technique. Using a target-neighborhood design, competitive responses of S and NTSR black-grass sub-populations to increasing density of winter wheat were quantified for 2 years in greenhouse and 1 year in field. Fitness traits including potential seed production, vegetative biomass and tiller number of both sub-populations significantly decreased with increasing density of winter wheat. More importantly, no statistically significant differences were found in fitness traits between S and NTSR sub-populations either grown alone (no competition) or in competition with winter wheat. According to the results, the NTSR black-grass is probably to persist in field even in the cessation of <b>fenoxaprop-P-ethyl.</b> So, effective herbicide resistant management strategies are strongly suggested to prevent and stop the spread of the NTSR black-grass, otherwise NTSR loci conferring resistance to a range of herbicides in black-grass will persist in the gene pool {{even in the absence of}} herbicide application. Consequently, herbicide as an effective tool for control of black-grass will gradually be lost in fields infested by NTSR black-grass...|$|E

The {{experiments were}} laid out in split plot design replicated thrice. In the experimental field, grasses were found to be dominant followed by broad leaved weeds and sedges. Among different methods of sowing, dibbling the seeds three days after pre-sowing application of paraquat @ 0. 5 kg ha- 1 recorded significantly lower values of total weed density, total weed dry matter production and weed index in both years of study and hence better growth and reproductive parameters were obtained under the same treatment. Application of fenoxaprop-pethyl @ 75 g ha- 1 or cyhalofop butyl @ 100 g ha- 1 on 15 DAS significantly reduced the density and dry weight of dominant grassy weeds over the other treatments and increased the yield of rice fallow black gram.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the relative importance of glutathione S-transferase (GST) mediated herbicide and fungicide detoxification in wheat plants and to functionally characterise GSTs cloned from phytopathogenic fungi. Wheat seedlings treated with and without safeners were used for in vivo and in vitro pesticide metabolism studies with the herbicide <b>fenoxaprop-P-ethyl</b> and the fungicide fluquinconazole, which are both known to undergo glutathione conjugation. <b>Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl</b> underwent rapid detoxification by this route and the rates of metabolism were enhanced in safener treated wheat. In contrast, fluquinconazole was poorly metabolised with only a small proportion detoxified by glutathlonylation irrespective {{of whether or not the}} plants were safener treated. Subsequent studies confirmed that whereas fenoxaprop was a substrate for wheat GSTs, fluquinconazole was not. Similarly, when a diverse range of systemic and contact fungicides was tested, none were found to undergo conjugation mediated by wheat GSTs, even though several compounds underwent conjugation with glutathione in alkaline conditions. Metabolite profiling by HPLC-MS established that the alternative thiol present in wheat, hydroxymethyl glutathione, was used in addition to glutathione in fenoxaprop detoxification. The S-conjugates were then further metabolised by peptidases and glucosyl- and malonyl transferases to yield polar derivatives such as the cysteinyl-malonyl-glucosyl derivative. This rapid processing was in contrast to that determined in herbicide-susceptible and herbicide-resistant black-grass, where the glutathione derivative was the major metabolite of fenoxaprop. Using an informatics approach, GSTs in IVIagnaporthe griseae and Phytoptithora infestans were identified cloned and then expressed in E. coli, with the pure enzymes assayed for glutathione-dependent activities. MgGSTX 1 of Magnaporthe griseae was found to be a member of a novel class of GSTs (termed xi class) and was shown to function as a thioltransferase, with a specific activity of 50. 4 ± 3. 4 nKat mg (^- 1) protein. Unusually, the catalytic mechanism of thiol transfer was insensitive to the alkylating agent iodoacetamide, indicating that free cysteines were not involved in catalysis. MgGSTX 1 did not conjugate any of the experimental xenobiotics tested with GSH. The theta class GST P/GSTT 1 cloned from P. infestans exhibited glutathione peroxidase activity and readily detoxified fungitoxic oxylipins produced by potato as antimicrobial defence by potato through the action of lipoxygenases. Using anti-sera raised against the purified recombinant protein, immunoblotting experiments revealed expression of P/GSTT 1 in the in vitro cultured fungus as well as during colonisation of potato. P/GSTT 1 did not demonstrate GSH conjugating toward any of the xenobiotic substrates tested including herbicides and fungicides.
