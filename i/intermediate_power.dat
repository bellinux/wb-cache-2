25|$|The Winchester Model 1907 is a blowback-operated, {{semi-automatic}} rifle {{produced by the}} Winchester Repeating Arms Company beginning in 1906 with production ending in 1958. It fired a cartridge of <b>intermediate</b> <b>power</b> (roughly equivalent in energy to the 7.62x39), cycled through a semi-automatic operating mechanism, fed by a detachable magazine. It was fed from a 5, 10, or 15 round detachable box magazine located immediately forward of the trigger guard. In size and handling, it is much like an M1 carbine, though the 1907 is heavier and fires a much harder hitting round.|$|E
60|$|The civil disabilities, for {{the removal}} of which Mr. O'Connell and his {{followers}} are braving the Government, cannot but be indifferent to the great body of the Irish nation, except as means for gaining an end. Take away the <b>intermediate</b> <b>power</b> of the priests, and an insurrection in Brobdignag at the call of the King of Lilliput might be as hopefully expected as that the Irish people would stir as they are now prepared to do at the call of a political demagogue. Now these civil disabilities do not directly affect the priests; they therefore must have ulterior views, and though it must be flattering to their vanity to shew that they have the Irish representation in their own hands, and though their worldly interest and that of their connections will, they know, immediately profit by that dominion, what they look for principally is the advancement of their religion at the cost of Protestantism; that would bring everything else in its train. While {{it is obvious that the}} political agitators could not rouse the people without the intervention of the priests, it is true that the priests could not excite the people without a hope that from the exaltation of their Church their social condition would be improved. What in Irish interpretation these words would mean we may tremble to think of.|$|E
6000|$|This conclusion, then, {{we arrive}} at, must arrive at; the fact being irrevocably so:--that {{in order to}} give your {{imagination}} and the other powers of your souls full play, you must do as all the great architects of old time did--you must yourselves be your sculptors. Phidias, Michael Angelo, Orcagna, Pisano, Giotto,--which of these men, do you think, could not use his chisel? You say, [...] "It is difficult; quite out of your way." [...] I know it is; nothing that is great is easy; and nothing that is great, so long as you study building without sculpture, can be in your way. I want to put it in your way, and you to find your way to it. But, on the other hand, do not shrink from the task as if the refined art of perfect sculpture were always required from you. For, though architecture and sculpture are not separate arts, there is an architectural manner of sculpture; and it is, in the majority of its applications, a comparatively easy one. Our great mistake at present, in dealing with stone at all, is requiring to have all our work too refined; it is just the same mistake as if we were to require all our book illustrations to be as fine work as Raphael's. John Leech does not sketch so well as Leonardo da Vinci; but {{do you think that the}} public could easily spare him; or that he is wrong in bringing out his talent in the way in which it is most effective? Would you advise him, if he asked your advice, to give up his wood-blocks and take to canvas? I know you would not; neither would you tell him, I believe, on the other hand, that because he could not draw as well as Leonardo, therefore he ought to draw nothing but straight lines with a ruler, and circles with compasses, and no figure- subjects at all. That would be some loss to you; would it not? You would all be vexed if next week's Punch had nothing in it but proportionate lines. And yet, do not you see that you are doing precisely the same thing with your powers of sculptural design that he would be doing with his powers of pictorial design, if he gave you nothing but such lines. You feel that you cannot carve like Phidias; therefore you will not carve at all, but only draw mouldings; and thus all that <b>intermediate</b> <b>power</b> which is of especial value in modern days,--that popular power of expression which is within the attainment of thousands,--and would address itself to tens of thousands,--is utterly lost to us in stone, though in ink and paper it has become one of the most desired luxuries of modern civilization.|$|E

25|$|The {{control system}} is complex {{due to the}} sheer size of the {{aircraft}} and the need to compensate for aeroelastic deformation of the structure, as well as the very large friction loads of the control rods, levers etc. To keep control forces felt by the pilots to a minimum, the control system is in three distinct phases. Phase one is direct mechanical control from pilot inputs which is fed into phase two. Phase two is the <b>intermediate</b> <b>powered</b> control system with low-powered hydraulic boosters transferring commands to the third phase. Phase three is the high-powered rapid action control actuators at the main gearboxes operating the swashplates directly.|$|R
40|$|Giant optical Faraday {{rotation}} (GFR) {{and giant}} optical circular birefringence (GCB) induced {{by a single}} quantum-dot spin in an optical microcavity {{can be regarded as}} linear effects in the weak-excitation approximation if the input field lies in the low-power limit [Hu et al, Phys. Rev. B 78, 085307 (2008) and ibid 80, 205326 (2009) ]. In this work, we investigate the transition from the weak-excitation approximation moving into the saturation regime comparing a semiclassical approximation with the numerical results from a quantum optics toolbox [S. M. Tan, J. Opt. B 1, 424 (1999) ]. We find that the GFR and GCB around the cavity resonance in the strong coupling regime are input-field independent at <b>intermediate</b> <b>powers</b> and can be well described by the semiclassical approximation. Those associated with the dressed state resonances in the strong coupling regime or merging with the cavity resonance in the Purcell regime are sensitive to input field at <b>intermediate</b> <b>powers,</b> and cannot be well described by the semiclassical approximation due to the quantum dot saturation. As the GFR and GCB around the cavity resonance are relatively immune to the saturation effects, the rapid read out of single electron spins can be carried out with coherent state and other statistically fluctuating light fields. This also shows that high speed quantum entangling gates, robust against input power variations, can be built exploiting these linear effects. Comment: Section IV has been added to show the linear GFR/GCB is not affected by high-order dressed state resonances in reflection/transmission spectra. 11 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
