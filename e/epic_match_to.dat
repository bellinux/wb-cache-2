25|$|The {{first major}} open tournament was the 1968 French Open, when Gonzales {{had just turned}} 40. In {{spite of the fact}} that he had been semi-retired for a number of years and that the tournament was held on slow clay courts that penalize serve-and-volley players, Gonzales beat the 1967 {{defending}} champion Roy Emerson in the quarterfinals. He then lost in the semifinals to Rod Laver. He lost in the third round of 1968 Wimbledon but later beat the second-seeded Tony Roche in the fourth round of the 1968 US Open, before losing an <b>epic</b> <b>match</b> <b>to</b> the Netherlands' Tom Okker.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, Beth Herr lost an <b>epic</b> <b>match</b> <b>to</b> Billie Jean King at Wimbledon 8-6 in the 3rd. Commentators on HBO Breakfast at Wimbledon made a {{very big}} deal out of her ability to hit {{numerous}} swinging volleys out of the air for winners. This was something that had not been done before especially by a female.|$|E
50|$|In February, Karlović {{reached the}} final of the U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships, losing to Kei Nishikori. In May, he reached {{the final of}} the Düsseldorf Open, losing to Philipp Kohlschreiber.

50|$|In the 1962-63 season Saints fielded {{the same}} line-up in 28 matches {{including}} all seven FA Cup matches as Saints progressed to the semi-final, going out 1-0 at Villa Park to eventual winners Manchester United, after an <b>epic</b> three <b>match</b> battle <b>to</b> get past Nottingham Forest {{in the previous}} round. In the first quarter-final replay against Forest, Burnside scored an 89th-minute equaliser as Saints {{came back from a}} three-goal deficit. In the second replay, at White Hart Lane he scored twice, including a rocket shot for the third goal as Saints finally defeated Forest 5-0.|$|R
50|$|Patti LaBelle {{embarked}} on a solo career in 1977, shortly after the split of the adventurous girl group Labelle. Her first solo album, a self-titled affair, was critically acclaimed and also found commercial success. However, her three follow-ups for <b>Epic,</b> failed <b>to</b> <b>match</b> that album's momentum, despite some charted singles. When her fourth album, Released, failed to generate a significant R&B or pop hit, she agreed to sign with Philadelphia International Records, which had been known to provide hits for veteran artists such as The O'Jays, Lou Rawls and Billy Paul.|$|R
50|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} Romantic tradition, in {{reaction}} to the spirit of the Enlightenment, folklorists collected folktales, epic poems, and ballads, and brought them out in printed form. The Brothers Grimm were inspired in their collection, Grimm's Fairy Tales, by the movement of German Romanticism. Many other collectors were inspired by the Grimms and the similar sentiments. Frequently their motives stemmed not merely from Romanticism, but from Romantic nationalism, in that many were inspired to save their own country's folklore: sometimes, as in the Kalevala, they compiled existing folklore into an <b>epic</b> <b>to</b> <b>match</b> other nation's; sometimes, as in Ossian, they fabricated folklore that should have been there. These works, whether fairy tale, ballads, or folk epics, were a major source for later fantasy works.|$|R

25|$|Agassi opened 2001 by {{successfully}} {{defending his}} Australian Open title with a straight-sets final win over Arnaud Clément.

40|$|This revised chart {{contains}} a summary {{list of the}} 1167 sets of duplicate line repetitions in the Iliad and Odyssey of Homer {{that are based on}} an initial appearance in the Iliad. The data is derived from my computerized analysis of text and lemmatization information contained in xml files downloaded from the WordHoard (Chicago Homer) website. My associated paper 2 ̆ 2 Homeric Epic Repeated Lines Chart 3 : All Iliad Repeated Lines 2 ̆ 2 has the same information, but sorted by the 2575 actual repetitions that appear in the Iliad. I have also posted a similar pair of papers cataloging repetitions within the Odyssey.

50|$|Trinity {{defeated}} their arch-rivals Castleford by 29-17 at Belle Vue on Saturday 16 September 2006 {{to preserve}} their Super League status in an <b>epic</b> <b>match</b> which saw both teams leading for spells of the game.

The match was attended by a sell out crowd of 11,000.|$|R
50|$|The {{match was}} set for May 15, 1845, again at the Union Course. It was the last <b>epic</b> <b>match</b> race held at that location. The crowd {{estimate}} was a possible 100,000 people. Fashion was the slight favorite. The biggest betting was not on who might win, but on the time the race would be run in. By the day of Peytona's winning race, only four horses showed up, Peytona won a huge stake, and the organizer lost money.|$|R
50|$|Part is {{generally}} regarded to {{have failed to}} consolidate his early success {{for most of the}} 1990s. Despite more wins on the North American circuit, including the Canadian Open and Canadian National Championships in 1995, Part struggled to make an impact in the major tournaments in the United Kingdom after his 1994 BDO World Championship success at Lakeside. In the 1995 BDO World Championship, Part only won one match in defending his title; losing an <b>epic</b> <b>match</b> in the second round to Paul Williams. Part and Williams had another <b>epic</b> <b>match</b> {{in the first round of}} the 1996 BDO World Championship, this time with Part winning, but Part was unable to make it to the quarter-finals of the BDO World Championship again after 1994, while Part also failed to reach the quarter finals of the World Masters during his entire BDO career. Despite his initial whirlwind success, Part was struggling to reach the heady heights of his breakthrough win. In June 1997, Part left the British Darts Organisation and joined the rival Professional Darts Corporation, and has competed in PDC sanctioned events ever since then.|$|R
