It is for the most part residential; on the northern side stands the Belvedere Court block of flats. Built with the road in the 1930s, the building is now Grade II Listed as an example of 1930s architecture.|$|E
5|$|The hamlet was {{designed}} by John Nash, master of the Picturesque style. He had worked for Harford on other buildings. The hamlet is the first fully realised exemplar of the <b>garden</b> <b>suburb</b> and was the inspiration for virtually all garden suburbs that followed. The cottages are all unique and include brick chimneys and dormer windows with some having thatched roofs. They are examples of the picturesque, an aesthetic ideal introduced into English cultural debate in 1782 by William Gilpin. An oval path links the cottages and encircles the village green, which has a sundial at its centre. The cottage gardens are planted in a Victorian cottage garden style.|$|E

5|$|After passing {{playing fields}} to the south, the A1 briefly becomes Market Place, a former street market that {{has evolved into}} a short stretch of shops, then becomes Falloden Way – built between 1914 and 1924 as part of a {{programme}} of planned extensions to Hampstead <b>Garden</b> <b>Suburb,</b> and runs on an embankment due to a dip in the ground caused by Mutton Brook, a tributary of the River Brent, which runs parallel to the road immediately to the south for its entire length. The north side of the road is occupied by 1930s housing blocks, whilst the southern side is occupied by a narrow strip of parkland following the brook, and by the northern tip of Big Wood and Little Wood – two of the few surviving remnants of the ancient woodland that once covered what is now north London.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} garden cities {{is to produce}} {{relatively}} economically independent cities with short commute times and {{the preservation of the}} countryside. <b>Garden</b> <b>suburbs</b> arguably do the opposite. <b>Garden</b> <b>suburbs</b> are built on the outskirts of large cities with no sections of industry. They are therefore dependent on reliable transport allowing workers to commute into the city. Lewis Mumford, one of Howard's disciples explained the difference as [...] "The Garden City, as Howard defined it, is not a suburb but the antithesis of a suburb: not a rural retreat, but a more integrated foundation for an effective urban life." ...|$|R

25|$|Suburbanisation in the interwar {{period was}} heavily {{influenced}} by the garden city movement of Ebenezer Howard and the creation of the first garden suburbs {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. The first <b>garden</b> <b>suburb</b> was developed through the efforts of social reformer Henrietta Barnett and her husband; inspired by Ebenezer Howard and the model housing development movement (then exemplified by Letchworth garden city), as well as the desire to protect part of Hampstead Heath from development, they established trusts in 1904 which bought 243 acres of land along the newly opened Northern line extension to Golders Green and created the Hampstead <b>Garden</b> <b>Suburb.</b> The suburb attracted the talents of architects including Raymond Unwin and Sir Edwin Lutyens, and it ultimately grew to encompass over 800 acres.|$|E
25|$|The {{principles}} of the garden city were soon applied to the planning of city suburbs. The first such project was the Hampstead <b>Garden</b> <b>Suburb</b> founded by Henrietta Barnett and planned by Parker and Unwin. The scheme's utopian ideals were {{that it should be}} open to all classes of people with free access to woods and gardens and that the housing should be of low density with wide, tree-lined roads.|$|E

Through a gradual process of selling off former manors, houses were built radiating from the town in all directions for about a mile. More significant growth occurred between 1910 and 1911 with the construction of Gidea Park <b>Garden</b> <b>Suburb,</b> which included Raphael Park and Gidea Park railway station.

500|$|Upminster is a {{suburban}} town in east London, England, {{and part of}} the London Borough of Havering.
