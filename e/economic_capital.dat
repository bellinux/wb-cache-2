25|$|The {{degree to}} which social origin affects these {{preferences}} surpasses both educational and <b>economic</b> <b>capital.</b> Demonstrably, at equivalent levels of educational capital, social origin remains an influential factor in determining these dispositions. How one describes one’s social environment relates closely to social origin because the instinctive narrative springs from early stages of development. Also, across the divisions of labor, “economic constraints tend to relax without any {{fundamental change in the}} pattern of spending.” This observation reinforces the idea that social origin, more than <b>economic</b> <b>capital,</b> produces aesthetic preferences because regardless of economic capability, consumption patterns remain stable.|$|E

The greatest social role of institutionalized cultural-capital is {{in the labor market}} (a job), wherein it allows the expression of the person's array of cultural capital as qualitative and quantitative measurements (which are compared against the measures of cultural capital of other people). The institutional recognition facilitates the conversion of cultural capital into <b>economic</b> <b>capital,</b> by serving as a heuristic (practical solution) with which the seller can describe his or her cultural capital to the buyer.|$|E
25|$|The act of {{domestic}} violence towards women is a human rights violation {{as well as an}} illegal act under Indian law.

In the 1789 replacement of the historic provinces of France, Brittany was divided among five départements. The administrative region of Brittany did not exist during the 19th and early 20th centuries, although its cultural heritage remained. Nantes and Rennes are in Upper Brittany (the Romance-speaking part of the region), and Lower Brittany in the west is traditionally Breton-speaking and more Celtic in culture. As a large port whose outskirts encompassed other provinces, Nantes has been Brittany's <b>economic</b> <b>capital</b> and a cultural crossroads.

25|$|Social philosopher Jürgen Habermas {{disagrees with}} Luhmann {{and argues that}} the law {{can do a better}} job as a 'system' institution' by {{representing}} more faithfully the interests of everyday people in the 'lifeworld'. Yet another sociological theory of law and lawyers is that of Pierre Bourdieu and his followers, who see law as a social field in which actors struggle for cultural, symbolic and <b>economic</b> <b>capital</b> and in so doing develop the reproductive professional habitus of the lawyer. In several continental European countries empirical research in sociology of law developed strongly from the 1960s and 1970s. In Poland the work of Adam Podgórecki and his associates (often influenced by Petrazycki's ideas) was especially notable; in Sweden empirical research in sociology of law in this period was pioneered especially by Per Stjernquist, and in Norway by Vilhelm Aubert.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we develop}} {{indicators}} of vulnerability in employment in seven <b>economic</b> <b>capitals</b> of West Africa (Abidjan, Bamako, Cotonou, Dakar, Lome, Niamey, and Ouagadougou) and study their links with individual incomes {{from the main}} job. We draw on data from the 1 - 2 - 3 Surveys in 2002 - 2003 to make a cross-country comparison using rigorously the same variables and methodology for each country. The theory of compensating differentials states that workers may receive pecuniary compensation commensurate with the strenuous or hazardous nature of their tasks or adverse working conditions. Our interpretation {{of the link between}} employment status and incomes draws on these developments, applying them to both working conditions themselves and more broadly to vulnerability in employment. The main tested assumption is that high levels of employment vulnerability could be compensated by greater earnings. Following recent work by Fernandez and Nordman (2009), we allow for individual and job characteristics (the latter being used to construct the composite index of vulnerability) to be differentially valued for conditionally high and low income earners. Our composite index of employment vulnerability indicates that 85 % of the private sector workers in all the <b>economic</b> <b>capitals</b> studied are vulnerable on the basis of at least one criterion. The results show that the average impact of vulnerability on earnings is generally negative for an average level of vulnerability. In the formal private sector of the West African cities, losses of income due to vulnerability are lower for high levels of vulnerability, bu...|$|R

The newly founded Kingdom of Valencia was granted wide self-government under the Crown of Aragon. Valencia experienced its golden age in the 15th century, as it became the Crown's <b>economic</b> <b>capital</b> and contributed with the most important works of Catalan medieval literature.

Even though Tenerife's economy is highly {{specialized}} in the service sector, which makes 78 percent of its total production capacity, {{the importance of the}} rest of the economic sectors is key to its production development. In this sense, the primary sector, which only represents 1.98 percent of the total product, groups activities that are important to the sustainable development of the island's economy. The energy sector which contributes 2.85 percent has a primary role in the development of renewable energy sources. The industrial sector which shares in 5.80 percent is a growing activity in the island, vis-a-vis the new possibilities created by technological advances. Finally, the construction sector with 11.29 percent of the total production has a strategic priority, because it is a sector with relative stability which permits multiple possibilities of development and employment opportunities.|$|E
25|$|With {{the return}} of the Austrians in 1815, the city {{completed}} its cultural and economic success. Commercial and financial activities made Milan Italy's main business centre. Furthermore, thanks to the completion of many irrigation projects coordinated by the government, Milanese agriculture was among the most modern and best developed in Europe. At the same time, the city became the largest publishing and cultural centre of Italy with the involvement of figures including Carlo Cattaneo, Cesare Cantù and Carlo Tenca. Milan developed Neoclassical works in both the private and public domains: firstly {{as a result of the}} strong link between the Enlightenment and Neoclassical art, especially publicly funded architecture, and secondly the role that architecture played in celebrating the Neoclassical revolution and Napoleon's exploits. They inevitably came to an end with the Restoration. Neoclassicism began a slow decline, passing through periods of Romanticism and Eclecticism, but nevertheless leaving a great legacy. Indeed, during this flourishing period, the foundations were laid for Milan later to become the <b>economic</b> <b>capital</b> and, in certain periods, also the cultural capital of a united Italy.|$|E
