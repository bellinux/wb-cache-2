40|$|SR 33557 (<b>fantofarone)</b> and SR 33805 are {{structurally}} novel cal-cium antagonists {{that bind}} selectively to the al-subunit of the L-type Ca channel {{at a site}} distinct from the classical 1, 4 -dihydropyndine, phenylalkylamine and benzothiazepine sites but in allostenc interactions with them. Blocking effects of <b>fantofarone</b> and SR 33805 on {{the different types of}} voltage-activated Ca currents have been investigated with the whole-cell patch-clamp method in chick dorsal root ganglion neurons (for T-, L- and N-type currents) and in rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons (for P-type current) in primary culture. Neuro-nal L-type Ca channels are blocked totaily by <b>fantofarone</b> and 5 R 33805 in the tM range of concentration as in skeletal muscle and cardiac cells at a holding membrane potential of- 80 mV. The sequence of efficacy is SR 33805 (IC = 26 nM) > <b>fantofarone</b> (lC = 0. 35 pM). N- and P-type channels are not very sensitive to fanto-farone and SR 33805 (lC 5 MM). Th...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of SR 33805, a <b>fantofarone</b> derivative with reported strong Ca 2 + -antagonistic properties, on the contractile properties of intact and skinned rat ventricular myocytes. On intact cells loaded with the Ca 2 +-fluorescent indicator Indo- 1, the application of low concentrations of SR 33805 enhanced the amplitude of unloaded cell shortening and decreased the duration of cell shortening. Amplitude of the Ca 2 + transient was also decreased. These effects were accompanied with a shortening of the action potential and a dose-dependent blockade of L-type calcium current (IC 50 = 2. 4 × 10 − 8 M). On skinned cardiac cells, the application of a low SR 33805 concentration (10 − 8 M) induced a significant increase in maximal Ca 2 +-activated force at the two-tested sarcomere lengths (SLs), 1. 9 and 2. 3 μm. The application of a larger dose of SR 33805 (10 − 6 – 10 − 5 M) induced a significant leftward shift of the tension–pCa relation that accounts for Ca 2 +-sensitization of the myofilaments, particularly at 2. 3 μm SL. In conclusion, despite its strong Ca 2 +-antagonistic properties SR 33805 increases cardiac cell contractile activity as a consequence of its Ca 2 +-sensitizing effects. These effects are attributable to both an increase in the maximal Ca 2 +-activated force and a length-dependent Ca 2 +-sensitization...|$|E
40|$|Neutrophils rapidly undergo {{spontaneous}} apoptosis {{following their}} {{release from the}} bone marrow. Although central to leukocyte homeostasis, the mechanisms that regulate neutrophil apoptosis remain poorly understood. We show here that apoptosis of cultured neutrophils is preceded by {{a substantial increase in}} the intracellular levels of 16 and 24 carbon atom (C(16) - and C(24)) -ceramides, which are lipid second messengers of apoptosis and stress signaling. Treatment of neutrophils with fumonisin B(2), a selective inhibitor of the de novo pathway of ceramide synthesis, prevented accumulation of C(16) - and C(24) -ceramides. Moreover, fumonisin B(2) significantly reduced caspase- 3, - 8, and - 9 activation and apoptosis in these cells. Conversely, 3 -O-methylsphingomyelin and <b>fantofarone,</b> which are specific inhibitors of neutral and acid sphingomyelinases, respectively, neither inhibited C(16) - and C(24) -ceramide production nor decreased the apoptosis rate in neutrophils, indicating that in these cells, ceramides are not generated from membrane sphingomyelin. Further experiments showed that increasing endogenous C(16) - and C(24) -ceramide levels by using DL-threo- 1 -phenyl- 2 -palmitoylamino- 3 -morpholino- 1 -propanol and (1 S, 2 R) -D-erythro- 2 -(N-myristoylamino) - 1 -phenyl- 1 -propanol, two inhibitors of ceramide metabolism, enhances caspase- 3, - 8, and - 9 activity and increases neutrophil apoptosis. Similarly, apoptosis was induced rapidly when synthetic C(16) - and/or C(24) -ceramides were added to neutrophil cultures. Finally, GM-CSF, a cytokine that delays neutrophil apoptosis, abrogated C(16) - and C(24) -ceramide accumulation totally in cultured neutrophils, whereas Fas ligation accelerated apoptosis in these cells without affecting de novo ceramide production. We conclude that de novo generation of C(16) - and C(24) -ceramides contributes to spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis via caspase activation and that GM-CSF exerts its antiapoptotic effects on neutrophils, at least partly through inhibition of ceramide accumulation.
