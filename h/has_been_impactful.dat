40|$|M. Com. (Financial Management) Over {{the last}} three decades, {{socially}} responsible investing (SRI) has {{emerged as one of}} the foremost issues faced by individuals and institutions in their daily activities. While the roots of responsible investing date back to the 18 th century, the recent focus on responsible investing <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>impactful.</b> There has been growth in understanding the impact of investors’ decisions on long-term sustainability of business and society. In South Africa, the recent amendment of Regulation 28 of Pension Funds Act of 1956 and the introduction of the Code for Responsible Investing in South Africa (CRISA) are some of the latest developments in support of SRI. This minor dissertation evaluates the performance of SRI funds relative to traditional funds from January 2006 to June 2011. Specifically, the focus is on four main measures. Firstly, SRI funds relative to SRI funds’ own mandated benchmark; secondly, SRI funds relative to proxy market benchmark indices; thirdly, SRI funds relative to a matched sample of traditional unit trust funds; and lastly, SRI indices relative to traditional market indices. Twenty-seven funds were analysed in the study. The first finding was that SRI funds outperform their respective benchmarks on an unadjusted basis. Secondly, SRI funds showed slightly better risk-adjusted performance compared to proxy benchmark indices. Thirdly, SRI funds underperformed against a matched sample of traditional peers. Lastly, the FTSE/JSE SRI Equity Index underperformed against the general market equity index, but outperformed both the bonds and money market indices...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Childhood {{obesity is}} a {{significant}} health concern, especially in lower income African Americans within the United States. Previous research suggests that programs developed to promote healthy eating and exercise habits have been effective in reducing childhood obesity. One strategy that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>impactful</b> in facilitating those changes is Motivational Interviewing (MI), a brief, patient-centered counseling style used to explore and resolve ambivalence about behavior change. Recent {{studies have shown that}} MI has its advantages, such as increasing patients’ sense of control when making healthy choices and promoting overall wellness; however, less research examines treatment fidelity and its impact on program adherence which may limit the interpretation of the results. Treatment fidelity is defined as the methodological strategies used to monitor and enhance {{the reliability and validity of}} behavioral intervention. NOURISH+ is a parent-focused intervention for overweight children ages 5 - 11 years (Nourishing Our Understanding of Role-Modeling to Increase Support and Health: PI: Mazzeo). We are currently implementing an adjunctive, MI-based treatment to investigate if MI can improve treatment adherence and effectiveness of NOURISH+ (NOURISH+MI; PI: Bean). We describe treatment fidelity methods and preliminary feasibility data in the NOURISH+MI trial. Methods: Prior to study onset, raters were trained extensively on use of the MITI 3. 1 (Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity Code), a validated coding system designed to measure adherence to MI. Satisfactory interrater reliabilities (determined using intraclass correlations; [ICC]) were established prior to study onset. Raters also used the MITI 3. 1 to examine MI competency of study interventionists, to indicate readiness to begin treatment. Participants who consent to NOURISH+MI complete two MI sessions prior to the onset of the group-based treatment. Session 1 (T 1) occurs over the telephone and Session 2 (T 2) is in-person. All sessions are audio recorded and independently coded by two raters. ICCs are continually assessed throughout the study duration to identify rater drift and indicate areas in need of retraining. MITI ratings also determine interventionists’ competence and adherence to MI. Raters and interventionists attend bi-weekly to address. Results: To date, 80 MI sessions (T 1 = 46, T 2 = 34) have been conducted and coded using the MITI for MI adherence. Interventionists met or exceeded competency with a M of 100 % MI adherence, 1. 8 reflection to question ratio, and 4. 8 Global spirit. Rater ICC’s ranged from 0. 6 to 1. 0 across MI global scores and behavior counts. Discussion: Interventionists met or exceeded competency thresholds, demonstrating excellent treatment fidelity. While overall ICCs were adequate, the limited response ranges for the global scores contributed to lower ICCs in those domains. Overall reliabilities were adequate suggesting high fidelity to the MITI 3. 1 and reliable ratings among independent raters. Data suggest that the NOURISH+MI trial is being implemented with high treatment integrity. Thus, if study results suggest that MI is deemed effective, this intense protocol for establishing and maintaining treatment fidelity enhances confidence in treatment effects and furthers scientific research examining MI and pediatric obesity treatments.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{an unusual}} type of ‘cultural theme park’, {{one that is}} not based on simulating existing cultural diversity or historical places, but based in some senses on a ‘double simulation’. The theme park is based on an historical painting assumed to represent the North Song Dynasty period in Kaifeng, China; however, it is a representation that historians argue may never have existed. Utilising on-site interviews and participant observation, this paper traces the connections between the classic painting (清明上河图) and the actual historical landscape of Bianjing (the first simulation), and in so doing, unravels the links between the painting and the theme park (the second simulation) and the simulacra that are envisioned to form within the spaces of the theme park {{as a result of the}} interplay of simulations during theme park visits. The simulations and intended simulacra are ‘consumed’ to various degrees, suggesting that the representations of Kaifeng's historical past and culture <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>impactful</b> and (in) authenticity <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> an issue. Moreover, the theme park has served to entertain and, in some cases, inspire through playful appropriations of Kaifeng's past and culture. The resultant simulacra and its double simulations (in simulating both the real Bianjing and the neo-real landscape painting) contrast and simultaneously connect with rampant replications of the Occident in contemporary Chinese residential landscapes, townships and themed spaces...|$|R

30|$|Despite making {{efforts in}} {{promoting}} and explaining {{the benefits of}} a less structured and academically focused curriculum by the preschool educators, parental demands for a more structured and academic approach to learning continued to have a significant influence on the type of curriculum implemented by the preschools (Ebbeck and Chan 2011). Li et al. (2012) found that teacher-directed and explicit instruction was still predominantly used in Singapore preschool classrooms to teach Chinese, suggesting minimal changes in the teaching practice. In order to foster parents’ understanding of what constitutes quality and appropriate PSE, the MOE published a guide for parents to communicate and clarify the goals and objectives of the NEL Framework in 2012. In addition, concerted efforts <b>have</b> also <b>been</b> made by the MOE, ECDA, and other agencies in organizing or supporting seminars and forums for parents to learn more about holistic development of children and ways to nurture children as lifelong learners. Nevertheless, even if the intentions and aspirations for PSE held by MOE <b>have</b> <b>been</b> clearly made known to the public, the question that remains is whether these efforts are embraced by the broader community and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>impactful</b> in preventing preschool teachers from over-teaching and parents from over-preparing their children for primary school. But as long as parents continue to perceive a rift between the intended expectations for joyful and playful learning in PSE and the realities of an academic knowledge and skills-based learning approach in primary school education, the expectations for preschool children to be academically prepared will persist. Furthermore, Burgess and Fleet (2009) cautioned that curriculum innovations promoted through a non-mandatory document might not be implemented as the daily mundane issues and habitual practices occurring in the classroom teachers may overwhelm teachers.|$|R

40|$|The current {{economic}} crisis has reached global proportions.

What <b>has</b> gone unexamined <b>is</b> the effect this crisis <b>is</b> <b>having</b> on the protection and safety of our children, in particular, from sexual predators. This paper will examine the economic crisis {{and its impact on the}} ability of government to properly manage and supervise the tens of thousands of known sexual predators who live within our communities. The State of Nevada has over 13, 000 known sex offenders within its borders. The focus of this assessment will be to analyze the ability of the state to continue effective supervision and monitoring of these offenders in light of the hiring freezes, departmental cutbacks, prison closings, and training limitations which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> placed on the Department of Corrections and the Division of Parole and Probation.

40|$|Franz Biebl’s Ave Maria {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{well-known}} small-scale choral pieces written in the latter half of the twentieth century. Since its introduction to American choirs in 1970, it has become an important part of the standard choral repertoire and is often performed perennially, especially at Christmas. It was integral to the rise in popularity of Chanticleer, the American professional male chorus, and remains closely associated with the ensemble thanks to it being recorded and published in the United States under Chanticleer’s auspices. Despite these facts, very little <b>has</b> <b>been</b> written about the composer or his iconic setting of the ancient prayer to the Virgin. This project attempts to collect currently available biographical and historical information from sources in Germany and the United States and to reveal new discoveries from personal interviews and previously unpublished letters and recordings. I begin with a comprehensive biography of the composer and the circumstances surrounding the composition of the Ave Maria. I then provide a musical analysis of the piece, uncovering its formal design and signature harmonies. A chronicle of the Ave Maria’s reception in the United States follows, with attention paid to its “discovery” by American collegiate glee clubs, its close association with Chanticleer, and its role in an important legal battle. I conclude with anecdotes and reflections pertaining to the Ave Maria that attempt to help explain why the piece <b>has</b> <b>been</b> so <b>impactful</b> to countless choirs and their audiences. ...|$|R
