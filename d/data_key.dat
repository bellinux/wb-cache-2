5000|$|Data keys {{need not}} be a direct {{hardware}} address in memory. Indirect, abstract and logical keys codes can be stored in association with values to form a data structure. Data structures have predetermined offsets (or links or paths) {{from the start of the}} structure, in which data values are stored. Therefore, the <b>data</b> <b>key</b> consists of the key to the structure plus the offset (or links or paths) into the structure. When such a structure is repeated, storing variations of data values and the data keys within the same repeating structure, the result can be considered to resemble a table, in which each element of the repeating structure is considered to be a column and each repetition of the structure is considered as a row of the table. In such an organization of data, the <b>data</b> <b>key</b> is usually a value in one (or a composite of the values in several of) the columns.|$|E

50|$|The Commission termed this a {{terrorist}} attack, and {{raised questions about}} the intelligence support available to it (emphasis added): Intelligence provided a good picture of the broad threat facing the USMNF multinational force in Lebanon.

There was an awareness of the existing dangerous situation at every level, but no one had specific information on how, where and when the threat would be carried out. Throughout the period of the USMNF presence in Lebanon, intelligence sources were unable to provide proven, accurate, definitive information on terrorist tactics against our forces. This shortcoming held to be the case on October 23, 1983. The terrorist threat was just one among many threats facing the USMNF from the many factions armed with artillery, crew served weapons and small arms.|$|E
5000|$|Until {{the advent}} of {{non-volatile}} computer memories like USB sticks, persistent data storage was traditionally achieved by writing the data to external block devices like magnetic tape and disk drives. These devices typically seek to a location on the magnetic media and then read or write blocks of data of a predetermined size. In this case, the seek location on the media,is the <b>data</b> <b>key</b> and the blocks are the data values. Early data file-systems, or disc operating systems used to reserve contiguous blocks on the disc drive for data files. In those systems, the files could be filled up, running out of data space before all the data had been written to them. Thus much unused data space was reserved unproductively to avoid incurring that situation. This was known as raw disk. Later file-systems introduced partitions. They reserved blocks of disc data space for partitions and used the allocated blocks more economically, by dynamically assigning blocks of a partition to a file as needed. To achieve this, the file-system had {{to keep track of}} which blocks were used or unused by data files in a catalog or file allocation table. Though this made better use of the disc data space, it resulted in fragmentation of files across the disc, and a concomitant performance overhead due to latency. Modern file systems reorganize fragmented files dynamically to optimize file access times. Further developments in file systems resulted in virtualization of disc drives i.e. where a logical drive can be defined as partitions from a number of physical drives.|$|E
