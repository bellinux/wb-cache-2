5|$|In humans, APOA5 is {{expressed}} {{almost exclusively in}} the liver tissue; some minor expressions have also been <b>detected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> small intestine.

In comparison with other apolipoproteins, plasma concentration of APOA5 is very low (less than 1 μg/mL).

APOA5 is associated predominantly with TG-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons and VLDL) and has also been detected on HDL particles.|$|E

5|$|Magnetic fields {{have been}} <b>detected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> space around {{just about every}} class of {{celestial}} object.

This {{has been used to}} show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies. Magneto-hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes. Non-thermal radio sources have been detected even among the most distant, high-z sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.|$|E
