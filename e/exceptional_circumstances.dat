5|$|Before the Reformation, the {{extensive}} prohibited degrees of kinship, {{up to the}} fourth degree through consanguinity, meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation.

After the mid-sixteenth century the prohibited degrees were reduced to those in Leviticus 13: 4–13, which limited them to relationships in the second degree of kinship. Separation from bed and board continued to be allowed in <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstances,</b> usually adultery, and under the Reformed Kirk divorce was allowed on grounds of adultery or desertion. Scotland {{was one of the first}} countries to allow desertion as legal grounds for divorce and, unlike England, where divorce necessitated and act of parliament, divorce cases were initiated relatively far down the social scale.|$|E

The prosecution was seeking a sentence of 30 years. Peru does not issue life sentences in standard cases of murder and has abolished capital punishment in all but <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstances,</b> such as crimes committed under military law.

As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstances.</b> This was to enable the 'home grown' rule to be enacted, whereby the League would also from 2010 require at least 8 of the named 25 man squad to be made up of 'home-grown players'.|$|E
5|$|Marriages, {{particularly}} {{higher in}} society, were often political {{in nature and}} the subject of complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s, or as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners for others. Before the Reformation, the extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation, which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, although there was no divorce as such.

5|$|O'Sullivan {{returned}} to {{action at the}} Masters, to a mixed response from the audience (being both booed and clapped). He won his first round match 6–1 on 16 January 2007, against Ali Carter, making two century breaks in the process. However, he then created more controversy by failing to attend a post-match press conference. He did record a short interview with Steve Davis for the BBC, stating that he was much happier than at the UK Championship, {{and that he was}} playing well once again. Sir Rodney Walker later issued a statement declaring that O'Sullivan had been excused from dealing with the media because of the <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstances</b> affecting him. This decision was criticised by Shaun Murphy. O'Sullivan {{went on to win the}} tournament against Ding Junhui, on 21 January 2007. In the match, he was noted for his good sportsmanship by Steve Davis, specifically for comforting Ding after the twelfth frame, during which Ding had become visibly upset by an overly partisan member of the crowd, who was later ejected. O'Sullivan was leading 9–3 at the time, and won the next frame for a 10–3 victory.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton and Madison thus had {{two major}} concerns: (1) the {{detrimental}} effect on liberty and democracy {{of a large}} standing army and (2) the ability of an unchecked legislature or executive to take the country to war precipitously.

Until the 1950s, the maintenance of a large military force by the United States was an <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstance</b> and was restricted to times of war.

5|$|With many mining {{communities}} suffering {{high levels}} of unemployment following the General Strike, some Poor Law boards granted relief to unemployed workers by misusing provisions intended for <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstances.</b> These boards used the provisions to give benefits to nearly all applicants. With the system thrown into crisis, Chamberlain sought legislation to permit the Minister of Health to dismiss recalcitrant boards, and later got Parliament to pass further legislation to prescribe criminal penalties to members of such boards. Though no board members were prosecuted, Chamberlain dismissed three boards, replacing their members with his own appointees. Finally, in 1929, Chamberlain brought in legislation to abolish the Poor Law boards entirely, replacing them with bodies appointed by local authorities. Chamberlain spoke in the Commons {{for two and a}} half hours on the second reading of the Bill, and when he concluded, he was applauded by all parties. The Local Government Act 1929 passed by an ample majority, and the Morning Post commented that (despite Labour attacks), it had been found to be impossible to make it unpopular.|$|E
5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstances,</b> and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E

A line of battalion double-company columns is most difficult to preserve in the darkness, and any confusion may lead to disaster.
