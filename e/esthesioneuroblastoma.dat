40|$|SummaryObjectiveEsthesioneuroblastoma is an {{uncommon}} tumor that is described widely among the Caucasians. In Singapore, we see predominantly Asian patients with <b>esthesioneuroblastomas.</b> From our experience, we note significant and interesting differences between our data on Asian patients and the published {{ones on the}} Caucasian patients. MethodsA retrospective review of all patients who underwent craniofacial resection for <b>esthesioneuroblastomas</b> was conducted from January 1997 to January 2010. Relevant data were collected and statistical analyses were carried out to determine factors that predicted mortality or complications. ResultsOut {{of a total of}} 48 patients who underwent craniofacial resections, half had <b>esthesioneuroblastomas</b> (50 %). There was a peak age distribution at the sixth decade of life and 62 % of our patients were male. Both local and regional recurrence rate was 50 %. ConclusionMajority of our Asian patients who underwent craniofacial resections had <b>esthesioneuroblastomas.</b> There is a male predilection, and we do not see a bimodal age distribution that is commonly reported...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 15 {{patients}} with <b>esthesioneuroblastomas</b> were treated between 1978 and 1992 at the Neurosurgery Department, Nordstadt Hospital, Hannover. In 9 cases, the tumors invaded the anterior cranial fossa. One patient died before any surgical intervention. Eight tumors were {{operated by a}} combined paranasal and subfrontal approach. Gross total tumor removal was achieved in all cases. Apart from anosmia, the only postoperative complication was transient mental changes in one case. Immunohistochemical analyses with MIB 1 monoclonal antibodies, directed against recombinant parts of Ki- 67 antigen, were performed to estimate the proliferative potential of the <b>esthesioneuroblastomas.</b> Most of the tumors showed high proliferating cell indexes, which ranged from 3 to 42 % (mean, 16 %). The proliferating cell index with MIB 1 showed a correlation with postoperative outcome, although this was not statistically significant. <b>Esthesioneuroblastomas</b> can be totally removed surgically. The proliferating cell index may reflect histologically the biological behavior of tumor. Long-term follow-up is mandatory, and imunohistochemical studies may be of help in predicting outcome.

5000|$|<b>Esthesioneuroblastoma,</b> {{also called}} [...] "olfactory neuroblastoma", {{is a rare}} cancer of the nasal cavity. Arising from the upper nasal tract, <b>esthesioneuroblastoma</b> is {{believed}} to originate from sensory neuroepithelial cells, also known as neuroectodermal olfactory cells. Fewer than 700 cases have been documented in the United States. Due {{to the location of}} the tumor and its proximity to the cranial cavity, <b>esthesioneuroblastoma</b> can be highly invasive and challenging to treat. There is no consensus on appropriate treatment approach of <b>esthesioneuroblastoma</b> because of the rarity of the disease.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case of}} an olfactory neuroblastoma, treated with minimally invasive endoscopic resection, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and critically reviews the current literature with regard to diagnosis and management of such malignancies. Olfactory neuroblastoma {{is considered to be}} an uncommon malignancy of the nasal cavity. The tumor arises from the specialized sensory epithelial olfactory cells, normally situated at {{the upper part of the}} nasal cavity, including the superior nasal concha, the roof of the nose and the cribriform plate. The imaging modality of choice is computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Combination of surgery and radiotherapy is considered to be the standard of care for primary site disease by the majority of researchers. Combined transfacial and neurosurgical conventional approaches are adopted in most cases, mainly due to the endocranial extension and the close anatomic relationship of <b>esthesioneuroblastomas</b> with the ethmoid roof and cribriform plate. However, recent literature supports that endoscopic resection correlates with similar oncologic control rates, compared with open surgery, when basic oncologic surgical principles are maintained...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether very radiodense material within a sinonasal soft-tissue mass on CT can be differentiated as calcification, ossification, or residual bone. METHODS: We retrospec-tively described the radiodensities within 235 sinonasal soft-tissue masses as discrete, solitary or multiple, or as a diffuse process {{with either a}} well-defined or poorly defined margin. They were also classified as calcification, ossification, or residual bone. Findings were correlated with pathologic specimens. RESULTS: Residual bone was underdiagnosed; calcification was overdi-agnosed. A solitary discrete density was {{most likely to be}} calcification within an inflammatory mass. However, multiple discrete densities were as likely to be in a tumor as in an inflammatory lesion. If the process was diffuse with a well-defined margin, it was most likely to be a benign fibroosseous lesion. If the process was diffuse with a poorly defined margin, it was most likely to be a high-grade sarcoma. Densities within inverted papillomas were shown to be residual bone, not calcifications; densities within <b>esthesioneuroblastomas</b> were calcifications. CONCLUSION: Radiodensities may help in refining a CT diagnosis, but one may not know based on CT whether the density is a calcification, ossification, or residual bone...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Various {{transcranial}} and transfacial {{approaches have}} been described and each claims {{to provide the best}} exposure to the anterior skull base. Similarly, each approach claims the best outcomes following the resection of anterior skull base malignancies. We have always advocated a combined neurorhinological approach for the management of paranasal sinus malignancies that infiltrate the skull base, such as <b>esthesioneuroblastomas.</b> Materials and methods: At the outset, the technique was developed on cadaver specimens, imitating the limitations that might be imposed in the real-life situation when undertaking endoscopic sinus surgery. Additional exposure of the anterior cerebral fossa was achieved using a classical bifrontal approach. Starting with endoscopic or microscopic unroofing of the ethmoids, all relevant landmarks were identified. The frontal, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses were then opened using endoscopic techniques. Results: The dissections proved that a broad exposure of the anterior skull base could be combined with clear endoscopic visualization of the nasal cavity and of all the paranasal sinuses from above. This facilitated complete eradication of lesions from the sinuses cavities, their walls, and the intracranial tumor. Discussion: The combined neurorhinosurgical transcranial approach to the anterior skull base and nasal and paranasal sinuses, avoiding trans-facial approaches, enables a multidiciplinary team to resect malignant tumors of the anterior skull base directly without unnecessary destruction of facial structures. It appears to provide better access than other more destructive methods like midfacial degloving or subfrontal approaches. Our single-stage approach also facilitates safe and effective reconstruction of the skull base. The technique can be employed for tumors of all sizes and is also used for orbital resections and decompression of the optic nerve and chiasma...|$|R

40|$|The neural cell {{adhesion}} molecule (NCAM) was discovered {{in a search for}} cell surface antigens of chicken neurons that contribute to {{cell adhesion}} and pattern formation during development. Homologous adhesion molecules have been identified in several species, including humans. In this immunohistochemical study, the authors examine the role of human NCAM in tumor diagnosis. The authors used a monoclonal antibody (MAb), 5. 1 H 11, to examine NCAM immunoreactivity in frozen sections of more than 450 tumors, including more than 80 small round cell tumors (SRCT) of childhood and adolescence (neuroblastomas, Ewing's sarcomas [ES], peripheral neuroepitheliomas [PN], primitive neuroectodermal tumors [PNET], <b>esthesioneuroblastomas,</b> malignant ectomesenchymoma, medulloblastomas, small cell osteosarcomas, mesenchymal chondrosarcomas, embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, and lymphomas). The authors show that 1) neuroblastomas and primary brain tumors are NCAM+; 2) ES, most PN/PNETs, and melanomas are NCAM-; 3) embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas and various other sarcomas are NCAM+; 4) neuroendocrine tumors are NCAM+; 5) subsets of carcinomas of kidney, ovary, lung and other organs are NCAM+; and 6) lymphoid tumors are NCAM-. Tests with normal fetal and adult tissues indicate that these findings reflect only in part the NCAM phenotypes of corresponding normal tissues. Notably the NCAM- phenotype of ES and PN/PNET is not explained by current histogenetic models for these tumors, which suggest a primitive neuroectodermal origin. Finally the authors show that NCAM expression among SRCT has an inverse relationship with the expression of p 30 / 32 MIC 2, a cell surface antigen of ES and PN/PNET detected with MAb HBA 71. These results suggest that immunohistochemical assays for NCAM and p 30 / 32 MIC 2 expression may aid in the further characterization of SRCT of childhood and adolescence...|$|R

50|$|<b>Esthesioneuroblastoma</b> {{is a slow}} {{developing}} but malignant tumor {{with high}} reoccurrence rates because of its anatomical position. The tumor composition, location and metastatic characteristics {{as well as the}} treatment plan determine prognosis. Common clinical classification systems for <b>esthesioneuroblastoma</b> include the Kadish classification and the Dulguerov classfictation. Histopathological characteristics on top of Kadish classification can further determine cancer prognosis. In severe, Kadish class C tumors, Haym's grades of pathology are important for prognosis. Patients with low grade Kadish class C tumors have a 10-year survival rate of 86 percent compared to patients with high grade class C tumors who have a survival rate of 28 percent. Surgically treated patients with high grade tumors are more likely to experience leptomeningeal metastases or involvement of the cerebral spinal fluid unlike patients with low grade tumors who usually only see local recurrence. Survival rates for treated <b>esthesioneuroblastoma</b> are best for surgery with radiotherapy (65%), then for radiotherapy and chemotherapy (51%), just surgery (48%), surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy (47) and finally just radiotherapy (37%). From the literature, radiotherapy and surgery seem to boast the best outcome for patients. However, {{it is important to understand}} that to some degree, prognosis is related to tumor severity. More progressed, higher grade tumors would result in chemotherapy or radiotherapy as the only treatment. It is no surprise that the prognosis would be worse in these cases.|$|E
