30|$|Finally, in a {{study in}} {{participants}} suffering from job-related exhaustion (and therefore a suspected impaired CAR), there {{did not appear to}} be any change <b>in</b> <b>CAR</b> following the 12 -week aerobic exercise intervention [55].

This null finding may in fact be considered a positive effect of exercise in these chronically fatigued individuals. It is possible that exercise prevented any further shift <b>in</b> <b>CAR</b> <b>in</b> these subjects (i.e., perhaps a basement effect was observed). Of course, longitudinal analysis of this population should be conducted to test these hypotheses.|$|R

A small square microphone array with 4 sensors was adopted in this paper to localize the sound source <b>in</b> <b>car</b> for fault diagnosis. A new voice activity detection (VAD) algorithm was proposed for the typical discontinuous short-time noise <b>in</b> <b>car</b> due to some fault and applied to direction of arrival (DOA) estimation as a pre-processing stage. Four different time delay estimation methods were compared based on the measurements from a typical passenger. Experimental results illustrate that the VAD algorithm is crucial to achieve robust fault localization performance and the generalized cross-correlation method with phase transform weighting function is an appropriate fault localizer <b>in</b> <b>car.</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|Ash may disrupt {{transportation}} systems over large areas for hours to days, including roads and vehicles, railways and ports and shipping. Falling ash {{will reduce the}} visibility which can make driving difficult and dangerous. In addition, fast travelling cars will stir up ash, creating billowing clouds which perpetuate ongoing visibility hazards. Ash accumulations will decrease traction, especially when wet, and cover road markings. Fine-grained ash can infiltrate openings <b>in</b> <b>cars</b> and abrade most surfaces, especially between moving parts. Air and oil filters will become blocked requiring frequent replacement. Rail transport is less vulnerable, with disruptions mainly caused by reduction in visibility.|$|E
