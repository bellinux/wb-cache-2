25|$|Shortly {{after the}} war ended in 1945 Hans Nielsen and Helsingør Skibsværft created a new {{shipyard}} in Aarhus named I/S Aarhus Flydedok og Maskinkompagni.

Establishment of industries at Port Tennant, which included Charles Lambert's copper{{works in the}} 1850s and a patent fuel works in the 1860s, resulted in increased traffic of coal, from both Glan-y-wern and Tir-isaf collieries.

500|$|The Game Boy Advance re-release {{as part of}} the Classic NES series holds {{a rating}} of 66% on Metacritic based on 10 reviews.

500|$|Not all {{fans were}} {{happy with the}} {{direction}} the Fallout series was taken in since its acquisition by Bethesda Softworks. Notorious for their support of the series' first two games, Fallout and Fallout 2, members centered {{around one of the}} oldest Fallout fansites, No Mutants Allowed, have criticized departures from the original games' stories, gameplay mechanics and setting. Criticisms include the prevalence of unspoiled food after 200 years, the survival of wood-framed dwellings following a nuclear blast, and the ubiquity of Super Mutants at early levels in the game. Also criticized are the quality of the game's writing, its level of verisimilitude, the switch to a first-person action game format, and the level of reactiveness of the surrounding game world to player actions. In response, Jim Sterling of Destructoid has called fan groups like No Mutants Allowed [...] "selfish" [...] and [...] "arrogant"; stating that a new audience deserves a chance to play a Fallout game; and that if the series had stayed the way <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> 1997, new titles would never have been made and brought to market. Luke Winkie of Kotaku tempers these sentiments, saying that {{it is a matter of}} ownership; and that in the case of Fallout 3, hardcore fans of the original series witnessed their favorite games become transformed into something else.|$|E
