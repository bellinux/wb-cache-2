2500|$|Although the Roebling bridge, {{with its}} iron superstructure, was {{generally}} believed non-flammable, it {{fell victim to}} fire on June 19, 1881. The bridge was not destroyed, but its <b>floor</b> <b>system</b> of white pine and white oak was severely damaged. John Harper, president of the Allegheny Bridge Company, which owned and operated the structure, stated that he believed the fire {{was the result of}} [...] "sparks and perhaps flame from the stacks" [...] of passing steamboats igniting bird nests located under the superstructure of the bridge. After heavy electric streetcars were introduced to the bridge in 1890, concern over its functional capacity grew, and in 1891 plans were begun to replace the suspension bridge with one that could better handle the steadily increasing traffic, as well as permit trolleys to cross without reducing their speed.|$|E
40|$|Experience in {{the design}} of steel and {{concrete}} <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> to control vibrations suggests that a <b>floor</b> <b>system’s</b> vibration characteristics are often fundamental to its acceptable performance. In such cases, serviceability drives the design instead of strength. This is particularly true for laboratory floors that support sensitive equipment and floor girders that fall within certain spans. This paper discusses the initiation of a long-term collaborative research program between Tufts University and LeMessurier Consultants to investigate the vibration characteristics of a variety of <b>floor</b> <b>systems.</b> Examples include new concrete-steel composite <b>floor</b> <b>systems,</b> concrete <b>floor</b> <b>systems,</b> and irregular <b>floor</b> <b>systems,</b> and <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> that have required remediation. The paper introduces well-known basic floor vibration equations and parameters, and discusses the possibility for developing further the concepts inherent in these equations for the purposes of improved conceptual design of <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> to control vibrations...|$|R

Cold-formed steel <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> are usually lighter and have less inherent damping. If designers {{are going to use}} the current span deflection criteria when designing residential <b>floor</b> <b>systems,</b> it is imperative to find the construction and design details that will limit these annoying vibrations in cold-formed steel <b>floor</b> <b>systems.</b> Presented in this seminar are the results from a recent laboratory study and field study on the vibration characteristics of cold-formed steel floors performed at the University of Waterloo. Several full-scale <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> with varying construction and design details were constructed and tested, and several in situ <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> were tested. The objectives of this research were: to evaluate the dynamic response of residential <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> supported by cold-formed steel joists; to investigate the influence of span length, joist types, subfloor materials, toppings, ceilings, strongbacks, live loads and framing conditions on the vibration characteristics of cold-formed steel floor systems; to identify the critical construction details that will limit annoying floor vibrations; to compare the vibration characteristics of in situ <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> and laboratory constructed floor systems; and to evaluate the vibration performance of laboratory and in situ <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> based on current acceptability criteria...|$|R

40|$|Buildings {{that are}} not {{designed}} to have fire safety measures {{are not able to}} endure the extreme conditions in a fire event. Hence considerably more attention is being placed on the fire safety of buildings in recent times. Light gauge steel framed (LSF) <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> are commonly used in buildings as they provide significant benefit by reducing weight and cost while increasing construction efficiencies. To obtain a satisfactory fire resistance level, <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> must comply with a number of requirements speciﬁed in codes relating to ﬁre resistance level. However, to understand the heat transfer process within LSF <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> usually requires numerous complex fire tests. These tests are extremely expensive and time consuming. Therefore three-dimensional finite element models were developed and used in this study to investigate the heat transfer in LSF <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> made of different joist sections such as Lipped Channel and Hollow Flange Channel beam sections. Standard fire curve was defined as an amplitude curve following a time-temperature profile based on ISO 834 standard fire curve. The time-temperature curves obtained from the finite element analyses were compared with available experimental results to determine their accuracy in predicting the heat transfer in LSF <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> made of the two chosen joist sections. Results showed that the proposed three-dimensional finite element models can accurately predict the heat transfer of LSF <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> made with lipped channel and hollow flange channel section joists. They also highlighted the differences in the thermal performance when different joist types are used. This paper presents the details of a three-dimensional thermal modelling study of LSF <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> made of lipped Channel and hollow flange channel section joists and the results. Innovative LSF <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> were also proposed using the validated thermal models to enhance the fire resistant rating...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Occupant comfort when large-span <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> are {{subjected}} to crowd-induced vibrations has become an important index to evaluate serviceability of structures. Control of deflections stipulated in current code requirements cannot sufficiently represent the serviceability requirements of <b>floor</b> <b>systems.</b> Harmonic vibration analysis procedure is introduced by foreign code requirements to deal with floor vibrations, with the restriction to those with regular shapes and simple boundary conditions. This paper proposes a time-history analysis program for the generation of load induced by human activities based on the stimulation of group walking, analyzing the <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> with special boundary condition, span and damping by time-history method. Compared {{with the results of}} crowd-induced load experiment, the analytical results confirmed the accuracy of this analysis procedure in representing the characteristic of crowd-induced floor vibrations, which is applicable for evaluation of <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> with arbitrary shape and boundary condition...|$|R
