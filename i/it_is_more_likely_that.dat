5|$|Due to its location, the Church of St Peter {{is often}} {{described}} as a cemetery church. However, scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it improbable that an ordinary village cemetery church would have an inscription by a Bulgarian tsar. In her opinion, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the church was constructed by a noble person related to the court of the Second Bulgarian Empire.|$|E
5|$|Moorman {{suggests}} that Lucy may represent Wordsworth's romantic interest Mary Hutchinson, but wonders {{why she would}} be represented as one who died. It is possible that Wordsworth was thinking of Margaret Hutchinson, Mary's sister who had died. There is no evidence, however, that the poet loved any of the Hutchinsons other than Mary. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Margaret's death influenced but is not the foundation for Lucy.|$|E
5|$|The army of {{the early}} Republic {{continued}} to evolve, and {{although there was a}} tendency among Romans to attribute such changes to great reformers, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> changes were the product of slow evolution rather than singular and deliberate policy of reform. The manipular formation was probably copied from Rome's Samnite enemies to the south, perhaps as a result of Roman defeats in the Second Samnite War.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{swelling}} {{is over the}} area of the root apex, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> a periapical abscess; if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> closer to the gingival margin, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> a periodontal abscess.|$|R
30|$|When a {{neighboring}} node {{is located on}} the border of a target node's coverage area, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> {{to get out of the}} transmission range and, consequently, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to break an established link.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the tooth}} has {{pre-existing}} periodontal disease, with pockets {{and loss of}} alveolar bone height, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> a periodontal abscess; whereas if the tooth has relatively healthy periodontal condition, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> a periapical abscess.|$|R
5|$|Alexius Slav's {{marriage}} to the daughter of Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders in 1209 was potentially a great danger to Boril, who could be facing their joint forces. Fearing such a coalition, Boril approached Strez, {{who was at the}} time gaining more power and was close to complete independence from Serbia. Strez agreed to a union with his former enemy, though only after Boril reconfirmed his complete autonomy. Strez eliminated the remaining Serbian troops in his lands in an act that the Serbs saw as devil-inspired treason. It is not impossible that Boril persuaded Strez through military action, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the union was achieved through negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Although Sarah {{implied that}} she had {{encouraged}} the escape {{for the safety of}} Princess Anne, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> she was protecting herself and her husband. If James succeeded in defeating Prince William of Orange in battle he might imprison and even execute Lord and Lady Churchill for treason, whereas it was unlikely he would condemn his daughter to a similar fate. But James fled to France in December 1688 rather than confront the invading army, allowing William to take over his throne.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} letter to Tacitus, Pliny the Younger {{suggested}} that his uncle's death {{was due to the}} reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, sulphurous gas that wafted over the group. However, Stabiae was 16km from the vent (roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the volcanic gases, and so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack. His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the same}} genera were present across these formations, though they varied at the species level. For example, the Djadochta was {{inhabited}} by Velociraptor mongoliensis, Protoceratops andrewsi, and Pinacosaurus grangeri, while the Bayan Mandahu was home to Velociraptor osmolskae, Protoceratops hellenikorhinus, and Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus. These differences in species composition may be due a natural barrier separating the two formations, which are relatively {{close to each other}} geographically. However, given the lack of any known barrier which would cause the specific faunal compositions found in these areas, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> those differences indicate a slight time difference.|$|E
5|$|Paulinus' missionary {{efforts are}} {{difficult}} to evaluate. Bede implies that the mission in Northumbria was successful, {{but there is little}} supporting evidence, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Paulinus' missionary efforts there were relatively ineffectual. Although Osric, one of Edwin's successors, was converted to Christianity by Paulinus, he returned to paganism after Edwin's death. Hilda, however, remained a Christian, and eventually went on to become abbess of the influential Whitby Abbey. Northumbria's conversion to Christianity was mainly achieved by Irish missionaries brought into the region by Edwin's eventual successor, Oswald.|$|E
5|$|The known {{range of}} Boletopsis nothofagi {{is limited to}} two {{narrowly}} defined areas of New Zealand, one on the North Island {{and the other on}} the South Island. These areas are in Rimutaka Forest Park near Wellington, and Saint Arnaud {{in the northern part of}} the South Island. These locations are relatively far away from each other and isolated, which, together with its absence in the rest of New Zealand, makes it unlikely that the species is a recent import. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the species is native to New Zealand and has been overlooked in earlier surveys due to its rarity.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} this pulsar planet is still uncertain, but it {{probably}} did not form where it is found today. Because of the decreased gravitational force when the core of star collapses to a neutron star and ejects most of its mass in a supernova explosion, {{it is unlikely that}} a planet could remain in orbit after such an event. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the planet formed in orbit around the star that has now evolved into the white dwarf, and that the star and planet were only later captured into orbit around the neutron star.|$|E
5|$|While {{features}} of the limbs indicate that aetosaurs probably dug for food, {{features of}} the skull and teeth can indicate what kind of food they were eating. Aetosaurs have many derived features not seen in other crurotarsans, which indicate that they are adapted to a different diet. Unlike the sharp, recurved teeth of other triassic archosaurs, aetosaurs had simple, conical teeth. The tips of the jaws were edentulous, or toothless, and probably supported a beak. The teeth have very little wear, suggesting that aetosaurs did not consume stiff and tough plant material. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> they consumed non-abrasive vegetation such as soft leaves.|$|E
5|$|Afonso III of Portugal was not {{the eldest}} son, {{therefore}} heraldic practices stated he should not take his father's arms without adding a personal variation. Before becoming king, Afonso was married to Matilda II of Boulogne but her inability to provide him with a royal heir led Afonso to divorce her, in 1253. He then married Beatrice of Castile, an illegitimate daughter of Alfonso X of Castile. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> it was this family connection with Castile (his mother was also Castilian) that justified the new heraldic addition to the royal arms—a red bordure charged with an undetermined number of yellow castles—rather than the definitive conquest of the Algarve and its Moorish fortresses, considering {{that the number of}} castles was only fixed in the late 16th century.|$|E

5|$|Al-Mu'tadid {{died at the}} Hasani palace on 5 April 902, at the age {{of either}} 40 or 47. There were rumours that he had been poisoned, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the rigours of his campaigns, coupled with his dissolute life, {{severely}} weakened his health. During his final illness, he refused to follow the advice of his physicians, and even kicked one of them to death. He left behind him four sons and several daughters. Al-Mu'tadid was the first Abbasid caliph to be buried within the walls of Baghdad. Like his sons after him, he was buried in the former Tahirid palace {{in the western part of}} the city, which was now used by the caliphs as a secondary residence.|$|E
5|$|Authors {{have speculated}} {{on a range}} of {{buildings}} that could account for the Tower appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a Norman peel tower, built as a defence against Scottish raiders or might have been a disused poacher's lookout, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage. Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation. Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel, and tower may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents. It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Pyrrhus {{was able}} to enter Argos. While Pausanias recounts that he did so by force, Plutarch asserts that Diamperes Gate had been left open for the Epiriotes by Aristeas. Hammond opines that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Aristeas {{admitted}} Pyrrhus into the city. Although Pyrrhus' Gauls were able to occupy the Argive agora, {{the rest of the}} army was delayed due to the war elephants being too large to pass through the gate. In order for them to enter, the towers need to be taken off their backs and reattached once they were inside the city. Furthermore, Pyrrhus left the majority of his army outside the city walls under the command of his son Helenus. This delay gave the Argives enough time to reach their citadel, the Aspis, and seek aid from Antigonus. The Macedonian king responded immediately, advancing towards the city walls and sending a relief force inside under the command of his son Halcyoneus.|$|E
5000|$|Hypopigmentation <b>is</b> <b>more</b> {{commonly}} {{observed in}} darker skin tones. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to occur with higher fluence and more frequent treatments. Sometimes lighter skin exhibits hypopigmentation {{after a series}} of treatments. Allowing more time between treatments reduces chances of hypopigmentation. Since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to see hypopigmentation after multiple treatments, some practitioners suggest waiting a few additional weeks, after a few sessions. Usually treatment stops until hypopigmentation resolves in a matter of months.|$|R

5|$|Historical records {{report that}} Minyue and Dongyue were emptied of people, {{and that its}} {{residents}} were deported to the territories between the Huai River and the Yangtze River. The alleged population transfer was a resumption of a policy that had been planned since 138 BC. The Han government considered the mountainous region difficult to control and was wary of trusting its residents. Modern historians doubt the event happened. The deportation of an entire kingdom is implausible, and nothing {{has been found to}} verify a migration of Han settlers to the Minyue region around the year 1, something that would have occurred had the area been abandoned while under Han control. There was only one town of Han settlers, Dongyue, in Minyue. Dongyue was built where the Min River meets the sea, around the time of Emperor Wu's reign. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the assimilation of Minyue into Han Chinese culture through Han conquest happened later in the dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Middlewich {{was founded}} by the Romans, who gave it the name Salinae because of its {{surrounding}} salt deposits. It {{became one of the}} major Roman sites for salt production, an activity that was centred on the township of Kinderton, {{about a quarter of a}} mile north of the present-day parish church of St. Michael and All Angels. It has been suggested that pre-Roman salt production also occurred in the same area, but there is no supporting archaeological evidence. Whittaker's History of Manchester claims that the Iron Age Cornovii made Kinderton their capital, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the Cornovii inhabited Kinderton for its salt-making potential. There was once thought to have been a medieval castle at Kinderton, but that is now thought to have been unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Since {{classical}} antiquity, {{the area}} around Kvarner Bay has been characterized as a meeting point of diverse cultures—from Hellenic and Roman cultures, through the Middle Ages and a succession of various rulers, to the present day. This blending {{is reflected in the}} folklore of the area, including Zvončari—bell-ringers best known for annual pageant in Kastav, listed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Crossbowmen from Rab are a living history company reenacting an arbalest tournament first held in 1364 to commemorate the successful defence of the island using that weapon. A typical decorative motif used in the region is morčić (plural: morčići)—a dark skinned Moor used as a centerpiece on jewelry, usually earrings. Legend has it that the motif is related to a hypothesized battle between Croatian and Ottoman armies on Grobnik north of Rijeka, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> it is of Venetian origin, as it is similar to the Venetian moretti motif, used mostly on brooches and pins.|$|E
