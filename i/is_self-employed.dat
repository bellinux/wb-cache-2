While agriculture employment has fallen over time in percentage of labour employed, services which includes construction and infrastructure have seen a steady growth accounting for 20.3% of employment in 201213. Of the total workforce, 7% is in the organised sector, two-thirds {{of which are in}} the government-controlled public sector. About 51.2% of the workforce in India <b>is</b> <b>self-employed.</b> According to a 200506 survey, there is a gender gap in employment and salaries.

2500|$|Where {{a person}} works at night, {{he or she}} may only do 8 hours in any 24-hour period on average, or simply 8 hours at most if the work is {{classified}} as [...] "hazardous". Moreover, every worker must receive at least 11 consecutive hours of rest in a 24-hour period, and in every day workers must have at least a 20-minute break in any 6 hour period. The most controversial provisions in the working time laws concerns the right to a maximum working week. The labour movement has always bargained for a shorter working week as it increased economic productivity: the concept of a two-day [...] "weekend" [...] arose in the earlier 20th century, while France more recently implemented the right to a 35-hour workweek in 2000. Under the Directive, this EU maximum is 48 hours. The maximum does not apply to anyone who <b>is</b> <b>self-employed</b> or who can set their own hours of work. In Pfeiffer v Deutsches Rotes Kreuz the ECJ emphasised that the rules aim to protect workers who possess less bargaining power and autonomy over the way they do their jobs. Nevertheless, the UK government negotiated to let workers [...] "opt out" [...] of the 48-hour maximum by individually signing an opt out form. Theoretically and legally, a worker may always change his or her mind after having opted out, and has a right to sue the employer for suffering any detriment if they so choose. However, the obvious criticism has been made that the opt-out makes the right fictitious, because in jobs with a [...] "long hours culture", people are socially compelled to do what everyone else does. If the worker has not [...] "opted out", then the 48-hour week is not a rigid maximum, but is taken as an average over 17 weeks. Analogous to the minimum wage rules, [...] "on call" [...] time (where people must make themselves available, but are not necessarily active) is regarded as working time if the workers are bound to remain awake and close to their workplace. This created a significant problem for junior doctors, where in all European countries the culture has typically been that very long hours are expected. The European Court of Justice's decision in Landeshauptstadt Kiel v Jaegar that junior doctors' on call time was working time led a number of countries to exercise the same [...] "opt out" [...] derogation as the UK, though limited to medical practice. The Health and Safety Executive is the UK body charged with enforcing the working time laws, though it has taken a [...] "light touch" [...] approach to enforcement.|$|E
