40|$|Abstract — Marking in DiffServ at {{the edge}} of the network often follows a demand side policy. It meters a traffic stream and marks its packets {{according}} to some predefined traffic parameters as Committed Information Rate, Committed Burst Size, <b>Excess</b> <b>Burst</b> <b>Size</b> and so on. Such marking based on traffic characteristics is irrespective to network dynamics, which causes collision and QoS degradation in DiffServ. This paper proposes flow-based Reservation Marking as a supply side marking at the network edge, which marks stream packets reserved or unreserved according to flow-specific reservation in a distributed resource reservation environment. When conges-tion occurs, anticipant per flow QoS is secured by protecting reserved packets on core routers without any per flow or per trunk management. It provides a simple, scalable and adaptive mechanism of implementing quantitative end-to-end QoS by mapping per flow in IntServ into per class in DiffServ. A “once reserve, no more manage ” framework is constructed to eliminate flow state, avoiding unexpected collision and flow management simultaneously on core routers. Performance evaluation reveals that it affords controllable and quantitative QoS, keeps networks core-stateless and achieves high link utilization at the same time. I...|$|E

40|$|Temporal inhomogeneities in event {{sequences}} {{of natural and}} social phenomena have been characterized in terms of interevent times and correlations between interevent times. The inhomogeneities of interevent times have been extensively studied, while the correlations between interevent times, often called correlated bursts, are largely unexplored. For measuring the correlated bursts, two relevant approaches were suggested, i. e., memory coefficient and <b>burst</b> <b>size</b> distribution. Empirical analyses have revealed that the larger memory coefficient tends {{to be associated with}} the heavier tail of <b>burst</b> <b>size</b> distribution. In particular, empirical findings in human activities appear inconsistent, such that the memory coefficient is close to $ 0 $, while <b>burst</b> <b>size</b> distributions follow a power law. In order to comprehend these observations, we derive the analytical form of the memory coefficient as a function of parameters describing interevent time and <b>burst</b> <b>size</b> distributions. Our analytical result can explain the general tendency of the larger memory coefficient being associated with the heavier tail of <b>burst</b> <b>size</b> distribution. We also find that the apparently inconsistent observations in human activities are compatible with each other, indicating that the memory coefficient has limits to measure the correlated bursts.

30|$|The {{classical}} experiment of {{one step}} growth curve {{was carried out}} to differentiate phages {{on the basis of}} <b>burst</b> <b>size.</b> It was found that both phages HNΦ and 3 S are high titre phages which have latent period of 30  min and <b>burst</b> <b>size</b> for HNΦ was 110 but for 3 S it was 42. It can be speculated on the basis of latent period that both phages may belong to T-even series because 30  min duration of latent period is usually found for T-even E. coli phages, as calculated from Fig.  1. According to Shao and Wang (2008), phages that are characterized as Short latent periods phages (SLPs) have high adsorption rate, shorter latent period and they are able to infect multiple host in the environment, but they have reduced <b>burst</b> <b>size.</b> These findings of one step growth curve support the idea that HNΦ and 3 S may be taken as SLPS on the basis of latent period and <b>burst</b> <b>size.</b> The host range of phages was checked on heterologus host i.e. Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Shigella and different species of Salmonella and it was found that these phages were non lytic to any of these bacteria. But absence of plaques cannot rule out the possibility of lysogenic state of this phage into any of the host. However, screening of inducing factor was not done in present study. Previous research showed that T phages whose latent period is about 30  min have <b>burst</b> <b>size</b> in the range of 200 – 300 PFU/infection centre but for HNΦ <b>burst</b> <b>size</b> is 110 PFU/infection centre and for 3 S is 42 PFU/infection centre therefore only on the basis of short latent period and small <b>burst</b> <b>size</b> it is concluded that these phages are SLPs. However, {{further research is needed to}} determine adsorption rate and its activity against multiple hosts to confirm them as SLPs.|$|R

Tungstate compounds used as negative stains at neutral to slightly acidic pH are less effective in the detection of viral particles inside the cells. However, the use of tungstate compounds at low pH (3 or 4) substantially improved viral images, being positively contrasted inside the cells. With this improvement, the estimates of the frequency of viral-infected cells derived by the tungstate method agreed well with those determined by the use of UA for both lake and marine waters. We also found that the average <b>burst</b> <b>size</b> of the lake sample differed little between tungstate and the UA approach; however, the average <b>burst</b> <b>size</b> in a marine sample was underestimated by the tungstate method because of the failure to resolve highly packed viral particles. The above results suggest that the use of tungstate compounds at low pH can be a useful alternative to the UA approach for estimating the frequency of viral-infected cells in aquatic samples, but results on the <b>burst</b> <b>size</b> need to be interpreted cautiously when the <b>burst</b> <b>size</b> is high...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{expression}} is inherently a noisy process which manifests as cell-to-cell variability in time evolution of proteins. Consequently, events that trigger at critical threshold levels of regulatory proteins exhibit stochasticity in their timing. An important {{contributor to the}} noise in gene {{expression is}} translation bursts which correspond to randomness in number of proteins produced in a single mRNA lifetime. Modeling timing of an event as a first-passage time (FPT) problem, we explore the effect of <b>burst</b> <b>size</b> distribution on event timing. Towards this end, the probability density function of FPT is computed for a gene expression model with <b>burst</b> <b>size</b> drawn from a generic non-negative distribution. Analytical formulas for FPT moments are provided in terms of known vectors and inverse of a matrix. The effect of <b>burst</b> <b>size</b> distribution is investigated by looking at how the feedback regulation strategy that minimizes noise in timing around a given time deviates from the case when burst is deterministic. Interestingly, {{results show that the}} feedback strategy for deterministic burst case is quite robust to change in <b>burst</b> <b>size</b> distribution, and deviations from it are confined to about 20 % of the optimal value. These findings facilitate an improved understanding of noise regulation in event timing. Comment: submitted to American Control Conference 201...|$|R
