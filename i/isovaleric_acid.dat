25|$|Like most toothed whales, {{it has a}} {{compartment}} {{found at}} {{the centre of the}} forehead that contains an organ used for echolocation called a melon, which contains fatty tissue. The shape of the beluga's head is unlike that of any other cetacean, as the melon is extremely bulbous, lobed, and visible as a large frontal prominence. Another distinctive characteristic it possesses is the melon is malleable; its shape is changed during the emission of sounds. The beluga is able to change the shape of its head by blowing air around its sinuses to focus the emitted sounds. This organ contains fatty acids, mainly <b>isovaleric</b> <b>acid</b> (60.1%) and long-chain branched acids (16.9%), a very different composition from its body fat, and which could play a role in its echolocation system.|$|E

2500|$|A {{wine that}} has not been sterilized by {{filtration}} might well still contain live yeast cells and bacteria. If both alcoholic and malolactic fermentation have run to completion, and neither excessive oxygen nor Brettanomyces yeast are present, this ought to cause no problems; modern hygiene has largely eliminated spoilage by bacteria such as acetobacter, which turns wine into vinegar. If there is residual sugar, however, it may undergo secondary fermentation, creating dissolved carbon dioxide as a by-product. When the wine is opened, it will be spritzy or [...] "sparkling". In a wine intended to be still this is regarded as a serious fault; it can even cause the bottle to explode. Similarly, a wine {{that has not}} been put through complete malolactic fermentation may undergo it in bottle, reducing its acidity, generating carbon dioxide, and adding a diacetyl butterscotch aroma. Brettanomyces yeasts add 4-ethylphenol, 4-ethylguaiacol and <b>isovaleric</b> <b>acid</b> horse-sweat aromas. These phenomena may be prevented by sterile filtration, by the addition of relatively large quantities of sulfur dioxide and sometimes sorbic acid, by mixing in alcoholic spirit to give a fortified wine of sufficient strength to kill all yeast and bacteria, or by pasteurization.|$|E

The microorganisms used in experiment were 2 strains of bacteria, Corynebacterium sp. (Cｌ strain: gram positive) and Vibrio sp.

The average molecular weight (Mw) of the purified CT was 2, 081 Da with a protein binding affinity of 0. 69 (the amount needed to bind half the maximum bovine serum albumin). In vitro gas production declined by 0. 409, 0. 121, and 0. 311, respectively, while CH 4 production decreased by 0. 211, 0. 353, and 0. 549, respectively, with addition of 10, 20, and 30 mg CT/ 500 mg dry matter (DM) compared to the control (p< 0. 05).

Cook and Stephenson (1928), using manometric methods, found that glucose was not oxidised by A. faecalis, whereas acetate, formate, pyruvate, and lactate resulted in 02 uptakes corresponding respectively to 75, 100, 60 and 66 per cent of theoretical for complete oxidation. The inability of A. faecais to oxidize glucose was thoroughly examined by Barron and Friedemann (1941) who found that although glueose was not utilized, {{the addition of the}} mono or diphosphate ester to a cellular suspension caused a rapid 02 uptake in a Warburg respirom-eter.
