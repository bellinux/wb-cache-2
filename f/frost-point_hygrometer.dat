40|$|The {{accuracy}} {{of all types}} of Vaisala radiosondes and two types of Snow White chilled-mirror hygrosondes was assessed in an intensive in situ comparison with reference hygrometers. Fourteen nighttime reference comparisons were performed to determine a working reference for the radiosonde comparisons. These showed that the night version of the Snow White agreed best with the references [i. e., the NOAA <b>frost-point</b> <b>hygrometer</b> (FPH) and University of Colorado cryogenic <b>frost-point</b> <b>hygrometer</b> (CFH) ], but that the daytime version had severe problems with contamination in the humid upper troposphere. Since the RS 92 performance was superior to the other radiosondes and to the day version of the Snow White, it was selected to be the working reference. According to the reference comparison, the RS 92 has no bias in the mid- and lower troposphere, with deviations <± 5...|$|E

40|$|Soundings of <b>frost-point</b> <b>hygrometers,</b> ozoneson- des, and radiosondes at San Cristdbal Island (0. 9 øS, 89. 6 øW) in September 1998 {{provide an}} {{observational}} evidence that equatorial Kelvin waves around the tropopause {{act as a}} de- hydration pump for the stratosphere. During the downward- displacement phase of a Kelvin wave, dry and ozone-rich stratospheric air is transported into the upper troposphere. During the upward-displacement phase, on the other hand, higher specific-humidity air moves up in the tropopause re- gion, {{but at the same}} time, this upward motion causes cool- ing of the air that limits the water vapor amount entering the stratosphere. Also, wave breaking contributes to the irreversible transport of ozone across the tropopause. Con- sidering their omnipresence at the equatorial tropopause, we suggest that Kelvin waves {{may be one of the}} impor- tant agents for maintaining the dryness of the tropical lower stratospher...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A new {{instrument}} for in-situ measurements of atmospheric water vapor from aircraft platforms {{has been developed}} based upon near-infrared tunable diode laser sources operating near 1. 37 pm. The spectrometer features an unique open-path, multipass (Herriott) cell for true in-situ monitoring of water vapor concentrations with precision levels exceeding those of Lyman-a and <b>frost-point</b> <b>hygrometers.</b> External sampling outside of the aircraft boundary layer minimizes ambiguities in the measured water vapor abundances. Variable spectrum acquisition rates up to 10 Hz provide fast temporal resolution free from sampling or flow rate limitations. In its current configuration the instrument operates from the right wing pod of the NASA ER- 2 research aircraft, and is optimized for measurements in the upper troposphere and stratosphere (to 20 km). Measurement precision is + 0. 05 ppmv in the stratosphere for a 2 s measurement integration period. The flight-ready i n s t b e n t weight is 18 pounds, and power consumption, exclusive of structural heaters, is 7. 5 W. 1...|$|R
40|$|Water vapor {{and ozone}} {{profiles}} {{in the tropical}} tropopause layer (TTL) are investigated using measurements from balloon-borne <b>frost-point</b> <b>hygrometers</b> and ozone sensors during the Central Equatorial Pacific Experiment campaign. Variations in water vapor, ozone, and temperature are described during soundings taken {{over a period of}} two weeks and over a distance of approximately 2, 700 km along the equator. These observations indicate that the first and latter halves of the campaign period are characterized as cold and warm phases near the cold point tropopause, respectively. Stationary and eastward-traveling components equally contributed to these temperature anomalies. During the transition between the two phases, the ozone increased around 350 – 400 K, with the maxima around the 360 K isentrope. The water vapor simultaneously increased and decreased around the 360 – 400 K and 350 – 360 K isentropes, respectively. Simultaneous increases in ozone and water vapor around 360 – 400 K with a reduction in the vertical gradients suggest the possibility of turbulent mixing associated with a large-scale wave structure. The enhancement of vertical shear of zonal wind during the transition between the two phases also supports this idea. The decrease in water vapor around the 350 – 360 K isentropes could be understood as a result of saturation on the isentropic surface. This study shows the importance of observing variations in isentropic coordinates, rather than altitude coordinates, around the TTL {{in order to make a}} quantitative argument concerning mixing and dehydration when a large-amplitude disturbance exists...|$|R

We reassess the trend from the earliest, the UK <b>frost-point</b> <b>hygrometer,</b> 1954 – 1976. An error in previous work omitted to transform values from ppmm to ppmv. When corrected, they fit more convincingly with measurements by later frost-point hygrometers. Minor instrument changes between the 1950 s and 1970 s do not introduce a potential bias to the trend but do increase its error. If the full 1970 s data are included, the trend becomes 2. 1 ± 0. 8 %/year (two-sigma) ...|$|E
40|$|Conventional frost-point {{hygrometers}} observe frost {{on their}} cold point by optical means [1, 2, 3], thereby requiring several micrometres of ice to form. We {{have developed a}} new hygrometer which uses surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices to determine when condensation has occurred. At the oscillation frequencies used (hundreds of MHz), the SAW device is capable of responding to a few monolayers of condensate, increasing sensitivity and reducing response time.

40|$|Accuracy, precision, {{repeatability}} {{and long-term}} stability, {{are the most}} important requirements to enable reliable airborne humidity measurements, which are needed for climate models or to validate e. g. remote sensing instrumentation like satellites. However, various hygrometer artifacts which depend on the individual sensor principle and the application profile frequently cause problems and significantly complicate the hygrometer choice. Sensor intercomparisons are one way of providing the information for an optimal choice. In this paper we present the first part of a blind, static, laboratory-based intercomparison of a new, calibration-free, 1. 4 μm diode laser-based, optical hygrometer (SEALDH) with the two most important measurement principles for airborne hygrometry (<b>frost-point</b> <b>hygrometers,</b> FPH, and Lyman-alpha fluorescence hygrometers, LAFH). During three days of measurement, the TDL-hygrometer achieved a H 2 O resolution of up to 0. 5 ppmv (Δt= 2 sec) at tropospheric pressure and H 2 O concentration levels (100 – 800 hPa, 10 to 8000 ppmv H 2 O). Its absolute accuracy was investigated via blind intercomparison with two reference FPHs and a LAFH. Without any calibration of SEALDH, i. e. without a comparison to a water vapor standard, we achieve an excellent agreement with the reference sensors, with an average systematic offset (over all three days) of − 3. 9 %± 1. 5 %, which is fully consistent with the sensor’s uncertainty bounds. Further we also reevaluated the SEALDH data of day 2 and 3 in a calibrated mode using an independent set of FPH data from the first day and found an 8 -fold accuracy improvement, yielding an excellent overall relative deviation of only 0. 52 %± 1. 5 % with respect to a LAFH and a D/FH sensor...|$|R
40|$|Tropospheric water-vapour {{and ozone}} measurements, using {{calibrated}} balloon-borne sensors, are reported from the Central Equatorial Pacific Experiment (CEPEX). The sensors were launched from the Research Vessel Vickers along 2 degrees S latitude between 156 degrees E (west {{of the international}} date line) and 155 degrees W (east of the date line). These measurements are combined with those from water-vapour sondes launched over the western Pacific warm pool, during the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA-COARE). Taking the two experiments CEPEX and TOGA-COARE together, the sensors included <b>frost-point</b> <b>hygrometers,</b> Humicap-A Vaisala sondes, Humicap-H Vaisala sondes and electrochemical ozone-sondes. Taken together, the CEPEX and TOGA-COARE data provide over 150 vertical profiles of water vapour within the troposphere in varied conditions of convective activity ranging from disturbed to suppressed. The primary motivation behind the present analyses is to understand the role of tropical deep convection in the vertical distribution of water-vapour. With this in mind, the profiles have been analysed in relation to occasions of recent deep convection and occasions when convection was suppressed. We employ three different criteria to identify the profiles influenced by deep convection brightness temperature in the infrared-window channel of the Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS); ozone as a quasi-conservative tracer for deep convection; and using water vapour itself, that is the wettest versus the driest soundings. Irrespective of the criteria used, we report here that the atmosphere, while {{under the influence of}} active deep convection, was found to have relative humidities in excess of 75 % over most of the troposphere between the surface and about 14 km. The sondes were launched routinely over a period of 45 days (between CEPEX and TOGA-COARE), without biasing the sample towards convectively disturbed conditions. A feature of the convectively disturbed profile is a distinct minimum in relative humidity at about 700 hPa, where it was as low as 65 %. The low relative humidity was accompanied by relatively high ozone mixing ratios, which raises the possibility of long-range transport of dry sub-tropical air into the warm, convectively disturbed, regions of the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Inspection of the analysed fields, and the wind fields from the sondes, supports this assertion. It then follows that the omnipresent minimum of moist static energy and minimum relative humidity at 700 hPa in the inner tropics {{may be the result of}} long-range, inclined, transport of dry air from non-convective regions. This detection suggests a linkage between the large-scale circulation, deep convection and the thermodynamic structure within the equatorial troposphere. The results presented here demonstrate the applicability of ozone as a quasi-conservative tracer of transport in the context of deep convection. The ozone-based criterion is used to diagnose recent deep convection, independent of the GMS satellite observations, and allows one to follow the evolution of relative humidity and of water-vapour mixing ratio after the dissipation of the cloud anvil to optically thin conditions. We show that the troposphere dries to low humidity soon after anvil dissipation. This observation leads to the hypothesis that moistening of the atmosphere, away from the core of Cb convection, occurs by evaporation of precipitation falling out of the anvils. After anvil dissipation, the ensuing subsidence in clear air causes the relative humidity and the water mixing ratio to decrease...|$|R
40|$|Both campaigns {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the capability of}} three Raman lidars for the measurement of water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UT/LS). During each campaign, more than 200 hours of lidar measurements were compared to balloon borne measurements obtained from 10 Cryogenic <b>Frost-point</b> <b>Hygrometer</b> (CFH) flights and over 50 Vaisala RS 92 radiosonde flights. During MOHAVE, fluorescence in all three lidar receivers was identified, causing a significant wet bias above 10 - 12 km in the lidar profiles {{as compared to the}} CFH. All three lidars were reconfigured after MOHAVE, and no such bias was observed during the MOHAVE-II campaign. The lidar profiles agreed very well with the CFH up to 13 - 17 km altitude, where the lidar measurements become noise limited. The results from MOHAVE-II have shown that the water vapor Raman lidar will be an appropriate technique for the long-term monitoring of water vapor in the UT/LS given a slight increase in its power-aperture, as well as careful calibration. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Measurements of Humidity in the Atmosphere and Validation Experiment (MOHAVE) 2009 {{campaign}} {{took place}} on 11 – 27 October 2009 at the JPL Table Mountain Facility in California (TMF).

40|$|For {{almost two}} decades, the {{airborne}} Fast In-situ Stratospheric Hygrometer (FISH) has stood for accurate and precise measurements of total water mixing ratios (WMR, gas phase + evaporated ice) {{in the upper}} troposphere and lower stratosphere (UT/LS). Here, we present {{a comprehensive review of}} the measurement technique (Lyman-α photofragment fluorescence), calibration procedure, accuracy and reliability of FISH. Crucial for FISH measurement quality is the regular calibration to a water vapor reference, namely the commercial <b>frost-point</b> <b>hygrometer</b> DP 30. In the frame of this work this <b>frost-point</b> <b>hygrometer</b> is compared to German and British traceable metrological water standards and its accuracy is found to be 2 – 4 %. Overall, in the range from 4 to 1000 ppmv, the total accuracy of FISH was found to be 6 – 8 %, as stated in previous publications. For lower mixing ratios down to 1 ppmv, the uncertainty reaches a lower limit of 0. 3 ppmv. For specific, non-atmospheric conditions, as set in experiments at the AIDA chamber – namely mixing ratios below 10 and above 100 ppmv in combination with high- and low-pressure conditions – the need to apply a modified FISH calibration evaluation has been identified. The new evaluation improves the agreement of FISH with other hygrometers to ± 10 % accuracy in the respective mixing ratio ranges. Furthermore, a quality check procedure for high total water measurements in cirrus clouds at high pressures (400 – 500 hPa) is introduced. The performance of FISH in the field is assessed by reviewing intercomparisons of FISH water vapor data with other in situ and remote sensing hygrometers {{over the last two decades}}. We find that the agreement of FISH with the other hygrometers has improved over that time span from overall up to ± 30 % or more to about ± 5 – 20 % @ 10 ppmv. As presented here, the robust and continuous calibration and operation procedures of the FISH instrument over the last two decades establish the position of FISH as one of the core instruments for in situ observations of water vapor in the UT/LS...|$|E

In some cases, loss of frost-point control within layers with relative humidity below this detection limit caused inaccurate measurements above these dry layers, where the relative humidity was within the detection range of the instrument.

To illustrate the capability of laser probing technique, we report balloonborne H 2 Oand CH 4 simultaneous measurements obtained on October 2001 atmidlatitudes (43 ° N).

The detection of long term changes in water vapour concentra- tion, particularly in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) is an issue of pressing scientific, ecological and societal concern. The field campaign took place at the University of Western Ontario Environmental Re- search Field Station, near London Ontario Canada, from May 23 rd to June 10 th 2012 and resulted in 57 hours of measurements taken over 12 clear nights.

In this paper we review the stages in the instrumental development, data acquisition and analysis, profile retrieval and calibration procedures of the lidar, as well as selected results from three validation campaigns: MOHAVE (Measurements of Humidity in the Atmosphere and Validation Experiments), MOHAVE-II, and MOHAVE 2009. In particular, one critical result from this latest campaign is the very good agreement (well below the reported uncertainties) observed between the lidar and the Cryogenic <b>Frost-Point</b> <b>Hygrometer</b> in the entire lidar range 3 – 20 km, with a mean bias not exceeding 2 % (lidar dry) in the lower troposphere, and 3 % (lidar moist) in the UTLS.

Since 2005, nearly 1000 profiles have been routinely measured, and since 2009, the profiles have typically reached 14 km for one-hour integration times and 1. 5 km vertical resolution, and can reach 21 km for 6 -h integration times using degraded vertical resolutions. These performance figures show that, with our present target of routinely running our lidar two hours per night, 4 nights per week, we can achieve measurements with a precision in the UTLS equivalent to that achieved if launching one CFH per month...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{potential}} contribution of observed changes in lower stratospheric water vapour to stratospheric temperature variations {{over the past}} three decades using a comprehensive global climate model (GCM). Three case studies are considered. In the first, the net increase in stratospheric water vapour (SWV) from 1980 – 2010 (derived from the Boulder <b>frost-point</b> <b>hygrometer</b> record using the gross assumption that this is globally representative) is estimated to have cooled the lower stratosphere by up to ∼ 0. 2 K decade− 1 in the global and annual mean; this is ∼ 40 % of the observed cooling trend over this period. In the Arctic winter stratosphere there is a dynamical response to the increase in SWV, with enhanced polar cooling of 0. 6 K decade− 1 at 50 hPa and warming of 0. 5 K decade− 1 at 1 hPa. In the second case study, the observed decrease in tropical lower stratospheric water vapour after the year 2000 (imposed in the GCM as a simplified representation of the observed changes derived from satellite data) is estimated to have caused a relative increase in tropical lower stratospheric temperatures by ∼ 0. 3 K at 50 hPa. In the third case study, the wintertime dehydration in the Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex (again using a simplified representation of the changes seen in a satellite dataset) is estimated to cause a relative warming of the Southern Hemisphere polar stratosphere by up to 1 K at 100 hPa from July–October. This is accompanied by a weakening of the westerly winds on the poleward flank of the stratospheric jet by up to 1. 5 m s− 1 in the GCM. The results show that, if the measurements are representative of global variations, SWV should be considered as important a driver of transient and long-term variations in lower stratospheric temperature over the past 30 years as increases in long-lived greenhouse gases and stratospheric ozone depletion...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-performance}} Raman lidar {{operating in}} the UV portion of the spectrum {{has been used to}} acquire, for the first time using a single lidar, simultaneous airborne profiles of the water vapor mixing ratio, aerosol backscatter, aerosol extinction, aerosol depolarization and research mode measurements of cloud liquid water, cloud droplet radius, and number density. The Raman Airborne Spectroscopic Lidar (RASL) system was installed in a Beechcraft King Air B 200 aircraft and was flown over the mid-Atlantic United States during July August 2007 at altitudes ranging between 5 and 8 km. During these flights, despite suboptimal laser performance and subaperture use of the telescope, all RASL measurement expectations were met, except that of aerosol extinction. Following the Water Vapor Validation Experiment Satellite/Sondes (WAVES_ 2007) field campaign in the summer of 2007, RASL was installed in a mobile trailer for groundbased use during the Measurements of Humidity and Validation Experiment (MOHAVE-II) field campaign held during October 2007 at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory s Table Mountain Facility in southern California. This ground-based configuration of the lidar hardware is called Atmospheric Lidar for Validation, Interagency Collaboration and Education (ALVICE). During theMOHAVE-II field campaign, during which only nighttime measurements were made, ALVICE demonstrated significant sensitivity to lower-stratospheric water vapor. Numerical simulation and comparisons with a cryogenic <b>frost-point</b> <b>hygrometer</b> are used to demonstrate that a system with the performance characteristics of RASL ALVICE should indeed be able to quantify water vapor well into the lower stratosphere with extended averaging from an elevated location like Table Mountain. The same design considerations that optimize Raman lidar for airborne use on a small research aircraft are, therefore, shown to yield significant dividends in the quantification of lower-stratospheric water vapor. The MOHAVE-II measurements, along with numerical simulation, were used to determine that the likely reason for the suboptimal airborne aerosol extinction performance during theWAVES_ 2007 campaign was amisaligned interference filter. With full laser power and a properly tuned interference filter,RASL is shown to be capable ofmeasuring themain water vapor and aerosol parameters with temporal resolutions of between 2 and 45 s and spatial resolutions ranging from 30 to 330 m from a flight altitude of 8 km with precision of generally less than 10 %, providing performance that is competitive with some airborne Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) water vapor and High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) aerosol instruments. The use of diode-pumped laser technology would improve the performance of an airborne Raman lidar and permit additional instrumentation to be carried on board a small research aircraft. The combined airborne and ground-based measurements presented here demonstrate a level of versatility in Raman lidar that may be impossible to duplicate with any other single lidar technique...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Measurements of Humidity in the Atmosphere and Validation Experiment (MOHAVE) 2009 {{campaign}} {{took place}} on 11 - 27 October 2009 at the JPL Table Mountain Facility in California (TMF). The main objectives of the campaign were to (1) validate the water vapor measurements of several instruments, including, three Raman lidars, two microwave radiometers, two Fourier-Transform spectrometers, and two GPS receivers (column water), (2) cover water vapor measurements from the ground to the mesopause without gaps, and (3) study upper tropospheric humidity variability at timescales varying from {{a few minutes to}} several days. A total of 58 radiosondes and 20 <b>Frost-Point</b> <b>hygrometer</b> sondes were launched. Two types of radiosondes were used during the campaign. Non negligible differences in the readings between the two radiosonde types used (Vaisala RS 92 and InterMet iMet- 1) made a small, but measurable impact on the derivation of water vapor mixing ratio by the Frost-Point hygrometers. As observed in previous campaigns, the RS 92 humidity measurements remained within 5 % of the Frost-point in the lower and mid-troposphere, but were too dry in the upper troposphere. Over 270 h of water vapor measurements from three Raman lidars (JPL and GSFC) were compared to RS 92, CFH, and NOAA-FPH. The JPL lidar profiles reached 20 km when integrated all night, and 15 km when integrated for 1 h. Excellent agreement between this lidar and the frost-point hygrometers was found throughout the measurement range, with only a 3 % (0. 3 ppmv) mean wet bias for the lidar in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). The other two lidars provided satisfactory results in the lower and mid-troposphere (2 - 5 % wet bias over the range 3 - 10 km), but suffered from contamination by fluorescence (wet bias ranging from 5 to 50 % between 10 km and 15 km), preventing their use as an independent measurement in the UTLS. The comparison between all available stratospheric sounders allowed to identify only the largest biases, in particular a 10 % dry bias of the Water Vapor Millimeter-wave Spectrometer compared to the Aura-Microwave Limb Sounder. No other large, or at least statistically significant, biases could be observed. Total Precipitable Water (TPW) measurements from six different co-located instruments were available. Several retrieval groups provided their own TPW retrievals, resulting in the comparison of 10 different datasets. Agreement within 7 % (0. 7 mm) was found between all datasets. Such good agreement illustrates the maturity of these measurements and raises confidence levels for their use as an alternate or complementary source of calibration for the Raman lidars. Tropospheric and stratospheric ozone and temperature measurements were also available during the campaign. The water vapor and ozone lidar measurements, together with the advected potential vorticity results from the high-resolution transport model MIMOSA, allowed the identification and study of a deep stratospheric intrusion over TMF. These observations demonstrated the lidar strong potential for future long-term monitoring of water vapor in the UTLS...|$|E
