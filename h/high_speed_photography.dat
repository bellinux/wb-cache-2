25|$|Coins {{can also}} be spun {{on a flat surface}} such as a table. This results in the {{following}} phenomenon: as the coin falls over and rolls on its edge, it spins faster and faster (formally, the precession rate of the symmetry axis of the coin, i.e., the axis passing from one face of the coin to the other) before coming to an abrupt stop. This is mathematically modeled as a finite-time singularity – the precession rate is accelerating to infinity, before it suddenly stops, and has been studied using <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>photography</b> and devices such as Euler's Disk. The slowing down is predominantly caused by rolling friction (air resistance is minor), and the singularity (divergence of the precession rate) can be modeled as a power law with exponent approximately −1/3.|$|E

They began work on the film 10 months before filming began to plan out the Manhattan sequence; it was mainly CGI, though some New York location shots were used. The sequence was mainly handled by ILM's San Francisco and Vancouver offices. The Hong Kong time sequence was done mainly by ILM's London office. ILM also created digital doubles {{for many of the}} actors, which were shared with the other vendors. Method Studios, who {{worked on the}} Quantum Realm in Ant-Man, worked on the [...] "magical mystery tour" [...] sequence, with Strange hurtling through various dimensions. The sequence was handled by Method's Los Angeles studio, with their Vancouver studio contributing the opening shot of the sequence. The only shot Method did not work on in the sequence was the one that linked to Dormammu, as Luma Pictures assisted in his creation (they handled his other appearances in the film). Method created 7 dimensions for the sequence: the initial wormhole to the [...] "Speaker Cone"; the Bioluminesce world; the fractals of [...] "soft solid" [...] world; a version of the Quantum Realm; Strange falling through his own eye and Cosmic Scream; the Dark Dimension; and the Shape Shifting realm. The Shape Shifting realm originally had Strange morphing and changing shape, but that was ultimately removed as Derrickson felt the audience needed to see Cumberbatch. Method's Vancouver studio created Strange's car crash, the rooftop training, and the sequence in which Strange experiments with time on an apple in the Kamar-Taj library. The car crash blended the <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>photography</b> and some green screen sequences, with digital assets for both Cumberbatch and the car.

An experimental study was carried out into the effect of fluid properties upon mass transfer coefficients in packed distillation columns. A column consisting of 19 stainless steel discs supported in a vertical row, with each disc {{at right angles to}} its neighbour, was used for this purpose. This assembly was contained in a 1 in. diameter glass tube which allowed observation of the liquid running over the discs. Distillation runs were made with the systems ethanol/water, isopropanol/water, ethanol/benzene and benzene/n-heptane. With surface tension negative mixtures, sprays of droplets were emmitted from the liquid as it ran over the junctions between the discs. The phenomenon was filmed using <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> cine <b>photography.</b> In order to eliminate hydrodynamic effects in droplet formation the surface of a stationary sessile drop supported on a horizontal disc under total reflux conditions was also observed.

40|$|This thesis {{gives an}} account of an {{extensive}} experimental investigation of the operation of a twin roll coater. Two distinct modes of operation are identified: Classical (fullyflooded inlet) and Meniscus (ultra-starved inlet). The former {{has been the subject}} of investigation for a number of years; the latter is less well known and would appear to have escaped the attention of the Coating Community at large prior to the research work reported here being carried out. A detailed description of how the key features of an industrial roll coater can be reproduced using a piece of simple but well designed experimental apparatus, which encapsulates all the necessary elements for an in-depth study of the flow, is presented. Various methods are used to visualise the flow. These include dye injection and novel computerised particle tracking techniques, coupled with state-of-the-art image processing and <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> Video <b>photography.</b> Experiments reveal that the flow associated with the Classical mode of operation is essentially one-dimensional throughout the nip; Meniscus coating flow, on the other hand, is uniquely two-dimensional, containing large vortical structures. Also the pressure distributions are found to be quite distinct. A fully-flooded nip results in a pressure profile which exhibits a characteristic maximum and minimum, while an ultra-starved nip produces one which is linear and entirely sub-ambient. The transformation of the flow from one mode of operation to the other is then considered, a key feature of which is the behaviour of the upstream free surface which movesin to a minimum point and then out again as the flux is reduced, giving a non-singular result, that is, there are two non-dimensional values of the flux for each free surface position. Finally, the subject of instability in roll coating is addressed, for both the Classical and Meniscus regimes.
