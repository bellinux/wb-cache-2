Not all cons depicted are successful, and some episodes focus on the characters dealing with the consequences of their actions. However, even if a con does fail, main characters usually come out on top <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> other...or, at times, nothing is gained but nothing lost, either.|$|E
25|$|Each {{science has}} its own unique sets of {{laboratory}} equipment. In the atmosphere, {{there are many things}} or qualities of the atmosphere that can be measured. Rain, which can be observed, or seen anywhere and anytime {{was one of the first}} atmospheric qualities measured historically. Also, two other accurately measured qualities are wind and humidity. Neither of these can be seen but can be felt. The devices to measure these three sprang up in the mid-15th century and were respectively the rain gauge, the anemometer, and the hygrometer. Many attempts had been made prior to the 15th century to construct adequate equipment to measure the many atmospheric variables. Many were faulty <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> were simply not reliable. Even Aristotle noted this in some of his work as the difficulty to measure the air.|$|E
25|$|The {{second is}} {{evolutionary}} robots. This is a methodology that uses evolutionary computation to help design robots, especially the body form, or motion and behavior controllers. In {{a similar way}} to natural evolution, a large population of robots is allowed to compete <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way,</b> <b>or</b> their ability to perform a task is measured using a fitness function. Those that perform worst are removed from the population and replaced by a new set, which have new behaviors based on those of the winners. Over time the population improves, and eventually a satisfactory robot may appear. This happens without any direct programming of the robots by the researchers. Researchers use this method both to create better robots, and to explore the nature of evolution. Because the process often requires many generations of robots to be simulated, this technique may be run entirely or mostly in simulation, then tested on real robots once the evolved algorithms are good enough. Currently, there are about 10 million industrial robots toiling around the world, and Japan is the top country having high density of utilizing robots in its manufacturing industry.|$|E

25|$|Close to Kirkmuir (previously Laigh Kirkmuir), a farm {{occupied}} by William Mure in 1692, is the Freezeland plantation (previously Fold Park) on the turnpike as {{marked on the}} 1858 OS. Nowadays it is a smallholding without a dwelling house. The origin of the name is unclear, although 'furz' or furs' is old Scots for gorse or whin, however {{the existence of this}} small patch of fenced off land may be linked to the reference in Thomson's 1832 map to a fold, either for sheep or cattle. In 1799 the surrounding field is known as Fold Park. It could have been a pen for strayed stock or be connected with the tolls on the turnpike <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> a 'stell', the Scot's word for a partial enclosure made by a wall or trees, to serve as a shelter for sheep or cattle. A building may have existed here. Kirkmuir was farmed by John Brown (died 21 August 1880, aged 54) and his wife Catherine Anderson (died 27 August 1895, aged 72). James Walker (died 11 December 1926, aged 86) and his wife Mary Woodburn (died 27 April 1899, aged 57) also farmed Kirkmuir. They were all buried in the Laigh Kirk graveyard.|$|E
25|$|Distinct trends exist {{regarding}} conservation development. While many countries' {{efforts to}} preserve species and their habitats have been government-led, {{those in the}} North Western Europe tended to arise out of the middle-class and aristocratic interest in natural history, expressed {{at the level of}} the individual and the national, regional or local learned society. Thus countries like Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, etc. had what we would today term NGOs – in the shape of the RSPB, National Trust and County Naturalists' Trusts (dating back to 1889, 1895 and 1912 respectively) Natuurmonumenten, Provincial Conservation Trusts for each Dutch province, Vogelbescherming, etc. – a long time before there were national parks and national nature reserves. This in part reflects the absence of wilderness areas in heavily cultivated Europe, as well as a longstanding interest in laissez-faire government in some countries, like the UK, leaving it as no coincidence that John Muir, the Scottish-born founder of the National Park movement (and hence of government-sponsored conservation) did his sterling work in the USA, where he was the motor force behind the establishment of such NPs as Yosemite and Yellowstone. Nowadays, officially more than 10 percent of the world is legally protected <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> the other, and in practice, private fundraising is insufficient to pay for the effective management of so much land with protective status.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the success}} of Metal Gear Solid, and to an extent Tenchu and Thief, stealth {{elements}} have become increasingly incorporated by a wide range of video games, with numerous action games since then using stealth elements <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> another. 2002 saw the first installment of the Tom Clancy licensed Splinter Cell series, an attempt at a more realistic game in the vein of Metal Gear. As with Metal Gear, if the player is discovered in Splinter Cell, the guards will often raise a general alarm. This can cause a difficulty spike or even result in automatic mission failure. [...] Splinter Cell was notable for its state of the art graphics, including dynamic lighting and shadows. These effects not only contributed to the atmosphere of the game, but dynamically affected in which areas the player could hide. The 2004 sequel, , added a multiplayer component to the stealth genre.|$|E

2500|$|The primary {{emphasis}} of the Ministry is on [...] "awakening" [...] sinners, that is showing mankind its sinful condition (the total depravity doctrine), and pointing to Christ the Remedy {{for those who are}} convicted of their need (or [...] ) and fully see their lost and helpless condition before God, showing their only hope is found in Jesus Christ. Almost every message sent out by the ministry stresses this <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> other.

2500|$|The Classic of Poetry {{historically}} {{has a major}} place in the Four Books and Five Classics, the canonical works associated with Confucianism. Some pre-Qin dynasty texts, such as the Analects and a recently excavated manuscript from 300 BC entitled [...] "Confucius' Discussion of the Odes", mention Confucius' involvement with the Classic of Poetry but Han dynasty historian Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian was the first work to directly attribute the work to Confucius. Subsequent Confucian tradition held that the Shijing collection was edited by Confucius from a larger 3,000-piece collection to its traditional 305-piece form. This claim is believed to reflect an early Chinese tendency to relate all of the Five Classics <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> another to Confucius, who by the 1st century BC had become the model of sages and was believed to have maintained a cultural connection to the early Zhou dynasty. This view is now generally discredited, as the Zuo zhuan records that the Classic of Poetry already existed in a definitive form when Confucius was just a young child.|$|E
