40|$|The fencing of land {{contributes}} {{significantly to}} the input cost for farmers in South Africa and approximately 240, 000 tons of wire is purchased annually. It is therefore {{in the interest of}} the consumer to ensure they obtain the most durable wire for the application they intend. The effect of environmental conditions on the longevity of wire is a factor that should be borne in mind. In order to advise especially the farming community on the suitability of wire fencing in different climatological areas, the Agricultural Engineering Institute of South Africa (AEI) initiated a long-term atmospheric exposure programme during December 1990. The project objective was to determine the environmental corrosion effect on five different wire types that were available at the time, at six different localities in South Africa. The wire types used comprised steel wire that was light <b>galvanized,</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>galvanized,</b> 95 %/ 5 % zinc/aluminium coated and aluminium coated. A locally produced rust resistant steel wire, with nominally 11 % chromium was also included. This report compares the performance of wires after an eleven-year period. Wire coating thickness and in the case of the rust resisting steel, tensile strength, were compared to 1990 initial measurements. These results are reported in this paper. The marine site was significantly more corrosive on <b>galvanized</b> <b>wire</b> coatings than inland sites. The Galfan coating was deemed the optimum coating...|$|R

50|$|Enhanced oil {{recovery}} {{methods have been}} implemented in the Carabobo oil field to improve the low recovery factors. Along with microbial enhanced {{oil recovery}}, which involves using microorganisms as biosurfactants to reduce the viscosities of the <b>extra</b> <b>heavy</b> crudes, immiscible gas injection, polymer flooding, and in situ combustion, better known as fireflooding, have all been used to improve the recovery {{of oil in the}} field. The advancements in horizontal drilling techniques have led to the use of steam assisted gravity drainage in <b>extra</b> <b>heavy</b> oil reservoirs. Steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) involves drilling two holes, one above the oil and the other below. Steam is then injected into the upper hole, causing the steam to condense and heat the oil. The oil becomes less viscous, and drains into the hole below due to gravity. Using this method, recovery could be as high as 87%, which is a vast improvement over other methods in use for extraction of <b>extra</b> <b>heavy</b> crude oils.|$|R
