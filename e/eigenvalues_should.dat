The {{existence of a}} pressure-sensitive thermal contact resistance at the interface can cause such systems to be unstable in the steady-state. Stability analysis for thermoelastic contact has been conducted by linear perturbation methods for one-dimensional and simple two-dimensional geometries, but analytical solutions become very complicated for finite geometries.

The linearity of the underlying perturbation problem enables us to conclude that solutions can be obtained in separated-variable form with exponential variation in time.

These eigenvalues determine the spatial behavior of Polyakov loop correlations functions. Our results are valid for all values of the gauge coupling in 1 + 1 dimensions, and valid in the strong-coupling region {{for any number of}} dimensions. When the quark chemical potential μ is nonzero, the spatial transfer matrix T_s is non-Hermitian. The appearance of complex eigenvalues in T_s is a manifestation of the sign problem in finite-density QCD. The invariance of finite-density QCD under the combined action of charge conjugation C and complex conjugation K implies that the eigenvalues of T_s are either real or part of a complex pair. Calculation of the spectrum confirms the existence of complex pairs in much of the temperature-chemical potential plane. Many features of the spectrum for static quarks are determined by a particle-hole symmetry. For μ small compared to the quark mass M, we typically find real eigenvalues for the lowest lying states. At somewhat larger values of μ, pairs of eigenvalues may form complex-conjugate pairs, leading to damped oscillatory behavior in Polyakov loop correlation functions. However, near μ=M, the low-lying spectrum becomes real again. This is a direct consequence of the approximate particle-hole symmetry at μ=M for heavy quarks.

When {{the number of}} training samples {{is less than the}} image dimension (total number of pixels), the within-class scatter matrix (Sw) in Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is singular, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is suggested to employ in Fisherface for dimension reduc-tion of Sw so that it becomes nonsingular. The popular method is to select the largest nonzero eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors for LDA. To attenuate the illumination effect, some researchers suggested removing the three eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues and the performance is improved. However, as far as we know, there is no systematic way to determine which <b>eigenvalues</b> <b>should</b> be used. Along this line, this paper proposes a theorem to interpret why PCA can be used in LDA and an automatic and systematic method to select the eigenvectors to be used in LDA using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). A GA-PCA is then developed. It is found that some small eigenvectors should also be used as part of the basis for dimension reduction. Using the GA-PCA to reduce the dimension, a GA-Fisher method is designed and developed. Comparing with the traditional Fish-erface method, the proposed GA-Fisher offers two additional advantages. First, optimal bases for dimensionality reduction are derived from GA-PCA. Second, the computational efficiency of LDA is improved by adding a whitening procedure after dimen-sion reduction. The Face Recognition Technology (FERET) and Carnegie Mellon University Pose, Illumination, and Expression (CMU PIE) databases are used for evaluation. Experimental re-sults show that almost 5 % improvement compared with Fisherface can be obtained, and the results are encouraging.

The specification of the Rotterdam model allows straightforward testing of the basic theoretical properties of demand. Based on theory, a system of demand equations should obey adding up, homogeneity, symmetry, and negativity (Theil 1971, 1975; Deaton and Muellbauer). Adding up is guaranteed or automatically satisfied in the Rotterdam model and other similar demand models like the almost ideal demand system (AIDS). Hence, adding up cannot be tested. Negativity can be checked by calculating the eigenvalues of the Rotterdam Slutsky matrix (all <b>eigenvalues</b> <b>should</b> be nonpositive). The remaining two properties, homogeneity and symmetry, can be straightforwardly tested by using the likelihood ratio test, as in the present paper, or the Wald or Lagrange multiplier tests; homogeneity can also be tested separately for each demand equation using the F-test.

40|$|Resonances {{are often}} treated under the {{assumption}} that they are simple poles of the resolvent kernel (Green’s function). There are no physical or mathematical reasons which exclude the existence of multiple poles of Green’s functions even in the case when the potential is real valued. In this case the poles in the physical sheet are simple since the Schrodinger operator is selfadjoint but the poles on the unphysical sheet are not necessarily simple. We prove that sufftciently small perturbations of the potential (or boundary in diffraction problems) do not increase the multiplicity of the resonances on any fixed compact domain of the complex plane. We also observe that a knowledge of the set of the Green’s function poles does not determine the potential uniquely. Let G(x, y, k) be the Green’s function (resolvent kernel) of the Schrodinger operator with a compactly supported potential. It is proved that G is a meromorphic function of k on the whole complex plane. Its poles in the half-plane Im k < 0 are called resonances.
