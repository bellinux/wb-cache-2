40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{examine how the}} {{traditional}} results of the microfinance literature change under the project divisibility assumption. We show that, under standard debt contracts, loan size and borrower profits are unchanged when lending to uncollateralized borrowers with an individual lending or with a group lending/joint liability scheme, as {{the positive effect of}} the latter on bank risk is offset by a negative effect on borrowers’ optimal loan size. We also show that participated (debt plus profit sharing) loan contracts which reduce the lending rate (with respect to standard debt contracts) generate higher loan size and output, but lower borrower profits. Such contracts, however, cannot be enforced in presence of ex post hidden information, unless costly state verification by the lender is possible and economically convenient. We finally show that a problem of borrower heterogeneity may be solved by the lender with a participated loan/group lending scheme since, in this case, it is possible to devise a menu of contracts discriminating among heterogeneous quality groups. In such case we show that, under reasonable parametric conditions, a participated loan/group lending contract ensures higher profits to the <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>borrower</b> than a standard debt individual lending contract...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of private {{information about a}} firm can affect the competition among potential lenders. In the Sharpe (1990) model of information asymmetry among lenders (with the von Thadden (2004) correction), an uninformed outside bank faces a winner’s curse when competing with an informed inside bank. This paper examines the model’s prediction for observed interest rates at an inside vs. outside bank. Although the outside bank wins more bad firms than the inside bank, the winner’s curse also causes the outside rate conditional on firm type to be lower in expectation than the inside rate conditional on firm type. I show analytically that the expected interest rate at the outsider can be either higher or lower than the expected interest rate at the insider, depending on the net of these two effects. Under {{the assumption that the}} banks split the firms in a tie bid, a numerical solution shows that the outside expected interest rate is higher than the inside expected interest rate for <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>borrower</b> pools, but the outside expected interest rate is lower for low quality borrower pools.

40|$|When {{an inside}} lender has private {{information}} about a firm, there is an information asymmetry among lenders. The effect of this asymmetry on the relative rates for firms borrowing from an insider or outsider is not well established. In the Sharpe (1990) model, an inside lender with private information competes against an outside lender with public information. In a correction to the model, von Thadden (2004) shows {{that there is no}} pure-strategy equilibrium due to the “winner’s curse. ” Because the outsider must compensate for the winner’s curse to break even, one might expect outsider rates to be higher than insider rates. However, due to the winner’s curse, the expected interest rates for each firm type are higher at the inside lender. In this paper, I show analytically that the inside rate can be either higher or lower depending on the parameter space. This result is limited because it depends somewhat on an assumption about which lender wins {{in the event of a}} tie bid. Under the assumption that the lenders split the firms in a tie bid, an analytical solution shows that the inside (outside) rate is higher for low (<b>high)</b> <b>quality</b> <b>borrower</b> pools. A numerical analysis further investigates the parameter space where the outside rate is higher than the inside rate. The results show that the magnitude of the difference between the outside and inside rate is greatest for borrower pools in which the probability of success for a good firm is significantly higher than the probability of success for the average firm...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the choice between conduit loans and traditional whole loans in commercial mortgages. The author compares conduit and whole loan programs, and discusses their differences {{and the effects of}} information technology on the mortgage choice problem. Conduit lending produces a more volatile source of funding in posted loan rates and more stability in terms of capital availability. The specific loan program characteristics associated with conduit lending are the greater ease of accessing loan program information, faster loan closing and broader selection. The longer-run implications are that <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> <b>borrowers</b> will eventually disintermediate mortgage brokers due to improvements in information technology. This suggests that there will be fewer brokers working more efficiently with a larger number of borrowers. Consequently, deep as opposed to broad service provision is the inevitable result of advancing information technology and internet-based transactions. ...|$|R
40|$|Information {{advantage}} and entry deterrence incentives are investigated as they affect lending outcomes and competitive {{structure of the}} U. S. residential mortgage market. In the model, when assessing a loan applicant, the incumbent monopoly lender employs a proprietary screening technology to produce a privately observed estimate of loan credit quality. When faced with potential competitive entry, the incumbent signals poor credit <b>quality</b> by charging <b>high</b> prices to <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> <b>borrowers.</b> Market structure and loan pricing strategy are derived endogenously, where the incumbent deters entry by first segmenting consumers into prime and sub-prime loan markets and second by charging prime market borrowers a uniform rate that {{is higher than the}} risk-based monopoly rate. Empirical implications of the model are identified, and evidence is presented that is consistent with predictions. 1 The U.

40|$|We use {{data from}} credit report and deeds records to better {{understand}} the extent to which second liens contributed to the housing crisis by allowing buyers to purchase homes with small down payments. At the top of the housing market second liens were quite prevalent, with as many as 45 percent of home purchases in coastal markets and bubble locations involving a piggyback second lien. Owner-occupants were more likely to use piggyback second liens than investors. Second liens in the form of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) were originated to relatively <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>borrowers</b> and originations were declining near the peak of the housing boom. By contrast, characteristics of closed end second liens (CES) were worse on all these dimensions. Default rates of second liens are generally {{similar to that of the}} first lien on the same home, although HELOCs perform better than CES. About 20 to 30 percent of borrowers will continue to pay their second lien for more than a year while remaining seriously delinquent on their first mortgage. By comparison, about 40 percent of credit card borrowers and 70 percent of auto loan borrowers will continue making payments a year after defaulting on their first mortgage. Finally, we show that delinquency rates on second liens, especially HELOCs, have not declined as quickly as for most other types of credit, raising a potential concern for lenders with large portfolios of second liens on their balance sheet...|$|R

40|$|Researchers and {{practitioners}} {{have begun to}} investigate and adopt credit default models for practical applications. As a result, {{the issue of the}} accuracy of probability estimates has naturally arisen. Specifically, users of a default model that produces estimates of probabilities of default desire to know the accuracy of the probabilities produced by the model. There are a number of mechanisms for doing this, but one that has found favor due to its intuitive appeal is the estimation of goodness of fit between expected (under a particular hypothesis) and predicated default rates. While most experimenters readily acknowledge that large data sets are required to test these estimates, particularly when probabilities are small {{as in the case of}} <b>higher</b> credit <b>quality</b> <b>borrowers,</b> the question of how large often arises. In this short note we demonstrate, based on simple statistical relationships, how a lower bound on the size of a sample may be calculated for such experiments. It is a lower bound as it assumes no positive correlation among the data either in time or cross-sectionally, when in practice both of these assumptions are typically violated. In the presence of correlation, the bound can change considerably and we show this. That said, the bound is useful in that it can be helpful in determining when the data at hand are not sufficient to draw rigorous conclusions about th...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of {{accounting}} quality on financial contracting by examining the price and non-price features of loan contracts {{at the time of}} loan origination. <b>Borrower</b> accounting <b>quality,</b> measured using standard models of unsigned abnormal accruals, has a significant economic impact on the loan contract terms. Lower accounting <b>quality</b> <b>borrowers</b> face substantially <b>higher</b> loan spreads (17 to 23 percent higher than the average interest cost).

5000|$|Before {{we go on}} {{discussing}} those studies, it {{is interesting}} to note that the first paper to treat credit rationing as a possible equilibrium phenomenon caused by adverse selection was by Dwight Jaffee and Thomas Russell in 1976. In their model, low <b>quality</b> <b>borrowers</b> would like to [...] "masquerade" [...] as <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> in order to get lower rates, and a separating equilibrium (that is, with different contracts offered to the two types) entails lower rates, but also lower loans, for the high types. This approach did not become popular however, as the pooling equilibrium (both types offered the same contract), which implies credit rationing, is not sustainable; a pooling contract offered to both types that will be accepted by both types and give non-negative profits to the banks can be dominated (generate higher profits) by a contract with lower interest and loan amount, which will only be preferred by the <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> types, who will drop the pooling contract, making it unprofitable for the banks. So focus has shifted on applications that allow for stable equilibrium rationing.|$|R

40|$|Securitization as a {{financial}} instrument has had an extremely {{significant impact on the}} world's financial system. First, by integrating capital markets and the uses of resources - such as mortgage originators, finance companies, governments, etc. - it has strengthened the trend towards disintermediation. Having been able to mitigate agency costs, it has made lending more efficient; evidence of this can be observed in the mortgage markets. By permitting firms to originate and hold assets off the balance sheet, it has generated much higher levels of leverage and, though arguably, greater economies of scale. Combination of securitization techniques with credit derivatives and risk transfer devices continues to develop innovative methods of transforming risk into a commodity and allow various market participants to tap into sectors which were otherwise not open to them. In its broadest sense, the term "securitization" implies a process by which {{a financial}} relationship is converted into a transaction. A financial transaction is the coming together of two or more entities; a financial relationship is their staying together. For example, a loan to a corporation is a financial relationship; once the loan is transformed into a tradable bond, it is a transaction. We find several examples {{in the history of the}} evolution of finance of relationships that have been converted into transactions. The creation of "stock," representing ownership in a corporation, is one of the earliest and most important examples of this process because of its impact on the growth of the corporate form of business organization. The process of converting loans to corporations of <b>high</b> credit <b>quality</b> corporate <b>borrowers,</b> and in the 1970 s expanding that opportunity to speculative-grade corporate borrowers, into publicly traded bonds is another example of this.
