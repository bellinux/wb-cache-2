5|$|In the lead-up to the visit, the American Friends of Vietnam (AFV) {{engaged in}} a promotional {{campaign}} encouraging newspapers to cover Diệm's visit and imploring them to give the South Vietnamese president favourable coverage. The AFV also drafted many of Diệm's speeches, making sure that there were analogies made between South Vietnam and various events in American history, so that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> good impression on the American public and decision-makers. For this purpose they employed the services of the political consultancy firm Harold Oram.|$|E
5|$|Once he was {{sufficiently}} recovered Cragh undertook {{a pilgrimage to}} Hereford, accompanied by Lord and Lady Briouze, to thank Cantilupe for restoring his life. He walked barefoot on the three-day trip, wearing the rope he had been hanged with around his neck. The rope was left at Cantilupe's shrine, after which Cragh said that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> pilgrimage to the Holy Land, although there is some doubt {{as to whether he}} subsequently even left Wales. Jussi Hanska has suggested that Cragh may have invented the pilgrimage story to escape from his companions.|$|E
5|$|Brassey had {{considerable}} skill in choosing good men {{to work in}} this way and in delegating the work. Having taken on a contract at an agreed price <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> suitable sum of money available to the agent to meet the costs. If the agent were able to fulfil the work {{at a lower cost}} he could keep the remainder of the money. If unforeseen problems arose and these were reasonable, Brassey would cover these additional costs. He used hundreds of such agents. At the peak of his career, for well over 20 years, Brassey was employing on average some 80,000 people in many countries in four continents.|$|E

5|$|Neetu Chandra, {{who worked}} with Kumar on Yavarum Nalam (2009), made a cameo {{appearance}} in the film. Nagarjuna's sister Supriya told the media that a few other actors also made cameo appearances in the film. Rashi Khanna confirmed in early April 2014 that she too would make such an appearance. Kumar convinced Nagarjuna to let Akhil make a cameo appearance {{towards the end of}} the film or in a special song. However an official confirmation was originally unavailable. Amitabh Bachchan posted in his official blogging site on 27 April 2014 that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> quick cameo appearance in the film which would be his debut in Telugu cinema. Lavanya Tripathi also made a cameo appearance on Kumar's request. Akhil made a cameo towards the film's end, as he did not want to miss a chance of sharing the screen with his grandfather.|$|E
5|$|As a teenager, Southall had {{unsuccessful}} trials at Wrexham, Crewe Alexandra and Bolton Wanderers. He {{aspired to}} be a postman, and never believed that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> living playing football. He then worked as a binman, waiter and hod carrier and therefore entered the game relatively late. He played for Llandudno Town at age 15, before joining Northern Premier League side Bangor City on £10 a week as a semi-professional the following year. Bangor manager Dave Elliott regularly selected veteran goalkeeper Peter Eales ahead of Southall. Everton asked Elliot permission to take Southall on trial, but Elliot left the club shortly after and no trial took place. With Bangor in financial trouble the paid playing staff began to leave the club, and Southall left Bangor {{and went on to}} accept an offer of £3 a week to play for Conwy United. He moved on to Cheshire County League club Winsford United at the age of 20. The club won the Cheshire Senior Cup in 1980, and Southall was voted the club's Player of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Drogba came on as a {{substitute}} for Anelka against Manchester United in the Community Shield, but could not help prevent Chelsea from succumbing to a 3–1 loss. However, he started the Premier League season in fine form, continuing from where he left off {{on the last day of}} the previous campaign as he scored a hat-trick against West Bromwich Albion in a 6–0 victory. In Chelsea's next game against Wigan Athletic at the DW Stadium, Drogba made three assists in another 6–0 win. Drogba also played the next game at home against Stoke City where he played the whole 90 minutes and scored his fourth Premier League goal of the season when he kicked home a penalty after Nicolas Anelka was brought down by Thomas Sørensen inside the box. On 7 November 2010, Drogba missed the first half of Chelsea's 2–0 defeat by Liverpool. It was later revealed that he had been suffering from malaria for at least a month. He had first complained of feeling unwell before the October 2010 international break but the illness was only diagnosed on 8 November 2010. Having diagnosed the problem, Chelsea insisted that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> full recovery within days.|$|E

5|$|Favre led the Packers to a 13–3 {{regular season}} record, the NFC North championship, {{and the second}} seed in the NFC playoffs. Prior to the Packers' playoff game against the Seattle Seahawks, Favre stated his desire to {{continue}} playing football for another season. In the Divisional Playoffs, Favre threw three touchdowns as the Packers cruised to a 42–20 victory over the Seahawks at a snowy Lambeau Field. The Packers' season ended the following week when they suffered a 23–20 overtime loss in the NFC Championship Game to the eventual Super Bowl Champion New York Giants. Negotiating sub-zero temperatures, Favre amassed 236 passing yards and two touchdowns, but also threw an interception in overtime that set up the Giants' game-winning field goal. Favre's 90-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Donald Driver {{in the second quarter}} was the longest pass in Packers playoff history, and it extended Favre's NFL record for consecutive postseason games with a touchdown pass to 18. Favre stated after the game that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> decision more quickly than he has in the past regarding whether he would return for another season.|$|E

25|$|Luciani {{was summoned}} to Rome for the {{conclave}} to elect the new pope. Luciani was not considered papabile at the time though mentioned upon occasion in several papers, but a few cardinals approached him with their opinion that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> fine pontiff. The electors did not want a Curial figure, as Paul VI had been, but a warm and pastoral figure like Pope John XXIII.|$|E
25|$|Macmillan's {{government}} lost {{a series}} of by-elections in 1962, and was shaken by the Profumo affair in 1963. In October 1963, {{on the eve of}} the annual Conservative Party Conference, Macmillan fell ill with what was initially feared to be inoperable prostate cancer. His doctors assured him that it was benign, and that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> full recovery, but he took the opportunity to resign on the grounds of ill-health. He was succeeded by Home, who campaigned on Britain's nuclear deterrent in the 1964 election. While unimportant in the minds of the electorate, it was an issue on which Home felt passionately, and the majority of voters supported his position. Home narrowly lost the election to Harold Wilson.|$|E

25|$|The {{strain of}} this period, serving as both ACTU President and Labor Party President, {{took its toll}} on Hawke and in 1979 he {{suffered}} a physical collapse. This shock led Hawke to publicly announce his alcoholism in a television interview, and that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> concerted – and ultimately successful – effort to overcome it. He was helped through this period by the relationship that he had established with writer Blanche d'Alpuget, who, in 1982, published a biography of Hawke. His popularity with the public was, if anything, enhanced by this period of rehabilitation, and opinion polling suggested {{that he was a}} far more popular public figure than either Labor Leader Bill Hayden or Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser.|$|E
25|$|O'Neal is also {{an active}} {{businessman}} and investor. He was an active bond investor in the early 1990s but continued to wade into stocks and made investments in various companies such as General Electric, Apple, and PepsiCo. He described what has worked best for him in stock investing was where he felt a personal connection with the company. He has also been an active real estate entrepreneur. O'Neal was looking to expand his business ventures with real-estate development projects aimed at assisting Orlando home owners facing foreclosure. His plans involved buying the mortgages {{of those who had}} fallen into foreclosure and then selling the homes back to them under more affordable terms. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> small profit in return, but wanted to make an investment in Orlando and help out homeowners.|$|E
25|$|Old Owl however, took a {{liking to}} the fearless Neighbors.

The war party with Neighbors, who felt this {{was no time to}} decline, went to Mexico, where Neighbors attempted to buy beef on credit to feed the warriors. When the Mexicans declined to sell beef to a Republic of Texas official on credit, Old Owl told them two beeves were to be forthcoming immediately, or the hacienda would be burned down and every living being killed. This proved highly effective, and the food was immediately forthcoming.|$|E
