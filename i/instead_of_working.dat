5|$|The lay {{attendees}} at Tinh Xa Trung Tam {{are predominantly}} female by {{a ratio of}} around 5 to 1, {{and most of the}} temple-goers are over 40. Most of the younger lay disciples are relatives of regular, older attendees. In addition to local residents, who make up the bulk of the disciples, some are from other parts of Vietnam, as well as overseas Vietnamese who are temporarily in the country. According to the American professor of Vietnamese history and religion Mark W. McLeod, who did fieldwork at Tịnh Xá Trung Tâm, he did not survey the laypeople about their income, for fear of embarrassing them, but conjectured that most had an above average income as they were able to devote a considerable amount of time to organized religious activity <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> longer hours. A regular occurrence at the temple is the weekly Bát Quan Trai Giới (Eight Precepts Ritual). As part of this, the participants take on three additional vows apart from the Five Precepts and stay at the temple for a 24-hour period. These vows prohibit adornments such as makeup and jewellery, the use of comfortable beds and chairs, and eating impurely. During the retreat day, meals are taken in silence and talking is avoided, apart from during dharma talks, sutra chanting and religious debate. Meditation is also a part of the routine. Tinh Xa Trung Tam holds the Eight Precepts Ritual more often than any other institution in the city; the next most frequent temple holds the retreat once every two weeks. Dharma talks are held weekly by the resident monks and nuns, which is generally more frequent than at other places in the city. The disciples and monks at the temple told McLeod that they chose Tinh Xa Trung Tam because of what they regarded as a higher level of discipline, rigor and scholarship at the institution. The monks are transported by their disciples as they are forbidden to drive.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we examine the {{economic}} incentives to work for persons receiving benefits in Norway. We take into account how the tax- and benefit systems interact. For {{a large part of}} the population social security transfers ensure that the income if not working is far from zero. These benefits are typically curtailed if a person works. By including this benefit loss in the tax measure we compute what we call “total” tax rates for all benefit claimants in Norway. We estimate that benefit receivers on average would gain about 70 000 NOK if <b>working</b> full-time <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> not <b>working</b> at all. The total tax rate is about 70 percent for full-time work. About 4 percent will be economically worse off if <b>working</b> full-time <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> not <b>working</b> at all. In addition we find that the tax reform intended to improve economic efficiency by cutting the highest marginal taxes, will worsen the economic incentives for benefit receivers if the lower top-rates are financed by higher taxes at lower incomes. Instead we indicate that reforms making the overall progressivity of the formal tax system stronger would improve the incentives to work for these groups.

In the film, Balian's father, a fictional character named Godfrey the Baron of Ibelin (played by Liam Neeson), returns to Europe to find Balian, his long-lost illegitimate son, who is a blacksmith in France, and encourages him to come to the Holy Land as his heir. Balian is portrayed as having a love affair with Sibylla (this is possibly derived from the Old French Continuation of William of Tyres claims about her and Baldwin). The film depicts Balian as the sole commander of the defence of Jerusalem, and <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> in close alliance with Patriarch Eraclius, Balian is depicted as his rival.
