5|$|Caligari had its Los Angeles premiere at Miller's Theater on 7 May 1921, but {{the theatre}} {{was forced to}} pull it due to demonstrations by protestors. However, the protest was {{organized}} by the Hollywood branch of the American Legion due to fears of unemployment stemming from the import of German films into America, not over objections {{to the content of}} Caligari itself. After running in large commercial theatres, Caligari began to be shown in smaller theatres and film societies <b>in</b> <b>major</b> <b>cities.</b> Box office figures were not regularly published in the 1920s, so it has been difficult to assess the commercial success or failure of Caligari in the United States. Film historians Kristin Thompson and David B. Pratt separately studied trade publications from the time in an attempt to make a determination, but reached conflicting findings; with Thompson concluding it was a box office success and Pratt concluding it was a failure. However, both agreed it was more commercially successful <b>in</b> <b>major</b> <b>cities</b> than in theatres in smaller communities, where tastes were considered more conservative.|$|E

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comObjective: To investigate time trends in dental service provision by location. Design: Five cross-sectional surveys across a 20 -year period. Setting: Australian private general dental practice. Participants: A random sample of dentists. Methods: Mailed questionnaires were collected in 1983, 1988, 1993, 1998 and 2003 (response rates 71 – 76 %). Main outcome measures: Annual services per dentist. Results: Decreases {{in the provision of}} restorative services, and increases in diagnostic and preventive services, occurred <b>in</b> <b>major</b> <b>city</b> locations but not in other locations. While decreases over time were observed in extraction rates <b>in</b> both <b>major</b> <b>city</b> and other locations, higher extraction rates persisted outside of <b>major</b> <b>city</b> locations. Denture and endodontic services fluctuated over time <b>in</b> both <b>major</b> <b>city</b> and other locations, with no difference by location observed in 2003 – 2004. No changes over time were observed for crown and bridge services, but crown and bridge services remained higher <b>in</b> <b>major</b> <b>city</b> compared with other locations in 2003 – 2004. Conclusions: While the overall content of dentist workloads has changed to include less emphasis on removal and replacement of teeth and more effort on diagnosis and prevention aimed at retention of natural dentitions, a gap by location remains, with dentist workloads outside of <b>major</b> <b>city</b> locations marked by higher rates of tooth extraction and lower rates of preventive services.

However, where Estes {{planned to use}} the network of conservative churches in the city, many members were discouraged from working with {{him because he was}} a Mormon. The tone of the advertising for the campaign was more dire than in Miami; ads claimed homosexuals were responsible for half the murders and suicides <b>in</b> <b>major</b> <b>cities</b> and half the cases of syphilis. Perhaps the most significant factor of the campaign was Estes' co-chair, a police officer named Dennis Falk.
