5000|$|Cell Sense: is a <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>tracer</b> agent used {{to safely}} and {{efficiently}} label cells ex vivo {{without the use}} of transfection agents. Labeled cells are transplanted into the patient enabling researchers and clinicians to non-invasively track the administration and migration of therapeutic and/or diagnostic cells using 19F MRI or MRS. Applications include tracking cells in immunotherapy or regenerative medicine as well as diagnosis of inflammatory sites by tracking selected populations of immune cells. Investigators can quantify the number of labeled cells in a user-specified region of interest. It is expected that in vivo cellular imaging will routinely be used to provide a surrogate biomarker for certain cell therapy and drug trials.|$|E
40|$|Fluorocarbon {{compounds}} {{have potential}} value as hydrologic tracers. The compounds are easily detectable in small amounts, and background hydrologic concentrations are usually small. This thesis documents soil column studies which {{were designed to}} test the mobility of fluorocarbon compounds in a controlled saturated flow regime. The fluorocarbon compounds were passed, in aqueous solutions, through columns filled with Ottowa sand, Yolo sandy loam, and crushed coal. Salt tracers were used as control substances. The <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>tracer</b> effluent concentrations were compared to the salt tracer effluent concentrations so that relative tracer mobilities could be analyzed. In all tests, the fluorocarbon tracers exhibited delayed breakthrough characteristics. Delays were least in the Ottowa sand, significant in the Yolo sandy loam, and severe in the crushed coal. Longitudinal dispersion coefficients (D(L)) were calculated for the various tests. <b>Fluorocarbon</b> <b>tracer</b> D(L) values averaged 3. 9 {{times higher than the}} salt tracer D(L) values. Distribution coefficient analysis yielded <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>tracer</b> values that averaged 8. 0 times the salt tracer values. Nonspecific electrical phenomena probably caused the <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>tracer</b> delays, and related parameters such as polarizability and aqueous solubility are speculated to be predictive parameters for qualitatively determining fluorocarbon delay times...|$|E
40|$|This project brought {{together}} NCAS (National Centre for Atmospheric Science) scientists to study atmospheric chemical processes, and particularly those affecting atmospheric aerosol, in London {{by using the}} following sampling platforms: • the BT tower at an elevation of 170 metres above ground level. • adjacent Regents Park where ground level measurements were made. • Marylebone Road at roadside in the street canyon. Two air sampling campaigns were carried out throughout the months of October 2006 and October/November 2007. The objectives of the two campaigns were: 1. To understand the fate of traffic-generated nano-particles in the urban atmosphere 2. To determine fluxes of trace gases and particles above central London 3. To use the vertical and horizontal separation of sampling sites to study the evolution of chemical composition and physical properties of particles 4. To study the chemical properties and formation mechanisms of major components of airborne particles (especially nitrogen-containing) A {{wide range of measurements}} were taken including: REPARTEE I (2006) • Particle and gas fluxes were measured at the elevated site (AMS, CPC, GRAEGOR, O 3, SO 2, NOx, CO, CO 2) • Real time chemical composition of aerosol by particle mass spectrometry at the park (AMS, ATOFMS). • 24 -hours size resolved PM chemical composition with MOUDI and Partisol at the park and at the tower. • Size distribution of particulate matter with SMPS and APS in order to describe the evolution of the traffic component vertically and horizontally at the 3 sites. • <b>Fluorocarbon</b> <b>tracer</b> sampler release from the park REPARTEE II (2007) The REPARTEE I results added some more objectives, addressed with additional instrumentation deployed during the REPARTEE II: • LIDAR, deployed near the road site in order to to describe the atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) structure. • NO 3 /N 2 O 5 CEAS system at the tower in order to elucidate the nitrate chemistry. • Nano-SMPS at the tower in order to monitor the fate of the nano particles. An overview of the 3 monitoring sites, including instrumentation used, method of aerosol sampling will be presented together with an overview of results.

40|$|A {{major problem}} {{associated}} with monitoring {{the velocity of}} water in unsaturated porous media is the difficulty of removing samples of the pore water at different times for analysis. A possible {{solution to this problem}} is to use volatile <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>tracers</b> which are transported in a soluble form, yet can be measured in a gaseous state, thus eliminating the difficult process of extracting liquid samples from soils with high matric suction. The three <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>tracers</b> used to investigate the suitability of a volatile tracer method were bromochlorodifluoromethane, chlorodifluoroethane and sulfur hexafluoride. Five laboratory column experiments were conducted to determine under what conditions volatile tracers would give reliable estimates of water flow rates. The Discrete State Compartment computer model was used to interpret the laboratory data, thereby allowing a more accurate estimate of water travel times in unsaturated media...|$|R
40|$|The {{advantages}} of fluorocarbons {{for use as}} groundwater tracers are reviewed along with their appropriate physical properties and two analytic techniques using gas chromatography. Field tests were conducted in both Aurora, Nebraska and Stanton, Texas using multiple <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>tracers.</b> Laboratory column tests were also done using sand as the stationary phase at low pressure and flow rate. The laboratory peak arrival order was different from that seen in the field tests. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain sorbtion behavior and several are applied to the data gathered here. Aquifer characteristics that may influence tracer retention are identified as mineralogy, organic content, and hydrophobicity of aquifer materials...|$|R
