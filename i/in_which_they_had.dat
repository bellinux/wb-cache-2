5|$|Australia {{was based}} in Peoria, Arizona—the site of the Seattle Mariners spring {{training}} camp—for their preparation for the formal start of their 2009 campaign. Unlike 2006, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> one exhibition game, they competed against three different Major League clubs: the Seattle Mariners, the Milwaukee Brewers and the Chicago White Sox. Their game against Seattle was Ken Griffey, Jr.'s first game playing for the Mariners since October 1999, and was also their first victory {{as part of a}} World Baseball Classic tour.|$|E

5|$|In the 12 {{previous}} matches {{between the}} two sides – four Test matches and eight ODIs – England had a 100% winning record against Bangladesh, the only international team able to boast such a record. The previous year, Bangladesh had claimed their first Test series victory against a senior Test nation, though it came against a West Indies side that was heavily weakened because of an industrial dispute. England came into the tour {{on the back of a}} two-and-a-half-month series against South Africa <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> tied the Test and Twenty20 International series, and secured a 2–1 ODI series win.|$|E

Urban birds are more likely to demonstrate this behavior.

5|$|A {{month and}} a half after Joaquim Inácio's marriage, Emperor PedroI abdicated and sailed to Europe. Since the former emperor's son and heir Dom PedroII was a minor, a regency was formed, and {{more than a decade of}} {{instability}} and turmoil ensued. On 6 October 1831, navy artillerymen, held under suspicion of plotting a mutiny, escaped the presiganga (prison ship) <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been confined. Joaquim Inácio commanded the schooner Jaguaripe which, along with other vessels, had been guarding the prison ship. Seeing that the artillerymen had set sail for Rio de Janeiro, Joaquim Inácio and a few men took a boat to warn the city. They encountered musket fire from the artillerymen, who then changed course for the nearby Ilha das Cobras (Island of the Snakes) in the face of strong opposition from the mainland. They were defeated the next day when three columns of men from the Volunteer Soldier-Officers Battalion and Permanent Municipal Guard Corps invaded the island.|$|E
5|$|Another {{design was}} {{requested}} of Brine, {{but this time}} for a smaller and less expensive building. In 1818, the Keys purchased the building <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> formerly met, moving the library to the Grammar School. The new plans were agreed upon by all concerned, but there continued to be disagreements between the British Treasury department and the Keys over how to fund the project. The Treasury believed that the cost should be covered by Manx taxes, but the Keys argued that this tax would be excessive. The two parties eventually each agreed to pay some of the £1039-10-0d cost, and the project was approved on 31 May 1819, just under 30 {{years after the first}} discussions. The building was completed in less than two years, and the Keys started using the building in January 1821.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{went into}} the match as the champions of their {{respective}} countries – {{the first time that}} the final had been contested by domestic champions since 1999, when Manchester United beat Bayern Munich 2–1 at Barcelona's home, the Camp Nou – both winning with games to spare. Manchester United won their 11th Premier League title with a 0–0 draw at home to Arsenal on 16 May, while Barcelona were confirmed as La Liga champions for the first time in three years when Real Madrid lost to Villarreal on the same day. Both Manchester United and Barcelona were also looking for another Champions League title to cap a season <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> won multiple trophies: Manchester United had already won four out of a possible seven trophies in 2008–09 and were playing for the possibility of becoming the third team to retain the European Double (the domestic league and the European Cup), while Barcelona were aiming to become the first Spanish club to win a Treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Norman broke a hip and {{her health}} began to decline. Although she {{had promised to}} live until 2001, her deteriorating {{condition}} made her followers suspect she would die before then, causing them some distress and denial. In an attempt to help her recover, students used past-life regression to recall interactions with her, and some became very emotional after experiencing memories of events <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> rejected and hurt her. Norman returned to leading services in February 1989, making a quicker than expected recovery, which was attributed to the past-life rituals. After a period of good health, her condition again deteriorated, prompting students to resume recounting their past crimes. Norman lost most of her hearing and experienced chronic pain; she was admitted {{to a hospital in}} December 1989, but by the summer she was well enough to be present at events. She was nearly bedridden in her last years and was attended to by some followers. In 1991, she stated that the Space Brothers had given her permission to die before their expected arrival in 2001.|$|E
5|$|In June 2004 he was {{appointed}} to his first managerial post, taking charge of Dundalk, who were also the first club in Gannon's professional playing career. The side finished sixth in the League of Ireland First Division in the 2004 season. On 14 November 2005, Gannon confirmed his resignation from Dundalk after his position had been called into question as his chief supporters, vice-chairman Tom Baldwin and chief executive Sean Connolly, left the club. This left Dundalk without a manager for their final match of the 2005 season, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> already secured a comfortable mid-table position in Ireland's second tier of association football. Prior to Gannon's departure, the team had drawn ten consecutive matches.|$|E
5|$|One day, while {{travelling}} {{around the}} city with his police officer-friend Balaji, Jagadish witnesses the explosion of a bus <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> travelled. He manages to capture the man who laid the bomb, but he escapes from the hospital where he was kept under custody. Jagadish captures the bomber again, and also forces the police officer who helped the bomber's escape, to commit suicide. Jagadish soon learns that the bomber is a mere executor, a sleeper agent, whose only role was to plant the bomb. He also discovers that the Islamic terrorist group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, which the bomber belongs to, has planned various such attacks in the city {{in a couple of}} days. Enlisting the help of his fellow army men and Balaji, Jagadish manages to thwart these attacks and kill the sleeper cell leader's brother and eleven other terrorists, including the previously captured sleeper agent.|$|E

5|$|Saint and Dayuma, in {{conjunction}} with SIL, negotiated {{the creation of an}} official Huaorani reservation in 1969, consolidating the Huaorani and consequently opening up the area to commerce and oil exploration. By 1973, over 500 people lived in Tihueno, of which more than half had arrived in the previous six years. The settlement relied on aid from SIL, and as a Christian community, followed rules foreign to Huaorani culture like prohibitions on killing and polygamy. By the early 1970s, SIL began to question whether their impact on the Huaorani was positive, so they sent James Yost, a staff anthropologist, to assess the situation. He found extensive economic dependence and increasing cultural assimilation, and as a result, SIL ended its support of the settlement in 1976, leading to its disintegration and the dispersion of the Huaorani into the surrounding area. SIL had hoped that the Huaorani would return to the isolation <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> lived twenty years prior, but instead they sought out contact with the outside world, forming villages of which many have been recognized by the Ecuadorian government.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{office in}} January 1906, Barkley saved taxpayers over $35,000 by {{challenging}} improper charges to the county. He prosecuted two magistrates for approving contracts <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{a conflict of}} interest. Even Republicans admitted that he performed well, and he was chosen president of the State Association of County Attorneys. During the 1907 gubernatorial election, he was the Democratic county spokesman, and despite his previous support for the Gold Democrats, he backed William Jennings Bryan in the 1908 presidential election. Friends encouraged him to run for county judge, a powerful position which controlled county funds and patronage, and he announced his candidacy on August 22, 1908. After {{the chairman of the}} county's Democratic Club Executive Committee endorsed him, the incumbent judge, Richard T. Lightfoot, retired rather than challenge him.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of Sam and Max {{were created in}} Purcell's youth; Purcell's younger brother Dave originally came up with several comics around {{the idea of a}} dog and rabbit detective duo. Dave would often leave unfinished comics around the house. Deliberately making the characters mix up each other's names, shoot at each other and mock the way <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been drawn, Steve, in a case of sibling rivalry, would sometimes finish the stories in parodies of their original form. This developed from Steve mocking his brother's to the creation of his own stories with the characters. In the late 1970s, Dave Purcell gave Steve the rights to the characters; he signed them over in a contract on Steve's birthday and allowed him to develop the characters in his own way. Purcell believes that his younger brother has recovered and forgiven him from their earlier years. Having kept one as a pet in his youth, Purcell has an interest in rats, which are commonly featured in his artistic work.|$|E

5|$|Button thus {{inherited}} the lead but reported to his team via radio {{that he was}} losing rear grip in his tyres after pushing hard. He made a pit stop on lap 18 and re-emerged in fourth. Hamilton attempted to pass Vettel around the outside heading into turn 12 on lap 18 {{but was unable to}} complete the manoveure after running deep into the corner. By the end of the 19th lap, all of the leading drivers had taken their pit stops. The running order was Webber leading with Vettel, Hamilton and Button in close attendance, then a 15-second gap back to Schumacher, Rosberg and Kubica. Massa in eighth was being caught by Petrov in ninth, and the two were followed by Alonso, Kobayashi, Sutil, de la Rosa, Alguersuari, Liuzzi, Hülkenberg, Kovalainen, Barrichello, Trulli, Glock, Senna, Buemi, di Grassi and Chandhok. The top nine drivers remained in the same positions <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> qualified, and as the race continued, there was a threat of rain forecast by meteorological service Météo-France which was intensified by the hot weather and heavy clouds brewed {{to the west of the}} circuit. Trulli pulled off to the side of the track with an hydraulic failure, becoming the first retirement of the race on lap 35. Trulli's teammate Kovalainen followed suit on the following lap, after Kovalainen's power steering failed in turn eight which was followed by him not being able to operate his gearbox, clutch and throttle and his car was pushed into the Lotus garage to retire from the event.|$|E
5|$|In {{his rookie}} season, he passed for 3,739yards with 26touchdowns, set five {{different}} NFL rookie records including most touchdown passes in a season, most interceptions (28) in a rookie year, {{and was named}} to the NFL All-Rookie First Team. Manning's first win came against fellow rookie Leaf, 17–12 over the Chargers. Two weeks later, Manning faced off against Steve Young; he threw threetouchdowns, tying a Colts rookie record, but the 49ers kicked a late field goal to win 34–31. In November against the New York Jets, Manning threw for threetouchdowns in a 24–23 win; he was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this performance. It was the first game-winning drive of Manning's career, as he threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Marcus Pollard. Manning was certainly a bright spot in the 1998 season for the Colts, but he also threw a league high 28 interceptions as the team struggled to a 3–13 record with a defense that gave up more than 27 points per game. The Colts lost many close games, including five games <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> led by double-digits at some point.|$|E
5|$|On the {{authority}} of Thomas B. Larkin, Quartermaster General of the United States Army, the US servicemen buried at Brookwood during the Second World War were exhumed in January–May 1948. Those whose next of kin requested it were shipped to the United States for reburial, and the remaining bodies were transferred to the new cemetery outside Cambridge. (Brookwood American Cemetery had also been the burial site for those US servicemen executed while serving in the United Kingdom, whose bodies had been carried to Brookwood by rail from the American execution facilities at Shepton Mallet. They were not transferred to Cambridge in 1948, but instead reburied in unmarked graves at Oise-Aisne American Cemetery Plot E, a dedicated site for US servicemen executed during the Second World War.) The railway service had been suspended in 1941, and North station (renamed North Bar after the ending of rail services) {{was used as a}} temporary mortuary to hold these bodies while awaiting shipment to the USA or Cambridge. As the branch line into the cemetery was no longer in use, temporary platforms were built on the branch line serving the National Rifle Association's shooting range at Bisley, {{on the opposite side of}} the LSWR line from the cemetery. Following the removal of the US war graves the site <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been buried was divided into cemeteries for the Free French forces and Italian prisoners of war.|$|E
