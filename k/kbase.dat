50|$|The {{viral genome}} {{consists}} of a ~145 <b>kbase</b> long unique region, encoding all of expressed viral genes, which is flanked by ~20-30 kbases of terminal repeat sequences. Each terminal repeat unit is 801 bp in length, has 85% G+C content and is oriented in a repetitive head-to-tail fashion. During latency, the virus genome depends on the host replication machinery and replicates as closed circular episome ("plasmid") using sequences within the terminal repeats as a replication origin. When the virus reactivates into lytic replication, {{it is believed that}} the virus genome is replicated as a continuous linear molecule off from an episome (so called rolling circle model). As each unit genome is replicated, it is cut within the terminal repeat region, and then packaged into a virus particle (virion). The virus then becomes enveloped with a lipid membrane as it transits the nucleus and the cytoplasm to exit the cell. Thus, whereas KSHV genome is circular in the nucleus of latently infected cells, it is packaged into infectious viruses as a linear molecule. Once the virus newly infects a cell, the lipid membrane is shed and the virion travels to the nucleus. The viral genome is released where it recircularizes through a poorly understood process that appears to involve homologous recombination.|$|E

In 1994, she co-discovered KSHVhttp://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06EED61338F933A15751C1A962958260&scp=41&sq=moore+chang&st=nyt, also called human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), working with her husband Patrick S. Moore at Columbia University. Chang trained in neuropathology at Stanford University under the noted clinical neuropathologist, Dikran Houroupian, publishing studies on eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. During this period she contributed to studies led by her friend, Julie Parsonnet, showing that Helicobacter pylori is a cause for gastric cancer. She moved to Columbia University to pursue her first academic appointment as a clinician-scientist. Although initially interested in using representational difference analysis to study the genetic origins of brain tumors, she applied this technique to Kaposi's sarcoma resulting in the discovery of this new human tumor virus. Drs. Chang, Moore and collaborators subsequently showed that this virus was the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma, while others showed it to be the cause of some forms of multicentric Castleman's disease. From two small DNA fragments representing less than 1% of the viral genome, she cloned the entire KSHV 165 <b>kbase</b> genome and fully sequenced the virus genome within two years after its initial discovery http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=8962146&query_hl=6&itool=pubmed_docsum.

With metagenomic sequencing finding even wider adoption in the scientific community, the existing web-based analysis tools and infrastructure in MG-RAST provide limited capability for data retrieval and analysis, such as comparative analysis between multiple data sets. Moreover, although the system provides many analysis tools, it is not comprehensive. By opening MG-RAST up via a web services API (application programmers interface) we have greatly expanded access to MG-RAST data, as well as provided a mechanism for the use of third-party analysis tools with MG-RAST data.

This sequence {{has been called the}} ribosomal insertion [Wellauer, P. K. & Dawid, I. B. (1977) Cell 10, 193 - 212]. We report here that members of the same sequence family occur outside the ribosomal locus. “Non-rDNA insertion DNA” was separated from rDNA by density gradient centrifugation, and sequences homologous to the ribosomal insertion were detected by hybridization with restriction endonuclease fragments derived from a cloned rDNA repeating unit. Pure insertion sequences from cloned rDNA separated from main band DNA and behaved like a component with high G + C content. Non-rDNA components hybridizing to the insertion also separated from main band DNA but less so than pure insertion sequences, suggesting that non-rDNA insertion sequences are linked to DNA of different nucleotide composition. Restriction endonuclease analysis of non-rDNA insertion DNA showed many fragments of different sizes. The patterns obtained were similar in embryonic, larval, pupal, and adult DNA and DNA from cultured cells (Schneider cell line 3).

40|$|Long {{stretches}} of protein-free, nonbeaded DNA were observed electron microscopically in nuclear spreads prepared from cells that had replicated their DNA {{in the absence}} of protein synthesis. The amount of this DNA increased with increasing time of replication in the presence of cycloheximide and was greatly decreased when replication was inhibited with 1 -β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (cytosine arabinoside). This DNA is considered to be “free” DNA because it has the same diameter as marker PM 2 DNA and it is preferentially sensitive to DNase I digestion. Reversal of the cycloheximide block resulted in a burst of histone synthesis and repair of the depleted chromatin within 5 min. In addition, 26 presumptive replication forks were observed with beaded chromatin on two arms and free DNA on the third. These results suggest that new histones are usually deposited onto new DNA, that the cellular histone pool is very small, that histone migration is minimal in vivo for at least 18 hr, that for most fibers nuclesome assembly and segregation is conservative for {{stretches of}} DNA as long as 100 <b>kbases,</b> and that some part of the octameric histone core may remain bound to DNA during the replication process.

40|$|UV {{transcription}} mapping with recombinant DNA probes containing immunoglobulin kappa {{light chain}} mRNA sequences {{has been used}} to determine the size of the transcription unit coding for kappa light chain m RNA and to establish the arrangement of variable and constant regions in this transcription unit. In relation to ribosomal RNA standards, the transcription of kappa light chain constant region sequences into nuclear RNA exhibits a UV target size of 9. 6 <b>kbases</b> (kb). The kappa light chain variable region exhibits a UV target size of 7. 6 kb indicating that it is separated by approximately 2. 0 kb from the constant region in the kappa light chain transcription unit. The size of the primary transcript (i. e., the direct, unprocessed RNA product of transcription) predicted from the constant region target size concurs with our previous pulse-labeling results which showed that the largest presumptive nuclear RNA precursor to kappa light chain mRNA is approximately 10 kb. In addition, the UV target size of cytoplasmic kappa mRNA is indistinguishable from the target size of constant region sequences in nuclear RNA. These results suggest that the kappa light chain transcription unit is copied directly into a 10 -kb nuclear RNA precursor in which the kappa variable and constant regions are separated by approximately 2 kb. Accordingly, it is proposed that the joining of immunoglobulin kappa light chain variable and constant regions occurs in the post-transcriptional processing of this large nuclear RNA precursor into kappa light chain mRNA...|$|R

However, TsHKT 1; 2, one of three HKT 1 copies in Thellungiella salsuginea, a halophytic Arabidopsis relative, acts as a Ktransporter {{in the presence of}} Na in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Amino-acid sequence comparisons indicated differences between TsHKT 1; 2 and most other published HKT 1 sequences with respect to an Asp residue (D 207) in the second pore-loop domain. Two additional T. salsuginea and most other HKT 1 sequences contain Asn (N) in this position. Wild-type TsHKT 1; 2 and altered AtHKT 1 (AtHKT 1) complemented K-uptake deficiency of yeast cells. Mutanthkt 1 - 1 plants complemented with both AtHKT 1 and TsHKT 1; 2 showed higher tolerance to salt stress than lines complemented by the wild-type AtHKT 1. Electrophysiological analysis in Xenopus laevis oocytes confirmed the functional properties of these transporters and the differential selectivity for Na and <b>Kbased</b> on the N/D variance in the pore region. This change also dictated inward-rectification for Na transport. Thus, the introduction of Asp, replacing Asn, in HKT 1 -type transporters established altered cation selectivity and uptake dynamics.

This has broad impact, both on the network and on the computational and storage systems connected to the network. 2) Many science collaborations require assistance {{to cope with the}} systems and network engineering challenges inherent in managing the rapid growth in data scale. 3) Several science domains operate distributed facilities that rely on high-performance networking for success. Key examples illustrated in this report include the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) and the Systems Biology Knowledgebase (<b>KBase).</b> This report expands on these points, and addresses others as well. The report contains a findings section as well as the text of the case studies discussed at the review...|$|E
40|$|Plants rarely {{occur in}} {{isolated}} systems. Bacteria can inhabit either the endosphere, the region inside the plant root, or the rhizosphere, the soil region {{just outside the}} plant root. Our goal is to understand if using genomic data and media dependent metabolic model information is better for training machine learning of predicting bacterial ecological niche than media independent models or pure genome based species trees. We considered three machine learning techniques: support vector machine, non-negative matrix factorization, and artificial neural networks. In all three machine-learning approaches, the media-based metabolic models and flux balance analyses were more effective at predicting bacterial niche than the genome or PRMT models. Support Vector Machine trained on a minimal media base with Mannose, Proline and Valine was most predictive of all models and media types with an f-score of 0. 8 for rhizosphere and 0. 97 for endosphere. Thus we can conclude that media-based metabolic modeling provides a holistic view of the metabolome, allowing machine learning algorithms to highlight the differences between and categorize endosphere and rhizosphere bacteria. There was no single media type that best highlighted differences between endosphere and rhizosphere bacteria metabolism and therefore no single enzyme, reaction, or compound that defined whether a bacteria's origin was of the endosphere or rhizosphere.

Listeria monocytogenes is a microorganism {{of great concern}} for the food industry, most notably {{because it is the}} 2 nd most deadly bacterial foodborne pathogen. Therefore, it is important to study the organism in order to identify novel methods of control. Systems biology is one such approach. Using a combination of computational techniques and laboratory methods, genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) can be created, validated, and used to simulate growth environments and discern metabolic capabilities of microbes of interest, including L. monocytogenes. The objective of the work presented here was to generate GEMs for six different strains of L. monocytogenes, and to both qualitatively and quantitatively validate these GEMs with experimental data. Qualitative validation by comparison to phenotypic microarray data resulted in GEMs with nutrient utilization agreement similar to that of previously published GEMs. Additionally, aerobic batch growth experiments resulted in predictions for growth rate and growth yield that were strongly and significantly correlated with experimental values. These findings are significant because they show that these GEMs for L. monocytogenes are comparable in agreement between in silico predictions and in vitro results to published models of other organisms. Therefore, as with the other models, namely those for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio vulnificus, and Salmonella spp., they can be used to determine new methods of growth control and disease treatment. Additionally, the findings confirm the acceptability of using semi-automated tools, like those provided by <b>KBase,</b> to generate GEMs...|$|E

40|$|For many {{scientific}} applications, it {{is highly}} desirable {{to be able to}} compare metabolic models of closely related genomes. In this short report, we attempt to raise awareness to the fact that taking annotated genomes from public repositories and using them for metabolic model reconstructions is far from being trivial due to annotation inconsistencies. We are proposing a protocol for comparative analysis of metabolic models on closely related genomes, using fifteen strains of genus Brucella, which contains pathogens of both humans and livestock. This study lead to the identification and subsequent correction of inconsistent annotations in the SEED database, as well as the identification of 31 biochemical reactions that are common to Brucella, which are not originally identified by automated metabolic reconstructions. We are currently implementing this protocol for improving automated annotations within the SEED database and these improvements have been propagated into PATRIC, Model-SEED, <b>KBase</b> and RAST. This method is an enabling step for the future creation of consistent annotation systems and high-quality model reconstructions that will support in predicting accurate phenotypes such as pathogenicity, media requirements or type of respiration.

40|$|Genome-scale {{metabolic}} models {{provide a}} powerful means to harness information from genomes to deepen biological insights. With exponentially increasing sequencing capacity, {{there is an}} enormous need for automated reconstruction techniques that can provide more accurate models in a short time frame. Current methods for automated metabolic network reconstruction rely on gene and reaction annotations to build draft metabolic networks and algorithms to fill gaps in these networks. However, automated reconstruction is hampered by database inconsistencies, incorrect annotations, and gap filling largely without considering genomic information. Here we develop an approach for applying genomic information to predict alternative functions for genes and estimate their likelihoods from sequence homology. We show that computed likelihood values were significantly higher for annotations found in manually curated metabolic networks than those that were not. We then apply these alternative functional predictions to estimate reaction likelihoods, which are used in a new gap filling approach called likelihood-based gap filling to predict more genomically consistent solutions. To validate the likelihood-based gap filling approach, we applied it to models where essential pathways were removed, finding that likelihood-based gap filling identified more biologically relevant solutions than parsimony-based gap filling approaches. We also demonstrate that models gap filled using likelihood-based gap filling provide greater coverage and genomic consistency with metabolic gene functions compared to parsimony-based approaches. Interestingly, despite these findings, we found that likelihoods did not significantly affect consistency of gap filled models with Biolog and knockout lethality data. This indicates that the phenotype data alone cannot necessarily be used to discriminate between alternative solutions for gap filling and therefore, that the use of other information is necessary to obtain a more accurate network. All described workflows are implemented as part of the DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase (<b>KBase)</b> and are publicly available via API or command-line web interface...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD) is {{a nervous}} {{system-wide}} disease that presents with a bradykinetic movement disorder and is frequently complicated by depression and cognitive impairment. sPD likely has multiple interacting causes that include increased oxidative stress damage to mitochondrial components and reduced mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity. We analyzed mitochondria from postmortem sPD and CTL brains {{for evidence of}} oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), heteroplasmic mtDNA point mutations and levels of electron transport chain proteins. We sought to determine if sPD brains possess any mtDNA genotype-respiratory phenotype relationships. Results Treatment of sPD brain mtDNA with the mitochondrial base-excision repair enzyme 8 -oxyguanosine glycosylase- 1 (hOGG 1) inhibited, in an age-dependent manner, qPCR amplification of overlapping ~ 2 <b>kbase</b> products; amplification of CTL brain mtDNA showed moderate sensitivity to hOGG 1 not dependent on donor age. hOGG 1 mRNA expression was not different between sPD and CTL brains. Heteroplasmy analysis of brain mtDNA using Surveyor nuclease ® showed asymmetric distributions and levels of heteroplasmic mutations across mtDNA but no patterns that statistically distinguished sPD from CTL. sPD brain mitochondria displayed reductions of nine respirasome proteins (respiratory complexes I-V). Reduced levels of sPD brain mitochondrial complex II, III and V, but not complex I or IV proteins, correlated closely with rates of NADH-driven electron flow. mtDNA levels and PGC- 1 α expression did not differ between sPD and CTL brains. Conclusion PD brain mitochondria have reduced mitochondrial respiratory protein levels in complexes I-V, implying a generalized defect in respirasome assembly. These deficiencies {{do not appear to}} arise from altered point mutational burden in mtDNA or reduction of nuclear signaling for mitochondrial biogenesis, implying downstream etiologies. The origin of age-related increases in distribution of oxidative mtDNA damage in sPD but not CTL brains is not clear, tracks with but does not determine the sPD phenotype, and may indicate a unique consequence of aging present in sPD that could contribute to mtDNA deletion generation in addition to mtDNA replication, transcription and sequencing errors. sPD frontal cortex experiences a generalized bioenergetic deficiency above and beyond aging that could contribute to mood disorders and cognitive impairments. </p...|$|E
40|$|The N-methylquinolinium tetrafluoroborate (NMQ(+)) -sensitized {{photolysis}} of the erythro- 1, 2 diphenyl- 2 -arylsulfanylethanols 1 - 3 (1, aryl = phenyl; 2, aryl = 4 -methylphenyl; 3, aryl = 3 -chlorophenyl) {{has been}} investigated in MeCN, under laser flash and steady-state photolysis. Under laser irradiation, the formation of sulfide radical cations of 1 - 3, in the monomeric (lambda(max) = 520540 nm) and dimeric form (lambda(max), = 720 [...] > 800 nm), was observed within the laser pulse. The radical cations decayed by first-order kinetics, and under nitrogen, the formation of ArSCH. Ph (lambda(max) = 350 - 360 nm) was clearly observed. This indicates that the decay of the radical cation {{is due to a}} fragmentation process involving the heterolytic C-C bond cleavage, a conclusion fully confirmed by steady-state photolysis experiments (formation of benzaldehyde and the dimer of the alpha-arylsulfanyl carbon radical). Whereas the fragmentation rate decreases as the C-C bond dissociation energy (BDE) increases, no rate change was observed by the replacement of OH by OD in the sulfide radical cation (k(OH) /k(OD) = 1). This suggests a transition state structure with partial C-C bond cleavage where the main effect of the OH group is the stabilization of the transition state by hydrogen bonding with the solvent. The fragmentation rate of 2 -hydroxy sulfanyl radical cations turned out to be significantly slower than that of nitrogen analogues of comparable reduction potential, probably due to a more efficient overlap between the SOMO in the heteroatom and the C-C bond a-orbital in the second case. The fragmentation rates of 1 (+.) - 3 (+.) were found to increase by addition of a pyridine, and plots of <b>k(base)</b> against base strength were linear, allowing calculation of the beta Brphinsted values, which were found to increase as the reduction potential of the radical cation decreases, beta = 0. 21 (3 (+.)), 0. 34 (1 (+.)) and 0. 48 (2 (+.)). The reactions of 1 (+.) exhibit a deuterium kinetic isotope effect with values that increase as the base strength increases: k(OH) /k(OD) = 1 - 3 (pyridine), 1. 9 (4 -ethylpyridine), and 2. 3 (4 -methoxypyridine). This finding and the observation that with the above three bases the rate decreases in the order 3 (+.) > 1 (+.) > 2 (+.), i. e., as the C-C BDE increases, suggest that C-C and O-H bond cleavages are concerted but not synchronous, with the role of OH bond breaking increasing as the base becomes stronger (variable transition state). It is probable that, with the much stronger base, 4 -(dimethylamino) pyridine, a change to a stepwise mechanism may occur where the slow step is the formation of a radical zwitterion that then rapidly fragmentates to products...|$|E
40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of genome-scale metabolic models from genome annotations {{has become a}} routine practice in Systems Biology research. The potential of metabolic models for predictive biology is widely accepted by the scientific community, but these same models still lack the capability {{to account for the}} effect of gene regulation on metabolic activity. Our focus organism, Bacillus subtilis is most commonly found in soil, being subject {{to a wide variety of}} external environmental conditions. This reinforces the importance of the regulatory mechanisms that allow the bacteria to survive and adapt to such conditions. Existing integrated metabolic regulatory models are currently available for only a small number of well-known organisms (e. g E. coli and B. subtilis). The E. coli integrated model was proposed by Covert et al in 2004 and has slowly improved over the years. Goelzer et al. introduced the B. subtilis integrated model in 2008, covering only the central metabolic pathways. Different strategies were used in the two modeling efforts. The E. coli model is defined by a set of Boolean rules (turning genes ON and OFF) accounting mostly for transcription factors, gene interactions, involved metabolites, and some external conditions such as heat shock. The B. subtilis model introduces a set of more complex rules and also incorporates sigma factor activity into the modeling abstraction. Here we propose a genome-scale model for the regulatory network of B. subtilis, using a new stimulon-based approach. A stimulon is defined as the set of genes (that can be a part of the same operon(s) and regulon(s)) that respond in the same set of stimuli. The proposed stimulon-based approach allows for the inclusion of more types of regulation in the model. This methodology also abstracts away much of the complexity of regulatory mechanisms by directly connecting the activity of genes to the presence or absence of associated stimuli, a necessity in the many cases where details of regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Our model integrates regulatory network data from the Goelzer et al model, in addition to other available literature data. We then reconciled our model against a large set of high-quality gene expression data (tiled microarrays for 104 different conditions). The stimulons in our model were split or extended to improve consistency with our expression data, and the stimuli in our model were adjusted to improve consistency with the conditions of our expression experiments. The reconciliation with gene expression data revealed a significant number of exact or nearly exact matches between the manually curated regulons/stimulons and pure correlation-based regulons. Our reconciliation analysis of the 2011 SubtiWiki regulon release suggested many gene candidates for regulon extension that were subsequently included in the 2013 SubtiWiki update. Our enhanced model also includes an improved coverage of a wide range of different stress conditions. We then integrated our regulatory model with the latest metabolic reconstruction for B. subtilis, the iBsu 1103 V 2 model (Tanaka et al. 2012). We applied this integrated metabolic regulatory model to the simulation of all growth phenotype data currently available for B. subtilis, demonstrating how the addition of regulatory constraints improved consistency of model predictions with experimentally observed phenotype data. This analysis of growth phenotype data unveiled phenotypes that could only be characterized with the addition of regulatory network constraints. All tools applied in the reconstruction, simulation, and curation of our new regulatory model are now publicly available as a part of the <b>KBase</b> framework. These tools permit the direct simulation of gene expression data using the regulon model alone, as well as the simulation of phenotypes and growth conditions using an integrated metabolic and regulatory model. We will highlight these new tools in the context of our reconstruction and analysis of the B. subtilis regulatory model...|$|E
