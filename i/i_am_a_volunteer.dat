40|$|Graduation date: 2001 In June 1999, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>volunteer</b> for <b>a</b> United States {{non-governmental}} organization, Crossroads Africa. I joined {{six other}} American women traveling to Ghana, West Africa {{to participate in}} a collaborative program designed by the Ghana Red Cross Society and Crossroads Africa. Specifically our group was assigned to work on a Women in Development (WID) project with three rural women's collectives, "Mothers Clubs," assisting them with income-generating projects in the Volta Region of Ghana. The projects varied among the villages. hi village one, Anfoeta Tsebi, the women extracted oil from palm fruit and kernels. They sold palm oil at regional markets and used the oil domestically to make stews and soap for washing. In village two, Heffi, Mothers Club members baked bread and processed gari from cassava yarns. In village three, Anyirawase, the women made batiks, tie-dye, beadwork, and woven mats from corn husks. My research objective was to evaluate the role that gender, the WID design, and power played in each project. I also sought to use my observations and the voices of African women to assess the successes and failures of the collaborative program of the Ghana Red Cross and Crossroads Africa. I used participant observation to gather this information. The sample was inclusive of project participants. I found that the womens' collectives provided positive networks of support for members. The women taught our Crossroads volunteers about how they were creating change. The collectives also showed how successful development depends on improving {{the quality of life for}} individuals. The women gained skills in leadership and health education, while they improved their economic situation. Women were becoming collectively empowered through their role as active agents for change in their communities. Their hard work, dedication, and widespread recognition of their accomplishments contributed to group empowerment. My findings suggest that the primary obstacles to project success were lack of resources and time and physical exhaustion from an increased workload Poor preparation and training for Crossroads volunteers and their ideological fragmentation prevented effective assistance and collaboration with the Mothers Clubs. One of my recommendations for future improvements is to integrate men into the development process to play a constructive role and minimize their opportunity for unwanted interference. Another recommendation is to encourage Ghana Red Cross leaders to hold seminars for women from different villages to allow for an exchange of knowledge about development projects. Finally, recommend that Crossroads Africa and Ghana Red Cross leaders make a greater effort to collaborate and improve preparation and training for participants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Anthropology {{has long}} {{recognized}} the inadvertent polluting {{power of the}} male and female genitals. In his important discussion of Yoruba beliefs in female power and witchcraft, Raymond Prince (1961) recognized that African women know very well that they can direct the power that can emanate from their own genitals, and in some extreme situ-ations their threats to loosen this power are strongly persuasive. Only a few others have recognized the aggressive use of female genital power. Further research in this area has important implications for understanding African ideas of sexuality.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{situated}} in the discipline of HCI and contributes toward understanding the role of digital technology in cultural heritage interpretation. Cultural heritage professionals (CHPs), including curators and museum educators, are increasingly adopting digital technologies to engage visitors in their museums. The growing availability of and access to technology opens opportunities for CHPs with limited experience of interactive technologies to create content for and configure visitor interactions with technology. This provides avenues for small museums to integrate interactive technologies. However, there remains a gap in understanding how CHPs undertake evolving technology-enabled practices in context. Therefore, this study investigates the practices of CHPs in a small museum, as they become more prominently involved in using digital technologies. The study focuses on CHPs working at The Hunt Museum in Limerick (Ireland) where <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>volunteer</b> for three years. Based on an extensive ethnographic study conducted over three years, this thesis details the practices of the Hunt Museum CHPs in preparing, creating and adapting museum activities, such as workshops and tours. It further documents the viewpoints of the CHPs in using digital technologies as part of these practices. Using action research, the thesis analyses the CHPs’ journey in shaping existing resources in response to integrating a new interactive technology. I reflect on my role in facilitating this process. The findings suggest that, while lowering the technological barriers is imperative, CHPs also face implications integrating interactive technologies as interpretive aids. Taking control of the interpretive content could require building {{the skills necessary to}} design content on a medium CHPs may be unfamiliar with. Moreover, it appears that CHPs need to understand how the behaviour of interactive technologies affects the intended visitor experience. I further argue the need to support CHPs in small museums in addressing these implications associated with technology adoption...|$|R
40|$|Curiously, {{the issue}} of war has never <b>been</b> {{considered}} <b>a</b> solid basis for examining the works of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Yet one common thread running through the body of their work <b>is</b> war. <b>A</b> study of the authors’ attitudes toward war and their characters’ responses to war in Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms (1929), For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940), The Sun Also Rises (1926), and Fitzgerald’s This Side of Paradise (1920), The Great Gatsby (1925), and Tender Is the Night (1934), yields several conclusions. Hemingway’s and Fitzgerald’s works reveal {{two different types of}} human responses to the effects of war while the characters search for ways to attain quality in life. Both the Hemingway and Fitzgerald protagonists suffer from the chaotic environment wrought by war. However, contemporary readers should find Fitzgerald’s characters particularly relevant because they confront a dilemma that mirrors more realistically man’s struggle for salvation in modern, post-war society. The element of war shapes the lives of both sets of characters, and yet very little criticism exists which presents war as a basis to consider any of the works by Hemingway and Fitzgerald together. The critics traditionally see war as having a major impact on the life and works of Ernest Hemingway; in contrast, most critics see war as playing no significant role in the life and works of Fitzgerald. However, both writers’ lives were shaped immensely by war. Biographically, Hemingway volunteered to serve in Italy during World War <b>I</b> and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>volunteer</b> journalist in Spain during the Spanish Civil war, experiences that helped to shape his strong sense of masculinity and superiority; though Fitzgerald never served in a war, the fact helped to create his deep sense of inferiority and failure as a man. Both men’s experiences with war helped to formulate attitudes reflected in the fiction and account, in part, for the substantial differences in their approaches to theme and setting. So, the effects of war provide a valid basis for considering the lives, and subsequently, the works of Hemingway and Fitzgerald...|$|R
