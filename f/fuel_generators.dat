2500|$|Environmental {{impact of}} wind power {{includes}} effect on wildlife. [...] Thousands of birds, including rare species, {{have been killed}} by the blades of wind turbines, though wind turbines contribute relatively insignificantly to anthropogenic avian mortality. For every bird killed by a wind turbine in the US, nearly 500,000 are killed by each of feral cats and buildings.. In comparison, conventional coal fired generators contribute significantly more to bird mortality, by incineration when caught in updrafts of smoke stacks and by poisoning with emissions byproducts (including particulates and heavy metals downwind of flue gases). Further, marine life is affected by water intakes of steam turbine cooling towers (heat exchangers) for nuclear and fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>generators,</b> by coal dust deposits in marine ecosystems (e.g. damaging Australia's Great Barrier Reef) and by water acidification from combustion monoxides.|$|E

To facilitate appropriate comparisons between solar <b>fuels</b> <b>generators,</b> as well as to enable concise and consistent identification of the state-of-the-art for designs based on comparable operating principles, we have developed a taxonomy and nomenclature for solar <b>fuels</b> <b>generators</b> based on the source of the asymmetry that separates photogenerated electrons and holes.

40|$|It {{seems that}} you can ask the Coalition {{government}} pretty much any question – about plunging polls, Donald Trump, Cory Bernardi or even the weather – and the answer {{will always be the}} same: “We’re focused on electricity prices. ” Great. But what exactly is the Coalition doing about them? On the evidence to date, not a whole lot, apart from blaming renewables for soaring wholesale electricity costs and promoting something called “clean coal,” despite all the evidence pointing to the fact that coal generation is not very clean, and not cheap. They are chasing the wrong target. Australia has experienced some extraordinarily high wholesale electricity prices this summer, and most of these price surges have come in states with little large-scale wind or solar.

40|$|Tanzania depends {{heavily on}} {{hydropower}} for her electricity demand and experiences power shortage {{during the dry}} seasons. Wind energy is proposed as an alternative source of electricity to fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>generators</b> during the dry season, the latter are normally used to supplement the shortfall in hydro-electricity generation. Fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>generators</b> produce emissions that are toxic and as such degrade the environment. Wind speed data from a site called Setchet is used to illustrate that the available wind energy can be harvested to generate electricity that can supplement the shortfall of electricity. The windy season, which is from July to November, coincides with the dry season. The annual average wind speed is 8. 3 m/s, a value that is suficient to generate electricity. Wind energy that can be harvested from this annual average wind speed is 2. 3 0 ~ 1 o 3 kwh per year.
