5|$|Although the HIV/AIDS <b>epidemic</b> has {{affected}} men, women, {{and children in}} Malawi, certain factors such as sexual orientation, gender, and age influence infection patterns. In Malawi, HIV/AIDS is usually transmitted through heterosexual sex, but the <b>epidemic</b> has also significantly impacted the homosexual male population in Malawi. In addition, women in Malawi {{are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men, suggesting that women are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Finally, the disease {{has affected}} children and young adults both directly and indirectly; 170,000 Malawian children were HIV-positive in 2011, and the number of orphans in Malawi has increased dramatically since the <b>epidemic</b> began in 1985.|$|E

In 1989, Banda introduced a five-year World Bank Medium Term Plan to combat the <b>epidemic,</b> but HIV prevalence had already increased drastically at this point.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} <b>epidemic,</b> convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection. Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV, {{women are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The <b>epidemic</b> has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the <b>epidemic</b> has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E

40|$|To better {{understand}} the potential economic repercussions of a bioterrorist attack, this paper explores the effects of several catastrophic <b>epidemics</b> that struck American cities between 1690 and 1880. The <b>epidemics</b> considered here killed between 10 and 25 percent of the urban population studied. A particular {{emphasis is placed on}} smallpox and yellow fever, both of which have been identified as potential bioterrorist agents. The central findings of the paper are threefold. First, severe localized <b>epidemics</b> did not disrupt, in any permanent way, the population level or long-term growth trajectory of those cities. Non-localized <b>epidemics</b> (i. e., those that struck more than one major city) do appear to have had some negative effect on population levels and long-term growth. There is also modest evidence that ill-advised responses to <b>epidemics</b> on the part of government officials might have had lasting and negative effects in a few cities. Second, severe localized <b>epidemics</b> did not disrupt trade flows; non-localized <b>epidemics</b> had adverse, though fleeting, effects on trade. Third, while severe <b>epidemics</b> probably imposed some modest costs on local and regional economies, these costs were very small relative to the national economy. ...|$|R

During the seven weeks the <b>epidemic</b> lasted, 51 people were buried in B'nai Israel's cemetery, almost twice the number {{typically}} buried there in a whole year. When another yellow fever <b>epidemic</b> broke out in 1878, Samfield stayed again, ministering to the dead and dying of all faiths. During that <b>epidemic</b> 78 people were buried in the congregation's cemetery. The city's frequent yellow fever epidemics decimated its Jewish community, which dropped from 2,100 to 300. They also hurt B'nai Israel's finances; members did not pay their dues, {{and for a time}} the congregation could not afford to pay Samfield. By 1880, however, membership had increased to 124 families, and finances had improved. By this time, the synagogue was more typically called Children of Israel. Beth El Emeth was affected more severely than Children of Israel by the epidemics; its rabbi (Peres) died of yellow fever in 1879. In 1882, Beth El Emeth disbanded, and transferred its property to Children of Israel, though most Beth El Emeth members joined the Orthodox Baron Hirsch Synagogue. The property included land on Second Street, and Beth El Emeth's cemetery.|$|E

40|$|Organisms {{that can}} resist {{parasitic}} infection often have lower fitness {{in the absence}} of parasites. These costs of resistance can mediate host evolution during parasite <b>epidemics.</b> For example, large <b>epidemics</b> will select for increased host resistance. In contrast, small <b>epidemics</b> (or no disease) can select for increased host susceptibility when costly resistance allows more susceptible hosts to outcompete their resistant counterparts. Despite their importance for evolution in host populations, costs of resistance (which are also known as resistance trade‐offs) have mainly been examined in laboratory‐based host–parasite systems. Very few examples come from field‐collected hosts. Furthermore, little is known about how resistance trade‐offs vary across natural populations. We addressed these gaps using the freshwater crustacean D aphnia dentifera and its natural yeast parasite, M etschnikowia bicuspidata. We found a cost of resistance in two of the five populations we studied – those with the most genetic variation in resistance and the smallest <b>epidemics</b> in the previous year. However, yeast <b>epidemics</b> in the current year did not alter slopes of these trade‐offs before and after <b>epidemics.</b> In contrast, the no‐cost populations showed little variation in resistance, possibly because large yeast <b>epidemics</b> eroded that variation in the previous year. Consequently, our results demonstrate variation in costs of resistance in wild host populations. This variation has important implications for host evolution during <b>epidemics</b> in nature...|$|R
