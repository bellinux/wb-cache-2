50|$|The {{original}} use of {{the term}} in English was in tandem harness, which is used for two or more draft horses, or other draft animals, harnessed in a single line one behind another, as opposed to a pair, <b>harnessed</b> <b>side</b> by side, or a team of several pairs. The tandem harness allows additional animals to provide pulling power for a vehicle designed for a single animal.|$|R

50|$|The kurgans contain mixed {{types of}} graves, with logs, stone boxes and dugouts. Burials are mostly solitary. The buried are laid in a {{crouched}} position, predominantly {{on the left}} side. The main burial is orientated with its head to the west, the others may somewhat deviate depending on their location in the kurgan. A typical feature is the deposition of horse <b>harnesses</b> at the <b>side</b> of the central burial pit, but {{in contrast with the}} Arzhan-period monuments there are as a rule no accompanying horse burials.|$|R

The people who are born deeply connected to the Force have better reflexes; through training and meditation, {{they are able to}} achieve various supernatural feats (such as telekinesis, clairvoyance, precognition, and mind control). The Force is wielded by two major factions at conflict: the Jedi, who <b>harness</b> the light <b>side</b> of the Force, and the Sith, who use {{the dark side of the}} force through hate and aggression.|$|R
500|$|Sling {{cylinders}} are a {{configuration of}} independent cylinders used for technical diving. [...] They are independent cylinders {{with their own}} regulators and are carried clipped to the <b>harness</b> at the <b>side</b> of the diver. [...] Their purpose may be to carry either stage, travel, decompression, or bailout gas while the back mounted cylinder(s) carry bottom gas. Stage cylinders carry gas to extend bottom time, travel gas is used to reach a depth where bottom gas may be safely used if it is hypoxic at the surface, and decompression gas is gas intended to be used during decompression to accelerate the elimination of inert gases. Bailout gas is an emergency supply intended {{to be used to}} surface if the main gas supply is lost.|$|R

Mathematical models are built using the response surface method based on simulation results whereby good fitness is achieved. The singular and cross interactive effect of each predictor on the neck moment are analyzed. The number of significant parameters affecting the neck moment is shown {{to be the largest}} for wide impact angles (ϕ≥ 60 °) and the impact angle parameter is largely revealed to be the most sensitive. An ideal safe range for low neck moment has been established to be within ϕ angles 45 ° and 65 °.

40|$|A novel crutch, {{the harness}} crutch, is {{described}} which reduces loading {{on the arms}} during the swing phase of swing-through gait. The device was fabricated by attaching a modified mountaineering <b>harness</b> by two <b>side</b> straps, to modified axillary crutches. The harness crutch was compared with the saddle crutch, described by Taylor in 1883. The saddle crutch produced pressures in excess of 500 mmHg in the perineal area; no pressures were produced in this area with the harness crutch. Ischial pressures produced by both systems were similar. In six out of eight non-impaired subjects, significantly more force was transmitted to the harness crutch (an average 47 % of body weight) than to the saddle crutch (an average 40 % of body weight). A comparison of the oxygen cost of swing-through gait was made between the harness crutch and unmodified axillary crutches; with the harness crutch oxygen cost was significantly lower (p < 0. 01) {{and there were no}} significant differences in speed and stride length...|$|R

One of the ICT industries – the micro sourcing industry – {{has been identified}} as one of a potential industry to help increase income for the poor in Malaysia. Micro sourcing is an effective way to accomplish tedious tasks at a faster rate. It involves large projects that are broken down into micro tasks. These micro tasks are welldefined and then distributed to a group of workers. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop the strategic framework of micro sourcing to generate income for the low income group. Four methods were used to gather information for this study. The methods used were documentation and literature reviews, focus group meetings, workshops and interviews. Based on the analysis of the current scenario of local micro sourcing industry, strategic framework was developed based on the five Strategic Thrusts identified. The Strategic Thrusts are <b>harnessing</b> demand <b>side</b> (job providers) of domestic and international market; platform capacity and capability building; leverage and utilise existing infrastructure; uplift and enhance capability of the supply side (micro workers); and instruments to expedite growth of local micro sourcing industry.

40|$|Netwar is an {{emerging}} mode {{of conflict in}} which the protagonists- ranging from terrorist and criminal organizations on the dark side, to militant social activists on the bright side- use network forms of organization, doctrine, strategy, and technology attuned to the information age. The practice of netwar is well ahead of theory, as both civil and uncivil society actors are increasingly engaging in this new way of fighting. We suggest how the theory of netwar may be improved by drawing on academic perspectives on networks, especially those about organizational network analysis. As for practice, strategists and policymakers in Washington and elsewhere have begun to discern {{the dark side of}} the network phenomenon- especially in the wake of the &quot;attack on America &quot; perpetrated apparently by Osama bin Laden's terror network. But they still have much work to do to begin <b>harnessing</b> the bright <b>side,</b> by formulating strategies that will enable state and civil-society actors to work together better.

60|$|My {{excursions}} in the environs {{have made}} me acquainted with {{a great variety of}} modes of communication between the capital and its adjacent, villages. Although Paris is pared down so accurately, and is almost without suburbs, the population, within a circuit of ten miles in each direction, is almost equal to that of Paris itself. St. Denis has several thousands, St. Germain the same, and Versailles is still a town of considerable importance. All these places, with villages out of number, keep up daily intercourse with the city, and in addition to the hundreds of vegetable carts that constantly pass to and fro, there are many conveyances that are exclusively devoted to passengers. The cheapest and lowest is called a coucou for no reason that I can see, unless it be that a man looks very like a fool to have a seat in one of them. They are large cabriolets, with two and even three seats. The wheels are enormous, and there is commonly a small horse <b>harnessed</b> by the <b>side</b> of a larger, in the hills, to drag perhaps eight or nine people. One is amazed to see the living carrion that is driven about a place like Paris, in these uncouth vehicles. The river is so exceedingly crooked, that it is little used by travellers above Rouen.|$|R
40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{assessing}} {{the influence of}} workplace stress on employee’s performance at Mbeya Regional Hospital, Tanzania. The objectives {{of the study were}} to assess the employees’ performance, to assess the stress levels among employees, and {{to determine the extent to}} which employees’ performance is related to their stress levels. A cross sectional survey research design was used on a sample of 120 respondents attained through stratified sampling and convenience sampling techniques. Primary data were collected using structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistical and multiple regression analysis were used in analyzing the data with the aid of SPSS version 20. Findings reveal that majority of doctors; nurses and medical attendants experience high level of job performance accompanied with moderate level of work stress. The total work stress scores were statistically significantly positively related to employees’ performance. However, the results also showed that workplace stress subscales were insignificantly positively related to employees’ performance. The results suggest that work place stress keeps employees on their toes leading to better performance. It is recommended therefore that for the hospital to maintain the current and future performance levels, its management should moderate stress levels in order to <b>harness</b> the positive <b>side</b> of work place stress, short of which the negatives side of work place stress may prevail.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 Chapter 1. Dispersal and {{migration}} are spatially limited in many natural populations. Such limitations {{can lead to}} clustering of like types, which weakens competition between unlike types; thus, the rate by which a fitter type displaces an inferior competitor can {{be affected by the}} spatial scale of movement. We use a birth-death model to show that, by creating competitive refugia, limited migration can increase the frequency of deleterious mutants at mutation-selection balance. Chapter 2. For a novel genotype to establish in a population, it must (1) be created, and (2) not be subsequently lost. Recombination is a double-edged sword in this process, potentially fostering creation, but also hastening loss as the novel genotype is being recombined with other genotypes, especially when rare. In this chapter, we find that spatial structure may allow a population to <b>harness</b> the creative <b>side</b> of sex while avoiding its destructive side; that is, it may allow a population to create rare genotypes via recombination, and allow those rare genotypes to persist despite recombination. Chapter 3. In this chapter, we show that classical rules for predicting competitive outcomes in continuous-time systems are appropriate for a certain subset of discrete-time systems, which motivates a new discrete-time competitive exclusion principle. However, in discrete-time systems in which our proof's assumptions are not held, we show that classical rules can fail dramatically...|$|R
40|$|Data {{has always}} played an {{important}} role in assisting business decisions and overall improvement of a company’s strategies. The introduction of what has come to be named ‘BIG data’ has changed the industry paradigm altogether for a few domains like media, mobility, retail and social. Data from the real world is also considered as BIG data based on its magnitude, sources and the industry’s capacity to handle the same. Although, the healthcare industry has been using real world data for decades, digitization of health records has demonstrated its value to all the stakeholders with a reaffirmation of interest in it. Over time, companies are looking to adopt new technologies in linking these fragmented data for meaningful and actionable insights to demonstrate their value over competition. It has also been noticed that the consequences of not demonstrating the value of data are sometimes leads regulators and payers to be severe. The real challenge though is not in identifying data sets but transforming these data sets into actionable real time insights and business decisions.

Water security itself means the capacity of population to harvest the benefits of water for human'slife and environment and {{to protect themselves from}} water-related hazards at the same time 1, 2. Many developed countries which have invested earlier in both water infrastructure and institutions have achieved their water security status. As a result, they are able to <b>harness</b> the supportive <b>side</b> of water for economic growth. On the other hand, water investment in developing countries {{has not been able to}} fulfill basic requirements inthe protection and access to water 3. Global change puts additional pressure for countries in achieving water security due to increasing uncertainties and frequency and magnitude of extreme events. Increasing population, change of life style due to economic development, and declining of water quality and quantity reduce the access to supportive side of water. Government also plays central role in the early investment in achieving basic water security through its fiscal resources. Before achieving water security, public investment in water security will not significantly improve the economic growth of a country and therefore politically become unpopular. In addition to this, threats from global change will likely give adverse effects and shocks on economy unless these threats are not properly addressed in water investment. Analysis using decision support system in hydro-economic may help these governments to manage their investment strategically taking into account the associated risk of global change. Thus, this paper will review the existing hydro-economic models and their potential contribution in supporting decision in water investment related to water security concept...|$|R
