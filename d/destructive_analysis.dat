500|$|Specimen AMNH NJ-90Z {{is a small}} {{wedge-shaped}} {{fragment of}} pileus which was accidentally fractured during preparation for study, splitting it in half. Though the researchers had not intended to perform <b>destructive</b> <b>analysis</b> on the sample, this fracturing warranted the sacrifice of {{some parts of the}} specimen for structural and molecular study. [...] Small pieces of the specimen were mounted directly on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) stubs and sputter coated with a gold/palladium alloy. [...] The resulting images showed that little intact tissue remained, and only fragmented and crushed basidiospores were seen. [...] Another sample of the specimen was mounted in spurr's resin (an embedding medium used in electron microscopy) and sectioned with a diamond knife; the resulting sections were examined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). [...] The lack of discernible biological material from the mushroom seen in the SEM study was confirmed in the TEM analysis. [...] A final section of the fossil was selected to attempt DNA sequencing.

[...] It is possible that the fractures and flowlines which split AMNH NJ-90Z during initial preparation had already penetrated into the fossil and destroyed the hermetic seal which would have been needed for preserving the organic matter of the mushroom.|$|E
6000|$|What his {{father-in-law}} frankly counselled {{was that the}} reasonable, the really too reasonable, pair should, while they were about it, take {{three or four weeks}} of Paris as well--Paris being always, for Mr. Verver, in any stress of sympathy, a suggestion that rose of itself to the lips. If they would only do that, on their way back, or however they preferred it, Charlotte and he would go over to join them there for a small look--though even then, assuredly, as he had it at heart to add, not in the least because they should have found themselves bored at being left together. The fate of this last proposal indeed was that it reeled, for the moment, under an assault of <b>destructive</b> <b>analysis</b> from Maggie, who--having, as she granted, to choose between being an unnatural daughter or an unnatural mother, and [...] "electing" [...] for the former--wanted to know what would become of the Principino if the house were cleared of everyone but the servants. Her question had fairly resounded, but it had afterwards, like many of her questions, dropped still more effectively than it had risen: the highest moral of the matter being, before the couple took their departure, that Mrs. Noble and Dr. Brady must mount unchallenged guard over the august little crib. If she hadn't supremely believed in the majestic value of the nurse, whose experience was in itself the amplest of pillows, just as her attention was a spreading canopy from which precedent and reminiscence dropped as thickly as parted curtains--if she hadn't been able to rest in this confidence she would fairly have sent her husband on his journey without her. In the same manner, if the sweetest--for it was so she qualified him--of little country doctors hadn't proved to her his wisdom by rendering irresistible, especially on rainy days and in direct proportion to the frequency of his calls, adapted to all weathers, that she should converse with him for hours over causes and consequences, over what he had found to answer with his little five at home, she would have drawn scant support from the presence of a mere grandfather and a mere brilliant friend. These persons, accordingly, her own predominance having thus, for the time, given way, could carry with a certain ease, and above all with mutual aid, their consciousness of a charge. So far as their office weighed they could help each other with it--which was in fact to become, as Mrs. Noble herself loomed larger for them, not a little of a relief and a diversion.|$|E

50|$|Delayed neutron {{analysis}} {{can be used}} for accurate screening of various materials for fissile content. The determination requires only six minutes and features a 15-picogram detection limit. Samples of smears, vegetation, soil, rock, plastics, wood, metal, and sand are equally amenable to delayed neutron analysis. This tool facilitates International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA efforts to establish wide area monitoring and enables individual inspectors to obtain large numbers of samples in the hopes of finding required evidence. By screening those samples, the very high costs of <b>destructive</b> <b>analysis</b> are required only for those samples deemed interesting. Delayed neutron analysis is becoming increasingly useful for these studies.|$|E
50|$|KF {{has a high}} {{accuracy}} and precision, typically within 1% of available water, e.g. 3.00% appears as 2.97 - 3.03%. Although KF is a <b>destructive</b> <b>analysis,</b> the sample quantity is small and is typically limited by the accuracy of weighing. For example, {{in order to obtain}} an accuracy of 1% using a scale with the typical accuracy of 0.2 mg, the sample must contain 20 mg water, which is e.g. 200 mg for a sample with 10% water. For coulometers, the measuring range is from 1-5 ppm to ca. 5%. Volumetric KF readily measures samples up to 100%, but requires impractically large amounts of sample for analytes with less than 0.05% water. The KF response is linear. Therefore, single-point calibration using a calibrated 1% water standard is sufficient and no calibration curves are necessary.|$|E

50|$|Electrically {{connecting}} the failing pin to a ground pin produced the electric current path {{shown in figure}} 2. This electrical path strongly suggests that the current is somehow flowing through all the ground nets though a conductive path located {{very close to the}} wirebond pads from the top down view of the package.

The listing of certain congeners that are constituents of commercial PBDE mixtures (including c-octaBDE) in the Stockholm Convention and tightening regulation of many other BFRs in recent years have created the need for a rapid and effective method of identifying BFR-containing plastics. A three-tiered testing strategy comparing results from non-destructive testing (X-ray fluorescence (XRF)) (n = 1714), a surface wipe test (n = 137) and <b>destructive</b> chemical <b>analysis</b> (n = 48) was undertaken to systematically identify BFRs in a wide range of consumer products. XRF rapidly identified bromine in 92 % of products later confirmed to contain BFRs.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Archaeological dental {{calculus}} is a {{rich source}} of host-associated biomolecules. Importantly, however, dental calculus is more accurately described as a calcified microbial biofilm than a host tissue. As such, concerns regarding <b>destructive</b> <b>analysis</b> of human remains may not apply as strongly to dental calculus, opening the possibility of obtaining human health and ancestry information from dental calculus in cases where <b>destructive</b> <b>analysis</b> of conventional skeletal remains is not permitted. Here we investigate the preservation of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in archaeological dental calculus and its potential for full mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) reconstruction in maternal lineage ancestry analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracted DNA from six individuals at the 700 -year-old Norris Farms # 36 cemetery in Illinois was enriched for mtDNA using in-solution capture techniques, followed by Illumina high-throughput sequencing. RESULTS: Full mitogenomes (7 - 34 ×) were successfully reconstructed from dental calculus for all six individuals, including three individuals who had previously tested negative for DNA preservation in bone using conventional PCR techniques. Mitochondrial haplogroup assignments were consistent with previously published findings, and additional comparative analysis of paired dental calculus and dentine from two individuals yielded equivalent haplotype results.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the Leaf Area Index (LAI) by indirect methods in plantations of Eucalyptus clones in two distinct physical-climatic sites, during the dry and rainy periods. The study was performed in four young and adult Eucalyptus stands, located in Rio Doce basin, eastern Minas Gerais state (Brazil) situated in areas of lower and higher altitudes. Nine plots were allocated in each stand. Experimental data were collected in months representing the driest and the wettest periods. LAI indirect measurements were performed using the LAI- 2000 equipment and cameras with hemispherical lens.

The LAI measurements by the LAI- 2000 was the one which best correlated with the observed LAI (R = 0. 90), although the hemispherical photos had presented good potential use.
