25|$|Reverse {{inference}} {{demonstrates the}} logical fallacy of affirming what you <b>just</b> <b>found,</b> although this logic could {{be supported by}} instances where a certain outcome is generated solely by a specific occurrence. With regard to the brain and brain function it is seldom that a particular brain region is activated solely by one cognitive process. Some suggestions to improve the legitimacy of reverse inference have included both increasing the selectivity of response in the brain region of interest and increasing the prior probability of the cognitive process in question. However, Poldrack suggests that reverse inference should be used merely {{as a guide to}} direct further inquiry rather than a direct means to interpret results.|$|E
25|$|The best-known mole {{is named}} after the city of Puebla, mole poblano. The origin of this sauce is disputed {{and there are two}} {{versions}} of the legend that are most often cited. The first states that 16th century nuns from the Convent of Santa Rosa were worried because they had <b>just</b> <b>found</b> out that the archbishop was going to visit them and they had nothing to prepare for him except for an old turkey in the yard. Supposedly due to divine inspiration, they began to mix together many of the spices and flavorings they had on hand in the kitchen, including different types of chili peppers, other spices, day-old bread, chocolate and approximately twenty other ingredients. They let the sauce simmer for hours and poured it over the turkey meat. Fortunately, the archbishop was very pleased with the meal and the nuns were able to save face.|$|E
25|$|Later {{on in the}} woods, Regina and Emma stumble onto Henry {{practicing}} {{and both}} give him a boost of encouragement. This bought back memories for Regina as she reflected about how Cora killed Daniel, which gave Regina an idea to obtain the tear, which could come from her by using the dreamcatcher. When Emma tried using it, the potion didn’t work, as Regina has moved on to Robin. Meanwhile, Henry treats Violet to dinner and a movie at Granny's and she is impressed, but when the subject of dating or courting came up, Violet tells Henry {{that she wants to}} just be friends, but explains that it was not because of her father's disapproval of him. This devastated Henry because he is not a hero in this universe. He is consoled by Regina, who then takes Henry's teardrop to Emma and tells Henry he <b>just</b> <b>found</b> a way to save Emma.|$|E

25|$|Darius Just had {{previously}} helped novice writer Giles Devore produce a breakthrough novel. Just credits himself with ruthlessly editing Devore's original drafts and forcing the young author to turn an incoherent mess into a masterwork. Having gained {{fame and fortune}} with his first book, a bestseller, Devore attends the ABA convention to promote his second book, which he wrote without Just's help. Just volunteers to run an errand for Devore – collecting a parcel for him and taking it to his hotel room – but he forgets to do so until the next day. Entering Devore's hotel room, Just discovers Devore dead in the bathroom, apparently having slipped in the shower and hit {{his head on the}} faucets. Others take this to be a tragic accident and nothing more, but Just suspects murder, based on Devore's compulsive tidiness and the disarray in which <b>Just</b> <b>found</b> the room. He interviews Devore's ex-wife, who tells him that the parcel contained Devore's monogrammed pens.|$|E
25|$|It was {{revealed}} following Mayweather vs Pacquiao that Pacquiao had sustained an undisclosed injury {{to his right}} shoulder while training, and that while it had healed {{in time for the}} fight, he re-injured it during the 4th round. , currently Pacquiao is facing a lawsuit of 5 million dollars by two fans for failing to disclose the shoulder injury in the lead up to his bout with Floyd Mayweather, Jr. Pacquiao failed to disclose the injury to the Nevada State Athletic Commission in the pre-fight injury evaluation. The commission did a standard injury report with Pacquiao filling out the form saying that he had no injuries heading into the bout. Pacquiao said he had sustained the injury weeks out from the fight after the loss to Mayweather. However, after facing lawsuits due to Pacquiao's statement, Pacquiao has said that he sustained the injury during the fight in which it flared up in the 3rd round. The Nevada State Athletic Commission stated and the post fight press conference that they had only <b>just</b> <b>found</b> out about Pacquiao's injury that evening at the post fight press conference. Speculation arose that the injury was an excuse for the loss to Mayweather because Pacquiao did not mention an injury in the post fight interview with Max Kellerman. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum stated that Pacquiao suffered the injury back in 2008 causing even more confusion as Pacquiao just stated that he suffered the injury during the fight now that he is facing lawsuits.|$|E

500|$|Although the episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the Danish mystery novel Smilla's Sense of Snow, there are no other allusions to the book in the episode. In the episode's setpiece, the Simpsons visit a circus called Cirque du Puree. The circus is {{a reference to}} the Canadian entertainment company Cirque du Soleil. In the film [...] "The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was" [...] (the title of which is a reference to The Halloween That Almost Wasn't), one of the hobgoblins has a similar singing voice as American singer Nelson Eddy.

According to Long, the line was written by either Dana Gould or George Meyer, both of whom are former staff writers. While wreaking havoc in the school, Milhouse can be seen doodling a mustache on a picture of Warren G. Harding, the 29th President of the United States. While ordering Skinner to humiliate himself, Bart says [...] "Di, di, mau". This is {{a reference to the}} 1978 drama film The Deer Hunter, in which the Vietcong says the line to their captives.

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Dan Povenmire, while Peter Shin contributed as supervising director. Various scenes in [...] "PTV" [...] were {{taken out of the}} episode due to Fox's international censors. As the writers worked on the episode the producers ended up, as the Chicago Tribune describes it, [...] "horse trading" [...] with Fox, removing a body-part reference in exchange for a dirty word. While the writing staff of the show was disappointed with the number of scenes that were removed from the episode, they were happy with the final result. The opening sequence, of which Family Guys creator Seth MacFarlane was particularly proud, was added into the episode after the producers discovered the episode ran three minutes short. The episode contained a montage which showcased the most bawdy moments of the previous seasons; Povenmire recalled the sequence; about it he stated that [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>found</b> those off the DVD and digitized them and edited them in. Basically because I didn't want to draw all those things! I found the most disgusting images from the first three seasons. And we actually got network notes on two of them saying, 'You're gonna have to cut that!' And I went, 'This has been on the air! And I'm only showing 8 frames of it!'

500|$|Recording of {{the tracks}} that were to appear on Echo & the Bunnymen began at Conny Plank's studio in Cologne. Both Echo & the Bunnymen and their label, WEA Records, were unhappy {{with the results of}} the Norton {{sessions}} with Palmer playing drums. Keen to record again with de Freitas, the band decided to scrap the Norton sessions and to start recording a new album with Latham who had previously worked with the band on their 1985 single [...] "Bring on the Dancing Horses". The sessions moved from Cologne to ICP Studios in Brussels before returning to Cologne and finishing off at The Workhouse in London and Amazon Studios in Liverpool. The band hoped that the album would be a collection of simple songs; however, Latham was very specific and exacting, and he would work on one song for as long as a month. Recording was also complicated by the star treatment received by McCulloch. This, along with his heavy drinking, alienated him {{from the rest of the}} band. In a 1995 interview, band guitarist Will Sergeant said of McCulloch's treatment, [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>found</b> it all ridiculous.
