40|$|An {{enduring}} {{question in}} {{political and legal}} philosophy concerns whether we have a general moral obligation to follow the law. In this paper, I argue that Philip Soper's intuitively appealing effort to give new life {{to the idea of}} legal obligation by characterising it as a <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> is ultimately unpersuasive. Soper claims that people who understand what a legal system is and admit that it is valuable must recognise that they would be morally inconsistent to deny that they owe deference to state norms. However, if the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> stemmed from people's decision to regard the law as valuable as Soper argues, then people who do not admit the value of the state would have no duty as such to defer to its norms. And, more importantly, people who admit the value of the state would have a duty not to defer to particular norms, namely those norms which violate the values that ground their preference for a state. This critique of Soper operates within his parameters by accepting his claim that moral consistency generates reasons to act. Even on those terms, Soper's defence of legal obligation as a <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> is unpersuasive...|$|E
40|$|Issues {{of public}} trust in justice and {{institutional}} legitimacy {{are becoming increasingly}} salient in debate about criminal justice across Europe. Legitimate authority {{can be defined as}} having three interlinked elements: (a) legality (acting according to the law); (b) shared values (values that are shared by those with authority and those subject to that authority); and (c) consent (the sense amongst the policed of a moral obligation to obey the authority). According to this definition, legitimacy is present not only when individuals recognise the authority of institutions and feel a corresponding <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> to them (consent); it is also present when individuals believe that justice institutions have a proper moral purpose (shared values), and that justice institutions follow their own rules as well as the rules that govern everyone in society (legality). With this definition in mind, we analyse in this chapter data from the fifth European Social Survey on relationships between public trust in justice institutions and public perceptions of the legitimacy of these institutions...|$|E

40|$|Federal {{courts of}} appeals often grant special {{deference}} to district court rulings {{on matters of}} state law. This practice is important. It is also ill-conceived. This Article explores this 2 ̆ 2 rule <b>of</b> <b>deference.</b> 2 ̆ 2 Section I considers the roots and reach of the rule. Together with the Appendices to this Article, it seeks to detail for practitioners, commentators, and judges the way the rule operates in the courts. The remaining sections of this Article consider {{the wisdom of the}} rule <b>of</b> <b>deference.</b> Section II argues that the rule lacks a sound rationale and Section III urges that the rule has bad effects not yet considered by the courts. Section IV suggests that the rule <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> offends Erie R. R. Co. v. Tompkins by producing second-rate appellate review of state law rulings in federal court. Section V observes that there may be unspoken-and unacceptable-reasons why judges have retained the rule. A conflict among the circuits now exists on whether there should be any rule <b>of</b> <b>deference.</b> Another intercircuit conflict exists about how much deference the court should afford if the rule applies. Intracircuit disagreements concerning the rule <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> also have emerged. Most significantly, in almost every circuit, different panels have articulated different formulations of the measure <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> applicable under the rule. In this setting, circuit court reevaluation of the rule is both desirable and predictable. Supreme Court consideration also may wait in the wings. The thesis of this Article is that the federal courts should abandon the rule <b>of</b> <b>deference.</b> The discussion that follows seeks to show why...|$|R

40|$|The Supreme Court’s recent Eighth Amendment {{death penalty}} case law is in disarray, and the {{confusion}} {{is symptomatic of}} a larger problem in constitutional doctrine. In Baze v. Rees and Kennedy v. Louisiana, the Court approached the challenged state policies with vastly different levels <b>of</b> <b>deference.</b> Though the Court purported to apply longstanding Eighth Amendment tests in both cases, Baze was highly deferential to state policy, and Kennedy was not deferential at all. Remarkably, neither the Court nor legal scholars have acknowledged, let alone justified, these contrasting approaches. This Article proposes a theory <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> to address this discrepancy. Courts often premise deference in constitutional cases on political authority and epistemic authority. While these rationales make sense in theory, courts sometimes mechanically repeat them without asking whether the responsible institution enjoys either kind of authority in reality. Courts should engage in such inquiries before summarily granting or denying <b>deference.</b> In light <b>of</b> these principles, the Court approached the problems <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> in Baze and Kennedy carelessly. Whereas Baze assumed (without explanation) that the state possessed political and epistemic authority worthy <b>of</b> <b>deference,</b> Kennedy assumed (also without explanation) the exact opposite. Attention to these issues in the Eighth Amendment and other constitutional contexts would encourage more transparent, deliberative policymaking and more careful, candid judicial constitutional decision making...|$|R
40|$|Deference in {{international}} human rights law has provoked animated discussion, particularly the margin of appreciation doctrine of the European Court of Human Rights. Many commentators describe the practice <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> but do not explain how it affects judicial reasoning. Some approve characteristics <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> but do not provide a justification to defend the practice against criticism. Others regard deference as a danger to human rights because it betrays the universality of human rights or involves tribunals either failing to consider a case properly or missing an opportunity to set human rights standards. This thesis employs a different approach by focussing on deference as the practice of assigning weight to reasons for a decision {{on the basis of}} external factors. This approach draws on theories of second-order reasoning from the philosophy of practical reasoning. The thesis offers a conceptual account <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> that accords with the practice not only of the European Court of Human Rights, but also the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the UN Human Rights Committee. Additionally the thesis presents a normative account <b>of</b> <b>deference,</b> that the role of these tribunals entails permitting a measure of diversity as states implement {{international human rights}} standards. Deference {{in international}} human rights law then is the judicial practice of assigning weight to the respondent states’ reasoning in a case on the basis of three factors: democratic legitimacy, the common practice of states and expertise. This affects judicial reasoning by impacting the balance of reasons in the proportionality assessment. The account defended in this thesis dispels concerns that deference is a danger to human rights, whilst providing a theory that justifies the practice of the tribunals. The thesis thus provides the contours of a doctrine <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> in each <b>of</b> the three international human rights systems.

40|$|Deference — the {{substitution}} by a decisionmaker {{of someone else}} 2 ̆ 7 s judgment for its own — is a pervasive tool of constitutional doctrine. But {{although it has been}} studied at more abstract levels of jurisprudence and at very specific doctrinal levels, it has received surprisingly little general attention in constitutional scholarship. This Article aims to fill that gap. This Article makes three primary contributions to the literature. First, it provides a careful examination <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> as a doctrinal tool in constitutional law, and offers a taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>deference.</b> In particular, it suggests that deference can best be understood as relying on two separate but overlapping grounds: deference {{on the basis of the}} legal authority of the deferee, and deference on the basis of the deferee 2 ̆ 7 s epistemic, or knowledge-based, authority. Importantly, this Article suggests that deference cannot be examined from the standpoint of the deferring institution — usually, the courts — alone. Rather, we must also take into account the obligations of deferees, which should demand deference only for those decisions reached in the full and fair exercise of their legal or epistemic authority. Second, this Article demonstrates the practical benefits of this richer understanding <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> by applying it to a recent case in which the Supreme Court confronted competing claims of deference: Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic 2 ̆ 6 Institutional Rights (FAIR), in which the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the Solomon Amendment, which requires law schools to provide access to campus for military recruiters. In FAIR, the Court faced claims <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> from Congress, acting pursuant to its military powers, and from the law schools, which invoked deference both as expressive associations and as universities. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of these competing claims to deference was unsatisfactory. The Court gave too much deference to Congress, and too little to the law schools. In particular, it failed to accord them the deference they deserved as universities, which serve as vital “First Amendment institutions” in the universe of public discourse. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s failure to soundly address these competing claims <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> bespeaks a larger failure to theorize the nature <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> and the occasions on which courts should defer. Thus underequipped, the Court was left at sea when confronting multiple institutions competing for deference in the same case. At the same time, the law schools themselves may have fallen short in meeting their own obligations as deferees in this case. Finally, this Article shows that its examination <b>of</b> <b>deference</b> lies at the intersection of two developing areas of constitutional scholarship: the study of constitutional decision rules, and the study of institutionally oriented approaches to the First Amendment. It argues that these two emerging fields are linked by the concept <b>of</b> <b>deference,</b> and both might learn a good deal from each other. Reprinted by permission of the publisher...|$|R
