40|$|Consumer {{knowledge}} is seldom complete or errorless. Therefore, the self-assessed validity {{of knowledge and}} consequent knowledge calibration (i. e., the correspondence between self-assessed and actual validity) {{is an important issue}} for the study of consumer decision making. In this article we describe methods and models used in calibration research. We then review a wide variety of empirical results indicating that high levels of calibration are achieved rarely, moderate levels that include some degree of systematic bias are the norm, and confidence and accuracy are sometimes completely uncorrelated. Finally, we examine the explanations of miscalibration and offer suggestions for future research. Consumers are overconfident—they think they know more than they actually do. Our simple goal is to evaluate this proposition. Ultimately, we conclude that overconfidence is indeed a robust phenomenon and can be adopted by researchers as a stylized <b>fact</b> <b>about</b> <b>human</b> cognition; however, there are critical qualifications an...|$|R

40|$|It is {{frequently}} argued that research findings in empirical moral psychology spell trouble for Kantian ethics. Sometimes {{the charge is}} merely that Kantianism is mistaken {{about the role of}} emotions in human action, but it has also been argued that empirical moral psychology ‘debunks’ Kantian ethics as the product of precisely the emotion-driven processes it fails to acknowledge. In this essay I argue for a negative and a positive thesis. The negative thesis is that the ‘debunking’ argument against Kantian ethics is invalid because it begs the central question. The positive thesis is that, because the empirical <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> <b>human</b> moral psychology are morally significant, Kantians can and should wholeheartedly embrace the current interest in this area of empirical research. As Kant himself emphasized, it is an indirect, imperfect duty to use available knowledge of morally relevant empirical psychological conditions and to put this in the service of moral agency...|$|R

These two models are based on the same set of psychophysical <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> <b>human</b> vision. Therefore, they have a similar basic architecture and some similar mechanistic features. However, the Daly and the Sarnoff models take totally different approaches to modeling visual perception: the frequency domain approach and the spatial domain approach respectively.

5000|$|In its mature (1974) form, Homans's theory rests upon two metatheoretical claims: (1) {{the basic}} {{principles}} of social science must be true of individuals as members of the human species, not as members of particular groups or cultures; and (2) any other generalizations or <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> <b>human</b> social life will be derivable from these principles (and suitable initial conditions). He argued that large-scale structures can be understood if we understand elementary social behavior. Another way to grasp his argument is to interpret it as striving to explain spontaneous social order, a point developed in detail by Fararo (2001). Homans's approach is an example of methodological individualism in social science, also favored by some more recent influential social theorists, particularly those who have adopted some form of rational choice theory (e.g., James S. Coleman) that enables greater deductive fertility in theorizing—albeit often with a cost in terms of some loss of [...]|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} the <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> <b>human</b> stereo vision leads to the {{conclusion}} that the human stereo processing mechanism is very flexible in the presence of other depth cues. Stereopsis seems to provide only local additional depth information, rather than defining the overall 3 D geometry of a perceived scene. This paper reports on an experimental approach to adjusting stereo parameters automatically and thereby providing a low eye strain, easily accommodated stereo view for computer graphics applications. To this end the concept of virtual eye separation is defined. Experiment 1 shows that dynamic changes in virtual eye separation are not noticed if they occur over a period of a few seconds. Experiment 2 shows that when subjects are given control over their virtual eye separation, they change it depending on the amount of depth in the scene. Based partly on these results, an algorithm is presented for enhancing stereo depth cues for moving computer generated 3 D images. It has the effect of d [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A growth {{model with}} {{endogenous}} innovation and accumulation of high-tech and low- tech human capital is developed.

Under this new and reasonable assump- tion, our model also accounts for other previously established stylized facts. Both the evolution of human capital composition and the transition across stages of development are endogenously determined. We relate an increasing R&D activity and a negative relationship between income and the ratio of high to low-tech human capital, both present in developed countries, to {{the transition to a}} services economy.

40|$|Postulational {{approaches}} {{attempt to}} understand the dynamics of belief revision by appealing {{to no more than}} the set of beliefs held by an agent and the logical relations between them. It is argued there that such an approach cannot work. A proper account of belief revision must also appeal to the arguments supporting beliefs, and recognize that those arguments can be defeasible. If we begin with a mature epistemological theory that accommodates this, {{it can be seen that}} the belief revision operators on which the postulational theories are based are ill-defined. It is further argued that there is no way to repair the definitions so as to retain the spirit of those theory.

In this article, we discuss why the nature of human nature is relevant to anyone wishing to create a more just and humane workplace and society. We begin by presenting evolutionary psychology as a research framework, and then present three examples of research that illuminate various evolved cognitive programs. The first involves the cognitive foundations of trade, including a neurocognitive mechanism specialized for a form of moral reasoning: cheater detection. The second involves the moral sentiments triggered by participating in collective actions, which are relevant to organizational behavior. The third involves the evolved programs whereby our minds socially construct groups, and how these can be harnessed to reduce racism and foster true diversity in the workplace. In each case, we discuss how what has been learned about these evolved programs might inform th...|$|R
