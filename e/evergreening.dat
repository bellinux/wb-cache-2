25|$|Controversy exists {{regarding}} {{the effectiveness of}} escitalopram compared to its predecessor citalopram. The importance of this issue follows from the greater cost of escitalopram relative to the generic mixture of isomers citalopram prior to the expiration of the escitalopram patent in 2012, which led to charges of <b>evergreening.</b> Accordingly, this issue has been examined in at least 10 different systematic reviews and meta analyses. The most recent of these have concluded (with caveats in some cases) that escitalopram is modestly superior to citalopram in efficacy and tolerability.|$|E

50|$|The main {{arguments}} {{in favor of}} governments regulating against <b>evergreening</b> are that rapid entry of multiple generic competitors after patent expiry is likely to lower prices and facilitate competition, and that eventual loss of monopoly was part of the trade-off for the initial award of patent (or intellectual monopoly privilege) protection in the first place.|$|E

50|$|Recommendation 41 - The federal {{government}} should immediately review the pharmaceutical industry practices related to patent protection, specifically, the practices of <b>evergreening</b> and the notice of compliance regulations.

5000|$|<b>Evergreening</b> is not {{a formal}} concept of patent law; it is best {{understood}} as a social idea {{used to refer to}} the myriad ways in which pharmaceutical patent owners use the law and related regulatory processes to extend their high rent-earning intellectual property rights particularly over highly profitable (either in total sales volume or price per unit) [...] "blockbuster" [...] drugs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Evergreening</b> is any {{of various}} legal, {{business}} and technological strategies by which producers extend their patents over {{products that are}} about to expire, in order to retain royalties from them, by either taking out new patents (for example over associated delivery systems, or new pharmaceutical mixtures), or by buying out, or frustrating competitors, {{for longer periods of}} time than would normally be permissible under the law.|$|E

50|$|Thus, {{while the}} courts are an {{instrument}} frequently used by pharmaceutical brand name manufacturers to prolong their patent royalties, <b>evergreening</b> is rarely mentioned explicitly by judges in patent protection cases.
