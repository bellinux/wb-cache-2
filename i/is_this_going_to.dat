500|$|According to Selway, Radiohead's American label Capitol saw {{the album}} as [...] "more or less, 'commercial suicide'. They weren't really into it. At that point, {{we got the}} fear. How <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be received?" [...] According to Yorke, [...] "When we first gave [...] to Capitol, they were taken aback. I don't really know why it's so {{important}} now, but I'm excited about it." [...] Capitol lowered its sales forecast from two million units to a half a million. In O'Brien's view only Parlophone, the band's British label, remained optimistic while global distributors dramatically reduced their sales estimates. Label representatives were reportedly disappointed {{with the lack of}} potential marketable singles, especially the absence of anything resembling Radiohead's early hit [...] "Creep".|$|E

[...] In a 2002 Spin magazine article, Chuck Klosterman wondered, [...] "how can two media-savvy kids posing as brother and sister, wearing Dr. Seuss clothes, represent blood-and-bones Detroit, a city whose greatest resource is asphalt?" [...] However, in 2001, Benjamin Nugent with TIME magazine commented that [...] "it's hard to begrudge [...] his right to nudge the spotlight toward his band, and away from his private life, by any means available.

Brilliant introduced Burns to another specialist, W. Ian Lipkin. With the aid of these physicians, the producers were able to obtain additional perspectives from representatives of the World Health Organization. Burns also met with the author of [...] The Coming Plague, Laurie Garrett. Her 1995 book helped Burns consider a variety of potential plots for the film. He wanted to feature an official from the CDC, and ultimately decided to use an epidemiologist, since that role requires interacting with people while tracking the disease.|$|E

500|$|Production of {{the album}} began in summer of 2004 with Destiny's Child taking help from {{frequent}} collaborators including Rockwilder, Swizz Beatz and Rodney Jerkins. The group worked on the album within {{a period of three}} weeks. Jerkins, who had worked with Beyoncé for her solo album Dangerously in Love, concerned how he would manage the production, saying, [...] "How <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work?' Cause Beyoncé, she blew up solo, so how's it going to work in a group together?". He stated that once he got inside the studio, however, his skepticism vanished as he saw the group's [...] "excitement being back in the studio together", calling the process [...] "natural". The members of the group stated that the first week of recording was spent solely on conversations about the happenings in their lives while being apart from each other as they hadn't spent quaility time for a long period. This further inspired them to record the conversations and use it as the main theme of the record.|$|E

Mary Bono Mack of the United States Congress {{commented on}} the {{incident}}, [...] "How many times <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen before Congress finally wakes up and takes action? This latest incident once again brings into sharp focus the need to pass data protection legislation." [...] Senator Patrick Leahy said, [...] "Reports of another major data breach should give pause to American consumers who, now more than ever, share sensitive personal information in their online transactions and networking... Congress should make comprehensive data privacy and cybercrime legislation a top priority." [...] Marcus Carey, a security researcher for Rapid7, said that the hackers had penetrated the databases of LinkedIn in the preceding days. He expressed concerns {{that they may have}} had access to the website even after the attack. Michael Aronowitz, Vice President of Saveology said, [...] "Everyday hundreds of sites are hacked and personal information is obtained. Stealing login information from one account can easily be used to access other accounts, which can hold personal and financial information." [...] Security experts indicated that the stolen passwords were encrypted {{in a way that was}} fairly easy to decrypt, which was one of the reasons for the data breach. Katie Szpyrka, a long time user of LinkedIn from Illinois, United States, filed a $5 million lawsuit against LinkedIn, complaining that the company did not keep their promises to secure connections and databases. Erin O’Harra, a spokeswoman working for LinkedIn, when asked about the lawsuit, said that lawyers were looking to take advantage of that situation to again propose the bills SOPA and PIPA in the United States Congress. [...] An amended complaint was filed on Nov. 26, 2012 on behalf of Szpyrka and another premium LinkedIn user from Virginia, United States, named Khalilah Gilmore–Wright, as class representatives for all LinkedIn users who were affected by the breach. [...] The lawsuit sought injunctive and other equitable relief, as well as restitution and damages for the plaintiffs and members of the class.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{interior}} and exterior locations used to suit {{the needs of the}} story, were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Within a 5-month shooting schedule, 3 weeks were spent shooting at studio locations. Production designer Jack Collis, explained how the film integrates a minority group (the aliens) into the film saying, [...] "The idea was to bring in this alien group, assimilate them into our society, and get them a locale that would be a part of Los Angeles, ... It would look almost as if a group of Koreans or Vietnamese that had moved into the area. This group would have established their own community. They have their own language, their own signs." [...] The film crew installed fictional alien language signs along Western Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard. Colored drawings were made of all stores {{on both sides of the}} street for two full blocks. Painted and electrical signs were designed for each building. Graffiti was also carefully planned out. The film crew did their own painting and even took a big blank concrete wall and inserted alien graffiti for a scene involving an early physical confrontation between the main characters. Essentially, the alphabet of the alien citizens had to be designed as an integral part of their environment. He commented how the crew [...] "came up with individual alphabets and then combined them into certain words like, say, 'enter' and 'open', so that we could repeat them, ..." [...] while also mentioning how they [...] "brought in a language expert to give us something the actors could be comfortable with." [...] The Hawthorns, a well known family of sign painters, created most of the alien signs. Collis even mused how at one point, store owners liked, and wouldn't want to take down the alien graffiti used during filming on their properties. Collis recalled how the alien language resembled [...] "a flowing design more like hand writing than lettering, that looks almost like a heartbeat graph. Occasionally, we'd underline it as though it came from sort of electronic machine, like an IBM report. It turned out to be such a simple thing once we got it going, but we had to go through a process of 'what <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> look like?' before we got what we wanted." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} session with Stannard and Rowe, they wrote [...] "Feed Your Love", a slow, soulful song which was {{eventually}} recorded and mastered for the album but not released because it was considered too rude and racy for their target audience. Similarly, [...] "C U Next Tuesday", a song initially meant for the album, was never released supposedly due to the initials of the song's title spelling the word [...] "cunt" [...] which {{is considered by many}} to be vulgar. Having completed that session, the girls wanted to write something more uptempo, so they started to write the song that would be the lead of the album, [...] "Wannabe", which was recorded in under an hour—mainly because they had already written parts of the songs beforehand. The next song they recorded was a slow ballad and the third track on and single from the album, [...] "2 Become 1". The song was inspired by the special relationship which had developed between Halliwell and Rowe during the session. [...] "Mama" [...] was written by the Spice Girls with songwriting partners Matt Rowe and Richard Stannard. In an interview about the writing process between the group and the duo, Rowe credits Mel B as the one who came up with the song's concept. During the writing process, each member wrote a small verse in a different corner of the recording studio, while the chorus was finished around the piano with a guitar. Then, the producers added a gospel choir filled with the group's harmonies at the end of the song. In May 1995, the group was introduced to Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins, the songwriters and production duo known as Absolute. Watkins commented about their first meeting, [...] "They played us a few tracks, which we didn't particularly like. So we thought, this is OK. We can work with this." [...] A songwriting session was booked within the next few days at Absolute's studio located on Tagg's Island near Chertsey, but the musical association between them did not seem to go well at the beginning. Wilson remembered, [...] "When they started to sing it was never quite right: from our point of view. It was very poptastic." [...] Watkins recalled, [...] "After two sessions we phoned our managers and said 'This just ain't happening'." [...] It was at this point that Watkins and Wilson heard [...] "Wannabe" [...] for the first time. When speaking about the song, Wilson said, [...] "We listened to it and we didn't get it at all. It was so different to what we were doing. We thought <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work?".|$|E

A demon has entered into her: she used to be so quiet. I'd rather marry Miss Bangs without the dollars. Then it is all very well for Scremerston to yield to Venus Verticordia, and transfer his heart to this new enchantress. But, if I am not mistaken, the Earl himself is much more kind than kin.

At any rate, when the punkah stopped, Garin would first growl and cock his eye at the rope, and if that did not wake the man it nearly always did--he would tiptoe forth and talk in the sleeper's ear. Vixen was a clever little dog, but she could never connect the punkah and the coolie; so Garin gave me {{grateful}} hours of cool sleep.
