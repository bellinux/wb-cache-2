40|$|The UK {{provides}} a virtually unique {{environment in which}} to examine the information content of the partial provision approach to deferred tax accounting. In addition this issue {{is of particular interest}} to UK accounting standard setters in the light of trends towards international accounting standard harmonisation. Taking the total amount of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxation</b> to be equal to the partial balance sheet provision plus the potential portion appearing in the notes, this study tests the relationship between these various deferred tax components and market value. It also examines the economic rationale for the potential portion. The study is based on 1, 512 company/years from the period 1989 - 1991. It finds that, while the full amount of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxation</b> is not valued by the market as a liability, there is evidence of the partial balance sheet provision being so valued. There is also evidence that the potential portion is positively related to market value, consistent with its proxying for information about future growth. This result is supported by the positive relation between the potential portion and measures of future capital spending, indicative of an underlying economic rationale for this <b>deferred</b> <b>taxation</b> component. From a regulatory perspective, the study concludes that the main benefit of the partial provision approach is that the balance sheet amount constitutes a reasonably reliable measure of the portion likely to crystallise as a liability, information that would be lost were only the full amount to be disclosed.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{structure}} of optimal wedges and capital taxes in a Mirrlees economy with endogenous skills. Human capital is a private state variable that drives the skill process of each individual. Building {{on the findings of}} the labor literature, we assume that human capital investment is a) risky, b) made early in the life-cycle, and c) hard to distinguish from consumption. These assumptions lead to the optimality of a) a human capital premium, i. e., an excess return on human capital relative to physical capital, b) a large intertemporal wedge early in the life-cycle stemming from the lack of Rogerson's [Econometrica, 1985] "inverse Euler" characterization of the optimal consumption process, and c) an intra-temporal distortion of the effort/consumption margin even {{at the top of the}} skill distribution at all dates except the terminal date. The main implication for {{the structure of}} linear capital taxes is the necessity of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxation</b> of physical capital. In particular, <b>deferred</b> <b>taxation</b> of capital prevents the agents from making a joint deviation of under-investing in human capital ex ante and shirking from labor effort at some future date in the life-cycle, as the marginal deferred tax rate on physical capital held early in the life-cycle is history-dependent. The average marginal tax rate on physical capital held in every period is zero in present value. Thus, as in Kocherlakota [Econometrica, 2005], the government revenue from capital taxation is zero. However, since a portion of the capital tax must be deferred, expected capital tax payments cannot be zero in every period. Necessarily, agents face negative expected capital tax payments due early in the life-cycle and positive expected capital tax payments late in the life-cycle. Also, relative to economies with exogenous skills, the optimal marginal wealth tax rate is more volatile. Taxation...|$|E

50|$|Because {{the manager}} is {{compensated}} with carried interest, {{the bulk of}} his income from the fund is taxed as a return on investment and not as compensation for services. This tax treatment originated in {{the oil and gas industry}} of the early 20th century, when the actual oil exploration companies, which used financial partners' investments, had their profits taxed at the capital gains rate. This has been lower than the rate for ordinary income for much of the 20th century, in order to encourage risk and entrepreneurship. The logic was that the financial partners’ sweat equity had entailed the risk of loss, if their exploration did not pan out. Typically, a partner is not taxed upon receipt of a carried interest because it is difficult to measure the present value of an interest in future profits. In 1993, the Internal Revenue Service adopted this approach as a general administrative rule, and again in regulations proposed in 2005. Instead, the partner is taxed as the partnership earns income. In the case of a hedge fund, this means that the partner <b>defers</b> <b>taxation</b> on the income the hedge fund earns, which is typically ordinary income or possibly short-term capital gains, which are taxed the same as ordinary income due to the nature of the investments most hedge funds make. Private equity funds, however, typically invest on a longer horizon, with the result that their income is long-term capital gain, taxable to individuals at a maximum 20% rate. Because this compensation can reach enormous figures in the case of the most successful funds, concern has been raised in both the U.S. Congress and the media, that managers are taking advantage of tax loopholes to receive what is effectively a salary without paying the ordinary 39.6% marginal income tax rates a high-income person would have to pay on such income. the loophole’s total tax benefit for private-equity partners is estimated to be about $2 billion per year up to 14 or 16 billion dollars.|$|R

40|$|Executive {{pensions}} (or deferred compensation) grabbed headlines after Enron 2 ̆ 7 s {{collapse and}} fresh concerns over ever-increasing executive pay. They also grabbed {{the attention of}} Congress, which reformed executive pensions legislatively in 2004 with § 409 A of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 409 A merely tightens and clarifies the doctrines that had already governed executive pensions, leaving the basic economics of executive pensions unchanged. Executives can still <b>defer</b> <b>taxation</b> on current compensation until actual payment {{is made in the}} future. Deferral still comes at the same price to the employer, namely the deferral of its deduction for the compensation expense. Thus, the timing of deduction and inclusion are matched. Because of this matching, deferral has no tax advantage at all except in three scenarios: (1) where the executive faces lower tax rates in the future, (2) where the employer faces higher tax rates in the future, and (3) where the employer can earn higher after-tax investment returns than the executive can earn. The first scenario (higher future tax rate for executives) is the most compelling, as executives will often face lower tax rates in the future because retirement will bring an end to their prime earning years. The second scenario (lower future tax rate for employers) is less compelling, as corporate income does not have the same life cycle as executives 2 ̆ 7 income. The third scenario (greater ability for the employer to earn after-tax returns) is less compelling as well, given the lower tax rates that executives (but not corporate employers) pay on capital gains and dividend income. Thus, the primary problem of executive pensions is the temporal shifting of executive compensation from high-tax years to low-tax years. This temporal shifting is clearly allowed by current law, in contrast to personal shifting of compensation income from high-rate taxpayers to low-rate taxpayers. The policy concerns are largely the same, however, and the tax laws should limit the temporal shifting as well. The ideal response would be a system of accrual taxation on executive pensions. The second best would be taxing the delayed payment at the highest marginal tax rates that apply to individuals...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the Swedish CFC (Controlled foreign corporation) legislations compatibility with the EC law, freedom of establishment and towards those double taxation agreements that Sweden have signed with other states. The study is interesting and important for several reasons. There are two main ones. Fist of all; if the court in Luxemburg finds the CFC legislation not compatible with the freedom of establishment - the Swedish internal laws, in purpose of protecting tax avoidance by companies in tax havens, will suddenly be inoperative towards companies established inside the Union. Secondly; the same result will be a fact if the internal law is considered to be incompatible with the agreements that Sweden has signed with other states, in order to avoid double taxation. If the legislation is incompatible with the EC law, the problem is quite big, but anyway limited to the 25 countries that today constitute the Union. No quick or simple solution is to be found. If it is not compatible with the agreements, the problem is greater - since Sweden have 70 complete agreements - though, a problem simpler to solve. The purposes of the CFC legislation are to eliminate tax advantages of the shareholder when he transfers his earnings to a CFC corporation - or when he <b>defers</b> the <b>taxation</b> by postponing the dividend from the same corporation. Such postponement could otherwise be a fact, for all future. If the level of taxation, in the foreign corporation is lower than 15. 4 %, the incomes are considered to be a CFC income and are CFC taxed - if the owner holds 25 % control of the assets or votes of the corporation, directly or indirectly. The income is calculated according to Swedish rules for the same type of company and credit is given for taxes paid abroad. The Swedish exchange control was abolished in 1992. The control restrained the possibilities to establish enterprises abroad by prohibiting the export of securities or other means of payment without the consent of the bank of Sweden. The abolishment of exchange controls has provided opportunities for tax avoidance. To prevent such avoidance, many countries have introduced legislations that tax shareholders directly - even though the profits from the foreign controlled companies not yet have been distributed. Besides the restrains on foreign investments caused by the control, the CFC legislation was preceded by the less extensive “Luxemburg paragraph” - introduced in 1933. This paragraph has not much in common with today's legislation - the real means of preventing tax avoidance came with the CFC legislation 1990. The last decades have seen much more of harmful tax competition, and both the EU and the OECD have come up with strategies to tackle these problems. In order to prevent the problems, the organisations suggest the member states to introduce some form of CFC legislation. The first of July 2003 a new legislation came into effect, giving companies a right to bring back profits or earnings without taxation, if the companies are closely tied to each other or the possession of owning the company are due to dependence between them - when holding a kind of business related shares. Such rules were needed to avoid that some companies - or a combined groups of companies - would have to pay taxes three or four times for the same earnings. With the possibility of bringing profits and earnings back to Sweden tax free, a new possible problem occurred. According to the government, there was a risk that a company based in Sweden choose to have a loan of money in Sweden, only in order to transfer the money to a tax haven. The result would be that the cost would appear in Sweden while the earnings would appear in a low tax regime. Later, whenever it would be suitable, the earnings - or the profits from selling the foreign corporation - could be brought back to Sweden. In order to tackle such, and other, tax avoidance, Sweden introduced the new legislation for CFC companies, the first of January 2004. These rules are now the subject of analysis, in relation to the EC law, freedom of establishment, and the double taxation agreements, signed by Sweden.

An increasing gap was found between the reported profit under UK accounting principles and that restated under US GAAP. The difference lay most frequently in accounting for goodwill, provision for deferred tax, and the accounting treatment of pension costs, with accounting for goodwill showing a particularly significant impact in 1994.

40|$|A {{recently}} revived {{topic of}} interest in the economics literature has been the effect of certain aspects of goverment behaviour on the economy. In particular, {{it has been argued that}} increases in social security pension payments and the use of debt rather than tax finance for government spending both tend to depress savings, and thereby capital formation. These assertions contradict a long-standing neutrality theorem that dates back to David Ricardo. The essence of the early argument supporting neutrality was that individuals would only change their behaviour if the government action caused them to feel richer or poorer. Social security pensions involve a transfer from the young to the old. From the individual’s point of view he receives when he is old approximately what he pays in when young. Similarly, debt involves a <b>deferring</b> of current <b>taxation</b> for future taxation. The interest on the debt, like social security, involves a transfer from one group to another and thereby no net leakage from the system. The neutrality argument rested on the assertion that a rational man would be aware of these transfer implications, realise that he and his descendants were no better or worse off, and therefore not alter his behaviour. The modern explanation of neutrality, usually attributed to Robert Barro, is more complex. To begin with, it recognises that behaviour may alter even if life-time wealth is unaltered. The dominant impact of both social security and debt is an imposed rearranging of the individual’s life-time consumption pattern. Neutrality will only occur if the individual can undo these intertemporal allocation effects through his own behaviour. In this paper we show that if the economy behaves as a composite individual, then full neutrality is possible. Social security and debt both reduce consumption during youth and increase it during retirement; the rate of transfer being determined by the rate of population growth. However, if the economy has a system of operative intergenerational transfers (gifts or bequests) it is able to neutralise the reallocation effects by reversing the transfer, at a rate determined once again by the rate of population growth. This argument is only valid when we view the economy as a composite individual. The individuals themselves will not observe this perfect substitutability between social security, debt, and bequests due to corner solutions, illusions, and distribution effects. Whether or not the aggregate economy will display neutrality is an empirical question of the relative strengths of these forces. The paper reports the results of estimating savings functions using annual and quarterly data for the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s. On the basis of these equations we are unable to reject either of the neutrality hypotheses. The implications of these results are twofold: increases in the scale of our pension system should not be regarded as having a depressing effect on savings; and, the financing mix between taxes and debt is not important, in particular, there is no support for the argument that the public debt should be reduced by raising taxes. ...|$|R

Extensive income smoothing due to the flexible depreciation and inventory undervaluation practices has characterized Finnish accounting until the beginning of the 1990 s. The concept of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxation</b> has not been the central issue in Finnish accounting and there is no detailed regulation regarding accounting for it. Since the 1992 amendements, it has been allowed in group accounts to divide depreciation difference between tax and financial accounts and untaxed reserves into equity and deferred tax liability in balance sheets. To conclude, there has been very interesting interplay between the harmonization efforts, needs for international comparability, remaining tax dependence and the role of accounting theory in Finland. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{structure}} of optimal wedges and capital taxes in a dynamic Mirrlees economy with endogenous distribution of skills. Human capital is a private, stochastic state variable that drives the skill process of each individual. Building {{on the findings of}} the labor literature, we construct a tractable life-cycle model of human capital evolution with risky investment and stochastic depreciation. In this setting, we demonstrate the optimality of (a) a human capital premium, i. e., an excess return on human capital relative to physical capital, (b) a large intertemporal wedge early in the life-cycle, and (c) a non-zero intratemporal wedge even {{at the top of the}} skill distribution at all dates except the last date in the life-cycle. The main implication for {{the structure of}} optimal linear capital taxes is the necessity of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxation</b> of physical capital. The average marginal tax rate on physical capital held in every period is zero in present value. However, expected capital tax payments do not equal zero in every period. Necessarily, agents face negative expected capital tax payments early in the life-cycle and positive expected capital tax payments late in the life-cycle.
