40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{characteristics of}} a full scale executive type jet transport aircraft with a T-tail were investigated in a 40 x 80 ft (12. 2 by 24. 4 meter) wind tunnel (subsonic). Static, longitudinal, and lateral stability, and control characteristics were determined at angles of attack from - 2 deg to + 42 deg. The aircraft wing had 13 deg of sweep and an aspect ratio of 5. 02. The aircraft was tested power off with various wing leading- and trailing-edge high lift devices. The basic configuration was tested with and without such components as engine nacelles, wing tip tanks, and <b>empannage.</b> Hinge-moment data were obtained and downwash angles in the horizontal-tail plane location were calculated. The data were obtained at Reynolds numbers of 4. 1 million and 8. 7 million based on mean aerodynamic chord. The model had static longitudinal stability through initial stall. Severe tail buffet occurred near the angle of attack for maximum lift. Above initial stall the aircraft had pronounced pitch-up, characteristic of T-tail configurations. A stable trim point was possible at angles of attack between 30 deg and 40 deg (depending on c. g. location and flap setting). Hinge-moment data showed no regions with adverse effects on stick force. Comparisons of wind-tunnel data and flight-test are presented...|$|E
