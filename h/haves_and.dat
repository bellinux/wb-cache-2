5|$|First {{published}} in 2004 by Victor Gollancz Ltd, {{the book is}} Morgan's third novel, the first two {{being part of the}} Takeshi Kovacs series. Market Forces satirises corporate practices and globalisation and carries the theme of competition throughout the story. Violence is used {{as a metaphor for the}} mechanisms underlying capitalism and assumptions about <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> have-nots are challenged. It won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2005 and was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award. Though book reviewers gave it a mixed reception, Morgan's descriptive writing and action sequences received praise.|$|E

That same year he wrote Letters from England under the {{pseudonym}} Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella, an account of a tour supposedly from a foreigner's viewpoint. Through the mouth of his pseudonym Southey is critical of the disparity between the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> have-nots in English society, arguing that a change in taxation policy {{would be needed to}} foster a greater degree of equity.|$|E
25|$|Trade {{dramatically}} altered Duala society. European goods became status symbols, {{and some}} rulers appointed Western traders and missionaries as advisors. A {{high proportion of}} Duala grew wealthy through the new trade, and tensions arose between the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> have-nots. Competition escalated between coastal groups and even between related settlements. Traders exploited this atmosphere, and beginning in 1860, German, French, and Spanish merchants had established contacts and weakened the British monopoly. The Duala had gained a virtual hegemony over trade through the Wouri estuary.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} for the Chicago Tribune, Monáe {{said that she was}} inspired by the quote [...] "The mediator between the hand and the mind is always the heart" [...] for the record. She discussed her incorporation of the android as a metaphor for a minority, whilst being the role of the story's protagonist also. In {{an interview}} for Blues & Soul, Monáe said [...] "she represents the MEDIATOR between the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> the have-nots, the minority and the majority. So in that way she’s very similar to Neo, the Archangel from The Matrix. And basically her return will mean freedom for the android community".|$|E
500|$|Former {{legislator}} Albert Cheng {{noted that}} had Bokhary been charged under the Police Ordinance, {{and not the}} Offences Against the Person Ordinance, she would have faced a custodial sentence of up to two years; furthermore, the police failed to charge Bokhary for allegedly assaulting a policewoman {{at the police station}} after her arrest; the police also prosecuted her for careless driving instead of the more serious offence of dangerous driving. Cheng said: [...] "The public certainly has the right to voice its anger against any injustice. But, in this case, its targets shouldn't be the government or the courts, but Secretary for Justice Wong Yan-lung, who is responsible for prosecutions and all government legal matters." [...] Legislator and former Secretary for Security, Regina Ip, said: [...] "At the end of the day, the sense of outrage is not about justice and penalties, but about the widening inequality between rich and poor, between the corporate giant and the artless individual, and the yawning asymmetry of money, knowledge and expert power between the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> have-nots of our society." [...] Political commentator Michael Chugani agreed that public anger existed due to the belief that Hong Kong society had become too unfair, and that the verdict was confirmation to some of this view. He said that the public outrage responsible for forcing the Department of Justice to appeal against Bokhary's sentence was unlikely to result in a happy ending because both outcomes were potentially damaging: the jailing of Bokhary would imply the judicial system had succumbed to public pressure; if she was not jailed, the system would be tarnished by accusations of favouritism.|$|E

40|$|This essay explores Hemingway’s {{depiction}} {{of women in}} the novel To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> Not. In To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> Not, the novel explored in this essay, traits of Hemingway’s renowned sexist {{depiction of}} women <b>have</b> been investigated, <b>and</b> the purpose of the essay was to illuminate that the women of To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> Not are reduced to roles which resembles Simone de Beauvoir’s observations, namely the perception of women as the Other, assuming subordinate roles. In order to achieve this task, a close reading has been done on Hemingway’s novel To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> Not, <b>and</b> his portrayal of five female characters in the novel has been analyzed. Simone de Beauvoir’s theory has been applied for an understanding of these female characters in order to see if these women were portrayed in a manner resembling de Beauvoir notions, that is, marked by patriarchal perspectives. The conclusion drawn in this essay is that all the women in the novel are portrayed as "absolute sex", subordinated to men. Thus, the depictions {{of the women in the}} novel To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> Not were found to correspond to patriarchal gender roles as described by Simone de Beauvoir...|$|R
2500|$|By the 1930s, when Rowland Brown {{enjoyed his}} [...] "fifteen minutes of fame." [...] the {{atmosphere}} {{had changed in}} a number of important ways. The movie industry was subdued by the establishment of regulatory laws, the rise of unions and guilds, and increasing enforcement of the Motion Picture Production Code. The Production Code brought censorship and restriction of content in a time of turmoil that challenged the foundations of American society. The stock market had crashed, taking the roar out of the Twenties, causing widespread unemployment and widening the gap between the <b>Haves</b> <b>and</b> Have-nots.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{was also}} {{reportedly}} seeking coalition with whites {{in order to}} approach what were considered racial problems as economic and class problems, [...] "When we change the race problem into a class fight between the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> the have-nots, then {{we are going to}} have a new ball game", he said. In the 21st century, some public school systems are working on an approach for affirmative action that deals with family income rather than race, recognizing that some minority members have been very successful. The Times also indicated that Jackson was being criticized as too involved with middle-class blacks, and for having an unattainable goal of racial unity.|$|E
2500|$|The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) {{conducted}} the first survey to assess Internet usage among what the study deemed the 'haves' and the 'have-nots' of American society in 1995. After U.S. President Bill Clinton adopted the phrase, [...] "the digital divide" [...] in his 2000 State of the Union address, researchers have identified numerous origins and aversions explaining trends in access and usage {{of information and}} communication technologies between the groups of United States' <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> have-nots. Over the past decade, several of these demographic access and usage gaps have narrowed, or closed altogether, while others continue to show a lack of connectivity for the group; these include gaps {{on the basis of race}} and ethnicity and income.|$|E

2500|$|Author and journalist, Peter Sacks, narrows the {{argument}} by suggesting a direct {{correlation between the}} wealth of school and its rank. He suggests that [...] "the ranking amounts {{to little more than}} a pseudo-scientific and yet popularly legitimate tool for perpetuating inequality between educational <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> have nots -- the rich families from the poor ones, and the well-endowed schools from the poorly endowed ones. Toss in the most heavily weighted factor in the U.S. News survey, the assessment of deans, college presidents, admissions officials and others regarding their peer institutions (a beauty contest that constitutes a full 25 percent of the U.S. News ranking), and you get the perfect recipe for a self-perpetuating, class-based rankings system driven by brand names, marketing hype, and prestige." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Telegraph {{published}} {{an interview with}} Monáe, talking about her first studio album, in which the journalist Bernadette McNulty said, [...] "I begin to worry {{for a moment that}} Monáe may not just be a humourless science-fiction nerd, but actually an android herself, created in a laboratory as a super-musical cross between James Brown, Judy Garland, André 3000 and Steve Jobs, invented to test the desperate incredulity of music journalists." [...] She also compared Monáe to artists such as Annie Lennox, Lauryn Hill, and Corinne Bailey Rae. Her musical styles have been described as [...] "a soaring orchestral trip enlivened with blockbuster vocals, mysterious imagery and notes of Sixties pop and jazz". The Guardian has noted some of her influences as: Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Prince, Outkast, Erykah Badu, James Brown, Grace Jones, Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Jimi Hendrix, Bernard Herrmann, Funkadelic and the Incredible String Band. Matthew Valnes likens her dancing style in the music video for [...] "Tightrope", to that of James Brown. In an opinion piece for The Quietus, John Calvert places Janelle Monáe within the Afrofuturism movement, pointing out her similarities to Sun Ra and George Clinton. He asserts that Janelle Monáe is innovating the genre. Monáe has stated that she has an alter-ego named Cindi Mayweather who according to Monáe is from the year 2719. In [...] she gave her alter-ego a back-story stating that she was on the run after breaking the law in her home town of Metropolis by falling in love with a human named Anthony Greendown. Monáe explained about Cindi, saying [...] "The Archandroid, Cindi, is the mediator, between the mind and the hand. She's the mediator between the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> the have-nots, the oppressed and the oppressor. She's like the Archangel in the Bible, and what Neo represents to the Matrix." [...] In her second album, Cindi Mayweather returned to Earth to liberate Metropolitans from the Great Divide, an oppressive oligarchy that used time travel to [...] "suppress freedom and love". Chris Champion of The Observer described Metropolis and The ArchAndroid as [...] "psychedelic soul with a sci-fi twist". Matthew Valnes describes Monáe as innovating a more contemporary Neo-Afrofuturism, where her android role is used as a tool to critique the representation of Black female musicians in the funk genre. Funk music of the 1960's through the 1980's is a prevalent music style influencing Monáe. On the website for Monáe's Wondaland Arts Society Collective, they assert [...] "We believe there are only three forms of music; good music, bad music, and funk." [...] Monáe has also referred to herself as a [...] "funkstress".|$|E
6000|$|The {{injustice}} {{of the existing}} set of rules simply appals the Radical. Yet oddly enough, this injustice itself appeals rather to the comparative looker-on than to the heavily-handicapped players in person. They, poor creatures, dragging their log in patience, have grown so accustomed to regarding the world as another man's oyster, that they put up uncomplainingly {{for the most part}} with the most patent inequalities. Perhaps 'tis their want of imagination that makes them unable to conceive any other state of things as even possible--like the dog who accepts kicking as the natural fate of doghood. At any rate, you will find, if you look about you, that the chief reformers are not, as a rule, the ill-used classes themselves, but the sensitive and thinking souls who hate and loathe the injustice with which others are treated. Most of the best Radicals I have known were men of gentle birth and breeding. Not all: others, just as earnest, just as eager, just as chivalrous, sprang from the masses. Yet the gently-reared preponderate. It is a common Tory taunt to say that the battle is one between the <b>Haves</b> <b>and</b> the Have-nots. That is by no means true. It is between the selfish Haves, on one side, and the unselfish Haves, who wish to see something done for the Have-nots, on the other. As for the poor Have-nots themselves, they are mostly inarticulate. Indeed, the Tory almost admits as much when he alters his tone and describes the sympathising and active few as [...] "paid agitators." ...|$|E

6000|$|Clearly a {{difficult}} 'point' for Government, that {{of dealing with}} these masses;--if indeed it be not rather the sole point and problem of Government, and all other points mere accidental crotchets, superficialities, and beatings of the wind! For let Charter-Chests, Use and Wont, Law common and special say what they will, the masses count to so many millions of units; made, to all appearance, by God,--whose Earth this is declared to be. Besides, the people are not without ferocity; they have sinews and indignation. Do but look what holiday old Marquis Mirabeau, the crabbed old friend of Men, looked on, in these same years, from his lodging, at the Baths of Mont d'Or: 'The savages descending in torrents from the mountains; our people ordered not to go out. The Curate in surplice and stole; Justice in its peruke; Marechausee sabre in hand, guarding the place, till the bagpipes can begin. The dance interrupted, in {{a quarter of an}} hour, by battle; the cries, the squealings of children, of infirm persons, and other assistants, tarring them on, as the rabble does when dogs fight: frightful men, or rather frightful wild animals, clad in jupes of coarse woollen, with large girdles of leather studded with copper nails; of gigantic stature, heightened by high wooden-clogs (sabots); rising on tiptoe to see the fight; tramping time to it; rubbing their sides with their elbows: their faces haggard (figures <b>haves),</b> <b>and</b> covered with their long greasy hair; {{the upper part of the}} visage waxing pale, the lower distorting itself into the attempt at a cruel laugh and a sort of ferocious impatience. And these people pay the taille! And you want further to take their salt from them! And you know not what it is you are stripping barer, or as you call it, governing; what by the spurt of your pen, in its cold dastard indifference, you will fancy you can starve always with impunity; always till the catastrophe come!--Ah Madame, such Government by Blindman's-buff, stumbling along too far, will end in the General Overturn (culbute generale).
