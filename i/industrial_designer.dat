5|$|The {{practice}} of managing design {{to achieve a}} business objective was first documented in 1907. The Deutscher Werkbund (German Work Federation) was established in Munich by twelve architects and twelve business firms as a state-sponsored effort to better compete with Great Britain and the United States by integrating traditional craft and industrial mass-production techniques. A German designer and architect, Peter Behrens, created the entire corporate identity (logotype, product design, publicity, etc.) of Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft (AEG), and {{is regarded as the}} first <b>industrial</b> <b>designer</b> in history. His work for AEG was the first large-scale demonstration of the viability and vitality of the Werkbund's initiatives and objectives and can be considered as first contribution to design management.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} years, companies applied {{the principles of}} corporate identity and corporate design to increase awareness and recognition by consumers and differentiation from competitors. Olivetti became famous for its attention to design through their corporate design activities. In 1936 Olivetti hired Giovanni Pintori in their publicity department and promoted Marcello Nizzoli from the product design department to develop design in a comprehensive corporate philosophy. In 1956, inspired by the compelling brand character of Olivetti, Thomas Watson, Jr., CEO of IBM, retained American architect and <b>industrial</b> <b>designer</b> Eliot Noyes to develop a corporate-wide IBM Design Program consisting of coherent brand-design strategy together with a design management system to guide and oversee the comprehensive brand identity elements of: products, graphics, exhibits, architecture, interiors and fine art. This seminal effort by Noyes, with his inclusion of Paul Rand and Charles Eames as consultants, {{is considered to be}} the first comprehensive corporate design program in America. Up to and during the 1960s, debates in the design community were focused on ergonomics, functionalism, and corporate design, while debates in management addressed Just in time, Total quality management, and product specification. The main proponents of design management at that time were AEG, Bauhaus, HfG Ulm, the British Design Council, Deutscher Werkbund, Olivetti, IBM, Peter Behrens, and Walter Paepcke.|$|E

Through interviews with <b>industrial</b> <b>designers,</b> the basic requirements for support of such functionality during conceptual design have been formulated.

40|$|The central {{question}} for {{this paper is}} how to improve the production process by closing the gap between <b>industrial</b> <b>designers</b> and software engineers of television(TV) -based User Interfaces (UI) in an industrial environment. Software engineers are highly interested whether one UI design can be converted into several fully functional UIs for TV products with different screen properties. The aim of the software engineers is to apply automatic layout and scaling in order to speed up and improve the production process. However, {{the question is whether}} a UI design lends itself for such automatic layout and scaling. This is investigated by analysing a prototype UI design done by <b>industrial</b> <b>designers.</b> In a first requirements study, <b>industrial</b> <b>designers</b> had created meta annotations on top of their UI design in order to disclose their design rationale for discussions with software engineers. In a second study, <b>industrial</b> <b>designers</b> assessed the potential of four different meta annotation approaches. The question was which annotation method <b>industrial</b> <b>designers</b> would prefer and whether it could satisfy the technical requirements of the software engineering process. One main result is that the <b>industrial</b> <b>designers</b> preferred the method they were already familiar with, which therefore seems to be the most effective one although the main objective of automatic layout and scaling could still not be achieved. 1...|$|R

25|$|All {{versions}} of the SNES are predominantly gray, of slightly different shades. The original North American version, designed by Nintendo of America <b>industrial</b> <b>designer</b> Lance Barr (who previously redesigned the Famicom to become the NES), has a boxy design with purple sliding switches and a dark gray eject lever. The loading bay surface is curved, both to invite interaction and to prevent food or drinks from being placed on the console and spilling as had happened with the flat surfaced NES. The Japanese and European versions are more rounded, with darker gray accents and buttons. The North American SNS-101 model and the Japanese Super Famicom Jr. (model SHVC-101), all designed by Barr, are both smaller with a rounded contour; however, the SNS-101 buttons are purple where the Super Famicom Jr. buttons are gray.

25|$|The Wii Remote uses two AA {{batteries}} {{as a power}} source, {{which can}} power a Wii Remote for 60 hours using only the accelerometer functionality and 25 hours using both accelerometer and pointer functionality. In May 2013, Nintendo announced a rechargeable battery and dock accessory, and various third-party manufacturers market charging solutions for the controller (see Wii Remote Chargers). According to an interview with Nintendo <b>industrial</b> <b>designer</b> Lance Barr, limitations of the Wii Remote's expansion port make it unlikely {{that it will be}} used for internal battery charging. Although Nintendo discourages other rechargeable battery types such as lithium ion (Li-ion) and nickel-cadmium (NiCd), the company's support website indicates that nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batteries may be used. A 3300µF capacitor provides a temporary source of power during quick movements of the Wii Remote when connection to the batteries may be temporarily interrupted. If the Wii Remote is not used for more than 5 minutes, such as when the player is using a GameCube controller or watching Netflix, it will shut off, and can be re-activated by pressing any button.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIndustrial {{designers}} and engineers are 2 types {{of individuals who}} are typically contrasted {{with regard to their}} creative capabilities. Regarding idea-generation processes, studies have shown that individuals use existing elements to generate new ideas, which constrains their creative thinking and leads them to only focus on a narrow scope of solutions. This article explores how <b>industrial</b> <b>designers</b> and engineers behave when generating creative ideas and resisting fixation (i. e., their propensity to focus on a limited set of ideas). We used a creative task in which participants were asked to design a solution that would prevent a hen’s egg from breaking after being dropped from a height of 10 m. Our results show that engineers and <b>industrial</b> <b>designers</b> differ in their creative behaviors when they are asked to generate ideas in a creative task without any constraints. <b>Industrial</b> <b>designers</b> provide more answers and are less fixated than engineers. However, for both engineers and <b>industrial</b> <b>designers,</b> the introduction of an uncreative example reinforced the fixation effect and constrained participants’ fluency. Specifically, <b>industrial</b> <b>designers</b> who were exposed to an uncreative example behaved similarly to engineers who were not exposed to this type of example...|$|R
