25|$|In mathematics, France {{uses the}} <b>infix</b> <b>notation</b> like most {{countries}}. For large numbers the long scale is used. Thus, the French {{use the word}} billion for the number 1,000,000,000,000, which in countries using short scale is called a trillion. However, there exists a French word, milliard, for the number 1,000,000,000, which in countries using the short scale is called a billion. Thus, despite {{the use of the}} long scale, one billion is called un milliard ("one milliard") in French, and not mille millions ("one thousand million"). It {{should also be noted that}} names of numbers above the milliard are rarely used. Thus, one trillion will most often be called mille milliards ("one thousand milliard") in French, and rarely un billion.|$|E

Implemented in Javascript, MathEdit works with IE and the Mozilla-family browsers and provides an easy-to-use GUI {{as well as}} an API for Javascript programs. MathEdit works with MathML and <b>infix</b> <b>notations.</b> By simply embedding the MathEdit tool, authors can add interactive entering, editing and manipulating mathematical expressions to their Web pages. MathEdit provides MathML-Content based and MathML-Presentation based editing as well as different visual navigation models for displayed expressions. The GUI appearance, menus and buttons, as well as other aspects of MathEdit can be customized through the API. Serialized forms (infix and MathML for now) of user created expressions can be transmitted to other programs for further processing. ...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Lisp has {{traditionally}} been a language that eschews complex syntax. According to John McCarthy, the inventor of Lisp: This internal representation of symbolic information gives up the familiar <b>infix</b> <b>notations</b> {{in favor of a}} notation that simplifies the task of programming the substantive computations, e. g., logical deduction or algebraic simplification, differentiation or integration. If customary notations are to be used externally, translation programs must be written. Thus LISP programs use a prefix notation for algebraic expressions, because they usually must determine the main connective before deciding what to do next. In this, LISP differs from almost every other symbolic computation system. [...] . This feature probably accounts for LISP's success in competition with these languages, especially when large programs have to be written. The advantage is like that of binary computers over decimal [...] -but larger. [...] . A...|$|R
