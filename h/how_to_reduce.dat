25|$|Also in 1969 {{computer}} scientist Alvy Ray Smith completed a Stanford PhD dissertation on Cellular Automata Theory, the first mathematical treatment of CA {{as a general}} class of computers. Many papers came from this dissertation: He showed the equivalence of neighborhoods of various shapes, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> a Moore to a von Neumann neighborhood or <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> any neighborhood to a von Neumann neighborhood. He proved that two-dimensional CA are computation universal, introduced 1-dimensional CA, and showed that they too are computation universal, even with simple neighborhoods. He showed how to subsume the complex von Neumann proof of construction universality (and hence self-reproducing machines) into a consequence of computation universality in a 1-dimensional CA. Intended as {{the introduction to the}} German edition of von Neumann's book on CA, he wrote a survey of the field with dozens of references to papers, by many authors in many countries over a decade or so of work, often overlooked by modern CA researchers.|$|E

25|$|Eating the chickling pea with grain having high {{concentrations}} of sulphur-based amino acids {{reduces the risk of}} lathyrism if grain is available. Food preparation is also an important factor. Toxic amino acids are readily soluble in water and can be leached. Bacterial (lactic acid) and fungal (tempeh) fermentation is useful to reduce ODAP content. Moist heat (boiling, steaming) denatures protease inhibitors which otherwise add to the toxic effect of raw grasspea through depletion of protective sulfur amino acids. During times of drought and famine, water for steeping and fuel for boiling is frequently also in short supply. Poor people sometimes know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the chance of developing lathyrism but face a choice between risking lathyrism or starvation.|$|E
25|$|The AMC Cavalier {{was unique}} in that the vehicle was a study in symmetry. It was built to {{demonstrate}} the use of numerous interchangeable body panels. For example, the fenders were identical (the opposite ends, e.g. left front and right rear). The doors were similarly shared with opposite sides (an idea originated by Cord on its prototype 935 Saloon) since the rear doors were hinged in the back (suicide door). The hood and decklid were also interchangeable. The Nash Metropolitan, which was sold by AMC up to 1962, also had interchangeable inner panels, but their outer skins were different. In addition to reducing tooling costs by thirty percent, the design objective of the AMC Cavalier was also to demonstrate <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the costs of production.|$|E

25|$|Tree {{alignment}} {{problem is}} a NP-hard problem when we restrict its scoring mode and alphabet size, {{and it can be}} found an algorithm, which uses to find the optimized solution. However, there is an exponential relationship between its efficiency and the number of sequence, it means when the number of sequence is very large, the runtime before getting results is an enormous figure and it is unacceptable. Using star alignment is faster than tree alignment to get the approximate optimized solution. However, whatever the degree of multiple-sequence similarity is, the time complexity of star alignment has a proportional relationship with the square of sequence number and the square of the sequence average length. In usual, the sequence in MSA is so long that it is also inefficient or even unacceptable. Therefore, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the time complexity to linear is one of the core issues in the Tree alignment.|$|E
500|$|Another {{important}} strategic {{question in}} the middlegame is whether and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> material and transition into an endgame (i.e. [...] ). Minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame, and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending. Not every reduction of material is good for this purpose; for example, if one side keeps a light-squared bishop and the opponent has a dark-squared one, the transformation into a bishops and pawns ending is usually advantageous for the weaker side only, because an endgame with bishops on opposite colors {{is likely to be}} a draw, even with an advantage of a pawn, or sometimes even with a two-pawn advantage.|$|E
