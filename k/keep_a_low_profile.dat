5|$|In May 1914, {{two months}} before war broke out, Lody was {{approached}} by German naval intelligence officials. He agreed to their proposal to employ him as a peacetime spy in southern France, but {{the outbreak of the}} First World War on 28 July 1914 resulted in a change of plans. In late August, he was sent to the United Kingdom with orders to spy on the Royal Navy. He posed as an American — he could speak English fluently, with an American accent — using a genuine U.S. passport purloined from an American citizen in Germany. Over the course of a month, Lody travelled around Edinburgh and the Firth of Forth observing naval movements and coastal defences. By the end of September 1914, he was becoming increasingly worried for his safety as a rising spy panic in Britain led to foreigners coming under suspicion. He travelled to Ireland, where he intended to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> until he could make his escape from the UK.|$|E

25|$|He was {{archbishop}} for 42 years, unparalleled in Sweden, {{and during}} his time he was often in conflicts with the monarchs. In 1539 his brother Olaus {{was sentenced to death}} by the King over some arguments, and Laurentius was among those forced to sign the death sentence. It has been disputed whether Laurentius was doing this because of a weak character or if he thought it better to formally obey so that he could continue to spread the reformation ideas. Olaus did eventually get pardoned in 1542, much due to his influential friends, but he was forced to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>profile,</b> leaving the role of main reformator solely to Laurentius.|$|E

25|$|With {{his father}} growing weaker, Phan decided to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> to avoid {{trouble with the}} French colonials {{so that he could}} support his family. He did so by {{teaching}} and writing, while still continually preparing for examinations. During this time, he quietly acquired books on military strategy by the likes of Sun Tzu and Đào Duy Từ, the military strategist of the Nguyễn lords who stopped the Trịnh lords with a defensive wall, and Trần Hưng Đạo, the military commander of the Trần Dynasty who repelled Mongol invasions of Vietnam in the 13th century. Phan cultivated a small number of his students whom he identified as having abundant pro-independence sentiments. He enthusiastically received visits from Cần Vương visitors and passed on their tales to his students, particularly those concerning Phan Đình Phùng, who led the Cần Vương effort.|$|E
25|$|Beyond the {{immediate}} danger of an Egyptian attack on its inadequate defenses, however, Israel also faced two additional threats. First, the massing of forces along {{both sides of}} the border could, even inadvertently, deteriorate into open warfare. Furthermore, a massive Egyptian presence on the border would force Israel to maintain its forces, mostly reserve troops, in the south for an indeterminate amount of time, a drain on national resources. These could also have repercussions on other points of conflict, such as Israeli shipping in the Red Sea. Ben-Gurion had refused a massive call-up of reservists in order to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> and prevent actions that might be deemed provocative, and also refused to allow additional reconnaissance flights over the Sinai. Censorship prevented the media from reporting the heightened state-of-alert, and Ben-Gurion met with newspaper editors to brief them on what they should not report.|$|E
25|$|Even though Sheila's {{body had}} been removed from the closet, the smell of {{decomposition}} still lingered in the apartment. Knorr became concerned that the smell and physical evidence in the closet could implicate her in Sheila's death. On September 29, 1986, Knorr moved the family's belongings out of the home and ordered her youngest daughter Terry to burn down the apartment in an effort to destroy any physical evidence. During the night, Terry Knorr dumped three containers of lighter fluid on the apartment floor and set it on fire. The fire did little damage as neighbors quickly reported the fire before it spread. The closet in which Sheila died was not damaged. After Knorr's arrest, investigators were able to remove the subfloor from the closet to test it for physical evidence. After leaving the Sacramento apartment, Knorr went into hiding. Her surviving children, who were by then of legal age, severed their ties with their mother. Knorr's youngest child, 16-year-old Terry, also left her mother's care and used Sheila's identification card to pass herself off as a legal adult. The only child to remain with Knorr was Robert, Jr. who was then 19 years old. Knorr and Robert, Jr. moved to Las Vegas and attempted to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>profile.</b> In November 1991, Robert Knorr, Jr. was arrested after he fatally shot a bartender in a Las Vegas bar during an attempted robbery.

500|$|During her pregnancy, Cynthia and John {{were offered}} {{the use of}} Epstein's flat at 36 Falkner Street, and later paid for a private {{hospital}} room when the pregnancy was coming to term. Although still completely unknown outside Liverpool, by now the Beatles had a fanatical following among girls within the city. Epstein had one condition which the Lennons had to follow: the marriage and the baby were to be kept a close secret, {{so as not to}} upset any of these fans.

500|$|Firefly {{maintained}} an ensemble cast that portrayed nine crew members and passengers of the ship, Serenity.

The crew is driven by the need to secure enough income to keep their ship operational, set against their need to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> to avoid their adversaries. Their situation is greatly complicated by the divergent motivations of the individuals on board Serenity, but complex characterization was hampered by the show's brief run.|$|E

Patton frequently kept his face in a scowl he referred to as his [...] "war face". He would arrive in a Mercedes and deliver his remarks on a raised platform surrounded by a very large audience seated around the platform and on surrounding hills. Each address was delivered to a division-sized force of 15,000 or more men.|$|E
