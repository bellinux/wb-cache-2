He {{had taken}} holy orders in 1687, preached {{occasionally}} in London with an eloquence which raised his reputation, and was soon appointed one of the royal chaplains. He ordinarily lived at Oxford, {{where he was the}} chief adviser and assistant of Henry Aldrich, under whom Christ Church was a stronghold of Toryism. He inspired a pupil, Charles Boyle, in the Examination of Dr. Bentley's Dissertations on the Epistles of Phalaris, an attack (1698) on the Whig scholar Richard Bentley, arising out <b>of</b> Bentley's <b>impugnment</b> <b>of</b> the genuineness of the Epistles of Phalaris. He was figured by Swift in the Battle of the Books as the Apollo who directed the fight, and was, no doubt, largely the author of Boyle's essay. Bentley spent two years in preparing his famous reply, which owned not only that the letters ascribed to Phalaris were spurious, but that all Atterbury's wit and eloquence were a cloak for an audacious pretence at scholarship.|$|R

It {{suffered}} no worse mischance, however, than to be prompted to intenser communion with itself. Richard de Mauves was the hero of the young girl's romance made real, and so completely accordant with this creature of her imagination that she felt afraid of him almost as she would have been of a figure in a framed picture who should have stepped down from the wall. He was now thirty-three--young enough to suggest possibilities of ardent activity and old enough to have formed opinions that a simple woman might deem it an intellectual privilege to listen to. He was perhaps a trifle handsomer than Euphemia's rather grim Quixotic ideal, but a very few days reconciled her to his good looks as effectually they would have reconciled her to a characterised want of them. He was quiet, grave, eminently distinguished. He spoke little, but his remarks, without being sententious, had a nobleness of tone that caused them to re-echo in the young girl's ears {{at the end of the}} day. He paid her very little direct attention, but his chance words--when he only asked her if she objected to his cigarette--were accompanied by a smile of extraordinary kindness.|$|R

In the system of free assessment the judge is the one to evaluate the evidence without being bound by any formal rules on probative value <b>of</b> certain <b>evidence.</b> Probative value depends only on individual belief or conviction of the trial judge in each matter separately. The free assessment <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> is the right and duty of the court to assess each piece <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> separately and collectively. In the evidence-taking stage the CPA includes the special rules for each type <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> meant as a minimum guarantee for the right free assessment <b>of</b> the taken <b>evidence</b> and the free assessment <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> presupposes that the evidence were taken by this rules.

The first chapter deals with general aspects <b>of</b> rules <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> explaining basic terminology and basic principles that dominate the law <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> division <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> and general rules on admissibility <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> as covered by the only explicit condition which {{is provided by the}} Criminal code of proceedings (that is that evidence shall not be acquired by compulsion or by threat of thereof) and by contemporary legal theory. The second chapter deals with particular forms <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> such as examination of the defendant, examination <b>of</b> witnesses, expert <b>evidence,</b> polygraph and monitoring of telecommunication and the rules that govern them.
