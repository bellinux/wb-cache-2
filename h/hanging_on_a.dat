Although the medieval writer Walter Map said that Baldwin was determined to continue writing even after his election to the bishopric, none of Baldwin's writings can be dated to his time as bishop except for one sermon.|$|E
5|$|Madonna's {{performance}} of the song during the 2006 Confessions Tour was controversial. She was raised from the floor <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> mirrored cross wearing a red blouse and velvet pants, with a crown of thorns on her head. During the performance, the number 12million flashed above her on the stage's backdrop screens, along with images of African children.

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she did {{when she was younger}} as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white dress with a thin belt around the waist.|$|E

25|$|A simple {{seismometer}} that {{is sensitive}} to up-down motions of the earth can be understood by visualizing a weight <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> spring. The spring and weight are suspended from a frame that moves along with the earthʼs surface. As the earth moves, the relative motion between the weight and the earth provides {{a measure of the}} vertical ground motion. If a recording system is installed, such as a rotating drum attached to the frame, and a pen attached to the mass, this relative motion between the weight and earth can be recorded to produce a history of ground motion, called a seismogram.|$|E
25|$|Black powder {{made with}} less-expensive and more {{plentiful}} sodium nitrate (in appropriate proportions) works just as well, and previous equations apply, with sodium instead of potassium. However, {{it is more}} hygroscopic than powders made from potassium nitrate—popularly known as saltpeter. Because corned black powder grains made with saltpeter are less affected by moisture in the air, they can be stored unsealed without degradation by humidity. Muzzleloaders {{have been known to}} fire after <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wall for decades in a loaded state, provided they remained dry. By contrast, black powder made with sodium nitrate must be kept sealed to remain stable.|$|E

25|$|For this reason, Bauman {{argues that}} modern {{societies}} have not fully taken {{on board the}} lessons of the Holocaust; it is generally viewed – to use Bauman's metaphor – like a picture <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wall, offering few lessons. In Bauman's analysis, the Jews became 'strangers' par excellence in Europe; the Final Solution was pictured by him as an extreme example of the attempts made by societies to excise the uncomfortable and indeterminate elements existing within them. Bauman, like the philosopher Giorgio Agamben, contended that the same processes of exclusion that were at work in the Holocaust could, and to an extent do, still come into play today.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} then {{approaches a}} dark area and stops. Indiana Jones suddenly appears above the vehicle <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rope in {{a shaft of}} light. He welcomes the adventurers' rescue and bids them {{to turn on the}} headlights and prepare for him to board. As the lights flicker on, they illuminate a massive boulder rolling toward the transport. The transport seems to back up as the boulder threatens to crush Jones and the tourists. At the last possible second, the transport accelerates and suddenly the floor seems to give way, sending the transport into the chamber below. An impact resonates through the chamber, as if the boulder has crashed down, nearly striking the transport.|$|E
25|$|Femme à l'Éventail (also {{known as}} L'Éventail vert, Woman with a Fan, and The Lady) is an oil {{painting}} created in 1912 by the French artist and theorist Jean Metzinger (1883–1956).

It was also exhibited at the Musée Rath, Geneva, Exposition de cubistes français et d'un groupe d'artistes indépendants, 3–15 June 1913 (L'éventail vert, no. 22). A 1912 photograph of Femme à l'Éventail <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wall inside the Salon Bourgeois was published in The Sun (New York, N.Y.), 10 November 1912.

25|$|The first {{coat of arms}} of Pavlovsk was {{approved}} by Alexander I in 1801. It features a black double-headed eagle with a white Maltese cross on its chest and the Order of St. Andrew <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> chain under it. On top of the cross there is a red shield with a monogram combining Russian italic letters П and М standing for Emperor Paul and Empress Maria. The eagle has gilded beaks and paws. It holds a ceremonial mace and globus cruciger in the paws; it is crowned with two golden crowns with two more crowns near its heads. The whole composition is placed on a golden shield. There was a proposal of an alternative coat during the Soviet times, {{but it was not}} approved. The updated coat of arms was adopted on 19 September 2007. It has the same composition but with slightly simplified shapes and colors. The modern flag of Pavlovsk was adopted on the same day. It contains the coat image on a yellow rectangle with the length to width ratio of 3:2.|$|E
25|$|Penniman {{must have}} had {{abundant}} opportunity to know Allen’s character. It would seem that she turned against the Toryism of her step-father and her own British ancestry, to sympathize with the settlers in their struggle for freedom and for statehood. But though she doubtless admired Ethan Allen's bravery, {{it is said that}} she was repelled by his rough manners and his tincture of infidelity, and possibly by his family of children, and hesitated for some time before yielding to his wooing. However, after their marriage she had great influence over him though she could not entirely cure him of the convivial habits common to the period. This is illustrated by the story of his watch which she insisted must be found every morning <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> certain nail as evidence that he had returned home the night before in a condition to make connection between the nail and the ring of his watch. In the spring of 1787, the Allens removed to Burlington, Vermont he having purchased the farm later known as the Van Ness farm north of the city, still later converted into Ethan Allen Park. They spent the first few months in the family of a Mr. Collins at “The Bay,” as the little settlement on the Lake was called, where there were then only three or four families. Here, their younger son Hannibal was born.|$|E

The performance at Rome's Olympic Stadium was condemned as an act of hostility toward the Roman Catholic Church by religious leaders.|$|E
