5000|$|Grinding: Grinding or finish-machining {{creates the}} final {{form and the}} surface finish of the cavity in the mould insert. Usually, the finish is carried out by grinding; a {{subsequent}} polishing step is optionally required. <b>Finish</b> <b>grinding</b> can require several changes of the grinding tool and several truing steps of the tool. Finish-machining of the mould is an iterative process: As long as the machined mould shows deviations from the nominal contour in the measurement step after grinding, {{it has to be}} reground. There is no well-defined border between pre-machining and fine grinding. Throughout the grinding process of the cavity, the grain size of the tool, the feed rate and the cutting depth are reduced whereas machining time increases. Convex surfaces are easier to manufacture. The necessary steps of workpiece preparation are the mould alignment and the mould referencing. Grinding tool alignment, grinding tool referencing and grinding tool truing also have to be done. After that polishing can be necessary to remove the anisotropic structure which remains after grinding. It can be performed manually or by a CNC-machine.|$|E

40|$|A strong need {{has existed}} {{to develop a}} hard turning process that can replace {{grinding}} as a finishing process, due to its huge benefits in surface integrity and manufacturing flexibility over <b>finish</b> <b>grinding</b> and superfinishing. Due to the significant advances in machine tool accuracy and cutting tool material properties, chucking, {{which has not been}} improved significantly over the last several decades, has become the weakest link in the whole machine processing system. However, the understanding of chucking accuracy is lacking, nor is any systematic research on the improvement of chucking accuracy is available in literature. In this study, methods which enable evaluating, and improving chucking accuracy of a cylindrical workpiece were developed. This study performed systematic error identification and the analyses of the characteristics of the factors that affect chucking accuracy. Then, the formulations of the relation between the measurable factors and the chucking error were carried out as well as a chucking error map. From these analyses and formulations, methods for compensating the error components on chucking accuracy were developed. The methods were tested using the rings of a taper-roller bearing. From the tests of the methods, it was proven that hard turning alone, without any other finishing process such as grinding, can satisfy the same level of form accuracy that is currently achieved by <b>finish</b> <b>grinding.</b> With the developed chucking methods and strategies, the concentricity error could be reduced significantly or eliminated.

The experimental parameters are electrical current rating, feed rate of electrode and grinding tool, rotational speed of workpiecel, pulsed period, and geometry of finish-tool.
