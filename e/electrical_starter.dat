50|$|Takra's {{stumbling}} block was its price. In December 1951 a Takra with <b>electrical</b> <b>starter,</b> hydraulic three-point linkage, pulley for stationary use, power take-off and headlights was 665 000 marks; for example Fordson Major cost then just 351 500 marks. On the other hand, Takra was also available without the mentioned accessories, which lowered its price.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{electric}} starter motor {{was to come}} to dominate the car market, in 1912 there were several competing types of starter, with the Adams, S.C.A.T. and Wolseley cars having direct air starters, and Sunbeam introducing an air starter motor with similar approach to that used for the Delco and Scott-Crossley <b>electrical</b> <b>starter</b> motors (i.e. engaging with a toothed ring on the flywheel). The Star and Adler cars had spring motors (sometimes referred to as clockwork motors), which used the energy stored in a spring driving through a reduction gear.

50|$|The company flourished during World War II, {{producing}} <b>electrical</b> <b>starters,</b> generators, and Voltage regulators for airplanes, trucks, {{and industrial}} and marine equipment.

By 1950, the company held 56 patents, and with the introduction of the alternator on passenger cars in 1960, company growth and expansion continued. In 1955, Leece-Neville purchased a plant at E. 51st St. and St. Clair to expand production, and in 1959, established a plant in Gainesville, Georgia.|$|R

50|$|From March 1942, {{there was}} less {{pressure}} to placed the CA-12 into production as multiple USAAF units, operating a mixture of P-40 and P-39 fighters, were being deployed in strength to northern Australia; the RAAF had also began to receive new Kittyhawk fighters as well. In June 1943, manufacturing work upon the original order for 105 CA-12s was completed. During production of this batch, several modifications and improvements were incorporated onto the CA-12, these included the strengthening of the spinner back plates and belly tank locating pins, the installation of underwing night flying identification lights, and a revised <b>electrical</b> <b>starter</b> system; many of these modifications would be retrofitted onto early production models at operational bases as well.|$|E

In 1910, having run into financial difficulties, the company was bought by the Siemens-Schuckert-Werken and Ernst Valentin, and moved to Nonnendamm, whence the name Protos Automobilwerk Nonnendamm GmbH. In 1911 the company name was changed to Protos Automobil GmbH. In 1913 Protos became the first car to use an <b>electrical</b> <b>starter.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1993, two {{capacities}} {{replaced the}} 3.0 litre: a 2.8 litre replaced an old single-cam M103 engine and a 3.2 litre replaced a double-cam M104.98X.

50|$|In Japan, the SRX {{was sold}} with a reduced {{displacement}} of 400 cc for tax reasons, or 608 cc. Also, these models featured an oil cooler.

There {{was also an}} SRX 250 on the Japanese market, although this differed somewhat {{in the presence of}} a headlight fairing and electric start. When the international marketing of the SRX stopped, in Japan there was a new production line 3VN; it received an engine derived from the newer XT600E, equipped with an <b>electrical</b> <b>starter.</b> Also, the classic twin-shock configuration was dropped for a mono shock design. This iteration was produced until 1997, when production altogether ceased. The SRX was outlived by its predecessor - the SR400 was still available in 2015.|$|E
50|$|Either an <b>electrical</b> <b>starter</b> or an air-start {{system is}} used to start the engine turning. On large engines, {{pre-lubrication}} and slow turning of an engine, as well as heating, are required to minimise the amount of engine damage during initial start-up and running. Some smaller military diesels can be started with an explosive cartridge, called a Coffman starter, which provides the extra power required to get the machine turning. In the past, Caterpillar and John Deere used a small petrol pony engine in their tractors to start the primary diesel engine. The pony engine heated the diesel to aid in ignition and used a small clutch and transmission to spin up the diesel engine. Even more unusual was an International Harvester design in which the diesel engine had its own carburetor and ignition system, and started on petrol. Once warmed, the operator moved two levers to switch the engine to diesel operation, and work could begin. These engines had very complex cylinder heads, with their own petrol combustion chambers, and were vulnerable to expensive damage if special care was not taken (especially in letting the engine cool before turning it off).|$|E

Description and working principle of the turbine compressor package GTK- 10 - 4 Turbine compressor package GTK- 10 - 4 is designed on the basis of the aeronautical drive NK- 16 ST and used for pipeline gas transmission [1]. The package is a machine mounted on a reinforced concrete base; the equipment parts of the package are arranged in separate transportable units (Fig. 1) and comprise the following major components: 1. Air-intake chamber 1 used for atmospheric air purification flowing into the axial flow compressor; starter motor 2 (turbo expander, air start unit or <b>electrical</b> <b>starter)</b> used for initial spinning of an axial flow compressor (AC) and a high pressure turbine at the start of the turbine compressor package. 2.

50|$|A {{soft starter}} {{continuously}} controls the three-phase motor’s voltage supply during the start-up phase. This way, the motor is {{adjusted to the}} machine’s load behavior. Mechanical operating equipment is accelerated smoothly. This lengthens service life, improves operating behavior, and smooths work flows. <b>Electrical</b> soft <b>starters</b> can use solid state devices to control the current flow and therefore the voltage applied to the motor. They can be connected in series with the line voltage applied to the motor, or can be connected inside the delta (Δ) loop of a delta-connected motor, controlling the voltage applied to each winding. Solid state soft starters can control one or more phases of the voltage applied to the induction motor with the best results achieved by three-phase control. Typically, the voltage is controlled by reverse-parallel-connected silicon-controlled rectifiers (thyristors), but in some circumstances with three-phase control, the control elements can be a reverse-parallel-connected SCR and diode.|$|R

2500|$|A 2013 {{survey of}} 4,424 [...] {{readers of the}} US Consumer Reports {{magazine}} collected reliability data on 4,680 motorcycles purchased new from 2009 to 2012. The most common problem areas were accessories, brakes, <b>electrical</b> (including <b>starters,</b> charging, ignition), and fuel systems, {{and the types of}} motorcycles with the greatest problems were touring, off-road/dual sport, sport-touring, and cruisers. There were not enough sport bikes in the survey for a statistically significant conclusion, though the data hinted at reliability as good as cruisers. These results may be partially explained by accessories including such equipment as fairings, luggage, and auxiliary lighting, which are frequently added to touring, adventure touring/dual sport and sport touring bikes. Trouble with fuel systems is often the result of improper winter storage, and brake problems may also be due to poor maintenance. Of the five brands with enough data to draw conclusions, Honda, Kawasaki and Yamaha were statistically tied, with 11 to 14% of those bikes in the survey experiencing major repairs. Harley-Davidsons had a rate of 24%, while BMWs did worst, with 30% of those needing major repairs. There were not enough Triumph and Suzuki motorcycles surveyed for a statistically sound conclusion, though it appeared Suzukis were as reliable as the other three Japanese brands while Triumphs were comparable to Harley-Davidson and BMW. Three fourths of the repairs in the survey cost less than US$200 and two thirds of the motorcycles were repaired in less than two days. In spite of their relatively worse reliability in this survey, Harley-Davidson and BMW owners showed the greatest owner satisfaction, and three fourths of them said they would buy the same bike again, followed by 72% of Honda owners and 60 to 63% of Kawasaki and Yamaha owners.|$|R
