5|$|After Monica Dawson (Dana Davis) is {{captured}} by a street gang, Micah Sanders (Noah Gray-Cabey) {{turns to his}} mother Niki (Ali Larter) for help. Despite the fact that Niki no longer has her powers due to the virus, she agrees to help. They follow a GPS signal emitted by Monica's cell phone and find her in an abandoned warehouse. She is tied up and the warehouse <b>is</b> <b>burning</b> around her. Using what remains of her superhuman strength, Niki manages to help Monica escape, but her strength eventually fails and she ends up trapped inside the building as it explodes.|$|E
5|$|Finn {{manages to}} steal the crown, hoping to sell it instead of Bartram. In town, however, the Destiny Gang steal the crown as well as Bartram. Finn, furious, riles up the town, who begin to riot, as they are sick of being abused by the Destiny Gang. Finn goes to the Destiny Gang's mansion to confront their leader, Big Destiny. Once there, Big Destiny returns the crown, noting {{that it is the}} last {{possession}} that he will ever own. Finn looks out the window and sees that the gang <b>is</b> <b>burning</b> the city. Finn races to his home, taking Marceline with him. When he arrives at his house, the gang has already set it on fire with his parents and infant sibling trapped upstairs. Finn asks Marceline if the crown is magic and she tells him it is very dangerous magic. He then puts the crown on his head, and the power begins to flow through him.|$|E
5|$|Upstairs, Stewie takes drastic {{measures}} to protect his plans, programming the machine {{to go back in}} time before he drew them up. In the bar, Peter and Lois have a heart-to-heart conversation, and they do not immediately notice that the bar <b>is</b> <b>burning.</b> When they try to escape, the stairs become blocked and they are trapped. Stewie reverses time just as Peter is having an epiphany about how poorly he treats Lois, and seconds before the basement bar goes up in flames. They all travel back in time, to when Lois asked Peter to take Chris to the game. While he is getting ready, Peter trips on Stewie's time machine, destroying it and injuring his leg, thus preventing him from taking Chris to his soccer match, while Stewie is left to suffer with more teething pain.|$|E

25|$|Disused {{coal mines}} {{can also cause}} issues. Subsidence can occur above tunnels, causing damage to {{infrastructure}} or cropland. Coal mining can also cause long lasting fires, {{and it has been}} estimated that thousands of coal seam fires <b>are</b> <b>burning</b> at any given time. For example, there is a coal seam fire in Germany that has <b>been</b> <b>burning</b> since 1668, and <b>is</b> still <b>burning</b> in the 21st century.|$|R

25|$|In 2005, author Jonathan Mahler {{published}} Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx <b>is</b> <b>Burning,</b> {{a book on}} New York in 1977, and credited Cosell with {{saying the}} title quote during the aerial coverage of the fire.

25|$|Since its inception, The Jim Rome Show {{has always}} been offered on {{terrestrial}} radio, {{and has not been}} offered on satellite radio. The show is, however, offered on streaming and podcast through the official web site. On May 6, 2003, Rome made a return to TV with Rome <b>Is</b> <b>Burning</b> (later Jim Rome <b>Is</b> <b>Burning)</b> on ESPN, and occasionally hinted about switching the radio program to satellite, or abandoning the radio program altogether, in favor of television full-time.|$|E
25|$|Once large {{kindling}} <b>is</b> <b>burning,</b> all kindling {{should be}} put on the fire, save for one piece at least a foot long. This piece is useful later to push pieces of fuel wood where needed. Once all of the kindling <b>is</b> <b>burning,</b> the fuel wood should be placed on top of it (unless, as in the rakovalkea fire-build, it is already there). For best results, two or more pieces of fuel wood should be leaned against each other, as in the tipi fire-build.|$|E

25|$|A {{variation}} on the log cabin starts with two pieces of fuel wood {{with a pile of}} tinder between them, and small kindling laid over the tops of the logs, above the tinder. The tinder is lit, and the kindling is allowed to catch fire. When it <b>is</b> <b>burning</b> briskly, it is broken and pushed down into the consumed tinder, and the larger kindling is placed {{over the top of the}} logs. When that <b>is</b> <b>burning</b> well, it is also pushed down. Eventually, a pile of kindling burns between two pieces of fuel wood, and soon the logs catch fire from it.|$|E
25|$|A cross-fire {{is built}} by {{positioning}} {{two pieces of}} wood with the tinder in between. Once the fire <b>is</b> <b>burning</b> well, additional pieces of wood are placed on top in layers that alternate directions. This type of fire creates coals suitable for cooking.|$|E

25|$|Wood {{combustion}} products can include toxic and carcinogenic substances.
