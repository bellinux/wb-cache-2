5|$|Use of the Fibre-fed <b>Echelle</b> Spectrograph (FIES) at the Nordic Optical Telescope on the Canary Islands on June 4, 2009 {{provided}} {{data that}} was used to determine the star's stellar classification. The W.M. Keck Observatory's High Resolution <b>Echelle</b> Spectrometer (HIRES), which was used on June 3–6, 2009, and July 2–4, 2009, determined radial velocity measurements for the star, which helped to further define stellar parameters.|$|E
5|$|WASP-13 was {{observed}} between February 11 and 15 in 2008 by the SOPHIE <b>échelle</b> spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in France, determining the radial {{velocity of the}} transiting body. Use of the FIES <b>echelle</b> spectrograph at the Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands gained other spectral measurements that yielded {{the characteristics of the}} star. Analysis of the SOPHIE and FIES data were used to constrain some of the orbiting body's characteristics. The discovery of the orbiting body's mass using radial velocity measurements led to its confirmation as the planet WASP-13b.|$|E
5|$|CORALIE and the High Resolution <b>Echelle</b> Spectrometer (HIRES) {{revealed}} {{the spectrum of}} WASP-15, which was used to derive the star's characteristics. The science team studying WASP-15 found that, after running best-fit models, WASP-15's radial velocity and transit shifts were most likely due {{to the existence of}} a planet.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} {{were conducted by}} a team of British, Spanish, French, Swiss and American astronomers using the photometer on the James Gregory Telescope in Scotland; using visual comparisons to the nearby bright star HD 80408, the star's light curve was better defined. In combination with measurements of WASP-13's spectrum measured using the SOPHIE <b>échelle</b> spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in France, the star's radial velocity was also discovered. The Fibre-Fed <b>Echelle</b> Spectrograph on the Nordic Optical Telescope gathered additional measurements of WASP-13's spectrum, allowing astronomers to determine WASP-13's characteristics. Use of SOPHIE's data led to the discovery of the planet WASP-13b in 2008; the planet was reported in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{star was}} studied through the Magellan Inamori Kyocera <b>Echelle</b> spectrograph's (MIKE) {{ability to use}} Doppler {{spectroscopy}} to measure radial velocity. Twenty-four measurements were recorded for HD 205739. The measurements were analyzed for accuracy. They were then used to derive the planet's characteristics, {{which led to the}} planet's confirmation.|$|E
5|$|Use of the Magellan Clay telescope's Magellan Inamori Kyocera <b>Echelle</b> {{spectrograph}} (MIKE) helped collect sixteen {{radial velocity}} measurements for HD 154672; {{a team of}} American astronomers and one from the Vatican City used these measurements to confirm the existence of planet HD 154672 b and to determine its mass.|$|E
5|$|Between September 2008 and December 2010, twenty-two spectra were {{collected}} using the High Resolution <b>Echelle</b> Spectrometer (HIRES) instrument at Hawaii's W.M. Keck Observatory. This data {{was used to}} derive HAT-P-33's radial velocity. A far greater number of spectra were gathered for HAT-P-33 than the number usually gathered for planetary candidates {{to compensate for the}} data's jitter effect. It was concluded that the jitter in the data was caused by stellar activity and not the presence of other planets.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent radial {{velocity}} measurements by the High Resolution <b>Echelle</b> Spectrometer on the telescopes of W.M. Keck Observatory confirmed the planetary {{nature of the}} transit event and established a mass estimate for the planet. The planet's existence was announced on January 4, 2010 along with four other planets detected by Kepler: Kepler-5b, 6b, 7b and 8b at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Data on Kepler-40 was {{analyzed}} {{by a team}} of French and Swiss astronomers, who first tested for false positives. When all obvious false positives were cleared, the science team used the SOPHIE <b>échelle</b> spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in southern France to gather radial velocity measurements on the star. Collected data was then checked to see if it corresponded with that of a closely orbiting binary star or that of a planet; it was found to be that of a planet, leading to the confirmation of Kepler-40b.|$|E
5|$|The {{allometric}} exponent for sail {{height is}} similar in magnitude to the scaling of interspecific antler length to shoulder height in cervids. Furthermore, as Bakker (1970) observed {{in the context of}} Dimetrodon, many lizard species raise a dorsal ridge of skin during threat and courtship displays, and positively allometric, sexually dimorphic frills and dewlaps are present in extant lizards (<b>Echelle</b> et al. 1978; Christian et al. 1995). There is also evidence of sexual dimorphism both in the robustness of the skeleton and in the relative height of the spines of D. limbatus (Romer and Price 1940).|$|E
5|$|A team {{composed}} of astronomers from France and Switzerland used the SOPHIE <b>échelle</b> spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in southern France to examine Kepler-40. SOPHIE uses radial velocity measurements to examine stars for exoplanets. After background light was removed and alternative causes for radial velocity variations were disproved (for example, that Kepler-40 {{was actually a}} close binary star), the team used SOPHIE to analyze {{the properties of the}} actual star. The astronomers observing the star found that it is nearing the main sequence turn-off (the star fuses the last of its hydrogen and becomes a red giant). The establishment of stellar parameters helped the astronomers extrapolate the exoplanet's parameters and prove the existence of Kepler-40b. The discovered planet was the sixth transiting planet to have been discovered in orbit around stars with a radius of more than 1.8 times that of the Sun, after planets including Kepler-5 and Kepler-7.|$|E
5|$|As a start, the {{spectrum}} of HAT-P-33 was composed using the digital speedometer at the 1.5-meter Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Arizona. The collected data found that the star was a single dwarf star exhibiting a slight rotation. Several of its parameters, including its effective temperature and surface gravity, were found. Additionally, the SOPHIE <b>échelle</b> spectrograph at a 1.93-meter telescope at France's Haute-Provence Observatory was used to observe the star. The resulting data invited the possibility that radial velocity measurements, which can exhibit anomalies that often indicate {{the presence of a}} planet, may have been because of background distortion (and not a planet). This possibility significantly complicated the ability of scientists to verify this planet. After the observations, follow-ups were postponed for several years.|$|E
5|$|Flagged {{initially}} as {{a transit}} event by the satellite, Kepler-9d {{was given the}} designation KOI 377.03. It was recognized as a potential planet after a study into the system confirmed Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c, but follow-up studies had to be completed to verify that it was indeed a planet, and that the apparent transit event was not due to a background eclipsing binary star in the aperture of Kepler's photometer. Kepler's team exhaustively disproved that the small transit event could have been anything but a planet, and their results {{were published in the}} Astrophysical Journal on January 1, 2011. Follow-up observations were conducted by the High Resolution <b>Echelle</b> Spectrometer at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, as well as the WIYN Observatory in Arizona and the Palomar Observatory in California.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-40b, {{formerly}} known as KOI-428b, is a hot Jupiter discovered in orbit around the star Kepler-40, which {{is about to become}} a red giant. The planet was first noted as a transit event by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. The Kepler team made data collected by its satellite publicly available, including data on Kepler-40; French and Swiss astronomers used the equivalent to one night of measurements on the SOPHIE <b>échelle</b> spectrograph to collect all the data needed to show that a planet was producing the periodic dimming of Kepler-40. The planet, Kepler-40b, is twice the mass of Jupiter and slightly larger than it in size, making it as dense as Neptune. The planet is also nearly thirteen times hotter than Jupiter and orbits five times closer to its star than Mercury is from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Radial {{velocity}} observations {{had been}} taken by the N2K program using the Magellan Telescopes' Magellan Inamori Kyocera <b>Echelle</b> spectrograph (MIKE) at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile since 2004. Based on these observations, the stars HD 154672 and HD 205739 were among those flagged as potential planetary host stars. The two stars were identified originally as having short-orbit hot Jupiter planets, but 3.5 years of additional observations revealed that the planetary candidates' orbits were far longer than initially anticipated. HD 154672 b's discovery {{was reported in the}} Astronomical Journal by the American Astronomical Society, appearing in the journal on October 7, 2008 alongside the planet HD 205739 b. The two planets were the first to be discovered by the N2K program that worked out of the Magellan telescopes.|$|E
5|$|The Kepler-8b {{planet is}} named {{because it was}} the first planet {{discovered}} in the orbit of Kepler-8. The star itself (and by extension, its planet) was named after the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA-run satellite that searches for terrestrial planets between constellations Cygnus and Lyra that transit, or cross in front of, their host stars with respect to Earth. This crossing slightly dims the star at a regular interval, which is used to determine if the cause of the fluctuation in brightness is indeed due to a planetary transit. The planet was first noted as a potential transit event by the Kepler telescope, and was originally designated as KOI 10.01. Follow-up observations by the High Resolution <b>Echelle</b> Spectrometer at Hawaii's W.M. Keck Observatory yielded additional information about the planet, including its mass and radius. Kepler-8b was the fifth planet discovered by the Kepler telescope. The first three planets in Kepler's field of view had already been confirmed, and were used to test Kepler's accuracy.|$|E
500|$|The Fibre-fed <b>Échelle</b> Spectrograph (FIES) on the Canary Islands' Nordic Optical Telescope was {{operated}} in October 2009, using Doppler spectroscopy {{to gather information}} that would accompany the gathered photometric observations. The High Resolution <b>Échelle</b> Spectrometer (HIRES) at the W.M. Keck Observatory was also utilized. Use of the WIYN Observatory for speckle imaging found that the host star of KOI-98 was actually a close-knit binary star, which complicated the analysis. A November 2009 operation of the ARIES instrument on the MMT Observatory and the July 2010 use of the PHARO near-infrared camera on the Palomar Observatory's [...] 200inch Hale telescope used adaptive optics to confirm WIYN's findings. Although suspected as a planet early on, KOI-98 was not included when Kepler-4b, Kepler-5b, Kepler-6b, Kepler-7b, and Kepler-8b were published, as further investigation was still required.|$|E
500|$|In the United States, {{the first}} {{operational}} regional model, the limited-area fine-mesh (LFM) model, {{was introduced in}} 1971. [...] Its development was halted, or frozen, in 1986. [...] The NGM debuted in 1987 and was also used to create model output statistics for the United States. [...] Its development was frozen in 1991. [...] The ETA model was implemented for the United States in 1993 and in turn was upgraded to the NAM in 2006. The U.S. also offers the Rapid Refresh (which replaced the RUC in 2012) for short-range and high-resolution applications; both the Rapid Refresh and NAM are built on the same framework, the WRF. Metéo France has been running their Action de Recherche Petite <b>Échelle</b> Grande <b>Échelle</b> (ALADIN) mesoscale model for France, based upon the ECMWF global model, since 1995. [...] In July 1996, the Bureau of Meteorology implemented the Limited Area Prediction System (LAPS). The Canadian Regional Finite-Elements model (RFE) went into operational use on April 22, 1986. [...] It {{was followed by the}} Canadian Global Environmental Multiscale Model (GEM) mesoscale model on February 24, 1997.|$|E
500|$|The Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting (HWRF) {{model is}} a {{specialized}} version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and is used to forecast the track and intensity of tropical cyclones.

It became operational in 2007. [...] Despite improvements in track forecasting, predictions of the intensity of a tropical cyclone based on numerical weather prediction continue to be a challenge, since statiscal methods continue to show higher skill over dynamical guidance. Other than the specialized guidance, global guidance such as the GFS, Unified Model (UKMET), NOGAPS, Japanese Global Spectral Model (GSM), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model, France's Action de Recherche Petite <b>Echelle</b> Grande <b>Echelle</b> (ARPEGE) and Aire Limit´ee Adaptation Dynamique Initialisation (ALADIN) models, India's National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMWRF) model, Korea's Global Data Assimilation and Prediction System (GDAPS) and Regional Data Assimilation and Prediction System (RDAPS) models, Hong Kong/China's Operational Regional Spectral Model (ORSM) model, and Canadian Global Environmental Multiscale Model (GEM) model are used for track and intensity purposes.|$|E
2500|$|Gliese 581g was {{claimed to}} be {{detected}} by astronomers of the Lick–Carnegie Exoplanet Survey. The authors stated that data sets from both High Resolution <b>Echelle</b> Spectrometer (HIRES) and HARPS were needed to sense the planet; however, the ESO/HARPS survey team could not confirm its existence. The planet remained unconfirmed as consensus for its existence could not be reached. Additional reanalysis only found evidence for four planets, but the discoverer, Steven S. Vogt, {{did not agree with}} those conclusions; another study by Guillem Anglada-Escudé later supported the planet's existence. In 2012, a reanalysis by Vogt supported its existence. A new study in 2014 concluded that it was a false positive; however, in 2015, a reanalysis of the data suggested that it could still exist. The planet is thought to be tidally locked to its star. If the planet has a dense atmosphere, it may be able to circulate heat. The actual habitability of the planet depends on the composition of its surface and the atmosphere. It is thought to have temperatures around −37 to −11°C (−35 to 10°F). By comparison, Earth has an average surface temperature of 15°C (59°F)—while Mars has an average surface temperatures of about −63°C (−81°F). The planet has, according to Vogt, a [...] "100%" [...] chance of supporting life, but this is disputed. The supposed detection of Gliese 581g foreshadows what Vogt calls [...] "a second Age of Discovery".|$|E
2500|$|The grating {{equation}} {{shows that}} the angles of the diffracted orders only depend on the grooves' period, and not on their shape. By controlling the cross-sectional profile of the grooves, {{it is possible to}} concentrate most of the diffracted energy in a particular order for a given wavelength. A triangular profile is commonly used. This technique is called blazing. The incident angle and wavelength for which the diffraction is most efficient are often called blazing angle and blazing wavelength. [...] The efficiency of a grating may also depend on the polarization of the incident light. Gratings are usually designated by their groove density, the number of grooves per unit length, usually expressed in grooves per millimeter (g/mm), also equal to the inverse of the groove period. The groove period must be on the order of the wavelength of interest; the spectral range covered by a grating is dependent on groove spacing and is the same for ruled and holographic gratings with the same grating constant. The maximum wavelength that a grating can diffract is equal to twice the grating period, in which case the incident and diffracted light will be at ninety degrees to the grating normal. To obtain frequency dispersion over a wider frequency one must use a prism. In the optical regime, in which the use of gratings is most common, this corresponds to wavelengths between 100 nm [...] and 10 µm. In that case, the groove density can vary from a few tens of grooves per millimeter, as in <b>echelle</b> gratings, to a few thousands of grooves per millimeter.|$|E
