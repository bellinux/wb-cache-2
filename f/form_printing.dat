50|$|After the {{political}} transition {{most of the}} state monopolies ceased to exist and the competition started for the production of those products which were previously produced exclusively by state monopolies. As the state protection ended, there was no other choice but to reconsider the situation of the Company. In view of these facts, the State Printing House was privatised in 1993. For the development of the company, a larger work area, and more modern and cultured working conditions were necessary so the Company moved to Kőbánya, another district of the capital, from its former building near the Buda Castle. The new printing house in Halom Street was opened officially on 4 October 1994. Meanwhile, the State Printing House took over the equipment and most of the employees of SZÜV Continuous <b>Form</b> <b>Printing</b> House. A brand new division was included in the portfolio of State Printing House from 1997: plastic card production and personalization. The investment started at the beginning of 1998 and a new modern plant was established in Fátyolka Street which developed further in 2000 and became able to produce chip cards. State Printing House established its Document Security Laboratory in 1999 which functions as a centre of R&D activities. State Printing House started international expansion in 2005 when it founded joint ventures with its local partners in Romania and Bulgaria and subsidiaries in Slovakia and Russia.|$|E

Three different types of forms and applications for their detection are created with the reference of these principles. This application provides to create a new type of form and to print out a form. The application itself is implemented in C++ with the use of OpenCV library.

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the theory}} of {{computer}} simulation and the theory of traffic flow, the urban intersection traffic microscopic simulation model is established. Besides, the simulation system is realized {{on the basis of}} this model and the object-oriented design. This system is implemented in the integrated development environment Eclipse 3. 2 for Java, and basically has the functions of the animation simulation of traffic flow, real-time rendering of the traffic volume and delay time curves, dynamic display of the numbers of vehicles in the different lanes, the simulation of traffic control, data statistics and report <b>form</b> <b>printing.</b> The correctness of the model algorithm software and the validity of the function of this simulation software have been initially confirmed through the simulation examples. Not only that, we can analyze the real-time traffic conditions via the simulation outputs and before putting the new traffic management scheme into effect and changing the road infrastructure, this simulation system can also be used to analyze and evaluate the new scheme. Besides, higher efficiency can be gained, with more waste avoided...|$|E

The quality of continuous form products is to be considered consumers in making a purchase at Jadi Jaya Group. The strategy used by Jadi Jaya Group to maintain brand image is new innovations with printed paper-based Security Printing design that makes the company different from competitors and increase brand trust. This study used non-probability sampling is used for judgmental sampling. Data were collected from 197 respondents selected using criteria that should have made a purchase of continuous form at least twice. The method analysis used in this research was Maximum Likelihood test using the program of AMOS version 21. 0. The {{results show that the}} product quality and brand image has positive influence on brand trust. But, brand trust did not positive influence on purchasing decisions.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in mass printing is repeatability and stability of the ink transfer from the printing plate onto the printing substrate. The pad printing is characterised by indirect ink transfer from a gravure printing plate. Beside area of the printing elements, on the pad printing plate one should take into account their depth as it is a factor which directly influences the printing ink quantity, i. e. overall quality of the printed product. The photopolymer pad printing plate production includes two exposures with UV irradiation, first to make difference between printing and nonprinting areas and second to form partitions (walls) in the printing elements. The duration of the second exposure directly influences the final depth of the printing elements. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine influence of the second exposure on the depth of the printing elements, consequently on the reproduction of the pad printing plate elements. For this purpose four pad printing plate samples with various coverage tone value fields will be made by variation of the second exposure duration. Results have shown that second exposure duration significantly influences the printing elements size and therefore should be defined precisely in order to <b>form</b> <b>printing</b> elements of desired depth...|$|E

40|$|According to Food and Agriculture Organization {{newsprint}} {{is defined}} as: Uncoated paper, unsized (or only slightly sized), containing at least 60 percent of mechanical wood pulp. The consumption of newsprint in Sweden {{was just over}} 798 000 tonnes in 2009, which represents approximately 90 kg per person. Although there are studies that predict a drastic reduction in newsprint consumption in the Western world, {{there seems to be}} a clear difference between forecasts for the future given by statistical analysis of newsprint consumption and forecasts given by experts in the industry. The former predict a continuing increase while the experts see a coming decrease in consumption. In this report, both demand and business strategies of newsprint in Sweden are studied. The study also presents a forecast of the future which is based on historical data and qualitative interviews. According to the regression analysis done in this research the consumption will increase with an increase in GDP. However, the qualitative interviews are pointing to another direction. Experts in the newsprint industry believe the increase in consumption of newsprint in Sweden will slow down over time and it might even decrease in total. This will probably largely depend on the development of information and communications technology such as Internet, e-readers and mobile phones. Business strategies for meeting the structural difference, that may appear in the future, varies from different parts of the industry.
