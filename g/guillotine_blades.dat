50|$|When Kaplan {{left the}} project to embark on other artist {{cooperative}} buildings, Maciunas was left with little support against the law. Maciunas continued the co-op despite contravening planning laws, buying a series of loft buildings to sell to artists as working and living spaces. Although it was illegal to sell the units publicly without first filing a full-disclosure prospectus with the New York State Attorney General, Maciunas ignored the legal requirements, beginning a series of increasingly bizarre run-ins with the Attorney General of New York. Maciunas began wearing disguises and going out only at night. Strategies included sending postcards {{from around the world}} via associates and friends to persuade the authorities that he was abroad, and placing razor-sharp <b>guillotine</b> <b>blades</b> onto his front door to avoid unwanted visitors. Though, like other Fluxus projects, Maciunas managed his duties without personal profit, financial disputes between the cooperatives led to problems. An argument with an electrician over unpaid bills resulted in a severe beating, allegedly by 'Mafia thugs', November 8, 1975, which left him with 4 broken ribs, a deflated lung, 36 stitches in his head and blind in one eye. He left New York shortly after, to attempt to start a Fluxus-oriented arts centre in a dilapidated mansion and stud farm in New Marlborough, Massachusetts.|$|E
50|$|A two-page {{comic strip}} La Rue perdue (The Lost Street) was {{published}} in 1978, featuring Gil Jourdan, a detective created by Maurice Tillieux. Set in 1953, it has Jourdan {{trying to find out}} why a fake <b>guillotine</b> <b>blade</b> is hanging outside the door of a black African friend. The person responsible {{turns out to be a}} man obsessed with Madame du Barry and taking his anger at her death out on Jourdan's friend, who looks like Zamor. The action is set in Rue Maître Albert, where Zamor lived before his death.|$|R
50|$|During the executions, the executioners mostly {{followed}} this procedure: One held {{the hands of}} the condemned to prevent him from moving when the <b>guillotine</b> <b>blade</b> descended. The second stood {{at the feet of the}} prisoner and untied his hands after the beheading. The two additional assistants pulled the body to a trunk to the right of the place of execution, took the head out of the basket and laid it next to the body. After that, Weiss wrote down in the execution book the names of his victims. As can be gathered from the notes, an execution took three minutes. The victims were cremated in Prague's Strašnice Crematorium.|$|R
50|$|Finally {{comes the}} day {{in which he is}} to be executed, his demand for {{reconsideration}} having been refused. He is brought to a Catholic priest, to which he asks pardon for all his past sins. He sees the man that will bring an end to his life, and declares he does not consider him guilty of anything and pardons him completely. Then, a coach escorts him to the marketplace of Troyes, where a guillotine has been prepared. Before getting executed, he gives a coin, his only possession, to the priest that has come with him, and asks him to give it to the poor. Then, the <b>guillotine's</b> <b>blade</b> falls upon his neck, and he dies.|$|R
50|$|Kühne {{was eager}} to {{demonstrate}} the technique in a human subject, and in 1880, got the opportunity. On 16 November, Erhard Gustav Reif was executed by guillotine {{for the murder of}} his children in the nearby town of Bruchsal. Reif's eyes were extracted and delivered to Kühne's laboratory at the University of Heidelberg, where he set about dissecting them in a darkened room with filtered windows. After ten minutes, Kühne showed his colleagues an image on the left retina, however his sketch of the image did not appear to match any object visible to the subject {{at the time of his}} death—although the outline of the image resembled a <b>guillotine</b> <b>blade,</b> Reif was blindfolded at the time of his beheading.|$|R
5000|$|In 1962, Dalí {{said this}} {{painting}} was intended [...] "to express {{for the first}} time in images Freud's discovery of the typical dream with a lengthy narrative, the consequence of the instantaneousness of a chance event which causes the sleeper to wake up. Thus, as a bar might fall on the neck of a sleeping person, causing them to wake up and for a long dream to end with the <b>guillotine</b> <b>blade</b> falling on them, the noise of the bee here provokes the sensation of the sting which will awaken Gala." [...] The guillotine anecdote refers to a dream reported by Alfred Maury in Le sommeil et les rêves ("Sleep and Dreams") and related by Freud in The Interpretation of Dreams.|$|R
5000|$|Veronica is a bio-weapon assassin {{crafted by}} Dr. Madaraki {{for his own}} protection. As such, she is notably violent, though bound to a humane battle {{etiquette}} and creed: [...] "to murder while causing as little suffering as possible" [...] and [...] "rather a painless death than a painful life." [...] In addition to her naturally high combat ability, she is trained in the handling of explosives and the setting of traps in the field. Wielding a huge <b>guillotine</b> <b>blade</b> in her right arm and a sharp sword in her left, she also appears to have needles {{on the ends of}} her fingertips which allow her to inject viruses into her victims. She has an X-shaped stitching across her face and a fairly benign, young appearance.|$|R
50|$|At 1946, {{during the}} Nuremberg Trials, the Czechoslovak {{physician}} Doctor Heřman is abducted by a mysterious organization. To his horror, Heřman discovers {{that he is}} to treat Adolf Hitler, whose suicide in 1945 was faked. Hitler now lives in an isolated sanatorium in Germany, surrounded by his ostensibly loyal followers, a group of former high-ranking Nazis. But those men blame him for Germany's defeat and destruction, and have decided that a single death is not satisfactory punishment for Hitler. Rather, he is made {{to believe that the}} Second World War is still being fought. The German officers stage 'Allied raids' in which Hitler is captured, faces trial and a death sentence, put under the <b>guillotine's</b> <b>blade</b> and then is rescued by his supporters at the last moment - only to face it all again, over and over. The experience drives Hitler into an unberable mental agony; The doctor decides {{to put an end to}} his misery and kills him.|$|R
5000|$|On December 28, {{two days}} after his return to Paris, Gauguin went to the dawn {{execution}} of the criminal Prado. Van Gogh and Gauguin had talked about Prado's high profile trial. Prado had murdered a prostitute and Gauguin thought his trial unjust, a view he shared with Friedrich Nietzsche who refers to him in his last [...] "madness letter". Both Prado and the equally infamous murderer Pranzini were at one time patrons at the Parisian café Le Tambourin where Van Gogh had exhibited Japanese prints. The execution left a deep mark on the artist and soured the artist's view of humanity. According to Gauguin's account the execution was botched; the first strike of the <b>guillotine's</b> <b>blade</b> missed Prado's neck and carved off {{a portion of his}} face. The man rose from the head-board in agony and shock and had to be forced back into position before the second attempt removed his head. However contemporary news reports of the execution make no mention of this.|$|R
5000|$|Kara {{discovers that}} Cat hired a new assistant, Siobhan Smythe, who Cat {{introduces}} as her [...] "number one." [...] Cat also assigns James and Lucy to investigate Maxwell's disappearance. James reminds Kara that Maxwell can't be held because of due process. An escaped Fort Rozz prisoner is cornered by the DEO, but they discover the alien is already captured by an armored attacker. This armored attacker, Master Jailer, kills the alien via <b>guillotine</b> <b>blade.</b> Alex, Hank and Kara later discover, {{with help from}} Detective Draper, that missing persons cases match with missing Fort Rozz prisoners and bodies have {{turned up in the}} river. Siobhan calls out Kara over slacking on the job after Kara leaves for the DEO. Lucy shows pictures to James, believing Maxwell is being held by a secret government organization that tracks aliens. James accidentally reveals the truth about the DEO, causing Lucy to be jealous of his relationship with Supergirl. At the DEO, they learn that Master Jailer uses the prisoners' identification numbers to track them down. Kara arrives to protect his next target, a professor, but Jailer is victorious.|$|R
50|$|Poulenc set his {{libretto}} {{largely in}} recitative. His own religious feelings are particularly {{evident in the}} a cappella setting of Ave Maria in Act II, Scene II, and the Ave verum corpus in Act II, Scene IV. During the final tableau of the opera, which {{takes place in the}} Place de la Nation, the distinct sound of the <b>guillotine's</b> descending <b>blade</b> is heard repeatedly over the orchestra and the singing of the nuns, who are taken one by one, until only Soeur Constance and Blanche de la Force remain.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: As {{shown in}} this British cartoon by Isaac Cruikshank, the {{guillotine}} became a disparaging symbol of violent excess during the Reign of Terror. The tricolor ribbon on top is inscribed [...] "No God! No Religion! No King! No Constitution!" [...] Below the ribbon, and its Phrygian cap with tricolor cockade, are two bloody axes, attached to a <b>guillotine,</b> whose <b>blade</b> is suspended above a world aflame. An emaciated man and drunken woman dressed in ragged clothes serve as heraldic [...] "supporters", gleefully dancing on discarded royal and clerical regalia.|$|R
25|$|Despite the {{prevalence}} of elective onychectomy in North America, no standard practices exist regarding the surgical techniques or surgical tools used, the administration of post-operative analgesics or other follow-up care, or the optimal age or other attributes of cats undergoing the procedure. There are three surgical methods: scalpel <b>blade,</b> <b>guillotine</b> trimmers, and laser.|$|R
5000|$|Those who {{attended}} the orgiastic balls reportedly wore mourning clothes or elaborate costumes with crepe armbands signifying mourning. Some accounts have {{both men and women}} wearing plain but scanty dress {{in the wake of the}} impoverishment of the Revolution, at least until the return of their fortunes at which time ball dress became highly elaborate. Others describe women, in the fashion of Merveilleuses, dressing scandalously in Greco-Roman attire, with their feet bare, in sandals, or adorned only by ribbons, a possible allusion to the fact that women often went barefoot to the guillotine. The style of dress at such a ball was known by some as the [...] "costume à la victime." [...] Women, and by some accounts men too, wore a red ribbon or string around their necks at the point of a <b>guillotine</b> <b>blade's</b> impact. Both men and women attending the balls were said to have worn or cut their hair in a fashion that bared their necks in a manner reflecting the haircut given the victim by the executioner, women often using a comb known as a cadenette to achieve this fashion. According to some, this was the origin of the feminine hairstyle known as the [...] "coiffure à la victime" [...] or more popularly the [...] "coiffure à la Titus", or (in England) [...] "a la guillotine". Some sources state that a woman sporting this hairstyle sometimes wore a red shawl or throat ribbon even when not attending a bal des victimes.|$|R
50|$|Napoleon ends up {{catching}} Bugs {{by holding}} him at gunpoint and orders {{him into a}} guillotine. Bugs runs off with Napoleon in pursuit, running down the guillotine platform and then back up and through the guillotine which is still raised. Napoleon follows Bugs but as he runs through the <b>guillotine</b> the <b>blade</b> falls and slices {{the back of his}} uniform along with the hair {{from the back of his}} head. Napoleon demands an explanation from the hooded executioner, who is revealed to be Bugs himself. Bugs then tries to elude Napoleon by hiding in a cannon, but is found when Mugsy is ordered to sound the alarm and fires the cannon.|$|R
5000|$|Pete {{is furious}} that the Beagle Boys failed in their task and {{realizes that the}} three protagonists are more of a threat than he {{originally}} anticipated. He then plans {{to get rid of}} them one by one. While on night duty, Goofy is lured away from the palace by Clarabelle and subdued. The Beagle Boys attack Donald, scaring him into hiding, before Pete traps him and puts Donald to the guillotine. Donald escapes his execution at the last second, causing Pete to lose his peg leg as he dove under the <b>guillotine's</b> <b>blade</b> to stop him. Donald returns to the castle and tells the whole story to Mickey (who doesn't understand him at first) before running off in fear, leaving Mickey by himself. Mickey is then captured by Pete, who chains him up in a dungeon in Mont Saint-Michel that will flood when the tide comes in. Goofy is meanwhile chained by Clarabelle and is about to be thrown off a bridge over a river to drown, but Goofy falls in love with Clarabelle and wins her heart with his [...] "numbskull charm". As Clarabelle reveals Pete's true intentions, the bridge crumbles and Goofy and Clarabelle fall to the river below. Donald, who is rowing across the river to escape France, breaks their fall. Goofy fails to convince Donald to help him save Mickey, but thanks to an insulting song from Troubadour, the duo save Mickey and the trio eventually escape and reconcile with each other and set off to rescue Daisy and Princess Minnie.|$|R
5000|$|Sophie, who {{had been}} told that {{everyone}} had 99 days after conviction before they were executed, learns that she is to be executed that day. After a visit by her parents, who express their approval of what she has done, Mohr comes to the prison and sadly watches Sophie taken away. Soon after, she is led into a cell where Christoph Probst and Hans await. They quietly share a cigarette, then embrace. Probst remarks that what they did was not in vain. As Sophie is led into a courtyard, she says, [...] "The sun is still shining". She is brought to the execution chamber and placed in a <b>guillotine.</b> The <b>blade</b> falls and the picture goes black. Footsteps are heard, then Hans's voice exclaiming [...] "Es lebe die Freiheit!" [...] ("Long live Freedom!") before the blade falls again. Probst is brought in next, breathing heavily, before the blade falls once more.|$|R
50|$|The {{straight}} cut {{is the most}} common, usually used on cigars with a smaller ring gauge. This cut uses a quick {{straight cut}} causing {{both ends of the}} cigar to be exposed. The double <b>blade</b> <b>guillotine</b> is preferred by many aficionados over the single blade, because it usually makes a cleaner cut. Cigar scissors are also used to make straight cuts, and may be the best choice for cutting the cigar with exactness. However, the guillotines are usually the most practical, the least expensive, and can be easily and safely carried in shirt or trouser pockets. Most prefer this cut because the entire cap end is exposed allowing for maximum smoke to exit with only minimum buildup occurring around the edge.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{characterize}} the fluidics of axial rotating vitreous cutter probe (RT) {{compared with the}} standard <b>guillotine</b> (regular <b>blade),</b> when tested in Balanced Salt Solution (Alcon Laboratories, Forth Worth, TX). Methods: RT and regular blade (RB) cutter probes connected to the same vitrectomy console used a peristaltic pump. The authors measured instantaneous flow through aspiration tubing proximal to the handpiece, fluid velocity, and acceleration at the port by means of particle image velocimetry. Results: Average flow at aspiration tubing of RT and RB did not vary significantly. Regular blade probes produced higher instantaneous flow fluctuation than RT at any considered cut rate (RB 1, 600 6. 4 ± 5. 3 mL/minute; RB 3, 000 11. 8 ± 6. 3 mL/minute; RT 1, 600 0. 9 ± 0. 7 mL/minute, and RT 3, 000 1. 8 ± 0. 8 mL/minute, respectively. P < 0. 001 in all cases). Regular blade also yield significantly higher fluid velocity at cutter port compared with RT (RB 1, 600 85. 8 ± 70. 1 mm/second; RB 3, 000 81. 6 ± 66. 4 mm/second; RT 1, 600 71. 9 ± 40. 3 mm/second; and RT 3, 000 32. 9 ± 20. 8 mm/second. P < 0. 001 in all cases). Fluid acceleration at the cutter port was higher when the RB was used (RB 1, 600 26. 85 ± 30. 18 mm/second 2; RB 3, 000 33. 76 ± 34. 09 mm/second 2; RT 1, 600 24. 01 ± 21. 94 mm/second 2; and RT 3, 000 16. 62 ± 17. 87 mm/second 2. P < 0. 001 in all cases). Conclusion: RT blade design causes less instantaneous flow fluctuation within the aspiration tubing, and also lower fluid velocity and lower acceleration at the cutter port. Fluidics suggests a safer cutting action and a reduced risk of retinal incarceration. Copyright © by Ophthalmic commnucation society, Inc...|$|R
