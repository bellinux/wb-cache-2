5|$|Annealing is {{the process}} of heating the steel to a {{sufficiently}} <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> to relieve local internal stresses. It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material. Annealing goes through three phases: recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth. The temperature required to anneal a particular steel depends on the type of annealing to be achieved and the alloying constituents.|$|E
5|$|Arc {{discharge}}: {{this is a}} {{high power}} thermal discharge of very <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> (≈10,000 K). It can be generated using various power supplies. It is commonly used in metallurgical processes. For example, {{it is used to}} smelt minerals containing Al2O3 to produce aluminium.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, {{protactinium}} crystallizes in the body-centered tetragonal structure {{which can}} be regarded as distorted body-centered cubic lattice; this structure does not change upon compression up to 53 GPa. The structure changes to face-centered cubic (fcc) upon cooling from <b>high</b> <b>temperature,</b> at about 1200°C. The thermal expansion coefficient of the tetragonal phase between room temperature and 700°C is 9.9/°C.|$|E
40|$|This paper uses {{historical}} {{fluctuations in}} temperature within countries to identify {{its effects on}} aggregate economic outcomes. We find three primary results. First, <b>higher</b> <b>temperatures</b> substantially reduce economic growth in poor countries. Second, <b>higher</b> <b>temperatures</b> may reduce growth rates, not just the level of output. Third, <b>higher</b> <b>temperatures</b> have wide-ranging effects, reducing agricultural output, industrial output, and political stability. These findings inform debates over climate’s role in economic development and suggest the possibility of substantial negative impacts of <b>higher</b> <b>temperatures</b> on poor countries...|$|R

5|$|Carbon is {{the fourth}} most {{abundant}} chemical element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon is abundant in the Sun, stars, comets, and in the atmospheres of most planets. Some meteorites contain microscopic diamonds that were formed when the solar system was still a protoplanetary disk. Microscopic diamonds may also be formed by the intense pressure and <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> at the sites of meteorite impacts.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat is {{thermal energy}} generated from radioactive decay and continual heat loss from Earth's formation. Temperatures at the core–mantle boundary may reach over 4000°C (7,200°F). The <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure in Earth's interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically, resulting in {{portions of the}} mantle convecting upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock. Rock and water is heated in the crust, sometimes up to 370°C (700°F).|$|E
5|$|Incandescent {{lights are}} filled with argon, to {{preserve}} the filaments at <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> from oxidation. It {{is used for the}} specific way it ionizes and emits light, such as in plasma globes and calorimetry in experimental particle physics. Gas-discharge lamps filled with pure argon provide lilac/violet light; with argon and some mercury, blue light. Argon is also used for blue and green argon-ion lasers.|$|E

30|$|Taken together, {{these results}} show that the tcm 5 {{mutation}} affected the third stage of chloroplast development under <b>high</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and the activation of PSII-associated genes is severely weakened, resulting in the suppression of chloroplast development, Chl-biosynthesis and photosynthesis, finally leading to the death under <b>high</b> <b>temperatures.</b> To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence that there exists a unique rice Deg/HtrA protease protein essential for chloroplast development under <b>high</b> <b>temperatures.</b> As for TCM 5, how to participate in chloroplast development and maintain PSII function under <b>high</b> <b>temperatures</b> is needed in the further study.|$|R

The record <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> is 28.8°C (83.8°F) on 2 August 1990, and the record low temperature is -4.5°C (23.9°F) recorded just six months later on 7 February 1991.|$|E
25|$|Ripple and AC {{currents}} mainly warms the capacitor body.

5|$|The <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> stability, low vapor pressure, good wear {{resistance}} and ability to withstand arc corrosion of rhenium are useful in self-cleaning electrical contacts. In particular, the discharge occurring during the switching oxidizes the contacts. However, rhenium oxide Re2O7 has poor stability (sublimes at ~360°C) and therefore is removed during the discharge.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} low {{temperature}} superconductivity {{has been well}} understood since the BCS theory of 1957. It {{is based on a}} peculiarity of the interaction between two electrons in a crystal lattice. However, the BCS theory does not explain <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> superconductivity, and its precise mechanism is still a mystery. What is known is that the composition of the copper-oxide materials must be precisely controlled for superconductivity to occur.|$|E

Malaria incidence increases during periods of <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> and heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium traces in diesel fuels are {{the main}} fuel {{component}} in <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> corrosion. During combustion, vanadium oxidizes and reacts with sodium and sulfur, yielding vanadate compounds with melting points as low as 530°C, which attack the passivation layer on steel and render it susceptible to corrosion. The solid vanadium compounds also abrade engine components.|$|E
5|$|White dripstones {{are pure}} calcite without defilement, the red color {{is given by}} iron oxide (rust) in small amounts.
