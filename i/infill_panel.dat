Due to the slope of the site, the house is elevated on timber stumps at the front but set close to the ground at the rear.

40|$|RC framed {{buildings}} are generally designed without considering the structural action of masonry infill walls present. These walls {{are widely used}} as partitions and considered as non-structural elements. But they affect both the structural and non-structural performance of the RC buildings during earthquakes. RC framed building with open first storey is known as soft storey, which performs poorly during earthquakes. A similar soft storey effect can also appear below plinth, when the ground material has removed during excavation and refilled later. To observe the effect of masonry <b>infill</b> <b>panel,</b> it is modeled as an equivalent diagonal strut. In order to study these six RC framed buildings with brick masonry infill were designed for the same seismic hazard. In the present paper an investigation {{has been made to}} study the behavior of RC frames with various arrangement of infill when subjected to earthquake loading. The results of bare frame, frame with infill, soft ground floor, soft basement and infill in swastika pattern in ground floor are compared and conclusions are made. It is observed that, providing infill below plinth and in swastika pattern in the ground floor improves earthquake resistant behavior of the structure when compared to soft basement.

40|$|When precast {{concrete}} infill panels {{are connected to}} steel frames at discrete locations, interaction at the structural interface is neither complete nor absent. The contribution of {{precast concrete}} infill panels to the lateral stiffness and strength of steel frames can be significant depending on the quality, quantity and location of the discrete interface connections. This paper presents preliminary finite element results of {{an investigation into the}} composite behaviour of a square steel frame with a precast concrete <b>infill</b> <b>panel</b> subject to lateral loading. Earlier, a full scale experiment was performed on a one-storey one-bay 3 by 3 m infilled frame structure which was horizontally loaded at the top and yielded a load displacement curve. The <b>infill</b> <b>panel</b> was connected at the corners {{to the ends of the}} top and bottom beams. This way the connection acts either in tension or compression. Experimental pullout tests on individual Frame-to-Panel-Connections, FPC 4, allowed the load deflection characteristics to be established. This made it possible to model the experimental non-linear behaviour of the connection by multi-linear tensile and compression springs in the finite element model. The results from the finite element model of the infilled frame structure with FPC 4 connections compares well with the experimentally obtained values for initial lateral stiffness, yielding level and ultimate strength. The proposed finite element model of the structure can be used for further parameter studies...|$|E
40|$|A new {{building}} {{system based on}} Semi-Interlocking Masonry (SIM) is being developed at the Centre for Infrastructure Performance and Reliability, University of Newcastle, Australia, to improve the seismic behaviour of framed structures with masonry <b>infill</b> <b>panels.</b> SIM panels are built with dry­stacked masonry units capable of relative sliding in-plane of a panel but locked against relative out-of­plane movement.

40|$|Aimed at {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} openings on the in-plane behaviour of masonry infills in reinforced concrete frames, a parametric study is presented based on model calibration via experimental tests. Two types of openings are investigated: central window openings and different combinations of door and window openings based on the typologies of southern European countries. First, a finite element model of the structure is made using the DIANA software program. Then, after calibration with experimental results, a parametric analysis is carried out to investigate {{the effect of the}} presence and location of the different types of openings on the in-plane behaviour of the infilled frame. Finally, different equations for predicting the initial stiffness and lateral strength of infilled frames with any types of openings were obtained. An α factor related to the geometry of the piers between openings is proposed {{to take into account the}} location of the openings in the developed equations. Subsequently, the masonry <b>infill</b> <b>panel</b> is replaced by a diagonal strut. An empirical equation is also proposed for the width of an equivalent strut to replace a masonry <b>infill</b> <b>panel</b> with openings in such a way that they possess the same initial stiffness.

40|$|Modern {{buildings}} {{should be}} endowed with features that {{allow people to}} carry out their activities in a sustainable environment and {{with a high level of}} safety. The major concern of this work refers to one peculiar aspect that recently is gaining the attention of designers and construction companies: the role of infill panels. There is now an increasing consensus on how these non-structural elements should be carefully designed, both, to increase their thermo-insulating capacity and to adapt their earthquake performance to the most recent standards. It is well known that infill panels are the main source of heat dispersion in buildings, Moreover, in recent seismic events, we have witnessed several dramatic collapses of infill panels that overturned outside of buildings. The need arose almost spontaneously: to conceive a new type of <b>infill</b> <b>panel</b> that could solve these two critical issues. The solution was found in an innovative constructive system for infill panels, in which the traditional hollow-core masonry blocks are connected, rather than with the traditional mortar layers, through joints made from recycled plastic. These joints are constituted of a planar surface with a number of protruding “teeth” on both sides that fit into the holes of the blocks. The constructive system has the advantage of a rapid assemblage, which reduces the construction times, and allows the insertion of insulating panels that reduce the thermal conductivity to very low levels. From the anti-seismic standpoint, the teeth are designed to allow for a certain displacement to occur at the joint level, thus reducing the in-plane stiffness of the <b>infill</b> <b>panel</b> and, as a consequence, its damage; at the same time, they realize an interlocking mechanism that prevents the out-of-plane collapse...|$|E
