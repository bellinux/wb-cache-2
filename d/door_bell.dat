2500|$|That night, Bell {{returns to}} the crime scene and finds the lock blown out. Chigurh hides behind the <b>door.</b> <b>Bell</b> enters Moss's room and sees that the vent has been removed and the duct is empty. Later, Bell visits his uncle Ellis, an ex-lawman, and tells him he plans to retire because he feels [...] "over-matched". Ellis points out that the region has always been violent.|$|E
2500|$|AH-1 Cobras were in {{use by the}} Army {{during the}} Tet {{offensive}} in 1968 and {{through to the end}} of the Vietnam War. Cobras provided fire support for ground forces, escorted transport helicopters and other roles, including aerial rocket artillery (ARA) battalions in the two Airmobile divisions. They also formed [...] "hunter killer" [...] teams by pairing with OH-6A scout helicopters. A team featured one OH-6 flying slow and low to find enemy forces. If the OH-6 drew fire, the Cobra could strike at the then revealed enemy. On 12 September 1968, Capt. Ronald Fogleman was flying an F-100 Super Sabre when the aircraft was shot down and he ejected 200 miles north of Bien Hoa. [...] Fogleman became the only pilot to be rescued by holding on to an Army AH-1G's deployed gun-panel <b>door.</b> <b>Bell</b> built 1,116 AH-1Gs for the U.S. Army between 1967 and 1973, and the Cobras chalked up over a million operational hours in Vietnam; the number of Cobras in service peaked at 1,081. Out of nearly 1,110 AH-1s delivered from 1967 to 1973 approximately 300 were lost to combat and accidents during the war. [...] The U.S. Marine Corps used AH-1G Cobras in Vietnam for a short time before acquiring twin-engine AH-1J Cobras.|$|E
60|$|At this {{juncture}} the <b>door</b> <b>bell</b> rang. Jeeves floated out to answer it.|$|E

5000|$|Along {{with its}} modern elements, the church {{combines}} {{features of the}} traditional California mission style, including the large wood front <b>doors,</b> <b>bell</b> tower, courtyard, and fountain.|$|R
60|$|The front <b>door</b> <b>bell</b> jangled viciously. Somebody {{was coming}} in, making {{a great deal}} of noise.|$|E
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>bell</b> rang again, and {{the waiter}} brought in another bulky parcel, and {{deposited}} {{it on the}} marble-topped centre table.|$|E
60|$|Blanche was so annihilated, {{that the}} sound of a carriage, and of the <b>door</b> <b>bell,</b> was a great {{satisfaction}} to her.|$|E

50|$|She is the {{daughter}} of American film studio executive, Nicholas Schenck. She was also a close friend of actress Marlene Dietrich. In 1963 she had a surprise visit from a queen. Queen Frederika and Princess Irene of Greece was being chased down the road by protestors and were ringing <b>door</b> <b>bells</b> looking for refuge. Marti Stevens heard the bell ring and came to the door dressed in a bath towel. She let them in and gave them both a scotch.|$|R
60|$|Just {{as he had}} {{finished}} his little repast, and was tranquilly stirring a breakfast cup of coffee, the <b>door</b> <b>bell</b> rang.|$|E
60|$|The {{sound of}} the <b>door</b> <b>bell</b> was the first intimation that Harry's {{histories}} had occupied them until long past twelve o'clock.|$|E
60|$|Just {{then the}} <b>door</b> <b>bell</b> rang. Mr Crossley resumed the grave look that was {{habitual}} to hint and next minute Shank Leather was ushered into the room.|$|E
50|$|Until 1561 {{the church}} had a central tower which either {{collapsed}} or was removed, {{as a result of}} alterations to the structure and decoration of the church in line with the changes in theological and liturgical practice during the Protestant Reformation. It has been replaced with the current tower over the west <b>door.</b> <b>Bells</b> were cast for the tower by Roger Purdy. The present tower, the third highest in Somerset, at 142 ft high, is of 3 stages, with the top stage occupying half the total height.|$|R

5|$|The Church of St Cuthbert (which {{tourists}} often {{mistake for}} the cathedral) has a fine Somerset stone tower and a superb carved roof. Originally an Early English building (13th century), {{it was much}} altered in the Perpendicular period (15th century). The nave's coloured ceiling was repainted in 1963 at the instigation of the then Vicar's wife, Mrs Barnett. Until 1561 the church had a central tower which either collapsed or was removed, and has been replaced with the current tower over the west <b>door.</b> <b>Bells</b> were cast for the tower by Roger Purdy.|$|R
6000|$|The front <b>door</b> <b>bell</b> rang. The landlady {{answered}} it. Sarah left Gerard and Denys treed by a {{bear and}} listened. Oh, yes; you would, {{just as she}} did! ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the judge}} {{finished}} {{there was a}} violent ringing of the <b>door</b> <b>bell.</b> Judge Penfold {{opened the door and}} was confronted by Mr. Aaron Woodward, who looked pale and excited.|$|E
60|$|It was half-past ten {{when there}} came a ring at the front <b>door</b> <b>bell.</b> Fouquier-Tinville, half expecting citizen Chauvelin to pay him a final visit, shuffled {{to the door and}} opened it.|$|E
5000|$|That same year, Electric Engineering & Supply Company were {{manufacturers}} and dealers in electric lighting and street railway supplies and specialized {{in the manufacture}} of switchboards, cut outs and [...] "all special designs." [...] The company advertised they could supply batteries, <b>door</b> <b>bells,</b> electric gas lighting outfits, lamps, sockets, switches, rosettes, telephones, fan motors, automatic clocks and electric clocks as well as electric motors and dynamos. They were located at 308 and 310 West Jefferson Street. The manager was H. J. Gorke. and Jesse Lorenzo Hinds was superintendent and former mechanic for the firm.|$|R
60|$|Leaving the street, he went {{round to}} Fairfield Gardens, and {{rang the bell}} at Mr. Gallilee's <b>door.</b> The <b>bell</b> was {{answered}} by a polite old woman--a stranger to him among the servants.|$|R
50|$|After {{being dropped}} of at Kirsch's {{apartment}} by Petra, Bourne finds a tiny transmitter planted on his passport. The <b>door</b> <b>bells</b> rings {{and it is}} Semion Icoupov. A couple of minutes later Arkadin blasts through the window with Devra coming in the back way and armed as well. Icoupov shoots Devra in the chest, but she then manages to shoot him in the shoulder, and he {{runs out of the}} house escaping to a rooftop. Arkadin then catches up with Server and Icoupov in their Mercedes and executes them in cold blood with a SIG Sauer Mosquito.|$|R
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>bell</b> rang, Rilla turned reluctantly stairwards. She {{must answer}} it--there {{was no one}} else in the house; but she hated the idea of callers just then. She went downstairs slowly, and opened the front door.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am very sorry, Miss Lenora," [...] he apologised. [...] "The front <b>door</b> <b>bell</b> must {{be out of}} order. I {{certainly}} didn't hear it ring. Mr. Ashleigh is in his study, if {{you wish}} to see him." ...|$|E
60|$|Gradually, as he waited, {{his mood}} of morbid self-criticism returned. He had sunk once {{more into the}} depths when {{he was aware of}} a soft tapping. The <b>door</b> <b>bell</b> rang very gently. He went to the door and opened it.|$|E
50|$|Miscellaneous {{electric}} use {{includes a}} diverse collection of electronics, such as power adapters, pool pumps, computer equipment, televisions, <b>door</b> <b>bells,</b> phone/fax machines, and many others. MELs {{usually do not}} include major appliances such as refrigerators, stoves, dryers, etc. Although each device may draw {{a small amount of}} power, the large and steadily increasing number of devices can use a significant portion of a home’s energy. In the United States, MELs comprise nearly one quarter of residential energy use, larger than either heating or cooling energy end-use. In low-energy houses, this percentage increases dramatically, because MELs are often ignored while increasing whole-house efficiency.|$|R
50|$|The {{electromechanical}} {{version of}} the switching device includes two stationary contacts and a spring supported moving contact. The spring holds the movable contact {{against one of the}} stationary contacts and an electromagnet pulls the movable contact to the opposite stationary contact. The current in the electromagnet is interrupted by the action of the switch so that the switch continually switches rapidly back and forth. This type of electromechanical inverter switch, called a vibrator or buzzer, was once used in vacuum tube automobile radios. A similar mechanism has been used in <b>door</b> <b>bells,</b> buzzers and tattoo machines.|$|R
5000|$|When Hunt arrived, [...] "Nonteaching {{jobs were}} given out as patronage, {{and the third}} floor of the {{administration}} building was notorious as a distribution center of political plums." [...] In Chicago, he doubled the school district's budget to $146 million, updated facilities with a $50 million building program, raised faculty salaries almost 50%, and relieved them from kickbacks to ward captains and ringing <b>door</b> <b>bells</b> in every election. Chicago was so anxious to hire Hunt that the offered him US$25,000 a year—US$9,000 more than it has ever paid a superintendent before, and US$7,000 more than it paid its mayor at the time.|$|R
60|$|In {{the midst}} of a final {{desultory}} polishing of her silver, Tuppence was disturbed by the ringing of the front <b>door</b> <b>bell,</b> and went to answer it. This time the visitor was neither Whittington nor Boris, but a man of striking appearance.|$|E
60|$|She {{was white}} with fear, {{but he only}} laughed, and stooping down would have taken her hands once more. But at that moment an {{unexpected}} sound intervened. The deep silence {{of the house was}} broken by the ringing of the front <b>door</b> <b>bell.</b>|$|E
60|$|The front <b>door</b> <b>bell</b> rang softly; {{it was a}} timid, hesitating ring, {{as though}} some one had but feebly touched the knob. Foo Cha and his master {{looked at one another}} in silence. There was {{something}} almost ominous in that gentle peal.|$|E
60|$|On {{one side}} the <b>door</b> was a <b>bell</b> handle, {{on the other}} side a press button.|$|R
50|$|The {{trigger for}} a {{radio-controlled}} {{improvised explosive device}} (RCIED) is controlled by radio link. The device is constructed so that the receiver is connected to an electrical firing circuit and the transmitter operated by the perpetrator at a distance. A signal from the transmitter causes the receiver to trigger a firing pulse that operates the switch. Usually the switch fires an initiator; however, the output may {{also be used to}} remotely arm an explosive circuit. Often the transmitter and receiver operate on a matched coding system that prevents the RCIED from being initiated by spurious radio frequency signals or jamming. An RCIED can be triggered from any number of different mechanisms including car alarms, wireless <b>door</b> <b>bells,</b> cell phones, pagers and encrypted GMRS radios.|$|R
50|$|Creighton {{shares her}} {{personal}} encounters of Forerunners, supernatural signs that warn humans of impending deaths. Many tales of Forerunners often involve {{knocks on the}} <b>door,</b> church <b>bells</b> ringing {{when no one else}} can hear them, an owl hooting during the day, or seeing own apparitions of yourself.|$|R
