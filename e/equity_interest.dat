To aid in this goal, Viz launched the magazine with a multimillion-dollar advertising budget, they advertised and distributed the title through mass market outlets rather than just pop culture stores, ensuring the magazine included series already popular with the North American audience due to their airing on Cartoon Network. To help fund the lengthy, expensive marketing campaign developed around Shonen Jump, Shueisha purchased an <b>equity</b> <b>interest</b> in Viz in August 2002.|$|E
5|$|Shonen Jump, officially stylized SHONEN JUMP and {{abbreviated}} SJ, is a shōnen manga anthology {{published in}} North America by Viz Media. It debuted in November 2002 {{with the first}} issue having a January 2003 cover date. Based on Shueisha's popular Japanese magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump, Shonen Jump is retooled for English readers and the American audience, including changing it from a weekly publication to a monthly one. It features serialized chapters from four manga series, and articles on Japanese language and culture, as well as manga, anime, video games, and figurines. Prior to the magazine's launch, Viz launched an extensive marketing campaign to promote it and help it succeed where previous manga anthologies published in North America had failed. Shueisha purchased an <b>equity</b> <b>interest</b> in Viz to help fund the venture, and Cartoon Network, Suncoast, and Diamond Distributors became promotional partners in the magazine.|$|E

25|$|On July 10, 2008, Dow {{agreed to}} {{purchase}} {{all of the}} common <b>equity</b> <b>interest</b> of Rohm and Haas Co. for $15.4 billion, which equated to $78 per share.

The purpose of the deal was to move Dow Chemical further into specialty chemicals, which offer higher profit margins than the commodities market and {{are more difficult to}} enter for the competition. The purchase has been criticized by many on Wall Street who believe Dow Chemical overpaid (about a 75 percent premium on the previous day's market capital) to acquire the company; however, the high bid was needed to ward off competing bids from BASF. The transaction to purchase the outstanding interest of Rohm and Haas closed on April 1, 2009.|$|E
