50|$|In January 1932 in Riga, and in September 1932 in Geneva, Soviet-Romanian {{negotiations}} were held {{as a prelude}} to a non-aggression treaty, and on June 9, 1934, diplomatic relations were established between the two countries. On July 21, 1936, Maxim Litvinov and Nicolae Titulescu, the Soviet and Romanian Ministers of Foreign Affairs, agreed upon a draft of a Mutual Assistance Pact. It was sometimes interpreted as a non-aggression treaty, that would de facto recognize the existing Soviet-Romanian border. The protocol stipulated that any common Romanian-Soviet action should be pre-approved by France. In negotiating with the Soviets for this agreement, Titulescu was highly criticized by the Romanian far right. The protocol was to be signed in September 1936. However, Titulescu was dismissed in August 1936, leading the Soviet side to declare the previously achieved agreement null and void. Subsequently, no further attempts were made to reach a political rapprochement between Romania and the Soviet Union.

40|$|The Courts {{are always}} flooded with a {{multitude}} of civil actions. When a civil action is instituted by a party the law allows the defendant to raise the defence of limitation of action, where the party instituted proceedings outside the given time period. This thesis examines the defence of limitation of action. A person who has a good cause of action against another is given {{a certain period of}} time to institute legal proceedings. His claim should not be barred by statute. This time constraint for instituting proceedings is referred to as limitation of action. The need for a time constraint for instituting proceedings is justified on the grounds that there must be a limit on the level of litigation. More importantly, time constraints may be justified as otherwise there would be no end to stale claims being resurrected against unfortunate defendants, who would continue to remain under the constant threat of legal proceedings. Therefore, from a very early period in time in the development of the common law, statutes were enacted to stipulate time periods within which actions had to be instituted. The effect of these statutory time periods was to prevent any plaintiff, who did not institute' proceedings within the stipulated time period, from pursuing his right in a court of law. Originally, the early statutes of limitation were established with reference to real actions such as distress, entry and proceedings for recovery of realty. The periods of limitation were limited from the occurrence of some recent or fixed era as from the death of a particular king or the coronation of another. Some such event set the beginning of the general limitation period. As for example by the Statute of Merton, 12361 which was the earliest of such statutes, a claimant in a writ could not claim any seisin earlier than the reign of Henry the second and likewise by the Statute of Westminster, no claim could be made earlier than that of Richard the First. These dates were unaltered and allowed to continue for such long periods that with the passage of time they became in effect no limitation at all. Later, the modern concept of a time period commencing on the accrual of a cause of action was established by the Act of Limitation with Proviso, 1540. This statute was the first English Statute to adopt general limitation period based on the commencement of a cause of action. In other words, real actions were limited not from any fixed date or event but according to a fixed interval of antecedent time. From this time, the basic policy of statutes of limitation have remained the same namely to preclude the right of an action after the lapse of the prescribed time. The reason underlying the introduction of limitation periods remains valid that it may often be harsher' to allow a <b>dormant</b> <b>claim</b> to be revived than to prevent it being enforced. So in A Court v Cross 2, Best C. J. said " [...] it has been supposed that the legislature only meant to protect persons who had paid their debts, but from length of time had lost or destroyed the proof of payment. From the title of the act to the last section, every word of it shows that it was not passed on this narrow ground. It is, as I have heard it often called by great judges, an act of peace. Long dormant claims have often more of cruelty than justice in them". The need and justification for limitation periods have been recognised on many occasions by judges, for instance in Board of Trade v Cayzer. Irving & Co 3, Lord Atkinson stated " [...] . the whole purpose of this Limitation Act, is to apply to persons who have good causes of action which they could, if so disposed, enforce and to deprive them of the power of enforcing them after they have lain by for the number of years respectively and omitted to use". Lord Goddard C. J. in Jones v Bellgrove Properties Ltd 4 stressed the problem of evidence which arises if a dormant action is revived. The learned Chief Justice stated " [...] . if a claim is made for payment of a debt many years after it has been incurred, there may be difficulty in proving that the debt ever was in fact incurred or that it was not already paid and so forth. That is why the law bars the right of action after a certain period has elapsed from the accrual of the cause of action [...] ". Finally, in R. B. Polices at Lloyds v Butlers Streatfield J., highlighted the need for finality in litigation and stated that, " [...] it is a policy of the Limitation Act that those who go to sleep upon their claims should not be assisted by the courts in recovering their property, but another, and, I think, equal policy behind these Acts, is that there shall be an end of litigation, and that protection shall be afforded against stale demands". From the several reasons of practicality, justice and finality of litigation which are proposed from time to time to explain the existence of the statutes of limitation, it would be apparent that an attempt is made to protect the defendant as well as the plaintiff. A plaintiff is encouraged not to sleep on his right but to institute proceedings as soon as he possibly could, as delay in prosecuting a claim by him could affect the accurate recollection of facts by him and his witnesses which inevitably could prove fatal to the plaintiff. Defendants on the other hand, are protected from being vexed by stale claims, as after the lapse of time, they could with certainty treat the matter as closed once and for all, and destroy all documentary evidence, which they might have to preserve otherwise. The general law relating to limitation of actions is not exhaustively found in the Limitation Act, 1974 as besides this Act there are various other legislation which provide for time periods for instituting proceedings in various specific cases. This undoubtedly would give rise to conflict between the time provisions provided in the Limitations Act and those provided in the other legislation. Limitation of Actions may not be viewed upon as something worthy of academic consideration, however it is very practical and of immense value to legal practitioners, who view it as a potential time bomb. Further there are a whole body of case law which has evolved around the various aspects of limitation and certainly these are worthy of consideration. Then there is the question of balancing the policies of the Statute of Limitations, namely that of resurrecting stale claims against the undue injustice to a litigant which may result if he is barred from pursuing his claim. For these reasons, a discussion on the Statute of Limitation is justified. In this thesis, I have outlined the historical developments of the Statute of Limitation both in England and in Australia and then examined in detail the scheme and provisions of the Tasmanian Limitation Act. In particular I have looked at the provisions relating to extension of time where in certain instances like in an action for damages for negligence, nuisance, breach of duty, including damages in respect of personal injuries, a judge is given a general discretion to extend the period of limitation for bringing an action. Although a general discretion is granted by the Limitation Act, 1974, to judges, decided cases show that this discretion would be exercised only on certain established criteria and these criteria are examined in this thesis. Besides the general discretion, the Act also contains provisions for specific extension of time in cases where there has been an acknowledgment or part-payment by the defendant. Finally, I have included a chapter on some proposals for reform to the Tasmanian Limitation Act...|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} states, corporations, and {{religious}} groups formally disowning past records of egregious human injustice is mushrooming. Although the Age of Apology is a global phenomenon, the question of reparations—a tort-based mode of redress whereby a wrongdoing group accepts legal responsibility and compensates victims for the damage it inflicted upon them—likely consumes more energy, emotion, and resources in the U. S. {{than in any other}} jurisdiction. Since the final year of the Cold War, the U. S. and its political subdivisions have apologized or paid compensation to Japanese-American internees, native Hawaiians, civilians killed in the Korean War, and African American victims of medical experiments, racial violence, and lending discrimination; a barrage of lawsuits demanding reparations from slavery profiteers is on the dockets of several courts, and more are expected. In the U. S. circa 2004, reparations is the stuff not only of litigation but legislative proposals, academic and popular articles, news editorials, town hall meetings, campus demonstrations, television programs, office water cooler debates, dinner table conversations, and cyberchat groups. If reparations is not a uniquely American remedy, it is no stretch to say that in the U. S. 2 ̆ 2 reparations talk 2 ̆ 2 is very much with us. Still, although advocates maintain that reparations {{is the first step in}} recovering history and fashioning a more equitable collective future, critics describe a divisive and retrospective movement threatening to widen racial and ethnic fault lines running through the American body politic. Consequently, reparative justice is hotly contested on doctrinal, political, and practical grounds: opponents reject the notion of collective harm and responsibility for 2 ̆ 2 ancient wrongs, 2 ̆ 2 deny linkages between the relative socioeconomic status of aggrieved racial minority groups and past injustices, and cling to limiting doctrines that deny remedies for acts and omissions that were lawful centuries ago. Reparations thus fuels unresolvable debates over the nature of minority disenfranchisement, the adequacy of civil rights legislation, the constitutionality of group entitlements, the ideal racial distribution of socioeconomic power, and the appropriate channel to pilot between the pursuit of racial justice and the preservation of social peace. Moreover, because a successful reparations movement might awaken other <b>dormant</b> <b>claims,</b> reparations debates generate resistance and backlash. Nevertheless, even if it can be realized only at the price of social unrest and the painful reopening of old wounds, reparations may well be the appropriate remedy in the case of specific meta-wrongs, foremost among them slavery. A significant element in the slavery reparations claim is the lost value consequence of the unpaid labor extracted from slave ancestors and thus it is logical that, with few exceptions, proponents of slavery reparations equate the remedy with financial compensation. Although money cannot undo history, it can ameliorate the socioeonomic conditions of the descendants of former slaves, and money is the lodestar of most reparationists. However, justice is not a one-size-fits-all commodity, and the potential suitability of compensatory remedies to the harms absorbed by any particular group is not dispositive of, nor even instructive in regard to, the question of whether reparations is appropriate for other claimant groups. Slavery is not the sole, nor the first, nor even, arguably, the most egregious historical injustice for which the U. S. bears responsibility. Moreover, cash is not the primary, or even an important, objective of some aggrieved groups. Non-monetary modes of redress may be more effective in inducing the national government to accept moral responsibility, in restoring the dignity and autonomy of injured groups, and in healing, reconstituting, and relegitimizing the nation. In other words, the specific claims posed by each aggrieved group bear examination and evaluation on their unique merits. Although the interests of groups may converge on particular issues and proposals emerging in reparations debates, what suffices to make one group 2 ̆ 2 whole 2 ̆ 2 may be wholly inadequate for, or even harmful to, another. Prevailing theories of justice, even those drafted in good-faith with the intent that they be universally applicable or at least readily malleable in transit from one application to another, may in fact be so bounded by the cultures and worldviews in which they were incubated that they are unable to recognize, capture, and remedy all the injuries inflicted upon the aggrieved group. Without judging its value as a remedy in general, reparations, as well as other theories of justice sketched and pitched at a high level of abstraction but without a comprehensive analysis of the context and history of the claims of the particular group in question, may, when applied, be useless at best and damaging at worst. Just as all politics is local, so is all (in) justice. For the indigenous people who have inhabited, since time immemorial, the lands within the external borders of the U. S., remediation of historical injustice is a pressing issue. Despite this, reparations would fail to advance, and might even frustrate, important Indian objectives, primarily the reacquisition of the capacity to self-determine as autonomous political communities on ancestral lands. Because the immense injustice at the core of U. S. national history is neither broadly acknowledged nor deeply understood, Part I of this Article provide some historical foundation and briefly sketches the necessary factual predicate to the Indian claim for redress. Part II presents and evaluate several theories of justice with respect to this claim. Part III counters the shortcomings and omissions of these theories with an indigenist theory that propounds a program of land restoration and above all legislative reform intended to accord the full measure of relief to Indian claimants consistent with the requirements of justice for all individuals and groups...|$|R
50|$|Lord Egmont was {{succeeded by}} his eldest son, the third Earl, who sat as a Member of Parliament for Bridgwater.

However, in 1939 the House of Lords allowed the claim of his only son Frederick George Moore Perceval, who became the eleventh Earl (his father having posthumously been deemed the tenth Earl). At his death in 2001, the eleventh Earl was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest and sole surviving son Thomas Frederick Gerald Perceval.
