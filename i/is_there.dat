5|$|As {{is typical}} for ceratosaurs, the abelisaurid hand had four basic digits. However, it <b>is</b> <b>there</b> that any {{similarity}} ends. No wrist bones existed, {{with the four}} palm bones (metacarpals) attaching directly to the forearm. There were no finger bones on the first or fourth digits, only one on the second digit and two on the third digit. These two external fingers were extremely short and immobile. Manual claws were very small in Eoabelisaurus, and totally absent in carnotaurines.|$|E
