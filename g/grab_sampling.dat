Integrative passive samplers are {{an effective way to}} monitor the concentration of organic contaminants in aquatic systems over time. Most aquatic monitoring programs rely on collecting individual samples, often called grab samples, at a specific time. The <b>grab</b> <b>sampling</b> method is associated with many disadvantages that can be resolved by passive sampling techniques. When contaminants are present in trace amounts, <b>grab</b> <b>sampling</b> may require the collection of large volumes of water. Also, lab analysis of the sample can only provide a snapshot of contaminant levels at the time of collection. This approach therefore has drawbacks when monitoring in environments where water contamination varies over time and episodic contamination events occur. Passive sampling techniques have been able to provide a time-integrated sample of water contamination with low detection limits and in situ extraction of analytes.|$|E

5000|$|SPI {{has been}} used to model the {{integrity}} and performance of capped dredge-spoil sites (NOAA 2003) and containment sites (e.g. Parliamentary-Commissioner 1995; Gowing et al. 1997). Detailed acoustic surveys of spoil disposal sites are inherently limited to a vertical resolution of ca. 10 cm (Ramsay 2005). There is considerable evidence that spoil overburden of less than 10 cm affects macrofaunal species (Chang and Levings 1976; Maurer et al. 1982; Maurer et al. 1986; Chandrasekara and Frid 1998; Schratzberger et al. 2000; Cruz-Motta and Collins 2004). Backscatter and high-frequency side-scan sonar techniques may provide faster characterisation of spoil extent, but only when the spoil’s acoustic reflectivity or topology is sufficiently distinct from native sediments. SPI devices produce imagery of the sediment/water interface with sub-millimetre resolution. SPI therefore offers the capability to examine dredge spoil mound morphology, compaction, winnowing, integration with native sediments, and, potentially, biological activity at a scale relevant to the macrofaunal assemblages under study. SPI can be applied to other, perhaps more common, benthic disturbance investigations as well (...) [...] To illustrate, consider a benthic ecological impact study for a hypothetical shellfish mariculture facility. There are an enormous variety of study approaches. Existing information and the available resources inevitably constrain every design. With little information on bottom type, a simple, one-off, spatial impact study like that shown in Figure 5 with eight sites along an isobath, taking three replicate grabs from each, is fairly common and moderately powerful. Prior data gathering including bathymetric, diver, towed-camera, ROV, or side-scan sonar observations would probably alter site placement and greatly enhance overall information and value. Collecting such data over even a small site such as this one requires considerable resources and will probably cause a gap of several days to allow data processing between the first field days and the <b>grab</b> <b>sampling</b> events (It is this delay that precludes, or reduces, the value of studying transient events in hydrodynamically energetic areas). Collecting a large number of point data from an SPI device is easily done where the resulting snapshots of the benthic character are automatically placed on a map of the study area in real time. This approach allows rapid categorisation according to one or more variables of interest. In waters <30 m deep it is not unreasonable to expect to collect the 170 SP images indicated in Figure 6 and produce a rough benthic classification map in a single field day. The categories may be based on sediment texture, overburden, specific detritus, biota, etc. Sampling effort can then be allocated to focus on the variability of communities among the gross habitat differences by using grabs as habitat replicates with varying lag. This type of approach produces a broader understanding of the system and permits more informed decisions by increasing the generality of the grab sample data. The SPI evidence can effectively increase the extent from one dimension to at least two. Correlation between physical and biological data collected from the grabs also allows more data to be extracted from the SP imagery by identifying specific features (infaunal species, tubes, mounds, etc.). Furthermore, a detailed analysis of ARPD depths can then be presented as geochemical environment contours.|$|E
40|$|The {{suitability}} of passive samplers (Chemcatcher) {{as an alternative}} to <b>grab</b> <b>sampling</b> in estimating time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations and total loads of herbicides was assessed. <b>Grab</b> <b>sampling</b> complemented deployments of passive samplers in a tropical waterway in Queensland, Australia, before, during and after a flood event. Good agreement was observed between the two sampling modes in estimating TWA concentrations that was independent of herbicide concentrations ranging over 2 orders of magnitude. In a flood-specific deployment, passive sampler TWA concentrations underestimated mean grab sampler (n = 258) derived concentrations of atrazine, diuron, ametryn, and metolachlor by an average factor of 1. 29. No clear trends were evident in the ratios of load estimates from passive samplers relative to grab samples that ranged between 0. 3 and 1. 8 for these analytes because of the limitations of using TWA concentrations to derive flow-weighted loads. Stratification of deployments by flow however generally resulted in noticeable improvements in passive sampler load estimates. By considering the magnitude of the uncertainty (interquartile range and the root-mean-squared error) of load estimates a modeling exercise showed that passive samplers were a viable alternative to <b>grab</b> <b>sampling</b> since between 3 and 17 grab samples were needed before <b>grab</b> <b>sampling</b> results had less uncertainty.

To reduce these residues, research to improve knowledge of the dynamics of antibiotic release from hospitals is essential. Therefore, we undertook a study to estimate seasonal and temporal variation in antibiotic release from two hospitals in India over a period of two years. For this, 6 sampling sessions of 24 hours each were conducted in the three prominent seasons of India, at all wastewater outlets of the two hospitals, using continuous and <b>grab</b> <b>sampling</b> methods. An in-house wastewater sampler was designed for continuous sampling. Eight antibiotics from four major antibiotic groups were selected for the study. To understand the temporal pattern of antibiotic release, each of the 24 -hour sessions were divided in three sub-sampling sessions of 8 hours each. Solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to determine the antibiotic residues.
