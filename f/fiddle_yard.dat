5000|$|Using {{one or more}} fiddle yards (US: staging tracks) to {{represent}} {{the rest of the}} railway system. A <b>fiddle</b> <b>yard</b> is regarded as off-scene; it may hold multiple complete trains, and may also be subject to direct human intervention (fiddling) to re-arrange trains, ...|$|E
5000|$|A <b>fiddle</b> <b>yard</b> or {{staging yard}} is a {{collection}} of model railway tracks that are hidden from view and allow trains to be stored and manipulated by the operators. These tracks are used to allow most model railways to be operated in a realistic manner. Whilst it is possible to have a realistic shunting yard in view, its operation is generally unreliable with models.|$|E

5000|$|Cyril John Freezer (19 February 1924 - 19 May 2009) was an English railway modeller, writer, and {{magazine}} editor. He edited Railway Modeller from 1950 to 1978, and Model Railways from 1978 until 1983. He also wrote many articles for Model Railroader. Freezer popularised the 'terminus to <b>fiddle</b> <b>yard</b> layout', {{is credited with}} inventing the [...] "rabbit warren layout", and published many books on model railway, {{many of which are}} considered classics in the field.|$|E
5000|$|As a model, {{the layout}} took many {{features}} of the urban original and turned them to its advantage. The low-level urban setting of the Metropolitan {{was surrounded by a}} retaining wall which provided an obvious scenic break to the model. It also justified the popular, but sometimes contrived, technique of a tunnel exit to the off-board <b>fiddle</b> <b>yard.</b> Fiddle yards, and their use for the [...] "Fiddle Yard to Terminus" [...] layout, were themselves a technique earlier popularised by Freezer.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>fiddle</b> <b>yard</b> {{is part of}} a layout, and as such {{varies with}} the type layout design, {{particularly}} whether it is of the [...] "end-to-end" [...] or [...] "continuous run" [...] type. There may be more than one yard per layout. The design also varies by how much the operator wishes to handle the stockâ€”they can be completely manual, completely automatic, or somewhere in between. Each design has different space requirements which must be factored into consideration at the design stage.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Minories layout was 1 x 7 ft in size, {{with the}} <b>fiddle</b> <b>yard</b> additional to this. It folded in half lengthwise, using a removable girder road bridge {{to hide the}} hinges. A two-section folding baseboard was an obvious plan for a layout, as the sections could fold in on themselves to make a protected storage box. However this also required the hinges to be above 'ground level' to allow height for buildings etc., usually difficult to achieve for rural scenes, but easily done here with the retaining wall and bridge.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the properties which line St Andrew Street are listed. From the late 18th century until more recent times there were habitable yards, of which only two names remain: Brewhouse Lane - which was rebuilt in a traditional style - and Victoria Place - now extended.The former <b>Fiddle</b> <b>Yard</b> is now Arbon Court, with newly completed houses for sale. Other yards and property were swept away by the relief road in the 1960s and the Oaken Buildings were eventually replaced by the St Andrew Street car park.|$|E
5000|$|Fiddle yards {{were first}} built by British modellers {{so that they}} could build small layouts and operate them in a {{realistic}} manner. The first well-known model railway to use them was 'Maybank', which was exhibited at the 1939 Model Railway Club exhibition in London. This was an urban passenger terminus that led directly into a <b>fiddle</b> <b>yard,</b> hidden beneath a locomotive depot above it. It had an influence on C. J. Freezer, who as editor of Railway Modeller, would later go on to popularise them. In the 1950s he described the [...] "Fiddle Yard to Terminus" [...] layout, and used it for his influential 'Minories' design.|$|E
50|$|The layout is {{a simple}} {{circular}} loop. Points are limited to just one, perhaps two, small sidings and these are more decorative than useful for shunting. A siding {{to the outside of}} the loop requires a larger baseboard. A siding inside the loop may do so too: the siding's radius must be smaller than that of the running loop, which is already close to the minimum radius. Allowing the loop to be a little larger, so as to permit a tighter siding curve within it, means a larger loop and baseboard. This can be done most compactly by stretching the circular loop to an oval, but keeping the same radius with an added straight; the point comes off the straight portion. In rare cases, a <b>fiddle</b> <b>yard</b> has been incorporated into a hidden part of the layout.|$|E
