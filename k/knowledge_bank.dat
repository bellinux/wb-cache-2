This new online economic world has led to an exponential development of <b>banking</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Being the most disciplined financial entities, the banks are especially interested in <b>banking</b> <b>knowledge.</b> This is not limited only to the knowledge of work norms and banking procedures, to the use of algorithms for calculation of financial banking indicators. In this IT era, the diplomatic and psychological dimensions of <b>banking</b> <b>knowledge</b> have been developed.

The various components of BKMM are described in detail so as to explain the progress of <b>knowledge</b> management in <b>banking</b> operations. Then, using the BKMM as a reference, two case studies, one of Tiger Bank and the other of the Camel Bank, were analyzed to study the progress of knowledge management application.
