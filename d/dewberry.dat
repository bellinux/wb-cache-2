25|$|The EBK {{gathered}} berries {{for consumption}} and also prepared {{a number of}} wild plants, judging from the seed remains of plants {{that could not be}} consumed without preparation. Of the berries that have been found are raspberry (Rubus idaeus), <b>dewberry</b> (Rubus caesius), wild strawberry, and the somewhat less palatable dogwood (Cornus sanguinea), hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna and C.oxyacantha), rowanberry (Sorbus aucuparia), crab apple and rose hips.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dewberries</b> are a {{group of}} species in the genus Rubus, section Rubus, {{closely related to the}} blackberries. They are small {{trailing}} (rather than upright or high-arching) brambles with aggregate fruits, reminiscent of the raspberry, but are usually purple to black instead of red. Unlike many other Rubus species, <b>dewberries</b> have separate male and female plants (they are dioecious).|$|R
50|$|Various hybrids and cultivars {{have been}} {{developed}} from the wild form of R. caesius, including 'Youngberry' (a raspberries, blackberries, and <b>dewberries</b> hybrid), olallie blackberry and marionberry.|$|R

25|$|Large shrubs such as red-osier dogwood, beaked willow, saskatoon, chokecherry and pincherry, {{along with}} the smaller shrubs {{including}} prickly rose, snowberry, beaked hazelnut and high bush cranberry, form a dense entangled understory. Dense shrubbery is a typical feature in aspen-dominated forests. Common herbs found in the woodlands include: Lindleyâ€™s aster (Aster ciliolatus), northern bedstraw (Galium boreale), pea vine, Western Canada violet (Viola canadensis), <b>dewberry</b> and bunchberry. Mosses appear {{at the base of}} trees and on the ground.|$|E
25|$|Series Two of The Apprentice (UK), a British reality {{television}} series, {{was broadcast}} in the UK during 2006 on BBC Two, from 22 February to 10 May 2006. As {{the show was}} renewed by the BBC, Lord Alan Sugar (then Sir Alan {{at the time of}} broadcast), Nick Hewer and Margaret Mountford returned in their respective roles, while the broadcaster commissioned and ran a new companion discussion program called , which was aired on BBC Three alongside the series, interviewing all the candidates who were fired after each episode was aired, including the runner-up and the overall winner. Like the previous series, fourteen candidates took part, naming their teams Velocity and Invicta, with Michelle <b>Dewberry</b> winning the series.|$|E

500|$|The single reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on December 20, 1910. The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "Here is a rather exaggerated farce with a good many laughs in it. It has for its basis recent cartoons, but has original treatment. The male members of the cast seemed to enjoy their roles, perhaps {{for the reason that}} it is a man's picture; the laugh seems on the ladies." [...] A more contemporary analysis of the film was covered in a paper by Eric <b>Dewberry,</b> who credits this film as Thanhouser's first film portraying suffragists. <b>Dewberry</b> writes that the film presents the idea of a woman mayor, something which was not farfetched for women to find to be humorous. Despite Jack's lack of power in the new era which he awakes to, he managed to win the heart of a powerful woman and easily restore the rights of men. Taken one way, the film seems to advance the idea that a women of power are controlled by their hearts. Dewing writes, [...] "On the one hand it mocks many female suffrage [...] "fighting tactics," [...] as suffragists, in an attempt to not appear too extremist and alienable, exploited conservative ideas of feminine virtue in order to assert their citizenship and reform desires. In the film, the man assumes effeminate passions to woo the Mayor. On the other hand, those sympathetic to the cause can see this as proof that these tactics can work in politics. The film also toys with the fears men harbored concerning the loss of power over females in public spaces, a threat to masculinity and manhood." [...] The film is also believed to have been the first adaptation of Curwood's work.|$|E

[...] The Yellow Jackets' offense was led by All-ACC quarterback John <b>Dewberry</b> and receiver Gary Lee, though leading rushers Cory Collier and Jerry Mays were out with injuries. Linebacker Ted Roof and lineman Pat Swilling led the Jackets' elite [...] "Black Watch" [...] unit on defense.|$|E
50|$|Youngberry is {{a complex}} hybrid between three {{different}} species from the genus Rubus, the raspberries, blackberries, and <b>dewberries</b> of the rose family. The berries of the plant are eaten fresh or used to make juice, jam, and in recipes.|$|R
60|$|They tried {{several of}} the islands, but found them soft and uncertain, and so rowed over to the shore on the west. Here was a little hill, covered with <b>dewberries,</b> and having cleared a spot, they erected their tent and built a campfire.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dewberries</b> {{are common}} {{throughout}} most of the Northern Hemisphere, sometimes thought of as a nuisance weed, but the leaves can be used for a tea, and the berries are sweet and edible. They can be eaten raw, or used to make cobbler, jam, or pie.|$|R

They attempt to shoot Papa with a bullet that grazes his temple. However, this startles the horse into running off, causing the wagon to fall and crush [...] Papa's leg. Mr. Morrison attacks the Wallaces, snapping <b>Dewberry</b> Wallace's back. Later, Mr. Granger uses his banking influence to make the Logan's mortgage note due for full payment within a week even though the Logans had four more years to pay it. Uncle Hammer sells his car and other items, leaving the Logans able to pay the mortgage.|$|E

60|$|Ashurst {{spent the}} next week {{confirming}} the restoration of his leg, by exploration of the country within easy reach. Spring was a revelation to him this year. In a kind of intoxication he would watch the pink-white buds of some backward beech tree sprayed up in the sunlight against the deep blue sky, or the trunks and limbs of the few Scotch firs, tawny in violent light, or again, on the moor, the gale-bent larches which had such a look of life when the wind streamed in their young green, above the rusty black underboughs. Or he would lie on the banks, gazing at the clusters of dog-violets, or up in the dead bracken, fingering the pink, transparent buds of the <b>dewberry,</b> while the cuckoos called and yafes laughed, or a lark, from very high, dripped its beads of song. It was certainly different from any spring he had ever known, for spring was within him, not without. In the daytime he hardly saw the family; and when Megan brought in his meals she always seemed too busy in the house or among the young things in the yard to stay talking long. But in the evenings he installed himself in the window seat in the kitchen, smoking and chatting with the lame man Jim, or Mrs. Narracombe, while the girl sewed, or moved about, clearing the supper things away. And sometimes, with the sensation a cat must feel when it purrs, he would become conscious that Megan's eyes--those dew-grey eyes--were fixed on him {{with a sort of}} lingering soft look which was strangely flattering.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>dewberries</b> {{are often}} too {{scattered}} and {{small to be}} an important traditional food for aboriginal groups in North America, those groups living in southern and eastern parts of the continent used the roots medicinally, to relieve various stomach ailments or to treat women with pregnancy or menstruation-related problems.|$|R
50|$|The blackberries, as well {{as various}} other Rubus species with mounding or {{rambling}} growth habits, are often called brambles. However, this name is not used for those like the raspberry that grow as upright canes, or for trailing or prostrate species, such as most <b>dewberries,</b> or various low-growing boreal, arctic, or alpine species.|$|R
50|$|An {{individual}} raspberry weighs 3 - 5 g, and {{is made up}} {{of around}} 100 drupelets, each of which consists of a juicy pulp and a single central seed. A raspberry bush can yield several hundred berries a year. Unlike blackberries and <b>dewberries,</b> a raspberry has a hollow core once it is removed from the receptacle.|$|R

5000|$|Rubus aboriginum is a bushy, viny bramble, up to 6 ft {{in height}} and breadth, but often smaller. Branches appear 'hairy' when young, and become smooth as they mature, with infrequent, short, hooked thorns. Leaves are ovate, with {{serrated}} edges; flowers are white, have five petals, and are about 1 in in diameter. Fruits resemble other <b>dewberries</b> or small blackberries.|$|R
50|$|Root {{would have}} built his shacks out of driftwood, packing crates and {{anything}} else that washed up on shore. Root hunted and fished to support himself in the harsh environment - he would become fond of raw fish in particular. Reportedly a dead cow once washed up on the shore of Presque Isle and Root fed off of it for an entire week (without using any implements to either cook or eat the animal). Root also ate local wild plants such as wild cattails, duck potatoes, spatterdocks, rice, blueberries, <b>dewberries,</b> and wild strawberries.|$|R
5000|$|Rubus is a {{large and}} diverse genus of {{flowering}} plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, subfamily Rosoideae, with 250-700 species. Raspberries, blackberries, and <b>dewberries</b> are common, widely distributed members of the genus. Most of these plants have woody stems with prickles like roses; spines, bristles, and gland-tipped hairs are also common in the genus. The Rubus fruit, sometimes called a bramble fruit, is an aggregate of drupelets. The term [...] "cane fruit" [...] (or [...] "cane-fruit") applies to any Rubus species or hybrid which is commonly grown with supports such as wires or canes, including raspberries, blackberries, and hybrids such as loganberry, boysenberry, marionberry and tayberry.|$|R

50|$|The native flora of {{the area}} {{includes}} oak, pine, holm and kermes oak, interspersed with meadows of lavender (Lavandula stoechas). There are cultivated almond trees, grape vines, and cherry trees. At elevations above 800 meters, the scrub oaks give way to forest vegetation, including maritime and Corsican pines, which have been cultivated throughout the 20th century. At lower elevations, there are also cultivated Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), walnut, horse chestnut, ash, maple, laurel, and cypress trees. Near the water there is a diverse flora, including willows, belfry, reeds (Phragmites australis, Typha angustifoli, Juncus articulatus, Juncus inflexus), grasses (Imperata cylindrica), yellow iris, poplar, tamarisk, plum feral, cherry feral, elms, vines (Clematis vitalba, Vitis vinifera, and ivy), wild roses, wild broom (Osyris alba), <b>dewberries</b> and blackberries.|$|R
6000|$|Thus did a new element {{come into}} Aurelia's life. She {{carefully}} prepared Harriet's favourite song, a French romance, but Mr. Belamour {{did not like}} it equally well with the Nightingale, which he made her repeat, rewarding her by telling her of the charming looks and manners of her mother, so that she positively enjoyed her visit. The next night he made inquiries into her walks at Bowstead, asking after the favourite nooks of his childhood, and directing her to the glades where grew the largest <b>dewberries</b> and sweetest blackberries. This led to her recital of a portion of Midsummer Night's Dream, for he drew her on with thanks at every pause: [...] "I have enjoyed no such treat for many years," [...] he said.|$|R
5000|$|Jenkins was {{adept at}} more than just ballads, turning out one song after another, as his {{stepdaughter}} Irene described it, like a mill grinding wheat.
