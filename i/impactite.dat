25|$|Impact breccias {{are thought}} to be {{diagnostic}} of an impact event such as an asteroid or comet striking the Earth and are normally found at impact craters. Impact breccia, a type of <b>impactite,</b> forms during the process of impact cratering when large meteorites or comets impact with the Earth or other rocky planets or asteroids. Breccia of this type may be present on or beneath the floor of the crater, in the rim, or in the ejecta expelled beyond the crater.|$|E
500|$|Elsebeth Thomsen of the University of Copenhagen {{proposed}} a different hypothesis in 1980. She {{suggested that the}} Black Stone may be a glass fragment or <b>impactite</b> from {{the impact of a}} fragmented meteorite that fell some 6,000 years ago at Wabar, a site in the Rub' al Khali desert 1,100km east of Mecca. The craters at Wabar are notable for the presence of blocks of silica glass, fused by the heat of the impact and impregnated with beads of a nickel-iron alloy from the meteorite (most of which was destroyed in the impact). Some of the glass blocks are made of shiny black glass, with a white or yellow interior and gas-filled hollows, which allow them to float on water. Although scientists did not become aware of the Wabar craters until 1932, they were located near a caravan route from Oman and were very likely known to the inhabitants of the desert. The wider area was certainly well-known; in ancient Arabic poetry, Wabar or Ubar (also known as [...] "Iram of the Pillars") was the site of a fabulous city that was destroyed by fire from the heavens because of the wickedness of its king. If the estimated age of the crater is accurate, it would have been well within the period of human habitation in Arabia and the impact itself may have been witnessed. A recent (2004) scientific analysis of the Wabar site suggests that the impact event happened much more recently than first thought and might have occurred only within the last 200–300 years.|$|E
40|$|A {{catalog of}} lunar {{plutonic}} rocks and granulitic <b>impactites</b> {{belonging to the}} ANT suite has been compiled. The coarser-grained, plutonic rocks in the compilation are probably pristine; they belong to two groups, Mg-rich plutonic rocks and anorthosites, with a preponderance of the latter type. The granulitic <b>impactites,</b> however, have bulk and mineral compositions that fall {{between the two groups}} defined by the pristine nonmare samples of Warren and Wasson (1977). Thus the granulitic <b>impactites</b> may have originated by metamorphism of mixed <b>impactites</b> in early breccia sheets. The catalog, representative of the lunar crust before the end of heavy bombardment, suggests a crust with over 78 vol. % plagioclase and about equal proportions of material with noritic and troctolitic affinity...|$|R
40|$|It is {{suggested}} that feldspathic granulitic <b>impactites,</b> which are characterized by a high model plagioclase content of between 70 and 80 %, all formed in the period after consolidation of the lunar crust and before the final bombardment. The granulitic <b>impactites</b> contain essentially no KREEP component, which suggests that KREEP appeared on the lunar surface mostly after {{the formation of the}} granulitic <b>impactites,</b> at about the start of the final bombardment. The granulite metamorphism indicated by the matrix textures of these samples requires 1000 C temperatures for prolonged periods of time. The apparent sequence of formation is granulitic <b>impactites</b> before the final bombardment, crystalline-matrix breccias during the final bombardment, and vitric-matrix breccias after the final bombardment. The sequence is consistent with a described thermal model of breccia lithification and with characteristics of the decay of the meteorite flux rate...|$|R

50|$|There is {{no doubt}} that there is impact {{material}} in the form of glassy <b>impactite</b> and shocked quartz in the Rio Cuarto structures. The age of this material has been questioned, and estimated to more than 500,000 BP, from an unknown source crater. There may have been a second, more recent event at around 10,000 BP which produced a second layer of <b>impactite</b> glass.|$|E
40|$|The Bukit Bunuh in Malaysia has {{recently}} been identified as an impact structure after the discovery of possible impact-melt-like rocks and impact breccias from this area. The impact event {{is believed to have}} occurred around 1. 34 - 1. 84 Ma. Twelve impact-related rocks from this suspected impact structure were analysed in the present study for platinum group of element (PGE) content. The sample population includes proximal <b>impactites</b> (two impact-melt rocks and three impact breccias) and possible impact-related rocks (four mylonites) and basement granite (three in number). The results showed no observable clear distinction between the <b>impactites</b> and basement granite. Compared to other asteroid impact sites in the world, the <b>impactites</b> and impact-related rocks in the Bukit Bunuh structure clearly contain a lower concentration of PGEs. Even though previous studies reported possible evidences of shock metamorphism in the Bukit Bunuh structure and electrical resistivity survey favoured the presence of asteroid impact structure in this area as well, the absence of a clear projectile signature in our study on PGE hinders further discussion on the existence and nature of the impact. We suggest that the absence of any PGE signature in the Bukit Bunuh <b>impactites</b> could be indicative either of (1) an achondrite projectile, or (2) an oblique impact or (3) the presence of a volatile-rich layer...|$|R

40|$|The Haughton impact {{structure}} {{has been the}} focus of systematic, multi-disciplinary field and laboratory research activities over the past several years. Regional geological mapping has refined the sedimentary target stratigraphy and constrained the thickness of the sedimentary sequence at the time of impact to similar to 1880 m. New Ar- 40 -Ar- 39 dates place the impact event at similar to 39 Ma, in the late Eocene. Haughton has an apparent crater diameter of similar to 23 km, with an estimated run (final crater) diameter of similar to 16 km. The structure lacks a central topographic peak or peak ring, which is unusual for craters of this size. Geological mapping and sampling reveals that a series of different <b>impactites</b> are present at Haughton. The volumetrically dominant crater-fill impact melt breccias contain a calcite-anhydrite-silicate glass groundmass, all of which have been shown to represent impact-generated melt phases. These <b>impactites</b> are, therefore, stratigraphically and genetically equivalent to coherent impact melt rocks present in craters developed in crystalline targets. The crater-fill <b>impactites</b> provided a heat source that drove a post-impact hydrothermal system. During this time. Haughton would have represented a transient, warm, wet microbial oasis. A subsequent episode of erosion, during which time substantial amounts of <b>impactites</b> were removed, was followed by the deposition of intra-crater lacustrine sediments of the Haughton Formation during the Miocene. Present-day intra-crater lakes and ponds preserve a detailed paleoenvironmental record dating back to the last glaciation in the High Arctic. Modern modification of the landscape is dominated by seasonal regional glacial and niveal melting, and local periglacial processes. The impact processing of target materials improved the opportunities for colonization and has provided several present-day habitats suitable for microbial life that otherwise do not exist in the surrounding terrain...|$|R
50|$|It is 14 km in {{diameter}} and the age {{is estimated to be}} less than 345 million years (Carboniferous). It is older than that of Aorounga because its coverage of <b>impactite</b> has disappeared as a result of erosion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Impactite</b> {{includes}} shock-metamorphosed target rocks, melts (suevites) and {{mixtures of}} the two, {{as well as}} sedimentary rocks with significant impact-derived components (shocked mineral grains, tektites, anomalous geochemical signatures, etc.). In June 2015, NASA reported that impact glass has been detected on the planet Mars—such material may contain preserved signs of ancient life—if life existed.|$|E
50|$|The {{glass is}} an <b>impactite</b> {{resulting}} from the melting of local rocks due {{to the impact of}} a large meteorite. The assumed source is a 1.2-kilometer-wide topographic depression known as Darwin Crater. The crater is filled with 230 m of sediments and breccia. A crater of that size would be created by a meteorite 20 to 50 m in diameter and its impact with Earth would release 20 megatons of energy.|$|E
40|$|The Gardnos impact {{structure}} in southern Norway {{is one of}} only two known impact structures (among similar to 175) whose <b>impactites</b> contain significant amounts (typically 0. 2 - 1. 0 wt. %) of carbon, or 5 to 10 times the amount present in the target rocks; Sudbury, Canada is the other. This study extends a previous investigation of the geochemistry and petrology of Gardnos <b>impactites</b> (French et al., 1997) with additional sampling and a detailed investigation of the nature and possible origin of the carbonaceous material present. Two principal carbon components have been identified in Gardnos impactites: (1) impact-produced diamonds, 0. 5 to 1 mum in size, with a cubic crystal structure, predominantly hexagonal morphologies with platey layers and an estimated concentration of lt 0. 19 ppm in Gardnos suevites and (2) graphitic carbon ranging from poorly ordered to moderately crystalline. Geochemical data suggests that there are no suitable target rocks that could provide a single source for the carbon in Gardnos <b>impactites.</b> However, Raman spectroscopy, stable isotope analysis and transmission electron microscopy of the impact diamonds and graphitic carbon suggests that there were at least two episodes of C emplacement in Gardnos impactites: an impact- related incorporation and shock transformation of graphitic material from target rocks followed by later mobilization of C, possibly during postimpact cooling or later regional metamorphism...|$|R

50|$|Heavily eroded, it is {{presently}} 65 km in diameter {{though it is}} thought to be originally 120 km before erosion.

40|$|Thus far, {{detailed}} petrologic {{studies of}} shock metamorphism {{have been performed}} on samples recovered from laboratory experiments and on a few natural <b>impactites.</b> The loading history of these samples is quite different: In particular, laboratory experiments spend {{only a short time}} (less than 1 microsec) at peak pressure, whereas natural <b>impactites</b> may have stress pulses from 0. 1 - 1 ms. On the other hand, laboratory experiments have known stress histories; natural <b>impactites</b> do not. Natural samples are also subjected to thousands or millions of years of postshock annealing and/or weathering. A useful intermediate case is that of nuclear detonation. Stress pulses for these events can reach 0. 1 ms or higher, and samples are obtained in pristine condition. All three types of loading produce stresses of hundreds of kilobars. Samples studied were taken from the Sedan nulcear test site, and consist of a coarse-grained granodiorite containing quartz, K-feldspar, cordierite, and hornblende. Samples were studied optically in this section, then were thinned with an ion mill and studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Optically, quartz and K-feldspar displayed numerous sets of planar deformation features (PDF's) identical to the nondecorated PDF's seen in laboratory samples and many natural <b>impactites.</b> TEM study showed that the PDF's in quartz and feldspar corresponded to densely packed wide transformation lamellae identical to those described in laboratory studies. The transformation lamellae in both minerals were amorphous, with no sign of high-pressure phases. In the case of K-feldspar only, narrow sublamellae extended outward from some wide lamellae. Quartz, which was more abundant and studied more extensively, contained no shock-induced dislocations. Some planar features were also seen in cordierite, but could not be identified due to rapid beam damage. No shock defects were seen in hornblende in TEM. The shock-induced defects present at the Sedan site are very similar to those seen in shock recovery experiments, and also to those present at certain natural events (e. g., Meteor Crater). This suggests that shock deformation in quartz is not strongly dependent on shock pulse duration, and that laboratory recovery experiments are useful simulations of natural impact events...|$|R
