One response was to evade the risks of demesne farming in favour of the secure income stream from leases: the Shropshire demesnes {{seem to have been}} contracted from [...] 21 carucates in 1291 to 12 in 1355. There were other consolidations. Abbot Adam of Cleobury in 1344 traded the abbey's right to cut timber in the king's woods across the county, which was often hard to exploit because of poor communications, for 240 acres of nearby Lythwood, although the <b>exchange</b> <b>cost</b> £100 at the time and an annual rent of £3. The Black Death brought a much worse crisis. Repeated outbreaks of the plague reduced the labour force so that in 1354 Bishop Northburgh blamed the scarcity of labour for the disrepair of many buildings, although he warned the abbey to look after its investment in Lythwood. The next abbot, Henry of Alston, died after a short period of office and soon there were not even enough priests. In 1365 Abbot Nicholas Stevens and the prior of Coventry were each granted a faculty by the Pope to ordain ten to make up the numbers.

50|$|In 1988, Governor Ahmed {{achieved}} the first debt reduction transaction {{in the international}} markets by restructuring the trade arrears of Nigeria into CBN Promissory Notes. The restructuring was done on a voluntary basis, with over 2/3 of the noteholders agreeing to the restructuring at a bondholders meeting at Wembley Conference Centre in London. Governor Ahmed convinced noteholders to accept the debt reduction deal by allowing creditors to set strict terms of default for the notes. The Governor feared that subsequent Nigerian administrations would attempt to renege on the note payments, so he permitted creditors to set very harsh terms of default for the notes. As a result, the Promissory Notes, which totalled over USD 5 billion, were paid in full on January 2010, and Nigeria's credit rating has greatly improved as a result. This transaction, and Nigeria's performance on the CBN Notes, allowed Nigeria to restructure another $5 billion of bank debt into Brady Bonds in 1992. Brady Bonds also had an element of debt reduction, which greatly lowered Nigeria foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|E

The project was dismissed by ministry of energy led by its minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who accepted the Soviet studies instead as Bhutto favored the idea to establish one single enormous steel mill based 100% imported steel and iron ore instead of local ore at Kalabagh District. In June 1966, another West-German steel firm, the Salzgitter AG produced ~5,000 tonnes of quality steel from 15,000 tonnes of Kalabagh iron ore in the presence of some international experts, and sold it to Volkswagen. The company offered in August 1967 to set up Kalabagh Steel Mill of over 0.8 million tonnes per year capacity based on Kalabagh iron ore and imported coal at an estimated cost of Rs. 1.55Bn, including foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>cost</b> of Rs. 878Mn.

After {{completing}} his doctoral degree at Wisconsin, he began an academic career at the University of California, Santa Cruz economics department. Kennet began his collaboration with David Gabel during these years, a collaboration which continues to bear investigative fruit throughout Kennet’s career in economics and regulation. He spent several years afterward (1989-1992) at Tulane University’s economics department. Moving to Washington, Kennet worked {{for a number of}} years as a researcher at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and was seconded briefly to the U.S. Bureau of the Census to work as a researcher in the Center for Economic Studies. In 1997, Kennet accepted a position as senior economist at the Federal Communications Commission, where he was part of a group of economists and engineers who developed the Hybrid Cost Proxy Model (HCPM), a network simulation tool utilized for determining the forward-looking economic cost of telecommunications networks. HCPM was a logical extension of Kennet’s earlier work with David Gabel in the development of another network simulation tool, the Local <b>Exchange</b> <b>Cost</b> Optimization Model (LECOM). While at the FCC, Kennet taught graduate econometrics at Johns Hopkins University as an adjunct professor.|$|E

40|$|We take a {{critical}} {{view of the}} standard approach to finance and growth. The mapping between the theory and empirics is shown to be poorly understood, and this is traced to deficiencies {{in our understanding of}} the microeconomics at play. By looking at both primary and secondary historical evidence we argue that issues of aggregation are critical, and that spatial factors are also prevalent. Further, we suggest that these disaggregated elements can change over the course of an industrial revolution. A model in the spirit of standard finance and growth theories is extended to consider these further effects, and we calibrate the model to data on historical growth paths. In order to advance our understanding of the microeconomic factors that cause the observed phenomena in the finance-growth nexus, we develop a general equilibrium theory of financial intermediation in which <b>exchange</b> <b>costs</b> are endogenously determined by technologies, endowments and preferences. We suggest that incomplete contracts might be central to these phenomena. We link this framework to an understanding of power and political economy in a setting with heterogeneous agents. We develop these results numerically, showing a number of interesting interactions between markets, <b>exchange</b> <b>costs</b> and institutions in economies with different levels of wealth. The model of endogenous <b>exchange</b> <b>costs</b> can be thought of in terms of the findings coming out of our historical analysis. We outline in some detail the further steps that need to be taken before we can speak of the microfoundations of finance and growth with any confidence. First, a fully dynamic model of markets and coalitions must be embedded within a story of economic growth that can match the dynamic observations. Second, we must develop our conception of incomplete contracting and the link with institutions and political economy. The thesis thus opens a number of interesting avenues for future research.

Besides this, distributed approach, which employs self reliant load balancing on each node, is preferred due to its effortlessness.

In the second phase, we reclassified the assets using 2 -dimensional classification factors reflecting the business process, and applied weight to the first evaluation results.
