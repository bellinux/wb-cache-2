25|$|Verbs {{conjugate}} for 3 tenses: past, present, future; 2 voices: active, mediopassive, 3 persons: first, second, third; and 2 numbers, singular, and plural. Ukrainian verbs come <b>in</b> <b>aspect</b> pairs: perfective, and imperfective. Pairs {{are usually}} formed by a prepositional prefix and occasionally a root change. The past tense agrees with its subject {{in number and}} gender, having developed from the perfect participle.|$|E
25|$|In Chinese, A-not-A can {{be formed}} by a verb, an adjective, or an adverb. Modals can form A-not-A {{questions}} as well. A-not-A questions {{have a special}} interrogative type pattern in which all answers must be in “A” (affirmative form) or “not-A” (negative predicate form). In the interrogative clause, A-not-A occurs by repeating the first part in the verbal group (with the option of an auxiliary) and the negative form of the particle is placed in between. However, this clause does not apply when using perfective <b>in</b> <b>aspect.</b> Instead, meiyou is used to replace the repeated verb used in A-not-A form.|$|E

25|$|The books it {{encompassed}} {{were published}} in the Romanian lands during this period in Romanian, Slavonic, Greek and even Georgian, by both Romanians and foreigners; it also included books published abroad by Romanians. Publication began in 1903 (preceded by early drafts from 1898), took a nearly two-decade hiatus after Hodoș' death in 1913, and resumed once Simonescu joined the project in 1931. It was completed after Bianu's death, in 1944. Likened to George Călinescu's history of Romanian literature, although more historic <b>in</b> <b>aspect,</b> it was the country's most ample bibliography at the time, praised by Iorga for its completeness. It was however criticized by later bibliographers, and by Bianu himself, for being inconsistent and incomplete in its selection or presentation of titles.
