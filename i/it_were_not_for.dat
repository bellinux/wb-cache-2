5|$|Biofuels {{offer the}} {{prospect}} of real market competition and oil price moderation. According to the Wall Street Journal, crude oil would be trading 15 per cent higher and gasoline would {{be as much as}} 25 per cent more expensive, if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> biofuels. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rains and}} {{flooding}} {{are the primary}} problem associated with tropical cyclones across the Pelican State. Recent examples of flooding across the state from tropical cyclones include Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, Tropical Storm Frances in 1998, Tropical Storm Allison in 1989, and Tropical Storm Claudette in 1979. Three of the four systems stalled across eastern Texas, prolonging the rainfall which occurred over Louisiana. If <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> the intermittent invasions from tropical cyclones, rainfall during the months of August, September, and October would average about 25% less than it currently does.|$|E
5|$|The three {{families}} travel to a dude ranch in Wyoming. In the Pritchett family storyline, Gloria (Sofía Vergara) experiences hearing difficulty following the plane ride while a cowboy, Hank (Tim Blake Nelson), flirts with her. Gloria's husband, Jay (Ed O'Neill), takes notice, but Gloria is oblivious to his behavior. Later, Hank grabs Gloria's butt causing Jay {{to tell him}} to back off, which he does. He said if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> him being the bad guy Jay would not have been a hero, but Gloria fights back and says Jay is always a hero.|$|E

5|$|As the Bonneville Floods rushed {{down the}} Snake River, the Missoula Floods {{occurred}} in the same period, but farther north. The Missoula Floods, which took place more than 40 times in the time span from 15,000 to 13,000 years ago, were caused by Glacial Lake Missoula on the Clark Fork repeatedly being impounded by ice dams then breaking through, with the lake's water rushing over much of eastern Washington in massive surges far larger than the Lake Bonneville Flood. These floods pooled behind the Cascade Range into enormous lakes and spilled over the northern drainage divide of the Snake River watershed, carving deep canyons through the Palouse Hills. The Palouse River canyon was {{the largest of the}} many gorges cut through the Palouse Hills, and could not have become as large as it now is if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> the Missoula Floods. The Lake Bonneville Floods and the Missoula Floods helped widen and deepen the Columbia River Gorge, a giant water gap which allows water from the Columbia and Snake rivers to take a direct route through the Cascade Range to the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Development of D {{lasted about}} {{one year and}} was {{directed}} by WARP president Kenji Eno. Eno was heavily inspired by Polarware's Transylvania adventure game series and he believes D would have never been created if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> playing those games. Eno and WARP were still relatively unknown in the industry, D would be their first major title. With this in mind, Eno {{felt that he was}} gambling his development career on D, and if it were not successful he would stop developing games. There were three phases to Ds development: the adventure game structure, the story creation, and finally violence was added. Since the adventure gameplay was largely finished before the story began to take fruition, flashbacks were added to detail the plot. The plot was largely based on that of Dracula, but Eno found it too boring, and so added violence and cannibalism to make the game more striking. The FMVs were created using Amiga 4000s.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Castillo Armas {{had begun}} to intensify his aerial attacks, with the extra planes that Eisenhower had approved. They had limited {{material}} success; many of their bombs were surplus material from World War II, and failed to explode. Nonetheless, they had a significant psychological impact. On 25 June, {{the same day that}} he received the army's ultimatum, Árbenz learned that Castillo Armas had scored what later proved to be his only military victory, defeating the Guatemalan garrison at Chiquimula. Historian Piero Gleijeses has stated that if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> U.S. support for the rebellion, the officer corps of the Guatemalan army would have remained loyal to Árbenz because, although they were not uniformly his supporters, they were more wary of Castillo Armas, and also had strong nationalist views. As it was, they believed that the U.S. would intervene militarily, leading to a battle they could not win.|$|E

25|$|Proponents of the FMA {{initially}} {{argued that}} if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> judicial overreach, {{there would be}} no need for an FMA; states' rights would not be violated since no state legislatures had recognized same-sex marriage.

25|$|Cato {{is famous}} {{not only as}} statesman or soldier, but also as author.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the trailers being swept away by the torrent, many houses, with people still in or on top of them, were swept into Lake Ontario. Many people were saved when the houses in which they took shelter were stopped by trees from going into the lake. The reeve, Marie Curtis, {{was quoted in the}} Globe and Mail saying that if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> the trees, half of the village would have been swept into the lake. She also described a house with 35 people on its roof that was stopped by two trees from floating into the lake.|$|E

His brother John was captured and would have been sent to the West Indies as a slave if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> the intervention of the Duke of Hamilton.

As it is, Michigan's Chris Perry scored moments later and Iowa took a 106 lead into halftime. After a Michigan field goal pushed the score to 109, Iowa took over. The Hawkeyes scored 24 unanswered points to finish the game as Lewis and Jones racked up two touchdowns each. Quarterback Brad Banks threw for 222 {{yards and three touchdowns}} as Iowa handed Michigan their worst home loss since 1967.|$|E
25|$|Reuben Moore, Jr., likely began {{construction}} of Court Manor (then known as Mooreland Hall) {{during the last}} years of the eighteenth century, following his grandfather's death in 1797. Mooreland Hall would have been a rather conventional exercise in the late colonial style if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> the incorporation of the impressive Greek Revival portico into the design. Supported by four massive columns of the Doric order and surmounted by a simple triangular pediment decorated with a single semi-circular window, the scale of the portico dominates the main facade of the house. The large, two-level structure was constructed using bricks fired on site by the plantation's slaves. The house contained twelve spacious rooms, each with a fireplace and with large windows, affording panoramic views of the rolling countryside with the Massanutten Mountain Ridge rising in the distance.|$|E
25|$|By 1977, Roland and Normand {{were charged}} with assault and Claude and Adrien {{were charged with}} perjury for giving a false {{testimony}} to the Police Commission. Even earlier that year Jean-Paul received a year’s sentence for possessing the proceeds of a $100,000 jewelry theft and as well was charged with perjury and contempt by the commission, leaving five of the brothers behind bars. On April 27, 1977, Jean-Guy {{was found guilty of}} the 2nd degree murder of Jean-Guy Fournier. It was not until November 12, 1982 that Claude Dubois who was considered one of the driving forces of the family’s crime empire was convicted of the 1973 murder of Cotroni’s brother-in-law and was locked away for 25 years basically resulting in the fall of the Dubois Brothers. By the mid 1980s the Brothers had lost their empire and were split up with some behind bars and some laying low.
