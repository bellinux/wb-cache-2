5000|$|Developed by Saxon-Motodd in Britain in {{the early}} 1980s, the Telelever fork aims to improve <b>handling</b> <b>stability</b> during {{cornering}} and braking. The Telelever uses conventional telescopic forks, but the stanchions contain only lubricating oil. Springing and damping functions are dealt with by a monoshock attached to a [...] "Telelever" [...] wishbone. The wishbone pivots {{on the front of}} the engine block, and the wishbone's forward end is attached via a rose-joint to a brace connecting the fork sliders. As there is no lower triple clamp, the fork sliders are longer and lighter than on a conventional telescopic fork, and the greater slider/tube overlap reduces both torsional flex and unsprung weight.|$|E
5000|$|Firecrest {{technology}} was developed from Zipp’s earlier “toroidal” rim shapes. These were designed with a bulge {{in the rim}} cross-section to reduce turbulence behind the tire {{at the leading edge}} of the wheel. Firecrest essentially inverts this shape, placing {{the leading edge of the}} airfoil along the interior of the rim (towards the hub). As a result, Zipp claims that Firecrest rims show improved aerodynamic performance at all points around the wheel, combined with improved stability in crosswinds. A product review on the Cyclingnews website reported, “the Firecrest aero profile is noticeably fast at cruising speed” and that a Firecrest wheelset “offers <b>handling</b> <b>stability</b> in crosswinds unmatched by other aero wheels we've used.” ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{yaw moment}} {{controller}} of which parameters {{are dependent on}} the vehicle forward velocity is designed for improving vehicle <b>handling</b> and <b>stability.</b> Robustness of the controller is enhanced with considering the parameter uncertainties arising from tyre cornering stiffness and the actuator saturation limitations resulting from some physical constraints and tyre–road conditions into the controller design process. The design of the controller is achieved by solving finite numbers of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Effectiveness of the designed controller is shown through numerical simulations performed on a nonlinear vehicle model. Improved performance on vehicle <b>handling</b> and <b>stability</b> can be observed from the sideslip angle and yaw rate responses under a J-turn manoeuvre with different vehicle forward velocities, road conditions, and actuator saturation limitations...|$|R
50|$|Unlike the R8R, {{which was}} able to {{complete}} a full testing program, the R8C was completed late and had very little test time prior to the 24 Hours of Le Mans group test in May. Consequently, the cars suffered numerous setbacks and lacked pace both compared to the R8Rs and overall. The R8Cs were capable of hitting speeds upward of 350 km/h on the Mulsanne Straight, but they lacked <b>handling</b> <b>stability</b> compared to other cars and hence lacked overall speed across a full lap. While the R8Rs managed the 8th and 11th fastest times, the R8Cs could only manage the 22nd and 28th fastest times. Many of the R8Cs' problems stemmed from aerodynamic instability, which, besides creating handling difficulties, was causing a build-up of air underneath the engine cover. This issue caused the R8Cs to lose their rear engine covers on several occasions while at speed.|$|E
50|$|Sled Storm {{offers two}} forms of racing for both multi-player and solo competition: Championship and Quick Race. Quick Race allows you to jump right into the game {{on any of the}} {{available}} courses unlocked during the Championship Mode. Players can choose their alter ego from a pool of characters, each with his or her own sled rated in five areas: top speed, acceleration, <b>handling,</b> <b>stability</b> and tricks. Once a player has found the appropriate character, he or she can set the number of laps (from two to nine), time of the race (day or night) and even the weather conditions (clear, snow or rain). Championship Mode involves competing in a series of races that can earn you money as well as open up additional tracks and hidden characters. Two types of championship racing are awaiting you: Open Mountain and the Super SnoCross. The Open Mountain Championship involves straightforward racing down alpine terrain as you try to finish first to receive a cash prize (which can then be used to purchase upgrades in such areas as treads, skis, brakes and spotlights). The Super SnoCross involves racing strictly for points as you string together tricks off the motocross-inspired courses. Earn enough points and you'll be able to unlock additional characters to play as.|$|E
40|$|Handling {{instability}} is {{a serious}} threat to driving safety. In order to analyze the <b>handling</b> <b>stability</b> of a tractor semitrailer, a handling diagram can be used. In our research, considering the impact of multiple nonsteering rear axles and nonlinear characteristics of tires on vehicle <b>handling</b> <b>stability,</b> the handling equations are developed for description of stability of tractor semi-trailer. Then we obtain handling diagrams so as to study the influence of driving speed, loaded mass, and fifth wheel lead on vehicle <b>handling</b> <b>stability.</b> The analysis results show that the <b>handling</b> <b>stability</b> of a tractor semi-trailer when the tractor has two nonsteering rear axles is better than that when the tractor has only one nonsteering rear axle. While the stability in the former case is slightly influenced by driving speed and loaded mass, the latter is strongly influenced by both. The fifth wheel lead is found to only slightly influence <b>handling</b> <b>stability</b> for both tractor semi-trailers. Therefore, to ensure the driving safety of tractor semi-trailers when the tractor has only one nonsteering rear axle, much stricter restraints should be imposed on driving speed, and the loaded mass must not exceed the rated load of the trailer...|$|E
