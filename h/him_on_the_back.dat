5|$|The {{next night}} on Raw, Orton faced Batista, {{who had become}} World Heavyweight Champion. Orton stated {{on-screen}} that his match with The Undertaker had aggravated a shoulder injury. While sidelined, Orton appeared on Raw and claimed that he was ineligible for the WWE Draft Lottery due to his injury. He was informed by WWE Chairman Vince McMahon that he was indeed {{a candidate for the}} draft, leaving a possibility of a return to SmackDown!. Orton returned to WWE programming for SmackDown! on June 16, announcing that he was the second pick in the 2005 draft lottery. He rekindled his feud with The Undertaker, defeating him at SummerSlam following a distraction from his father. Two months later, Orton and his father Bob Orton defeated The Undertaker in a Handicap Casket match, after the match Randy Orton and his father Bob locked the Undertaker in the casket and, in a move similar to Kane at the 1998 Royal Rumble, chopped holes {{in the top of the}} casket with an axe, poured gasoline over the casket and set it ablaze, kayfabe killing The Undertaker. The following month, Orton replaced the late Eddie Guerrero as a participant in the annual elimination match of Team SmackDown against Team Raw at Survivor Series, after having lost a qualifying match to Rey Mysterio. In the match, Orton was the last remaining wrestler in the match for the third straight year, as he pinned Shawn Michaels to get the victory for Team SmackDown. At the event, The Undertaker returned by emerging from a flaming casket and attacked the SmackDown superstars who came to the ring to celebrate Team SmackDown's victory. On the SmackDown! episode after Survivor Series, The Undertaker interfered in a match between Rey Mysterio and Big Show after Kane interfered. Randy Orton RKO'd the Undertaker, he then struck the Undertaker with a tire iron and set <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the lowrider Mysterio had driven to the ring, he then reversed the lowrider into the SmackDown set, causing an explosion. The feud was finally settled with a Hell in a Cell match at Armageddon, where The Undertaker offered to retire if he lost. On December 16, The Undertaker entered the ring to deliver a promo while one of his druids appeared to be standing in the ring. The Undertaker sustained an RKO from Orton in a surprise attack. The druid revealed himself to be Orton's father, who gave Orton The Undertaker's urn, which, according to the storyline, allowed whomever held it to control The Undertaker. The Undertaker, however, beat both Ortons in a Hell in a Cell match, ending their nine-month-long feud.|$|E
25|$|Two brothers, Ronald and Lance Madison, {{fled the}} scene, but were pursued down the bridge by Gisevius and Faulcon in an unmarked state police vehicle. Faulcon fired his shotgun {{from the back}} of the car at Ronald, a developmentally {{disabled}} man who would later die from his injuries. The autopsy found that Ronald Madison sustained seven gunshot wounds, five of them in his back. Bowen was later convicted of stomping <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> before he died, though this conviction was overturned for lack of physical evidence. Lance Madison was then taken into custody and charged with eight counts of attempting to kill police officers. He was held in custody for three weeks before being released without indictment.|$|E

500|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} that William Elliot, a young baronet, called to visit a [...] "great lady" [...] at the house in Grosvenor Square in which the Pig-faced Lady {{was believed to be}} staying. Taken into the drawing room, he was confronted by a fashionably dressed woman with the face of a pig. Elliot [...] "could not refrain from uttering a shout of horror, and rushed to the door in a manner the reverse of polite". The Pig-faced Lady rushed at Elliot as he left and bit <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the neck; it was claimed that he was badly injured in the attack, requiring treatment by eminent surgeon Sir Cæsar Hawkins. A popular print entitled Beware the pig-sty! depicted the supposed attack on Elliot.|$|E
500|$|It was {{intended}} that Yardley would appear lower {{down in the}} batting order, batting with a substantial total accumulated by the previous batsmen. However, the frailties of the England batting meant he often appeared in a crisis and had to rebuild several innings. Bill Bowes, the Yorkshire and England bowler who covered the tour as a journalist, was impressed by Yardley's approach, noting {{that he did not}} back away from the fast bowlers, who frequently bowled bouncers at him: [...] "In fact, Yardley played cricket with a determination we had never seen in Yorkshire or in his days at the university." [...] He made the greatest impression as a bowler, surprising commentators with his effectiveness. He did not bowl in the first six matches, but in his first over of the tour dismissed Arthur Morris who had already scored a century. From that point, he was used effectively to break up partnerships. In the Tests, he removed Donald Bradman in three successive innings, while in the third Test, he took two wickets, including Bradman, in two deliveries. Bowes believed the natural length of Yardley's bowling was perfect for Australian pitches—he was not skilful enough to alter the length at which he bowled so his bowling in other conditions was less effective. The Australian reporter Clif Cary wrote [...] "It was always amusing to watch the Englishmen when Yardley took a wicket. The first time they seemed fairly amused, but when he was regularly breaking partnerships, their enthusiasm knew no bounds, and it is said that in Melbourne after he had obtained Bradman's wicket for the third time, Yardley blushed profusely when one excited team-mate slapped <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and shouted [...] "Well, bowled, Spofforth".|$|E
500|$|A {{teenager}} {{struggling to}} find his place in life ever since his parents disappeared {{when he was a}} child. A spider bites <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of his neck, giving him spider-powers. He becomes Spider-Man. Garfield described Parker as someone he can relate to and stated that the character had been an important influence on him since he was little. [...] Garfield drew from his life experiences as inspiration for the role, revealing, [...] "I was thinking of my history and thinking of the kid at school who I wasn't as strong as, who behaved badly to a lot of people– including myself– and who I constantly tried to stand up to but never had the physical prowess to". Discussing his predecessor, Garfield said he respects Tobey Maguire as an actor and that when he first saw Maguire play Spider-Man he [...] "was blown away by his interpretation." [...] Garfield said in interviews, including one in which he was interviewed by Maguire, that when he watched the film Spider-Man when he was younger, he would jokingly recite Maguire's lines in the mirror with a friend who joked that he would never be Spider-Man. On accepting the role Garfield explained, [...] "I see it as a massive challenge in many ways... To make it authentic. To make the character live and breathe in a new way. The audience already has a relationship with many different incarnations of the character. I do, as well. I'm probably going to be the guy in the movie theater shouting abuse at myself. But I have to let that go. No turning back. And I wouldn't want to." [...] After taking the role, Garfield studied the movements of athletes and spiders and tried to incorporate them, saying Parker is [...] "a boy/spider in terms of how he moves, and not just in the suit." [...] He did yoga and Pilates for the role in order to be as flexible as possible. When first wearing his costume Garfield admitted to shedding tears and trying to imagine [...] "a better actor in the suit", which he described as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] and admitted to wearing nothing beneath it since it is skintight. When filming Garfield explained that he had four months of training and described his physical roles on stunts as terribly challenging and exhausting.|$|E

2500|$|I don't think Bradman {{appreciated}} being {{dismissed by}} a man who was not considered anywhere approaching county class. It was always amusing to watch the Englishmen when Yardley took a wicket.

2500|$|A {{more cynical}} view, {{that sought to}} {{contrast}} illusion with changing times, was offered in 1934 by the composer and conductor Constant Lambert who [...] "conjure up the hideous faux bonhomie of the hiker, noisily wading {{his way through the}} petrol pumps of Metroland, singing obsolete sea chanties [...] with the aid of the Week-End Book, imbibing chemically flavoured synthetic beer under the impression that he is tossing off a tankard of 'jolly good ale and old' ... and astonishing the local garage proprietor by slapping <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and offering him a pint of 'four 'alf'".|$|E
2500|$|There was {{speculation}} that Swann would challenge Panesar for the Test place {{or at least}} play alongside <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of his strong performances {{in the first four}} ODIs. [...] However, Panesar was given a vote of confidence from the England Coach, Peter Moores, who called him [...] "(England's) number one Test spinner". In the event, England opted to play Panesar ahead of Swann in the three match series in December. In the first match at Kandy Panesar took 6/178, but in the second Test at Columbo and the third Test at Galle he only managed figures of 2/151 and 0/76 respectively. He finished the series with 8 wickets at an average of 50.63.|$|E

2500|$|Dorothy Caruso {{noted that}} her husband's health began a {{distinct}} downward spiral in late 1920 {{after he returned}} from a lengthy North American concert tour. In his biography, Enrico Caruso, Jr. points to an on-stage injury suffered by Caruso as the possible trigger of his fatal illness. A falling pillar in Samson and Delilah on 3 December had hit <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> over the left kidney (and not on the chest as popularly reported). A few days before a performance of Pagliacci at the Met (Pierre Key says it was 4 December, {{the day after the}} Samson and Delilah injury) he suffered a chill and developed a cough and a [...] "dull pain in his side". It appeared to be a severe episode of bronchitis. Caruso's physician, Philip Horowitz, who usually treated him for migraine headaches with a kind of primitive TENS unit, diagnosed [...] "intercostal neuralgia" [...] and pronounced him fit to appear on stage, although the pain continued to hinder his voice production and movements.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the flat, over-rolled batting tracks at {{the other}} venues the famous {{spinning}} wicket at the S.C.G. was expected to give a result and Bill Lawry announced [...] "This time {{there will be a}} result for sure". England replaced their out of form vice-captain Colin Cowdrey with his Kentish team-mate Derek Underwood to give them five specialist bowlers. Ken Shuttleworth was replaced by fast bowler Bob Willis, playing his first Test. The Australians announced their team before the One Day International had been played, too late to replace Alan Connolly who had been hit for 62 runs off eight overs in the knockabout game. The erratic fast-medium bowler Alan Thomson was replaced on the field by the spinner John Gleeson. Thomson was made twelfth man, but was so popular that drinks were served two overs late as he struggled though the crowd of people chatting to him and patting <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> [...] Ray Illingworth won the toss again and chosen to bat on a 'hot and hostile' pitch which looked like helping the seamers, but was predicted to take increasing turn.|$|E
2500|$|Kane and Matt Hardy faced {{one another}} in a [...] "Till Death Do Us Part" [...] match at SummerSlam, with Lita obliged to wed the victor. Kane {{defeated}} Hardy, and [...] "married" [...] Lita on the August 23 episode of Raw. Although he was attacked by Hardy during the ceremony, he gained the upper hand and ultimately chokeslammed Hardy off the stage (in reality, Hardy needed time off because of a knee injury and later a staph infection). [...] A week after the wedding, General Manager Eric Bischoff gave Kane and Lita the wedding gift of choosing any match that Kane wanted at Unforgiven. Shawn Michaels (who had his throat crushed by Kane) was chosen and defeated Kane in a no-disqualification match at the pay-per-view. The next night, on the September 13 episode of Raw, Kane accidentally fell on Lita during a match with the debuting Gene Snitsky, who hit <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> with a steel chair, ostensibly causing Lita to miscarry. Kane turned face after he sought revenge against Snitsky for causing the death of his child. He lost to Snitsky in a steel chain match at Taboo Tuesday, and he was sidelined for several months after Snitsky crushed his larynx with a chair following the match. This attack was a repeat performance of the storyline where Kane [...] "injured" [...] Michaels in the same exact manner. The [...] "injury" [...] gave Kane time to complete his starring role in the film, See No Evil. Kane returned in January 2005, defeating Snitsky at New Year's Revolution. After WrestleMania 21, Kane and Lita reconciled with one another and began antagonizing Lita's rival Trish Stratus. This led to a match between Kane and Stratus' hired bodyguard Viscera at Backlash that was won by Kane.|$|E

2500|$|India {{started the}} fourth room facing a {{daunting}} situation. Dravid and Ganguly gave India a quiet start, adding only 11 {{runs in the}} first five overs, but in the third ball of the fifteenth over, Ganguly received a blow {{on the back of the}} head from Brad Williams, and had to retire. At this point, Sachin Tendulkar came in, and along with Rahul Dravid, rescued India from doldrums. India were 109/2 at lunch, as the two batsmen applied themselves on a wearing pitch with uneven bounce. After lunch, Tendulkar began confidently, playing some good shots off Brett Lee and Brad Williams, before getting out to Williams, attempting to play a wide delivery from him. He had, by then, made his highest score in the series, 44, and a poor year personally in terms of form for him, ended. His knock was described as being [...] "diligent in protecting(his)wicket and resisting temptation". Then the score was 126/3. From that point onwards, Australia executed their tactics well enough and did not employ over-attacking fields for VVS Laxman, the next batsman, knowing that he could score his runs freely anyhow. Laxman, in spite of being untroubled during his brief stay in the crease, got out to Stuart MacGill, getting drawn into edging a leg-break to slips. The score was 160/4 and India were still trailing by 32 runs. Ganguly came in after Laxman's dismissal, while Dravid was unbeaten at the other end on 53. The Dravid-Ganguly partnership resumed quietly, starting with a succession of three maiden overs within five overs. Ganguly, in particular, continued with his defensive style of play till tea. Just after the break, Australia played Simon Katich an Stuart MacGill, and the runs continue to flow freely. The second new ball was [...] taken after eighty overs, and by then Ganguly's strokeplay had become bolder. He reached his half-century against Brett Lee's bowling with a drive to mid-off. He reached his fifty from 106 balls with eight fours. After securing applause for his fifty, he sent the next ball racing past point for four. Against Brad Williams in the next over, Ganguly swung high over square leg for four against a short delivery, like the one which had hit <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of his head. Lee came steaming in the next over as well, but again, he was dispatched for four off successive balls. It was [...] "stirring stuff, not without an element of risk in it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{ball was}} a leg bye to bring Rick McCosker on strike and he glance the ball off his legs {{to bring up}} his first Test runs to the applause of the 52,164 strong crowd. He made 80 on debut and added 96 with Redpath as the England fast bowlers missed their chance with the new ball and the pitch proved to be truer than expected. McCosker edged a ball that fell short of Alan Knott, slashed another that was missed by Edrich in the gully and Redpath nearly ran himself out off a no-ball (photographs later showed {{that he should have}} been out). The England captain set {{defensive}} fields from the outset, with a third and fine leg and only three close fielders and Australia were in little trouble. Redpath was hit on the hand by Bob Willis and finally out when he trod on his stumps off Titmus for 33, but McCosker made 80 when he was disturbed by the rumpus from the Sydney Hill. Fans were throwing beer cans at Tony Greig, one hitting <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> and Umpire Brooks had to intervene to calm them down and have the field cleared of rubbish before play could resume. McCosker's concentration was disturbed and he was caught by Knott off Greig (4/104) Ian Chappell was almost run out by David Lloyd for a duck, but made 53 before he was caught by Knott off Geoff Arnold (5/86). Ross Edwards came out at 199/3 to the disappointment of his local fans, who wanted their hero Doug Walters to come out and score a century as he had at Perth and had erected the famous [...] "Doug Walters Stand" [...] banner on the Hill. Edwards made only 15 in a stand of 52 with Greg Chappell when he played over a yorker from Greig two balls short of stumps and play was ended early at 251/4. This soon became 255/5 when Arnold took the new ball and nipped it back to catch Walters lbw, but Chappell and Marsh added 50 runs in 56 minutes. They were removed by the ever-combative Grieg, who removed Marsh's middle stump with a yorker and caught Chappell off Arnold when he looked set for a hundred to leave them 310/7. The Australian lower order made runs quickly enough despite being repeatedly bounced by Arnold and Grieg, who hit Lillee on the elbow and bruised Ashley Mallett's bowling hand. Fletcher told Lillee that he had been asking for bouncers the way he bowled and the fast bowler's reply made him complain to Umpire Brooks about his use of language. Two bouncers in one over resulted in Greig being warned for intimatory bowling, who asked if Lillee was restricted to one bouncer per over to him as well. Brooks saying that as Lillee was a tailender and Greig was a batsman the same standard did not apply. In the end Arnold dismissed Lillee and Walker, but Thomson hit 24 not out off 23 balls before Mallet was lbw to Grieg with the score on 405.|$|E
