5|$|In 2001, annual {{membership}} dues were stated to be $9,000 per {{member or}} $12,000 for a family, {{with an initial}} deposit of $250,000. Before the 2008 recession, initiation fees were $100,000 to $150,000. As of late 2015, initiation fees were down to $50,000. Around that time, many new members were reportedly not charged an <b>initiation</b> <b>fee</b> or were no longer required by the club to fully pay it within five years. Annual dues were $19,400 a year.|$|E

25|$|Today, only 51% of the Deerwood {{residents}} {{are members of}} the Country Club. Part of that is financial; the equity <b>initiation</b> <b>fee</b> was $21,000 in 2005, with monthly dues of $349 for a golf membership. However, there are about 100 non-residents who are Deerwood Country Club members. When the Deerwood Board of Governors made the decision to build a new clubhouse and renovate the golf course at a cost estimated at $9.5 million, all Equity members were assessed a fee to pay for it. Membership dropped from 700 in 2000 to approximately 500 in January 2004, when the project began. Approximately 25% of the members did not pay it, leaving the club with a $6M debt.|$|E

25|$|John Wise, a local Alexandria {{businessman}} and hotel keeper, hosted {{a meeting in}} his home in 1789 to discuss {{the creation of a}} Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge. Members include Rev. James Muir, physician Elisha Cullen Dick, and George Washington's personal attorney Charles Lee. The Society did not last for long. However, on July 24, 1794, the founders of the Society once again met at Wise's home to establish a subscription library. During the first year, one hundred nineteen men joined the circulating library which was to be called the Library Company of Alexandria. Members agreed to pay an <b>initiation</b> <b>fee</b> and annual dues. The company was chartered as a corporation in 1798 in an act passed by the General Assembly of Virginia.|$|E
2500|$|In unionised organizations, the [...] "initiation" [...] is {{typically}} {{no more than}} a brief familiarization with basic procedures and the provision of a copy of the appropriate collective bargaining agreement that governs the work performed by members of the union.

60|$|It {{was then}} that the long {{correspondence}} began. A letter came back, by order of the President, furnishing me {{the names of the}} members-thirty-two in number. With it came a copy of the Constitution and By-Laws, in pamphlet form, and artistically printed. The <b>initiation</b> <b>fee</b> and dues were in their proper place; also, schedule of meetings--monthly--for essays upon works of mine, followed by discussions; quarterly for business and a supper, without essays, but with after-supper speeches; also there was a list of the officers: President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, etc. The letter was brief, but it was pleasant reading, for it told me about the strong interest which the membership took in their new venture, etc., etc. It also asked me for a photograph --a special one. I went down and sat for it and sent it--with a letter, of course.|$|E

6000|$|In Zenith {{it was as}} {{necessary}} for a Successful Man {{to belong to a}} country club as it was to wear a linen collar. Babbitt's was the Outing Golf and Country Club, a pleasant gray-shingled building with a broad porch, on a daisy-starred cliff above Lake Kennepoose. There was another, the Tonawanda Country Club, to which belonged Charles McKelvey, Horace Updike, and the other rich men who lunched not at the Athletic but at the Union Club. Babbitt explained with frequency, [...] "You couldn't hire me to join the Tonawanda, even if I did have a hundred and eighty bucks to throw away on the <b>initiation</b> <b>fee.</b> At the Outing we've got a bunch of real human fellows, and the finest lot of little women in town--just as good at joshing as the men--but at the Tonawanda there's nothing but these would-be's in New York get-ups, drinking tea! Too much dog altogether. Why, I wouldn't join the Tonawanda even if they--I wouldn't join it on a bet!" ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was weeping}} and wailing and gnashing of {{teeth in the}} camp of the outsiders now. But no matter, there was but one course for them to pursue, and they pursued it. They came forward in couples and groups, and proffered their twelve dollars and asked for membership. They were {{surprised}} to learn that several new by-laws had been long ago added. For instance, the <b>initiation</b> <b>fee</b> had been raised to fifty dollars; that sum must be tendered, and also ten per cent. of the wages which the applicant had received each and every month since the founding of the association. In many cases this amounted to three or four hundred dollars. Still, the association would not entertain the application until the money was present. Even then a single adverse vote killed the application. Every member had to vote 'Yes' or 'No' in person and before witnesses; so it took weeks to decide a candidacy, because many pilots were so long absent on voyages. However, the repentant sinners scraped their savings together, and one by one, by our tedious voting process, they were added to the fold. A time came, at last, when only about ten remained outside. They said they would starve before they would apply. They remained idle a long while, because of course nobody could venture to employ them.|$|E
60|$|Very well, {{this growing}} swarm of new pilots {{presently}} began {{to undermine the}} wages, {{in order to get}} berths. Too late--apparently--the knights of the tiller perceived their mistake. Plainly, something had to be done, and quickly; but what was to be the needful thing. A close organization. Nothing else would answer. To compass this seemed an impossibility; so it was talked, and talked, and then dropped. It was too likely to ruin whoever ventured to move in the matter. But at last about a dozen of the boldest--and some of them the best--pilots on the river launched themselves into the enterprise and took all the chances. They got a special charter from the legislature, with large powers, under the name of the Pilots' Benevolent Association; elected their officers, completed their organization, contributed capital, put 'association' wages up to two hundred and fifty dollars at once--and then retired to their homes, for they were promptly discharged from employment. But there were two or three unnoticed trifles in their by-laws which had the seeds of propagation in them. For instance, all idle members of the association, in good standing, were entitled to a pension of twenty-five dollars per month. This began to bring in one straggler after another from the ranks of the new-fledged pilots, in the dull (summer) season. Better have twenty-five dollars than starve; the <b>initiation</b> <b>fee</b> was only twelve dollars, and no dues required from the unemployed.|$|E
50|$|An Executive {{committee}} and a Publications committee were appointed, and members {{were invited to}} pay their <b>initiation</b> <b>fees</b> before leaving for home.

50|$|When the Hollywood Athletic Club {{was first}} built in 1924, Hollywood was {{entering}} its greatest and most productive period.

6000|$|All {{the club}} united in abusing the dinner, which in his rustic ignorance Bartley had not found so infamous; but they ate it with perfect {{appetite}} and with mounting good spirits. The president brewed punch {{in a great}} bowl before him, and, rising {{with a glass of}} it in his hand, opened a free parliament of speaking, story-telling, and singing. Whoever recollected a song or a story that he liked, called upon the owner of it to sing it or tell it; and it appeared not to matter how old the fun or the music was: the company was resolved to be happy; it roared and clapped till the glasses rang. [...] "You will like this song," [...] Bartley's neighbors to right and left of him prophesied; or, [...] "Just listen to this story of Mason's,--it's capital,"--as one or another rose in response to a general clamor. When they went back to the reception-room they carried the punch-bowl with them, and there, amid a thick cloud of smoke, two clever amateurs took their places at the piano, and sang and played to their heart's content, while the rest, glass in hand, talked and laughed, or listened as they chose. Bartley had not been called upon, but he was burning to try that song in which he had failed so dismally in the logging-camp. When the pianist rose at last, he slipped down into the chair, and, striking the chords of the accompaniment, he gave his piece with brilliant audacity. The room silenced itself and then burst into a roar of applause, and cries of [...] "Encore!" [...] There could be no doubt of the success. [...] "Look here, Ricker," [...] said a leading man {{at the end of the}} repetition, [...] "your friend must be one of us!"--and, rapping on the table, he proposed Bartley's name. In that simple time the club voted viva voce on proposed members, and Bartley found himself elected by acclamation, and in the act of paying over his <b>initiation</b> <b>fee</b> to the treasurer, before he had well realized the honor done him. Everybody near him shook his hand, and offered to be of service to him. Much of this cordiality was merely collective good feeling; something of it might be justly attributed to the punch; but the greater part was honest. In this civilization of ours, grotesque and unequal and imperfect as it is in many things, we are bound together in a brotherly sympathy unknown to any other. We new men have all had our hard rubs, but we do not so much remember them in soreness or resentment as in the wish to help forward any other who is presently feeling them. If he will but help himself too, a hundred hands are stretched out to him.|$|E

25|$|An area Farnsworth tried but {{ultimately}} failed to develop was {{the recruitment of}} women. His desire was for {{a branch of the}} Klan to stem the growth of Catholics in public education and strengthen moralistic teachings in the home. For him women were the answer. Mrs. Gertrude Witham was promoted to Major Kleagle of the Maine Women of the KKK. However Farnsworth and Witham failed in effectively recruiting new women members. It also became apparent as timed passed that some of the female Klan were foreign-born (i.e. Canadian). This resulted in the dismissal of these women and their suing of the Klan to recover their <b>initiation</b> <b>fees</b> and dues. On top of this Farnsworth continued to charge $10 for <b>initiation</b> <b>fees</b> instead of the agreed-upon fee by the national women’s organization of $5. These efforts outside of the guidelines of the national Klan, along with other perceived misconduct, would eventually lead to Farnsworth’s resignation as King Kleagle of Maine.|$|R
50|$|The Great Depression was a {{difficult}} time for everyone, including the “rich man’s club.” At one point in 1933, our financial situation became so desperate that the Board decided to entirely waive <b>initiation</b> <b>fees</b> for 90 days, in hopes of encouraging people to join and pay monthly dues. In 1936 the Directors authorized the purchase of two slot machines. This controversial idea helped restore the Club to fiscal health.|$|R
