50|$|The {{cells are}} filled by {{evacuating}} the vane cell feed system. By applying a vacuum via a vacuum pump, the filling products are gently drawn {{out of the}} hopper into the feed system as soon as an evacuated cell moves underneath the hopper. The vacuum pump is protected by an integrated water separator. The level of vacuum can be set according to the filling product.In addition to the feed effect, the <b>filling</b> <b>product</b> is simultaneously evacuated {{to a certain extent}} (approx. 2-4 %). This means that the air content of the <b>filling</b> <b>product</b> decreases and the <b>filling</b> <b>product</b> becomes denser.|$|E
5000|$|Hopper vacuum systems: The {{additional}} {{creation of}} a hopper vacuum is {{a variation of the}} vacuum filler concept. The vacuum system is enhanced with an additional vacuum pump, specially designed for the hopper. The hopper is closed and is connected to an upstream reservoir. The vacuum present in the hopper allows <b>filling</b> <b>product</b> to be drawn into the filling machine from the reservoir. The <b>filling</b> <b>product</b> is also intensively evacuated.|$|E

5000|$|Screw {{feed system}} with feed augers: With a screw feed system, two {{counter-rotating}} screws form cells within a housing; they are {{moved in the}} direction of the pump when the screws are rotated. The <b>filling</b> <b>product</b> is again moved into the screw feed system with the aid of a vacuum and mechanical feeding devices.|$|E
5000|$|Clippers: Clippers for the {{production}} of portioned sausages are used in conjunction with vacuum fillers. The <b>filling</b> <b>product</b> is taken from the vacuum filler and through a filling pipe connected to the clipper and an appropriate sausage casing brake, where it is portioned into appropriate casings. The portion is then sealed by the clipper with the aid of metal clips. Sometimes, loops for hanging the portions are also attached simultaneously. Strings of sausages as well as individual portions can be produced.|$|E
5000|$|Forming devices: Forming {{devices are}} used for the {{production}} of formed products, such as dumplings and burgers. There are two types. With free-forming devices, the <b>filling</b> <b>product</b> is filled via tubing with an attached separating device. The separating device and the portion output are synchronised {{in such a way that}} it is possible to form the filling flow. The separating devices can be diaphragms (which function in a similar way to a photographic iris diaphragm; opening and closing creates a round shape during portioning), forming blades that move against each other or simple wire cutters or blades. The portion is ejected when the separating unit is opened. The separating devices then close in synchronisation with the end of the portion. This synchronised, adjustable process allows various different shapes to be created. The products can be directly transported for packaging or for thermal treatment on conveyor belts. With devices with forming dies, the <b>filling</b> <b>product</b> is filled into forming dies (plastic mould that is filled to the base). The filled mould is “moved” away from the filling area, it is detached from the flow of product by means of a simultaneous clipping movement and then ejected mechanically or pneumatically into transportation containers or into thermal treatment media.|$|E
50|$|The {{pumpability}} of viscous or pasty products has a key {{effect on}} the reliable function of a vacuum filler. <b>Filling</b> <b>products</b> in the food sector can be characterised {{with the aid of}} various different properties related to their pumpability (“fillability”). They are either physical characteristics that can be measured directly or they are sensory attributes.|$|R
5000|$|Co-extrusion systems: Co-extrusion {{means the}} {{synchronous}} feeding {{of two or}} more product flows with the aim of producing <b>filled</b> <b>products</b> (e.g. meatballs with ketchup filling, sausages with mustard filling and potato dumplings with a meat filling). Two or more vacuum fillers are always required. Co-extrusion systems are available for the forming, clipping and linking applications.|$|R
50|$|There are non-gelatin pudding and pie <b>filling</b> <b>{{products}}</b> {{sold under}} the Jell-O brand. Pudding is cooked {{on the stove}} top with milk, then eaten warm or chilled until firmly set. Jell-O has an instant pudding product which is mixed with cold milk and chilled. To make pie fillings, the same products are prepared with less liquid.|$|R
5000|$|Inline {{grinding}} systems: In {{the meat}} processing industry, grinding systems {{are used for}} grinding meat and {{are to be found}} ahead of the filling process in the product preparation phase. With inline grinding systems, a grinding system is integrated into the vacuum filler’s filling flow as an auxiliary device. The filling and grinding process steps can therefore be combined in a single machine. This means that the <b>filling</b> <b>product</b> is moved by the vacuum filler and, during filling, it is chopped to the final grain size within the grinding system. An important application for inline grinding systems is dry sausage or fresh sausage production.|$|E
5000|$|Viscosity: Viscosity is {{a measure}} of the {{consistency}} of a fluid. The higher the viscosity, the higher the consistency of the fluid is (it is less fluid); the lower the viscosity, the lower the consistency of it is (more fluid). Highly-viscous filling products in the food processing industry are primarily found in the meat, bakery products and convenience food sectors. These highly-viscous substances are commonly referred to as being “pasty”. The fluidity is the basic requirement for the pumpability of a fluid. The viscosity can also be determined using suitable rheological measuring apparatus. In the food sector, the viscosity is primarily dependent on the fluid content of the <b>filling</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E
50|$|The term feeding in {{the context}} of vacuum fillers refers to {{actively}} moving the filling media {{in the direction of the}} lower part of the hopper to support the vacuum approach within the hopper. Feeding is achieved by using moveable feeding augers with scrapers/rigid counter arms. The feeding auger is driven in synchronisation with the rotation of the rotors. Due to the special geometry of both augers and the parallel rotation movement, the <b>filling</b> <b>product</b> is moved vertically in the direction of the vane cell feed system. The required feed intensity depends on the viscosity of the media to be filled. Less active feed is needed with low-viscosity media than with high-viscosity product. There are therefore a variety of combinations or versions of the parts involved in the feeding process.|$|E

50|$|The vane cell {{feed system}} mainly {{consists}} of a rigid pump housing with attached side plate that is fixed to the pivoting hopper, and a removable rotor with pump vanes and cam. Depending on the machine size there are various different sizes of vane cell feed systems with parts with appropriate dimensions. The hopper can be swivelled to clean and dismantle surfaces and parts that {{come into contact with}} <b>filling</b> <b>product.</b> The driven rotor with an appropriate number of slots is located in the pump housing, in which pump vanes form cells with defined volumes when the machine is closed, supported by the cam. Induced by the rotor movement when the machine is started, the cells move {{in the direction of the}} vane cell feed system outlet and therefore ensure that a defined product flow is achieved. The weight accuracy of a feed system is partially dependent upon the production precision of the parts and their degree of wear.|$|E
50|$|The {{key element}} of a vacuum filler is the vacuum filling principle. The <b>filling</b> <b>product</b> is fed into the feed system {{mechanically}} via a hopper with actively driven feeding auger, as well as via vertical “vacuum suction”. Pre-evacuated cells of a vane cell feed system move underneath the hopper. The pressure difference relative to the ambient pressure (underpressure) caused by the evacuation ensures that the cells are filled with product. The feed system moves continuously, thus generating a continuous filling flow. The product is portioned by means of cyclic movements of the feed system. Each cell of the feed system has a particular volume. The portion {{is defined by the}} rotation distance of the rotor. The portioning volume is therefore set in the control system by multiplying the rotor’s rotation distance by the number of the feed system cells within it. The portion weight must be determined in the control system via the portion volume parameter with the aid of scales.|$|E
5000|$|ConPro systems: ConPro systems (continuous {{production}} systems) {{are special}} continuous co-extrusion systems for producing sausages with alginate skin. With this application, two vacuum fillers are operated in synchronisation and their filling flows {{are combined into}} one continuous product flow. Further down the process, the continuous string is divided into individual portions or strings of portions. One vacuum filler pumps the <b>filling</b> <b>product</b> while a second one deposits the skin (a paste containing alginate) via an annular gap. This is solidified {{by means of a}} fixing solution containing calcium ions. Depending on the degree of automation, the portions can be hung or collated or transported further for continuous thermal treatment or packaging. The most important advantage of the ConPro systems in comparison to traditional production methods is that sausage skins or casings no longer have to be changed. Due to continuous co-extrusion there are no casing change times and therefore the filling time is maximised.|$|E

40|$|Montana-Dakota Utilities (MDU) and Western Research Institute (WRI) {{have been}} {{developing}} flowable fill materials formulated using ash from the Montana-Dakota Utilities R. M. Heskett Station in Mandan, North Dakota. MDU and WRI have partnered with the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC) {{to further the}} development of these materials for lignite-fired fluidized-bed combustion (FBC) facilities. The MDU controlled density fill (CDF) appears to be a viable engineering material and environmentally safe. WRI is pursuing the commercialization of the technology under the trademark Ready-Fill{trademark}. The project objectives were to: (1) assess the market in the Bismarck-Mandan area; (2) evaluate the geotechnical properties and environmental compatibility; and (3) construct and monitor demonstrations of the various grades of flowable <b>fill</b> <b>products</b> in full-scale demonstrations. The scope of initial phase of work entailed the following: Task I [...] Assess Market for MDU Flowable Fill Products; Task II [...] Assess Geotechnical and Environmental Properties of MDU Flowable Fill Products; and Task III [...] Demonstrate and Monitor MDU Flowable <b>Fill</b> <b>Products</b> in Field-Scale Demonstrations. The results of these testing and demonstration activities proved the following: (1) The market assessment indicated that a market exists in the Bismarck-Mandan area for structural construction applications, such as sub-bases for residential and commercial businesses, and excavatable fill applications, such as gas line and utility trench filling. (2) The cost of the MDU flowable <b>fill</b> <b>product</b> must be lower than the current $ 35 -$ 45 /cubic yard price if it is to become a common construction material. Formulations using MDU ash and lower-cost sand alternatives offer that opportunity. An estimated market of 10, 000 cubic yards of MDU flowable <b>fill</b> <b>products</b> could be realized if prices could be made competitive. (3) The geotechnical properties of the MDU ash-based flowable fill can be modified {{to meet the needs of}} a range of applications from structural fill applications to excavatable applications, such as utility trench fill. (4) Environmental assessments using standard testing indicate that the environmental properties of the fill materials are compatible with numerous construction applications and do not pose a threat to either adjacent groundwater or soils. (5) WRI developed an Environmental Field Simulator (EFS) method for assessing the impact of flowable fill materials on adjacent soils and found that the zone of impact is less than a couple of inches, thereby posing no threat to adjacent soils. (6) Field-scale demonstrations of the MDU flowable fill were constructed and were successful for structural, as well as excavatable applications. Monitoring has demonstrated the geotechnical performance, environmental performance, and compatibility with common embed materials with the MDU flowable <b>fill</b> <b>products.</b> Technical and economic issues were identified that may hinder the commercial acceptance of MDU flowable fill materials, including: (1) the ability to produce a consistent product; (2) the ability to provide a product year round (cold weather retards strength development); and (3) the ability to evaluate and produce commercial quantities of MDU flowable fill using inexpensive materials...|$|R
30|$|Taking {{into account}} that the <b>filling</b> <b>product</b> used during past {{conservation}} works contained gypsum, the development of white crusts in the {{close proximity to the}} mortars patches was probably due to a lixiviation/recrystallization process. Lixiviation processes generally occur in the presence of high humidity levels, the atmospheric water {{is one of the most}} important factors that has contributed to the degradation process. Research has proved that the pH value of the rainwater in the Vesuvius region is strongly influenced by the dissolution of aerosols originating from maritime, continental and anthropogenic sources [51]. The abundant atmospheric acid pollutants (CO 2, NOx, SOx) can react with the mortars, causing partial dissolution of carbonate and sulphate based compounds (mainly of calcium). This dissolution process generates a water solution rich in Ca 2 +, HCO 3 − and SO 42 − ions with a more alkaline pH than the acid rain due to neutralization reactions that occurs. When this water evaporates, the gypsum reaches a saturation point and the salt precipitates on the obsidian surface or within its cracks.|$|E

40|$|Tetra Recart (TRC) is a {{multilayer}} laminate paperboard package used {{to package}} {{foods such as}} tomatoes, beans, vegetables and sauces. Some “aggressive” food products interact with {{the inside of the}} package material and make it difficult to guarantee the quality of the food during the whole shelf life of the product. Products with pH below 4 and Cl− content above 1 % are regarded as “aggressive” and are not packed in the TRC standard material. In this thesis work, a <b>fill</b> <b>product</b> mimicking aggressive food products has been developed. The goal was to obtain the same interaction patterns as given by aggressive food products, but eight times as fast, in order to use the <b>fill</b> <b>product</b> in accelerated storage tests in the development of new TRC materials. The work included the development of a model for corrosion development caused by aggressive products, the design of the <b>fill</b> <b>product,</b> packaging, and opening and evaluation of the packages. As well as evaluating the effects of different concentrations of acids, salts, fat and fatty acid together with an emulsifier, the influence of different storage temperatures on delamination of the inside polymer coating and corrosion of aluminium was evaluated. Delamination of the inside polymer was crucial for an accelerated development of corrosion of the aluminium foil. The presence of free fatty acids and an elevated storage temperature were necessary factors for delamination to occur. A high Cl− content seemed to be more important than a low pH in terms of aggressiveness of a product. The most well suited test product to use in accelerated storage tests of aggressive products in TRC had a pH of 2. 49 and a Cl− content of 7. 71 %. It was stored at 35 °C and contained 40 ppm free fatty acids. This product gave accelerated corrosion, and showed good compliance with the developed model for corrosion development. The composition of the test product is well outside the range for human food, i. e. the food package interactions described in this report would not occur to the same extent with products suitable for human consumption...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} mine {{backfill}} {{shows that in}} the past, considerable improvements in backfill-reliant mining technology were made when new fill systems were introduced. The present trend in mine backfill technology is towards the use of high-density fill systems. Tight filling and void reduction have also become essential requirements in engineering design of mines to ensure global stability. High-density fills have a low moisture content and are more competent products requiring less binder and time for stabilization, compared to conventional hydraulic backfill. Cemented rockfill and tailings/sand paste fills are two familiar high-density backfill systems in current use. In future {{there could be a}} high demand for low porosity high-density fills, as mines go deeper and ground stresses increase. This study was an original attempt to investigate the characteristics and property of high-density composite fill systems. Composite fills are made up of derivatives of waste rock, tailings, sand and metallurgical by-products. Composite fills represent the future direction of backfill technology. As mines go deeper, the ore could be processed underground and the waste rock and tailings combined together to form a low-porosity competent <b>fill</b> <b>product.</b> The application of composite fill systems will also increase the material available for backfilling, provide more flexibility in backfill mix design and produce competent fill systems for ground support.
