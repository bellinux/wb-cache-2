5|$|After {{spending}} {{the winter in}} the Mexican League, Hodge {{was named to the}} Oklahoma City 89ers as a player-coach for the 1973 season. After serving as a coach for Oklahoma City in 1974 and the San Jose Bees in 1975, Hodge was named manager of the San Jose team for the 1976 season. The Bees went 4595 that year, and Hodge was fired at season's end. In 1981, he was named manager of the Waterloo Indians. The team went 8155 in his first season, and he was named Manager of the Year for the Midwest League.

5|$|As NHL {{play was}} set to resume for the 2005–06season, Näslund became an {{unrestricted}} free agent. On the open market for several days, he re-signed with the Canucks <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> years on 3 August 2005, at $6million per season. Vancouver newspaper The Province reported that two other teams had offered deals that matched the contract he signed, but Näslund ultimately chose to remain with the Canucks because he felt the club had {{a better chance of}} winning the Stanley Cup. At the time, Näslund said he hoped to retire as a Canuck.|$|E
5|$|It intersects {{a number}} of city streets as it heads to the northeast, {{traversing}} several mixed-use blocks before crossing over Onondaga Creek, a north–south waterway that passes through most of Syracuse. On the northeast bank of the creek, NY175 turns east onto West Kennedy Street, a short connector between the creek and US11.

Pieces of the tail rotor struck the main rotor, and the aircraft rolled and crashed on its left side, burning ferociously. No rescue beepers were heard. The entire crew was listed as MIA and presumed killed: Capt. Peter Hayden Chapman II (pilot), Capt. John Henry Call III (co-pilot), TSgt. William Roy Pearson, TSgt. Allen J. Avery (para-rescuemen), TSgt. Roy D. Prater (Crew Chief), and Sgt. James Harold Alley (combat photographer).

5|$|Marble is {{the most}} {{significant}} mineral deposit of Romblon and {{is the most}} renowned product of the province. Based on statistics, Romblon is the second biggest provincial marble producer of the country next to Bulacan. Romblon marble is of very high quality and comes in shades of white, green, pink, red and black. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau has estimated that Romblon is endowed with about 150 million metric tons of marble. At current rates of extraction, the supply may last <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> centuries. Tablas Island is also believed to have vast reserves of marble.|$|E

5|$|The 1954 {{season was}} a {{transitional}} {{one for the}} Browns. Many of the players who joined the 1946 team had retired or were {{nearing the end of}} their careers. Graham, meanwhile, told Brown that he would retire after the season. After losing the first three games, Cleveland won eight in a row and earned another shot at the championship, again against the Lions. This time, the Browns won 56–10 as Graham ran for three touchdowns and passed <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>more.</b> He announced his retirement after the game.|$|E

5|$|The {{circumstances}} {{around the}} death of Michael Shishman are unclear. According to the Byzantine emperor and historian John Kantakouzenos the emperor was mortally wounded in the battle and soon died while another Byzantine historian suggests that Michael Shishman lived <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> days not able to gain consciousness and died on the fourth day. The Serbian chronicles state that his horse fell during the battle and crashed his body. When his body was taken to Dečanski, he mourned him but pointed out that he preferred war to peace. The early 15th-century Bulgarian scholar and cleric Gregory Tsamblak says that Michael Shishman was captured and killed by {{the son of the}} Serbian king, Stephen Dušan. He was buried in the Church of St George in Staro Nagoričane.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} demands {{of running a}} marathon every day took its toll on Fox's body. Apart from the rest days in Montreal taken {{at the request of}} the Cancer Society, he refused to take a day off, even on his 22nd birthday. He frequently suffered shin splints and an inflamed knee. He developed cysts on his stump and experienced dizzy spells. At one point, he suffered a soreness in his ankle that would not go away. Although he feared he had developed a stress fracture, he ran <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> days before seeking medical attention, and was then relieved to learn it was tendonitis and could be treated with painkillers. Fox rejected calls for him to seek regular medical checkups, and dismissed suggestions he was risking his future health.|$|E
5|$|The {{results were}} {{promising}} and John Larson was appointed Director of Leadership Development. He {{was charged with}} continuing support for the experiment. During 1969, Gene Rutherford of the Circle Ten Council along with the Course Directors from the pilot programs—Crawford, Stevens, Whisler and Carl Marlowe of the Hiawatha Councils—were charged with evaluating the project. They continued pilot-testing and experimenting with the program <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> years, through 1972. They also began developing an experimental junior leader training program that utilized the White Stag competencies.|$|E

5|$|The station {{served as}} the third station on the Montclair Branch, which was first {{electrified}} by technology created by Thomas Alva Edison in 1930. The overhead catenary wires were installed, making the line the first electrically run line on the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western alignment. The station remained in service for the Lackawanna Railroad <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> decades, when the railroad merged with the Erie Railroad on October 17, 1960. Although the now Erie-Lackawanna Railway continued to run the Montclair Branch, it reduced service, reducing the once two-rail alignment to one lone track, and removed most of the tracks at Lackawanna Terminal in Montclair. On April 1, 1976, the station {{was transferred to the}} Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) as the Erie-Lackawanna Railway was dissolved into the Conrail program.|$|E
5|$|Brimsek {{remained}} with the Bruins <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> seasons. He {{was named to}} the NHL Second All-Star team twice more and was selected to play in the inaugural NHL All-Star Game in 1947. The Bruins made the playoffs all three seasons but were eliminated in the semi-finals in all of them. Brimsek was also a finalist for the Hart Trophy in 1947–48, finishing behind Buddy O'Connor of the Rangers. Personal problems plagued Brimsek during his final years in Boston. His 10-month-old son had died in January 1949, and his coach and longtime teammate, Dit Clapper, had resigned from his coaching duties. It did not also help that the Boston crowd would occasionally boo Brimsek for his play. After the 1948–49 season, Brimsek requested a trade from Boston to Chicago in order to be closer to home, and to the new blueprint business he had started there. Boston granted his request and he was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks in exchange for cash. Brimsek only played one season with the Black Hawks, recording 22 wins, 38 losses and 10 ties in 70 games played. The team finished last in the standings. Brimsek's lone season with the Hawks was the only season where his team did not reach the playoffs. He retired {{at the conclusion of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of January 4, 1962, the three-car automated train began service, with a ceremony. The trains carried a stand-by motorman during the six-month trial period. The train had scheduled to begin service on December 15, 1961, but Quill threatened to strike all city- and private-owned transit in the city if the train ran. Under the new contract with the TWU, the NYCTA agreed to put a motorman in the train during the experimental period. While in its experimental period, the automated train was only operating during rush hours. In July, the test was extended <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> months, and in October the test was extended for six additional months. The chairman of the NYCTA, Charles Patterson, was disappointed by the automated shuttle train, doubting that the train could be operated without any transit personnel on board. Initially, the automation of the shuttle was expected to save $150,000 a year in labor costs; however, with one employee still required on the train, there would essentially be no savings. If the test succeeded, it was planned to automate the IRT Flushing Line, the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, and the Culver Shuttle. However, the NYCTA did not have plans to automate the whole system.|$|E

The {{timeline}} of the Dream arc has been reset, {{although it is}} now seen through the viewpoint of a crow Misuzu finds and names Sora. New things are revealed that were not seen following Yukito in the Dream arc. After Misuzu finds Sora and brings him back home, her condition worsens and eventually she forgets even who Haruko is. Misuzu's father, Keisuke Tachibana, shows up during this arc wanting to take Misuzu back to his home, but Haruko pleads with him to grant her more time, and they agree on extending the time <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> days. After the three days pass, Keisuke comes back and sees the love between Misuzu and Haruko; he decides to let them stay together. The remainder of this arc has Misuzu and Haruko spending time together like mother and daughter, culminating in Misuzu's death.|$|E
5|$|Leterrier and Roth were {{originally}} contracted to return. Leterrier also stated Norton was not signed on, but in October 2008, Hurd stated that Norton was contracted to reprise the role. The film had outgrossed its predecessor and Universal indicated {{interest in a}} sequel, though Leterrier believed a sequel would not be made because of the film's box office return. Feige said the film met Marvel's expectations and that Hulk would return, but after the crossover. Hurd was not concerned that a sequel may not be produced until at least 2012, citing the positive reception to the film and having produced the Terminator series, {{the second and third}} film of which had a 12-year gap. Tim Roth confirmed that Marvel had signed him <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> films. Leterrier, after having previously said {{he did not want to}} direct a sequel, said in late 2009 he had changed his mind and was now amenable.|$|E
5|$|The Germans swiftly mobilised {{to expel}} the Allied forces and {{launched}} heavy air assaults on Kos and Leros. Without fighter support, the islands' defence was soon precarious; the LRDG {{and the rest}} of the troops on Kalymnos were withdrawn to Leros on 4 October after the Germans won the Battle of Kos. German air assaults on Leros intensified during late October, and at dawn on 12 November 1943 the Germans attacked Leros by sea and air. During the ensuing Battle of Leros, the LRDG Rhodesians at Point 320, commanded by Rhodesian Captain JR Olivey, spiked their position's guns and withdrew before counter-attacking and retaking the point the next day. They held that position <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>more</b> days, during which they learned that the Germans were winning the battle. On 16 November, Olivey decided that holding the point any longer was pointless and ordered his men to split up, escape by any means possible and re-assemble in Cairo.
