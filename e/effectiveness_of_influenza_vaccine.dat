40|$|Abstract Background Though <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> are the {{cornerstone}} of medical interventions aimed at protecting individuals against epidemic influenza, their effectiveness in HIV infected individuals is not certain. With the recent detection <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> strains in countries with high HIV prevalence rates, we aimed at evaluating the current evidence on the efficacy and clinical <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> in HIV-infected individuals. Methods We used electronic databases to identify studies assessing efficacy or <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> in HIV patients. We included studies that compared the incidence of culture- or serologically-confirmed influenza or clinical influenza-like illness in vaccinated to unvaccinated HIV infected individuals. Characteristics of study participants were independently abstracted and the risk difference (RD), the number needed to vaccinate to prevent one case <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> (NNV) and the vaccine effectiveness (VE) computed. Results We identified six studies that assessed the incidence <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> in vaccinated HIV-infected subjects. Four of these studies compared the incidence in vaccinated versus unvaccinated subjects. These involved a total of 646 HIV-infected subjects. In all the 4 studies, the incidence <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> was lower in the vaccinated compared to unvaccinated subjects with RD ranging from - 0. 48 (95 % CI: - 0. 63, - 0. 34) to - 0. 15 (95 % CI: - 0. 25, 0. 05); {{between 3 and 7}} people would need to be vaccinated to prevent one case <b>of</b> <b>influenza.</b> <b>Vaccine</b> <b>effectiveness</b> ranged from 27 % to 78 %. A random effects model was used to obtain a summary RD of - 0. 27 (95 %CI: - 0. 42, - 0. 11). There was no evidence of publication bias. Conclusion Current evidence, though limited, suggests that <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> are moderately effective in reducing the incidence <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> in HIV-infected individuals. With the threat <b>of</b> a global <b>influenza</b> pandemic, there is an urgent need to evaluate the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> in trials with a larger number of representative HIV-infected persons. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{transmission}} of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) {{is very high}} among the Hajj congregation in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Despite recommendations for vaccinations, pilgrims remain at increased risk of RTIs. In this paper we systematically reviewed available studies assessing the uptake and effectiveness of vaccinations against RTIs among Hajj pilgrims and enumerated important demographic factors, if described, associated with vaccine uptake. Of the 42 included studies, 29 reported on the uptake and <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> among pilgrims, eight studies reported the uptake of other vaccines, notably pneumococcal, diphtheria and bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccines, and the remaining five studies described both influenza and non-influenza vaccines. The uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine ranged from 0. 7 % to 100 % across the study populations, with coverage highest in the elderly and those with pre-existing co-morbidities. The <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> was variable across studies but was significantly effective against laboratory-confirmed influenza (risk ratio 0. 56; 95 % CI 0. 41 – 0. 75; p < 0. 001) in pooled metadata from six studies. Uptake of diphtheria and pneumococcal vaccines was low, and the only study reporting pertussis among Hajj pilgrims found the presence of pre-Hajj immunity to be significantly protective against disease. Despite favourable evidence of effectiveness, our review shows variable uptake of vaccines across {{a number of studies}} with few data available on the uptake of non-influenza vaccines. Mixed-method studies are needed to gauge knowledge, attitudes and practices of Hajj pilgrims regarding vaccination, and randomized controlled trials are required to confirm the efficacy of vaccines and improve uptake in this vulnerable travelling population...|$|E

40|$|Background The {{application}} of test-negative design case-control studies {{to assess the}} <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> has increased substantially {{in the past few}} years. The validity of these studies is predicated on the assumption that confounding bias by risk factors is limited by design. We aimed to assess the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> in a high-risk group of elderly people. Methods We searched the Cochrane library, Medline, and Embase up to July 13, 2014, for test-negative design case-control studies that assessed the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine against laboratory confirmed influenza in community-dwelling people aged 60 years or older. We used generalised linear mixed models, adapted for test-negative design case-control studies, to estimate vaccine effectiveness according to vaccine match and epidemic conditions. Findings 35 test-negative design case-control studies with 53 datasets met inclusion criteria. Seasonal influenza vaccine was not significantly effective during local virus activity, irrespective of vaccine match or mismatch to the circulating viruses. Vaccination was significantly effective against laboratory confirmed influenza during sporadic activity (odds ratio [OR] 0 · 69, 95 % CI 0 · 48 – 0 · 99) only when the vaccine matched. Additionally, vaccination was significantly effective during regional (match: OR 0 · 42, 95 % CI 0 · 30 – 0 · 60; mismatch: OR 0 · 57, 95 % CI 0 · 41 – 0 · 79) and widespread (match: 0 · 54, 0 · 46 – 0 · 62; mismatch: OR 0 · 72, 95 % CI 0 · 60 – 0 · 85) outbreaks. Interpretation Our findings show that in elderly people, irrespective of vaccine match, seasonal influenza vaccination is effective against laboratory confirmed influenza during epidemic seasons.

Short-term studies may provide misleading pictures of long-term benefits, and residual confounding may have biased past results. This study examined the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> in seniors over the long term while addressing potential bias and residual confounding in the results.

Logistic regression was used to estimate the effectiveness of the vaccine for the prevention of hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza and death after adjustment for important covariates. Additional analyses explored for evidence of bias and the potential effect of residual confounding. Results There were 713, 872 person-seasons of observation. Most high-risk medical conditions that were measured were more prevalent among vaccinated than among unvaccinated persons. Vaccination was associated with a 27 % reduction in the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza (adjusted odds ratio, 0. 73; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 68 to 0. 77) and a 48 % reduction in the risk of death (adjusted odds ratio, 0. 52; 95 % CI, 0. 50 to 0. 55). Estimates were generally stable across age and risk subgroups. In the sensitivity analyses, we modeled the effect of a hypothetical unmeasured confounder that would have caused overestimation of vaccine effectiveness in the main analysis; vaccination was still associated with statistically significant - though lower - reductions in the risks of both hospitalization and death. Conclusions During 10 seasons, influenza vaccination was associated with significant reductions in the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza and in the risk of death among community-dwelling elderly persons.

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{assessed}} the benefits of extending influenza vaccination programmes, which are currently targeted primarily at those aged over 65 years, to those aged 50 - 64 years. We identified and reviewed all cost-effectiveness studies of influenza vaccination in those aged 50 - 64 years published before July 2008. While the studies suggest that vaccination in this age-group {{is likely to be}} cost effective, these results were dependent on several key assumptions. The estimates of serious outcomes due to influenza and the estimates of vaccine effectiveness (VE) against these outcomes were found to have the most influence on cost effectiveness. However, due to factors including mismatches between the measure of VE and the outcome under consideration, as well as various other data limitations, there is significant uncertainty around these key assumptions that was not well explored. There was a failure in some studies to report fundamental inputs such as discount rates. Overall, there was a general lack of transparency in the studies and, consequently, the conclusions around the cost <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> in those aged 50 - 64 years must be interpreted with caution. ...|$|E
40|$|Background. Current {{evidence}} supporting the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> in preventing hospitalizations in older adults is insufficient. Methods. During 3 influenza seasons, 2006 – 2009, community-dwelling adults aged> 50 y hospitalized with respiratory symptoms were prospectively enrolled in this study. We tested nose and throat samples for influenza virus by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction. We estimated vaccine effectiveness by comparing vaccination status between influenza-positive cases and influenza-negative controls using logistic regression models with propensity score adjustment. Results. Overall, 450 (59 %) of 763 eligible patients were enrolled; 417 (93 %) of enrolled patients had adequate respiratory samples, had known influenza vaccination status, and were community-dwelling. The proportions of influenza-positive patients were 8 %, 20 %, and 6 % in the 3 successive seasons. Of 39 influenza-positive participants, 14 (36 %) were vaccinated compared with 250 (66 %) of 378 influenza-negative controls. Propensity score–adjusted vaccine effectiveness for the 3 seasons combined was 61. 2 % (95 % confidence interval, 17. 5 %– 81. 8 %). Conclusion.

40|$|In the United States, annual {{vaccination}} against {{seasonal influenza}} {{is recommended for}} all persons aged ≥ 6 months (1).

40|$|Background: Estimates <b>of</b> the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{in older}} adults may be biased because of {{difficulties}} identifying and adjusting for confounders of the vaccine-outcome association.

40|$|In their {{meta-analysis}} of the efficacy and <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> licensed in the USA, Michael Osterholm and colleagues 1 stated that “evidence for protection in adults aged 65 {{years or older}} is lacking”, although chronic disorders such as cardiac and pulmonary diseases could require influenza vaccination. The cost-effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> vaccination policy requires consideration of adverse effects such as autoimmune disorders, which are rarely reported. Possible reasons for disregarding these events include the subacute presentation in some cases and the variable latency period (from days to years), which makes ascertainment of the causality link difficult. 2 The 1976 national influenza immunisation programme against swine flu subtype A/NJ/ 76 in the USA was stopped because {{of the emergence of}} Guillain-Barré syndrome in some vaccine recipients. The USA, the UK, and Germany have initiated active surveillance studies to detect potential rare adverse events, and “the overall risk–benefit assessments must be interpreted very carefully, since the composition <b>of</b> annual <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> varies each season“ 3 and the risk of side-effects might depend on the subtype, or adjuvants, or both. For the past few years, all post-vaccination events have been included in the spectrum of autoimmune or inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants, because of previous exposure to immune adjuvants, including those used in vaccines to boost an immune response. 4 In our Periodic Fevers Research Centre, which admits patients with fever of unknown origin, over 6 years we identified ten cases of giant cell arteritis or polymyalgia rheumatica, occurring within 3 months <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> vaccination. A Medline search from 1978 to 2011 showed 11 isolated cases of the same disorders happening after influenza vaccination. 5 Such disorders are common in people older than 65 years, who are a major target <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> vaccination policy. In the Comment accompanying Osterholm and colleagues' meta-analysis, Heath Kelly and Marta Valenciano 6 state that “now might also be an appropriate time to use revised estimates of the most probable <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> to re-examine the <b>effectiveness</b> and cost-effectiveness <b>of</b> some policy options”. We support this statement and suggest that evaluation of the costs <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> vaccination should include autoimmune reactions as adverse effects, with both a central worldwide registration system and, where they exist, local active surveillance registries to monitor vaccine safety. This strategy could be useful to identify genetic markers of populations at high risk for after-vaccination autoimmune events and to develop more effective, safe, and personalised vaccines...|$|R
40|$|Ferrets are {{a useful}} animal model for human {{influenza}} virus infections, since they closely mimic {{the pathogenesis of}} influenza viruses observed in humans. However, a lack of reagents, especially for flow cytometry of immune cell subsets, has limited research in this model.

Following infection with seasonal H 3 N 2 or H 1 N 1 pdm 09 influenza viruses, these cell types showed rapid and dramatic changes in frequency, even though clinically the infections were mild. The loss of B cells and CD 4 and CD 8 T cells, {{and the increase in}} neutrophils, were especially marked 1 - 2 days after infection, when about 90 % of CD 8 + T cells disappeared from the peripheral blood.

40|$|Influenza {{vaccination}} of Health Care Workers (HCWs) {{is recommended}} by several health authorities worldwide, {{for example the}} Centers for Disease Control (CDC, 2006) and the Association for Professionals in Infection Control (APIC, 2008), aiming to prevent influenza, to reduce staff absenteeism due to illness and to protect vulnerable patient populations from the increased morbidity and mortality that influenza carries. Additionally, the Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that influenza vaccination should {{not be limited to}} staff providing direct patient care, but should be provided as well to clerical, cleaning and security personnel in health care facilities (HCDCP, 2006). Influenza vaccines have proven efficacy against influenza, with efficacy rates ranging from 50 to 80 % depending on the degree of matching between vaccine and circulating influenza strains (Demicheli et al, 2007). Moreover, Burls et al (2006) have conducted an economic evaluation of influenza vaccination of HCWs and concluded that the vaccine is cost- effective and cost- saving. However, despite recommendations and proven efficacy and cost <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine,</b> vaccination rates persist to be low internationally. There are several studies reporting vaccination rates of HCWs at health care facilities. Influenza vaccination rates vary widely among countries, for example vaccinatio...|$|E
40|$|The <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> in {{reducing}} hospital admissions for pneumonia, influenza, bronchitis, or emphysema {{was assessed by}} a case-control study of people aged 16 years and older who were admitted to 10 Leicestershire hospitals between 1 December 1989 and 31 January 1990. Hospital and general practitioners' records for 156 admissions (the cases) and 289 controls matched for age and sex were reviewed. Information was collected on demography, the {{usual place of residence}} (institutional or non-institutional), the existence of chronic illness, and vaccination during the 5 years before admission. The odds ratio for hospital admission among vaccinees was 0. 67 (95 % CI 0. 39 - 1. 12) giving an estimate of vaccine effectiveness in this setting of 33 % (95 % CI 0 - 61). However, multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for the effects of institutional care and chronic illness, revealed that influenza vaccination reduced hospital admissions by 63 % (95 % CI 17 - 84 %). There was a strong trend towards improved vaccine effectiveness when used in institutional settings. Influenza vaccine is effective {{in reducing}} hospital admissions for influenza, pneumonia, bronchitis and emphysema, and effectiveness is comparable to that observed for influenza and pneumonia admissions in North America...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> in preventing hospital admission for pneumonia in non-institutionalised elderly people. DESIGN: This was a case-control study. SETTING: All three public {{hospitals in the}} Castellón area of Spain. PARTICIPANTS: Cases were people aged 65 or more not living in an institution who were admitted to hospital for pneumonia between November 15, 1994 and March 31, 1995. Each case was matched with two sex matched control subjects aged 65 years or older admitted to hospital in the same week for acute abdominal surgical conditions or trauma. The sampling of incident cases was consecutive. Eighty three cases and 166 controls were identified and included in the study. MEASUREMENTS: Trained interviewers completed a questionnaire for each subject on the vaccination status, smoking habits, previous diseases, health care use, social contacts, family background, the vaccination status of the family carer, home characteristics, and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio of the influenza vaccination preventing admission to hospital for pneumonia was 0. 21 (95 % confidence interval 0. 09, 0. 55). The variables which best explained {{the risk of being}} a case were age, intensity of social contacts, health care use, previous diseases, and the existence of a vaccinated family carer. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination reduced significantly hospital admissions for pneumonia in non-institutionalised elderly people...|$|E
40|$|Poster Sessions: no. P- 79 BACKGROUND: Each {{year older}} adults aged ≥ 65 years have highest risk for complications, hospitalizations, and deaths from {{seasonal}} influenza virus infections. There are numerous reports of lower immunogenicity and <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> in older adults compared to younger and middle-aged adults. In subtropical and tropical locations where Influenza circulates for prolonged periods of the year, vaccinating older adults every 6 months {{could increase the}} likelihood that vaccine components would match circulating influenza viruses as well as enhancing the magnitude, breadth, and duration of immune response and therefore increasing or prolonging protection against infection. METHOD: Using existing surveillance data, we constructed a simulation model to assess the impact <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> twice-annual vaccination vs annual vaccination where impact is defined as the number of averted health outcomes in Hong Kong. The model parameters were derived from the literature. RESULTS: We estimated that twice-annual vaccination could avert 2201 influenza-associated hospitalizations and 116 influenza-associated deaths each year among older adults, relative to once-annual vaccination, if assuming 50 % coverage for both annual vaccination and twice-annual vaccination, and 60 % vaccine effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Twice-annual influenza vaccination in Hong Kong has the potential to provide considerable health benefit in terms of averted hospitalizations and deaths in older adults...|$|R
40|$|The exact {{magnitude}} of the benefit <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> among elderly individuals is subject of considerable debated. Existing vaccine effectiveness estimates come mostly from observational studies, which may be biased because of difficulties in identifying and adjusting for confounders. In this paper, we examine the potential sources of bias in observational studies <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> <b>effectiveness</b> in the elderly and we discuss available evidence regarding the efficacy and <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> licensed <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Although several methodological criticisms among the available analyses on seasonal vaccines for elderly were identified, overall seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> showed relevant efficacy/effectiveness in reducing the risk <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> and its complications in the elderly, considering different measure of outcome...|$|R
40|$|Most {{evidence}} <b>of</b> the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{comes from}} {{studies conducted in}} primary care, but less is known about their effectiveness in preventing serious complications. Here, we examined the <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> effectiveness (IVE) against hospitalization with PCR-confirmed influenza in the predominant A(H 3 N 2) 2011 - 2012 influenza season. A hospital-based, test-negative {{study was conducted in}} nine hospitals in Valencia, Spain. All emergency admissions with a predefined subset of symptoms were eligible. We enrolled consenting adults age 18 and over, targeted for <b>influenza</b> vaccination because <b>of</b> comorbidity, with symptoms of influenza-like-illness within seven days of admission. We estimated IVE as (1 -adjusted vaccination odds ratio) * 100 after accounting for major confounders, calendar time and recruitment hospital. The subjects included 544 positive for influenza A(H 3 N 2) and 1, 370 negative for influenza admissions. Age was an IVE modifying factor. Regardless of vaccine administration, IVE was 72 % (38 to 88 %) in subjects aged under 65 and 21 % (- 5 % to 40 %) in subjects aged 65 and over. By type of vaccine, the IVE of classical intramuscular split-influenza vaccine, used in subjects 18 to 64, was 68 % (12 % to 88 %). The IVE for intradermal and virosomal <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines,</b> used in subjects aged 65 and over, was 39 % (11 % to 58 %) and 16 % (- 39 % to 49 %), respectively. The split-influenza vaccine was effective in preventing influenza-associated hospitalizations in adults aged under 65. The intradermal vaccine was moderately effective in those aged 65 and over...|$|R
