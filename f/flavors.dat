5|$|In the 1990s, Sauvignon blanc {{wines from}} the {{maritime}} climatic regions of New Zealand, particularly the South Island, became popular on the wine market. In the Marlborough Region, sandy soils over slate shingles {{have become the}} most desirable locations for plantings due to the good drainage of the soil and poor fertility that encourages the vine to concentrate its <b>flavors</b> in lower yields. In the flood plain of the Wairau River Valley, the soil runs in east-west bands across the area. This can create a wide diversity of <b>flavors</b> for vineyards that are planted north-south with the heavier soils producing more herbaceous wines from grapes that ripen late and vines planted in stonier soils ripening earlier and imparting more lush and tropical <b>flavors.</b> It is this difference in soils, {{and the types of}} harvest time decisions that wine producers must make, that add a unique element to New Zealand Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wine}} {{regions of the}} Left Bank, the Cabernet {{influence}} of the wine has shown unique characteristics in the different regions. In Saint-Estèphe and Pessac-Léognan, the grape develops more mineral <b>flavors.</b> Aromas of violets are a characteristic of Margaux. Pauillac is noted by a strong lead pencil scent and Saint-Julien by cedar and cigar boxes. The Cabernet wines of the Moulis are characterized by their soft tannins and rich fruit <b>flavors</b> while the southern Graves region is characterized by strong blackcurrant <b>flavors,</b> though in less intense wines over all. The percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon used in the blend will depend on terroir and the winemakers styles {{as well as the}} vintage. The First Growth estates of Château Mouton Rothschild and Château Latour are noted for regularly producing wines with some of the highest percentage of Cabernet— often around 75%.|$|E

5|$|Two other {{well known}} Cabernet Sauvignon <b>flavors</b> are mint and eucalyptus. Mint <b>flavors</b> are often {{associated}} with wine regions that are warm enough to have low pyrazine levels but are still generally cool, such as Australia's Coonawarra region and some areas of Washington State. There is some belief that soil {{could also be a}} contributor to the minty notes, since the flavor also appears in some wines from the Pauillac region but not from similar climate of Margaux. Resinous Eucalyptus <b>flavors</b> tend to appear in regions that are habitats for the eucalyptus tree, such as California's Napa and Sonoma valleys and parts of Australia, but there has been no evidence to conclusively prove a direct link between proximity of eucalyptus trees and the presence of that flavor in the wine.|$|E
5|$|While New World Cabernets are {{characterized}} as being drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers {{such as the}} Californian cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop {{for two to three}} decades. Overall, the majority of Californian Cabernets are meant to be approachable after only a couple of years in the bottle but can still have the potential to improve further over time. Similarly many premium Australian Cabernet will also need at least ten years to develop though many are approachable after two to five years. New Zealand wines are typically meant to be consumed young and will often maintain their green herbal <b>flavors</b> even with extended bottle aging. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit <b>flavors</b> when they are young and the best made examples will maintain some of those <b>flavors</b> as they age. South African wines tend to favor more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years' aging before they start to develop further <b>flavors.</b>|$|E

40|$|Color {{stability}} and <b>flavor</b> {{are two of}} the most important aspects of red wine quality. The development of anthocyanins and tannins in Pinot noir grapes and their relative importance in wine has been under investigation by Dr. James Kennedy. <b>Flavor</b> development, however, is not well understood. Several gas chromatography/olfactometry techniques have been used to study important aroma compounds in wines. By using an Osme technique(1), Miranda-Lopez et al. (2) investigated the volatile compounds in Pinot noir wines of different vantages. They found that the aroma character varies significantly with vintage and with maturity within a given vintage. It has been noticed that late grapes produce more <b>flavored</b> wines (2), however, {{it is not clear that}} this <b>flavor</b> change is due to wine making practice, <b>flavor</b> or <b>flavor</b> precursor changes in the grapes, or enzyme activity changes. In addition, <b>flavor</b> analysis in the wine poses technical difficulties to obtain reliable quantitative data due to its complexity after fermentation. The objectives of this research project are to understand the most important <b>flavor</b> compounds formed during berry development in Pinot noir fruit to understand their effects on Pinot noir wine <b>flavor</b> and wine quality. The project starts with the identification of important <b>flavor</b> compounds responsible for Oregon Pinot noir wine, and determine which compounds are generated from grapes (first year). After the grape <b>flavor</b> compounds are identified, the effect of berry development on the selected <b>flavor</b> and <b>flavor</b> precursors composition will be investigated (second year). Lastly, the effect of berry development on the <b>flavor</b> and <b>flavor</b> precursor composition on experimental wines will be investigated (third year). The information generated from this study will supplement <b>flavor</b> and <b>flavor</b> precursor information for other grape components (anthocyanins, sugar and acids) and correlate grape composition with wine quality. The ultimate results are to investigate possible optimum fruit harvest time based on <b>flavor,</b> <b>flavor</b> precursors, tannins, sugars and acid development in grapes to consistently make high quality Pinot noir wines...|$|R
40|$|We {{show there}} is a non-null {{probability}} to produce neutrinos of the "wrong" type in general decays, within the SM augmented by the known three massive neutrinos and nontrivial mixing. Such effect is equivalent to an intrinsic <b>flavor</b> violation (lepton <b>flavor</b> violation) at creation without requiring neutrino propagation. The exact amount of <b>flavor</b> violation depends on the neutrino <b>flavor</b> state to be detected. For realistic conditions, the violation is tiny but much larger than other indirect lepton <b>flavor</b> violation processes not involving neutrinos as final states. For neutrinos produced in a continuous spectrum, we show the effect is larger, in relative terms, for neutrinos produced in the low-energy portion of the spectrum.

5|$|In {{addition}} to ripeness levels, the harvest yields {{can also have}} a strong influence in the resulting quality and <b>flavors</b> of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The vine itself is prone to vigorous yields, particularly when planted on the vigorous SO4 rootstock. Excessive yields can result in less concentrated and flavorful wine with <b>flavors</b> more on the green or herbaceous side. In the 1970s, a particular clone of Cabernet Sauvignon that was engineered to be virus free was noted for its very high yields-causing many quality conscious producers to replant their vineyards in the late 20th century with different clonal varieties. To reduce yields, producers can plant the vines on less vigorous rootstock and also practice green harvesting with aggressive pruning of grape clusters soon after veraison.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} noted traits of Cabernet Sauvignon is its {{affinity}} for oak, either during fermentation or in barrel aging. In addition to having a softening effect on the grape's naturally high tannins, the unique wood <b>flavors</b> of vanilla and spice complement the natural grape <b>flavors</b> of blackcurrant and tobacco. The particular success of Cabernet-based Bordeaux blends in the 225 liter (59 gallon) barrique were a significant influence in making that barrel size one {{of the most}} popular worldwide. In winemaking, the decision for the degree of oak influence (as well as which type of oak) will have a strong impact on the resulting wine. American oak, particularly from new barrels, imparts stronger oak <b>flavors</b> that are less subtle than those imparted by French oak. Even within the American oak family, the location of the oak source also plays a role with oak from the state of Oregon having more pronounced influence on Cabernet Sauvignon than oak from Missouri, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Winemakers often use a variety of oak barrels from different locations and of different ages and blend the wine as if they are blending different grape varieties.|$|E

5|$|Winemakers {{can also}} control the {{influence}} of oak by using alternatives to the standard barrique barrels. Larger barrels have a smaller wood-to-wine ratio and therefore less pronounced oak <b>flavors.</b> Winemakers in Italy and Portugal sometimes use barrels made from other wood types such as chestnut and redwood. Another method that winemakers consider is tea bagging with oak chips or adding oak planks to the wines while fermenting or aging it in stainless steel tanks. While these methods are less costly than oak barrels, they create more pronounced oak <b>flavors,</b> which tend not to mellow or integrate {{with the rest of}} the wine's components; nor do they provide the gradual oxidation benefit of barrel aging.|$|E
5|$|Winemakers in New Zealand and Chile {{harvest the}} grapes at various {{intervals}} {{for the different}} blending characteristics that the grape can impart depending on its ripeness levels. At its most unripe stage, the grape is high in malic acid. As it progresses further towards ripeness the grape develops red & green pepper <b>flavors</b> and eventually achieves a balance of sugars. The <b>flavors</b> characteristic of Sauvignon blanc come from the chemicals methoxypyrazines. Grapes grown in Marlborough's Wairau Valley may exhibit different levels of ripeness over the vineyard, caused by slight unevenness in the land and giving a similar flavor profile to the resulting wine.|$|E
