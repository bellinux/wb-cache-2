5|$|On November 29, 2009, at 4:27am, two trains {{collided}} at the West Falls Church train yard. One train {{pulled in}} and collided <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the other train. No customers were aboard, and only minor injuries to the operators and cleaning staff were reported. However, three cars (1106, 1171, and 3216) {{were believed to}} be damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Kroger tells Monk he {{has found}} a therapist, Dr. Jonah Sorenson (Rick Curry); in session, he remembers where the rock came from. Monk goes to Dr. Kroger's office and shows Dr. Kroger the rock came from the courtyard, to which only Dr. Kroger and Merrigan have access to. In Merrigan's office, they find {{powdered}} milk but not a coffeemaker and, as powdered milk is made from lactose and drug dealers use it to cut heroin, Monk deduces Merrigan is trafficking drugs, and he probably also killed Teresa. Suddenly, Merrigan appears, ties them to chairs, and loads them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> his truck.|$|E

There is no interstate standard for the transportation of migrant workers.|$|R
30|$|Subcutaneous air pouches were {{produced}} under ketamine anesthesia. Twenty-four milliliters sterile air was injected subcutaneously through a 0.25  μm microfilter <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animals {{to create a}} pseudosynovial cavity (Ferrari et al. 1996; Nagase et al. 1998). A second air injection was given 3  days after, if needed, to keep the air pouch inflated.|$|R
5|$|In the 37th minute, Bahr took a {{long shot}} from twenty-five yards out, but as Williams moved to his right to intercept, Gaetjens dived headlong near the penalty spot, and grazed the ball enough to {{put it to the}} left of the English goalkeeper, whose {{momentum}} prevented him from changing direction, and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the net. The crowd exploded as the U.S. improbably led 1–0. As the half drew to a close, Finney had a chance to equalize, but the whistle blew before he could shoot.|$|E
5|$|In {{the video}} Rihanna and two friends {{arrive at a}} nightclub in a yellow taxi, and enter a candy store where a boy is {{standing}} with his mother. Rihanna tells the boy not to tell anyone where they are going, and the singer and her friends sneak <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the store (where there is a secret nightclub entrance). The narrative is intercut with Rihanna singing the song against a wall and dancing in the club. After she enters the club, she checks her makeup in a restroom as she sings.|$|E
5|$|Queen's went on {{the attack}} once again, with Christie going on a run but losing {{possession}} to Hargreaves. After around 30 minutes of play, Hargreaves passed the ball to his teammate Douglas {{who went on to}} score Rovers' first goal. Queen's Park then committed the second handball of the game, giving Rovers a free kick. Brown took the ball up the wing, and centred it towards Forrest, who turned the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the Queen's Park goal and put Blackburn two ahead. In response, Queen's Park's attacks on the Blackburn defence increased, and they scored through Christie before half time.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the hidden zipper {{started to make}} its way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> dresses, skirts, and other garments, thereby making back {{closures}} not so noticeable. But since 2010, {{there has been a}} style to have extra conspicuous zippers on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> dresses, skirts, and blouses, which on not all garments need to be opened to don or remove the garment. Some have fancy pull tabs. Others expose on the exterior not only the teeth of the zipper but also the fabric.|$|R
5|$|The {{indwelling}} cannula: Outside of the United States, many piercers use {{a needle}} containing a cannula (or catheter), a hollow plastic tube {{placed at the}} end of the needle. In some countries, the piercing needle favoured in the United States is regarded as a medical device and is illegal for body piercers. The procedure is similar to the piercing needle method, but the initial jewellery is inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the cannula and the cannula and the jewellery are then pulled through the piercing. More bleeding may follow, as the piercing is larger than the jewellery.|$|E
5|$|The race {{began with}} Kubica in pole {{position}} alongside Massa; Lewis Hamilton, the eventual Drivers' Champion, started from third, alongside Räikkönen. Kubica {{was passed by}} Massa into the first corner, and then by Räikkönen on the third lap. The Ferraris dominated {{at the front of}} the race, leading to their 1–2 finish. Hamilton had a slow start after almost stalling on the grid, and dropped back to ninth. The McLaren driver ran <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> Fernando Alonso's Renault a lap later, breaking off the McLaren's front wing and dropping Hamilton to the back of the field.|$|E
5|$|As the air {{ambulance}} prepares to land outside {{the emergency department}} a rotor blade is struck by a drone, causing the helicopter to crash land {{in the parking lot}} outside the hospital and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> an ambulance, causing the ambulance to knock scaffolding down over Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford). The tail of the helicopter smashes into the entrance of the emergency department causing brutal injuries. The department is shut down following the incident, with Connie and Grace’s lives prioritised. Grace is freed from the helicopter and taken into the department for treatment. Connie learns Grace has life-threatening injuries and may not survive surgery. The staff at Holby City come together to treat casualties of the accident. Grace survives surgery, but remains in a critical condition.|$|E

Ian and Erin are working at a hardware store; Wendy saves Ian from being impaled by falling planks of wood, causing Death to skip him and move onto Erin, who falls onto a nail gun and is shot repeatedly in the head. Though questioned by the police after Erin's death, both Wendy and Kevin are let go. Assuming that whoever was next must be dead, they decide to ensure their own safety. While leaving the police station, Wendy is stalked by a grief-stricken Ian.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 20 March 2011, a group of 20 to 25 masked men, some armed with rifles and {{accompanied}} by dozens of uniformed Bahraini security forces, broke into Rajab's house. Rajab was detained and his files and a computer were confiscated. He reported that they blindfolded and handcuffed him and put him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> a vehicle before verbally abusing, beating and threatening to rape him. He claimed that they kicked him when he refused to say that he loved the prime minister. He was taken to a Ministry of Interior detention facility in Adliya, a suburb of Manama. After being briefly questioned about someone he did not know, he was released.|$|E
5|$|On 21 May 2010, Chamakh {{completed}} his move to Arsenal on a free transfer after completing {{his contract with}} Bordeaux. The transfer took effect on 1 July 2010. He made his debut in a pre-season friendly against Barnet on 17 July, appearing as a substitute. On 27 July, he scored his first pre-season goal for the club, converting a penalty in a 4–0 victory over Austrian club SC Neusiedl. In the 2010 edition of the Emirates Cup, Chamakh scored on his home debut against Italian club Milan. On 7 August 2010, he scored the first goal in 6-5 win against Legia Warsaw in a friendly match and the last match for pre-season. He made his Premier League debut on 15 August in the team's 1–1 draw with Liverpool. Chamakh contributed to the team's equalising goal by heading a cross off the goal post, which then redirected off goalkeeper Pepe Reina and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the net, resulting in an own goal.|$|E

5|$|On November 12, 1976, as Fox {{was driving}} to the family home at Morrill Street in Port Coquitlam, he became distracted by nearby bridge construction, and crashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> a pickup truck. While his car was left undriveable, Fox emerged with only a sore right knee. He again felt pain in December, but chose to ignore it {{until the end of}} {{basketball}} season. By March 1977, the pain had intensified and he finally went to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of cancer that often starts near the knees. Fox believed his car accident weakened his knee and left it vulnerable to the disease, though his doctors argued there was no connection. He was told that his leg had to be amputated, he would require chemotherapy treatment, and that recent medical advances meant he had a 50-percent chance of survival. Fox learned that two years before, the figure would have been only 15 percent; the improvement in survival rates impressed on him the value of cancer research.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with an}} open shot of an {{airplane}} flying surrounded by many doves, referencing the works of Hong Kong director John Woo. Spears appears with blond hair dressed as a flight attendant, receiving a phone call. After serving some of the passengers, she leads a middle aged overweight man {{to the bathroom and}} seduces him. She peels off the man's mask to reveal an attractive man (Matthew Felker) hiding underneath it and steals a black pass from his pocket when they resume kissing. Spears is then dropped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> a Ducati 999, driven by a shirtless male (Tyson Beckford) in a futuristic Paris, that was compared to the 1982 film Blade Runner. She wears a tight black catsuit and sports red hair, inspired by the character of Sydney Bristow from television series Alias. They pass a woman and lift up her dress, a homage to the iconic Marilyn Monroe scene in the 1955 film The Seven Year Itch. They also pass two women frolicking in a store window.|$|E
5|$|The {{windward}} {{side of the}} Kohala mountains is dissected by multiple, deeply eroded stream valleys in a southwest-northeast alignment, cutting into the flanks of the volcano. North of Kohala's summit the volcano's northwest-southeast trending rift zone separates rainfall into two streams, going southeast, into Waipio Valley, or northwest, into Honokane Nui Valley. When the volcano was still active, vertical sheets of magma, arranged in {{what is known as}} dikes, forced {{their way out of the}} magma reservoir and intruded into the rift zone, which was weakened by the collapse. As the dikes forced their way up, they formed fractures and faults parallel to the rift zone. The exertion caused by the dikes produced a series of faults along its length, forming horsts and grabens (fault blocks). Northeast of the Kohala summit, where the most rainfall occurs, the faulted structure prevents summit rainwater from naturally flowing northeast down the mountain slope. Instead, the rainwater flows down laterally and empties <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> what have thus become the largest valleys (Waipio and Honokane Nui).|$|E

Meanwhile, the Mujahideen attack the air base on horseback and engage the Soviets in a gun battle. During the battle, Milovy drives a jeep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the plane as Bond takes off, and Necros also leaps aboard at the last second. After a struggle, Bond throws Necros to his death and deactivates the bomb. Bond then notices Shah and his men being pursued by Soviet forces. He re-activates the bomb and drops it out of the plane and onto a bridge, blowing it up and helping Shah and his men gain an important victory over the Soviets. Bond returns to Tangier to kill Whitaker, infiltrating his estate with the help of his ally Felix Leiter, as Pushkin arrests Koskov, sending him back to Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Albion's sole goalscoring {{opportunity}} {{of the second}} half came afterwards; Clark took the ball on a lengthy run before crossing it into the box, across an open goal with no Albion player there to tap the ball in and put the game beyond QPR's reach. Fifteen minutes {{from the end of the}} match QPR equalised, Marsh's shot with his right foot went in off the post. A corner followed for QPR who were now dominating Albion with their style of play. Allen crossed it in to Lazarus, but the Albion goalkeeper saved the shot with his legs. With eight minutes to go, one of Albion defenders mis-kicked the ball in their own penalty area. Hunt rushed in for the chance but Sheppard once again saved the game for Albion. The ball ran free to Mike Lazarus who tapped the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> an empty net to increase the scoreline to 3–2 in QPR's favour. A final attack from QPR came in the closing moments of the game as Lazarus took the ball past two defenders and into the box, his subsequent shot hit the outside of the post and went wide.|$|E
5|$|At 3:50 pm {{the prisoners}} left H7, {{and the driver}} and a prison orderly were taken back to the lorry, and the driver's foot tied to the clutch. 37 prisoners climbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the lorry, while Kelly {{lay on the floor}} of the cab with a gun pointed at the driver, who was also told the cab had been booby trapped with a hand grenade. At nearly 4:00 pm the lorry drove towards the main gate of the prison, where the prisoners {{intended}} to take over the gatehouse. Ten prisoners dressed in guards' uniforms and armed with guns and chisels dismounted from the lorry and entered the gatehouse, where they took the officers hostage. At 4:05 pm the officers began to resist, and an officer pressed an alarm button. When other staff responded via an intercom, a senior officer said while being held at gunpoint that the alarm had been triggered accidentally. By this time the prisoners were struggling to maintain control in the gatehouse due to the number of hostages. Officers arriving for work were entering the gatehouse from outside the prison, and each was ordered at gunpoint to join the other hostages. Officer James Ferris ran from the gatehouse towards the pedestrian gate attempting to raise the alarm, pursued by Dermot Finucane. Ferris had already been stabbed three times in the chest, and before he could raise the alarm he collapsed.|$|E
