2500|$|As the {{population}} of metropolitan Calgary increases and growing suburbs require new lines and extensions, the higher train volumes will exceed {{the ability of the}} downtown section along 7th Avenue S to accommodate them. To provide for long-term expansion, the city is reviewing its plans to put parts of the downtown section underground. The current plans allow the expanded Blue Line (Northeast/West) to use the existing 7th Avenue S surface infrastructure. The expanded Red Line (Northwest/South), now sharing 7th Avenue S with the Blue Line, will be relocated to a new tunnel dug beneath 8th Avenue S. The future Southeast/Downtown route will probably enter downtown through a shorter tunnel under one or more streets (candidates include 2nd Street W, 5th Street W, 6th Street W, 8th Avenue S, 10th Avenue S, 11th Avenue S, and 12th Avenue S). [...] Although Calgary City Council commissioned a <b>functional</b> <b>study</b> for the downtown metro component of the CTrain system in November 2007, the city is unlikely to complete this expansion before 2017 unless additional funding is received from provincial or federal governments.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the clinical significance of routine postoperative voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and renal <b>functional</b> <b>studies</b> in the postoperative management of children after a transtrigonal ureteric reimplantation. METHODS: A retrospective record review of 126 consecutive patients undergoing transtrigonal ureteric reimplantation. Inclusion criteria included primary reflux and > 5 years of follow-up. Follow-up imaging studies consisted of serial renal ultrasounds (US) and one VCUG and intravenous urogram (IVU) each. RESULTS: Of 126 patients, 2 required a reoperation for contralateral reflux and pyelonephritis. In all other patients {{the results of}} the VCUG did not alter management. Dilatation seen in IVU was always visible in the renal US as well and always resolved spontaneously. No new dilatation was observed after 1 year of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Routine postoperative VCUG and renal <b>functional</b> <b>studies</b> are not warranted in asymptomatic patients after transtrigonal reimplantation. Only in patients with postoperative pyelonephritis did the imaging studies alter the treatment. In the majority of patients, follow-up with an early and 1 -year renal US may suffice.

5000|$|Potassium {{channels}} of vertebrate neurons display {{a high degree}} of diversity that allows neurons to precisely tune their electrical signaling properties by expression of different combinations of potassium channel subunits. Furthermore, because they regulate ionic flux across biological membranes, they are important in many aspects of cellular regulation and signal transduction of different cell types. Therefore, voltage-gated potassium channels are targets {{for a wide range of}} potent biological toxins from such organisms as snakes, scorpions, sea anemones, and cone snails. Thus, venom purification has led to the isolation of peptide toxins such as the dendrotoxins, which have become useful pharmacological tools for the study of potassium channels. Because of their potency and selectivity for different subtypes of potassium channels, dendrotoxins have become useful as molecular probes for the structural and <b>functional</b> <b>study</b> of these proteins. This may help improve our understanding of the roles played by individual channel types, as well as assist in the pharmacological classification of these diverse channel types. [...] Furthermore, the availability of radiolabelled dendrotoxins provides a tool for the screening of other sources in a search for new potassium channel toxins, such as the kalicludine class of potassium channel toxins in sea anemones. Lastly, the structural information provided by dendrotoxins may provide clues to the synthesis of therapeutic compounds that may target particular classes of potassium channels.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Complex {{diseases}} {{are associated with}} altered interactions between thousands of genes. We developed a novel method to identify and prioritize disease genes, which was generally applicable to complex diseases. RESULTS: We identified modules of highly interconnected genes in disease-specific networks derived from integrating gene-expression and protein interaction data. We examined if those modules were enriched for disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and {{could be used to}} find novel genes for <b>functional</b> <b>studies.</b> First, we analyzed publicly available gene expression microarray and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from 13, highly diverse, complex diseases. In each disease, highly interconnected genes formed modules, which were significantly enriched for genes harboring disease-associated SNPs. To test if such modules could be used to find novel genes for <b>functional</b> <b>studies,</b> we repeated the analyses using our own gene expression microarray and GWAS data from seasonal allergic rhinitis. We identified a novel gene, FGF 2, whose relevance was supported by <b>functional</b> <b>studies</b> using combined siRNA-mediated knock-down and gene expression microarrays. The modules in the 13 complex diseases analyzed here tended to overlap and were enriched for pathways related to oncological, metabolic and inflammatory diseases. This suggested that this union of the modules would be associated with a general increase in susceptibility for complex diseases. Indeed, we found that this union was enriched with GWAS genes for 145 other complex diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Modules of highly interconnected complex disease genes were enriched for disease-associated SNPs, and could be used to find novel genes for <b>functional</b> <b>studies...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractApraxia, a {{disorder}} of higher motor cognition, {{is a frequent}} and outcome-relevant sequel of left hemispheric stroke. Deficient pantomiming of object use constitutes a key symptom of apraxia and is assessed when testing for apraxia. To date the neural basis of pantomime remains controversial. We here review the literature and perform a meta-analysis of the relevant structural and <b>functional</b> imaging (fMRI/PET) <b>studies.</b> Based on a systematic literature search, 10 structural and 12 <b>functional</b> imaging <b>studies</b> were selected. Structural lesion studies associated pantomiming deficits with left frontal, parietal and temporal lesions. In contrast, <b>functional</b> imaging <b>studies</b> associate pantomimes with left parietal activations, with or without concurrent frontal or temporal activations. <b>Functional</b> imaging <b>studies</b> that selectively activated parietal cortex adopted the most stringent controls. In contrast to previous suggestions, current analyses show that both lesion and <b>functional</b> <b>studies</b> support {{the notion of a}} left-hemispheric fronto-(temporal) -parietal network underlying pantomiming object use. Furthermore, our review demonstrates that the left parietal cortex {{plays a key role in}} pantomime-related processes. More specifically, stringently controlled fMRI-studies suggest that in addition to storing motor schemas, left parietal cortex is also involved in activating these motor schemas in the context of pantomiming object use. In addition to inherent differences between structural and <b>functional</b> imaging <b>studies</b> and consistent with the dedifferentiation hypothesis, the age difference between young healthy subjects (typically included in <b>functional</b> imaging <b>studies)</b> and elderly neurological patients (typically included in structural lesion studies) may well contribute to the finding of a more distributed representation of pantomiming within the motor-dominant left hemisphere in the elderly...|$|R
