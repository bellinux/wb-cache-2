The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of cold Lifor solution on preservation of swine small bowel. Methods. Swine ileum segments (200 [*]cm) were allotransplanted heterotopically after 9 -hour cold storage with UW solution (group 1, n= 6), with Lifor solution (group 2, n= 6), or without storage (group 3, n= 6), respectively. After cold storage, mucosal adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations and histopathologic analysis after preservation were performed.

The addition of exogenous sphingomyelinase, which hydrolysed 60 % of prelabelled sphingomyelin, resulted in a 50 % decrease in the uptake of cholesterol from bile salt micelles. The flux of membrane cholesterol into the cell by the hydrolysis of membrane sphingomyelin decreased the rate of cholesterol synthesis by 43 % and inhibited hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity by 54 %. Moreover, the rate of cholesterol esterification was increased 4 -fold. Total cellular cholesterol mass was unchanged {{by the addition of}} sphingomyelinase; however, cholesteryl esters increased by 50 % and the amount of unesterified cholesterol decreased significantly. The basolateral secretion of cholesterol mass was also decreased following sphingomyelin hydrolysis. Human pancreatic juice was found to contain neutral sphingomyelinase activity which required taurocholate for full expression. The presence of neutral sphingomyelinase activity was also documented in membranes prepared from CaCo- 2 cells and in whole homogenates from human duodenal biopsies.

Pig calbindin D 28 k-immunoreactive absorptive cells were prominent in duodenum, they were scattered along the villi and nearly absent in the crypts.

Newborn foals were either fed COL (n = 5) or an equal amount of milk replacer (MR, n = 7) during the first 24 hours of life. To ensure passive immunity, all foals received 1 L plasma. Postnatal development, meconium release, intestinal motility, white blood cell count, insulin-like growth factor 1, and <b>intestinal</b> <b>absorptive</b> function (xylose absorption test) were evaluated. Clinical findings and meconium release were not affected by feeding of COL or MR. Ultrasonography revealed a slightly larger jejunum and stomach in group COL versus MR (P < 0. 05).

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{elucidate}} {{the mechanism of}} drug absorption from the colloidal micellar and vesicular species that form in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract during lipid digestion. In addition to absorption from the free fraction of drug molecules that exist in equilibrium with drug solubilised in the colloidal reservoir, two alternative models of drug absorption were explored: (i) collisional drug absorption where lipid colloidal phases interact directly with the absorptive membrane, and (ii) supersaturation-enhanced absorption where transient changes to colloid structure and content in situ lead to drug supersaturation, thereby boosting drug thermodynamic activity and rendering solubilised drug more available for absorption via the free fraction. Collisional drug absorption was explored by comparing the <b>intestinal</b> <b>absorptive</b> flux of cinnarizine (CIN) from two distinctly different colloids (micelles vs. vesicles) that were matched for CIN solubilisation capacity and drug loading (and therefore thermodynamic activity). In these systems the number of micellar particles was substantially {{higher than that of}} vesicles, and as such collisional absorption of CIN was expected to be higher from micelles. The absorption of CIN from micelles and vesicles, however, was not statistically different, suggesting little collisional involvement in drug absorption. Receptor-mediated collisional absorption was examined by assessing CIN bioavailability from a lipid emulsion in the absence and presence of inhibitors of common lipid uptake transporters (e. g. SR-BI, CD 36, NPC 1 L 1). CIN bioavailability was unchanged by inhibitor co-administration. Collectively, the data suggest that collision-mediated uptake is not a significant driver for drug absorption from intestinal lipid colloidal phases, and that drug absorption occurs largely from the free fraction. Subsequently, attention turned to the possibility that drug supersaturation might be stimulated during endogenous processing of intestinal lipid colloidal phases. Two mechanisms were investigated: (i) interaction of lipid colloidal phases with bile secretions, where bile-induced changes to colloid microstructure may lead to reductions in drug solubilisation capacity and (ii) lipid absorption from intestinal colloids, where reductions in colloidal lipid content may reduce drug solubilisation capacity at the intestinal unstirred water layer (UWL). The addition of donor rat bile to CIN-loaded colloids (CIN was loaded at sub-saturated concentrations) resulted in a decrease in CIN solubilisation and the generation of CIN supersaturation. Bile-induced supersaturation was subsequently shown to increase the <b>intestinal</b> <b>absorptive</b> flux and systemic exposure of CIN from both medium-chain and long-chain lipid containing colloids. To assess the potential for lipid absorption to induce drug supersaturation, the <b>intestinal</b> <b>absorptive</b> flux of CIN from oleic acid-containing colloids was assessed under conditions of normal lipid absorption vs. inhibited lipid absorption (oleic acid absorption was inhibited by co-administration of amiloride, an inhibitor of UWL acidity). When oleic acid absorption was suppressed, the absorption of CIN was dramatically attenuated. Assessment of CIN solubilisation behaviour under conditions that simulate lipid absorption at the UWL subsequently indicated that supersaturation was likely to be responsible for the enhanced CIN absorption observed during normal lipid absorption. In summary, supersaturation appears to be an important driving force for drug absorption from lipid-based intestinal colloids. Two novel mechanisms have been identified by which drug supersaturation may be naturally triggered in the small intestine (bile dilution and lipid absorption). The findings enhance mechanistic understanding of the effects of lipids in food or formulations on drug absorption and are expected to inform the development of more rational design criteria for LBF...|$|R

Since these effects of L-tryptophan are energy and Na+ dependent and occur with mucosal but not serosal exposure to L-tryptophan, it appears they are triggered by activation of a Na(+) -nutrient cotransporter in the apical membrane of absorptive cells rather than by the presence of an unidentified trace contaminant. Our findings suggest the possibility that dietary supplementation by L-tryptophan may result in loss of the intestinal epithelial barrier to dietary antigens.

40|$|The cytochemical {{distribution}} of Ca 2 +-Mg 2 +-ATPase was studied ultrastructurally, using a lead capture method at pH 8. 5 and compared in various tissues. In thymic, splenic and activated peripheral blood lymphocytes and in cultured HeLa cells activity was consistently localised {{on the nuclear}} envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria and weakly on centrioles, {{but not on the}} plasma membrane. Intracellular activity was similarly distributed in <b>intestinal</b> <b>absorptive</b> cells where activity was particularly strong in the Golgi apparatus, and in hepatocytes where, however, activity was generally weak. Intracellular activity was lacking in renal glomerular and tubular cells and in cerebellar neurons and neuroglia. Variable activity was present on the outer surface of the plasma membrane, particularly on the brush borders of intestinal and renal tubular absorptive cells, the basolateral invaginations of distal tubules and the bile canaliculi. Mitochondrial activity, when present, was inhibited by oligomycin. The localisation at different sites may represent biochemically different ATPases including endoplasmic reticular ATPase involved in intracellular calcium regulation, oligomycin-sensitive mitochondrial ATPase, dynein-like ATPase associated with centrioles and an ectoenzyme associated with cell surface specialisations...|$|R
