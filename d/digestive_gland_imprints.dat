40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between accumulated copper in the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> of Helix aspersa, after exposure to the fungicide copper oxychloride, and quantitative changes in the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> cells of this snail. Snails were exposed to 80 and 240 μgg- 1 copper oxychloride for 6 weeks. Histological sections of <b>digestive</b> <b>glands</b> were analyzed by means of computer-assisted image analysis. Results indicate that copper is strongly accumulated in the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> and that this organ is the main site of copper accumulation in the snail body. Also, {{as a result of}} copper accumulation in the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland,</b> measurable changes in epithelium cell height and area of this organ occur. In the case of cell height, these changes are dose-related. It is concluded that changes in <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> cells, as a result of copper oxychloride exposure, may possibly serve as biomarkers of exposure to this fungicide. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|We {{determined}} {{the role of}} the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> in the respiratory metabolism of Penaeus setiferus adult males as a step toward proposing a feeding schedule based on the cycle of activity in the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland.</b> We measured pre- and postprandial values for oxygen consumption rate and hemolymph glucose concentrations in live animals, and oxygen consumption rate and glycogen concentration in excised <b>digestive</b> <b>gland.</b> After the animals were fed, which enhanced general metabolic activity, these indices changed. There was a high correlation between the oxygen consumption rate of the animal and the glucose concentration in the hemolymph, and between the oxygen consumption rate by the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> and the glycogen concentration in the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland,</b> all in relation to time after feeding. Correlations support the hypothesis that the energy demand depends upon the metabolic substrate concentration. In this theory, glucose sustains muscle activity (during ingestion of food) and glycogen is the product of the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> during food assimilation. Our observations of metabolic dynamics during the feeding period allowed us to examine the feeding process. The metabolic activity of the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> was highest 6 h after feeding. This could mean that assimilation, having started 2 h after food intake, peaked 6 h after feeding.

40|$|International audienceThe {{evolution}} of the concentration of 8 essential and non essential heavy metals (Ag, Cd, Cu, Co, Fe, Pb, V, Zn) in the tissues (<b>digestive</b> <b>gland,</b> cuttlebone and whole animal) of the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis collected in the Bay of Seine has been tracked {{since the end of}} the embryogenesis until the reproduction period. Compared to the embryos, the juveniles after hatchling display much higher concentrations of Ag, Cu, Fe and Zn suggesting an efficient incorporation from seawater. Conversely, the amounts of Cd, Pb and V in hatchlings remain suggesting that these metals are barely bioavailable for the juveniles. Once the juveniles start to feed, the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> appears to play a major role in the storage of all metals. After only one month of benthic life, the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> already contains up to 90 % of the total metal body burden, indicating that <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> plays a major role in the storage and presumed detoxification of the selected metals. Metal concentrations in the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> increase in a logarithmic fashion with age during the entire life of cuttlefish, except for Ag which decreases as soon as cuttlefish migrate to open sea. This strongly suggests that (1) Ag is depurated from the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> in relation to supposedly lower exposure in less contaminated environments compare to coastal waters and (2) the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> of cephalopod could be a very good indicator of Ag contamination in the marine environment...|$|R

The <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> of both species was characterized by large and numerous lipid droplets in the apical portion of the digestive cells and very few in the basal portion. The apical lipid droplets were released into the lumen of the gland and subsequently rapidly removed.

There was no relationship between lipid concentration and stage of digestion, suggesting that lipid is not stored in the gland after a meal.

ALP levels in haemolymph were shown to increase significantly in females exposed for 14 days to 50 ng E 2 /L, and in males exposed to 100 ng E 2 /L. Exposure for 14 days to all the E 2 concentrations tested resulted in significant increases of ALP levels in the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> of females. Conversely, variations in ALP content of male <b>digestive</b> <b>glands</b> were not significant. Results obtained appeared controversial and somewhat difficult to explain. Indeed, no univocal response by clams was observed after 7 and 14 days exposure to E 2. Further studies need to elucidate the role of E 2 in promoting Vg induction in clams...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{changes of}} food sources were {{investigated}} by analysing the fatty acid profiles of <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> and muscle tissues of the naturally occurring clams Glycymeris nummaria in Mali Ston Bay, Croatia. Total lipids in the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> and the adductor muscle showed parallel changes, {{with a maximum}} after the main spawning event in September. In the <b>digestive</b> <b>gland</b> saturated fatty acids were highly dominant (up to 82 %), indicating detritus as the main food source for this species. This type of food prevailed during the autumn/winter period, {{in contrast to the}} spring/summer period when detritus was enriched with phyto- and, to a lesser extent, zooplankton. Fatty acid composition of muscles indicated highly efficient utilization of ingested food through significant retention of polyunsaturated fatty acid from the clams’ diet during the entire period investigated...|$|R
50|$|Most mollusks have a {{complete}} digestive system with a separate mouth and anus. The mouth leads into a short esophagus {{which leads to a}} stomach. Associated with the stomach are one or more <b>digestive</b> <b>glands</b> or <b>digestive</b> caeca. Digestive enzymes are secreted into the lumen of these glands. Additional extracellular digestion takes place in the stomach. In cephalopods, digestion is entirely extracellular. In the most other mollusks, the terminal stages of digestion are completed intracellularly, within the tissue of the <b>digestive</b> <b>glands.</b> The absorbed nutrients enter the circulatory system for distribution throughout the body or are stored in the <b>digestive</b> <b>glands</b> for later use. Undigested waste pass through an intestine and out through the anus. Other aspects of food collection and processing have already been discussed where appropriate for each group.|$|R
