5|$|Certain {{bird species}} {{associate}} with the Central American squirrel monkey. The birds follow the monkeys {{in an attempt to}} prey on insects and small vertebrates that the monkeys flush out. At Corcovado National Park, bird species known to regularly follow squirrel monkeys include the double-toothed kite, the grey-headed tanager and the tawny-winged woodcreeper, but other woodcreepers and such species as motmots and trogons do so as well. This activity increases during the wet season, when arthropods are <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>find.</b>|$|E
5|$|With paying gigs <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{and paying}} less, Sims turned to {{other sources of}} income.

He also taught footwork to boxing greats Sugar Ray Robinson and Muhammad Ali. Less glamorously, he ran a café, and even worked as a carpenter and a mechanic. Despite the lean times for hoofers, Sims was always able to {{put food on the}} table for his family, having married in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Zong had a 17-man crew when it left Africa, {{which was}} far too small to {{maintain}} adequate sanitary conditions on the ship.

5|$|Some {{collectors}} try {{to acquire}} a basic collection of the more common stamps from 1922 onwards, though that can be difficult now due to the quantity issued. Many collectors concentrate on one type of stamp, such as definitives or commemoratives, or even one issue, such as Gerl definitives. The First Day covers, especially commemoratives with full sets affixed, are popular though the older issues are <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> because less than a million of the high value stamps were printed {{in the early years}} (1929–1940s) for several issues, a far lower number than the 20-plus millions printed for most of the low values during the same period.|$|E
5|$|Like all fairywrens, {{the splendid}} fairywren {{is an active}} and restless feeder, {{particularly}} on open ground near shelter, but also through the lower foliage. Movement {{is a series of}} jaunty hops and bounces, with its balance assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts. However, splendid fairywrens are stronger fliers than most other fairywrens. During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during the heat of the day. Food is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.|$|E

5|$|The white-winged fairywren is {{primarily}} insectivorous; its diet includes small beetles, bugs, moths, praying mantises, caterpillars, and smaller insects, including spiders. The larger insects are typically fed to nestlings by the breeding female and her helpers, including the breeding male. Adults and juveniles forage by hopping along the shrubland floor, and may supplement their diets with seeds and fruits of saltbush (Rhagodia), goosefoot (Chenopodium) and new shoots of samphire.

5|$|The GRC scheme {{has also}} been criticized for raising the bar for the {{opposition}} in elections. First, opposition parties may find it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> competent candidates, including minority candidates, to form teams to contest GRCs. Goh Chok Tong has acknowledged that the GRC scheme benefits the PAP as they can put together stronger teams. With the GRC system the threshold for votes for the opposition is also increased, and opposition parties {{have to take a}} gamble and commit huge proportions of their resources to contest GRCs. Each candidate in a GRC is required to deposit a sum equal to 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the calendar year preceding the election, rounded to the nearest S$500. At the 2011 general election, the deposit was $16,000. Unsuccessful candidates have their deposits forfeited if they do not receive at least one-eighth {{of the total number of}} votes polled in the GRC. Critics have noted that the number of walkovers has generally increased since the introduction of GRCs. To date, only one opposition party, the Workers' Party, has won a GRC: Aljunied, in the 2011 general election.|$|E

25|$|The {{marginal}} value theorem {{is a type}} of optimality model that is often applied to optimal foraging. This theorem is used to describe a situation in which an organism searching for food in a patch must decide when it is economically favorable to leave. While the animal is within a patch, it experiences the law of diminishing returns, where it becomes harder and <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> prey as time goes on. This may be because the prey is being depleted, the prey begins to take evasive action and becomes harder to catch, or the predator starts crossing its own path more as it searches. This law of diminishing returns can be shown as a curve of energy gain per time spent in a patch (Figure 3). The curve starts off with a steep slope and gradually levels off as prey becomes <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>find.</b> Another important cost to consider is the traveling time between different patches and the nesting site. An animal loses foraging time while it travels and expends energy through its locomotion.|$|E

25|$|The slowing {{sales growth}} was {{attributed}} to the maturing PC market, which constituted 66% of Dell's sales, and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as storage, services and servers. Dell's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs, but this became less important as savings became <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price differentiation.|$|E
