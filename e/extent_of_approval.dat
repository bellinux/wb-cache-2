40|$|OBJECTIVE: To obtain {{information}} about new-to-practice family physicians' attitudes toward current health policy options and initiatives. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, mailed survey. SETTING: Ontario family practices. PARTICIPANTS: Residency-trained Ontario family physicians (395 of 564 eligible physicians replied) who were certified between 1989 and 1991. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <b>Extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> or disapproval for 14 health policy options and initiatives. RESULTS: A 70 % {{response rate was}} achieved. More than half of surveyed physicians expressed approval for shifting resources from acute care into preventive care and health promotion (71. 6 % approved), stricter immigration requirements to limit licensing of foreign physicians in Canada (60. 4 %), offering physicians salaries {{as an alternative to}} fee-for-service (54. 0 %), and incentives to physicians who wish to practise in community health centres or other forms of salaried group practice (51. 1 %). Some diversity of opinion was associated with sex, type of practice, primary source of remuneration, and practice location. CONCLUSIONS: These new-to-practice family physicians display diverse views and should not be seen as sharing a single opinion of health care policy options and initiatives. Many approve of changes to the health care system or are willing to consider policy alternatives...|$|E
40|$|Objective - To obtain {{information}} from a cohort of physicians about their attitudes toward current health policy options and initiatives and compare their current attitudes with their attitudes in 1993. Design - Mailed surveys in 1993 and 1999. Participants - Family medicine residency-trained physicians who achieved certification between 1989 and 1991 and resided in Ontario in 1993. Main Outcome Measures - <b>Extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> of health policy options and initiatives and extent of agreement with statements about the health care system. Results - Over 84 % of physicians responding in 1993 responded in 1999, although the overall response rate in 1999 was lower (53 %). Although the group expressed approval (80 %) {{for the use of}} evidence-based medicine, less than forty percent approved of other policy options and initiatives. They were particularly disapproving of changes in physician resource policies and in the acute care sector and of possible primary care reforms. Significantly greater disapproval was seen in 1999 for most policy initiatives first inquired about in 1993. However, in 1999 significantly fewer agreed than in 1993 that some government policies (eg. regarding physician income caps) result in negative outcomes. Conclusion - Many of the policy initiatives that have occurred since 1993 to restructure the health care system and limit the growth of the physician supply were initially viewed favourably by these physicians and are now viewed unfavourably, probably because of their impact on these physicians and their patients. The level of disapproval of proposed initiatives to reform primary care suggest reform should be approached cautiously and in consultation with the profession. physician attitudes, health policy, health care reform...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} of how Swedish adults evaluated political parties and the party leaders under three different survey methods: in-person interviews, telephone inter-views, and mailed questionnaires. Both the party leaders and the parties were evaluated more negatively by people responding on the mailed questionnaires. Telephone and in-person interviewees did not differ significantly. The evidence did not indicate that the mailed questionnaire respondents answered more carelessly or in a less coherent manner. The level of evaluation was affected by the method, but {{the structure of the}} answers was not. The results imply that most estimates of popular support for political leaders underestimate the level of disapproval. How popular are our main political actors? This question has been a major focus throughout the history of public opinion research. The <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> of the U. S. president's performance in office is one of the longest time series available. Comparable measures are taken in many other lands with great frequency. In reporting and interpreting poll results, the marginals themselves are too often taken at face value and almost reified. This stems from a natural desire to make rather absolute statements about how well the political parties and their leaders are liked. However, it is well established that the results from any one survey depend substantially on how the question is worded, the context in which it is asked, {{and a host of other}} situational factors (Schuman and Presser, 1981). This research tradition led Howard Schuman to warn that a distrust of the marginals in any absolute sense is 'one of the first lessons a person should learn when working with survey data ' (Schuman, 1986, p. 433). The general implication of this advice is to expand the search and refine our knowledge of how contextual factors operate in survey research. One strategy is to compare political or social systems which are very different (e. g. Granber...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} how {{experiences in the}} family domain may magnify or mitigate experiences in the peer domain, and how processes in both milieus may influence adolescent substance use. The data derived from 666 European American mother-adolescent dyads and 510 European American father-adolescent dyads. Consistent with individuation-connectedness theory, mothers’ responsiveness lessened their adolescents’ orientation to peers, which, in turn, reduced adolescent substance use. This process was moderated by maternal values regarding adolescent alcohol use; that is, the relation of maternal responsiveness to adolescent substance use depended on the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> maternal <b>approval</b> or disapproval <b>of</b> adolescent alcohol use. Among fathers, closer monitoring was directly associated with less adolescent substance use, with stronger effects among fathers who held more disapproving values regarding adolescent alcohol use.

40|$|AbstractRecently, WHO, EU, Japan and Canada have {{published}} guidelines on biosimilar/follow-on biologics. While {{there seems to}} be no significant difference in the general concept in these guidelines, the data to be submitted for product approval are partially different.

In Japan, there have been many discussions about the amount and <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> data for <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> follow-on biologics. We try to clarify the scientific background and rational for regulatory pathway of biosimilar/follow-on biologics in Japan in comparison with the guidelines available from WHO, EU and Canada.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} teachers’ and students’ attitudes towards the English graduation benchmark {{policy and the}} perceived impact of the policy on students’motivation for learning. Under the policy, students had to pass one of the recommended standardised English proficiency tests in order to graduate. 15 English teachers and 982 non-English majors at a technological university in central Taiwan participated in the study. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were employed for the present study. The {{results showed that the}} policy was approved overall by teachers and students. Students reported relatively high levels of identified regulation(i. e., a more autonomous form of extrinsic motivation) and mastery-approach goals,indicating that they wanted to do well on the exam and had a desire to improve their English proficiency. Differences by gender, year of study, academic discipline, English proficiency levels, and test status in terms of the motivational responses to the policy were also examined in the present study. The results showed that the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> the policy seemed to be more related to students’ English abilities than to other characteristics; the degree of test anxiety was more related to students’ year and their English abilities than to other characteristics; students’ English abilities seemed {{to play an important role}} in determining the adoption of motivational regulations and approaches to learning; and finally, the role of performance-avoidance goals might be more important than other types of achievement goals in this high-stakes testing context. The pedagogical suggestions are proposed as follows: the quality of the English exit exam has to be ensured; students need to be provided with different sets of standards under the policy; appropriate learning strategies, especially deep approaches, have to be taught; and finally, a connection among curriculum,instruction, and the assessment should be facilitated...|$|R

40|$|The merit <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> voting {{has been}} widely {{discussed}} in the past 25 years. The distinct property of this rule is the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> flexibility it allows; any voter can approve as many alternatives/candidates as he wishes. Nevertheless, this advantage is the very reason for two drawbacks <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> voting: its extreme vulnerability to majority decisiveness (Theorem 1) and its extreme vulnerability to erosion of the majority principle (Theorem 2). On the one hand, under some feasible voting strategies any majority of more than 1 / 2 of the voters can guarantee the selection of its most favorable candidate, regardless of the preferences of the other voters. On the other hand, under alternative voting strategies even the largest majority cannot impose its common most preferred candidate. A simultaneous resolution of the two problems is possible by restricted approval voting (RAV), a voting rule that allows partial voter flexibility by restricting the minimal and maximal number of candidates that can be approved. Our main result (Theorem 3) clarifies how the foregone flexibility in voters’ sovereignty mitigates the above mentioned drawbacks under sincere and insincere coordinated voting. Our findings suggest a new possible justification of a particular voting rule {{which is based on}} the significance assigned to three considerations: the advantages of voters’ flexibility, immunity to majority decisiveness and immunity to erosion of the majority principle. Such justification can provide a possible explanation to the prevalent use of some special cases of RAV, notably, of the plurality rule and <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> voting.
