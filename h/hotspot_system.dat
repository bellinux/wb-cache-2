40|$|Abstract—Mobile WiFi {{hotspots}} {{have become}} increasingly popular as a new innovative wireless Internet access technology. Although it has received little attention, adaptive, dynamic (re) assignment of channels in a mobile hotspot router—typically, a smartphone or a laptop or a tablet equipped with heterogeneous network interfaces like 3 G/ 4 G, WiFi, Bluetooth or ZigBee— is key to mobile hotspot performance. To fill this important gap, we present a novel scheme, called Ex 2 R, that finds the best WiFi service-channel by harnessing secondary low-power ZigBee radios accompanied in mobile <b>hotspot</b> <b>systems,</b> enabling intelligent and seamless dynamic channel reconfiguration. Ex 2 R exploits the RSSI values and clear channel assessment (CCA) outputs from the ZigBee radio sampling interface to measure idle-time fractions on candidate WiFi channels, and determines the channel that can provide the highest hotspot capacity. Ex 2 R thus provides a mobile hotspot router accurate information necessary for {{the selection of the}} best channel. We have implemented and evaluated Ex 2 R, demonstrating its effectiveness; Ex 2 R accurately ranks WiFi channels for a mobile hotspot router to dynamically select and switch to the best channel available, thus improving hotspot performance significantly.

PALs are set up at public locations to meet continually changing, multiservice, multi-protocol user requirements. This research investigates the essential infrastructural requirements that will enable further {{proliferation of}} PALs, and consequently facilitate ubiquitous computing. Based on these requirements, an extensible architectural framework for PAL management systems that inherently facilitates the provisioning of multiple services and multiple protocols on PALs is derived. The ensuing framework, which is called Xobogel, is based on the microkernel architectural pattern, and the IPDR (Internet Protocol Data Record) specification. Xobogel takes into consideration and supports the implementation of diverse business models for PALs, in respect of distinct environmental factors. It also facilitates next-generation network service usage accounting through a simple, flexible, and extensible XML based usage record. The framework is subsequently validated for service element extensibility and simplicity through the design, implementation, and experimental deployment of SEHS (Small Extensible <b>Hotspot</b> <b>System),</b> a system based on the framework. The robustness and scalability of the framework is observed to be sufficient for SMME deployment, withstanding the stress testing experiments performed on SEHS.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} part presents the various international organizations {{dealing with the}} security situation in Europe and also the immigration policy of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Immigration policy in Germany is included {{on the grounds that}} in 2015 it was Germany that has become a country facing the greatest influx of migrants, {{to the point where the}} number of registered asylum seekers in the local asylum system exceeded 1 million. Germany, unlike the Czech Republic, has long-term experience in the area of asylum and immigration policy. Moreover, it tries to approach the immigration in a positive way, among others in an effort to fill gaps in the labour market. Germany takes providing assistance to people fleeing war as a moral obligation, and urges other countries to show the same solidarity. As a member state of the European Union and other organizations, the Czech Republic must act according to the rules that international communities enforce, thereby it surrenders, to some extent, its sovereignty when taking the relevant decisions. The aim of present work was to determine threats posed by the acceptance of immigrants and to propose ways to minimize these threats. A secondary aim was to compare the system of refugee reception in the Czech Republic and abroad, particularly in the Land of Bavaria, Germany, that the migration wave in 2015 affected the most of all federal states. In order to obtain the documents necessary to achieve the objectives, we started working with the landlord of an accommodation facility intended for applicants of international protection, in Goldbach (Germany). There we tracked the asylum and integration process of accommodated refugees. To compare the approach in the Czech Republic, we chose the progress and development of the Czech project Generation 21 on the resettlement of Iraqi refugees into the country. Additional information was drawn through lectures and panel discussions with experts on this issue. All the data contributed to answering the research question: whether the strategy of the Czech Republic in terms of receiving refugees has any perspective. The chapter "Results" is devoted to the EU's efforts to create a new, more efficient mechanism that would respond more flexibly than the current system of migration and asylum policy in the EU. In May 2015, the EU submitted to its Member States the "European Programme for Migration", that among others proposed so much publicly discussed mechanism of relocation, resettlement, and <b>hotspot</b> <b>system</b> and return policy. In this case, the work evaluated the proposal, using statistical data obtained from the official databases of the EU, and also thanks to the contribution of Czech experts. In addition, this chapter presents statistical data describing the process of migration waves in 2015, which are interlaced with actual data obtained directly from selected immigrants. The first reference to the applicant for international protection in Germany were foreigners from Iraq and Ethiopia, who, a half a year later, were joined by nationals from Syria. The research at the site showed the real functioning of migration and asylum system. 30 % of all asylum applicants from across the EU headed to Germany. The priority of this country was particularly its asylum policy. The Czech Republic, as a transit country with a share of less than 1 % of applicants, focused on the control of illegal migration. This position was one of the factors that led to the failure of the project Generation 21. In the course of the operation this project resettled 89 refugees from Iraq, more than half of whom then renounced the asylum in order to travel to Germany. It is the secondary movement of immigrants that is threatening the existence of the Schengen area and points out the unsatisfactory effectiveness of the mechanisms proposed by the EU...|$|E
40|$|Deep-Earth {{convection}} can {{be understood}} by studying hotspot volcanoes that form where mantle plumes rise up and intersect the lithosphere, the Earth’s rigid outer layer. Hotspots characteristically leave age-progressive trails of volcanoes and seamounts on top of oceanic lithosphere, which in turn allow us to decipher the motion of these plates relative to “fixed” deep-mantle plumes, and their (isotope) geochemistry provides insights into the long-term evolution of mantle source regions. However, it is strongly suggested that the Hawaiian mantle plume moved ~ 15 ° south between 80 and 50 million years ago. This raises a fundamental question about other <b>hotspot</b> <b>systems</b> in the Pacific, {{whether or not their}} mantle plumes experienced a similar amount and direction of motion. Integrated Ocean Drilling Program(IODP) Expedition 330 to the Louisville Seamounts showed that the Louisville hotspot in the South Pacific behaved in a different manner, as its mantle plume remained more or less fixed around 48 °S latitude during that same time period. Our findings demonstrate thatthe Pacific hotspots move independently and that their trajectories may be controlled by differences in subduction zone geometry. Additionally,shipboard geochemistry data shows that, in contrast to Hawaiian volcanoes, the construction of the Louisville Seamounts doesn’t involve a shield-building phase dominated by tholeiitic lavas,and trace elements confirm the rather homogenous nature of the Louisville mantle source. Both observations set Louisville apart from the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount trail, whereby the latter has been erupting abundant tholeiites (characteristically up to 95 % in volume) and which exhibit a large variability in (isotope) geochemistryand their mantle source components...|$|R

This paper presents DotSlash Qcache services that allow a web site to use on-demand distributed query result caching to greatly reduce the workload at read-mostly databases. The novelty of this work is that our query result caching is on demand and operated based on load conditions, which offers good data consistency for normal load and good scalability with relaxed data consistency under heavy load.
