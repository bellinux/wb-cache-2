25|$|In {{order to}} cope with the extreme altitudes flown at, the pilot was {{provided}} with a specially-developed two-piece suit. This suit, which was principally composed of rubberised fabric, was joined at the waist using a form of pipe-clip. It was provided with a helmet, which featured a large forward window to provide view. It is complete with closed-circuit breathing apparatus, the oxygen jet being delivered via a small injector for circulation purposes. Once exhaled, the gas would travel via an <b>external</b> <b>tube</b> to a canister containing carbon dioxide-absorbing chemicals to restore it to a pure oxygen state prior to being re-circulated. The 138 had an internal capacity of 82 gallons, spread across 70 gallons in the lower tank and 12 gallons in the upper tank. A specially-developed fuel, known as S.A.F.4, was used for the altitude record flight, derived from standard grade Shell Ethyl aviation gasoline. Of note, this fuel has a high anti-knock value; the high degree of supercharge involved results in the fuel mixture reaching high temperatures, which generally increases the potential for detonation, thus a high anti-knock value was viewed to be of critical importance.|$|E
500|$|The {{scientific}} name Asteroidea {{was given to}} starfish by the French zoologist de Blainville in 1830. It {{is derived from the}} Greek aster, ἀστήρ (a star) and the Greek eidos, εἶδος (form, likeness, appearance). The class Asteroidea belongs to the phylum Echinodermata. As well as the starfish, the echinoderms include sea urchins, sand dollars, brittle and basket stars, sea cucumbers and crinoids. The larvae of echinoderms have bilateral symmetry, but during metamorphosis this is replaced with radial symmetry, typically pentameric. [...] Adult echinoderms are characterized by having a water vascular system with <b>external</b> <b>tube</b> feet and a calcareous endoskeleton consisting of ossicles connected by a mesh of collagen fibres. Starfish are included in the subphylum Asterozoa, the characteristics of which include a flattened, star-shaped body as adults consisting of a central disc and multiple radiating arms. The subphylum includes the two classes of Asteroidea, the starfish, and Ophiuroidea, the brittle stars and basket stars. Asteroids have broad-based arms with skeletal support provided by calcareous plates in the body wall while ophiuroids have clearly demarcated slender arms strengthened by paired fused ossicles forming jointed [...] "vertebrae".|$|E

40|$|Two {{new species}} of the diatom genus Cyclostephanos Round are {{described}} from Pliocene fossil deposits in western North America. Cyclostephanos undatus is distinguished from other Cyclostephanos species by its tangentially undulate valve face; Cyclostephanos fenestratus is distinguished by its extremely shallow alveoli. This paper records previously unreported morphological detail of Cyclostephanos and speculates that structure of the punctum, labiate process and strutted process may enhance diagnosis of the freshwater genera of the Thalassiosiraceae Lebour emend. Hasle. Cyclostephanos undatus is similar to several Cyclotella species, but its external costae are raised and its alveolar morphology {{is similar to that}} of Cyclostephanos dubius (Fricke) Round. Cyclostephanos fenestratus is similar in external view to Stephanodiscus Ehrenb.

From August 1912 until first discontinued by Winchester in May 1964, nearly two million Model 12 shotguns were produced in various grades and barrel lengths. Initially chambered for 20 gauge only, the 12 and 16 gauge versions came out in 1913 (first listed in the 1914 catalogs), and the 28 gauge version came out in 1934.

5000|$|Along {{with the}} {{chordates}} and hemichordates, echinoderms are deuterostomes, {{one of the}} two major divisions of the bilaterians, the other being the protostomes. During the early development of the embryo, in deuterostomes, the blastopore (the first opening to form) becomes the anus whereas in the protostomes, it becomes the mouth. In deuterostomes, the mouth develops at a later stage, {{at the opposite end of}} the blastula from the blastopore, and a gut forms connecting the two. The larvae of echinoderms have bilateral symmetry but this is lost during metamorphosis when their bodies are reorganised and develop the characteristic radial symmetry of the echinoderm, typically pentamerism. [...] The characteristics of adult echinoderms are the possession of a water vascular system with <b>external</b> <b>tube</b> feet and a calcareous endoskeleton consisting of ossicles connected by a mesh of collagen fibres.|$|E

50|$|Early submarines, {{when they}} carried torpedoes, were {{fitted with a}} variety of torpedo {{launching}} mechanisms in a range of locations; on the deck, in the bow or stern, amidships, with some launch mechanisms permitting the torpedo to be aimed over a wide arc. By World War 2, designs favoured multiple bow tubes and fewer or no stern tubes. Modern submarine bows are usually occupied by a large sonar array, necessitating midships tubes angled outward, while stern tubes have largely disappeared. The first French and Russian submarines carried their torpedoes externally in Drzewiecki drop collars. These were cheaper than tubes, but less reliable. Both the United Kingdom and United States experimented with <b>external</b> <b>tubes</b> in World War II. <b>External</b> <b>tubes</b> offered a cheap and easy way of increasing torpedo capacity without radical redesign, something neither had time or resources to do prior to, or early in, the war. British T class submarines carried up to 13 torpedo tubes, up to 5 of them external. America's use was mainly limited to earlier Porpoise-, Salmon-, and Sargo-class boats. Until the appearance of the Tambor, most American submarines only carried 4 bow and either 2 or 4 stern tubes, something many American submarine officers felt provided inadequate firepower. This problem was compounded by the notorious unreliability of the Mark 14 torpedo.|$|R
40|$|Myxozoans {{belonging}} to the recently described class Malacosporea parasitize freshwater bryozoans during {{at least part of}} their life cycle. There are at present only two species described in this class: Buddenbrockia plumatellae and Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae. The former can exist as vermiform and sac-like stages in bryozoan hosts. The latter, in addition to forming sac-like stages in bryozoans, is the causative agent of salmonid proliferative kidney disease (PKD). We undertook molecular and ultrastructural investigations of new malacosporean material to further resolve malacosporean diversity and systematics. Phylogenetic analyses of 18 S rDNA sequences provided evidence for two new putative species {{belonging to}} the genus Buddenbrockia, revealing a two-fold increase in the diversity of malacosporeans known to date. One new malacosporean is a vermiform parasite infecting the bryozoan Fredericella sultana and the other occurs as sac-like stages in the rare bryozoan, Lophopus crystallinus. Both bryozoans represent new hosts for the genus Buddenbrockia. Our results have established that the malacosporean which infected F. sultana was not a vermiform stage of T. bryosalmonae, although it was collected from a site endemic for PKD.
