40|$|Managing a large {{communication}} network {{is a complex}} task handled {{by a group of}} human operators.

After detecting and troubleshooting a problem, they may change the configuration of the equipment to improve the utilization of network resources and the performance experienced by end users. The ability to detect, diagnose, and fix problems depends on the information available from the underlying network. These tasks are easier if the equipment provides reliable and predictable service and retains detailed information about the resources consumed by the ongoing data transfers.

50|$|The {{original}} Box was a robot {{which was}} controlled by human wearing a special neural interface helmet.

5000|$|Remote sensing from {{aircraft}} and satellites. High resolution optical mapping, thermal imaging and hyperspectral data play a role. Underground coal fires {{of several hundred}} to over a thousand degrees Celsius may raise the surface temperature by only a few degrees. This order of magnitude {{is similar to the}} temperature difference between the sunlit and shadowed slopes of a slag heap or sand dune. Infrared <b>detecting</b> <b>equipment</b> is able to track the fire's location as the fire heats the ground on all sides of it. However, remote sensing techniques are unable to distinguish individual fires burning near one another and often lead to undercounting of actual fires. They may also have some difficulties distinguishing coal seam fires from forest fires. Combining in-situ data with remote sensing data does allow for monitoring of coal fire intensity over longer periods of time using time-series analyses.|$|E

40|$|A new {{generation}} of Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) for building automation systems is needed to allow facility managers to leverage the potential of advanced controls and diagnostics. In this paper we describe a design process and the end product, a novel HMI prototype and the system that supports it. The system is an integration of advanced algorithms, an underlying software architecture, building equipment, and the human operators that use it. Recent developments in building controls and diagnostics techniques promise to improve occupants comfort while minimizing energy consumption. Advanced diagnostics algorithms can <b>detect</b> <b>equipment</b> failures and anomalous behaviors, while also estimating the energy and comfort impact of faults disrupting normal operation. New sophisticated control schemes can regulate a building based on past and future conditions rather than a static model. These control schemes can also automatically adapt to equipment failures, thereby maintaining the highest comfort given the available resources. There are several hurdles that must be overcome to effectively deploy these technologies. The perceived algorithmic difficulty of these approaches {{and the absence of}} proper tools to leverage them create a gap between what we know is computationally possible and operators in the field. One of the biggest problems is that current Building Management Systems (BMS) are not designed to natively support these advanced capabilities even if they were commercially deployable today...|$|R
40|$|Since 1985, {{researchers}} at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have developed and patented several novel signal conditioning and signature analysis methods that have exploited the intrinsic abilities of conventional electric motors and generators to act as transducers. By using simple nonintrusive sensors such as clamp-on current and voltage probes, these new diagnostic techniques provide an improved means of detecting small time-dependent load and speed variations generated anywhere within an electromechanical system and converting them into revealing signatures {{that can be used}} to <b>detect</b> <b>equipment</b> degradation and incipient failures. These developments have been grouped under the general name of electrical signature analysis (ESA) and together provide a breakthrough in the ability to detect, analyze, and correct unwanted changes in process conditions or the presence of abnormalities in electrical and electromechanical equipment. Typical diagnostic information provided by ESA is comparable to that provided by conventional vibration analysis in that both time waveform and frequency spectrum signatures may be produced. The primary benefit of ESA is that an extensive range of diagnostic information can be obtained from a single transducer that may be installed several hundred feet or more from the monitored device on its electrical lines supplying input power (e. g., to a motor) or carrying output power (e. g., from a generator); thus, ESA is truly remote and nonintrusive...|$|R
