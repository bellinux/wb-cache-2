25|$|The Ames Arc Jet Complex is an {{advanced}} thermophysics facility where sustained hypersonic- and hyperthermal testing of vehicular thermoprotective systems takes place under {{a variety of}} simulated flight- and re-entry conditions. Of its seven available test bays, four currently contain Arc Jet units of differing configurations, serviced by common facility support equipment. These are the Aerodynamic Heating Facility (AHF), the Turbulent Flow Duct (TFD), the Panel Test Facility (PTF), and the Interaction Heating Facility (IHF). The support equipment includes two D.C. power supplies, a steam ejector-driven vacuum system, a water-cooling system, high-pressure gas systems, <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>system,</b> and other auxiliary systems.|$|E
25|$|An {{advantage}} of DFAT testing over reverberant testing is the portability of the DFAT system. This allows {{the test equipment}} to be transported to any location, setup, calibrated, used to perform a High Intensity Acoustic Test and then removed from the test site. The entire process from load-in to load-out can be accomplished in no more than 4 days for a large satellite or similar aerospace structure. The test system uses a “building block” approach to form combinations of equipment to satisfy the environmental requirements. Systems typically include 500 plus speakers, 2 million plus watts of amplification, at least 8 to 16 control microphones, and a closed-loop MIMO acoustic control and <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>system.</b> The mobility and “building block” approach allows this method to be tailored for each application {{and to provide a}} more timely and cost effective test solution.

40|$|Because {{of their}} {{performance}} characteristics high-performance fabrics like Infiniband or OmniPath are interesting technologies for many local area network applications, including <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>systems</b> for high-energy physics experiments like the ATLAS experiment at CERN. This paper analyzes existing APIs for high-performance fabrics and evaluates their suitability for <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>systems</b> in terms of performance and domain applicability. The study finds that existing software APIs for high-performance interconnects are focused on applications in high-performance computing with specific workloads and are not compatible {{with the requirements of}} <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>systems.</b> To evaluate the use of high-performance interconnects in <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>systems</b> a custom library, NetIO, is presented and compared against existing technologies. NetIO has a message queue-like interface which matches the ATLAS use case better than traditional HPC APIs like MPI. The architecture of NetIO is based on a interchangeable back-end system with which different interconnects can be supported. A libfabric-based back-end supports a wide range of fabric technologies including Infiniband. On the front-end side NetIO supports several high-level communication patterns that are found in typical <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> applications like client/server and publish/subscribe. Unlike other frameworks NetIO distinguishes between high-throughput and low-latency communication, which is essential for applications with heterogeneous traffic patterns like <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>systems.</b> Benchmarks of NetIO in comparison with the message queue implementation ZeroMQ are presented. NetIO reaches up to 2 x higher throughput than ZeroMQ on Ethernet and higher throughput on FDR Infiniband. Latencies are competitive in comparison with ZeroMQ...|$|R
