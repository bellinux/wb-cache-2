40|$|Understanding the {{processes}} that control the inter-annual variability of Arctic total ozone during winter and spring is important to predict how the ozone layer will evolve in the coming decades. It is now well accepted that high latitude total ozone during spring is largely controlled by the flux of planetary-scale waves into the stratosphere during mid-winter, {{as measured by the}} Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux. E. g., years with low wave activity during mid-winter exhibit reduced poleward and <b>downward</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>transport,</b> enhanced confinement of air masses at high latitudes and low temperatures that favour chemical ozone destruction. Here we now show that the inter-annual variability of Arctic total ozone during March is highly correlated with high latitude ozone in the mid-stratosphere during the previous summer and autumn. This raises the question of what controls the stratospheric inter-annual variability during winter and spring. Inter-annual variability in polar ozon...|$|E
40|$|We use a {{three-dimensional}} chemical transport model {{to examine the}} shortwave radiative effects of clouds on the tropospheric ozone budget. In addition to looking at changes in global concentrations as previous studies have done, we examine changes in ozone chemical production and loss caused by clouds and how these vary {{in different parts of}} the troposphere. On a global scale, we find that clouds have a modest effect on ozone chemistry, but on a regional scale their role is much more significant, with the size of the response dependent on the region. The largest averaged changes in chemical budgets (&plusmn; 10 – 14 %) are found in the marine troposphere, where cloud optical depths are high. We demonstrate that cloud effects are small on average in the middle troposphere because this is a transition region between reduction and enhancement in photolysis rates. We show that increases in boundary layer ozone due to clouds are driven by large-scale changes in <b>downward</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>transport</b> from higher in the troposphere rather than by decreases in in-situ ozone chemical loss rates. Increases in upper tropospheric ozone are caused by higher production rates due to backscattering of radiation and consequent increases in photolysis rates, mainly J(NO 2 ). The global radiative effect of clouds on isoprene is stronger than on ozone. Tropospheric isoprene lifetime increases by 7 % when taking clouds into account. We compare the importance of clouds in contributing to uncertainties in the global ozone budget with the role of other radiatively-important factors. The budget is most sensitive to the overhead ozone column, while surface albedo and clouds have smaller effects. However, uncertainty in representing the spatial distribution of clouds may lead to a large sensitivity on regional scales...|$|E
40|$|We use the stratospheric/tropospheric {{chemical}} transport model MOZART- 3 {{to study the}} distribution and transport of stratospheric O 3 during the remarkable stratospheric sudden warming event observed in January 2004 in the northern polar region. A comparison between observations by the MIPAS instrument on board the ENVISAT spacecraft and model simulations shows that {{the evolution of the}} polar vortex and of planetary waves during the warming event {{plays an important role in}} controlling the spatial distribution of stratospheric ozone and the downward ozone flux in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere (UTLS) region. Compared to the situation during the winter of 2002 – 2003, lower ozone concentrations were transported from the polar region to mid-latitudes, leading to exceptional large areas of low ozone concentrations outside the polar vortex and "low-ozone pockets" in the middle stratosphere. The unusually long-lasting stratospheric westward winds (easterlies) during the 2003 – 2004 event greatly restricted the upward propagation of planetary waves, causing the weak transport of ozone-rich air originated from low latitudes to the middle polar stratosphere (30 km). The restricted wave activities led to a reduced extratropical downward ozone flux from the lower stratosphere to the lowermost stratosphere (or from the "overworld" into the "middleworld"), especially over East Asia. Consequently, during wintertime (15 December~ 15 February), the total <b>downward</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>transport</b> on 100 hPa surface by the descending branches of Brewer-Dobson circulation over this region was about 10 % lower during the 2003 – 2004 event. Meanwhile, the extratropical total cross-tropopause ozone flux (CTOF) was also reduced by ~ 25 %. Compared to the cold 1999 – 2000 winter, the vertical CTOF in high latitudes (60 °~ 90 ° N) increased more than 10 times during the two warming winters, while the vertical CTOF in mid-latitudes (30 °~ 60 ° N) decreased by 20 ~ 40 %.

40|$|International audienceIt {{is shown}} with a {{numerical}} simulation that a {{sharp increase in}} the vertical temperature gradient and Brunt-Väisälä frequency near the tropopause may produce an increase in the amplitudes of internal gravity waves (IGWs) propagating upward from the troposphere, wave breaking and generation of stronger turbulence.

Turbulent diffusion coefficient calculated numerically and measured with the MU radar are of 1 - 10 m 2 /s in different seasons in Shigaraki, Japan (35 ° N, 136 ° E).

In this budget analysis, the chemical net production term, which is calculated as the residual of the other terms, displays the correct features of a chemical sink and source term, including location and seasonality, and shows good agreement in magnitude compared to other methods of calculating ozone loss rates. This study provides further insight {{into the role of}} the eddy <b>ozone</b> <b>transport</b> and underlines its fundamental role in the recovery of the ozone hole during spring. The trend analysis reveals that the ozone hole intensification over the 1980 – 2001 period is not solely related to the trend in chemical losses, but more specifically to the balance between the trends in chemical losses and <b>ozone</b> <b>transport.</b> That is because, in the Southern Hemisphere from October to December, the large increase in the chemical destruction of ozone is balanced by an equally large trend in the eddy transport, associated with a small increase in the mean transport.

This climatology provides a state-of-the-art quantification of the geographical distribution of STE and the preferred transport pathways, as well as insight into the temporal evolution of STE during the last 33 yr. We confirm the distinct zonal and seasonal asymmetry found in previous studies using comparable methods. The subset of "deep STE", where stratospheric air reaches the PBL within 4 days or vice versa, shows especially strong geographical and seasonal variations. The global hotspots for deep STE are found along the west coast of North America and over the Tibetan Plateau, especially in boreal winter and spring. An analysis of the time series reveals significant positive trends of the net downward mass flux and of deep STE in both directions, which are particularly large over North America. The <b>downward</b> <b>ozone</b> flux across the tropopause is dominated by the seasonal cycle of ozone concentrations at the tropopause and peaks in summer, when the mass flux is nearly at its minimum.

The isoline of ozone mixing ratio of 40 nmol/mol moved by 5. 0 km downward from 17. 8 km to 12. 8 km, while the tropopause height was 16. 2 – 17. 8 km throughout the period.

Based on trajectory analyses and temperature histories, these two types were usually formed respectively by: (1) in situ cooling on both a synoptic scale and mesoscale; and (2) recent (a few days) outflow from convection. There is evidence from one case that the thicker clouds can also be formed by in situ cooling.

When the Lagrangian mean advection is approximated by the residual circulation, errors in the transport velocities as large as 30 pct may occur...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{method of}} calculating the <b>downward</b> <b>ozone</b> flux across the midlatitude (30 deg- 60 deg) {{tropopause}} shows the Northern Hemisphere (NH) ozone flux {{to be significantly}} larger (approximately 24 %) than that calculated in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) during the year 2000. This diagnostic method {{makes it possible to}} separate dynamical aspects of transport from the seasonal cycle of ozone in the lowermost stratosphere and explain the hemispheric difference in the ozone flux. The SH total horizontal area of exchange is equal to or slightly greater than the area of exchange in the NH throughout an annual cycle. The mean changes in potential vorticity of parcels near the tropopause are also similar or slightly greater in the SH, suggesting that NH and SH downward total mass transport to the troposphere are comparable. These results imply that the greater NH ozone flux is mostly due to the amount of ozone available for exchange rather than net hemispheric dynamical differences near the tropopause level...|$|R
