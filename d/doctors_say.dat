5|$|After {{being shot}} in the head during the {{previous}} episode, Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) has had a miraculous recovery and will live, although <b>doctors</b> <b>say</b> he will be blind all his life. Crosetti (Jon Polito) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) question prime suspect Alfred Smith (Mojo Gentry), who was identified by eyewitness Charles Flavin (Larry Hull) as the shooter. Crosetti, a close personal friend of Thormann, is convinced Smith is the shooter, but Lewis insists on further investigation. Lewis later learns Flavin bragged about shooting a cop the day Thormann was shot. Crosetti confronts Flavin, who nonchalantly admits to shooting Thormann in frustration because Flavin was suffering a migraine. Although the police celebrate finding Thormann's shooter, Lewis comforts a guilt-stricken Crosetti, who feels he took the case too personally and almost let the true shooter go free.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>doctors</b> <b>say</b> an {{advantage}} to stereotactic treatments is that they deliver {{the right amount of}} radiation to the cancer in a shorter amount of time than traditional treatments, which can often take 6 to 11 weeks. Plus treatments are given with extreme accuracy, which should limit the effect of the radiation on healthy tissues. One problem with stereotactic treatments is that they are only suitable for certain small tumors.|$|E

500|$|Mario Scaramella : The United Kingdom's Health Protection Agency (HPA) {{announced}} that significant quantities of polonium-210 {{had been found}} in Mario Scaramella although his health was found to be normal. He was admitted to hospital for tests and monitoring. <b>Doctors</b> <b>say</b> that Scaramella was exposed to a much lower level of polonium-210 than Litvinenko, and that preliminary tests found [...] "no evidence of radiation toxicity". According to the 6pm Channel 4 news (9 December 2006) the intake of polonium he suffered would only result in a dose of 1 mSv. This would lead to a 1 in 20,000 chance of cancer. According to The Independent, Scaramella alleged that Litvinenko was involved in smuggling radioactive material to Zürich in 2000.|$|E
500|$|In early 2011, Hanneman {{contracted}} necrotizing fasciitis. According to the band, <b>doctors</b> <b>say</b> that {{it likely}} originated from a spider bite. Araya said of Hanneman's condition: [...] "Jeff was seriously ill. Jeff ended up contracting a bacteria that ate away his flesh on his arm, so they cut open his arm, from his wrist to his shoulder, {{and they did}} a skin graft on him, they cleaned up ... It was a flesh-eating virus, so he was really, really bad. So we'll {{wait for him to}} get better, and when he's a hundred percent, he's gonna come out and join us." [...] The band decided to play their upcoming tour dates without Hanneman. Gary Holt of Exodus was announced as Hanneman's temporary replacement. Cannibal Corpse guitarist Pat O'Brien filled in for Holt during a tour in Europe. On April 23, 2011, at the American Big 4 show in Indio, California, Hanneman rejoined his bandmates to play the final two songs of their set, [...] "South of Heaven" [...] and [...] "Angel of Death."This was Hanneman's final live performance with the band.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} that Pausch gave the lecture, he was a {{pancreatic}} cancer patient. In an interview, Pausch stated that he had felt bloated, and learned {{that he had a}} cancerous tumor when doctors performed a CT Scan to check for gallstones. He then underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy surgery (or the [...] "Whipple procedure") to try to stop the growth of the cancerous tumor in his body, which later proved to be unsuccessful. The doctors removed his gall bladder, parts of his small intestine, a third of his pancreas, and parts of his stomach, and proceeded to begin an experimental radiation treatment that could possibly increase his chances of survival for another 5 years to 45 percent. Pausch began the radiation treatments in November 2006 and stopped in May 2007, and felt that he was in good health after finishing. In July and August, tests conducted at Johns Hopkins University showed that Pausch was free of cancer. However, in late August of that year, Pausch informed readers of his website that his cancer had returned, saying: [...] "A recent CT scan showed that there are 10 tumors in my liver, and my spleen is also peppered with small tumors. The <b>doctors</b> <b>say</b> that {{it is one of the}} most aggressive recurrences they have ever seen." [...] The doctors estimated Pausch had three to six months of good health left to live.|$|E
500|$|But {{there was}} also {{speculation}} over how long Reagan had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration. Not long after the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, at a reception for mayors, Reagan greeted his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce in 1981 by saying [...] "How are you, Mr Mayor? How are things in your city?" [...] Former CBS White House correspondent Lesley Stahl recounted that, in her final {{meeting with the president}} in 1986, Reagan did not seem to know who Stahl was, and that she came close to reporting that Reagan was senile, {{but at the end of}} the meeting, Reagan had regained his alertness. However, Dr. Lawrence K. Altman, a physician employed as a reporter for The New York Times, noted that [...] "the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of Alzheimer's can be fuzzy," [...] and all four of Reagan's White House doctors said that they saw no evidence of Alzheimer's while he was president. Dr. John E. Hutton, Reagan's primary physician from 1984 to 1989, said the president [...] "absolutely" [...] did not [...] "show any signs of dementia or Alzheimer's." [...] His former Chief of Staff James Baker considered [...] "ludicrous" [...] the idea that Reagan slept during cabinet meetings. Other staff members, former aides, and friends said they saw no indication of Alzheimer's while he was president. Reagan did experience occasional memory lapses, though, especially with names. Reagan's <b>doctors</b> <b>say</b> that he only began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992 or 1993, several years after he had left office. For example, Reagan repeated a toast to Margaret Thatcher, with identical words and gestures, at his 82nd-birthday party on February 6, 1993.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{tend to view}} {{efforts to}} reduce medical {{services}} as [...] "healthcare rationing in the United States". Since doctors {{do not want to}} be seen as withholding care, they are hesitant to change established behavior in any way that lessens the amount of treatment they order. <b>Doctors</b> <b>say</b> that they often feel pressure to engage in defensive medicine by conducting extra testing to avoid lawsuits.|$|E
