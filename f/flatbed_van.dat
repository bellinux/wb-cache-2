40|$|Stationary, {{axisymmetric}} and asymptotically flat spacetimes of dust {{of which}} trajectories are integral curves {{of the time}} translation Killing vector are investigated. The flow has no Newtonian limit. Asymptotic flatness implies the existence of singularities of the curvature scalar that are distributions and that are not isolated from regularity regions of the flow.

By combining a controlled analytical approach with large-scale numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the weak-coupling instabilities of the Kondo-lattice model lead to exotic magnetic orderings.

60|$|Going {{quietly to}} the {{apparatus}} above referred to, the junior sorter {{looked out at}} the window and lowered the net, which, instead of lying <b>flat</b> against the <b>van,</b> now projected upwards of three feet from it. As he did so something flashed about his feet. He leaped aside and gave a shout. Fearful live creatures were sometimes sent by post, he knew, and serpents had been known before that to take an airing in Post-Office vans {{as well as in the}} great sorting-room of St. Martin's-le-Grand! A snake had only a short time before been observed at large on the floor of one of the night mail sorting carriages on the London and North-Western Railway, which, after a good deal of confusion and interruption to the work, was killed. This flashed into his mind, but the moment was critical, and the junior sorter had no time to indulge in private little weaknesses. Duty required prompt action.|$|R
40|$|The GEWEX Atmospheric Boundary-Layer Study (GABLS) {{focus on}} the {{representation}} of stable boundary layers in atmospheric models (Holtslag, 2006). One of the main goals of GABLS {{is to provide a}} mondial platform for the atmospheric boundary layer research community through the organisation of model intercomparisons. Here we focus on single column models (SCM's), which can be both research models and SCM's derived from operational weather and climate models. Two SCM intercomparison case studies have been performed so far. One highly idealised case over snow with prescribed surface temperature (Cuxart et al., 2006) and a second case based on observations taken during the CASES 99 stable boundary layer experiment also with prescribed surface temperature (Svensson and Holtslag, 2007). In these studies it was found that especially the complexity of real world boundary conditions and the lack of interaction with the surface makes it difficult to confront the models with observed evaluation parameters. A reasonable ideal case was found in the long observational dataset of the meteorological site Cabauw in the Netherlands (Baas et al., 2008). To make comparison with observations possible care was taken to prescribe realistic advective tendency terms to the SCM's (Bosveld et al., 2008). These were estimated from both local observations and hind casts of several 3 D NWP models. The specific characteristics of the Cabauw site with its <b>flat</b> topography (<b>van</b> Ulden and Wieringa, 1995; Beljaars and Bosveld, 1997) makes it well suited to study decoupling around sunset, inertial oscillation and low level jet and the morning time transition to convective conditions (Angevine et al. 2002). Preliminary results will be presented of an intercomparison between SCM's and an evaluation of the models with observations from the Cabauw site. Special attention in this study is on the moment of decoupling around sunset, the inertial oscillation and the morning time transition...|$|R
50|$|Early wagons {{were built}} on four wheeled under frames, but from 1871 bogie {{vehicles}} begun to appear. These early wagons were of all wood construction, but later types had wooden bodies on steel underframes, then followed by all steel wagons. Groups of wagons {{of the same}} design are classed together by a multiple character alphabetical code, initially in a system restricted to Victoria only, but from 1979 the Railways of Australia four letter coding was introduced. Under this system the first letter represent owner of the wagon, the second represents the general type of wagon, the third separates different classes of the same general type, and the four letter indicates the maximum running speed. The last four wheeled open wagons were built in 1958, but were not scrapped in large numbers until the 1980s when new bogie wagons replaced them.

50|$|In 1940, Brush {{required}} {{some small}} battery-electric tractor units, but as none were commercially available, they asked AC Morrison of AE Morrison and Sons (later Morrison-Electricar) {{to produce a}} design for one. Morrisons produced a 3-wheeled design, which Brush then used to manufacture a number of units for internal use. Subsequently, they began selling them on the open market, and shipped a large order to Russia in 1941. They added battery electric road vehicles to their product list in 1945, buying the designs and manufacturing rights from Metropolitan Vickers, so that early Brush vehicles are almost indistinguishable from late Metro-Vicks. 3-wheeled vehicles were marketed as the Brush Pony, and they also produced 4-wheeled vehicles. In 1948 they added a 2-ton chassis to their range, which could be supplied with a large <b>van,</b> standard <b>van,</b> <b>flat</b> truck or milk float body. The welded box-section chassis was fitted with semielliptic springs and a Lockhead hydraulic braking system. The 36-cell 290 Ahr battery was mounted {{on both sides of}} the central spine. The electric motor was connected to a banjo-type rear axle by a Layrub propellor shaft. In common with other Brush vehicles, control was by a double-depression foot pedal, where the first depression gave two stages of control with the two halves of the battery connected in parallel, and the second depression gave a further two stages with the batteries in series.|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of subaqueous slopes is often studied {{to determine the}} probability of failure of hydraulic structures. Slope failures have been widely studied to increase the understanding of this complex failure mechanism. However, after a failure it is often {{hard to figure out}} the type of failure mechanism: static liquefaction or breach flow. Densely packed soil show dilatant behavior when its subjected to shear, and therefore its stability is temporarily guaranteed. The slope gradual loses grains, which may initiate turbidity currents. This current can be accelerated over the entire slope, until far downstream the flow decelerates (decreased gravitational force and the bed friction) and settles eventually. 1 D-equations are derived from conservation of mass and momentum along slopes, which results in an adaptation with respect to the equations of Mastbergen (2013) in the model HMBreach, namely the system is extended to non-stationary conditions. The 1 D equations are the framework of the numerical model: BreachFlow. A first order upwind scheme is applied and the transition equations from Eke, Viparelli, & Parker (2011) form the boundary at the breach. This boundary provides initial conditions of thickness, velocity and density and are based on breach height, like in HMBreach and therefore change when the breach retrogrades in time. Due to the chosen numerical scheme hydraulic jumps cause errors when super critical flows decelerate and become sub-critical. Therefore, sedimentation cannot be modelled and the final slope is not found. However, several time steps at the toe of the breach can be modelled and provide information about the development of the breach height, which is important for the initial condition at the first grid point. In conclusion, with BreachFlow is not yet possible to model the entire final slope, when the breach height reduces to zero. However, it is compared to HMBreach/HMTurb and Retrobreach a promising model, which is easy to adapt to different parameters (including profile) and more accurate regarding the calculation of three variables instead of one (transport of sand). Future work should be based on the implementation of a higher order explicit scheme or even an implicit scheme, in order to model the sedimentation. Then the model can be compared to several case studies including tidal <b>flat</b> of Walsoorden (<b>Van</b> den Ham et al, 2015) in order gain insight what type of mechanism occurred and what parameters correspond to the final slope and retrogressive length.
