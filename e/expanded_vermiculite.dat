40|$|The biotite {{in parts}} of the Bald Mountain bathol ith in northeastern Oregon has been vermiculitized, {{probably}} through the action of weathering. In the present investigation, samples from only one small area within the bath-olith were studied in the laboratory, but spot field tests show that biotite of other exposures of the batholith several miles distant is similarly altered. The matter was originally brought to our attention by Clinton P. Haight of Baker, Oregon, who found that when mica in the area of this study was heated it <b>expanded</b> like <b>vermiculite.</b> The name "vermiculite " is probably derived from the Latin word vermi-culus, which is the diminutive of vermes, meaning "worm. " This refers to the curvy, worm-like appearance of the mica on expansion, which can be produced from the heat of a match. This simple field test, which mayyield expa~sions of greater than 20 percent, is sometimes used to classify mica as a vermicul ite. The name is also used more strictly for a mineral species which appears to be a mica but which contains a relatively large amountof water in its structure and no K 20. The Oregon material discussed here qual-ifies as a vermiculite only in the first sense, as an expanding material. It is not a true vermiculite mineralogically. Vermiculites occur in three types of rocks: (1) ultrabasic or basic, such as pyroxenites, serpentines, and dunites; (2) meta[TJorphic, such as schists, gneisses, and marbles; and (3) granitic rocks.

In {{the presence of}} montmorillonite and <b>vermiculite,</b> <b>expanding</b> clays with high cation-exchange-capacity (CEC), nitrite yield was increased, ammonia oxidation continued at pH values below those which inhibited growth {{in the absence of}} clays and growth was biphasic.

Illite, a non-expanding clay with low CEC, had no significant effect on ammonia oxidation, while oxidation of ammonia-treated vermiculite (ATV) occurred with no significant change in the pH of the medium. ATV, montmorillonite and vermiculite, but not illite, protected cells from inhibition by nitrapyrin at concentrations inhibitory to cells growing in suspended culture. This protection was maintained in ATV homo-ionic to A 13 +, but montmorillonite made homo-ionic to A 13 + did not provide protection from inhibition.

40|$|Abstract: The {{demand for}} the {{development}} of underground spaces has been sharply increased in lieu of saturated ground spaces because the residents of cities have steadily increased since the 1980 s. The traditional widely used excavation methods (i. e., explosion and shield) have caused many problems, such as noise, vibration, extended schedule, and increased costs. The vibration-free (and explosion-free) excavation method has currently attracted attention in the construction site because of the advantage of definitively solving these issues. For such reason, a new excavation method that utilizes the expansion of vermiculite with relatively fewer defects is proposed in this study. In general, vermiculite materials are rapidly expanded in volume when they receive thermal energy. Expansion pressure can be produced by thermal expansion of vermiculite in a steel tube, and measured by laboratory tests. The experimental tests are performed with various influencing parameters in an effort to seek the optimal condition to effectively increase expansion pressure at the same temperature. Then, calibrated expansion pressure is estimated, and compared to each model. After analyzing test results for expansion pressure, it is verified that <b>vermiculite</b> <b>expanded</b> by heat can provide enough internal pressure to break hard rock during tunneling work...|$|R

In case of facing of gas-concrete blocks with the grade D 500 using plaster mortars with the density 1400 … 1600 km/m 3 there occurs a dismatch in the values of thermal insulation and vapor permeability of the plaster and base. The authors suggest using dry mortars for finishing of gas-concrete block of the grades D 500 и D 600, which allow obtaining facing thermal insulating coatings. The efficiency of using four different high-porous additives in the lime dry mortar was compared. They were: hollow glass microspheres, aluminosilicate ash microspheres, <b>expanded</b> <b>vermiculite</b> sand, expanded pearlitic sand. The high efficiency of hollow glass microspheres in heat insulating finishing mortars compared to other fillers is proved...|$|E
40|$|Polymeric {{materials}} are increasingly used in several applications. However, their relatively high flammability presents {{a danger to}} people and property. Their use therefore requires that they are made more resistant to both the initiation and propagation of fires. Vermiculite is a fire-resistant material which can be utilised as a flame retardant (FR) additive in polymers. Industrial expansion of natural vermiculite is made at temperatures above 800 °C. However, vermiculite’s expansion onset temperature is around 450 °C and effective FR additives have their onset temperatures {{in the range of}} 200 to 350 °C. With the aim of resolving this disparity, Palabora vermiculite was modified by different procedures and methods to render it more suitable for its application in flame-retarded LLDPE, PU and PVC polymer composites. Palabora vermiculite was modified using inorganic cations, urea complexes and organic surfactants. Urea complexes and some organic surfactants reduced vermiculite’s expansion onset temperature, but did not significantly affect its maximum expansion ratio. The latter was found to be independent of the flake thickness {{and the nature of the}} modification. Application of a compressive force sufficient to compact an <b>expanded</b> worm-like <b>vermiculite</b> flake reconstituted the vermicular structure to the original dimensions. At low compressive forces the vermicular structure showed spring-like behaviour with hysteresis. The interlayer mosaic-like bonding holds the sheets together and stabilises the system via mechanical interconnects that prevent complete expansion or exfoliation. In this work the expansion onset temperature of vermiculite was successfully tuned to within the activation temperature range of intumescent systems (209  35 C) through the intercalation of metal-urea complexes. These complexes feature both urea and water molecules as blowing agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that vermiculite’s exfoliation onset temperature has been lowered to such temperatures, using ion-exchange methods and specifically urea complexes. The organic intercalation was successful and was restricted to the ion-exchange level, despite vermiculite’s pre-treatment with Na+ ions. The d-spacing values were proportional to the surfactant’s chain length. These values also increased with increasing surfactant:vermiculite ratio up to ca. 150 % CEC and assumed an average value of 4. 4 nm. All organo-vermiculite/LLDPE composites were translucent. Their XRD diffractograms were featureless, suggesting excellent dispersion throughout the matrix. However, the presence of mica agglomerates was detected. The organo-vermiculite improved significantly LLDPE’s mechanical and flammability properties. In PU composites the urea-vermiculite was unable to form a cohesive protective barrier layer during the cone calorimeter test. The poor compatibility between the molten PU and the exfoliated flakes also led to the consumption of the underlying PU. Nevertheless, the addition of urea-vermiculite lowered significantly the pHRR of PU composites. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015. tm 2015 ChemistryPhDUnrestricte...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{chemical}} vapor deposition using ethanol and FeMo catalysts at 600, 700, 800 and 900 °C {{was used}} to modify the surface of <b>expanded</b> <b>vermiculite</b> (EV). Scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Mössbauer spectra, N 2 -BET surface areas, and carbon elemental analyses suggested that the FeMo catalyst promoted 2 – 3 % growth of carbon in different forms, mainly nanofibers, on the EV surface. The amount of 2 – 3 % carbon produced by ethanol/CVD process on EV produced a 500 % increase in the absorption of soybean, diesel and engine oil, with a concomitant decrease on water absorption. These results were {{discussed in terms of}} a hydrophobization of the EV surface by the carbon structures and a “sponge-like” effect due to the entangled nanofibers structure, as it was observed by microscopy, and an increase of N 2 -BET surface area from 3 m 2 g− 1 for EV up to 21 m 2 g– 1 for the ethanol CVD-treated EV...|$|E
40|$|Replacing the {{exchangeable}} interlayer ions in Palabora vermiculite with magnesium, aluminumor iron (III) ions {{does not}} affect the exfoliation onset temperature (456 ± 11 °C). However, co-intercalation of minor amounts of urea lowers the exfoliation onset temperature to 209 ± 35 °C. This significant decrease is attributed to the low thermal stability of urea which releases ammonia and water as blowing agents. Thermo-mechanical analysis indicates that the <b>expanded</b> <b>vermiculite</b> exhibits spring-like properties. Part of the original expansion is recovered when the applied force is removed. The observed hysteresis is attributed to the progressive flattening ofwarped/buckled sheets that make up the expandedworm-like structure. Provided the expanded flake has not been heated beyond 450 °C, it can be reconstituted by applying a sufficiently high compressive force followed by equilibration with distilled water. Such flakes show the conventional exfoliation behavior when heated again.
