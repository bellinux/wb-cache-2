40|$|The {{combination}} of photoelectron spectroscopy and ultrafast light sources {{is on track}} to set new standards for detailed interrogation of dynamics and reactivity of molecules. A crucial prerequisite for further progress is the ability to not only detect the electron kinetic energy, as done in traditional photoelectron spectroscopy, but also the photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) in the molecular frame. Here carbonylsulfide (OCS) and benzonitrile molecules, fixed in space by combined laser and electrostatic fields, are ionized with intense, circularly polarized, 30 femtosecond laser pulses. For 1 -dimensionally oriented OCS the molecular <b>frame</b> <b>PADs</b> exhibit pronounced anisotropies, perpendicular to the fixed permanent dipole moment, that are absent in PADs from randomly oriented molecules. For 3 -dimensionally oriented benzonitrile additional striking structures appear due to suppression of electron emission in nodal planes of the fixed electronic orbitals. Our theoretical analysis, relying on tunneling ionization theory, shows that the PADs reflect nodal planes, permanent dipole moments and polarizabilities of both the neutral molecule and its cation. The calculated results are exponentially sensitive to changes in these molecular properties thereby pointing to exciting opportunities for time-resolved probing of valence electrons dynamics by intense circularly polarized pulses. Molecular <b>frame</b> <b>PADs</b> from oriented molecules will prove important in other contexts notably in emerging free-electron-laser studies where localized inner shell electrons are knocked off by x-ray pulses...|$|R

50|$|Though {{it would}} seem that {{standardised}} name mangling in the C++ language would lead to greater interoperability between compiler implementations, such a standardization by itself would not suffice to guarantee C++ compiler interoperability and it might even create a false impression that interoperability is possible and safe when it isn't. Name mangling is only one of several application binary interface (ABI) details that need to be decided and observed by a C++ implementation. Other ABI aspects like exception handling, virtual table layout, structure and stack <b>frame</b> <b>padding,</b> etc. also cause differing C++ implementations to be incompatible. Further, requiring a particular form of mangling would cause issues for systems where implementation limits (e.g., length of symbols) dictate a particular mangling scheme. A standardised requirement for name mangling would also prevent an implementation where mangling was not required at all — for example, a linker which understood the C++ language.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The work {{relates the}} area of Stegenography, network {{protocols}} and security for data hiding in communication networks. Hiding information in network traffic may lead to leakage of confidential information. Steganography {{is defined as the}} art and science of hiding information, which is a process that involves hiding a message in an appropriate carrier for example an image file. The carrier can then be sent to a receiver without anyone else knowing that it contains a hidden message. Implementation of new Stegenography, the PadSteg (Padding Stegenography) system is implemented. It is the first information hiding solution which represents inter-protocol steganography i. e. usage of relation between two or more protocols from the TCP/IP stack to enable secret communication. PadSteg utilizes ARP and TCP protocols together with an Ether leak vulnerability (improper Ethernet <b>frame</b> <b>padding)</b> to facilitate secret communication for hidden groups in LANs (Local Area Networks). Proposed work is to confirm that PadSteg is feasible in today’s network and it provides more security within secret group...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} several basic {{problems in}} VLSI routing such as river routing between rectangles, routing within a rectilinear polygon, wiring module pins to <b>frame</b> <b>pads</b> and channel routing in the knock-knee model. The known strategies to handle these problems {{seem to be}} inherently sequential. We develop new techniques that lead to efficient parallel algorithms. Our basic model of parallel processing is the CREWPRAM. All our algorithms use p processors, where 1 < p < n, n is the input length, and run in time O(n/p +log n) or O((n log n) /p +log^ 2 n). Our algorithms have fast implementations on other parallel models such as the mesh and the hypercube. For the river routing problem between rectangles, we have derived O(n/p + log n) algorithms to determine the characteristic bendpoints and the minimum separation, and O((n log n) /p + log^ 2 n) algorithm to solve the offset problem. To solve the routing problem within a rectilinear polygon, we convert the layout problem into a geometric problem of finding the union of rectilinear polygons and develop O(n/p + log n) algorithms for both the detailed routing and routability testing problems For the problem of wiring module pins to <b>frame</b> <b>pads,</b> we develop a new strategy that leads to an O(np + log n) algorithm. We have also developed 0 ((n log n) /p + log^ 2 n) algorithms to detect routability and to minimize the total wire length. To solve the channel routing problem in the knock-knee model, we have developed an O (n/p + log n) parallel algorithm to partition the n input nets into d chains, where d is {{the density of the}} problem. This new technique could replace the left edge or the greedy strategy for channel routing. Then we have developed O(n/p + log n) algorithms to modify the above chains and to generate the optimal wiring.

40|$|Abstract—Load-balanced {{switches}} {{have received}} much attention {{because they are}} more scalable than other switch architectures. However, a load-balanced switch has the problem of packet missequencing. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Mailbox Sharing (DMS) scheme to eliminate the mis-sequencing problem of load-balanced switches only at the cost of a very small increase of delay. The key idea is to keep packets of the same flow in order in the load-balanced switch. The DMS scheme is based on two statistical facts in operational networks: the number of simultaneous active flows in the router buffer is far less than that of in-progress flows, and most of the intra-flow packet intervals are longer than the packet delay in the high speed router. In DMS, the packet sequence of the same flow arrived in the input ports is recorded in the mailbox maintained in the output ports. Then, packets of the same flow are delivered according to the order of their arrivals. The mailbox becomes the bottleneck in order to accommodate a large number of flows. We thus propose a dynamic sharing scheme to alleviate the bottleneck and greatly enhance the scalability of the mailbox. By simulations using the real internet traffic traces, we show that with a simple flow splitter mechanism restraining mis-sequencing, the average packet delay using DMS is considerably lower than that of other schemes including Uniform <b>Frame</b> Spreading, <b>Padded</b> <b>Frame</b> and the CR switch, and it is close to the ideal case without resequencing even when the load is very high. The results also demonstrate that the size of mailbox is in the hundreds. Keywords- load-balanced switch; mailbox; dynamic sharing I...|$|R

The need for this new design was consumer-driven. Patients and caregivers identified the following fatal flaws in the com-mode-shower chairs used in Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) centers: 1) risk for patient falls during transfers, propelling, and while leaning over for showering; 2) risk for pressure ulcers due to inadequate padding and seat positioning for lengthy bowel care regimes; 3) inadequate caregiver access to the perianal area of the patient to perform bowel care procedures; and, 4) wheel-related inability to properly position the chair directly over the toilet.

40|$|Modern office {{buildings}} are often open plan buildings with a frame consisting of flat RC slabs, RC columns and non-load bearing {{internal and external}} partitions and facades. These modern framed structures are more flexible than older conventional buildings with load bearing walls and are less susceptible to differential settlement damage. The use of conventional guidelines for differential settlement on modern flexible framed structures may therefore be over-conservative. The literature review of the study highlights the factors producing differential settlement, the types of damage caused by differential settlement and conventional guidelines for limiting differential settlement damage. Conventional guidelines focusing on 2 D structures lack provision for the 3 D deformation of a structure.
