500|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} common thermal projectiles were {{boiling water and}} <b>hot</b> <b>sand,</b> which could be poured over attacking personnel. [...] Other anti-personnel weapons included the use of hot pitch, oil, resin, animal fat and other similar compounds. [...] Smoke was used to confuse or drive off attackers. [...] Substances such as quicklime and sulfur could be toxic and blinding.|$|E
500|$|Such heated {{missiles}} {{have also}} been used in mining situations; the 1st century Roman writer Vitruvius describes a counter-mine dug above the attackers' gallery by defenders at the siege of Apollonia. [...] Piercing the floor between the mines, the Apollonian defenders poured down boiling water, <b>hot</b> <b>sand</b> and hot pitch onto the heads of their enemy. Other mixtures were more innovative; the defenders at Chester in 918 boiled a mixture of water and ale in copper tubs and poured it over the Viking besiegers, causing their skin to peel off.|$|E
2500|$|On Volcano island, the {{destruction}} was complete. It seems {{that when the}} black, fan-shaped cloud spread, it created a blast downward that forced hot steam and gases down {{the slopes of the}} crater, accompanied by a shower of hot mud and sand. Many trees had the bark shredded and cut away from the surface by the <b>hot</b> <b>sand</b> and mud blast that accompanied the explosion and contributed so much to the loss of life and destruction of property. The fact that practically all the vegetation was bent downward, away from the crater, proved that {{there must have been a}} very strong blast down the outside slopes of the cone. Very little vegetation was actually burned or even scorched. Six hours after the explosion, dust from the crater was noticeable in Manila as it settled on furniture and other polished surfaces. The solid matter ejected had a volume of between [...] (VEI = 3.7). Ashes fell over an area of , although the area in which actual destruction took place measured only [...] [...] The detonation from the explosion was heard over an area more than [...] in diameter.|$|E

50|$|Serial {{production}} {{started in}} 1986 {{with the number}} of vehicles produced approximately 2000 pieces per year. Vehicles were able to work under different conditions across mainland China from warm areas in the south, across the <b>hot</b> <b>sands</b> of the Gobi Desert to the icy heights of Tibet.|$|R

50|$|This {{species is}} largely nocturnal. By day this snake {{may be found}} {{sheltering}} in hollow logs or under leaf debris. When travelling across <b>hot</b> <b>sands</b> or other surfaces it lifts its body {{off the ground and}} reaches far forward before pushing off the ground again, having only a few inches of its body touching the ground at a time.|$|R

6000|$|Materials for Candles.--Tallow.--Mutton-suet {{mixed with}} ox-tallow {{is the best}} {{material}} for candles. Tallow should never be melted over a hot fire: {{it is best to}} melt it by putting the pot in <b>hot</b> <b>sand.</b> To procure fat, see [...] "Greasing Leather," [...] p. 343.|$|E
60|$|Felipe {{took the}} {{commission}} that the collector handed to him. He gazed {{through the open}} window at the sea for a moment, with his customary expression of deep but vain pondering. Then he turned without having spoken a word, and walked swiftly away through the <b>hot</b> <b>sand</b> of the street.|$|E
60|$|And so {{they moved}} {{to the side of}} the gorge beneath the shade of an {{overhanging}} rock and lay down in the <b>hot</b> <b>sand</b> to rest. Numa wandered restlessly to and fro and finally, after sprawling for a moment close beside the ape-man, rose and moved off up the gorge to be lost to view a moment later beyond the nearest turn.|$|E
50|$|Searchers {{found the}} {{wreckage}} strewn over 500 yd after trekking 15 mi over <b>hot</b> <b>sands</b> to reach it, where the aircraft wreckage was found almost completely burnt out. The {{bodies of the}} victims were badly charred, delaying identification. A United Press International correspondent reported that the plane had smashed into a narrow-gauge railway in hitting the ground and had plowed up a considerable stretch of track.|$|R

60|$|Sulphur.--The lumps must be melted over {{a gentle}} fire; the pot should then {{be put in}} a heap of <b>hot</b> <b>sand,</b> to give the {{impurities}} time to settle, before it cools into a mass. When this has taken place, the bottom part must be broken off and put aside as unfit for making gunpowder, and the top part alone used. Flower of sulphur is quite pure.|$|E
6000|$|About noon the {{following}} day, the horses whinnied, and the mules roused {{out of their}} tardy gait. [...] "They smell water," [...] said Emmett. And despite the heat, and the sand in my nostrils, I smelled it, too. The dogs, poor foot-sore fellows, trotted on ahead down the trail. A few more miles of <b>hot</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel and red stone brought us around a low mesa to the Little Colorado.|$|E
60|$|The peons {{took up the}} stretcher-poles lashed to the coffin, {{a relief}} party went behind and they set off. Nobody spoke and the Meztisos' bare feet fell silently on the <b>hot</b> <b>sand,</b> {{although}} Kit heard the dragging tramp of the sailors' muddy boots. In the open space round the village, the sun burned their skin and they pushed on {{as fast as possible}} for the twilight of the woods.|$|E

60|$|The youth traced his {{descent from}} the sea-kings of Norway--those {{tremendous}} fellows who were wont in days of yore to ravage {{the shores of}} the known and unknown world, east and west, north and south, leaving their indelible mark alike on the <b>hot</b> <b>sands</b> of Africa and the icebound rocks of Greenland. As Phil Maylands knew nothing of his own lineage further back than his grandfather, he was free to admire the immense antiquity of his friend's genealogical tree. Phil was not, however, so completely under the fascination of his hero as to be utterly blind to his faults; but he loved him, and that sufficed to cover them up.|$|R

60|$|Springes.--General Remarks.--Harden {{the wood}} of which the {{mechanism}} has to be made, by means of fire; either baking it in <b>hot</b> <b>sand</b> or ashes, or otherwise applying heat to a degree just short of charring its surface. The mechanism will then retain the sharpness of its edges under a continuance of pressure, and during many hours of wet weather. The slighter the strain on the springe, the more delicately can its mechanism be set.|$|E
60|$|Towards noon {{certain of}} them came and squatted basking in the <b>hot</b> <b>sand.</b> The {{imperious}} voices of hunger and thirst prevailed over my dread. I {{came out of the}} bushes, and, revolver in hand, walked down towards these seated figures. One, a Wolf-woman, turned her head and stared at me, and then the others. None attempted to rise or salute me. I felt too faint and weary to insist, and I let the moment pass.|$|E
6000|$|When {{they were}} well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry, <b>hot</b> <b>sand,</b> and lie there and cover {{themselves}} up with it, and by and by break for the water again {{and go through the}} original performance once more. Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented flesh-colored [...] "tights" [...] very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and had a circus--with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest post to his neighbor.|$|E
50|$|Tristão Raposo, a nineteen-year-old {{black child}} of the Rio de Janeiro slums, spies Isabel Leme, an eighteen-year-old upper-class white girl, across the <b>hot</b> <b>sands</b> of Copacabana Beach, and {{presents}} her with a ring stolen from an American tourist. Their flight into marriage takes them from urban banality to the farthest reaches of Brazil’s wild west, where magic still rules. Privation, violence, captivity and poverty afflict them; his mother curses them, her father strives to separate them, and neither lover is absolutely faithful. Eventually, ancient charms change him to white and her to black. Yet Tristão and Isabel {{hold on to the}} belief that each is the other’s fate for life, as they develop in ways they never thought possible.|$|R
60|$|The {{carriers}} {{had stopped}} in a deserted village one morning {{after a long}} and arduous march from the mission station, when Ormsgill, lying in the <b>hot</b> white <b>sand,</b> looked quietly at Nares, who sat with his back {{against one of the}} empty huts.|$|R
5000|$|After {{an implied}} global nuclear {{catastrophe}} Japan {{has been reduced}} to a desert and the surviving humans seek out a meager living in the <b>hot</b> <b>sands.</b> Desert Punk focuses on the adventures of a wandering mercenary named Kanta Mizuno, nicknamed Desert Punk (Sunabōzu), due to his seemingly incredible feats of skill and daring while on the job. Throughout the series, he acquires an apprentice and makes a few friends as well as enemies. [...] "The Great Kanto Desert is a truly miserable place. It’s also the home of hero-for-hire Desert Punk, {{the closest thing to a}} good guy the sandy wasteland’s got. He’s never failed to complete a mission, and he’s known far and wide as the best man for any job.|$|R
60|$|Snatching my cap {{from beneath}} the desk where I had {{concealed}} it at recess, I hurried out and away over the sand-lot on the shortest way home. No stopping now for burrs!--I ran like one pursued. I shall never forget as long as I live, the pain, the panic, the frenzy of that race against time. The <b>hot</b> <b>sand</b> burned my feet, my side ached, my mouth was dry, and yet I ran {{on and on and}} on, looking back from moment to moment, seeing pursuers in every moving object.|$|E
60|$|Other Materials for Writing.--Quills {{and other}} Pens.--Any feather that is large enough, {{can be at}} once made into a good writing-quill. It has only to be dipped in <b>hot</b> <b>sand,</b> which causes the {{membrane}} inside the quill to shrivel up, and the outside membrane to split and peel off: a few instants are sufficient to do this. The proper temperature of the sand is about 340 degrees. The operation may be repeated with advantage two or three times. Reeds are in universal use throughout the East for writing with ink. Flat fish-bones make decent pens.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps, however, this {{suffering}} did us a service, since otherwise exhaustion, thirst, {{and dust}} might have overwhelmed our senses, and caused us {{to fall into}} a sleep from which we never should have awakened. Yet {{at the time we}} were not grateful to it, for at last the agony became almost unbearable. Indeed, Orme told me afterwards that the last thing he could remember was a quaint fancy that he had made a colossal fortune by selling the secret of a new torture to the Chinese--that of <b>hot</b> <b>sand</b> driven on to the victim by a continuous blast of hot air.|$|E
50|$|Burnap played {{washboard}} in a skiffle {{band with}} classmates {{as a teenager}} in England. He moved to New Zealand at age 19, where he began playing trombone and played in the Omega Jazz Band in 1960-62. From 1962 to 1965 he played in Australia with the <b>Hot</b> <b>Sands</b> Jazz Band (1962-64) and Geoff Bull's Olympia Jazz Band (1964-65). In 1965 he played for a time at Preservation Hall in New Orleans, then returned briefly to the UK, playing with Terry Lightfoot and Monty Sunshine. He spent three further years (1966-69) in Australia before moving permanently back to the UK, settling in London. He played with Ian Armit (1969-70), Alan Elsdon (1970-75), Alex Welsh (1978-79), and Acker Bilk (1980-87). After 1988 Burnap hosted jazz radio programs for the BBC and Jazz FM.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} ancient Egyptian mummies {{were created}} naturally {{due to the}} environment in which they were buried. In the era prior to 3500 BCE, Egyptians buried the dead in pit graves, without regard to social status. Pit graves were often shallow. This characteristic allowed for the <b>hot,</b> dry <b>sand</b> of the desert to dehydrate the bodies, leading to natural mummification.|$|R
40|$|Verse 1] The hot {{winds that}} come to thee O’er desert sands all go from me, I bid them to tell thee that I love thee, Speeding my soul to thee. <b>Hot</b> <b>sands</b> burning, Fire my veins with passion bold, Love I’ll love thee, till desert sands grow cold! [Refrain] Love me, I’ll love thee Till the sands of the desert grow cold, And their {{infinite}} numbers are told, God gave thee, to me, And mine thou shalt be, Forever to have and hold Till the story of Judgment is told, And the myst’ries of Heaven unfold, I’ll turn, love, to thee, My shrine thou shalt be Till the sands of the desert grow cold. [Verse 2] The desert, a burning sea, A barrier stands ‘tween thee and me, Or love, fast as light, I’d hasten to thee, Quenching my thirst in thee. Noon suns find me, Far behind the caravan, Death there warns me, how vain is the strength of man...|$|R
