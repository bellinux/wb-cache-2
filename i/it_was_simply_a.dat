The amounts show {{the majority of the}} work took place from 1514 to 1519; later there are only a couple of bigger expenditures on the beacon. A fire was first lit in the autumn of 1531; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> bonfire on top of the tower.|$|E
5|$|The six {{enter the}} Department of Mysteries where they reveal a bottled prophecy, the object Voldemort was after. However, they are ambushed by Death Eaters, {{including}} Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange. Lucius reveals that Harry only saw {{a dream of}} Sirius being tortured; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> ruse to lure Harry into the Death Eaters' grasp. Harry refuses to give Lucius the prophecy, and a battle between Dumbledore's Army and the Death Eaters ensues. The Death Eaters take everyone except Harry as hostages, threatening to kill them unless he surrenders the prophecy.|$|E
5|$|Northumbria's {{southern}} frontier with Mercia {{ran across}} England, from the Humber in the east, following the River Ouse and the River Don, to the Mersey in the west. Some archaeological evidence, the Roman Rig dyke, near modern Sheffield, appears {{to show that}} it was a defended border, with large earthworks set back from the frontier. The Nico Ditch, to the south of modern Manchester, has been cited in this context, though it has also been argued that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> boundary marker without fortifications. In the far north, the evidence is less clear, and it appears that authority lay with sub-kings, perhaps including native British rulers. The family of Ecgfrith's general Berht may have been one such dynasty of under-kings.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} the mid-1350s that {{military}} operations on the Continent were resumed on a large scale. In 1356, Edward's eldest son, Edward, the Black Prince, won an important victory in the Battle of Poitiers. The greatly outnumbered English forces not only routed the French, but captured the French king, John II and his youngest son, Philip. After a succession of victories, the English held great possessions in France, the French king was in English custody, and the French central government had almost totally collapsed. There has been a historical debate as to whether Edward's claim to the French crown originally was genuine, or if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> political ploy meant to put pressure on the French government. Regardless of the original intent, the stated claim now seemed to be within reach. Yet a campaign in 1359, meant to complete the undertaking, was inconclusive. In 1360, therefore, Edward accepted the Treaty of Brétigny, whereby he renounced his claims to the French throne, but secured his extended French possessions in full sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|The 1820s {{belonged to}} caudillos, since {{the country was}} in full process of formation.

Cepeda's Battle faced the commanders of the Littoral with the central power.|$|E

25|$|The {{specific}} reason Lee {{chose this}} risky strategy of splitting his army to capture Harpers Ferry is not known. One {{possibility is that}} he knew it commanded his supply lines through the Shenandoah Valley. Before he entered Maryland he had assumed that the Federal garrisons at Winchester, Martinsburg, and Harpers Ferry would be cut off and abandoned without firing a shot (and, in fact, both Winchester and Martinsburg were evacuated). Another possibility is that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> tempting target with many vital supplies but virtually indefensible. McClellan requested permission from Washington to evacuate Harpers Ferry and attach its garrison to his army, but his request was refused.|$|E
25|$|Price {{continued}} his cartage towards Fort Scott, Kansas. In {{the late afternoon}} of October 25, Price's supply train had difficulty crossing the Marmiton River ford and just as at Mine Creek earlier that afternoon, Price had to make another stand. Brig. Gen. John McNeil, commanding two brigades of Pleasonton's cavalry, engaged troops that Price and his officers had rallied from the earlier battles, including a sizable contingent of unarmed men. Observing the large Confederate force and not knowing that many were unarmed, McNeil refrained from an all-out assault. After about two hours of skirmishing Price recommenced his retreat, while McNeil could not mount an effective pursuit. Price's army was utterly broken by this time; now <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> question of whether he could escape, and how many men he could successfully evacuate to friendly territory.|$|E
500|$|The Little Rock Arsenal was {{classified}} in 1860 as an [...] "arsenal of deposit," [...] meaning that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> warehouse for {{the storage of}} weapons intended {{for the use of}} the state militia in times of crisis. Thus there were no substantial operations for ordnance fabrication or repairs, nor for the manufacture of cartridges at the time the Arsenal fell into State hands. Most of these operations were started from scratch through the efforts of the Arkansas Military Board.|$|E

500|$|Jethro Tull's {{frontman}} {{and songwriter}} Ian Anderson {{was surprised when}} critics called the band's previous album, Aqualung (1971), a [...] "concept album". He rejected this, thinking <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> collection of songs, so in response decided to [...] "come {{up with something that}} really is the mother of all concept albums". Taking the surreal English humour of Monty Python as an influence, he began to write a piece that would combine complex music with a sense of humour, with the idea it would poke light-hearted fun at the band, the audience, and the music critics. He also intended to satirise the progressive rock genre that was popular at the time.|$|E
500|$|Shankly {{wrote in}} his {{autobiography}} that he had long prepared himself for {{a career as a}} football manager. He pointed out that he had absorbed all the coaching systems with any useful qualifications and had full confidence in his ability and in himself to be a leader. For him, he had done the hard work and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> question of waiting for an opportunity to present itself. Shankly summed up the essential criteria for success in football management when he said: [...] "I could speak common sense about the game and I could spot a player". In spotting a player, he always applied a basic formula which was that, first and foremost, the player must have both ability and courage. Other attributes were physical fitness and willingness to work, especially to struggle against the odds.|$|E
500|$|While the {{majority}} of the staff were pleased with [...] "Tapestry", Piller felt that the premise was tired and was concerned that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> take on the film It's a Wonderful Life. He said that some scenes were [...] "very talky", and the direction and some performances were [...] "flat". Moore participated in an AOL chat in 1997, where he described [...] "Tapestry" [...] as [...] "one of the best things I wrote and one of TNGs finest episodes". Some fans wrote in to the staff to complain that the episode glorified violence, and was against the principles of Star Trek. Jeri Taylor admitted that the episode could be seen as violent, but it never crossed the mind of any of the staff during production. She {{went on to say that}} if they had realized that [...] "Tapestry" [...] could be considered to promote violence, then they would have corrected it to ensure that it wouldn't be viewed as such.|$|E

500|$|In {{the decade}} {{following}} {{ratification of the}} Fifteenth Amendment, both Stanton and Anthony increasingly took the position, first advocated by Victoria Woodhull, that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments actually did give women the right to vote. They argued that the Fourteenth Amendment, which defined citizens as [...] "all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof," [...] included women and that the Fifteenth Amendment provided all citizens {{with the right to}} vote. Using this logic, they asserted that women now had the constitutional right to vote and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> matter of claiming that right. This constitution-based argument, which came to be called [...] "the new departure" [...] in women's rights circles because of its divergence from earlier attempts to change voting laws on a state-by-state basis, led to first Anthony (in 1872), and later Stanton (in 1880), going to the polls and demanding to vote. Despite this, and similar attempts made by hundreds of other women, it would be nearly 50 years before women obtained the right to vote throughout the United States.|$|E
500|$|Star player Cyclone Taylor had {{defected}} to Renfrew, and despite a salary war with Renfrew, Ottawa managed to re-sign their other top players, Dubby Kerr, Fred Lake and Marty Walsh for the 1909–10 season. On Taylor's first return in February 1910, {{he made a}} promise to score a goal while making a rush backwards against Ottawa. This led to incredible interest, with over 7,000 in attendance. A bet of $100 was placed at the King Edward Hotel against him scoring at all. Ottawa won 8–5 (scoring 3 goals in overtime) and kept Taylor off the scoresheet. Later in the season at the return match in Renfrew, Taylor made good on his boast with a goal scored backwards, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> goal scored on a backhand shot. This was the final game of the season, and Ottawa had no chance at the league title and did not appear to have put in an effort in a 17–2 loss, considered [...] "the worst trimming ever handed to a team wearing the Ottawa colors".|$|E
500|$|Hints {{and rumors}} began {{circulating}} about {{a sequel to}} Final Fantasy XIII-2 as early as December 2011, when Square Enix registered the Final Fantasy XIII-3 web domain. At the time, the company stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> precaution and did not mean {{there was such a}} game. After the game was released with a [...] "To be continued" [...] ending, Square Enix said that the ending was chosen to prompt players to explore the alternative endings and remain ready for the coming DLC levels. However, after the release of what was stated to be the final piece of DLC, officials at Square Enix announced that they would be releasing future Final Fantasy XIII-related content. In late August 2012, a teaser site was unveiled in preparation for the Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Event, titled [...] "A Storm Gathers", promising a [...] "new direction for the saga of key character Lightning". At the event, it was announced that the title for this game would be , that it would be released in 2013, and that it would serve as the ending to the story of the main Final Fantasy XIII character, Lightning.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Ron (Nick Offerman) saying to Leslie (Amy Poehler), [...] "Here's the situation...", {{prompting}} {{her to go}} into a full rendition of the rap [...] "Parents Just Don't Understand". Afterward, he tells her someone is on fire at a park and needs immediate assistance. Later, Leslie holds a marriage for two recently acquired penguins to help promote the Pawnee Zoo. Immediately after the marriage, the two penguins begin having sex in front of a crowd of children, who are informed by an adult in the audience that both penguins are actually males. The Bulge, a gay bar in Pawnee, later sends Leslie a wedding cake with two penguins on top to thank her for supporting the gay community. April (Aubrey Plaza) introduces Leslie to her boyfriend Derek (Blake Lee), who himself also has a boyfriend named Ben (Josh Duvendeck), much to Leslie's confusion. They declare her their [...] "hero" [...] for holding the gay penguin wedding, but Leslie insists <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> publicity stunt, not a political statement. Nevertheless, Marcia Langman (Darlene Hunt), a member of the Society for Family Stability Foundation, demands she annul the penguin wedding or resign from the parks department.|$|E
500|$|Caligari was {{released}} {{at a time}} when foreign film industries had just started easing restrictions on the import of German films following World War I. The film was acquired for American distribution by the Goldwyn Distributing Company, and had its American premiere at the Capitol Theatre on 3 April 1921. It was given a live theatrical prologue and epilogue, which was not unusual for film premieres at major theatres at the time. In the prologue, the film is introduced by a character called [...] "Cranford", who identifies himself as the man Francis speaks with in the opening scene. In the epilogue, Cranford returns and exclaims that Francis has fully recovered from his madness. Mike Budd believes these additions simplified the film and [...] "adjusted [...] for mass consumption", though Robinson argued <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> normal theatrical novelty for the time. Capitol Theatre runner Samuel Roxy Rothafel commissioned conductor Ernö Rapée to compile a musical accompaniment that included portions of songs by composers Johann Strauss III, Arnold Schoenberg, Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev. Rotafel wanted the score to match the dark mood of the film, saying: [...] "The music had, as it were, to be made eligible for citizenship in a nightmare country".|$|E
500|$|Cartman's anti-Semitism, while mostly {{limited to}} mocking Kyle, culminates {{in the season}} eight (2004) episode [...] "The Passion of the Jew". In the episode, Cartman, after {{watching}} The Passion of the Christ numerous times, deifies the film's director, Mel Gibson, and starts an official Gibson fan club, praising Gibson for [...] "trying to express—through cinema—the horror and filthiness of the common Jew". Cartman's interpretation of the film influences him to dress up as Adolf Hitler and lead other fan club members (who are oblivious of Cartman's actual intentions) in a failed effort {{to engage in a}} systematic genocide of the Jews {{similar to that of the}} Final Solution. In the season 10 (2006) episode [...] "Smug Alert!", Cartman anonymously saves Kyle's life in an effort to get him and his family to return to South Park from San Francisco, revealing that he craves the animosity shared between the two. And in [...] "Coon vs. Coon and Friends" [...] (season 14, 2010), Cartman directs the [...] "evil god" [...] Cthulhu to destroy [...] "most of the synagogues". However, in the 16th-season episode [...] "Jewpacabra" [...] Cartman revealed he had converted to Judaism after a hallucinogenic dream. As of season 19, it is unsure whether he has retained this trait or whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> plot point in that one episode.|$|E
