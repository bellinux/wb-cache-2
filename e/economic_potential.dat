5|$|In 1894, the {{peninsula}} was visited by the Russian Minister of Finance, who became {{convinced of the}} region's <b>economic</b> <b>potential.</b> Consequently, in 1896 a telephone and a telegraph line were extended to Kola, improving the communication with the mainland. A possibility of building a railway was also considered, but no action was taken at the time. Also in 1896, Alexandrovsk (now Polyarny) was founded, and grew in size so rapidly that it was granted town status in 1899; Kolsky Uyezd was renamed Alexandrovsky on that occasion.|$|E

5|$|According to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers report, India's GDP at {{purchasing}} power parity could overtake {{that of the}} United States by 2045.

The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle class. The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its <b>economic</b> <b>potential,</b> it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} few years Philip II was {{occupied}} with reorganizing the administrative system of Thessaly, campaigning against the Illyrian ruler Pleuratus I, deposing Arybbas in Epirus in favor of his brother-in-law Alexander I (through Philip II's marriage with Olympias), and defeating Cersebleptes in Thrace. This allowed him to extend Macedonian control over the Hellespont in anticipation of an invasion into Achaemenid Asia. In what is now Bulgaria, Philip II conquered the Thracian city of Panegyreis in 342 BC and reestablished it as Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv, Roman-era Trimontium). War broke out with Athens in 340 BC while Philip II was engaged in two ultimately unsuccessful sieges of Perinthus and Byzantion, followed by a successful campaign against the Scythians along the Danube and Macedonia's involvement in the Fourth Sacred War against Amphissa in 339 BC. Hostilities between Thebes and Macedonia began when Thebes ousted a Macedonian garrison from Nicaea (near Thermopylae), leading Thebes to join Athens, Megara, Corinth, Achaea, and Euboea in a final confrontation against Macedonia at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. After the Macedonian victory there, Philip II imposed harsh conditions on Thebes, installing an oligarchy there, yet was lenient to Athens due to his desire to utilize their navy in a planned invasion of the Achaemenid Empire. He was then chiefly responsible for the formation of the League of Corinth that included the major Greek city-states minus Sparta, being elected as the leader (hegemon) of its council (synedrion) by the spring of 337 BC despite the Kingdom of Macedonia being excluded as an official member of the league. The Panhellenic fear of another Persian invasion of Greece perhaps contributed to Philip II's decision to invade the Achaemenid Empire. The Persian aid offered to Perinthus and Byzantion in 341-340 BC highlighted Macedonia's strategic need to secure Thrace and the Aegean Sea against increasing Achaemenid encroachment, as Artaxerxes III further consolidated his control over satrapies in western Anatolia. The latter region, yielding far more wealth and valuable resources than the Balkans, was also coveted by the Macedonian king for its sheer <b>economic</b> <b>potential.</b>|$|E

40|$|Metabolic fluxes {{are governed}} by {{physical}} and economic principles. Stationarity constrains them to a subspace in flux space and thermodynamics makes them lead from higher to lower chemical potentials. At the same time, fluxes in cells represent a compromise between metabolic performance and enzyme cost. To capture this, some flux prediction methods penalise larger fluxes by heuristic cost terms. Economic flux analysis, in contrast, postulates a balance between enzyme costs and metabolic benefits as {{a necessary condition for}} fluxes to be realised by kinetic models with optimal enzyme levels. The constraints are formulated using <b>economic</b> <b>potentials,</b> state variables that capture the enzyme labour embodied in metabolites. Generally, fluxes must lead from lower to higher <b>economic</b> <b>potentials.</b> This principle, which resembles thermodynamic constraints, can complement stationarity and thermodynamic constraints in flux analysis. Futile modes, which would be incompatible with <b>economic</b> <b>potentials,</b> are defined algebraically and can be systematically removed from flux distributions. Enzymes that participate in potential futile modes are likely targets of regulation. Economic flux analysis can predict high-yield and low-yield strategies, and captures preemptive expression, multi-objective optimisation, and flux distributions across several cells living in symbiosis. Inspired by labour value theories in economics, it justifies and extends the principle of minimal fluxes and provides an intuitive framework to model the complex interplay of fluxes, metabolic control, and enzyme costs in cells...|$|R
