50|$|Funded {{in part by}} the French {{petrochemical}} industry, the Conshelf Two {{experiment was}} originally intended to demonstrate the practicality of exploitation of the sea using underwater habitats as base stations. In the end Cousteau repudiated such an approach, turning his efforts instead toward conservation. The lyrical and dramatic underwater sequences also likely contributed to the beginning of an era of ocean conservation as well as incidentally promoting sport diving. Memorable sequences involve men cavorting with fishes, an underwater chess game, and the <b>diving</b> <b>saucer</b> reaching depths of 300 meters, encountering new and unique forms of life.|$|E
50|$|Divers and {{scientists}} {{of the expedition}} observe the fauna and the ice formations of the frozen continent. Footage is filmed on board the Calypso but also on land (for example at Deception Island), underwater, over sea ice or from the air, {{by means of a}} hot air balloon and a helicopter. Voyage to the Edge of the World was the first film to show underwater footage taken from the submerged inside of glaciers or icebergs. It also was the first film to show high depth footage in Antarctic waters (thanks to the <b>diving</b> <b>saucer</b> SP-350 Denise).|$|E
50|$|In 1974, the Alvin (operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Deep Sea Place Research Center), the French bathyscaphe Archim√®de, and the French <b>diving</b> <b>saucer</b> Cyane, {{assisted}} by support ships and the Glomar Challenger, explored the great rift {{valley of the}} Mid-Atlantic Ridge, southwest of the Azores. About 5,200 photographs of the region were taken, and samples of relatively young solidified magma were found {{on each side of}} the central fissure of the rift valley, giving additional proof that the seafloor spreads at this site at a rate of about 2.5 cm (about 1 in) per year (see plate tectonics,).|$|E
5000|$|Calypso carried {{advanced}} equipment, including one- and two-man mini submarines {{developed by}} Cousteau, <b>diving</b> <b>saucers,</b> and underwater scooters. The ship was also {{fitted with a}} see-through [...] "nose" [...] and an observation chamber 3 m below the waterline, and was modified to house scientific equipment and a helicopter pad. The Calypso underwater camera is named after this ship.|$|R
40|$|Designed by the Westinghouse Corporation in {{collaboration}} with Jacques Cousteau, DEEPSTAR- 4000 is a deep diving research vehicle based on Captain Cousteau's <b>DIVING</b> <b>SAUCER.</b> An evaluation of DEEPSTAR's operational performance at sea is presented in this report through a description of typical dive procedures and the actual NAVOCEANO dive results...|$|E
40|$|A new Caulophacus species, Caulophacus cyanae, {{from the}} area of {{hydrothermal}} vents of the East Pacific Ridge at 13 degree N, is described. It was collected by the a <b>diving</b> <b>saucer</b> {{at a depth of}} 2, 660 m, and fixed just after arrival on board. This species is typical of the extinct chimneys, and has never been found outside the graben...|$|E
