2500|$|Malt {{is often}} {{divided into two}} {{categories}} by brewers: base malts and specialty malts; base malts have enough diastatic power to convert their own starch and usually that of some amount of starch from unmalted grain, called adjuncts, while specialty malts have little diastatic power, but provide flavor, color, or [...] "body" [...] (viscosity) to the finished beer. Specialty caramel or crystal malts {{have been subjected to}} heat treatment to convert their starches to sugars nonenzymatically. Within these categories is a variety of types distinguished largely by the <b>kilning</b> <b>temperature</b> (see mash ingredients).|$|E
50|$|Similarly to crystal malts in Britain, central Europe {{makes use}} of caramel malts, which are {{moistened}} and kilned at temperatures around 55-65 °C in a rotating drum before being heated to higher temperatures for browning. The lower-temperature moistened kilning causes conversion and mashing {{to take place in}} the oven, resulting in a grain's starches becoming mostly or entirely converted to sugar before darkening. Caramel malts are produced in color grades analogous to other lager malts: carapils for pilsener malt, caravienne or carahell for Vienna malt, and caramunch for Munich malt. Color and final <b>kilning</b> <b>temperature</b> are comparable to non-caramel analog malts; there is no diastatic activity. Carapils malt is sometimes also called dextrin malt. 10-120 °L.|$|E
5000|$|Black malt, {{also called}} patent malt or black patent malt, is barley malt {{that has been}} kilned {{to the point of}} carbonizing, around 200 °C. The term [...] "patent malt" [...] comes from its {{invention}} in England in 1817, late enough that the inventor of the process for its manufacture, Daniel Wheeler, was awarded a patent. Black malt provides the color and some of the flavor in black porter, contributing an acrid, ashy undertone to the taste. In small quantities, black malt {{can also be used to}} darken beer to a desired color, sometimes as a substitute for caramel color.

This study tested the effects of time of seed harvest, <b>kilning</b> <b>temperature</b> at seed extraction and irrigation treatments applied to E. globulus trees on seed germination traits. Seeds were harvested from three genotypes at 11 months from commencement of flowering (early), 13 months (commercial) and 15 months (late) and kiln dried at 30, 40 or 50 C. Irrigation treatments were full irrigation, half irrigation and no irrigation. Six traits describing the proportion and rate of seed germination and early seedling development were studied. The <b>kilning</b> <b>temperature</b> of capsules and irrigation treatments applied to trees had no effect on the germination traits studied.

40|$|Despite of a well kept {{tradition}} over {{centuries to}} use oat as malted {{raw material for}} wort and beer production today this brewing cereal has been displaced almost completely. Ten different oat varieties where examined for their acceptability as brewing cereals and malted. The most favourable sample has even been used to brew different types of beer in pilot scale. The pilot maltings of these samples {{have been done in}} a 1 kg scale with 45 % moisture content, isotherm at 14, 5 °C (8 and 9 d vegetation time) and with a <b>kilning</b> <b>temperature</b> of 80 °C/ 3 h. The beer was brewed either in a 1, 5 kg or a 10 kg pilot plant. In both cases a lauter tun was used for solid-liquid-separation. Hot break was separated with a whirlpool. The wort was pitched at 10 °C with top fermenting wheat beer yeast (< 5 % dead cells, methylenblue-test) which was been cultivated several times in oat wort. After three days of main fermentation a maturation step at 16 °C and a two week storage time at 0 °C followed. The resulting beers have not been stabilised or filtered. The varieties differed only little. The malt with the extended malting time of one day demonstrated better levels of enzymatic activities and modification. Therefore the batch which was used for the brewing trials was malted with nine day vegetation time. All ten oat varieties had low levels of extract caused by the high level of husk material, which requires quite high proportion of water for mashing. The high portion of fatty acids was degraded only to a small amount. The low foam levels could be explained by the presence of fatty acids since they are not assimilated completely by the yeast. In addition fatty acids {{have a negative effect on}} flavour stability. In comparison to barley malt oat malt have considerably lower levels of enzymatic activity. On this account the enzymatic rests during mashing where noticeable laboured. Saccharification and lautering took place in a fast way. Main fermentation, maturation and storage ran smooth and efficient. All three beer types produced (Schank-, Voll- und Starkbier) offered a pleasant top fermenting aroma which still differ from the familiar southern german wheat beer aroma. The trials demonstrate that the cereal oat does contain a potential to produce a drinkable pleasing beer. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|E

40|$|Much {{attention}} has been recently devoted to sensorially active substances affecting beer quality in the Czech Republic and worldwide. Among them, the heterocyclic and sulphur containing compounds play an important role, some of them with high sensorial activity even in extremely low concentrations. Trace amounts of these compounds, which can be frequently found in foods, participate in formation of their aroma and this effect can be generally evaluated as favorable However, in malt or beer it is true only to a limited extent {{and the presence of}} heterocyclic and sulphur containing compounds are in this respect assessed rather unfavorably. The aim {{of the present study was}} to provide a survey about of problems in the field of sulphur containing compounds in barley, malt and beer, to describe metabolic paths leading to their formation and to verify experimentally possibilities of their determination using modern analytical methods. Sulphur-containing amino acids are a natural part of barley, malt and beer and are precursors of the origin of volatile sulphur substances. The most frequently occurring sulphur amino acids, metionine, cysteine and homocysteine, were selected for analytical monitoring. The method of gas chromatography was used to determine sulphur-containing amino acids in barley, malt and beer. Prior to the analysis, sulphur-containing amino acids were derived and volatile N(O,S) -ethoxycarbonyl propyl esters were formed; they were subsequently analyzed using the gas chromatography with mass detector (GC/ MSD) and the gas chromatography with flame photo detector (GC/ FPD). Direct analysis of sulphur volatile substances is possible only rarely as they are found in the analyzed matrices (malt, beer) only in very low concentrations (g/kg,l - ng/kg,l). Before the analysis, the analytes must be extracted from the matrix and concentrated. The modern analytical methods SPME (Solid Phase Micro Extraction), SPDE (Solid Phase Dynamic Extraction) and TDAS (Thermal Desorption Autosampler) were experimentally compared for the extraction and subsequent concentration of sulphur volatile substances. The method of gas chromatography with flame photo detector was used to determine sulphur volatile substances. Following volatile sulphur substances were monitored: dimethyl sulphide, dimethyl disulphide, dimethyl trisulphide, carbon disulphide, ethyl sulphide, diethyl disulphide, methionol, 3 -methylthiophen, ethyl thioacetate, 2 -methyl- 1 -buthanthiol. Only metionine was detected in significant amounts in the barley samples analyzed. Not only content but also dependence on a variety and locality were studied. Further, changes in methionine, cysteine and PDMS content during malting were followed. Results proved a significant decline in these substances content depending on the <b>kilning</b> <b>temperature.</b> Three types of fibers were tested for the analyses of the selected volatile sulphur substances in beer in the SPME method. PEG - a fiber with stationary phase Carbowax, PDMS - a fiber with stationary phase polydimethylsiloxan and a combined fiber CAR/PDMS - Carboxen and polydimethylsiloxan. Carbon disulphide, methionol, dimethyl sulphide, 3 -methylthiophen and diethyl disulphide were detected with this method. Content of the other analyzed volatile sulphur substances was below the limit of detection. Further was tested usage the SPDE and TDAS methods. Both methods appear to be the suitable for the determination of volatile sulphur substances in beer...|$|E
40|$|Eucalyptus globulus {{is widely}} planted in {{pulpwood}} plantations in temperate {{regions of the}} world, including Australia. Most plantations are established from seedlings rather than clones. Slow and uneven germination of E. globulus seed-lots {{has been a problem}} in some nurseries and has been linked with periods of high temperatures. Trials were conducted using commercial and research seed-lots to identify genetic and environmental factors affecting seed germination. Six response traits were studied: proportion germination, proportion of normal seedlings, proportion of germinated seeds which developed into normal seedlings, germination rate, normal seedling development rate, and rate of development from germination to normal seedlings. First, the response of genetically diverse commercial seed-lots across a range of temperatures was studied. Temperatures above 30 °C generally delayed germination, reduced total germination percentage, caused a high proportion of seed death and suppressed the development of normal seedlings. Low temperatures also delayed germination but caused less seed mortality. The optimum temperature for rate of normal seedling development was between 24. 8 °C and 25. 5 °C and for maximum percentage normal seedling development was between 21. 2 °C and 24. 8 °C. The cardinal temperatures for normal seedling development were between 9. 1 °C and 10. 5 °C at low temperature and between 40. 3 °C and 41. 4 °C at high temperature. Despite general consistency in responses there was evidence that seed-lots can exhibit a differential response to temperature, particularly for normal seedling development at the extremes of temperature tested. Second, by sampling from multiple randomised ramets (trees) of maternal genotypes in grafted seed orchards across two sites and two seasons, the extent of maternal genetic regulation at the race and genotype level of seed germination responses was assessed. Maternal genotype had a significant effect on most germination traits but a differential response to temperature was only detected for percent germination and rate of development from germination into normal seedlings. The maternal genotype effect on germination traits varied with sampling season and site, suggesting interaction with environment or harvesting factors. The maternal genotype effect could be explained by maternal race of origin for two traits relating to normal seedling development. Differences between genotypes at 25 °C could be used to predict differences at 37 °C and germination rate and normal seedling development rate were generally the most correlated between 25 °C and 37 °C. Third, by using a small diallel crossing design it was shown that both the paternal and maternal parent can affect the germination response, arguing for at least some influence of the nuclear genotype of the embryo. However, the response to high temperature stress was more influenced by the maternal than paternal parent. These results argue that while the nuclear genotype of the embryo may cause variation in the average germination response, it is the maternal genetic effect that affects the response to high temperature stress. This shows that in addition to maternal environment and maturation effects, there may be additive genetic as well as maternal genetic effects on seed germination responses of E. globulus which may affect the proportion and synchrony of seed germination and development. E. globulus has a mixed mating system, and in a separate experiment, comparing seeds from self-pollination, open-pollination and mass-supplementary pollination the germination and development of selfed seeds were poorer than the open-pollinated and mass-supplementary pollinated seeds averaged across temperatures. There was also the suggestion that selfed seeds were more sensitive to high temperature stress. Fourth, the effect of time of seed harvest, <b>kilning</b> <b>temperature</b> at seed extraction and irrigation treatments applied to trees on the germination of E. globulus seeds and the germination response of seeds was tested at 25 °C, 32 °C and 37 °C. Seeds were harvested from three genotypes at 11 months from commencement of flowering (early), 13 months (commercial) and 15 months (late). Kilning temperatures were 30 °C, 40 °C and 50 °C. Irrigation treatments were full irrigation, half irrigation and no irrigation. The kilning temperatures of capsules and irrigation treatments applied to trees had no effect on the germination traits studied. Time of seed harvest affected the rates of seed germination and normal seedling development. There was little delay in germination rate at 32 °C in early harvested seeds compared with that experienced by the commercially and late harvested seeds, suggesting that it has a higher temperature threshold. The effect of harvest date on germination was genotype dependent and it is suggested that variability in seed germination traits between harvest dates may be related to different heat sums which seeds are exposed to during development. The outcomes from this work have significant industry application. Seed germination and seedling development in the nursery could be significantly enhanced by accounting for tree genetics, maternal environment and harvesting factors including seed harvest site, season and age...|$|E

30|$|In Figs.  2, 3 and 5 the {{presence}} of anatase is clearly observed with characteristic bands at 638, 398 and 143  cm− 1 [18]. Anatase is {{a component of the}} kaolin china clay and is a strong Raman scatterer; it is converted to rutile at temperatures ranging from 400 to 1200  °C and therefore its presence provides a good estimate of <b>kiln</b> <b>temperatures</b> [19 – 22]. Although it is recorded in the literature of artists’ pigments that anatase is a twentieth century pigment, its presence in ancient Chinese porcelains as a component of kaolin is well-founded from Raman spectroscopic data [23, 24]. Further evidence to support that shards # 1 and # 3 were subjected to lower <b>kiln</b> firing <b>temperatures</b> is {{the presence}} of β-wollastonite in the porcelain body [3, 25] with bands observed at ~ 971, 638 and 340  cm− 1. β-Wollastonite is a characteristic marker used to discrimination between soft- and hard-paste porcelains. To date there is no literature which cites {{the presence of}} β-wollastonite in Ming Dynasty (1368 – 1644 AD) period porcelain; although it has been found in a range of other samples including sixteenth century Medici [8] {{as well as a number}} of eighteenth and nineteenth century French porcelains [3, 25].|$|R

40|$|Increased use of {{alternative}} fuels in cement kilns {{is a trend}} in the world. However, replacing fossil fuels like coal with different alternative fuels will give various impacts on the overall kiln process due to the fuel characteristics. Hence, {{it is important to}} know to what extent the fossil fuels can be replaced by different alternative fuels without severely changing process conditions, product quality or emissions. In the present study, a mass and energy balance for the combustion of different alternative fuels in a cement rotary kiln was developed. First, the impact of different fuel characteristics on <b>kiln</b> gas <b>temperature,</b> <b>kiln</b> gas flow rate and air requirement were observed by using coal (reference case), meat and bone meal (MBM), two different wood types, refuse derived fuel and a mixture of saw dust and solid hazardous waste as the primary fuel. It was found that the key process parameters depend largely on the chemical characteristics of the fuel. It appears that MBM shows quite different results from other alternative fuels investigated. Next, simulation of combustion of a mixture of coal and MBM in the main burner was carried out in three steps. The first step was combustion of replacing part of coal energy with MBM, and a reduction in <b>kiln</b> exhaust gas <b>temperature</b> compared to the coal reference case was found. In the second step, the fuel feed rate was increased in order to raise the <b>kiln</b> gas <b>temperature</b> to that of the reference case. In the third step, the fuel feed rate and the clinker production rate were changed in order to have not only the same <b>kiln</b> gas <b>temperature</b> but also to obtain the same volumetric flow rate of total exhaust gas from the precalciner as in the reference case. Around 7 % of reduction in clinker production rate could be observed when replacing 48 % of the coal energy input. Results from a full-scale test using the same mixture of coal and MBM verified the simulation results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} application of fuzzy neural network control system for the rotary cement kiln system. Due to the dynamic characteristics and reaction process parameters are with features of large inertia, pure hysteresis, nonlinearity and strong coupling, the fuzzy neural network controller combining both the advantages of neural network and fuzzy control was applied. The fuzzy neural network is an adaptive control process whose parameters can be adjusted by learning algorithms automatically which is aimed to eliminate the shortcomings of conventional control methods. The main control system structure includes mainly the pressure control loop, the burning zone control loop and the back-end of <b>kiln</b> <b>temperature</b> control loop. Simulation results show {{the effectiveness of the}} control scheme with satisfied dynamic performances on response time and overshoot...|$|R
40|$|The main process {{objective}} of lime kiln operation {{is to produce}} a uniform quality lime. Additional operating objectives include minimizing fuel consumption and complying with environmental regulations. Given the long process delays and variable interaction inherent to lime kilns, these objectives are extremely difficult to achieve under manual or standard closed-loop kiln operation. A predictive control algorithm, MACS TM (Multivariable Advanced Control System) has been successfully applied to a Scandinavian kiln. A significant reduction in process variability has been achieved while simultaneously extending the operating life of the refractory. In addition to the <b>kiln</b> <b>temperature</b> profile, flue gas oxygen and CO are also explicitly regulated by the controller. By sustaining stable kiln operation at the process limits, the advanced controller is able to minimize energy use while ensuring safe combustion conditions are maintained...|$|R
