5|$|After initial cutting, {{the diamond}} is shaped in {{numerous}} stages of polishing. Unlike cutting, {{which is a}} responsible but quick operation, polishing removes material by gradual erosion and is extremely time consuming. The associated technique is well developed; it is considered as a routine and can be performed by technicians. After polishing, the diamond is reexamined for possible <b>flaws,</b> either remaining or induced by the process. Those <b>flaws</b> are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques, such as repolishing, crack filling, or clever arrangement of the stone in the jewelry. Remaining non-diamond inclusions are removed through laser drilling and filling of the voids produced.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, Lifted Wavelet Transform (LWT) and BP {{neural network}} {{are used for}} {{automatic}} <b>flaw</b> classification of pipeline girth welds. LWT is proposed to extract <b>flaw</b> feature from ultrasonic echo signals, ideally matched local characteristics of original signal and increasing the computational speed and <b>flaw</b> classification efficiency. After extracting features of all <b>flaw</b> echoes, a feature library is constructed. A modified BP neural network is followed as a classifier, trained by the library. When feature of any <b>flaw</b> echo is extracted and sent to BP network, <b>flaw</b> type is the output, realizing automatic <b>flaw</b> classification. Experiment results prove the proposed method, LWT with BP neural network, is more fit for automatic <b>flaw</b> classification than traditional methods...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{commercial}} manufacture, the permeation <b>flaw</b> detection is always used to inspect the surface quality of production. In conventional permeation <b>flaw</b> detection, the fluorescence or none fluorescence penetrant infiltrate {{the surface of the}} work and the developed image is used for <b>flaw</b> detection. The infiltration capacity of penetrant is very important to permeation <b>flaw</b> detection. If the <b>flaw</b> of the work isn’t infiltrated by the penetrant adequately, the permeation <b>flaw</b> detection will not work well. In this paper, the penetration theory of <b>flaw</b> is analyzed. The influential factors of infiltration capacity are discussed. The expression of the infiltration rate of capillary liquid column and the expression of the penetrant climb of <b>flaw</b> model are deducted. We have observed that, besides the physical property of material, the infiltration capacity of penetrant has a relationship with the atmosphere, the depth, width, spatial location of the <b>flaw</b> and whether the <b>flaw</b> is breakthrough. The conclusions of this paper are beneficial to improve the sensitivity of the permeation <b>flaw</b> detection...|$|R

Conventional {{methods for}} {{reducing}} the pulsed thermographic responses of delaminations tend to overestimate {{the size of the}} <b>flaw.</b> Since the heat diffuses in the plane parallel to the surface, the resulting temperature profile over the <b>flaw</b> is larger than the <b>flaw.</b> A variational method is presented {{for reducing the}} thermographic data to produce an estimated size for the <b>flaw</b> that is much closer to the true size of the <b>flaw.</b> The size is determined from the spatial thermal response of the exterior surface above the <b>flaw</b> and a constraint on the length of the contour surrounding the <b>flaw.</b> The technique is applied to experimental data acquired on a flat bottom hole composite specimen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{light of}} the {{characteristic}} of thin-wall weld joint in X-ray image, Flaw-edge extraction algorithm and image enhancement algorithm {{which is based on}} mathematical morphology are proposed in the study of <b>flaw</b> extraction technique. Therefore, the area of <b>flaw</b> and background can be removed successfully. On this basis, there are two algorithms to identify different <b>flaw</b> types: one is that spatial domain transform to extract <b>flaw</b> edge for clack, the other one is mathematical morphology which is combined with iteration threshold to extract <b>flaw</b> edge for pore; Experimental results show that both of algorithms can implement <b>flaw</b> extraction and segmentation automatically, which is lay a good foundation for <b>flaw</b> feature parameter extraction and recognition...|$|R

50|$|The Way's {{geometry}} {{also gave}} rise to the <b>Flaw</b> - as superspace geometry of the field boundary was extended infinitely, so the folded geodesics of the field unfold in the geometric centre of the Way to form a singularity. This singularity, the <b>Flaw,</b> rests within the Way's plasma tube (which in turn is sustained by the <b>Flaw).</b> The <b>Flaw</b> 'produces' gravity by actively repulsing matter away from itself in an acceleration at the square of the distance away from itself. In addition, any object encircling the <b>Flaw,</b> and then exerting pressure against it, experiences this pressure as a translation force along the <b>Flaw's</b> length perpendicular to the direction of force. The motion thus induced is controllable by the angle at which an annular ring enclosure is pressed against the <b>Flaw.</b> The same spatial transform also can be used to turn tip turbines in order to generate electricity. The <b>Flaw</b> permits a violation of the First Law of Thermodynamics, therefore defining the Way as a perpetual motion machine of the First Order, making energy out of nothing.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown in other papers in this volume (1, 2) that the {{application}} of deconvolution, diffraction, and attenuation corrections to received ultrasonic signals is sufficient to extract the absolute value of the <b>flaw</b> scattering amplitude from the signal. This capability provides a new opportunity to obtain additional <b>flaw</b> characterization information from the ultrasonic signal. More specifically, it is postulated upon reasonable grounds that the absolute magnitude of the front surface ultrasonic echo from a <b>flaw</b> can be related to both the <b>flaw</b> dimensions and its acoustic impedance. Assuming that the size can be obtained by other means, the front surface echo can then be utilized to help identify the <b>flaw.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} thus twofold: 1) to utilize the diffraction and attenuation corrections developed by Thompson and Gray (3) to obtain absolute values of <b>flaw</b> impulse responses, and 2) to investigate the feasibility of using absolute values of front surface echoes to determine a <b>flaw’s</b> identity...|$|R

5|$|A {{short run}} of Gran Trak systems was {{produced}} in March 1974 and revealed other design problems, such as the steering controls; in their prototype system, Eigen used real a real car steering wheel and pedals, but the production run used different parts. Alcorn returned to Cyan that month and redesigned the game to fix the <b>flaws</b> and use more standard parts; the copying protection scheme was changed to use a custom-designed integrated circuit that was named {{the same as a}} standard Texas Instruments integrated circuit. Alcorn later stated in an interview that neither Warman nor Emmons understood the challenges in converting a prototype design to a product that could be manufactured. The game entered production soon after, and Atari announced it was shipping a full production run in May 1974. Although the design <b>flaws</b> were fixed, the communication problems during development led to one final problem with the game: Atari was unclear on the actual cost of producing the game. As a result, a single Gran Trak game ended up costing US$1,095 to manufacture, while Atari was selling them to distributors for only $995, losing $100 per sale. Atari soon corrected the problem, but ended the fiscal year with a large loss {{due in part to the}} financial failure of the game.|$|E
