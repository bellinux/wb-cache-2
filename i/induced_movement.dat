500|$|About 525 {{million years}} ago, when {{northern}} Arizona {{was at the}} bottom of a shallow sea, a thin layer of sediment called the Tapeats Sandstone was deposited over the Cleopatra tuff. Limestones and other sediments accumulated above the sandstone until about 70 million years ago when the Laramide Orogeny created new mountains and new faults in the region. One of these faults, the Verde Fault, runs directly under Jerome along the Jerome anticline. Crustal stretching beginning about 15 million years ago created Basin and Range topography in central and southern Arizona, caused volcanic activity near Jerome, and <b>induced</b> <b>movement</b> along the Verde Fault. This movement exposed the tip of the United Verde ore body at one place on Cleopatra Hill and moved the UVX ore body to [...] below the surface. Basalt, laid down between 15 and 10 million years ago, covers the surface beneath the UVX headframes and Jerome State Historic Park.

Recently, constraint <b>induced</b> <b>movement</b> therapy {{has been shown to}} be an effective rehabilitation technique at varying stages of stroke recovery to improve upper limb motor function and use during daily activities of living. The greatest gains are seen among persons with stroke who exhibit some wrist and finger extension in the effected limb. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and brain imaging studies have demonstrated that the brain undergoes plastic changes in function and structure in patients that perform constraint <b>induced</b> <b>movement</b> therapy. These changes accompany the gains in motor function of the paretic upper limb. However, there is no established causal link between observed changes in brain function/structure and the motor gains due to constraint <b>induced</b> <b>movement</b> therapy.|$|E

5000|$|The {{principles}} of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) used in stroke patients {{are based on}} the idea of the reversal of learned non-use. [...] CIMT uses constrained movement of the less-affected limb and intensive training of the paretic arm to counter-condition the nonuse of the more-affected arm learned in the acute and early sub-acute periods. More recently, clinical versions of CIMT - called [...] "modified constraint <b>induced</b> <b>movement</b> therapy" [...] (mCIT) - have been produced that are administered over a longer time period than CIMT (usually 10 weeks). While offering the same effectiveness and cortical changes as CIMT, these versions are better tolerated, and can be integrated into traditional therapy clinics and reimbursement parameters.|$|E

In those fifteen years, his accomplishments were considerable, including, for example, the directorship of the school's prestigious graduate program in psychology; the co-founding of an influential journal about perceptual psychology, titled Psychologische Forschung (Psychological Research: Journal of Psychology and its Neighboring Fields); and the authorship of an early book titled Gestalt Psychology (1929), written especially for an American audience. During the 1920s and early 1930s psychology reached a high point at the institute. Aside from Köhler, many other influential minds were at work. Max Wertheimer was part of the institute from 1916 to 1929, until he left to take a position in Frankfurt. In addition, Kurt Lewin remained at the institute until 1933 (the year of his resignation). Köhler also had many well-known assistants at the institute, including Karl Duncker, whose work revolved around problem solving and <b>induced</b> <b>movement.</b> Von Lauenstein, another assistant of Köhler, is known mainly for his investigation of time errors and memory.

The town is underlain by 88 mi of mine shafts.

The United Verde open pit, about 300 ft deep, is on the edge of town next to Cleopatra Hill. The side of the pit consists of Precambrian gabbro.

Aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of modified constraint <b>induced</b> <b>movement</b> therapy on weight bearing & protective extension in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Methods: 21 hemiplegic children were selected and randomly divided into experimental and control groups. Common Practices of Occupational Therapy applied for 6 weeks in both groups equally and test group received constrain <b>induced</b> <b>movement</b> therapy for three hours every day. Weight-bearing and protective extension was measured based on quality of test skills of upper limbs (QUEST). Data analyzed using appropriated statistical methods.

In this report, we investigate whether peripheral trauma can lead to movement disorders and describe the relationship between peripheral injury and movement disorders in four cases. Conclusions Injury was serious enough to develop involuntary abnormal movements with pain and the latency between injury and the onset of movements in all of cases was less than 1 year.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the immediate effects of constraint <b>induced</b> <b>movement</b> therapy technique using wedge on symmetry index as well as the short-term effects of this technique on functional balance of chronic hemiparesis patients. Materials and Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, twenty-one hemiparesis patients by mean age of 54. 28 (± 10. 06) and the mean passed duration of injury 50. 14 (± 36. 48) months were selected by simple non-probability method. The symmetry index was measured in three conditions: non-wedge, wedge 5 ºand wedge 7. 5 º. Also, functional balance of patients was measured with Functional Reach (FR) and Timed Up and Go (TUG) tests before and after using of short-term constraint <b>induced</b> <b>movement</b> therapy technique. Results: According to the results of this study, symmetry index difference was significant in both wedge 5 º and wedge 7. 5 º conditions compared with no-wedge condition (p< 0. 001), while it was not significant between wedge 5 º and wedge 7. 5 º conditions.

40|$|Graphene {{is a very}} {{promising}} material for nanoelectronics applications due to its unique and remarkable electronic and thermal properties. However, when deposited on metallic electrodes the overall thermal conductivity is significantly decreased.

Experimentally, one way to improve the graphene/metal contact is thorough high-temperature annealing, but the detailed mechanisms behind these processes remain unclear. In order to address these questions, we carried out fully atomistic reactive molecular dynamics simulations using the ReaxFF force field to investigate the interactions between multi-layer graphene and metallic electrodes (nickel) under (thermal) annealing. Our results show that the annealing <b>induces</b> an upward-downward <b>movement</b> of the graphene layers, causing a pile-driver-like effect over the metallic surface.
