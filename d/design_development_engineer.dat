30|$|In summary, we have {{demonstrated}} the shape controlled biosynthesis of gold nanotriangles using endophytic fungi Aspergillus clavatus, isolated from surface sterilized stem tissues of Azadirachta indica A.

It was also observed that the synthesis of gold nanotriangles are extracellular and showing a high aspect ratio. The study reported herein serve as a unique single-step green protocol for the generation and stabilization of nontoxic gold nanotriangles (GNT), exploitable in a myriad of diagnostic and therapeutic applications. A. clavatus induced synthesis of GNT will provide unprecedented opportunities towards the <b>design</b> and <b>development</b> of <b>engineered</b> 'green' gold nanotriangles that can be widely utilized in biomedical applications.|$|R
40|$|Periodically {{one needs}} to re-examine the {{objectives}} and the efforts associated with a field of study. In the case of surety which comprises, safety, security and reliability {{one needs to}} be sure that theoretical efforts support the needs of systems and design engineers in satisfying stakeholder requirements. The current focus in the surety areas does not appear to address the theoretical foundations needed by the systems engineer. Examination of papers and abstracts demonstrate significant effort along the lines of thermal hydraulics, chemistry, structural response, control theory, etc. which are analytical disciplines which provide support for a surety theoretic but do not constitute a theoretic. The representations currently employed, fault trees etc., define static representations of a system, not the dynamic representation characteristic of response in abnormal, hostile or under degrading conditions. Current methodologies would require a semi-infinite set of scenarios to be examined before a system could be certified as satisfying a surety requirement. The elements that are required of a surety theoretic must include: (1) a dynamic representation of the system; (2) the ability to automatically identify terminal states of the system; and (3) determine the probabilities of specified terminal states under dynamic conditions. This paper examines the requirements of a surety theoretic that will support the efforts of the <b>design</b> and <b>development</b> <b>engineer.</b> Speculations then follow on technologies that might provide the theoretical and support foundations needed by the systems engineering community to form a robust surety analysis and design environment...|$|R
50|$|The final {{development}} of the Velocette KTT, the Mk VIII KTT was introduced in 1938 at that year's Earls Court Show, {{and was the first}} motorcycle to use the now-conventional swinging-arm rear fork with a shock absorber unit (in this case, an oleo-pneumatic unit built by the Oleo Strut Co. of England). The rear suspension system was <b>designed</b> by Veloce <b>development</b> <b>engineer</b> Harold Willis, and was inspired by the Oleo strut landing gear on the DeHavilland Hornet he borrowed at the Midland Aero Club, while his beloved DeHavilland 'Moth' was undergoing repair. Contact with the Oleo company led to several pairs of air shocks built for Veloce in 1936, for which the factory's racing rigid-frame racers (similar to the Mark VII KTT) were adapted with a swinging-fork rear end and bolt-on subframe for the seat. The experimental first swinging-arms used an adapted steering head lug turned sideways, with the cup-and-cone bearings retained. Production Mark VIII KTTs used a more conventional bronze bush and trunnion shaft pivot for the one-piece rear fork. The first experimental swing-arm machines were raced by the factory in the 1937 season, and introduced as the Mark VIII KTT the next year, for sale to the public.|$|R

40|$|Material {{selection}} {{is a very}} critical design decision, which has a profound influence on the entire development program for rocket motor cases. In the selection process, the main performance parameters and the most appropriate fabrication technology with proven processes must be considered. Many years of practical experience in material selection process with {{a thorough understanding of}} materials behavior under various loading environments and hands-on experiences with various available manufacturing processes are of immense help to the <b>design</b> and <b>development</b> <b>engineer</b> for successful completion of the development program. In this paper, an attempt has been made to present an approach for selecting appropriate material and manufacturing process for rocket motor case based on method of Weighted Performance Index (WPI) with the hope that this approach will also provide additional aid to the design engineer for the selection of material and manufacturing process for rocket motor cases. In this method, different properties are assigned a certain weight depending upon their importance to the service requirements. Different properties are normalized using a scaling factor, and finally a weighted property index is computed. The material that scored the maximum numerical value is chosen as the material for fabrication. This approach closely matches with the actual performance. Maraging steel and D 6 AC are found to be the preferred materials for rocket motor cases for critical missions. HSLA steels are appropriate for less-critical applications, in which rocket motor cases are required in very large numbers (e. g., flow-formed AISI 4130 motor cases([8])). For the selection of an appropriate manufacturing method, the major parameters considered are dimensional accuracy, cost of production, minimum material waste, and flexibility in design. Again, these properties are given a relative grading, which is then converted into a scaled property. Finally, the weighted performance indices are estimated. The flow-forming method has emerged as the manufacturing method of choice for motor tubes...|$|R
