40|$|<b>Isostatic</b> <b>networks</b> are {{minimally}} {{rigid and}} therefore have, generically, nonzero elastic moduli. Regular <b>isostatic</b> <b>networks</b> have finite moduli in {{the limit of}} large sizes. However, numerical simulations show that all elastic moduli of geometrically disordered <b>isostatic</b> <b>networks</b> go to zero with system size. This holds true for positional as well as for topological disorder. In most cases, elastic moduli decrease as inverse power-laws of system size. On directed <b>isostatic</b> <b>networks,</b> however, of which the square and cubic lattices are particular cases, the decrease of the moduli is exponential with size. For these, the observed elastic weakening can be quantitatively described in terms of the multiplicative growth of stresses with system size, giving rise to bulk and shear moduli of order exp{-bL}. The case of sphere packings, which only accept compressive contact forces, is considered separately. It is argued that these have a finite bulk modulus because of specific correlations in contact disorder, introduced by the constraint of compressivity. We discuss why their shear modulus, nevertheless, is again zero for large sizes. A quantitative model is proposed that describes the numerically measured shear modulus, both {{as a function of the}} loading angle and system size. In all cases, if a density p> 0 of overconstraints is present, as when a packing is deformed by compression, or when a glass is outside its isostatic composition window, all asymptotic moduli become finite. For square networks with periodic boundary conditions, these are of order sqrt{p}. For directed networks, elastic moduli are of order exp{-c/p}, indicating the existence of an "isostatic length scale" of order 1 /p. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figues, to appear in Europhysics Letter...|$|R
40|$|The contact {{network of}} a {{frictionless}} polydisperse granular packing is isostatic in {{the limit of}} low applied pressure. It is argued here that, on disordered <b>isostatic</b> <b>networks,</b> displacement–displacement and stress–stress static Green functions are described by random multiplicative processes and have a truncated power-law distribution, with a cut-off that grows exponentially with distance. If the external pressure is increased sufficiently, excess contacts are created, the packing becomes hyperstatic, and the abovementioned anomalous properties disappear because Green functions now have a bounded distribution. Thus, the low-pressure, isostatic, limit is a critical point. Granular matter, isostaticity, response functions, stress distributions, multiplicative processes...|$|R

Here we show that by imposing suitable boundary conditions at the surface, the network can be rendered effectively isostatic. We refer to these as anchored boundary conditions. An important example is formed by a two-dimensional network of corner sharing triangles, which is the focus of this paper. Another way of rendering such <b>networks</b> <b>isostatic,</b> is by adding an external wire along which all unpinned vertices can slide (sliding boundary conditions).

Experimental results from the imaging of finite pieces at the atomic level needs such boundary conditions, if the observed structure is to be computer-refined so that the interior atoms have the perception of being in an infinite isostatic environment.

40|$|In {{a recent}} letter, Stenull and Lubensky claim that {{periodic}} approximants of Penrose tilings, which are generically isostatic, have a nonzero bulk modulus B when disordered, and, therefore, Penrose tilings are good models of jammed packings. The claim of a nonzero B, {{which is made}} on the basis of a normal mode analysis of periodic Penrose approximants for a single value of the disorder epsilon, is the central point of their letter: other properties of Penrose tilings, such as the vanishing of the shear modulus, and a flat density of vibrational states, are already shared by most geometrically disordered <b>isostatic</b> <b>networks</b> studied so far. In this comment, Conjugate Gradient is used to solve the elastic equations on approximants with up to 8 x 10 ^ 4 sites for several values of epsilon, to show beyond reasonable doubt that Stenull and Lubensky's claim is incorrect. The bulk modulus of generic Penrose tilings is zero asymptotically. According to our results, B grows as (epsilon^ 2 L^ 3) when (epsilon^ 2 L^ 3) > 10 ^ 2. Stenull and Lubensky seem to have only analyzed one value of epsilon for which saturation is reached at the largest size studied. This led them to a wrong conclusion. We support our results by also considering generic Penrose approximants with fixed boundaries, whose bulk modulus constitutes a strict upper bound for that of periodic systems, finding that these have a vanishing B as well for large L. We conclude that the main point in Stenull and Lubensky letter is unjustified. Penrose tilings are no better models of jammed packings than any of the previously studied <b>isostatic</b> <b>networks</b> with geometric disorder. Comment: 1 page. 4 subfigures.

The <b>network</b> <b>structures</b> can be inferred by the dynamical Bayesian network or Granger causality, but neither techniques have seriously taken into account the impact of environmental inputs. Results With considerations of natural rhythmic dynamics of biological data, we propose a system biology approach to reveal the impact of environmental inputs on <b>network</b> <b>structures.</b> We first represent the environmental inputs by a harmonic oscillator and combine them with Granger causality to identify environmental inputs and then uncover the causal <b>network</b> <b>structures.</b> We also generalize it to multiple harmonic oscillators to represent various exogenous influences.
