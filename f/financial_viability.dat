However, Manchester City Council {{did not have the}} money to facilitate movable seating and Manchester City were lukewarm about the idea. Stadium architects Arup Sport believed history demonstrated that maintaining a rarely used athletics track often does not work with football – and cited examples such as the Stadio delle Alpi and the Olympic Stadium with both Juventus and Bayern Munich moving to new stadiums less than 40 years after inheriting them.|$|E

Moreton came from Ford Motorsports where he led the team responsible for the Ford Sierra RS500 Cosworth, and was a project manager for the Ford RS200 Group B rally car program. Richard Owen was appointed chief designer, and the remainder of the team was made up of Jaguar and TWR staff, including Pete Dodd, {{the only member of the}} group of twelve responsible for the XJ220 concept.

40|$|The rate of {{production}} of landfill gas (LFG) varies considerably from site to site. A major obstacle in determining the <b>financial</b> <b>viabilities</b> of proposed LFG utilisation schemes, for sites which are producing appreciable quantities of gas, is the current inability to forecast accurately the considered site's gas-production rate. In essence there are two techniques for determining a site's gas-production rate: 1. (1) The site's behaviour is modelled mathematically and the LFG production rate is predicted from {{the composition of the}} deposited waste and an understanding of how quickly the organic material decays to form LFG. 2. (2) Gas-extraction flows and associated gas-pressure measurements are taken at the site. The second technique is preferable because more-accurate estimates can be made as to the mass of LFG likely to be produced per day over the next decade. The present paper discusses two approaches for the implementation of the second technique, and makes recommendations with respect to procedure. ...|$|R

Because they are unsanctioned by the ICC, the teams do not have access to the best facilities across the whole country or access to the best players, limiting their ability to generate high gate revenues.
