5|$|Never shall I {{forget that}} nocturnal silence which {{deprived}} me, for all eternity, {{of the desire}} to live.

50|$|Never shall I {{forget that}} night, {{the first night}} in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky. Never shall I <b>forget</b> <b>those</b> flames which {{consumed}} my faith forever. Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I <b>forget</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.|$|R
60|$|She {{leaned forward}} {{so that the}} firelight fell upon the pages. Little strands of soft brown hair drooped over her face. In {{studying}} her, Philip almost forgot his own anxiety. He had known so few women, yet he had watched so many from afar off, endowed them with their natural qualities, built up their lives and tastes for them, and found them all so sadly wanting. To him, Elizabeth represented everything that was desirable in her sex, from the flowing lines of her beautiful body to the sympathy {{which seemed to be}} always shining out of her eyes. Notwithstanding her strength, she was so exquisitely and entirely feminine, a creature of silk and laces, free from any effort of provocativeness, yet subtly, almost clamorously human. He <b>forgot,</b> in <b>those</b> few <b>moments,</b> that she had become the arbitress of his material fate--that he was a humble author, watching the effect of his first attempts upon a mistress in her profession. He remembered only that she was the woman who was filling his life, stealing into every corner of it, permeating him with love, pointing him onwards towards a life indescribable, unrealisable....|$|R
