40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the spatial variation of temperature, relative humidity and black globe humidity temperature (BGHT) index in growing-finishing swine facilities, with and without evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler.</b> The experiment was conducted in a 60 x 9 m facility containing 32 pens of 3. 20 x 4. 00 m each, divided into two sectors. The treatments were without evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> (control) and with evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler.</b> Temperature and relative humidity data were collected weekly in two periods (morning and afternoon) at 32 different sampling points, encompassing the center of each pen and the outer perimeter of the facility. Animal performance variables were: feed intake, feed conversion, weight out of the nursery, slaughter weight, weight gain and daily weight gain. According to the results, the analyzed variables showed spatial dependence, with lower temperature and higher relative humidity in the evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> environment. However, evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> system provided better environment thermal conditions inside the facilities, lowering BGHT values, which were lower in the adiabatic cooling sector.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} chiller energy {{consumption}} {{in a central}} air-conditioning system, a heat exchanger, acting as an <b>air</b> <b>cooler,</b> can be installed before an air handling unit to pre-cool the fresh <b>air</b> by recovering <b>cooling</b> capacity from exhaust air. However, studies on evaluating the performances of <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> under condensation condition are limited. Therefore, an experimental {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the plate type <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> performance under four operating modes (dry/wet mode, low/high air humidity). Under dry operating mode, the <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> serves as a traditional air cooler; while under wet operating mode, it works as an indirect evaporative cooler (IEC). The cooler dynamic performances during different operating mode transition were investigated. The steady performances under different parameter influence were also comparatively studied. The results show that wet operating improves the sensible and latent <b>cooling</b> capacities of <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> significantly. Condensation takes place under high humidity inlet air, results in decreasing of sensible efficiency but increasing of latent efficiency and total heat transfer rate. The coefficient of performance (COP) of IEC is higher than that of traditional <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> under the same testing configuration. The highest COP can reach 9. 0 and achieved under wet operating mode with condensation. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
