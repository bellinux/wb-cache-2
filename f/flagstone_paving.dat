5000|$|In the 1930s, the building’s {{roof was}} re-built with asphalt and lead {{flashing}} to stop leaking. In 1961, <b>flagstone</b> <b>paving</b> {{was added to}} the interior floor and the exterior entry patio area. The entire structure was renovated in 2003. Despite the changes required over the years, the National Park Service has been careful to maintain the rustic look of the building. [...] Because of its architectural and historic significance, the Sinnott Memorial Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.|$|E
40|$|In March 1977, {{excavations}} {{were conducted}} in front of Alamo Shrine where <b>flagstone</b> <b>paving</b> was being replaced by the City of San Antonio. The subsurface investigations sampled and described the soil stratigraphy which has accumulated through 2. 5 centuries of occupation. The distinctive soil levels contained datable cultural materials which relate {{to some of the}} major events which took place from the earliest settlement of Mission San Antonio de Valero through subsequent periods of Spanish, Mexican, and Anglo-Texan occupations. The artifact collections have provided additional information on the material culture of the different ethnic and cultural groups to occupy the Alamo. During the excavations, a section of a trench was found in which a palisade had been set prior to the battle of 1836. The trench backfill contained numerous battle artifacts. Also a section of the old street curb which once extended along the front of the Alamo was uncovered. In addition, excavations in front of Alamo Shrine have provided an examination of the old church foundation and footing. This was found to be in good condition...|$|E
25|$|The family settings, having {{four or five}} {{circular}} divisions, encircle a <b>flagstone</b> <b>paved</b> yard {{where the}} doors of the different divisions converged. These central yards had an important role in family life as the area where the daily family activities took place. These nuclei would be closed by key, granting privacy to families.|$|R
5000|$|The lodge {{measures}} about 450 sq ft, and was financed {{primarily by}} a donor named Hall McAllister {{at a cost}} of $6,725. A caretaker is on duty during the summer months. The first caretaker (1923-1934) was Joseph Macatee [...] "Mac" [...] Olberman (1862-1946). With the help of volunteers, Olberman built a 950 yard long <b>flagstone</b> <b>paved</b> path leading uphill from Horse Camp to facilitate access to the Avalanche Gulch climbing route. [...] This structure still exists and is known as Olberman's Causeway.|$|R
50|$|Construction of the Condado Vanderbilt {{began in}} 1917 by Frederick William Vanderbilt, {{the son of}} William Henry Vanderbilt. He {{selected}} the prominent architectural firm of Warren and Whitmore—which designed New York City’s Grand Central Station, {{as well as the}} Biltmore, Commodore, and Ambassador Hotels—to design the Condado Vanderbilt Hotel. On 16 October 1919, the hotel, having cost a million dollars to construct, was inaugurated. It was suggested that the early Spanish Revival style architecture be used by Fredrick Vanderbilt. Capitalizing on the property’s setting adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean, the designers created a Beaux Arts-style structure with white walls, red tiles, French windows, lofty ceilings and other design details typical of the style at the time. The original roofing featured antique Spanish tiles sourced from Puerto Rico's older Spanish buildings. The floors and the public areas including the main staircase were decorated with marble and mosaics and the area between the ocean and the hotel building was developed to help the building withstand damage from the Atlantic coast. The hotel also featured a <b>flagstone</b> <b>paved</b> terrace. Giant pandanus, several kinds of bougainvillae, fruit trees and coconut palms could also be found in the hotel's gardens.|$|R
5000|$|Through archaeological and anthropological excavations, it is {{possible}} to report on building materials and possible methods used {{in the construction of the}} Israelite four roomed houses. The Iron I four-room houses typically measured ten to twelve meters long and eight to ten meters wide. The floor plan consists of three vertical rooms, connected by one “broadroom" [...] at the rear of the building. Although a majority of houses were not found standing, through analysis it can be concluded that some houses stood two-stories tall. Not all four roomed houses were stand-alone houses in the typical American sense. While some houses were found in isolation, other houses were found with shared walls, and even shared the back broadroom wall with a thicker, outer, defensive city wall. The houses could be constructed in a circular pattern, where the outer city wall connected all back broadroom walls, such as in a combination of the casemate wall and the residential wall. The normal walls were around one meter thick, and were constructed of fieldstones. The exterior defensive walls were thicker. The surfaces of exterior walls were likely plastered to prevent erosion from rainfall, which could be heavy and intense in the winter and spring of the region. The plastering would have demanded a significant quantity of lime to be manufactured, which required a kiln. This is supported by Byzantine kilns found in the Tall al ‘Umayri region, dug in the ground and lined with stones. The floors were composed of beaten earth and <b>paved</b> <b>flagstone.</b> Finely layered ash and clay helped keep the floors smooth and level. As seen by the sheer volume and weight of all of the stones, wooden pillars, and mudbrick walls used in the construction of the four roomed house, it can be said that construction was a team effort that took a lot of energy.|$|R
