5|$|In many species, fleas are principally a {{nuisance}} to their hosts, causing an itching sensation {{which in turn}} causes the host to try to remove the pest by biting, pecking or scratching. Fleas are not simply a source of annoyance, however. Flea bites cause a slightly raised, swollen itching spot to form; this has a single puncture point at the centre, like a mosquito bite. Besides this, the <b>eczematous</b> itchy skin disease flea allergy dermatitis is common in many host species, including dogs and cats. The bites often appear in clusters or lines of two bites, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards. Fleas can lead to hair loss {{as a result of}} frequent scratching and biting by the animal, and can cause anemia in extreme cases.|$|E
25|$|There are eczemas {{overlaid}} by viral infections (eczema herpeticum or vaccinatum), and eczemas {{resulting from}} underlying disease (e.g., lymphoma). Eczemas originating from ingestion of medications, foods, and chemicals, {{have not yet}} been clearly systematized. Other rare <b>eczematous</b> disorders exist in addition to those listed here.|$|E
25|$|Hypersensitive {{reactions}} to tattoos {{are known to}} lay latent for significant periods of time before exhibiting symptoms. Delayed abrupt chronic reactions, such as <b>eczematous</b> dermatitis, are known to manifest themselves from months {{to as many as}} twenty years after the patient received his or her most recent tattoo.|$|E
500|$|Neonatal {{herpes simplex}} is a HSV {{infection}} in an infant. It {{is a rare}} but serious condition, usually caused by vertical transmission of HSV-1 or -2) from mother to newborn. During immunodeficiency, herpes simplex can cause unusual lesions in the skin. [...] One {{of the most striking}} is the appearance of clean linear erosions in skin creases, with the appearance of a knife cut. Herpetic sycosis is a recurrent or initial herpes simplex infection affecting primarily the hair follicles. Eczema herpeticum is an infection with herpesvirus in patients with chronic atopic dermatitis may result in spread of herpes simples throughout the <b>eczematous</b> areas.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} dermal {{reactions}} to tattoo pigments are granulomas and various lichenoid diseases. [...] Other conditions noted have been cement dermatitis, collagen deposits, discoid lupus erythematosus, <b>eczematous</b> eruptions, hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis, and keloids.|$|E
2500|$|Autoeczematization (id {{reaction}}, autosensitization) is an <b>eczematous</b> {{reaction to}} an infection with parasites, fungi, bacteria, or viruses. It is completely curable with the clearance {{of the original}} infection that caused it. The appearance varies depending on the cause. It always occurs some distance away from the original infection. (ICD-10 L30.2) ...|$|E
5000|$|Also termed [...] "lip dermatitis", <b>eczematous</b> {{cheilitis}} is {{a diverse}} group of disorders which often have an unknown cause. Chronic <b>eczematous</b> reactions account for the majority of chronic cheilitis cases.|$|E
50|$|Doucas and Kapetanakis {{pigmented}} purpura is a {{skin condition}} characterized by scaly and <b>eczematous</b> patches, which also have petechiae and hemosiderin staining.|$|E
50|$|Protein contact {{dermatitis}} is a cutaneous condition, {{and was a}} term originally used to describe an <b>eczematous</b> reaction to protein-containing material in food handlers.|$|E
50|$|It {{is divided}} into {{endogenous}} (due to an inherent characteristic of the individual), and exogenous (where it is caused by an external agent). The main cause of endogenous <b>eczematous</b> cheilitis is atopic cheilitis (atopic dermatitis), and the main causes of exogenous <b>eczematous</b> cheilitis is irritant contact cheilitis (e.g., caused by a lip-licking habit) and allergic contact cheilitis. The latter {{is characterized by a}} dryness, fissuring, edema, and crusting. It affects females more commonly than males, in a ratio of about 9:1.|$|E
5000|$|Spongiosis {{is mainly}} {{intercellular}} edema (abnormal accumulation of fluid) in the epidermis, and {{is characteristic of}} <b>eczematous</b> dermatitis, manifested clinically by intraepidermal vesicles (fluid-containing spaces), [...] "juicy" [...] papules, and/or lichenification.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} dermal {{reactions}} to tattoo pigments are granulomas and various lichenoid diseases. Other conditions noted have been cement dermatitis, collagen deposits, discoid lupus erythematosus, <b>eczematous</b> eruptions, hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis, and keloids.|$|E
5000|$|Id {{reactions}} (also {{known as}} [...] "Disseminated eczema," [...] and [...] "Generalized eczema") present {{with a variety}} of infectious disorders, often occurring in response to an inflammatory tinea of the feet, resulting in an <b>eczematous</b> dermatitis.|$|E
5000|$|Pityriasis amiantacea (also {{known as}} [...] "Tinea amiantacea") is an <b>eczematous</b> {{condition}} of the scalp resulting in hair loss in which thick tenaciously adherent scale infiltrates and surrounds {{the base of a}} group of scalp hairs.|$|E
50|$|Autoimmune {{estrogen}} dermatitis presents as a cyclic skin disorder, {{that may}} appear <b>eczematous,</b> papular, bullous, or urticarial. with pruritus typically present, skin eruptions {{that may be}} chronic but which are exacerbated premenstrually or occur immediately following menses.|$|E
50|$|Presentations differ among causes, but T cell {{insufficiency}} generally manifests as unusually severe common viral infections (respiratory syncytial virus, rotavirus), diarrhea, and <b>eczematous</b> or erythrodermatous rashes. Failure {{to thrive}} and cachexia are later {{signs of a}} T-cell deficiency.|$|E
50|$|Flea allergy dermatitis, FAD, is an <b>eczematous</b> itchy {{skin disease}} of dogs and cats. For {{both of these}} {{domestic}} species, flea allergy dermatitis {{is the most common}} cause of skin disease. Affected animals develop allergic reactions to chemicals in flea saliva. Symptoms of this reaction include erythema (redness), papules (bumps), pustules (pus-filled bumps), crusts (scabs) also if severe, hair loss will occur in affected area. Dogs with flea allergy dermatitis often show hair loss and <b>eczematous</b> skin rash on the lower back, upper tail, neck and down the back of the legs. Cats with flea allergy dermatitis may develop a variety of skin problems, including feline eosinophilic granuloma, miliary dermatitis or self-inflicted alopecia from excessive grooming.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} used to treat chronic {{psoriasis}} vulgaris and non-infected acute <b>eczematous</b> dermatoses (eczema). One study demonstrated that 0.05% halometasone cream was more effective than 0.05% betamethasone cream in treating dermatitis, though both were well-tolerated with no systemic adverse effects reported.|$|E

50|$|Tuftsin {{deficiency}} {{can occur}} hereditary or following splenectomy, results in increased susceptibility to certain diseases e.g.: infected <b>eczematous</b> dermatitis with draining lymph nodes, otitis and sinusitis. Acquired tuftsin deficiency {{can occur in}} granulocyte leukemia, when blood neutrophils failed to show stimulation with synthetic tuftsin or with the serum leukokinin. Serum level of tuftsin was minimal or absent.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes termed [...] "photoaggravated", {{and divided}} into two categories, phototoxic and photoallergic, PCD is the <b>eczematous</b> {{condition}} which is triggered by an interaction between an otherwise unharmful or less harmful substance on the skin and ultraviolet light (320-400 nm UVA) (ESCD 2006), therefore manifesting itself only in regions where the sufferer has been exposed to such rays.|$|E
50|$|Photodermatitis, {{sometimes}} referred to as sun poisoning or photoallergy, is a form of allergic contact dermatitis in which the allergen must be activated by light to sensitize the allergic response, and to cause a rash or other systemic effects on subsequent exposure. The second and subsequent exposures produce photoallergic skin conditions which are often <b>eczematous.</b> In rare cases the victims die.|$|E
50|$|Autoimmune {{progesterone}} dermatitis {{may appear}} as urticarial papules, deep gyrate lesions, papulovesicular lesions, an <b>eczematous</b> eruption, or as targetoid lesions. Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis initially manifests with eye symptoms, e.g. burning, and progresses into rashes. Its relapsing-remitting pattern in women {{correspond to the}} progesterone levels during the menstrual cycle, which spike twice a month. It is an extremely rare disease, only perhaps 50 cases have ever been reported.|$|E
50|$|In a 2002 {{study for}} the {{treatment}} of warts, the responders consisted of 135 individuals (87.7%) that had complete clearance of warts. Reported adverse effects were local and included with pruritus (itching) (15.6%), with blistering (7.1%), and with <b>eczematous</b> reactions (eczema)(14.2%). The majority of the patients tolerated the treatment very well. One patient developed local impetigo (minor infection). Patients had an average of 5 treatments over a 6-month period.|$|E
50|$|Urushiol causes an <b>eczematous</b> contact {{dermatitis}} characterized by redness, swelling, papules, vesicles, blisters, and streaking. People vary greatly in their sensitivity to urushiol. In approximately 15% to 30% of people, urushiol does not trigger an immune system response, while at least 25% {{of people have}} a very strong immune response resulting in severe symptoms. Since the skin reaction is an allergic one, people may develop progressively stronger reactions after repeated exposures, or have no immune response on their first exposure but show sensitivity on subsequent exposures.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, 8% of {{children}} attending allergy clinics {{were found to}} be allergic to Ganoderma, a basidiospore. Pleurotus ostreatus, cladosporium, and Calvatia cyathiformis are significant airborne spores. Other significant fungal allergens include aspergillus and alternaria-penicillin families. In India Fomes pectinatus is a predominant air-borne allergen affecting up to 22 percent of patients with respiratory allergies. Some fungal air-borne allergens such as Coprinus comatus are associated with worsening of <b>eczematous</b> skin lesions. Children who are born during autumn months (during fungal spore season) are more likely to develop asthmatic symptoms later in life.|$|E
50|$|Nickel allergy {{results in}} a skin {{response}} (rash) after the skin comes in direct and sustained contact with any item which releases {{a large amount of}} free nickel from its surface. The skin reaction can occur at the site of contact, or sometimes spread beyond {{to the rest of the}} body. Cutaneous exposure can cause localized erythematous, pruritic, vesicular, and scaly patches. Ingestion of nickel may cause a systemic reaction, that will affect a larger skin surface. Examples of systemic reactions can include hand dermatitis, baboon syndrome, or generalized <b>eczematous</b> reactions.|$|E
5000|$|The IPEX {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} the development of overwhelming systemic autoimmunity {{in the first year of}} life, resulting in the commonly observed triad of watery diarrhea, <b>eczematous</b> dermatitis, and endocrinopathy seen most commonly as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Most individuals have other autoimmune phenomena including Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune neutropenia, and tubular nephropathy. The majority of affected males die within the first year of life of either metabolic derangements or sepsis. An analogous disease is also observed in a spontaneous Foxp3-mutant mouse known as [...] "scurfy".|$|E
5000|$|IPEX (immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked) {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} disease linked to the dysfunction of the transcription factor FOXP3, widely {{considered to be the}} master regulator of the regulatory T cell lineage. It leads to the dysfunction of regulatory T-cells and the subsequent autoimmunity. [...] The disorder manifests with autoimmune enteropathy, psoriasiform or <b>eczematous</b> dermatitis, nail dystrophy, autoimmune endocrinopathies , and autoimmune skin conditions such as alopecia universalis and bullous pemphigoid.Management for immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked syndrome has seen limited success in treating the syndrome by bone marrow transplantation.|$|E

50|$|When the {{tropical}} rat mite bites its host, it causes an inflammatory reaction to its saliva and then pruritic nonspecific dermatitis. In children especially, vesicular or <b>eczematous</b> reactions sometimes occur. Secondary excoriations due to scratching are common. Papular urticaria has been suggested as developing in some people. No human disease has been definitively found to be naturally vectored by this mite. Lab demonstrations have proved that the mite is at least capable of vectoring murine typhus, rickettsialpox, tularemia, plague, coxsackievirus, and Q fever, although {{it has not been}} known to do so outside the lab. The mite was reported as capable of vectoring human typhus, but these reports are not generally accepted.|$|E
50|$|While typical {{surgical}} {{methods of}} handling VP shunt infections involve removal and reimplantation of the shunt, {{different types of}} operations have used with success in select patients. Steinbok et al. treated a case of recurrent VP shunt infections in an <b>eczematous</b> patient with a ventriculosubgaleal shunt for two months till the eczema healed completely. This type of shunt allowed them to avoid the area of diseased skin that acted {{as the source of}} infection.Jones et al. have treated 4 patients with non-communicating hydrocephalus that suffered VP shunt infections with shunt removal and third ventriculostomy. These patients were cured of the infection and have not required shunt re-insertion, thus showing the effectiveness of this procedure in these types of patients.|$|E

40|$|Recently we {{have shown}} that T-cell-mediated {{keratinocyte}} apoptosis plays a key pathogenetic role {{in the formation of}} <b>eczematous</b> dermatitis. Spongiosis, the histologic hallmark of <b>eczematous</b> dermatitis, is characterized by impairment of cohesion between epidermal keratinocytes. It is conceivable that the intercellular junction of keratinocytes is an early target of apoptosis-inducing T cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the induction of keratinocyte apoptosis is accompanied by a rapid cleavage of E-cadherin and loss of coimmunoprecipitated β-catenin. In situ examination of E-cadherin expression and cellular distribution in acute <b>eczematous</b> dermatitis revealed a reduction in keratinocyte membrane E-cadherin in areas of spongiosis. In contrast, the in vitro and in vivo expression of desmosomal cadherins during early apoptosis remained unchanged. Therefore, induction of keratinocyte apoptosis by skin-infiltrating T cells, subseqent cleavage of E-cadherin, and resisting desmosomal cadherins suggests a mechanism for spongiosis formation in <b>eczematous</b> dermatitis...|$|E
