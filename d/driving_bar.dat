40|$|AbstractThe {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} regulation of genes encoding transcription factors {{is essential for the}} proper development of multicellular organisms. In Drosophila leg development, the distal-most tarsus (ta 5) is specified by the strong expression of a pair of Bar homeobox genes in late third instar. This expression is regulated {{under the control of the}} ta 5 enhancer activated by Bar. No activation of the ta 5 enhancer, however, occurs in early third instar when considerable Bar is produced. The ta 5 enhancer was comprised of a basal enhancer required for <b>driving</b> <b>Bar</b> expression and a negative regulatory motif serving as a binding site for the heterodimer of Spineless and Tango, homologs of the mammalian dioxin receptor and aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator, respectively. The spineless and tango were essential for suppressing the basal enhancer activation in early third instar. The spineless was transiently expressed in early third instar in the Bar expression domain. ta 5 Bar expression may thus be temporally regulated through transient inhibition of premature activation of the basal enhancer via specific binding of the Spineless/Tango heterodimer to the negative regulatory motif in early third instar and subsequent release from the inhibition due to the disappearance of spineless expression at later stages...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Fire {{water monitor}} {{is one of}} the most {{commonly}} used equipments in fire fighting. A liquamatic fire water monitor with self-swinging device was designed. The mechanism of an impeller <b>driving</b> four <b>bar</b> linkage was applied as the self-swinging device. The working principle of the liquamatic fire water monitor was introduced. The internal flow performance was simulated using Fluent software; and the influence rules on jet characteristics were analyzed by changing the cross-sectional shape and diameters of the monitor body, inlet pressure and drive set of the self-swinging device. These analyses led to the optimal structural parameters of flow channel. These simulation results will provide useful theoretical guidance for design of other types of fire water monitor...|$|R
50|$|The SEiGHT (pronounced {{variously}} as S-8 or 'Sayt') is {{a sports}} car manufactured as a kit or factory built vehicle by Westfield Sportscars. It {{is based on the}} familiar Lotus Seven concept, created by Colin Chapman, whose design philosophy was to strip a car design down to bare essentials for the ultimate in <b>driving</b> experiences. <b>Bar</b> a few visual differences, such as a bonnet bulge to house the large engine, it uses the same widebody chassis as the smaller engined SEi. All SEiGHTs are defined as such by the powerplant - a V8 engine. In kit form they are only available from the factory as a rolling chassis, unlike other Westfield kits which can be bought in component form.|$|R
50|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before qualifying - two 60-minute sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. All of the teams, {{with the exception}} of Ferrari, Williams, McLaren, and Renault, were permitted to run three drivers on Friday. Rubens Barrichello topped the timesheets in practices one, two, and three, with times of 1:11.354, 1:10.365, and 1:10.911 respectively. Jenson Button, <b>driving</b> for <b>BAR,</b> however, prevented Barrichello from a clean sweep in the second Saturday session: his time of 1:10.056 was 0.143 quicker than second-placed Michael Schumacher. Third was Takuma Sato, Button's team mate, whilst Barrichello languished in fourth. However, despite the pace of the Ferraris, their Bridgestone tyres had grained in the long runs, meaning that balls of rubber would form {{on the surface of the}} tyre, reducing mechanical grip.|$|R

5000|$|Volvo Cars: Driver Alert Control In 2007, Volvo Cars {{launched}} the world's first Driver Drowsiness Detection system, Driver Alert Control. The system monitors the car's movements and assesses whether {{the vehicle is}} being driven in a controlled or uncontrolled way. If the system detects {{a high risk of}} the driver being drowsy, the driver is alerted via an audible signal. Also, a text message appears in the car's information display, alerting him or her with a coffee cup symbol to take a break. Additionally, the driver can continuously retrieve driving information from the car's trip computer. The starting-point is five bars. The less consistent the <b>driving,</b> the fewer <b>bars</b> remain.|$|R

40|$|Bars in {{galaxies are}} mainly {{supported}} by particles trapped around stable periodic orbits. These orbits represent oscillatory motion {{with only one}} frequency, which is the <b>bar</b> <b>driving</b> frequency, and miss free oscillations. We show that a similar situation takes place in double bars: particles get trapped around parent orbits, {{which in this case}} represent oscillatory motion with two frequencies of driving by the two bars, and which also lack free oscillations. Thus the parent orbits, which constitute the backbone of an oscillating potential of two independently rotating bars, are the double-frequency orbits. These orbits do not close in any reference frame, but they map onto loops, first introduced by Maciejewski & Sparke (1997). Trajectories trapped around the parent double-frequency orbit map onto a set of points confined within a ring surrounding the loop. Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRA...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{spray drift}} {{and its effects}} have become an {{important}} aspect of risk assessment in the registration process of pesticides in Belgium. In this regulation, drift reducing spray application techniques can be used to reduce buffer zones. The purpose of this research is to measure and compare the amount of drift sediment for different spray application techniques under field conditions. A drift prediction equation for the reference spraying was used to compare other spraying techniques with the reference spraying, under different weather conditions. Drift measurements were performed for several combinations of nozzle type (flat fan, low-drift, air injection) and size (ISO 02, 03, 04 and 06), spray pressure (2, 3 and 4 <b>bar),</b> <b>driving</b> speed (4, 6, 8 and 10 km. h- 1) and spray boom height (0. 3, 0. 5 and 0. 75 m). Nozzle type as well as spray pressure, driving speed and spray boom height, have an important effect on the amount of spray drift. Larger nozzle sizes, lower spray pressures and driving speeds and lower spray boom heights generally reduce spray drift. Concerning nozzle types, air injection nozzles have the highest drift reduction potential followed by the low-drift nozzles and the standard flat fan nozzles...|$|R
5|$|By {{reading the}} book, Gray learns that Léone {{is a victim}} of a Vampyr. Vampyrs can force humans into submission. The village doctor visits Léone at the manor, and Gray recognizes him as the old man he saw in the castle. The doctor tells Gray that a blood {{transfusion}} is needed and Gray offers his blood to save Léone. Exhausted from blood loss, Gray sleeps. He wakes sensing danger and rushes to Léone, where he surprises the doctor as he is attempting to poison the girl. The doctor flees the manor, and Gray finds that Gisèle is gone. Gray follows the doctor back to the castle, where Gray has a vision of himself being buried alive. After the vision subsides, he rescues Gisèle but the doctor escapes. The old servant of the manor finds Gray's Vampyr book and discovers that a Vampyr can be defeated by <b>driving</b> an iron <b>bar</b> through its heart. The servant meets Gray at Marguerite Chopin's grave behind the village Chapel. They open the grave and find the old woman perfectly preserved. They hammer a large metal bar through her heart, killing her. The village doctor is hiding in an old mill, but finds himself locked in a chamber where flour sacks are filled. The old servant arrives and activates the mill's machinery, filling the chamber with flour and suffocating the doctor. The curse of the Vampyr is lifted and Léone suddenly recovers. Gisèle and Gray cross a foggy river by boat and find themselves in a bright clearing.|$|R
40|$|Spray drift can {{be defined}} as the {{quantity}} of plant protection product that is carried out of the sprayed area by the action of air currents during the application process. This continues to be a major problem in applying agricultural pesticides. The purpose of this research is to measure the amount of sedimenting drift from a horizontal boom sprayer for different (drift reducing) spray application techniques under field conditions and to compare the results with the results from a reference spray, taking into account variations in meteorological conditions during the field drift experiments. Field drift measurements were performed for several combinations of nozzle type (standard flat-fan, low-drift, air inclusion) and size (ISO 02, 03, 04, and 06), spray pressure (2. 0, 3. 0, and 4. 0 <b>bar),</b> <b>driving</b> speed (4, 6, 8, and 10 km h(- 1)), and spray boom height (0. 3, 0. 5, and 0. 75 m) according to ISO 22866 by sampling in a defined downwind area at 24 different positions using horizontal drift collectors. The reference spray was defined as a standard horizontal spray boom without air support, a spray boom height of 0. 50 m, a nozzle distance of 0. 50 m, ISO 110 03 standard flat-fan nozzles at 3. 0 bar (1. 2 L min(- 1)), and a driving speed of 8 km h(- 1), resulting in an application rate of approximately 180 L ha(- 1). Nozzle type as well as spray pressure, driving speed, and spray boom height, have an important effect on the amount of spray drift. Larger nozzle sizes, lower spray pressures and driving speeds, and lower spray boom heights generally reduce spray drift. Concerning nozzle types, air inclusion nozzles have the highest drift reduction potential, followed by the low-drift nozzles and the standard flat-fan nozzles. Drift results are closely linked with droplet size characteristics of the sprays...|$|R
