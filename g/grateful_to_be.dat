I shall be glad and {{grateful}} if I can spend some few years of peace and repose in France and Paris, and still more <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> enabled to repay the hospitality accorded to me, by making available those abundant stores of knowledge acquired throughout my career.|$|E
25|$|Frederick died in 1771, {{by which}} time {{relations}} between Britain and her American colonies were fast deteriorating. In his will, Frederick left his proprietary Palatinate of Maryland to his eldest illegitimate son, Henry Harford, then aged just 13. The colony, perhaps <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rid of Frederick at last, recognized Harford as Calvert's heir. However, the will was challenged by the family of Frederick's sister, Louisa Calvert Browning, who did not recognize Harford's inheritance. Before the case could grind {{its way through the}} Court of Chancery, Maryland had become engulfed by the American Revolution and by 1776 was at war with Britain. Henry Harford would ultimately lose almost all his colonial possessions.|$|E
25|$|Xu Shu {{was from}} Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡), Yu Province, {{which is in}} present-day central Henan. His {{original}} family name was Shan (單) and his original given name was Fu (福). He was a swordsman in his early life and he once helped someone take revenge by killing another person. To avoid being recognised, he covered his face with white chalk and let his hair run wild. He was later arrested by an official, who asked him for his name, {{but he did not}} reply. The official tied him to a cart, paraded him through the streets, and asked for any person who could identify him. No one came forth. Xu Shu's fellows rescued him later. He was so <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> saved that he gave up his life as a swordsman and became a scholar.|$|E

500|$|Chris Carter (Destructoid) {{wrote that}} the game was an {{unexpected}} favorite in his Rare Replay review. Philip Kollar (Polygon) was also [...] "surprised" [...] by the game, which he found incredibly fun. Kollar ranked the game near {{the middle of the}} Rare Replay collection. Timothy Seppala (Engadget) was <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> introduced to Battletoads Arcade on Rare Replay. He considered the game among Rare's [...] "finest moments" [...] and one of two retro titles worth playing. Sam Machkovech (Ars Technica) described the game as one of the rarest in the compilation.|$|E
500|$|Banks {{signed with}} the Chicago Cubs in late 1953, making his major league debut on September 17 at age 22 and playing in 10 games at Wrigley Field. He was the Cubs' first black player; {{he became one of}} several former Negro league players who joined MLB teams without playing in the minor leagues. Larry Moffi and Jonathan Kronstadt wrote that he [...] "just was not the crusading type. He was so <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> playing {{baseball}} for a living, he did not have time to change the world, and if that meant some people called him an Uncle Tom, well, so be it." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{second letter}} {{was sent to}} several {{corporations}} seeking donations for a vehicle, running shoes and to cover the other costs of the run. Fox sent other letters asking for grants to buy a running leg. He observed {{that while he was}} <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alive following his cancer treatment, [...] "I remember promising myself that, should I live, I would rise up to meet this new challenge [...] face to face and prove myself worthy of life, something too many people take for granted." [...] The Ford Motor Company donated a camper van, while Imperial Oil contributed fuel, and Adidas his running shoes. Fox turned away any company that requested he endorse their products and refused any donation that carried conditions, as he insisted that nobody was to profit from his run.|$|E
500|$|As a captain, Willis has {{subsequently}} received mixed assessment. Botham retained {{fond memories}} of Willis the player, but remarked that Willis {{found it difficult to}} captain him because the men were of similar age. Willis, often noted for his enthusiasm, became an [...] "effective motivator" [...] as a captain; however, he was [...] "no outstanding tactical genius" [...] and [...] "towards the end his feelings bordered on disgust at the conviction that some of England's cricketers accepted failure too readily. Nor was he able to close himself off against media comment." [...] He was also characterised as a loner in the game, and a reluctant captain <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> placed back within the ranks after repeated defeats while he was at the reins. His 18 Tests as England captain saw 7 victories, 5 defeats, and 6 draws, while he led England in 29 ODI matches, winning 16 and losing 13.|$|E
500|$|Jackie Debatin, who {{appeared}} in [...] "Ben Franklin" [...] as Elizabeth, is used to playing strippers and hookers. Debatin had previously been a stripper on Friends, a stripper on That '70s Show, a stripper on Two and a Half Men, a madam on Veronica Mars, and a call girl on Boston Legal. In an interview, Debatin said playing Elizabeth was [...] "probably the best experience I have had in TV work", because {{the cast and crew}} were [...] "down to earth, fun, <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there". Although actor Andrew Daly, who played Gordon the Ben Franklin impersonator, had already known John Krasinski, Angela Kinsey, B. J. Novak and Kate Flannery, he said that The Office cast and crew [...] "could not have been more welcoming to me." [...] Daly especially liked it when the actors [...] "depart from the script and improvised a little." ...|$|E

2500|$|In July 2017, Benedict XVI sent {{a message}} through his private {{secretary}} Monsignor Gänswein for {{the occasion of the}} funeral of Cardinal Joachim Meisner, who had suddenly passed away while on vacation in Germany. In his message, the Pope Emeritus referred to Meisner as a [...] "passionate shepherd and pastor" [...] who found it [...] "difficult to leave his post". The former pope also said that he had spoken on the telephone with Meisner the day before the latter died and related that Meisner was <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on vacation after having been present for the beatification of Teofilius Matulionis in Vilnius.|$|E
2500|$|Egan's {{final week}} of auditions, {{during which she}} sang for Menken for the first time, was {{particularly}} challenging. On her last day of auditioning, Egan auditioned opposite several different actors trying out for {{the roles of the}} Beast and Gaston. As the day concluded, Roth directed Egan to approach the role as [...] "a straight ingénue", and she was ultimately cast upon proving capable of playing Belle both straight and comically. Only afterward did Egan celebrate by finally renting and watching the entire film for the first time. Although Egan did not feel particularly pressured about the role, she was <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> surrounded by a supporting cast of veteran Broadway performers.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Simon {{received}} {{the first annual}} Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. Named in honor of George and Ira Gershwin, this new award recognizes the profound and positive effect of popular music on the world's culture. On being notified of the honor, Simon said, [...] "I am <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the recipient of the}} Gershwin Prize and doubly honored to be the first. I look forward to spending an evening in the company of artists I admire at the award ceremony in May. I can think of a few who have expressed my words and music far better than I. I'm excited at the prospect of that happening again. It's a songwriter's dream come true." [...] Among the performers who paid tribute to Simon were Stevie Wonder, Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Lyle Lovett, James Taylor, Dianne Reeves, Marc Anthony, Yolanda Adams, and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The event was professionally filmed and broadcast and is now available as Paul Simon and Friends.|$|E

2500|$|The couple {{appeared}} to have a happy marriage and had two daughters together, presenting a united outward appearance during the late 1980s. His wife's personal qualities were seen as refreshing {{in the context of}} the formal protocol surrounding the Royal Family. However, the Duke of York's frequent travel due to his military career, as well as relentless, often critical, media attention focused on the Duchess of York, led to fractures in the marriage. On 19 March 1992, the couple announced plans to separate and did so in an amicable way. Some months later, pictures appeared in the tabloid media of the Duchess in intimate association with John Bryan, her financial advisor at the time, which effectively ended any hopes of a reconciliation between the Duke and Duchess. The marriage was ended in divorce on 30 May 1996. The Duke of York spoke fondly of his former wife: [...] "We have managed to work together to bring our children up in a way that few others have been able to and I am extremely <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to do that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shevchenko {{was arrested}} {{along with other}} members of the society on April 5, 1847. Tsar Nicholas read Shevchenko's poem, [...] "Dream". Vissarion Belinsky wrote in his memoirs that, Nicholas I, knowing Ukrainian very well, laughed and chuckled whilst reading the section about himself, but his mood quickly turned to bitter hatred when he read about his wife. Shevchenko had mocked her frumpy {{appearance}} and facial tics, which she had developed fearing the Decembrist Uprising and its plans to kill her family. After reading this section the Tsar indignantly stated [...] "I suppose he had reasons not to be on terms with me, but what has she done to deserve this?" [...] In the official report of Orlov Shevchenko was accused in using [...] "Little-Russian language" [...] (archaic Russian name for Ukrainian language) of outrageous content instead of being <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> redeemed out of serfdom. In the report Orlov claimed that Shevchenko was expressing a cry over alleged enslavement and disaster of Ukraine, glorified the Hetman Administration (Cossack Hetmanate) and Cossack liberties and [...] "with incredible audacity poured slander and bile on persons of Imperial House".|$|E
2500|$|A {{conservative}} {{contributor to}} Ain't it Cool News said the film featured [...] "ingenious comedy that we remember from Airplane!" [...] and was [...] "funny and inventive." [...] Kathleen Parker of Washington Post Writers Group described {{the film as}} [...] " [...] The Best Movie You Ever Saw, but it’s something. It’s radical in its assault on the left wing; it’s brave given the risk of peer ridicule {{and the potential for}} career suicide. And it’s funny — if you like that sort of thing. Generally, I don’t." [...] Michael Brendan Doherty of The American Conservative considered the movie to be funny [...] "in parts", but concluded that [...] "Far from lampooning the Left, “Carol” insults conservatives by presuming that they are so simple as to be won over by fat jokes and flatulence. But the audience, imagining itself to be persecuted by Hollywood, is so <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> flattered by Zucker and company that they chuckle obediently at every cheap laff." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the movie one star out of five, called it [...] "jaw-droppingly awful," [...] and [...] "about as not-funny as a comedy can get." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post wrote, [...] "Even if it weren't three years too late to parody Moore (ineptly played by Kevin Farley), Moore's ridiculous tribute to Cuban health care in Sicko is far funnier than anything in this desperately laughless farce from David Zucker." ...|$|E
