5|$|On February 10 Matsui {{received}} a messenger from the Army General Staff who informed him, much to Matsui's chagrin and disappointment, that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> be relieved {{of command and}} replaced with Shunroku Hata. Ultimately, the Army General Staff did not punish Matsui but they did shake up the whole field command in China and Matsui {{was just one of}} eighty senior officers, including Asaka and Yanagawa, who were all recalled at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{was still}} {{attached}} to her old friend when Mary Dudley left the court in July 1579because of bad health, or out of solidarity with her brother Robert, Earl of Leicester, who was in disgrace for having married. She joined her husband at Ludlow in 1582, where he was serving his third turn as President of the Council of Wales. A year later her health {{was in such a}} state that Henry Sidney believed <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> have the opportunity to take a second wife. Mary Dudley died on 9August 1586, three months after her husband, in whose elaborate funeral she had participated. She was buried by his side at Penshurst.|$|E

5|$|Feeling {{restricted}} by his experiences as an R sideman, Hendrix moved in 1966 to New York City's Greenwich Village, {{which had a}} vibrant and diverse music scene. There, he was offered a residency at the Cafe Wha? on MacDougal Street and formed his own band that June, Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, which included future Spirit guitarist Randy California. The Blue Flames played at several clubs in New York and Hendrix began developing his guitar style and material that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> use with the Experience. In September, they gave some of their last concerts at the Cafe au Go Go, as John Hammond Jr.'s backing group.|$|E
5|$|Gallagher {{was born}} in New Brunswick in 1854, {{the son of an}} Irish {{immigrant}} father. After attending the schools of his birthplace, he moved west to Winnipeg with his family, and became involved in the family meat packing business, established by his father. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> move west again to what would later become the province of Saskatchewan, where he would continue his business, providing his product to the local police establishments and soldiers during the North-West Rebellion. After his contracts expired there, Gallagher would move again further west, to Edmonton, where he would permanently settle.|$|E
5|$|At the July 1945 general {{election}} Dunglass lost his Parliamentary {{seat in the}} landslide Labour victory. It was widely assumed that as his father, the 13th earl, was in his seventies, Dunglass's political career was behind him, as <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> inherit the earldom. There being at that time no provision for peers to disclaim their peerages, this would bring with it an obligatory seat in the House of Lords, with no option of remaining in the Commons, where most political power resided. Dunglass was appointed {{a director of the}} Bank of Scotland in 1946, and although he never considered banking as a long-term occupation he gained valuable first-hand experience in commerce and finance. He remained with the bank until 1951.|$|E

5|$|Cooper {{earned a}} Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale in 1923 and {{enrolled}} at Harvard Law School later that year. During the summer break of 1924, {{he returned to}} Kentucky, where his father, dying of Bright's disease, told him that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> become {{the head of the}} family, and that most of the family's resources had been lost in the economic recession of the early 1920s. Cooper returned to Harvard after his father's death, but soon discovered that he could not simultaneously pursue a law degree and manage his family's affairs. He was admitted to the bar by examination in 1928 and opened a legal practice in Somerset. Over the next 20 years, he sold his father's remaining assets, paid off the family debts, and financed a college education for his six siblings.|$|E
5|$|Freyr arrives {{home and}} neither sleeps nor drinks, {{remaining}} in silence. No one dares speak to him. The god Njörðr sends Freyr's servant Skírnir {{to speak to}} Freyr. Freyr tells Skírnir that he saw a beautiful woman, so beautiful that he was filled with grief and that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> die {{if he could not}} have her. Freyr tells Skírnir that he must go gain her hand on his behalf—whether the woman's father agrees or not—and he will be rewarded. Skírnir replies that he accepts the mission but only in exchange for Freyr's sword, which can fight on its own. Freyr gives him the sword and Skírnir sets off. Skírnir asks for the woman's hand for Freyr and receives her promise. Nine nights later she is to meet with Freyr at a location called Barey. Skírnir delivers the news to Freyr and Freyr responds with the final stanza from the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál, lamenting that he must wait.|$|E
5|$|Tillman spoke {{widely in}} the state in 1885 and after, and soon {{attracted}} allies, including a number of Red Shirt comrades, such as Martin Gary's nephews Eugene B. Gary and John Gary Evans. He sought to mold local farmers' groups into a statewide organization to be a voice for agriculturalists. In April 1886, a convention called by Tillman met in Columbia, the state capital. The goal of {{what became known as the}} Farmer's Association or Farmer's Movement was to control the state Democratic Party from within, and to gain reforms such as the agricultural college. He initially was unsuccessful, though he came within thirty votes of controlling the 1886 state Democratic convention. The lack of success caused Tillman, in late 1887, to announce his retirement from politics, though there was widespread speculation <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> be back.|$|E

60|$|Hare, {{watching}} this scene, became conscious that his fear had intensified with {{the recognition of}} Two-Spot as Chance, the outlaw whom <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>soon</b> forget. In his excitement he moved against Mescal and felt her trembling violently.|$|R
5|$|By 22:00, the Rangers and ex-POWs {{arrived at}} Plateros, where they rested {{for half an}} hour. A radio message was sent and {{received}} by Sixth Army at 23:00 that the mission had been a success, {{and that they were}} returning with the rescued prisoners to American lines. After a headcount, it was discovered that POW Edwin Rose, a deaf British soldier, was missing. Mucci dictated that none of the Rangers could be spared to search for him, so he sent several guerrillas {{to do so in the}} morning. It was later learned that Rose had fallen asleep in the latrine before the attack. Rose woke early the next morning, and realized the other prisoners were gone and that he was left behind. Nevertheless, he took the time to shave and put on his best clothes that he had been saving for the day he would be rescued. He walked out of the prison camp, thinking that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> be found and led to freedom. Sure enough, Rose was found by passing guerrillas. Arrangements were made for a tank destroyer unit to pick him up and transport him to a hospital.|$|E
5|$|His {{campaign}} against Ferghana {{was under way}} when news reached the army of Caliph Walid's death and the accession of his brother Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik to the throne. The new Caliph was a bitter enemy of Qutayba, for the latter had argued in favour of excluding him from the succession. Although Sulayman re-confirmed him in his position as governor, Qutayba feared that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> be removed. At the last, after negotiations with the new regime in Damascus failed, Qutayba resolved to rebel. The Khurasani Arabs refused to support him, and the native auxiliaries, although favourably disposed towards him, were prevented from declaring their support by Hayyan al-Nabati. Only his family, his fellow Bahili tribesmen and his bodyguard, the Archers, remained faithful. The opposition, led by the Tamim tribe, coalesced around their leader Waki ibn Abi Sud al-Tamimi. In August 715 (according to al-Tabari) or early 716 (according to Ibn Qutaybah), Qutayba {{and other members of}} his family were killed at Ferghana by Arab soldiers. Waki ibn Abi Sud succeeded him as governor, and ordered the army to return to Merv, where it was disbanded.|$|E

60|$|It was {{characteristic}} of Jimmy {{that it never}} even occurred to him to desert the fallen one, and depart alone. Spike was his brother-in-arms. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> as <b>soon</b> have thought of deserting him as a sea-captain would of abandoning the ship.|$|R
50|$|Jennings {{posted a}} status on his {{official}} Facebook page during February 2014, stating <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be <b>soon</b> be collaborating with Billy Ray Cyrus on a future BCR release. Also in 2014, Jennings played his first gigs with Waylor's Outlaws, his father's band.|$|R

60|$|Partly {{in his old}} {{habit of}} submission, partly because his not doing it might injure his benefactor, and partly because <b>he</b> <b>would</b> as <b>soon</b> do it as {{anything}} else, Cavalletto took up the Refrain this time. Rigaud laughed, and fell to smoking with his eyes shut.|$|R
50|$|LaDanian Tomlinson had a game <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>soon</b> forget. <b>He</b> passed Jim Brown, who {{happened}} to be sitting up in a suite.

25|$|Cole swapped {{back to the}} Cadillac {{power for}} the start of 1952, taking second place in the Vero Beach 12 Hour Endurance Road Race.

25|$|Sun Quan (aged 18) succeeded him {{and quickly}} {{established}} his authority. By 203, he was expanding westward.
