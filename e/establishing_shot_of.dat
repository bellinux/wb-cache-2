Initially they had been considering the Zhangjiajie Mountains in China, but because the landscape base plates were being shot in Ireland, using Meteora was a better option.|$|E

25|$|The {{filming of}} the third season began in early July 2012, and {{concluded}} with the wrap of the unit filming in Iceland on November 24, 2012. Filming in Iceland, for scenes {{in five of the}} season's ten episodes, took place near Akureyri and Lake Mývatn. Dimmuborgir was used as the location for Mance Rayder's wildling army camp, and the Grjótagjá cave was used as <b>establishing</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Jon Snow and Ygrite in the cave although most of this scene was filmed in the studio. The filming in Iceland lasted eight days, as opposed to nearly a month for season 2. Kit Harington (Jon Snow) broke an ankle in an accident in July, which required the Iceland shoots to be pushed back to give him time to heal, as well as the occasional use of a body double.|$|E

500|$|Matte {{paintings}} of the Austrian castle and German airport were based on real buildings; the Austrian castle was a small West German castle that was made to look larger. Rain was created by filming granulated Borax soap against black at high speed. It was only lightly double exposed into the shots so it would not resemble snow. The lightning was animated. The airport used was at San Francisco's Treasure Island, which already had appropriate art deco architecture. ILM added a control tower, Nazi banners, vintage automobiles and a sign stating [...] "Berlin Flughafen". The <b>establishing</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the Hatayan city at dusk was created by filming silhouetted cutouts that were backlit and obscured by smoke. Matte paintings {{were used for the}} sky and to give the appearance of fill light in the shadows and rim light on the edges of the buildings.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{film and}} {{television}} productions have included scenes shot at Grand Central Terminal.

50|$|Many {{broadcast}} shows use stock-footage clips as <b>establishing</b> <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> {{a particular}} city, which {{imply that the}} show is shot on location when in fact, it may be shot in a backlot studio. One or two <b>establishing</b> <b>shots</b> <b>of</b> an exotic location such as the Great Wall of China, Easter Island, or French Polynesia will save production companies the major costs of transporting crew and equipment to those actual locations.|$|R

From the second season onward, stock shots of the 32-story Los Angeles City Hall were used as the Planet building and the sidewalk entrance to the Planet was a studio-bound [...] "exterior." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jay Ellis elaborates on Chigurh's {{encounter}} with {{the man behind the}} counter at the gas station. [...] "Where McCarthy gives us Chigurh's question as, 'What's the most you ever saw lost on a coin toss?', he says, 'the film elides the word 'saw', but the Coens of course tend to the visual. Where the book describes the setting as 'almost dark', the film clearly depicts high noon: no shadows are notable in the <b>establishing</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the gas station, and the sunlight is bright even if behind cloud cover. The light through two windows and a door comes evenly through three walls in the interior shots. But this difference increases our sense of the man's desperation later, when he claims he needs to close and he closes at 'near dark'; it is darker, as it were, in the cave of this man's ignorance than it is outside in the bright light of truth." ...|$|E
