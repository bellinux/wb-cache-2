Two full-sized beam-to-column tests have been conducted to determine the moment-rotation response of novel connection detailing for braced frames. Members were of 203 x 203 x 9. 53 mm wide <b>flange</b> <b>profile</b> with minor axis orientation. To construct the internal joints two 9. 53 mm flat sheets of outer dimensions 600 mm by 600 mm were bonded to the flat surfaces formed by the flanges of the two beam sections and the central continuous column. Vertical loading was applied to the cantilever beams, at a distance of 1. 2 m from the column's centreline, until a bonded connection failed catastrophically. The moment-resistant properties of the all-bonded joints were obtained and used to assess their suitability in practice...|$|E

Regarding the fact that IPB (HE-B) wide flange profiles are largely used for production of the main carriers of monorail transport systems, this paper presents the results of the action of the local stress caused by the effect of cart wheels on the HE-A <b>flange</b> <b>profile,</b> using the methods and procedures of relevant researchers, the procedures prescribed by the standard EN 15011 as well as the results of calculations using finite element method. It has been revealed, based on comparative analysis of the results, that in the transition zone low flange / rib longitudinal local stress on the lower contour flange, determined using the above mentioned standards have tightening characteristic, while all other methods, including finite element method, give the pressing nature of the considered voltage. In addition, all of these procedures, except for the finite element method, adopt the assumption that absolute value of voltage, caused by local bending on upper and lower contour of the loaded flange, are the same, and there is no physical justification. Bearing in mind the fact that stress identification, caused by the flange local bending, is an extremely important phase proving the strength of monorail beams, we may conclude that the application of standard EN 15011 does not provide reliable results when it comes to wide flange profiles...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} a study including testing, analysis and design on beam-to column connections for the frames of pultruded glass {{fibre reinforced plastic}} profiles. The research consists of the two principal aspects of a laboratory test programme to determine connection behaviour and the formulation of a plane frame analytical tool to determine the effect of real connection on frame behaviour. The laboratory tests involved three different 10 inch beam-to-column connections which can be categorised as having a moment-rotation behaviour that is pinned. These connections had web cleats and the method of connection was by bolting, or bolting combined with adhesive bonding. The test configuration had a central column and two beams in a cruciform arrangement. Loading was applied at the ends of the cantilever beams {{in such a way that}} the two identical connections experienced the same moment and shear force. The non-linear moment-rotation characteristics for the connections were determined and the modes of failure established. Another four tests were conducted on different 8 inch beam-to-column connections which can be categorised as being semi-rigid. Two of these connections used steel cleats for the top and bottom seat cleats while the other two had these pieces manufactured of pre-preg glass FRP using a pressure moulding process. The details and the results of these connection tests are presented. The results of the three tests on pinned connections confirmed conclusions previously reported on similar tests where the beams and column were of the 8 inch wide <b>flange</b> <b>profile.</b> The current practice of recommending that the cleated webs have combined bonding and bolting is shown to provide little additional benefit over that when the connection is bolted. It is found that a semi-rigid connection with an acceptable moment-rotation behaviour can be obtained using steel angles for the connection pieces. One of the two 'all' FRP connections was also found to have an acceptable moment-rotation characteristic but would be too complicated for real applications. The search therefore continues for the all FRP connection details giving suitable connection behaviour. Combining the results from these experiments and the analysis of the failure modes, a number of futuristic connection designs are proposed. They include a thin shell cleat piece with curvature to increase its stiffness, six connection details using pieces that connect together by interlock and bonding (this approach reduces the need for bolting) and a radically novel system which does not mimic current steelwork practice. A new analytical method is presented which predicts the static response of nonlinear elastic plane frames of polymeric composite members. Options allow for horizontal and vertical loading, second-order deflections and connections with nonlinear moment-rotation characteristics. The matrix stiffness method uses a new approach to cope with the real connection behaviour. The other novel aspects of the analysis are shear deformable members and new stability functions which account for the shear deformation when determining second-order deflections. A number of new (<p) functions are derived to group the new stability functions, and these can readily be employed in the computing analysis. The analysis is successfully benchmarked against known semi-rigid frame problems of steelwork and with the limited results from a single experiment on a pultruded single bay frame. A serviceability beam line is presented for beam design and a moment equalized connection stiffness is obtained. Two unbraced and one braced frame problems are analysed in a parametric study to determine the effect on frame response of having connections with various properties. Live loading is vertical with a horizontal component. Results of overall sway deflection showed how the frames respond when the connection properties are changed from pinned, through semi-rigid, to fully fixed. The sensitivity of the connection stiffness on the overall frame behaviour is demonstrated by the sway and the midspan deflections results, and by the moment distribution in the members. The analysis is shown to provide useful information in our quest for the optimised connection design and their performance when viewed as an integral part of a whole frame. To establish which connection details are best suited to pultruded frame construction recommendations for further research and development work are given...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{testing and}} {{theoretical}} methods {{to determine the}} critical local flange buckling load in concentric pultruded columns are presented. Knowledge of this critical load for wide <b>flange</b> <b>profiles</b> is required in a new universal column design procedure. Because there are too few test results for other profile sizes only the standard 203 x 203 x 9. 53 mm (8 x 8 x 3 / 8 in.) profile is considered. Reasons are given {{to explain why the}} 14 data points give buckling loads between 307 and 406 kN. To obtain a test result corresponding to the true physical situation the minimum column length should be four half-wavelengths of the local instability. The true critical load is about 360 kN. Presented are nine closed form equations {{that can be used to}} predict the critical load for the local instability. To use these equations effectively, it is shown that the elastic constants of the flange material must be those of the profile being analysed. Numerical methods, and their closed form equations, that include the rotational stiffness at the web-flange connection are shown to be reasonably accurate. However, without direct access to the software they are difficult to apply, and these equations are therefore unsuitable for application in the preparation of universal design guidance. A simpler equation that predicts the buckling load to within 4 % of 360 kN is therefore recommended. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Typical {{load-bearing}} LSF {{walls are}} made of conventional lipped channel section studs and gypsum plasterboards. Current research at the QUT is investigating the effects of using new thin-walled stud sections on the fire resistant rating of LSF walls, in particular the use of Hollow Flange Channel (HFC) sections. A sound knowledge on the thermal performance of these LSF walls is essential, but expensive and time consuming nature of fire tests has acted as a barrier. In this study finite element models were developed to predict the thermal performance of load bearing LSF walls made of HFC section studs exposed to fire on one side. The developed models were validated using the results of five full scale standard fire tests of LSF walls. They were then extended to perform a parametric study where the effects of stud dimensions, geometries, spacings and wall configuration were evaluated.

40|$|Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) {{walls are}} {{commonly}} used in building construction. In general, they are lined with single or double layers of gypsum plasterboards with and without cavity insulation. Gypsum plasterboards act as a thermal barrier to protect the thin-walled steel studs from rapid temperature rise. In these walls, plasterboard joints are located along the studs for ease of construction and are protected by filler materials. During fires, these plasterboard joints crack and open up, and thus allow the stud temperatures to rise rapidly and initiate premature structural failures in LSF walls. This research investigated the detrimental effects of these plasterboards joints on the fire resistance rating of single and double plasterboard lined walls based on the hot <b>flange</b> time-temperature <b>profiles</b> of studs from full scale fire tests. To overcome the detrimental effects of plasterboard joints, the back-blocking technique was used, where plasterboard joints were placed between studs with 150 mm wide plasterboards as back-blocks. Full scale fire tests and numerical studies were performed on single plasterboard lined load bearing LSF wall panels to investigate the improved fire performance by using this technique. They showed that the fire resistance rating of these LSF walls was increased by 25 % {{in comparison to the}} conventional plasterboard joint arrangement over the studs. This paper presents the details of this research on the detrimental effects of plasterboard joints on the fire resistance of load bearing LSF walls, and the results.

40|$|AbstractFlexible {{roll forming}} is an {{advanced}} {{sheet metal forming}} process for producing variable cross section <b>profiles.</b> <b>Flange</b> wrinkling at the transition zone where the cross section changes is a major defect in the flexible roll forming process. In this paper, the flange wrinkling at the transition zone is studied using finite element analysis. The {{results showed that the}} strip deformation at the transition zone can be considered as a combination of two strip deformations observed in the conventional roll forming process and the flanging process. According to finite element analysis results, when the flange wrinkling occurs, compressive longitudinal strain is smaller than the necessary compressive longitudinal strain calculated by mathematical modeling to obtain the intended profile geometry in the compression zone. Therefore, comparison of compressive longitudinal strain obtained from the finite element analysis and the necessary compressive longitudinal strain is a good criterion to predict the flange wrinkling occurrence. A flexible roll forming setup was developed. Longitudinal strain history is obtained from the finite element simulation and is compared with the experimental data from the flexible roll forming setup.

The aim of this project was to study the subjective responses to any changes in facial esthetics and lip support/lip projection related to the maxillary prostheses. 20 maxillary edentulous patients esthetically satisfied with their maxillary complete dentures {{were included in the}} study. Each patient’s maxillary denture was duplicated. Frontal and profile digital images were made with the duplicate denture in the mouth. Then, the labial flange was sectioned off from first premolar to first premolar, and the same images were taken. Four images per subject were evaluated in random order twice by 15 General Dentists, 15 Prosthodontists and 30 Laypeople. The judges used VAS to analyze the images.

40|$|Cold {{roll forming}} is a bending process where the bending occurs {{gradually}} in several forming steps from an undeformed strip to a finished profile. The process {{is very interesting}} for the sheet metal industry due to the high speed in which the profile can be produced. High strength steel has, in recent years, become more common in cold roll forming. These materials have advantages but also disadvantages that affect {{the design of the}} process. Simple models in literature [K. F. Chiang, Cold roll forming, ME Thesis, University of Auckland, August 1984] predict that the longitudinal peak membrane strain in the <b>flange</b> of a <b>profile</b> is independent of the material properties. However, Ingvarsson [L. Ingvarsson, Förenklad teori för rullforming av elementär v-profil, jämförelse mellan normalt och höghållfast stål, VAMP 15 - rullforming 23 april 2001] compared mild and ultra high strength in a roll forming experiment and the conclusion was that the material properties will affect the finished profile. This paper is a fundamental study performed {{in order to understand the}} observation by Ingvarsson [L. Ingvarsson, Förenklad teori för rullforming av elementär v-profil, jämförelse mellan normalt och höghållfast stål, VAMP 15 - rullforming 23 april 2001]. The objectives of this study are to investigate the change in the longitudinal peak membrane strain at the flange edge and the deformation length when the yield strength increases. These are important since they can be used to determine the number of forming steps and the distance between them when designing the cold roll forming machine. The result from the simulations show that the longitudinal peak membrane strain decreases and the deformation length increases when the yield strength is increased.

40|$|Cold-formed {{steel stud}} walls {{are a major}} {{component}} of Light Steel Framing (LSF) building systems used in commercial, industrial and residential buildings. In the conventional LSF stud wall systems, thin steel studs are protected from fire by placing one or two layers of plasterboard on both sides with or without cavity insulation. However, there is very limited data about the structural and thermal performance of stud wall systems while past research showed contradicting results, for example, about the benefits of cavity insulation. This research was therefore conducted to improve the knowledge and understanding of the structural and thermal performance of cold-formed steel stud wall systems (both load bearing and non-load bearing) under fire conditions and to develop new improved stud wall systems including reliable and simple methods to predict their fire resistance rating. Full scale fire tests of cold-formed steel stud wall systems formed the basis of this research. This research proposed an innovative LSF stud wall system in which a composite panel made of two plasterboards with insulation between them was used to improve the fire rating. Hence fire tests included both conventional steel stud walls with and without the use of cavity insulation and the new composite panel system. A propane fired gas furnace was specially designed and constructed first. The furnace was designed to deliver heat in accordance with the standard time temperature curve as proposed by AS 1530. 4 (SA, 2005). A compression loading frame capable of loading the individual studs of a full scale steel stud wall system was also designed and built for the load-bearing tests. Fire tests included comprehensive time-temperature measurements across the thickness and along the length of all the specimens using K type thermocouples. They also included the measurements of load-deformation characteristics of stud walls until failure. The first phase of fire tests included 15 small scale fire tests of gypsum plasterboards, and composite panels using different types of insulating material of varying thickness and density. Fire performance of single and multiple layers of gypsum plasterboards was assessed including the effect of interfaces between adjacent plasterboards on the thermal performance. Effects of insulations such as glass fibre, rock fibre and cellulose fibre were also determined while the tests provided important data relating to the temperature at which the fall off of external plasterboards occurred. In the second phase, nine small scale non-load bearing wall specimens were tested to investigate the thermal performance of conventional and innovative steel stud wall systems. Effects of single and multiple layers of plasterboards with and without vertical joints were investigated. The new composite panels were seen to offer greater thermal protection to the studs in comparison to the conventional panels. In the third phase of fire tests, nine full scale load bearing wall specimens were tested to study the thermal and structural performance of the load bearing wall assemblies. A full scale test was also conducted at ambient temperature. These tests showed that the use of cavity insulation led to inferior fire performance of walls, and provided good explanations and supporting research data to overcome the incorrect industry assumptions about cavity insulation. They demonstrated that the use of insulation externally in a composite panel enhanced the thermal and structural performance of stud walls and increased their fire resistance rating significantly. Hence this research recommends the use of the new composite panel system for cold-formed LSF walls. This research also included steady state tensile tests at ambient and elevated temperatures to address the lack of reliable mechanical properties for high grade cold-formed steels at elevated temperatures. Suitable predictive equations were developed for calculating the yield strength and elastic modulus at elevated temperatures. In summary, this research has developed comprehensive experimental thermal and structural performance data for both the conventional and the proposed non-load bearing and load bearing stud wall systems under fire conditions. Idealized hot <b>flange</b> temperature <b>profiles</b> have been developed for non-insulated, cavity insulated and externally insulated load bearing wall models along with suitable equations for predicting their failure times. A graphical method has also been proposed to predict the failure times (fire rating) of non-load bearing and load bearing walls under different load ratios. The results from this research are useful to both fire researchers and engineers working in this field. Most importantly, this research has significantly improved the knowledge and understanding of cold-formed LSF walls under fire conditions, and developed an innovative LSF wall system with increased fire rating. It has clearly demonstrated the detrimental effects of using cavity insulation, and has paved the way for Australian building industries to develop new wall panels with increased fire rating for commercial applications worldwide...|$|R
40|$|In recent times, {{light gauge}} steel framed (LSF) structures, such as cold-formed steel wall systems, are {{increasingly}} used, but without {{a full understanding of}} their fire performance. Traditionally the fire resistance rating of these load-bearing LSF wall systems is based on approximate prescriptive methods developed based on limited fire tests. Very often they are limited to standard wall configurations used by the industry. Increased fire rating is provided simply by adding more plasterboards to these walls. This is not an acceptable situation as it not only inhibits innovation and structural and cost efficiencies but also casts doubt over the fire safety of these wall systems. Hence a detailed fire research study into the performance of LSF wall systems was undertaken using full scale fire tests and extensive numerical studies. A new composite wall panel developed at QUT was also considered in this study, where the insulation was used externally between the plasterboards {{on both sides of the}} steel wall frame instead of locating it in the cavity. Three full scale fire tests of LSF wall systems built using the new composite panel system were undertaken at a higher load ratio using a gas furnace designed to deliver heat in accordance with the standard time temperature curve in AS 1530. 4 (SA, 2005). Fire tests included the measurements of load-deformation characteristics of LSF walls until failure as well as associated time-temperature measurements across the thickness and along the length of all the specimens. Tests of LSF walls under axial compression load have shown the improvement to their fire performance and fire resistance rating when the new composite panel was used. Hence this research recommends the use of the new composite panel system for cold-formed LSF walls. The numerical study was undertaken using a finite element program ABAQUS. The finite element analyses were conducted under both steady state and transient state conditions using the measured hot and cold flange temperature distributions from the fire tests. The elevated temperature reduction factors for mechanical properties were based on the equations proposed by Dolamune Kankanamge and Mahendran (2011). These finite element models were first validated by comparing their results with experimental test results from this study and Kolarkar (2010). The developed finite element models were able to predict the failure times within 5 minutes. The validated model was then used in a detailed numerical study into the strength of cold-formed thin-walled steel channels used in both the conventional and the new composite panel systems to increase the understanding of their behaviour under nonuniform elevated temperature conditions and to develop fire design rules. The measured time-temperature distributions obtained from the fire tests were used. Since the fire tests showed that the plasterboards provided sufficient lateral restraint until the failure of LSF wall panels, this assumption was also used in the analyses and was further validated by comparison with experimental results. Hence in this study of LSF wall studs, only the flexural buckling about the major axis and local buckling were considered. A new fire design method was proposed using AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005), NAS (AISI, 2007) and Eurocode 3 Part 1. 3 (ECS, 2006). The importance of considering thermal bowing, magnified thermal bowing and neutral axis shift in the fire design was also investigated. A spread sheet based design tool was developed based on the above design codes to predict the failure load ratio versus time and temperature for varying LSF wall configurations including insulations. Idealised time-temperature profiles were developed based on the measured temperature values of the studs. This was used in a detailed numerical study to fully understand the structural behaviour of LSF wall panels. Appropriate equations were proposed to find the critical temperatures for different composite panels, varying in steel thickness, steel grade and screw spacing for any load ratio. Hence useful and simple design rules were proposed based on the current cold-formed steel structures and fire design standards, and their accuracy and advantages were discussed. The results were also used to validate the fire design rules developed based on AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005) and Eurocode Part 1. 3 (ECS, 2006). This demonstrated the significant improvements to the design method when compared to the currently used prescriptive design methods for LSF wall systems under fire conditions. In summary, this research has developed comprehensive experimental and numerical thermal and structural performance data for both the conventional and the proposed new load bearing LSF wall systems under standard fire conditions. Finite element models were developed to predict the failure times of LSF walls accurately. Idealized hot <b>flange</b> temperature <b>profiles</b> were developed for non-insulated, cavity and externally insulated load bearing wall systems. Suitable fire design rules and spread sheet based design tools were developed based on the existing standards to predict the ultimate failure load, failure times and failure temperatures of LSF wall studs.

The results from this research are useful to both structural and fire engineers and researchers. Most importantly, this research has significantly improved the knowledge and understanding of cold-formed LSF loadbearing walls under standard fire conditions...|$|R
