50|$|The {{fruit body}} of the fungus is grayish or olive-brown, saddle- or mitral-shaped (i.e., {{resembling}} a <b>double</b> <b>mitre)</b> and is attached only {{to the top of}} the stipe; it may be up to 3 cm wide. The stipe is white, solid or filled with loosely stuffed hyphae, has a smooth surface, and is up to 8 cm long by 1 cm thick. The flesh of H. elastica is brittle and thin. The odor and taste of this mushroom are not distinctive.|$|E
50|$|Brindley's {{reputation}} soon {{spread and}} he was soon commissioned to construct more canals. He extended the Bridgewater to Runcorn, connecting it to his next major work, the Trent and Mersey Canal. At this time Brindley had never built a lock and he first built an experimental lock in the grounds of Turnhurst, a house he had bought near the summit, and this determined {{the design of the}} narrow canal lock which characterised most of the canals in the Midlands, with a single upper gate and <b>double</b> <b>mitre</b> lower gates. These were for an elongated version of the boats designed for the underground system at Worsley, the so-called 'starvationers', which were subsequently known as narrowboats and this decision was to cast a long shadow on the English canal system.|$|E
40|$|Ho Chi Minh City is flooded on {{a regular}} basis {{due to the lack of}} flood protection. Plans have been made to protect the city from {{flooding}} in the future and therefore a barrier is built at Phu Dinh. This barrier needs to fulfil three requirements. Firstly it should protect HCMC against a flood, as well resulting from tidal waves as from peak rains. Secondly during the dry season it should keep the water level above a minimum. Thirdly, while performing the first two requirements, navigation should be hindered barely. In order to find the ideal design first 3 variants were selected from 17 options with a MCA. Two of these variants were merged because of additional research. Variant A, two locks and a culvert dam, and variant B, a lock with a tidal barrier, were made into a preliminary design. These designs were compared with a new MCA and variant A was chosen as the best design. Variant A consists of a big and a small lock in order to keep the navigation possible during flood protection. When possible the big lock can be opened for free navigation due to its lift gates. The small lock will be built with <b>double</b> <b>mitre</b> gates. Between the locks a dam with culverts is built to close of the river and provide the needed conveyance area for the outflow of rain water. This design meets the requirements stated about flood protection, outflow regulation and navigation. The risks during operation are low because of the double set of doors in both locks. Because there are two locks the chances are low that the navigation will ever be totally obstructed. The estimated costs of this variant are VND 1150 billion (â‚¬ 46 million). It is recommended to look at improving the barrier by building a bridge over it. Surrounding the barrier there are no embankments present, therefore in order for the barrier to function these have to be built. Further the application of pumps in the culvert can lower the risks of a flooding due to rain, when investigating this it is important to do research on the catchment and conveyance area in the city the barrier has to deal with. During the investigation it was hard to make a good estimation about the importance of stakeholders and MCA criteria. Therefore more experience with the local environment could improve the design.

40|$|A finite-element Galerkin {{formulation}} {{has been}} developed to study transverse magnetic (TM) wave propagation in 2 -D S-curved ducts with both perfectly conducting and absorbing walls. The reflection and transmission at the entrances and the exits of the curved ducts are determined by coupling the finite-element solutions in the curved ducts to the eigenfunctions of an infinite, uniform, perfectly conducting duct. Example solutions are presented for a <b>double</b> <b>mitred</b> and S-ducts of various lengths. The length of the S-duct is found to significantly effect the reflective characteristics of the duct. Also, the effect of curvature on an absorbing duct is illustrated...|$|R
50|$|Notwithstanding {{the story}} of the first plane he sold being a cast one, almost without {{exception}} the firm's early planes were dovetailed, many with screwed sides and many with the lever cap and screw system for holding the cutter. The Garden Street leaflet published in the 1850s shows a wide array of infill planes available: panel, rebate (single and <b>double</b> iron), <b>mitre</b> (with snecked iron), smoothing and joining planes, some with wedged cutters and others with lever and cap. Later in the century bull-nose rebates planes were developed by Spiers, and shoulder, chariot and thumb planes were also added to the range. Gun-metal was introduced for making plane sides and lever caps.|$|R
