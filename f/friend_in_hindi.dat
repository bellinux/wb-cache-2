50|$|The second English dub {{was heavily}} edited and redubbed in Canada in 1985, solely for {{broadcast}} there. In the Canadian version, {{most of the}} characters had different names from their American counterparts. Due to laws which required a specific amount of Canadian content, the Canadian version also featured a pre-title sequence which recapped Astro's origin, and an epilogue where Astro would give a brief report about each episode's adventure to a computer named Geronimo. Astro's report would always contain a minor error about the story, and a narrator would encourage the viewers to find Astro's mistake, and compare answers with their <b>friends.</b> <b>In</b> India, the <b>Hindi</b> dubbed version of this show was broadcast on Pogo from 2008 to 2009.|$|R
500|$|Mukesh Chhabra was the film's casting director. Swara Bhaskar was {{the first}} to be cast in the role of Chanda Sahay, a single mother of a 15-year-old girl. Initially sceptical about playing a mother on screen early in her career, she changed her mind after reading the script. To {{understand}} the role better, Bhaskar stayed with professional domestic helpers from Agra, Uttar Pradesh, where the film is set. She bought such props as a handbag, a comb, a pocket mirror, and rubber chappals. She also drew guidance from her mother's experiences of handling a teenage daughter. After the film's release, Bhaskar {{said in an interview with}} Daily News and Analysis that her <b>friends</b> <b>in</b> the <b>Hindi</b> film industry advised her not to take up the role as they felt it would be a [...] "career suicide" [...] for her. She agreed to participate in the project because [...] "the story stayed in [...] mind". The next role to be cast was that of the 15-year-old daughter of the protagonist. Ria Shukla was selected for the role after auditions in Lucknow. Ratna Pathak and Pankaj Tripathi play supporting roles in the film.
