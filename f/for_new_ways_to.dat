2500|$|In 1903, German philosopher Carl Buttenstedt {{published}} his marriage guidebook [...] "Die Glücksehe – Die Offenbarung im Weibe, eine Naturstudie" [...] (The Marriage of Happiness – The Revelation in the Woman, {{a study from}} nature), in which he described and recommended the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) {{as a form of}} contraception and natural family planning that also deepens the relationship between wife and husband. He explicitly described erotic lactation as a source of great sexual pleasure for both partners, claiming that this is intended by nature especially {{on the part of the}} woman. This particular aspect of his broader general marriage philosophy gained a lot of attention and sparked wide debate. While some welcomed Buttenstedt's advice as inspirational <b>for</b> <b>new</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> improve sexual satisfaction between marriage partners, others warned that this technique could [...] "pathologically increase sexual sensation of both partners."

2500|$|In March 2012, Dell reassigned Snowden to Hawaii as lead {{technologist}} for the NSA's information-sharing office. At {{the time}} of his departure from the U.S. in May 2013, he had been employed for 15 months inside the NSA's Hawaii regional operations center, which focuses on the electronic monitoring of China and North Korea, the last three of which were with consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. While intelligence officials have described his position there as a system administrator, Snowden has said he was an infrastructure analyst, which meant that his job was to look <b>for</b> <b>new</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> break into Internet and telephone traffic around the world. On March 15, 2013—three days after what he later called his [...] "breaking point" [...] of [...] "seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress"—Snowden quit his job at Dell. Although he has stated that his career high annual salary was $200,000, Snowden said he took a pay cut to work at Booz Allen, where he sought employment in order to gather data and then release details of the NSA's worldwide surveillance activity. According to a Reuters story by Mark Hosenball, while in Hawaii, Snowden may have misled 20–25 co-workers into giving him their logins and passwords under false pretenses. NBC News subsequently reported that the NSA sent a memo to Congress suggesting that Snowden had tricked a fellow employee into sharing his personal public key infrastructure certificate to gain greater access to the NSA's computer system. This report was disputed, with Snowden himself saying in January 2014, [...] "With all due respect to Mark Hosenball, the Reuters report that put this out there was simply wrong. I never stole any passwords, nor did I trick an army of co-workers." [...] Booz Allen terminated Snowden's employment on June 10, 2013, one month after he had left the country.|$|E
