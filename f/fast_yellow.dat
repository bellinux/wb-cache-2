50|$|<b>Fast</b> <b>Yellow</b> AB is an azo dye. It {{used to be}} used as a food dye, {{designated}} in Europe by the E number E105. It is now delisted in both Europe and USA and {{is forbidden}} if used in foods and drinks, as toxicological data has shown it is harmful. E105 has been implicated in non-atopic asthma.|$|E
40|$|In {{a global}} economy the {{packaging}} industry has explored the usage of thermochromic ink to create a visual impact. The {{purpose of this study}} was to measure the color intensity of Matsui Chromicolor screen printing ink. The appearance of a product has the ability to attract attention from potential consumers. For this study both the scientific method and elite and specialized interviews were used to determine the reliability of Matsui Chromicolor ink. Samples of both Brilliant Green Type 27 and <b>Fast</b> <b>Yellow</b> Type 27 ink were heated in a scientific oven according to Matsui specifications. The results indicate that Matsui has been able to reach a degree of consistency in their ink, which could lead to consistent production, and appearance of color on products printed with thermochromic ink. There are potential areas for improvement within the thermochromic ink industry. However, further research is needed to test the accuracy of thermochromic ink...|$|E

The adsorption of <b>fast</b> <b>yellow</b> dye onto dried biomass Padina pavonica was studied in batch experiments. The amount of dye adsorbed (mg/g) was increased {{with the increase in}} initial dye concentration. An equilibrium time of about 90 min was achieved for dye concentrations ranging from 5 to 160 mg/L with maximum removal percentage of 73. 2 %. Pseudo-first and second order kinetic models have been used to analyze the adsorption data. The pseudo second-order kinetic model adequately described the adsorption data with correlation coefficient between 0. 96 and 1. 084. Fourier transform infra-red analysis demonstrated the chelating character of the dye molecule to different functionalities groups of the alga. Stirring speed higher than 50 rpm revealed no significant changes in dye adsorption. Temperature ranging from 15 ˚C to 65 ˚C showed stability followed by a decrease in adsorption. Scanning electron microscopy of adsorbent particles showed a high surface porosity allowing the free passage of dye molecules...|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of insoluble protein aggregates in intra and perinuclear inclusions is {{a hallmark of}} Huntington's disease (HD) and related glutamine-repeat disorders. A central question is whether protein aggregation plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative diseases. Here we show by using a filter retardation assay that the mAb 1 C 2, which specifically recognizes the elongated polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch in huntingtin, and the chemical compounds Congo red, thioflavine S, chrysamine G, and Direct <b>fast</b> <b>yellow</b> inhibit HD exon 1 protein aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, potential inhibitors of amyloid-β formation such as thioflavine T, gossypol, melatonin, and rifampicin {{had little or no}} inhibitory effect on huntingtin aggregation in vitro. The results obtained by the filtration assay were confirmed by electron microscopy, SDS/PAGE, and MS. Furthermore, cell culture studies revealed that the Congo red dye at micromolar concentrations reduced the extent of HD exon 1 aggregation in transiently transfected COS cells. Together, these findings contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanism of huntingtin fibrillogenesis in vitro and provide the basis for the development of new huntingtin aggregation inhibitors that may be effective in treating HD...|$|E
40|$|Pd-based {{catalytic}} reduction {{has emerged as}} an advanced treatment technology for drinking water decontamination, and a suite of persistent contaminants including oxyanions, N-nitrosoamines, and halogenated compounds are amenable to {{catalytic reduction}}. The primary goal {{of this study is}} to develop novel Pd-based catalysts with enhanced performance (i. e., activity, selectivity, and sustainability) to remove contaminants from drinking water. The effects of water quality (i. e., co-contaminants in water matrix), catalyst support, and catalyst metal were explored, and they provide insights for preparing catalysts with faster kinetics, higher selectivity, and extended lifetime. Azo dyes are wide-spread contaminants, and they are potentially co-exisiting with target contaminants amenable for catalytic removal. The probe azo dye methyl orange (MO) enhanced catalytic reduction kinetics of a suite of oxyanions (i. e., nitrate, nitrite, bromate, chlorate, and perchlorate) and diatrizoate significantly but not N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) with a variety of Pd-based catalysts. Nitrate was selected as a probe contaminant, and several different azo dyes (i. e., methyl orange, methyl red, <b>fast</b> <b>yellow</b> AB, metanil yellow, acid orange 7, congo red, eriochrome black T, acid red 27, acid yellow 11, and acid yellow 17) were evaluated for their ability to enhance reduction. A hydrogen atom shuttling mechanism was proposed and a kinetic model was proposed based on Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) theory, and they suggest sorbed azo dyes and reduced hydrazo dyes shuttle hydrogen atoms to oxyanions or diatrizoate t...|$|E

40|$|This acid is a {{component}} of <b>Fast</b> <b>Yellow</b> G and, {{because it is not}} solid, is not used generally as dyestuff. But it is important as an infermediate product of fast disazodyes, such as Crocein Scarlet etc. Finding it necessary to obtain a pure p-aminoazobenzensulphonic acid as component of the Chlorantine Fast Dyes (Red 5 BL, 7 BL and Bordeux BLL,), the auther made the following study on the preparation of the acid. The preparation of this pure acid with a good yield offers some difucuties. By sulphonating aminoazobenzene a product may be obtained, which consists mostly of the same monosulphoryic acid, but contains also some of disulphonic acid and possibly isomeric monosulphoryic acid. This product does not give the resired shade and properties, which are obtainable by pure p-sulbphonic acid. The method of coupling diazotised sulphanilic acid with aniline gives a poor yield. If, however, some easily hydrolysed derivatives of aniline, such as acylaniline, methylaniline-w-sulphonic acid etc., are used, coupling may be successful in certain cases. In the present work, according to the method used in G. P. 217935, aniline is acylated with p-toluenesul-phochloride. The preparation then proceeds as fallows, 93 parts of aniline are suspended in 1100 parts of water and 45 parts of caustic soda, acylated with 190 parts of p-toluenesulphochloride under rapid stirring. p-Toluenesulphochloride thus obtained is then dissolved in 1800 parts of water and 180 parts of caustic soda solution (40 %). 210 parts of sulphanilic acid are diazotized as usual and added to the above cooled solution of p-toluenesulphochloride. p-Toluenesulphoaminoazobenzenesulphonic acid is separated, and when coupling is finished, it is acidfied, filtered off and washed. The wet cake (60 % water contect) is then stirred with 3550 parts of concentrated sulphulic acid and the mixture warmed at 75 ℃ for 2 hours. When the solution is poured into 3000 parts of ice water, a free p-aminoazobenzensulphonic acid is precipitated, filtered off and recrystallised from 3500 parts of ammoniacal water. The yield of ammoniumsalt is 204 parts (69 %) ...|$|E

40|$|Using an {{open air}} flow system, {{differences}} in the yellowing rate of leaves during curing were assessed in relation to ethylene production by shoots of intact seedlings or attached mature leaves of 60 day old tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants. The rate of ethylene evolution from {{the leaves of the}} <b>fast</b> <b>yellowing</b> cultivars was significantly higher than in the slow yellowing ones. The same differences were obtained with shoots of intact seedlings. The findings suggest {{that it is possible to}} use ethylene production by seedlings as a selection criterion in screening for genotypic {{differences in the}} rate of yellowing. The ability of carbon dioxide (1 %) to enhance ethylene production by attached leaves was significant in a slow, but not in a <b>fast</b> <b>yellowing</b> cultivar. However, similar amounts of ethylene were produced on administration of 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid to a slow and a <b>fast</b> <b>yellowing</b> cultivar. Exposure of attached leaves to exogenous ethylene (0. 1 microliter per liter) accelerated the loss of chlorophyll and protein. This treatment was effective only for slightly yellow leaves and not for fully expanded green ones. The significance and possible use of ethylene in the flue-curing process are discussed...|$|R
