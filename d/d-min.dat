50|$|Over {{the active}} dynamic range of most films, {{the density of}} the {{developed}} film is proportional to the logarithm of the total amount of light to which the film was exposed, so the transmission coefficient of the developed film is proportional to a power of the reciprocal of the brightness of the original exposure. The plot of {{the density of the}} film image against the log of the exposure is known as an H&D curve. This effect is due to the statistics of grain activation: as the film becomes progressively more exposed, each incident photon is less likely to impact a still-unexposed grain, yielding the logarithmic behavior. A simple, idealized statistical model yields the equation , where light is proportional to the number of photons hitting a unit area of film, k is the probability of a single photon striking a grain (based {{on the size of the}} grains and how closely spaced they are), and density is the proportion of grains that have been hit by at least one photon. The relationship between density and log exposure is linear for photographic films except at the extreme ranges of maximum exposure (D-max) and minimum exposure (<b>D-min)</b> on an H&D curve, so the curve is characteristically S-shaped (as opposed to digital camera sensors which have a linear response through the effective exposure range. The sensitivity (i.e., the ISO speed) of a film can be affected by changing the length or temperature of development, which would move the H&D curve to the left or right (see figure).|$|E
40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} {{is a powerful}} tool for ultraviolet (UV) reactor performance evaluation, since it allows the reactor configuration optimization by comparing the performance indicator [e. g., reduction equivalent dose (RED) ] of various UV reactors. In this study, a new performance indicator independent of the microbial UV dose-response curve, namely particle minimum UV dose (<b>D-min),</b> was introduced, and its feasibility was evaluated in the configuration optimization of 3 -lamp UV reactors for water disinfection. Results indicate that the <b>D-min</b> could serve {{as an alternative to the}} RED in characterizing the UV reactor performance. In general, reactors with a normal (NOR) lamp position pattern (i. e., with one lamp on the top and two at the bottom) had larger <b>D-min</b> values (110 - 193 mW cm(- 2)) than those with a reverse (REV) lamp position pattern (i. e., with two lamps on the top and one at the bottom) (98 - 160 mW cm(- 2)). The largest <b>D-min</b> (193 mW cm(- 2)) was obtained in an UV reactor with a lamp relative distance (i. e., the ratio of the distance between the lamp and reactor axes to the reactor radius) of 0. 4 and an inlet internal diameter of 75 mm, which could be ascribed to a well-mixed flow resulting from an optimal dispersion of the influent flow by the lamp array. The maximum disinfection flow rate of the UV reactor with the optimal configuration was elevated by 47 - 100 % compared to those of the non-optimally designed reactors, which led to an energy saving efficiency of 32 - 50 %.

40|$|The {{results of}} eddy {{covariance}} observation system could represent the physical process at certain {{area of the}} surface. Thus point-to-area representativeness was of primary interest in flux observation. This research presents a preliminary study for flux observation at ChinaFLUX sites {{by the use of}} observation data and Flux Source Area Model (FSAM). Results show that the footprint expands and is further away from flux tower when atmosphere becomes more stable, the observation height increases, or the surfaces become smoother. This suggests that the area represented by the flux observation becomes larger. The distances from the reference point to the maximum point S-max and the minimum point x(1) of source weight function (D-max and <b>D-min,</b> respectively) can be influenced by atmosphere stability which becomes longer when atmosphere is more stable. For more rough surfaces and lower observation point D-max and <b>D-min</b> become shorter. This research gives the footprint at level P= 90 % at ChinaFLUX sites at different atmosphere stability. The preliminary results of spatial representiveness at ChinaFLUX sites were given based on the dominant wind direction and footprint response to various factors. The study also provides some theoretical basis for data quality control and evaluating data uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|Attenuation in wave {{propagation}} in soils is {{the decay of}} the wave amplitude. Total attenuation arises from geometric spreading, apparent attenuation, and material losses (intrinsic attenuation). Intrinsic attenuation is typically quantified {{in terms of the}} damping ratio, D. In laboratory tests, the damping ratio measurement is in general implemented under quasi-static and resonant conditions. Under both conditions, only material losses are reflected in the measured total attenuation. It should be noted that damping ratios measured by different techniques taken under various frequencies may not be comparable if the damping ratio is viscous in nature. For in-situ testing, corrections for geometric spreading and apparent attenuation are required to obtain the material damping ratio. The spectral ratio method is an effective way to make such corrections. Preliminary studies conducted in a K-o-container in the laboratory show that the measured damping ratio by the spectral ratio method (<b>D-min</b> similar to 4 %) is much higher than the measured ratio by the resonant column test (<b>D-min</b> similar to 0. 23 %), although the coupling effects including the transducer response are considered. This discrepancy may be due to interference of the sensor with the propagating wave, multiple reflections from the boundary, near field effects, phase delay and signal distortion from the peripheral electronic devices, and other unknown factors...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{accuracy}} of statistical parameters of dose distributions in brachytherapy using actual clinical implants. These include the mean, minimum and maximum dose values and the variance of the dose distribution inside the PTV (planning target volume), and {{on the surface of}} the PTV. These properties have been studied as a function of the number of uniformly distributed sampling points. These parameters, or the variants of these parameters, are used directly or indirectly in optimization procedures or for a description of the dose distribution. The accurate determination of these parameters depends on the sampling point distribution from which they have been obtained. Some optimization methods ignore catheters and critical structures surrounded by the PTV or alternatively consider as surface dose points only those on the contour lines of the PTV. <b>D-min</b> and D-max are extreme dose values which are either on the PTV surface or within the PTV. They must be avoided for specification and optimization purposes in brachytherapy. Using D-mean and the variance of D which we have shown to be stable parameters, achieves a more reliable description of the dose distribution on the PTV surface and within the PTV volume than does <b>D-min,</b> and D,,. Generation of dose points on the real surface of the PTV is obligatory and the consideration of catheter volumes results in a realistic description of anatomical dose distributions.

40|$|Purpose: Rotations of the {{prostate}} gland induce considerable geometric uncertainties in prostate cancer radiation therapy. Collimator and gantry angle adjustments can correct these rotations in intensity modulated radiation therapy. Modern volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatments, however, include {{a wide range of}} beam orientations that differ in modulation, and corrections require dynamic collimator rotations. The aim {{of this study was to}} implement a rotation correction strategy for VMAT dose delivery and validate it for left-right prostate rotations. Methods and Materials: Clinical VMAT treatment plans of 5 prostate cancer patients were used. Simulated left-right prostate rotations between + 15 degrees and - 15 degrees were corrected by collimator rotations. We compared corrected and uncorrected plans by dose volume histograms, minimum dose (<b>D-min)</b> to {{the prostate}}, bladder surface receiving >= 78 Gy (S 78) and rectum equivalent uniform dose (EUD; n= 0. 13). Each corrected plan was delivered to a phantom, and its deliverability was evaluated by gamma-evaluation between planned and delivered dose, which was reconstructed from portal images acquired during delivery. Results: On average, clinical target volume minimum dose (<b>D-min)</b> decreased up to 10 % without corrections. Negative left-right rotations were corrected almost perfectly, whereas Dmin remained within 4 % for positive rotations. Bladder S 78 and rectum EUD of the corrected plans matched those of the original plans. The average pass rate for the corrected plans delivered to the phantom was 98. 9 % at 3 % per 3 mm gamma criteria. The measured dose in the planning target volume approximated the original dose, rotated around the simulated left-right angle, well. Conclusions: It is feasible to dynamically adjust the collimator angle during VMAT treatment delivery to correct for prostate rotations. This technique can safely correct for left-right prostate rotations up to 15 degrees. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserve...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{this pilot}} study we {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} a substitute CT (s-CT) image derived from MR data of the brain, as a basis for optimization of intensity modulated rotational therapy, final dose calculation and derivation of reference images for patient positioning. Methods: S-CT images were created using a Gaussian mixture regression model on five patients previously treated with radiotherapy. Optimizations were compared using D-max, <b>D-min,</b> D-median and D-mean measures for the target volume and relevant risk structures. Final dose calculations were compared using gamma index with 1 %/ 1 mm and 3 %/ 3 mm acceptance criteria. 3 D geometric evaluation was conducted using the DICE similarity coefficient for bony structures. 2 D geometric comparison of digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) was performed by manual delineation of relevant structures on the s-CT DRR that were transferred to the CT DRR and compared by visual inspection. Results: Differences for the target volumes in optimization comparisons were small in general, e. g. a mean difference in both <b>D-min</b> and D-max within similar to 0. 3 %. For the final dose calculation gamma evaluations, 100 % of the voxels passed the 1 %/ 1 mm criterion within the PTV. Within the entire external volume between 99. 4 % and 100 % of the voxels passed the 3 %/ 3 mm criterion. In the 3 D geometric comparison, the DICE index varied between approximately 0. 8 - 0. 9, depending on the position in the skull. In the 2 D DRR comparisons, no appreciable visual differences were found. Conclusions: Even though the present work involves a limited number of patients, the results provide a strong indication that optimization and dose calculation based on s-CT data is accurate regarding both geometry and dosimetry...|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} true triaxial {{box with}} individually applied stress system {{is used to}} model the in-situ cross-hole and down-hole seismic tests, and hence determine the small-strain shear modulus and damping ratio, i. e. G(max) and <b>D-min.</b> The method suggested by ISSMGE TC 10 in finding the S-wave arrival time is found to yield consistent results {{when compared with the}} one obtained by the cross-correlation peak of two receiver signals. The spectral ratio method integrated with the self-healing technique gives similar damping ratios as in resonant column tests under isotropic confinement. Experimental results provide further evidence that shear modulus is only dependent on the principle stresses in the direction of shear wave propagation and polarization. The damping ratio, however, is independent of the principle stress changes, regardless of its direction with respect to the polarization plane. The cross-hole test yields better results than down-hole test in this laboratory modeling...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} effects of {{structure}} on the mechanical responses of kaolinite with known and controlled fabric associations. The dynamic properties and strength were assessed by resonant column tests and undrained triaxial compression tests, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that interparticle forces and associated fabric arrangements influence the volumetric change under isotropic compression. Soils with different structures have individual consolidation lines, and the merging trend is not readily seen under an isotropic confinement up to 250 kPa. The dynamic properties of kaolinite {{were found to be}} intimately related to the soil structure. Stronger interparticle forces or higher degrees of flocculated structure lead to a greater small-strain shear modulus, G(max), and a lower associated damping ratio, <b>D-min.</b> The soil structure has no apparent influence on the critical-state friction angle (phi'(c) = 27. 5 degrees), which suggests that the critical stress ratio does not depend on interparticle forces. The undrained shear strength of kaolinite is controlled by its initial packing density rather than by any interparticle attractive forces, and yet the influence of the structure on the effective stress path is obvious...|$|E
40|$|Given {{an array}} of $n$ {{elements}} from a total order, we propose encodings that support various range queries (range minimum, range maximum and their variants), and previous and next smaller/larger value queries. When query time is not of concern, we obtain a $ 4. 088 n + o(n) $-bit encoding that supports all these queries. For the case {{when we need to}} support all these queries in constant time, we give an encoding that takes $ 4. 585 n + o(n) $ bits, where $n$ is the length of input array. This improves the $ 5. 08 n+o(n) $-bit encoding obtained by encoding the colored $ 2 d$-Min and Max heaps proposed by Fischer~[TCS, 2011]. We first extend the original DFUDS [Algorithmica, 2005] encoding of the colored 2 <b>d-Min</b> (Max) heap that supports the queries in constant time. Then, we combine the extended DFUDS of $ 2 d$-Min heap and $ 2 d$-Max heap using the Min-Max encoding of Gawrychowski and Nicholson [ICALP, 2015] with some modifications. We also obtain encodings that take lesser space and support a subset of these queries. Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures (with added details in Figure 3 wrt the journal version...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal {{complications}} in diabetes {{may affect}} glucose and endocrine homeostasis. Glucosedependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1), and leptin regulate glucose homeostasis, food intake, and gastric emptying. AIM: The {{aim was to}} investigate associations between diabetes complications and glucose homeostasis and plasma levels of GIP, GLP- 1, and leptin. METHODS: Sixteen diabetes patients (seven men) were examined with gastric emptying scintigraphy and 72 -h continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring, 14 with the deep-breathing test, and 12 with esophageal manometry. A fiber-rich breakfast was given during {{the second day of}} glucose registration. Blood samples were taken 10 min and right before a fat-rich breakfast, as well as 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min afterwards. 20 healthy volunteers acted as controls. Plasma was analyzed regarding GIP, GLP- 1, and leptin by Luminex. RESULTS: Gastroparesis lowered maximal concentration (c-max) (p = 0. 003) and total area under the curve (tAUC) (p = 0. 019) of glucose levels as well as <b>d-min</b> (p = 0. 043) of leptin levels. It tended to lower baseline (p = 0. 073), c-max (p = 0. 066), change from baseline (dmax) (p = 0. 073), and tAUC (p = 0. 093) of GLP- 1 concentrations. Esophageal dysmotility tended to lower tAUC of glucose levels (p = 0. 063), and c-min (p = 0. 065) and tAUC (p = 0. 063) of leptin levels. Diabetes patients had a higher baseline concentration of glucose (p = 0. 013), GIP (p = 0. 023), and leptin (p = 0. 019) compared with healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Gastric and esophageal dysmotility are associated with both lesser increases in postprandial glucose elevations and decreased postprandial changes in GLP- 1 and leptin...|$|E
40|$|Bruising, {{damage caused}} by impact on the fruit during harvesting, is a major {{limiting}} factor {{in the production of}} table olives and currently restricts the applicability of mechanical harvesting. Bruising is characterized by darkening of the olive fruit surface and softening of the mesocarp or pulp. It decreases final product quality and may cause consumer rejection. This paper describes and quantifies anatomical changes in the olive mesocarp (pulp) related to bruising in fresh olive fruits after an induced impact. The study assessed two harvested table olive cultivars differing in bruise susceptibility (‘Manzanilla de Sevilla’ and ‘Hojiblanca’) at two different times (4 and 24 h after induced impact). Qualitative observations of tissue bruising prior and after histological analysis revealed changes in the damaged mesocarp including ruptured cells, loss of cell wall thickness, and discoloration in the damaged areas. These changes appeared greater in ‘Manzanilla de Sevilla’ than ‘Hojiblanca’, and more evident 24 h after the impact. Bruising damage was quantified using eleven parameters related to the area of the damaged zone, and incidence and position of tissue ruptures. Nine of these parameters changed significantly with time, and significant differences were observed between the two cultivars studied in seven of the parameters. Three of these, the total damaged area (TDA) measured in mesocarp portions prior to histological procedure, the number of tissue ruptures in the mesocarp intersected by circumferential arc 2 (located at one-fourth of the pulp thickness from the fruit exterior; Brk-arc 2), and the distance from the fruit exterior) to the first found tissue rupture (<b>D-min)),</b> measured in histological preparations, were the most discriminating and easy to assess parameters, and are thus recommended for the evaluation of susceptibility to bruising among harvested table olive cultivars.

Based on {{an analysis of the}} NREL/NASA Ames test, a model is proposed, which uses the difference between the pressure on the blade with 3 D flow effects and the pressure from the 2 D wind tunnel test. Application of the new model on three different rotors showed, that the agreement between the new model and measurements were good concerning the thrust and the agreement was fair concerning the power. Compared to existing 3 D correction models the correspondence between power and thrust was better predicted using the new model. This indicates that using the new model results in a more correct load distribution on the rotor.

40|$|The {{periodic}} alternation {{of light}} and darkness over the solar day {{has a fundamental role}} in synchronising human circadian rhythms. Artificial light is known to alter circadian timing depending on time of administration; early morning light can advance circadian timing while late evening light can delay circadian rhythms. Nevertheless, {{there is a lack of}} research on how manipulations of the body clock, via bright light, can enhance human performance and/or alleviate the effects of jet-lag after transmeridian travel. The doctoral programme communicated in the present thesis was designed to fill some of these gaps in knowledge. In the first experiment, the acute effects of light exposure on thermoregulation, pineal function and autonomic nervous system function (indicated by the rate pressure product) were examined. At 20 : 00 h, eight healthy men were exposed to a baseline period of dim light « 12 lux) for 45 min followed by 0 lux for another 60 min. Thereafter, participants were exposed to either polychromatic bright light with blue photons (2500 lux), blue photons removed (2, 500 lux) or 0 lux for 30 min. Baseline data was altered for all variables in the two light conditions, suggesting an "expectancy effect" [...] There was evidence that light attenuated the nocturnal fall in core body temperature and rise in melatonin. These data highlight that the circadian system and other areas of the brain which are stimulated by light are still sensitive to short duration exposure and these effects are amplified by the inclusion of blue spectrum light. In a follow-up study, the effects of light exposure (blue photons included polychromatic bright light vs. no light) on subsequent early morning performance were examined under conditions of thermal stress. Participants were woken at 06 : 30 h. At 07 : 00, participants entered an environmental chamber set at 35 °C and 60 % relative humidity. Three 10 -min bouts of exercise (55 % V 02 max) were completed on a cycle ergometer with each bout separated with 10 min of passive recovery. Participants then completed a 10 -km cycling time-trial. Core body temperature was measured every 30 s throughout the experiment using intestinal thermistors. The time of the sleep-trough in core temperature occurred approximately 1. 75 h later following bright light (L) vs. no light (NL) (p = 0. 07). Just prior to the time-trial, Tc was 0. 27 ± OA 2 °C lower in L than NL (p = 0. 07). The time trial was completed 1. 43 ± 0. 63 min quicker in L vs. NL (p = 0. 001). Immediately after the time trial, intestinal temperature was 38. 21 ± 0. 56 °C in BL compared to 38. 64 ± 0. 42 "C in NL (p = 0. 10). These data provide the first evidence that a 3 <b>D-min</b> exposure to bright light prior to sleep can delay circadian timing to the extent that exercise performance is improved in hot conditions during the subsequent early morning. In the third study, the effects of a simulated dawn during the last 30 minutes of sleep on the subsequent dissipation of sleep inertia were examined and it was questioned whether subsequent improvements in simulated work and physical performance were mediated. Eight participants, who reported difficulty with morning waking, were administered in a random order to a control (C) and a dawn Simulation (OS) trial (starting 30 minutes prior to waking). Subjective ratings of sleep quality and alertness were obtained alongside measures of cognitive performance (addition and a reaction time tasks measured at 5, 30 and 75 minutes after waking at habitual workday times). Physical performance was also measured 35 minutes after waking using a self-paced cycling protocol. After waking in the OS condition, perceived sleep quality was 1. 16 ± 0. 89 (p = 0. 01) points higher compared with C. Ratings of alertness were significantly higher in OS than C throughou...|$|E
