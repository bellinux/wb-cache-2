5|$|The 1834 revolt and the {{immediate}} aftermath reduced the male population of Palestine by about one-fifth. This decrease is attributed to {{the large numbers of}} peasants who were either deported to Egypt to work in manufacturing, drafted into Egypt's military, or abandoned their villages and farms to join the Bedouin nomadic populations. Around 10,000 peasants were deported to Egypt and the general population was <b>disarmed.</b> The conscription orders were extended beyond the Muslim population to the local Christians. Taxes were also extended from landed property to include livestock as well.
