Objectives: To assess the association between the presence of migraine or tension-type headache and changes in longus colli muscle dimensions and sternocleidomastoid muscle activity. Method: An observational study with 48 women comparing the following groups: migraine (n= 21), tension-type headache (n= 16), and control (n= 11). The cross-sectional area, lateral and anteroposterior dimensions, and shape ratio of the longus colli muscle were measured using ultrasound. The activation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was assessed by signal amplitude and the decline in median frequency using surface electromyographic analysis. Results: The dimensions of the longus colli muscle did not differ between groups (p> 0. 05). Post-test analysis showed lower sternocleidomastoid muscle activation on both sides, at the onset of contraction, in the group with tension-type headache when compared to the control group {right sternocleidomastoid [tension-type headache: 0. 39 (0. 30 - 0. 49); control: 0. 58 (0. 42 - 0. 76); p= 0. 026] and left sternocleidomastoid [tension-type headache: 0. 39 (0. 31 - 0. 48); control: 0. 60 (0. 42 - 0. 79); p= 0. 039], Tukey's post hoc test}.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the development of tension in sheets of fibroblasts and the orien-tation of these cells and collagen fibres in collagen gels was examined. Cell-containing, three-dimensional collagen gels were established in agarose-coated Epon dies measuring 10 mm x 4 mm x 4 mm, to which pieces of demineralized tooth and bone had been attached at opposite <b>ends.</b> <b>Contraction</b> of the gel into an opaque structure suspended between the two particles occurred over 24 h and resulted in concave upper and lateral surfaces and a flat to slightly concave lower surface. Initial orientation of the fibres along the tooth—bone axis was followed by similar orientation of the cells. Gels cast without cells exhibited no change in dimensions. Release of the tooth particle after 12 or 24 h of incubation led to shortening of the contracted gels 5 min following release. This shortening was significantly greater (P < 0001) than that of uncontracted or slightly contracted gels (1 h and 3 h incubation). Gels attached at one end only compacted around the site of attachment but did not show orientation of cells or fibres. Gels containing colcemid or cytochalasin D were only slightly compacted and did not develop tension. Collagen fibres, but not cell in colcemid-containing gels, showed some alignment; neither were aligned {{in the presence of}} cytochalasin D. These data suggest that both microtubules and microfilaments are necessary for alignment of cells and the establishment of tension between two points of attachment in collagen gels. Furthermore, they lend support to our previously advanced hypothesis that the development of tension between two points can result in the orientation of the cells along an axis connecting the points of attachment. This could provide a mechanism for the development of oriented fibre system...|$|R

This positive feedback is known as calcium-induced calcium release [...] and gives rise to calcium sparks ( [...] sparks). The spatial and temporal summation of ~30,000 [...] sparks gives a cell-wide increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration. The cytoplasmic calcium binds to Troponin C, moving the tropomyosin complex off the actin binding site allowing the myosin head to bind to the actin filament. From this point on, the contractile mechanism is essentially the same as for skeletal muscle (above). Briefly, using ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head pulls the actin filament toward the centre of the sarcomere. Intracellular calcium is taken up by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase pump back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum ready for the next cycle to begin. Calcium is also ejected from the cell mainly by the sodium-calcium exchanger and, to a lesser extent, a plasma membrane calcium ATPase and/or taken up by the mitochondria. An enzyme, phospholamban, serves as a brake for the ATPase. At low heart rates, phospholamban is active and slows down the activity of the ATPase so that [...] does not have to leave the cell entirely. At high heart rates, phospholamban is phosphorylated and deactivated thus removing most [...] from the cell back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

The model duplicated the fast rise, slow creep rise, peak, and slow decline of tension seen in tetanic contractions of stretched living fibers.

40|$|A {{previous}} study suggested that muscles from hypocalorically fed rats were {{limited in their}} ability to rephosphorylate ADP. During muscle contraction hydrolysis of ATP results in an increase in phosphorus, free ADP, delta GATP, and a reduction in phosphocreatine levels that is reversed during rest by rephosphorylation of ADP to ATP and the resynthesis of phosphocreatine by ATP. We therefore hypothesized that these changes would be restored more slowly during postcontraction rest in hypocalorically fed rats as compared with controls. We compared controls fed ad lib to 2 -d fasted and hypocalorically fed rats, losing 20 % of their weight. We also compared hypocalorically fed rats that had been refed ad lib for 7 d with age-matched controls fed ad lib.

40|$|The {{issue of}} whether the {{likelihood}} of an expansion or <b>contraction</b> <b>ending</b> is dependent on its age, i. e whether they are duration dependent, is widely addressed in the business cycles literature and evidence of positive duration dependence is found in several studies. However, {{there is an important}} issue that has not been explored in this literature yet: the presence of change-points in duration dependence. All the studies in this field depart from the assumption that the magnitude of duration dependence is the same over time. However, we conjecture that the degree of likeliness of an expansion or <b>contraction</b> <b>ending</b> as it gets older might change after a specific duration. To test for that possibility, this paper will allow for the presence of a change-point in the analysis of the duration of expansions and contractions for a group of 13 European and Non-European industrial countries over the period 1948 - 2009. The evidence provided by the estimation of a continuous-time Weibull duration model shows strong support for the presence of positive duration dependence, which is stronger for contractions than for expansions. Results also show that contractions have become longer over time and that their length is negatively a¤ected by the length of the previous expansion. Most importantly, this paper provides quite interesting evidence for the presence of a change-point in duration dependence for expansions, but not for contractions. Results show that the magnitude of the duration dependence parameter decreases signi. cantly when an expansion surpasses 10 years of duration. In particular, evidence of positive duration dependence is no longer found when an expansion surpasses that threshold. business cycles; expansions; contractions; duration dependence. ...|$|R

Mutations are most frequently found in MYH 3 and are predicted to impair the function of embryonic myosin. We measured the contractile properties of individual skeletal muscle cells and the activation and relaxation kinetics of isolated myofibrils from two adult individuals with an R 672 C substitution in embryonic myosin and distal arthrogryposis syndrome 2 A (DA 2 A) or Freeman-Sheldon syndrome. In R 672 C-containing muscle cells, we observed reduced specific force, a prolonged time to relaxation and incomplete relaxation (elevated residual force). In R 672 C-containing muscle myofibrils, the initial, slower phase of relaxation had a longer duration and slower rate, and time to complete relaxation was greatly prolonged. These observations can be collectively explained by a small subpopulation of myosin cross-bridges with greatly reduced detachment kinetics, resulting in a slower and less complete deactivation of thin filaments at the <b>end</b> of <b>contractions.</b> These findings have important implications for selecting and testing directed therapeutic options for persons with DA 2 A and perhaps congenital contractures in general...|$|R

To shed light on these mechanisms, particularly the influences of central command and muscle afferent feedback, the present study tested the hypothesis that MSNA is greater during voluntary compared with electrically-evoked contractions. Seven male subjects performed a series of 1 -minute isometric dorsiflexion contractions (left leg) separated by 2 -minute rest periods, alternating between voluntary and electrically-evoked contractions at similar forces (5 - 10 % of maximum). MSNA was recorded continuously (microneurography) from the left peroneal nerve and quantified from cardiac-synchronised, negative-going spikes in the neurogram. Compared with pre-contraction values, MSNA increased by 51 ± 34 % (P 0. 05).
