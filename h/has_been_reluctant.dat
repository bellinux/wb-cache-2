5|$|Neuner's {{shooting}} performances {{have been}} a regular topic in the German media. At times she <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to discuss her shooting in interviews and has said the public's fixation on it contributes to the problem. She has insisted her difficulties in the standing position are not due to technical weaknesses but psychological, and her training results are {{just as good as}} the results of her team mates. She explained in interviews that she had developed a fear of the standing shooting over time, knowing she had to justify herself after the race if she missed. In 2008, Neuner trained with Bundeswehr shooting coach and former large calibre world champion, Rudi Krenn, and subsequently changed her stance slightly. Since 2009, she has worked with a psychologist, primarily focusing on mental techniques to build her confidence on the shooting range. Her standing position average has improved from 60% to 75% from 2008 to 2011. Neuner has been wearing ear plugs during some of the races in order to better concentrate while shooting. The individual race, which places a high emphasis on shooting, has traditionally been her worst discipline (each shooting error results in a one-minute time penalty, instead of a penalty loop).|$|E

25|$|The Constitutional {{system of}} checks and {{balances}} has not adequately controlled intelligence activities. Until recently the Executive branch has neither delineated the scope of permissible activities nor established procedures for supervising intelligence agencies. Congress has failed to exercise sufficient oversight, seldom questioning the use to which its appropriations were being put. Most domestic intelligence issues have not reached the courts, and in those cases when they have reached the courts, the judiciary <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to grapple with them.|$|E
25|$|One major {{long-term}} {{concern for}} the Japanese labor force is its low birthrate. In {{the first half of}} 2005, the number of deaths in Japan exceeded the number of births, indicating that the decline in population, initially predicted to start in 2007, had already started. While one countermeasure for a declining birthrate would be to remove barriers to immigration, despite taking new steps towards it, the Japanese government <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to do so, since foreign immigration to Japan has been unpopular among citizens.|$|E

In January 2010, Clijsters signed an endorsement deal with sports beverage AA drink. She was also endorsed by Belgian telecommunications company Telenet and banana producer Chiquita. She became the brand ambassador for the Citizen Watch Signature Collection in 2010. In 2011, Clijsters was named a Brand Ambassador of global nutritional company USANA. She is represented by Belgium sports, media and entertainment company Golazo Sports.|$|E

Melissa Locker, also writing for Time magazine, suggested that Beyoncé should work with Timbaland more often as [...] "his sultry beats paired with her R-rated lyrics and the catchy chorus 'It took 45 minutes to get all dressed up / And we ain’t even gonna make it to this club', make a captivating combination".

500|$|Changes {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{over the years to}} reduce possible inconsistencies between scorers and possible mistakes made by the official scorer, especially {{as the end of the}} writer-scorer era began to seem likely in the late 1970s. The BBWAA and professional baseball umpires have suggested the creation of a [...] "fifth umpire". Four-man umpire crews rotate officiating responsibilities after each game, and travel to several stadiums per year. This new fifth umpire would travel with the umpiring crew to score games and take his turn on the bases, but MLB <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to incur the increased cost. More recently, there have been suggestions to move the official scorer out of the press box and closer to the field behind the plate to get the best view of the game. MLB has conceded that this could be a good idea, but it is not currently feasible because of the design of most stadiums in the league.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Ali Al-Ahmed, {{director}} of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, likewise called for Saudi Arabia to be barred from the Games, describing its ban on women athletes {{as a violation of}} the International Olympic Committee charter. He noted: [...] "For the last 15 years, many international nongovernmental organisations worldwide have been trying to lobby the IOC for better enforcement of its own laws banning gender discrimination.... While their efforts did result in increasing numbers of women Olympians, the IOC <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to take a strong position and threaten the discriminating countries with suspension or expulsion." [...] In July 2010, The Independent reported: [...] "Pressure is growing on the International Olympic Committee to kick out Saudi Arabia, who are likely to be the only major nation not to include women in their Olympic team for 2012.... Should Saudi Arabia... send a male-only team to London, we understand they will face protests from equal rights and women's groups which threaten to disrupt the Games".|$|E
500|$|Historically, the actuarial {{profession}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> {{to specify}} the pass marks for its examinations ( [...] , [...] ). To address concerns that there are pre-existing pass/fail quotas, a former Chairman of the Board of Examiners of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries stated, [...] "Although students {{find it hard to}} believe, the Board of Examiners does not have fail quotas to achieve. Accordingly pass rates are free to vary (and do). They are determined by the quality of the candidates sitting the examination and in particular how well prepared they are. Fitness to pass is the criterion, not whether you can achieve a mark in the top 40% of candidates sitting." [...] In 2000, the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) decided to start releasing pass marks for the exams it offers [...] The CAS's policy is also not to grade to specific pass ratios; the CAS board affirmed in 2001 that [...] "the CAS shall use no predetermined pass ratio as a guideline for setting the pass mark for any examination. If the CAS determines that 70% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then those 70% should pass. Similarly, if the CAS determines that only 30% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then only those 30% should pass.".|$|E

However, on 8 November 2016 she posted a tweet congratulating Trump on his presidential victory. Nevertheless, her strategy has difficulties as her image seems to remain controversial: Germany's Angela Merkel has said she [...] "will contribute to make other political forces stronger than the National Front" [...] and Israel still holds a bad opinion of her party. Nigel Farage has said: [...] "I've never said a bad word about Marine Le Pen; I've never said a good word about her party".|$|E
2500|$|... no truly {{effective}} pesticides were available. Pesticides {{that have}} historically been found effective include pyrethroids, dichlorvos, and malathion. Resistance to pesticides has increased significantly over time, and harm to health from their use is of concern. The carbamate insecticide propoxur is highly toxic to bed bugs, but it has potential toxicity to children exposed to it, and the US Environmental Protection Agency <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to approve it for indoor use. Boric acid, occasionally applied as a safe indoor insecticide, is not effective against bed bugs {{because they do not}} groom. The fungus Beauveria bassiana is being researched [...] for its ability to control bed bugs. As bed bugs continue to adapt pesticide resistance, researchers have examined the insect's genome to see how its adaptations develop and to look for potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited in its growth and development phases.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{actually}} several different legal doctrines {{at work in}} this case. [...] First, the case was decided under United States Supreme Court takings jurisprudence. [...] The plurality looked to the factors enunciated in Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City {{to determine if the}} enacted legislation functioned to deprive Eastern Enterprises of property without just compensation. [...] Since Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, the factors enunciated by Justice Brennan therein have been used to determine when a regulation rises {{to the level of a}} taking thereby requiring just compensation under the Fifth Amendment. [...] Second, since Lochner v. New York the Court <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to find on due process grounds that economic regulation was beyond the power of Congress. [...] Third, the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 was passed to remedy the insolvent pension plans of the coal mining labors which had been in place since the 1950s. [...] Fourth, and perhaps not independent, the Court examined the ex post facto nature of the effect of the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 on Eastern. [...] The majority examined such under its Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City analysis while the concurrence and the dissents actually looked at it as a distinct basis to hold the Congressional Act unconstitutional.|$|E
