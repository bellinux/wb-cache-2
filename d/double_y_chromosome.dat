Thus, although a male may have a well adapted <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> free of excessive mutation, it may never make it in to the next gene pool.

The <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> of the human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae appears to be involved in sex determination although very little is known about both its structure and function. The work described in this thesis led to the characterization of an Anopheles gambiae transgenic strain obtained by transposase-mediated integration of a transgene construct onto the <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome.</b> Using meganuclease-induced homologous repair a site-specific recombination signal was introduced onto the <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> and the resulting docking line, named YAttP, was proven to allow secondary integration. To demonstrate its utility, the activity of a germline-specific promoter when located on the <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> was studied. Anopheles arabiensis is another important vector of human malaria. Since active insertions onto the <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> are extremely rare, a scheme based on crossing and selection was used to overcome F 1 hybrid male sterility and introgress the modified Anopheles gambiae <b>Y</b> <b>chromosome</b> in the Anopheles arabiensis genetic background.
