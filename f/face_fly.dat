40|$|BACKGROUND: Faceflies, Musca autumnalis DeGeer (Diptera: Muscidae),and houseflies, Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae), have a {{significant}} impact on livestock and dairy production throughout North America. Pyrethroid insecticide efficacy can be affected by exposure to direct sunlight, and the rate of photodegradation is substrate and formulation dependent. Insecticidetreated netting (ITN) is finding new applications in crop and livestock production systems. A baseline study using long-duration no-choice assays has been carried out to gauge the effectiveness of ITN treated with β-cyfluthrin, λ-cyhalothrin and bifenthrin on <b>face</b> <b>flies</b> and houseflies. RESULTS: After 12 weeks in direct sunlight, ITN treated with β-cyfluthrin was still highly insecticidal to <b>face</b> <b>flies</b> and houseflies, producing 100 % mortality in petri dish assays. However, sunlight reduced the insecticidal activity of λ-cyhalothrin, with 3 % of <b>face</b> <b>flies</b> and 50 % of houseflies surviving after exposure to ITN that had been deployed for 10 weeks. Insecticidal activity was greatly reduced on bifenthrin-treated netting, with 20 % of <b>face</b> <b>flies</b> and 50 % of houseflies surviving in assays with netting deployed for only 3 weeks. CONCLUSION: With careful choice of the pyrethroid applied, treated netting could be an important component of livestock integrated pest management programs focused on sustainable practices...|$|R

50|$|Musca is a genus of flies. It {{includes}} Musca domestica (the common housefly), {{as well as}} Musca autumnalis (the <b>face</b> <b>fly</b> or autumn housefly). It is part of {{the family}} Muscidae.|$|E
50|$|The <b>face</b> <b>fly</b> {{is similar}} to the closely related house fly. Slightly larger, {{averaging}} about 7 - 8 mm long and grey in colour with four dark stripes on the thorax, with a grey-black patterned abdomen. Like many true flies, in the males, the eyes almost touch when viewed from above.|$|E
50|$|These beetles live in cow dung. The adults {{feed on the}} dung {{and other}} organic matter, but the beetle larvae are predators of the maggots of the flies that breed in the dung, such as the <b>face</b> <b>fly</b> (Musca autumnalis). Two or more Sphaeridium beetle species may coexist in one pat, and the larvae may feed on each other. The female beetle {{deposits}} several eggs encased in a cocoon.|$|E

40|$|NYS IPM Type: Project ReportThis project {{seeks to}} advance a reliable, effective, non-pesticidal, {{alternative}} pasture fly management technology for producers {{through the development}} of a <b>face</b> <b>fly</b> parasitoid readily adaptable to commercial production. This information will be used as the first brick in the foundation of a pasture-fly IPM program. Currently, there are no commercial sources of beneficial organisms for pasture fly management. The absence of such a control agent is a limiting factor in the pasture-based IPM and it is therefore critical that this study be performed. Our ultimate goals with A. tristis are to be able to enhance opportunities for both on-pasture, as well as, commercial rearing of this beneficial species and to promote implementation with stakeholders. This study sought to develop effective rearing techniques for the indigenous staphylinid beetle parasitoid Aleochara tristis, a potentially significant biological control agent of the economically important <b>face</b> <b>fly.</b> A. tristis was successfully reared on house fly eggs (adult beetles) and live <b>face</b> <b>fly</b> pupae. House fly pupae (neither live nor frozen-then-thawed) were not utilized by A. tristis in choice and no-choice studies for immature beetle development. Crushed house fly pupae (live or frozen) were not utilized as an adult food. Occasionally, adult beetles had difficulty emerging from <b>face</b> <b>fly</b> puparia. As described below, a fungal infection caused the loss of the colony {{at a time when we}} were unable to begin anew. We plan to continue our research with A. tristis in 2004 and build upon the valuable lessons learned this past summer...|$|E

40|$|Six day old <b>face</b> <b>fly</b> pupae, one {{day before}} emergence, were {{irradiated}} in a nitrogenous atmosphere using gamma radiation from a cobalt 60 source. Six levels of gamma radiation were used: 0, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 rads. The effects of gamma radiation on eclosion, reproduction, and male longevity and competitiveness were determined. Female mating habits under laboratory conditions were also examined;Irradiation under anoxic conditions did not adversely affect adult eclosion, female fecundity or male competitiveness. Sterility in treated males and females increased as radiation dosage increased. A dose of 2500 rads reduced fertility of males to less than 1 % and produced similar results in the females. Longevity of treated males was not affected by increasing radiation dose up to 2000 rads. However, males receiving 2500 rads died sooner than unirradiated males.

40|$|A {{standardized}} bioassay {{using the}} <b>face</b> <b>fly,</b> Musca autumnalis L (Diptera: Muscidae), {{was developed to}} test the lethal and sublethal toxicity of parasiticide residues in livestock dung. The repeatability of this test was assessed for the parasiticide ivermectin in seven tests performed in four laboratories in Germany and France. Additional results of limit tests were provided by two laboratories from the UK. Test results had an acceptable range of heterogeneity. The calculated effect concentration at which 50 % emergence was observed (EC 50) averaged 4. 65 +/- 2. 17 (Standard Deviation (SD) mu g ivermectin/kg fresh dung (range: 1. 20 - 7. 7)). Effects on emergence were, with one exception, not observed below the No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) ranging between 1. 11 and 3. 33 mu g ivermectin/kg. No effect on development time was observed. We conclude that the <b>face</b> <b>fly</b> is suitably sensitive, and the methods sufficiently repeatable, to support use of this standardized bioassay {{by the international community}} in the registration of new veterinary pharmaceuticals. Following these considerations, this species was accepted as a possible test organism in a recently published OECD Guideline (No. 228). (c) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Declining {{dairy cow}} fertility, largely {{attributable}} to increasing milk yields, is of major concern to dairy farmers worldwide. New tools for reproductive management, to replace exogenous hormones, {{would be of}} great interest. Chemical communication in cattle has been suggested to cause modifications of the oestrous cycle. Here, reproductive parameters were monitored in ten dairy heifers during five oestrous cycles. They were exposed to distilled water (control) or oestrous urine and vaginal mucus (treatment). Four of them were also subjected to intensive blood sampling to study the treatment effect on the LH pulsatility pattern (LHP) preceding the preovulatory LH surge (LHS). We found that the treatment had significant effects on when the different signs of oestrus occurred and on the intensity of oestrus expression. There was a tendency for treatment {{to have an effect}} on LHS characteristics whereas LHP was significantly affected by the treatment. To find a quick bioassay to detect bioactive bovine body fluids, two heifers and two bulls were exposed to different body fluids while their heart rates were registered. Although the exposure caused significant effects, they were not of sufficient magnitude to be useful. Further attempts to find a bioassay to identify oestrus-specific compounds included using the <b>face</b> <b>fly</b> as a biological detector. Female flies were allowed to choose between either oestrous (OU) or luteal urine (LU) and distilled water (control) in a Y-tube olfactometer. Flies were significantly repelled by OU, but not by LU. Gas chromatography coupled with electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) revealed no behaviourally active, oestrusspecific compounds. Comparison of chromatograms, however, showed that cetyl alcohol was more abundant in OU than in LU. When tested at different doses, the lowest dose of cetyl alcohol was found to attract flies, while the second lowest dose was repellent. We found effects of exposure to body fluids on cyclicity in heifers, as well as on heart rate in cattle, which supports the existence of bovine pheromones. We also found that the <b>face</b> <b>fly</b> could discriminate between OU and LU, probably based on the amount of cetyl alcohol in the samples. Neither monitoring of heart rate, nor using the <b>face</b> <b>fly</b> as a biological detector, were suitable bioassays for detection of bovine pheromones. ...|$|E
40|$|Dustacators (combination mineral feeders and {{livestock}} dusting devices) {{were used for}} four beef herds at Kansas State University in 1985. Loose mineral was supplied in all four Dustacator tubs, which were adjusted to low settings. Permethrin dust had no apparent effect on horn flies. Co-Ral® from two sources and Rabon® provided approximately 65 % horn fly reduction during the 53 -day test period. The 1986 experiment compared the effects of Dustacator mineral tub height adjustments and loose vs. block mineral. Co-Hal 1 % dust from a single source was used in all treatments on two Simmental herds and two Polled Hereford herds. Excellent horn fly control was achieved and maintained except for a temporary increase in horn fly numbers in early September in all treatments. <b>Face</b> <b>fly</b> control was inadequate in all treatments in both years. Use of block mineral was related to reduced mineral consumption and self-application of more insecticide dust. High tub adjustment was related to greater mineral consumption but reduced self-application of insecticide. The degree of fly control was not correlated with amount of insecticide used either on a per-cow or per-herd basis. Simmentals consumed nearly twice as much mineral per head as Polled Herefords, but they used only 20 % more insecticide.
