60|$|Sir William stood naively {{before the}} mirror {{and looked at his}} three stars on his black velvet <b>dinner-jacket.</b>|$|E
60|$|John {{met her at}} {{the foot}} of the stairs. She noticed with some {{surprise}} that he was wearing the <b>dinner-jacket</b> and black tie of civilization.|$|E
6000|$|... "And it goes just here--the {{level of}} the heart. This is where it goes." [...] And {{carefully}} he pinned the large, radiating ornament on the black velvet <b>dinner-jacket</b> of the old man.|$|E
6000|$|As to Ainslie, he's {{not caring}} [...] How the new-cut collar lies, [...] And has been {{detected}} wearing [...] <b>Dinner-jackets</b> with white ties.|$|R
60|$|Archie, {{following}} his friend's gaze, understood. Reggie van Tuyl was never at his strongest in the morning, {{and he had}} a sensitive eye for clothes. He had been known to resign from clubs because members exceeded the bounds in the matter of soft shirts with <b>dinner-jackets.</b> And the short, thick-set man who was standing just in front of them in attitude of restful immobility was certainly no dandy. His best friend could not have called him dapper. Take him for all in all and on the hoof, he might have been posing as a model for a sketch of What the Well-Dressed Man Should Not Wear.|$|R
50|$|Stephen Gaselee {{was already}} {{at the age of}} twenty what he never ceased to be, a Cambridge Personality; Gaselee, with almost as many friends as interests, a {{first-class}} classical scholar, a bibliophile, a bibliographer, a liturgiologist; Gaselee, who when playing tennis wore his hair in a net; who kept Siamese cats, fed with a revolting portion of cow’s lung preserved on a plate above his bookshelf; who had a fire every day in the year because England has a cold climate; who founded the Deipnosophists’ dining club, where the members, robed in purple <b>dinner-jackets</b> lined with lilac silk and preluding dashingly on Vodka, would launch forth into an uncharted ocean of good food and even better talk; Gaselee, who read, wrote and spoke Ancient Coptic (which the Copts themselves had not done for 300 years); Gaselee, nightly puffing his long churchwarden whilst he expatiated on Petronius, vestments, Shark’s Fin and cooking problems; a lay Prince of the Church, Ecclesiastic Militant and Gastronomer Royal.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right, my boy. A <b>dinner-jacket</b> is {{perfectly}} in order. We shall {{be quite a}} small party. Six in all. You and I, {{a friend of mine}} and his daughter, a friend of my friend's friend and my friend's friend's son." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (He inhales a {{deep breath}} of air. Then looking at his <b>dinner-jacket</b> he begins {{brushing}} at it with his hand. A lamentable figure creeps in from the left. It is ALBERTO. If he had a tail, it would be trailing on the ground between his legs.) ...|$|E
60|$|I {{gathered}} {{that this}} was Mrs. Jane Jukes Jopp, the wife who had divorced him for systematic and ingrowing fiendishness {{on the ground that}} he had repeatedly outraged her feelings by wearing a white waistcoat with a <b>dinner-jacket.</b> She continued to look at him dumbly, and then uttered a sort of strangled, hysterical laugh.|$|E
60|$|I {{went and}} dressed sadly. It {{will show you}} pretty well how pipped I was when I tell you that I near as a toucher put on a white tie with a <b>dinner-jacket.</b> I sallied out {{for a bit of}} food more to pass the time than because I wanted it. It seemed brutal to be wading into the bill of fare with poor old Bicky headed for the breadline.|$|E
60|$|He {{went back}} to his room and {{finished}} fastening his tie. His own affairs had sunk a little into the background lately, but the announcement of this unusual visitor brought them back into his mind with a rush. Notwithstanding his iron nerves, his fingers shook as he drew on his <b>dinner-jacket</b> and walked out to the passageway to answer the bell which rang a few seconds later. A man stood outside, dressed in shabby black clothes, whose face somehow was familiar to him, although he could not, for the moment, place it.|$|E
60|$|Burton came quickly in. He was paler, even, than usual, {{and there}} were black shadows under his eyes. There was a change in his face, indescribable but very apparent. His eyes had lost their dreamy look, he glanced furtively about him, he had {{the air of a}} man who has {{committed}} a crime and fears detection. His dress was not nearly so neat as usual. Mr. Waddington, whose bachelor evening clothes--a loose <b>dinner-jacket</b> and carefully tied black tie--were exactly as they should be, glanced disparagingly at his visitor.|$|E
60|$|She {{studied him}} and Jake while {{she talked to}} Mrs. Winter. Jim seldom wore {{conventional}} evening clothes, but he had put on an American <b>dinner-jacket.</b> He and his comrade were strangely agile; their movements were quick, their step was light, like a cat's, and she noted how they lifted their feet. She {{did not know the}} prospector gets the habit by walking through tangled bush and across rough stones. They had a suppleness that came from using the long ax, and toil in the wilds had given them a fine-drawn look. In some ways both were modern, but in some they belonged to the past, when the fortress peels were built and the marsh-men fought the Scots.|$|E
6000|$|You! With your warm, full, rich, red, ripe lips, And your beautifully manicured finger-tips! [...] You! With your heaving, panting, rapidly {{expanding}} and [...] contracting chest, Lying against my perfectly ordinary shirt-front and [...] <b>dinner-jacket</b> vest. [...] It {{is too much}} [...] Your touch [...] As such. [...] It and [...] Your hand, [...] Can you not understand? Last night an ostrich feather from your fragrant hair [...] Unnoticed fell. [...] I guard it [...] Well. [...] Yestere'en [...] From your tiara I have slid, [...] Unseen, [...] A single diamond, [...] And I keep it [...] Hid. Last night you left inside the vestibule upon the sill [...] A quarter dollar, [...] And I have it [...] Still.|$|E
60|$|For a {{few moments}} they hesitated, {{standing}} in the strong illumination of the lamp on Mordaunt's car that picked out their faces against the dark. Jake wore an American <b>dinner-jacket,</b> Carrie a thin evening dress, {{and she had no}} hat. Dick noted that her hands were clenched and her mouth worked. She had, of course, got a shock; Winter ought not to have let her see Jim, but the keenness of her distress was significant. Dick, however, could not dwell on this just then. They must get Jim out and {{it was going to be}} difficult. The car rested insecurely on the edge of the bank and the broken branches of the thorns. If they disturbed it rashly, it might slip down and crush the unconscious man. Mordaunt was the first to see a way and jumped into the ditch.|$|E
60|$|He {{was told}} various names: bowed to a young, slim woman with big {{blue eyes and}} dark hair like a photograph, then to a smaller rather {{colourless}} {{young woman with a}} large nose: then to a stout, rubicund, bald colonel, and to a tall, thin, Oxford-looking major with a black patch over his eye--both these men in khaki: finally to a good-looking, well-nourished young man in a <b>dinner-jacket,</b> and he sat down to his soup, on his hostess' left hand. The colonel sat on her right, and was confidential. Little Sir William, with his hair and his beard white like spun glass, his manner very courteous and animated, the purple facings of his velvet jacket very impressive, sat {{at the far end of}} the table jesting with the ladies and showing his teeth in an old man's smile, a little bit affected, but pleasant, wishing everybody to be happy.|$|E
6000|$|Annette {{was in the}} drawing-room, {{dressed for}} dinner, and {{he thought as he}} went up-stairs 'Handsome is as {{handsome}} does.' Handsome! Except for remarks about the curtains in the drawing-room, and the storm, there was practically no conversation during a meal distinguished by exactitude of quantity and perfection of quality. Soames drank nothing. He followed her into the drawing-room afterward, and found her smoking a cigarette on the sofa between the two French windows. She was leaning back, almost upright, in a low black frock, with her knees crossed and her blue eyes half-closed; grey-blue smoke issued from her red, rather full lips, a fillet bound her chestnut hair, she wore the thinnest silk stockings, and shoes with very high heels showing off her instep. A fine piece in any room! Soames, who held that torn letter in a hand thrust deep into the side-pocket of his <b>dinner-jacket,</b> said: ...|$|E
60|$|Five minutes later--at 7.45 to be precise--we four {{sat down}} to such a dinner as, I hold, only The Infant's cook can produce, with wines worthy of pontifical banquets. A man in the {{extremity}} of rage and injured dignity is precisely like a typhoid patient. He asks no questions, accepts what is put before him, and babbles in one key--very often of trifles. But food and drink are {{the very best of}} drugs. I think it was Heidsieck Dry Monopole '92--Stalky as usual stuck to Burgundy--that began to unlock Mr. Wontner's heart behind my shirt-front. Me he snubbed throughout, after the Oxford manner, because I had seen him in the sack, and he did not intend me to presume; but to Stalky and The Infant, while I admired the set of my <b>dinner-jacket</b> across his shoulders, he made his plans of revenge very clear indeed. He had even sketched out some of the paragraphs that were to appear in the papers, and if Stalky had allowed me to speak, I would have told him that they were rather neatly phrased.|$|E
6000|$|... "Same time," [...] said Babbitt, [...] "no sense excusing these rube burgs too easy. Fellow's {{own fault}} if he doesn't show the {{initiative}} to up and beat it to the city, like we done--did. And, just speaking in confidence among friends, they're jealous as the devil of a city man. Every time I go up to Catawba I have to go around apologizing to the fellows I was brought up with because I've more or less succeeded and they haven't. And if you talk natural to 'em, way we do here, and show finesse and {{what you might call}} a broad point of view, why, they think you're putting on side. There's my own half-brother Martin--runs the little ole general store my Dad used to keep. Say, I'll bet he don't know {{there is such a thing}} as a Tux--as a <b>dinner-jacket.</b> If he was to come in here now, he'd think we were a bunch of--of--Why, gosh, I swear, he wouldn't know what to think! Yes, sir, they're jealous!" ...|$|E
60|$|It was not {{a subject}} they could discuss at dinner--consecrated to the susceptibilities of the butler. The agony of nerves Soames had been through, the relief he felt at her safety, {{softened}} his power to condemn what she had done, or resist {{what she was going}} to do; he waited in a relaxed stupor for her revelation. Life was a queer business. There he was at sixty-five and no more in command of things than if he had not spent forty years in building up security--always something one couldn't get on terms with! In the pocket of his <b>dinner-jacket</b> was a letter from Annette. She was coming back in a fortnight. He knew nothing of what she had been doing out there. And he was glad that he did not. Her absence had been a relief. Out of sight was out of mind! And now she was coming back. Another worry! And the Bolderby Old Crome was gone--Dumetrius had got it--all because that anonymous letter had put it out of his thoughts. He furtively remarked the strained look on his daughter's face, as if she too were gazing at a picture that she couldn't buy. He almost wished the war back. Worries didn't seem, then, quite so worrying. From the caress in her voice, the look on her face, he became certain that she wanted something from him, uncertain whether it would be wise of him to give it her. He pushed his savoury away uneaten, and even joined her in a cigarette.|$|E
6000|$|Without doubt {{good form}} {{had become a}} kind of disease in England. A French friend told me how he {{witnessed}} in a Swiss Hotel the meeting between an Englishwoman and her son, whom she had not seen for two years; she was greatly affected--by {{the fact that he had}} not brought a <b>dinner-jacket.</b> The best manners are no [...] "manners," [...] or at all events no mannerisms; but many Britons who have even attained to this perfect purity are yet not free from the paralytic effects of [...] "good form"; are still self-conscious in the depths of their souls, and never do or say a thing without trying not to show what they are feeling. All this guarantees a certain decency in life; but in intimate intercourse with people of other nations who have not this particular cult of suppression, we English disappoint, and jar, and often irritate. Nations have their differing forms of snobbery. At one time the English all wanted to be second cousins to the Earl of Leitrim, like that lady bland and passionate. Nowadays it is not so simple. The Earl of Leitrim has become etherealised. We no longer care how a fellow is born so long as he behaves as the Earl of Leitrim would have, never makes himself conspicuous or ridiculous, never shows too much what he's really feeling, never talks of what he's going to do, and always [...] "plays the game." [...] The cult is centred in our public schools and universities.|$|E
5000|$|Nobody {{who saw him}} is ever {{likely to}} forget that rubicund, unaesthetic countenance, that black, {{plastered}} quiff, that sergeant-major's moustache, that dreadfull <b>dinner-jacket,</b> that well-used dickey and seedy collar, the too-short trousers, the hob-nailed boots, the red silk handkerchief tucked into the waistcoat, the continual perspiration which was the outward and visible sign of a mind struggling for expression - these things will not be forgotten.|$|E
50|$|Peter Denniston {{proposes to}} Sheila Wallace; {{he knew her}} four years ago, and has a job in Hong Kong with his uncle, as a {{maritime}} solicitor. He drops in on the Wallaces while supposedly on a walking tour, but as Jimmie Wallace says: Whoever heard of a man taking a <b>dinner-jacket</b> {{with him on a}} walking tour?. She turns him down, saying she could not live in China. So Denniston returns to London for a week solo on the yacht Irene that he shares with Lanard.|$|E
50|$|From {{that study}} we {{staggered}} with our arms full of books, Wells and Hemingway, Milton and Dr Johnson, Henry James and George Moore, our minds fired by his enthusiasm and wise advice, our shoulders tingling from the squeeze of his mighty {{hand as he}} guided us through the bookshelves. We think of him... majestically immobile as he umpired in the Field, {{and he was the}} best of them all in ruling the game and in writing about it afterwards; or... those brilliant expositions of the reading or writing of English where he achieved the perfect artistry of teaching; or at his Old Boy dinners, enveloped in a vast and aging <b>dinner-jacket,</b> delivering with commendable timing a string of improbable stories about his large family or the more obscure annals of Suffolk agricultural life.|$|E
