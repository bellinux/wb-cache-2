Nokia subsequently entered into a long-term licensing deal to make HMD the exclusive manufacturer of Nokia-branded phones and tablets outside of Japan, operating in conjunction with Foxconn. The deal also granted HMD the right to essential patents and feature phone software. HMD subsequently announced the Android-based Nokia 6 smartphone in January 2017. At Mobile World Congress, HMD additionally unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, {{as well as a}} re-imagining of Nokia's classic 3310 feature phone.

25|$|Despite {{being made}} from the same grape and {{produced}} in neighboring areas less than 10 miles from each other, the wines of Barbaresco and Barolo <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> distinct differences. Located south of the river Tanaro, the Barbaresco zone receives a slight maritime influence which allows Nebbiolo to ripen here a little earlier than {{it does in the}} Barolo zone. This allows the grape to get to fermentation earlier with a shorter maceration time. The early tannins in a young Barbaresco are not quite as harsh as Barolo and under DOCG rules it is allowed to age for a year less than Barolo. The Barolo wines that tend to be closer in body, fruitiness, and perfume to Barbaresco wines are generally the ones produced near the villages of La Morra and Barolo. The most pronounced difference between the two wines is that the tannins of Barbaresco tend to soften quicker, which can make the wines more approachable to drink at an earlier age but won't allow it to age for as long as a traditionally made Barolo could. The smaller vineyard areas mean that annual production of Barbaresco is around 35% the production of Barolo and therefore the wines are not as widely available out on the market. However, the smaller area does generally produce more consistent profiles among the Barbarescos than across the more expansive Barolo zone.|$|E

Abu Nidal reportedly said of Lockerbie, according to Seale: [...] "We <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> involvement in this matter, but if anyone so much as mentions it, I will kill him with my own hands!"

500|$|A 2012 phylogenetic study built {{a family}} tree down to genus level using 20,000 species {{to compare the}} {{medicinal}} plants of three regions, Nepal, New Zealand and the South African Cape. It discovered that the species used traditionally to treat {{the same types of}} condition belonged to the same groups of plants in all three regions, giving a [...] "strong phylogenetic signal". Since many plants that yield pharmaceutical drugs belong to just these groups, and the groups were independently used in three different regions, the results were taken to mean firstly that these plant groups <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> medicinal efficacy, secondly that pharmacological activity is associated with use in traditional medicine, and thirdly that the use of a phylogenetic groups for medicines in one region predicts their use in the other regions.|$|E
500|$|Younger or {{subdominant}} male pinnipeds may {{attempt to}} achieve reproductive success in other ways. Subadult elephant seals will sneak into female clusters {{and try to}} blend in by pulling in their noses. They also harass and attempt to mate with females that head out to the water. In otariid species like the South American and Australian sea lions, non-territorial subadults form [...] "gangs" [...] and cause chaos within the breeding rookeries to increase their chances of mating with females. Alternative mating strategies also exist in young male grey seals, which <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> success. Female pinnipeds do appear to have some choice in mates, particularly in lek-breeding species like the walrus, but also in elephant seals where the males try to dominate all the females {{that they want to}} mate with. When a female elephant seal or grey seal is mounted by an unwanted male, she tries to squirm and get away, while croaking and slapping him with her tail. This commotion attracts other males to the scene, and the most dominant will end the copulation and attempt to mate with the female himself. Dominant female elephant seals stay {{in the center of the}} colony where they are more likely to mate with a dominant male, while peripheral females are more likely to mate with subordinates. Female Steller sea lions are known to solicit mating with their territorial males.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} H5N1 {{vaccines}} for {{several of the}} avian H5N1 varieties, but the continual mutation of H5N1 renders them of limited use to date: while vaccines can sometimes provide cross-protection against related flu strains, the best protection would be from a vaccine specifically produced for any future pandemic flu virus strain. Dr. Daniel Lucey, co-director of the Biohazardous Threats and Emerging Diseases graduate program at Georgetown University has made this point, [...] "There is no H5N1 pandemic so {{there can be no}} pandemic vaccine". However, [...] "pre-pandemic vaccines" [...] have been created; are being refined and tested; and <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> promise both in furthering research and preparedness for the next pandemic.
