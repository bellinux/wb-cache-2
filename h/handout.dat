If approved by the Parliament, the government will pay an extra cash <b>handout</b> of 280,000 rials/month to 80% of the general population (i.e. people earning less than $2000/month, which is a comfortable income level in Iran). In July 2012, it was announced that implementation of the second phase was suspended awaiting further adjustments by the government and because of raising inflation (around 22% as of April 2012). Finally, in fall 2013, the parliament approved a plan to drop 22 million Iranians—the top 30 percent of earners—from the subsidy system instead. Yet, it was reported in 2014 that out of Iran’s population of 77 million, 73.6 million registered to receive the cash hand-outs.|$|E

It is now a common practice to supply PowerPoint <b>handouts</b> and publish lecture <b>handouts</b> on the web for students’ access. A study was conducted among the first year medical students (n= 142) of School of Medical Sciences (SMS), Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) {{in order to determine}} their perceptions and expectations with regards to lecture <b>handouts</b> provided to them. The majority of the students reported that they read the lecture <b>handouts</b> as a reference and found them useful as a guide for future learning. More than half (68 %) of the students expressed dissatisfaction with the overall presentation format of the <b>handouts</b> which is mainly technology-related i. e. PowerPoint and photocopying. This study indicated that students’ expectations and experiences were positive towards the use of <b>handouts.</b> They used <b>handouts</b> as a means of supplementing rather than substituting their learning. Much care is needed when educators supply computer-based <b>handouts,</b> as this study shows a number of limitations when students use them. Medical schools should consider publishing web-based <b>handouts</b> with online and other facilities to make it interesting and effective...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Note taking while {{attending}} a PPT requires high activity {{of memory and}} writing process which ultimately leads to what is called “death by power point” referring to boredom and fatigue. To overcome this we planned to evaluate the impact of utilisation of uncompleted <b>handouts</b> given prior to PPT presentations. Methods: Final year MBBS students were divided in 2 batches, batch A and batch B. For a set of lectures one batch was provided with <b>handouts</b> before lecture while the other batch was given lectures only. Crossover was done to avoid bias, all the lectures being given by the same presenter. At {{the end of each}} lecture, a short questionnaire of 10 Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) was provided to the students. Mean scores were calculated for lectures with <b>handouts</b> and without <b>handouts.</b> Results: For a set of lectures, when batch A was provided with <b>handouts,</b> the mean score was 28. 2; for batch B to which no <b>handouts</b> were given the mean score was 23. 4. Similarly, for batch B when provided with <b>handouts</b> the mean score was 29. 1, for batch A which was not provided with <b>handouts</b> the mean score was 24. There was an average increase of 4. 2 marks. Actual gain when <b>handouts</b> were provided was 1. 2 marks per lecture. It was more for the batch comprising of repeater students as compared to the batch of fresher students. Increase in attendance was also noted. Conclusion: Providing uncompleted <b>handouts</b> before a didactic lecture definitely results in increase in knowledge gain; repeater students benefit more with uncompleted <b>handouts...</b>|$|R

Hennessey said that he overheard people in the group saying that the point of their strategy was to make sure that Carter, whose book, Palestine Peace Not Apartheid, faced only tough questions.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to combat the influx of Kolpak players, the ECB linked the central {{payments}} made to counties, {{to the number of}} English qualified players who play for that county. This in effect means that every game a Kolpak player plays instead of an English qualified player, a county gets £1,100 less from the ECB. As this was classed as a way of encouraging counties to develop young players who could go on to play for England, rather than a restrictive quota system, it was legal under the EU rules. However, the system did not result in a significant drop in the number of Kolpak players, as counties chose to continue to sign foreign players, rather than maximize their <b>handout</b> from the ECB. The influx reached a peak in 2008, when during a match between Northants and Leicestershire, half the players on the field were from non-EU countries.|$|E

2500|$|References to a {{dividing}} line between metals and nonmetals appear in the literature {{as far back as}} at least 1869. In 1891, Walker published a periodic 'tabulation' with a diagonal straight line drawn between the metals and the nonmetals. In 1906, Alexander Smith published a periodic table with a zigzag line separating the nonmetals from the rest of elements, in his highly influential textbook Introduction to General Inorganic Chemistry. In 1923, Horace G. Deming, an American chemist, published short (...) and medium (...) form periodic tables. Each one had a regular stepped line separating metals from nonmetals. Merck and Company prepared a <b>handout</b> form of Deming's 18-column table, in 1928, which was widely circulated in American schools.

In a workshop <b>handout</b> prepared by two therapists at The Center, the following sequence of events is described: (1) therapist 'forces control' by holding (which produces child 'rage'); (2) rage leads to child 'capitulation' to the therapist, {{as indicated by the}} child breaking down emotionally ('sobbing'); (3) the therapist takes advantage of the child's capitulation by showing nurturance and warmth; (4) this new trust allows the child to accept 'control' by the therapist and eventually the parent. According to The Center's treatment protocol, if the child 'shuts down' (i.e., refuses to comply), he or she may be threatened with detainment for the day at the clinic or forced placement in a temporary foster home; this is explained to the child as a consequence of not choosing to be a 'family boy or girl.' If the child is actually placed in foster care, the child is then required to 'earn the way back to therapy' and a chance to resume living with the adoptive family." ...|$|E

[...] At the time welfare caseloads climbed 36 percent from 1988 while one out of twelve Virginians were receiving food stamps.

An {{important}} aspect of the use of a <b>handout</b> is that a person can keep a <b>handout</b> with them long after the presentation is over.

Once a <b>handout</b> is given out, it might potentially be difficult to bring back your audience’s attention.
