5|$|A {{group of}} {{anomalous}} units, as mentioned above, {{had not been}} transferred into the new system; these were the two Irish Yeomanry regiments and the Volunteers of Bermuda and the <b>Isle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Man.</b> The decision had been taken to have no Territorial Force units in Ireland and so the two yeomanry regiments were disbanded and reconstituted in the Special Reserve as the North Irish Horse and South Irish Horse. The <b>Isle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Man</b> Volunteers and Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps remained organised as Volunteers; whilst the new legislation did extend to the <b>Isle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Man,</b> the force was not reorganised there {{partly due to the}} difficulty of changing to annual training. Bermuda, the Channel Islands and Malta were not encompassed by the scope of the legislation, and so the Militia there continued to operate under the old system.|$|E

Depositors with Landsbanki on Guernsey found themselves without any depositor protection.|$|E

60|$|So {{this scene}} of barbarity and sentimentalism passed off, leaving behind strange and incongruous impressions. True, every one was perhaps glad when silence succeeded that all too {{appropriate}} music; true, Mac's apology and subsequent behaviour rather raised {{him in the}} opinion of his fellow-castaways. But the discordant note had been struck, and its harmonics tingled in the brain. In that savage, houseless <b>isle,</b> the passions <b>of</b> <b>man</b> had sounded, if only for the moment, and all men trembled at the possibilities of horror.|$|R

60|$|While {{on our way}} up we came to {{an object}} which filled us with much interest. This was the stump of a tree that had evidently been cut down with an axe! So, then, we were not the first who had viewed this {{beautiful}} <b>isle.</b> The hand <b>of</b> <b>man</b> had been at work there before us. It now began to recur to us again that perhaps the island was inhabited, although we had not seen any traces <b>of</b> <b>man</b> until now. But a second glance at the stump convinced us that we had not more reason to think so now than formerly; for {{the surface of the}} wood was quite decayed and partly covered with fungus and green matter, so that it must have been cut many years ago.|$|R
50|$|David Moore married Ida Shaw in 1957, {{with whom}} he had two sons; Wayne, born in 1961, and Lloyd, born in 1969. Upon {{returning}} from the USA in 1961, David and Ida resided in Leicester, until 1969, when they moved to Reading. Following his retirement, David Moore continued to travel widely, often accompanied by Ida, and counted the USA, Spain and The <b>Isles</b> <b>of</b> Wight and <b>Man</b> as personal favourites. He continued to support ex-colleagues and students at Reading University and further afield for many years, and remained a singularly erudite and compelling writer until late in life, {{with a wide range of}} opinions on current affairs. Later grandchildren expanded Moore's family further, comprising Alexander, Nicholas, Katherine, Adam and Rhianna, and whilst all benefited from his wisdom and knowledge, none show signs of emulating his prestigious career.|$|R

60|$|The Goddess of Wisdom, Athênê, {{had always}} favoured Ulysses, {{and now she}} spoke up among the Gods, where they sat, as men say, in their holy heaven. Not by winds is it shaken, nor wet with rain, nor does the snow come thither, but clear air is spread about it cloudless, and the white light floats over it. Athênê told how good, wise, and brave Ulysses was, {{and how he was}} kept in the <b>isle</b> <b>of</b> Calypso, while <b>men</b> ruined his wealth and wooed his wife. She said that she would herself go to Ithaca, and make Telemachus appeal to all the people of the country, showing how evilly he was treated, and then sail abroad to seek news of his father. So Athênê spoke, and flashed down from Olympus to Ithaca, where she took the shape <b>of</b> a mortal <b>man,</b> Mentes, a chief of the Taphians. In front of the doors she found the proud wooers playing at {{draughts}} and other games while supper was being made ready. When Telemachus, who was standing apart, saw the stranger, he went to him, and led him into the house, and treated him kindly, while the wooers ate and drank, and laughed noisily.|$|R
