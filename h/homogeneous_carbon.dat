30|$|Our {{detailed}} microscopic analyses can {{be summarized}} into the following consistent picture {{on the effect of}} <b>homogeneous</b> <b>carbon</b> doping during the wire heat treatment process: Magnesium vapor permeates into carbon-shielded boron and forms nanocrystalline MgB 2 seeds. As these seeds grow further, grains merge together, carbon is extruded outside MgB 2 phases, and a small amount of remaining carbon causes lots of defects. Carbon also prevents boron agglomeration, resulting in a dense wire core. Already, the critical current density at low field is comparable to Nb-Ti, and we expect that further optimization can lead the un-reacted boron phase into a fully reacted MgB 2 phase while maintaining its small grain size and a drastic increase in the critical current density far beyond Nb-Ti can be realized.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{order to}} {{understand}} the physical processes determining the dynamical structure and behaviour of circumstellar dust shells (CDS) around long [...] period variables (LPVs), it is inevitable to take consistently into account the complex interplay among dust formation, hydrodynamics, chemistry, and thermodynamics. Since the dust component, due to its huge absorption cross section with respect to the stellar radiation field, plays a decisive role for the structure and dynamics of the circumstellar shell, a proper description of formation and growth of the dust grains is a necessary prerequisite to model the CDS around LPVs. In contrast to the carbon [...] rich situation, where mainly <b>homogeneous</b> amorphous <b>carbon</b> grains are formed (Gail & Sedlmayr 1988), in an oxygen [...] rich environment almost all carbon is locked up in the chemically inert CO molecule.

This is a good indication that three dimensional (3 D) percolation network structures among carbon nanotubes (single wall and multi wall) {{play a crucial role in}} stabilization. To better understand this assumption and provide further evidence, some additional carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon nanofiber (CNF), graphene, fullerene (C 60), Ni-coated single wall carbon nanotube (SWNT), are selected to make the grease. Unfortunately, CNF, graphene, fullerene (C 60) and Ni-coated SWNT do not form stable greases as nanotubes do. In addition, SWNTs were mixed with CNF and Ni-coated SWNT respectively to see if stable grease could be formed. The results indicate that the CNF/SWNT did not form the stable grease, while Ni-coated SWNT/SWNT did. Inter molecular Van der Waals forces could reasonably explain these experimental results. Appropriate tube size (nanotube and nanofiber), stereo structure (nanotube, graphene and fullerene), surface energy (nanotube and Ni-coated nanotube) are critical factors that determine if Van der Waals forces could take effect or not.
