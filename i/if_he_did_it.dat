25|$|A 15 {{year old}} Uyghur boy naked Burkhan {{rejected}} the idea of marrying a Han female and told Dr. Smith Finley {{that he would be}} totally shunned by his fellow Uyghurs <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> while a 20 year old Uyghur woman named Gülshäm said that she was open to marriage with Han, she cheered on mixed couples as courageous, condemning her fellow Uyghurs for their harsh opposition to intermarriage, after Gülshäm brought up the subject of dating a Han boyfriend with a female friend, her friend then threatened violence against her if she ever dated a Han.|$|E
25|$|Following Sitriuc's death, Amlaíb {{may have}} become king in York for a short time, but <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> {{came to an end}} when Æthelstan took over the kingdom of Northumbria and {{defeated}} Sitriuc's brother Gofraid. According to William of Malmesbury, Amlaíb fled to Ireland while his uncle Gofraid made a second unsuccessful attempt to gain control of York. In 937 an attack on Æthelstan's kingdom by Gofraid's son Amlaíb, assisted by Constantín mac Áeda, the king of Alba, and Owen, the king of Strathclyde, ended in defeat at the battle of Brunanburh. William of Malmesbury wrote that Amlaíb was present at Brunanburh and spied out the English camp the night before the battle disguised as a skald.|$|E
500|$|Young Frederick, Baron of Metzengerstein, was {{orphaned}} at a {{young age}} and, thus, inherited the family fortune at age 18 (though the age changes throughout its many re-publications). Equipped with enormous wealth and power, he begins to exhibit particularly cruel behavior. [...] "The behavior of the heir out-heroded Herod". Four days after he receives his inheritance, the stables of the rival family Berlifitzing catch fire. The neighborhood [...] "instantaneously" [...] attributed the act of arson to Frederick Metzengerstein (the story, however, does not say expressly <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> or not).|$|E

2500|$|... "If he {{will perform}} unto thee {{the part of}} a kinsman, well, let him do the kinsman's part": By marrying Ruth, and redeeming her husband's estate, which <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>it</b> would be all very well, and right {{according}} to law; and it would be very well for Ruth, as Aben Ezra and Abendana interpret it; seeing, as they observe, that kinsman was a very respectable man, a man of great esteem and worth, a man of wealth and authority, and she would be well matched to him. Some think, as the same writers observe, that the word [...] "Tob", translated [...] "well", {{is the name of the}} kinsman, the same with Tobias; so R. Joshuah says, that Salmon (who was the father of Boaz), and Elimelech (the father of Ruth's husband), and Tob (this near kinsman), were brethren.|$|E
2500|$|Thallus, of whom {{very little}} is known, and none of whose {{writings}} survive, wrote a history allegedly around the middle to late first century CE, to which Eusebius referred. Julius Africanus, writing c 221, links a reference in the third book of the History to the period of darkness described in the crucifixion accounts {{in three of the}} Gospels [...] It is not known whether Thallus made any mention to the crucifixion accounts; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>it</b> would be the earliest noncanonical reference to a gospel episode, but its usefulness in determining the historicity of Jesus is uncertain. The dating of Thallus is dependent on him writing about an event during the 207th Olympiad (49-52 AD), which means he wrote after that date, not near that date. This depends on the text being corrupt, which would mean Thallus could have been writing after the 217th Olympiad (89-92 AD), or even the 167th Olympiad (112-109 BC). He is first referenced by Theophilus, writing around 180 AD, which means Thallus could have written any time between 109 BC and 180 AD. [...] All we know is Thallus mentioned a solar eclipse, and as solar eclipses are not possible at Passover, that would mean Thallus was not talking about the crucifixion of Jesus at all.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, mother, {{he shall}} not {{come here to}} worry and insult you. I will give him fair warning now. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> again I'll pitch {{him out of the}} house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what you can do. Don't let your friend go to Mr. Broughton's house to paint the picture. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> there will {{mischief}} come of it. Of course you can prevent him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Mention what? Oh! {{about that}} woman, Mrs Hurtle? Indeed I shall. A {{man who does}} {{that kind of thing}} ought to be crushed;--and, by heavens, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> to you, <b>he</b> shall be crushed.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said he; [...] "but {{this is a}} {{suspicious}} world, and it is dangerous {{for a man to}} set himself apart from his fellow-beings, especially <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> in some unusual fashion which people cannot understand." ...|$|R

60|$|COLFORD. You {{may have}} my head <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> Lord St Erth. He and I {{have been in}} too many holes together. By Gad! My toe itches for that fellow's butt end.|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't it {{occur to}} you that if none of his fellow-servants were willing to help him black boots, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> only because he was obliged to, it was hardly the sort of work for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> {{any more}} I shall {{certainly}} {{let him know}} that I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So he will, but I'd bet ninety to one, {{it is not}} at that page, or <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>it</b> won't tell tales, unless, indeed, he {{happened}} to see you standing there, crouching and shaking. That's the right way to bring him upon you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Who {{told you}} that he does?' replied my father; 'he is OMNI SUSPICIONE MAJOR, so far as worldly {{circumstances}} are concerned. It is to be hoped he makes a good use of them; though, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>it</b> {{will be for the}} first time in his life.' ...|$|R

He doesn't, in {{the first}} place, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>it</b> would prob'ly be because you keep hinting at him and dinging at him so much.

6000|$|... "I believe {{men will}} be fools enough for anything," [...] said Lady de Courcy. [...] "But, of course, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>it</b> would come to nothing afterwards.

60|$|L. You {{only think}} it so {{beautiful}} {{because you know}} it is gold. It is not prettier, in reality, than a bit of brass for it is Transylvanian gold; and they say there is a foolish gnome in the mines there, who is always wanting to live in the moon, and so alloys all the gold with a little silver. I don't know how that may be, but the silver always IS in the gold, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it,</b> it's very provoking of him, for no gold is woven so fine anywhere else.|$|R

60|$|Before sunrise {{the next}} day, Jimmy and the Typee started {{in two of}} the ship’s boats, which were manned by tabooed natives.

6000|$|... "We've {{got to do}} {{something}} about that child, Ogden. He's been worrying uncle Peter again, and I'm not going to have it.

60|$|Stephen begged {{them to let}} him remain {{till the}} next day but they swore that, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>it</b> should be the worse for him, and {{immediately}} escorted him {{beyond the bounds of}} Normandy.

50|$|French Bulldogs make {{excellent}} companions. The French Bulldog rarely barks, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> is to draw attention, {{to point}} out that he needs something (like attention). This breed is patient and affectionate with its owners, especially with children, who are especially protected by the females. French Bulldogs can easily live with other breeds when the proper introductions are done.|$|R
5000|$|He was renowned {{as perhaps}} the toughest tackler of his day, giving rise to the (probably apocryphal) story that his wife once {{expressed}} the fear that he would [...] "come home one day with a broken leg."

60|$|The {{idea that}} no gentleman ever swears is all wrong; he can swear {{and still be}} a gentleman <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> in a nice and, benevolent and affectionate way. The historian, John Fiske, whom I knew well and loved, was a spotless and most noble and upright Christian gentleman, and yet he swore once. Not exactly that, maybe; still, he--but I will tell you about it.|$|R
