50|$|There are two {{distinct}} genetically determined types of earwax: the wet type, which is dominant, and the <b>dry</b> <b>type,</b> which is recessive. While East Asians and Native Americans {{are more likely}} to have the <b>dry</b> <b>type</b> of cerumen (gray and flaky), African and European people {{are more likely to}} have the wet type (honey-brown to dark-brown and moist). Cerumen type has been used by anthropologists to track human migratory patterns, such as those of the Eskimos. In Japan, wet-type earwax is more prevalent among the Ainu, in contrast to that country's Yamato majority. The consistency of wet type earwax is due to the higher concentration of lipid and pigment s (50% lipid) in the substance than the <b>dry</b> <b>type</b> (30% lipid).|$|R

40|$|The {{patterns}} of raglan, semi raglan, kimono, and dropped shoulder sleeves {{are made on}} {{one and the same}} constructional bases. In the constructional base the front and back in the underarm there are parts which have to be set to the both - the bodice and the sleeve. For the front and the back that is possible if the sleeve and a part of the bodice are separated by a design constructional seam. The type and design of the sleeve depends by the directions of the design constructional seam. If the seam joins the underarm and the neckline, or area around the neckline the <b>type</b> of <b>sleeve</b> is raglan. If the seam connects the underarm and the shoulder the <b>type</b> of <b>sleeve</b> is semi raglan. The <b>type</b> of the <b>sleeve</b> is kimono if the design constructional seam divides the bodice or the sleeve. In the dropped shoulder sleeve design constructional seam is located under the shoulder. The use of the main design principles, the possibilities for combinations between the four <b>types</b> of <b>sleeves</b> and the design with application of 3 D elements are investigated. Raglan, semi raglan, kimono and dropped shoulder sleeves can be combined each other. In combined sleeves only one of seams which define the <b>types</b> of the <b>sleeves</b> is with decorative constructional function. The other ones have only decorative function. Design constructional seams which define the <b>types</b> of the <b>sleeves</b> can be used as contours of location or fixation of all types of 3 D elements: pleats, goffers, flounces, tucks gathers, and draperies. The results of the investigation of application of the main design principles, combinations between different <b>types</b> of <b>sleeves</b> and possibility for the use of 3 D elements facilitate the process of fashion design and pattern making and gives opportunity for variety of models...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{a thermal}} model of cast- resin <b>dry</b> <b>type</b> {{transformer}} is proposed. The proposed thermal model is solved by finite element technique {{to get the}} temperature at any location of the transformer. The basic modes of heat transfer such as conduction; convection and radiation are used to get the steady state temperature distribution of the transformer. The predicted temperatures are compared with experimental results reported in this paper and it is found a good agreement between them. The effects of various parameters such as width of air duct, ambient temperature and emissivity of the outer surface were also studied.

The results showed that vegetation was highly related to soil texture, but was not obviously related to fire history.

Indicators of site productivity [...] height and volume increment of loblolly pine, and stand basal area [...] were weakly related to vegetation type, but not related to soil texture. The lack of a relationship between these indicators and soil texture suggests that site productivity may not be related simply to soil texture and that interactions with other species may obscure the response of loblolly pine to site productivity.
