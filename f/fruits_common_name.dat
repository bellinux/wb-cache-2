The tree is of value for several reasons: it produces nutritious fruits, is locally prominent in folk medicine is a source of quality timber. It could contribute to food security, sustainable land care, and rural development. As its Linnaean name indicates, it is native to Senegal and the surrounding countries of West Africa.|$|R
5000|$|Acca sellowiana, {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae, is native to the highlands of southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay, Uruguay, northern Argentina, and Colombia.

5000|$|Solanum retroflexum, {{commonly}} known as wonderberry or sunberry, is a historic heirloom <b>fruiting</b> shrub. Both <b>common</b> <b>names</b> are also used for the sometimes poisonous European black nightshade (Solanum nigrum) in some places, particularly where the latter species has been introduced, so {{care must be taken}} to distinguish them. It is sometimes called garden huckleberry, but that properly refers to the S. scabrum described by Philip Miller.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} {{commonly}} used as a landscaping tree along roadways and in residential areas in South Florida. Today, it is being widely planted outside of its natural historic range in South Florida and the Caribbean because {{of its ability to}} grow under various conditions. It is used by gardeners and can be grown in containers or in arboretums, which showcase this species’ prolific inflorescences and <b>fruit.</b> Its <b>common</b> <b>name</b> derives from the use of its fronds in thatched roofing. Its fronds are the most used part of the palm, being utilized in broom construction, handicrafts, and food wrapping. While T. radiata's white fruit are inedible, its trunks have recently been used to construct lobster traps by fishermen in the Yucatán peninsula.|$|R
50|$|Eurosta solidaginis is in {{the order}} Diptera and the family Tephritidae. The Tephritidae are {{commonly}} referred to as <b>fruit</b> flies, a <b>common</b> <b>name</b> they share with the Drosophilidae Drosophilidae. The goldenrod gall fly was first put into the genus Eurosta by D. W. Cocquillet in 1910. Two subspecies exist: E. solidaginis subsp. solidaginis and E. solidaginis subsp. fascipennis, distinguished morphologically by differences in hyaline regions of the wing margin. The former subspecies can be further subdivided into two host races, one of which forms galls in Solidago altissima and the other in S. gigantea.|$|R
500|$|In 1953, Rokuya Imazeki {{took into}} {{consideration}} differences in spore characteristics: species in the genus Cantharellus were not known to have spores that were subglobose (roughly spherical) and tuberculate (covered with wart-like projections) like Polyozellus; however, these spore characteristics were common in species in the Thelephoraceae family (Cantharellus belongs in a different family, the Cantharellaceae). Other characteristics linking the blue chanterelle with the Thelephoraceae included the dark color, the strong odor (especially in dried specimens), {{and the presence of}} thelephoric acid, a mushroom [...] pigment common in the family. Taken together, these factors led Imazeki to propose the new family Phylacteriaceae. The suggested family-level taxonomical change was not accepted by other authors; for example, in 1954, Seiichi Kawamura renamed it Thelephora multiplex. As of 2009, both Index Fungorum and MycoBank list Polyozellus as being within the Thelephoraceae family, a grouping of mushrooms commonly known as the leathery earthfans. The genus name is derived from the Greek poly meaning many, and oz, meaning branch. The specific epithet multiplex means [...] "in many pieces", referring to the compound nature of the <b>fruit</b> body. <b>Common</b> <b>names</b> for this species include the blue chanterelle and the clustered blue chanterelle. In Alaska, where specimens typically have very dark-colored fruit bodies, it is called the black chanterelle, although this name is shared with some Craterellus species.|$|R
50|$|C. scandens is {{native to}} central and eastern North America. It was given the name {{bittersweet}} by colonists in the 18th century because the fruits resembled {{the appearance of the}} <b>fruits</b> of <b>common</b> nightshade (Solanum dulcamara), which was also called bittersweet. Today, American bittersweet is the accepted <b>common</b> <b>name</b> of C. scandens in large part to distinguish it from an invasive relative, C. orbiculatus (Oriental bittersweet), from Asia.|$|R

5000|$|Following this, Hoffy {{began work}} with the {{physician}} and amateur pomologist William D. Brincklé on {{a new series of}} publications on native North American fruits to be published under the general title North American Pomologist. Individual volumes would be edited by Brincklé (who was for many years the vice-president of the Philadelphia Horticultural Society) and would consist of 36 pages of information on different kinds of fruit illustrated with 10 color plates. The illustrations were produced as stone lithographs drawn by Hoffy (signed [...] "From Nature by A. Hoffy") and colored under his direction. The fruit is usually shown in a full-color side view, sometimes accompanied by a simple black outline of the fruit's profile. Hoffy and Brincklé felt this series was needed because of [...] "repeated disappointments which have attended the cultivation of Foreign Fruits in this country" [...] and also to clear up increasing confusion over <b>common</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>names.</b> The entire series was published together in 1860 in a single volume as Hoffy's North American Pomologist.|$|R
