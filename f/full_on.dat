5|$|Although the two clubs {{claimed to}} have sold most of the 42,000 tickets {{allocated}} to them, only about 25,000 fans {{were said to have}} travelled to Moscow from the United Kingdom, with about 110 charter flights arriving ahead of the game. According {{to the head of the}} Russian national tourist office, Mikhail Ignatiev, many fans were put off by the cost of travel and accommodation. Additionally, most of Moscow's hotels were <b>full</b> <b>on</b> the night of the game. As some fans looked to offload tickets to the match, The Moscow Times reported that the black-market price dropped from a high of €2,000 (£1,600) to around €500 (£400), while Russian TV channel Sport-1 was reporting prices as low as £300 for tickets belonging to fans who had failed to make the trip to Moscow. Among the celebrities who did not travel were Chelsea supporter and chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) Sebastian Coe, who had to attend meetings ahead of the 2012 Summer Olympics, and Manchester United fan and Simply Red lead singer Mick Hucknall, who was due to perform at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.|$|E

5|$|Kusaka {{correctly}} {{saw these}} strikes as {{a precursor to}} U.S. troop landings, {{in part due to}} Imperial Navy intelligence collected over the previous week. Because he was still unsure exactly where enemy forces would land, he chose to execute the air component of Sho-1 or Sho-2the planned defense of the Philippines or Formosa, respectivelyon the morning of 10October. Sho was a complex plan involving multiple naval surface forces sortieing from bases as far away as Singapore and Japan. It would take these warships time to maneuver into position for a concerted attack. Rather than waiting for the arrival of the fleet for a combination of sea and air power, Kusaka ordered the air forces reserved for Sho to engage the enemy at once. He reinforced this order by implementing Sho-2 in <b>full</b> <b>on</b> the morning of 12October.|$|E

5|$|The first Sky {{television}} rights {{agreement was}} worth £304million over five seasons. The next contract, negotiated {{to start from}} the 1997–98 season, rose to £670million over four seasons. The third contract was a £1.024billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001–02 to 2003–04. The league brought in £320million {{from the sale of}} its international rights for the three-year period from 2004–05 to 2006–07. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis. Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid a total of £1.7billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for £171.6million, a 63percent increase on the £105million it paid for the previous three-year period. Sky and BT have agreed to jointly pay £84.3million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in <b>full</b> <b>on</b> television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10pm on matchday. Overseas television rights fetched £625million, nearly double the previous contract. The total raised from these deals is more than £2.7billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.|$|E

Columbia Records allowed the record to stream in <b>full</b> <b>on</b> iTunes in the week leading up to its 13 November 2012 release. In addition, One Direction promoted the album {{in a series of}} live appearances from October toward December, notably on television programmes The X Factor USA, The X Factor UK, The Today Show, which drew a record crowd of 15.000 people to the Rockefeller Center, and the BBC's Children in Need 2012 telethon. Additional live appearances include at the Royal Variety Performance, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II, the Bambi Awards, and a headlining sold-out show at New York City's Madison Square Garden. The album's accompanying concert tour, the Take Me Home Tour, commenced at London's O2 Arena on 23 February 2013. The concert tour consists of over 100 shows in Australasia, Europe, and North America, and is set to visit arenas and stadiums from February through October 2013. Announced by member Liam Payne at the 2012 BRIT Awards in early 2012, the original concert tour was billed as the UK & Ireland Arena Tour. In mid-2012, the concert tour expanded with legs in North America and Australasia following the band's international breakthrough. In the UK and Ireland, ticket sales reached 300,000 within a day of release, which included a six-date sell out at the O2 Arena in London. In Australian and New Zealand markets, tickets grossed US$15.7 million, with all 190,000 tickets being sold for eighteen shows to be held in Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
