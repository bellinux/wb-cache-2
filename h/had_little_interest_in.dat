5|$|Hoffman {{paid for}} his middle nephew's {{business}} classes at the Academy of Commerce until his 1912 graduation, and arranged his hiring by the stock exchange soon after. Unlike his older brother Imre, {{who worked at the}} exchange in Budapest for all his life, Kertész <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the field. He was drawn to illustrated magazines and to activities like fishing and swimming in the Danube River near his uncle's property.|$|E
5|$|Olga Rudge, {{pregnant}} with Pound's child, followed them to Italy. She <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> raising a child, but {{may have felt}} that having one would maintain her connection to him. In July 1925 {{she gave birth to}} their daughter, Mary. Olga placed the child with a German-speaking peasant woman whose own child had died, and who agreed to raise Mary for 200 lire a month.|$|E
5|$|Alexander was erudite and patronized both {{arts and}} sciences. However, he <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> sports or the Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos). He had great {{charisma}} and force of personality, characteristics {{which made him}} a great leader. His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander {{had the ability to}} do so.|$|E

5|$|Banned from competition, Chambers sought {{alternative}} commercial {{outlets for}} his athletic prowess. He had an unsuccessful American football try-out with the San Francisco 49ers, hoping to emulate Renaldo Nehemiah. He drifted {{on to the}} celebrity circuit, appearing on British reality television series Hell's Kitchen in May 2004. However, Chambers <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the show and soon chose to leave. He appeared in neither sporting events nor television programs for 18 months.|$|E
5|$|Constantine met {{his future}} wife, Norma Agatha Cox, in 1921. She <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> cricket and, {{although}} their relationship {{developed during the}} early 1920s, she resented that he gave more time to cricket than he did to her. However, the relationship lasted {{and she began to}} take more of an interest in his sporting achievements. They were married on 25 July 1927; their only child, Gloria, was born in April 1928. Throughout their marriage, his wife motivated him to continue his efforts to further his career and they remained close. Norma died two months after her husband in 1971.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Nalder {{reported}} after {{a survey}} of his province {{that there was a}} general lack of tribal cohesion. Governor-General Sir Stewart Symes at Khartoum <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> development of the south of Sudan and he advised the local officials that chiefs should have territorial rather than ethnic authority. In 1936 Mongalla and the Bahr al-Ghazal provinces were incorporated into the Equatoria province, with headquarters at Juba, with parts of Upper Nile province detached.|$|E

5|$|Suharto's {{upbringing}} {{contrasts with}} that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as Sukarno in that he {{is believed to have}} <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> anti-colonialism, or political concerns beyond his immediate surroundings. Unlike Sukarno and his circle, Suharto had little or no contact with European colonizers. Consequently, he did not learn to speak Dutch or other European languages in his youth. He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940.|$|E
5|$|William Kenrick MP; {{she died}} when he was a small boy. Joseph Chamberlain had had another son, Austen Chamberlain, by his first marriage. Neville Chamberlain was educated at Rugby School. Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to Mason College (the future University of Birmingham).

Within six months he became a {{salaried}} employee.|$|E
5|$|Although ferries (and later bridges) {{had crossed}} the river to the east at Richmond since 1459 and to the west at Eel Pie Island since at least 1652 the lands {{to the south of}} the river at this point had {{historically}} been privately held by the Tollemache family (owners of Ham House) and off limits to the public. Consequently, despite the distance from the nearest crossings there was little demand for cross-river services at this location. Additionally, the Tollemache family had licensing rights for the Twickenham Ferry at Eel Pie Island (sometimes known as Dysart's ferry after the family), and consequently <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> promoting a competing service. The Twickenham Ferry is a setting for some action in Little Dorritt by Charles Dickens.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Stepnogorsk base fell under the purview of the nascent Kazakh government, who, <b>having</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> weapons of mass destruction, let the secret city fall into disrepair.|$|R

50|$|It {{has been}} accepted, {{at least by}} the Latino {{communities}} in Europe, that the media <b>has</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> covering {{the positive aspects of}} Latino-American culture, and that if important events are covered, it is mostly done under the European viewpoint.|$|R
5|$|Although he <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> formal {{education}} and rarely attended classes, Sylvester was enrolled at Jordan High School. He graduated in 1969 {{at the age}} of 21; in his graduation photograph, he appeared in drag wearing a blue chiffon prom dress and beehive hairstyle. By the end of the decade, the Disquotays had begun to drift apart, with a number of them abandoning cross-dressing and others recognizing that they were trans women and undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Sylvester always considered himself male and began to tone down the feminine nature of his clothing, aiming for a more androgynous look which combined male and female styles and which was influenced by the fashions of the hippie movement.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} the Knights were buying lands in Prussia. In May 1392, von Wallenrode began negotiations with Sigismund of Hungary to buy Neumark for 500,000 guldens. Negotiations fell apart {{as the title}} to the land was contested by several dukes. The Neumark purchase was closed with Jobst of Moravia only in 1402. During July 1392, the Knights agreed to pay Władysław Opolczyk 50,000 guldens for the Dobrzyń Land, which had been contested among Piast dukes since 1377. Opolczyk, the ruler of Opole in Silesia, <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the volatile regions to his north. In 1392, he circulated a proposal to partition Poland among the Teutonic Knights, the Holy Roman Empire, Silesia, and Hungary, but it was rejected. These purchases by the Knights threatened Poland's northern borders.|$|E
5|$|Nixon in China {{formally}} premiered on the Brown Stage {{at the new}} Wortham Theater Center in Houston on October 22, 1987, with John DeMain {{conducting the}} Houston Grand Opera. Former president Nixon was invited, and was sent {{a copy of the}} libretto; however, his staff indicated that he was unable to attend, due to illness and an impending publication deadline. A Nixon representative later stated that the former president disliked seeing himself on television or other media, and <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> opera. According to Adams, he was later told by former Nixon lawyer Leonard Garment that Nixon was highly interested in everything written about him, and so likely saw the Houston production when it was televised on PBS' Great Performances.|$|E
50|$|Kotogaume {{throughout}} his career relied almost entirely on pushing and thrusting techniques, and seemed to <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> using his opponent's mawashi for throws.

50|$|Since {{learning}} {{is an active}} process, students must have freedom: freedom of choice, freedom of action, freedom to bear the results of action—these are the three great freedoms that constitute personal responsibility. If no freedom is granted, students may <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> learning.|$|R
5|$|Chamberlain {{attended}} Rugby School. Unhappy {{during his}} school years, {{he made no}} lasting friendships there. Although he did reasonably well in his classes, he was not outstanding academically or athletically, and his father withdrew him from the school four months short of his eighteenth birthday. In later years, as Chamberlain rose to the heights of British politics, he seldom visited the school, did not enrol his own son, and rarely spoke of his time there. Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to Mason College (which later developed into the University of Birmingham), which both emphasised the politician's connection to Birmingham and catered to the interest in science which Neville had shown at Rugby. Neville Chamberlain studied metallurgy and engineering for two years, but <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the subjects. In 1889 his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants. Within six months, he became a salaried employee.|$|E
5|$|Murray Robson {{replaced}} Treatt as Leader of the Opposition in August 1954. Like {{other senior}} members of the Liberals, after having no conservative government since Alexander Mair in 1941, Robson had no experience in government, he <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> policy except for Cold War anti-communism, ignored majority views of his party and fellow parliamentary colleagues and Robson's attempts to forge a closer alliance with Bruxner and the Country Party, failed dismally and alienated him from many in his party. Robson was replaced by Pat Morton as leader in September 1955. Bruxner, now aged 70 and having fallen ill several times, led the Country Party one last time at the March 1956 election, which resulted in another labour victory and Country Party regained the seat of Armidale, but overall the government's majority fell from twenty to six. Bruxner retained Tenterfield unopposed.|$|E
5|$|Richard's son, Edmund {{took over}} the earldom in 1278 but <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> Lydford, preferring Restormel and Lostwithiel; by his death in 1299 the castle had been left to decay and was in ruins. It reverted to the Crown, and when Edward II made his royal favourite, Piers Gaveston, the Earl of Cornwall in 1307, Lydford Castle was passed to him. The castle was {{repaired}} {{at the start of}} the century and was in use once again as a prison. Edward II and Gaveston fell from power in 1327 and Thomas le Ercedekne was temporarily entrusted with the castle and Dartmoor by the new regime. In 1329 the castle was valued at a little over £11. Piers Gaveston's widow, Margaret de Clare, leased the property to Tavistock Abbey, and it continued to operate as a prison.|$|E
5000|$|... "Worcester woman" [...] is a {{political}} term used by polling companies in the United Kingdom.

5|$|The Civil War {{culminated in}} the {{execution}} of the king in 1649, the overthrow of the English monarchy, and the establishment of the Commonwealth of England. Charles I's son, Charles II, was proclaimed King of Great Britain in Scotland, but he was forced to flee abroad after he invaded England and was defeated at the Battle of Worcester. In 1653, Oliver Cromwell, the most prominent military and political leader in the nation, seized power and declared himself Lord Protector (effectively becoming a military dictator, but refusing the title of king). Cromwell ruled until his death in 1658, when he was succeeded by his son Richard. The new Lord Protector <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> governing; he soon resigned. The lack of clear leadership led to civil and military unrest, and for a popular desire to restore the monarchy. In 1660, the monarchy was restored and Charles II returned to Britain.|$|E
5|$|The Nixon {{presidency}} {{witnessed the}} first large-scale integration {{of public schools}} in the South. Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites. Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then. Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools. Agnew <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz. Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance. Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{tried to}} enforce a controversial media law that would see Clarín lose licenses and be forced to sell most of its assets. The law was initially sanctioned as a competition law for the media, but critics pointed {{out that it is}} only being used to further the campaign against Clarín. The government <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> enforcing measures of the law that were not related to Clarín. Clarín launched a constitutional challenge against some articles of the law with the judiciary. The government released an anti-Clarín advertisement claiming it refused to obey the law and may be subverting democracy. The conflict led to disputes with the judiciary. Minister Julio Alak said that extending an injunction that allowed Clarín to keep its assets during the trial would be an insurrection, and it was rumored that judges who did not rule as the government wished might face impeachment. The court extended the inunction.|$|E

25|$|However, in England, the Government views badger {{vaccination}} as {{a necessary}} part of a package of measures for controlling bTB, because it estimates the cost of vaccination to be around £2,250 per square kilometre per annum, and notes that most landowners and farmers <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> paying this cost themselves.|$|R
