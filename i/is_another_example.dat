5|$|Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen, {{also built}} by Christian IV, <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>example</b> of the Dutch Renaissance style. In 1606, the king first had a two-storey summerhouse {{built on a}} site he used as a park for relaxation. He then decided to start work on a much more ambitious building, the castle, which {{developed}} in stages until a Dutch Renaissance masterpiece was completed in 1624. Predating the castle, the Renaissance-style park, is Denmark's oldest royal garden.|$|E

5|$|Italy {{has also}} become a home {{for a number of}} Mediterranean fusion projects. These include Al Darawish, a {{multicultural}} band based in Sicily and led by Palestinian Nabil Ben Salaméh. The Luigi Cinque Tarantula Hypertext Orchestra <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>example,</b> as is the TaraGnawa project by Phaleg and Nour Eddine. Mango is one of the best-known artists who fused pop with world and mediterranean sounds, albums such as Adesso, Sirtaki and Come l'acqua are examples of his style.

5|$|Eclipsing {{variables}} are star systems that vary in brightness {{because of one}} star passing {{in front of the}} other rather than from any intrinsic change in luminosity. W Ursae Minoris is one such system, its magnitude ranging from 8.51 to 9.59 over 1.7 days. The combined spectrum of the system is A2V, but the masses of the two component stars are unknown. A slight change in the orbital period in 1973 suggests there is a third component of the multiple star system—most likely a red dwarf—with an orbital period of 62.2±3.9 years. RU Ursae Minoris <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>example,</b> ranging from 10 to 10.66 over 0.52days. It is a semidetached system, as the secondary star is filling its Roche lobe and transferring matter to the primary.|$|E
5|$|Re Lim Chor Pee, {{ex parte}} Law Society of Singapore (1985) <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>example</b> {{of a case}} where a {{mandatory}} order was granted by the High Court. The appellant, Lim Chor Pee, who was an advocate and solicitor, {{had been convicted of}} several income tax offences and had been found to have tampered with a witness. On 16 July 1982, the Attorney-General wrote to the President of the Law Society of Singapore, providing information on the appellant's conviction and other records. Following a report by the Society's Inquiry Committee that a formal inquiry into the appellant's conduct was necessary, a Disciplinary Committee was appointed. The appellant successfully applied to the Disciplinary Committee to delete certain paragraphs of the statement of case which had been formulated against him by the Council of the Law Society, on the ground that the facts in those paragraphs did not appear in the Inquiry Committee's report. Consequently, three of the six charges against the appellant and a major portion of one other charge did not require investigation by the Disciplinary Committee. Dissatisfied with this decision, the Law Society applied to the High Court for an order of mandamus to direct the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate all the six charges against the appellant. The High Court granted the application, holding that under the Legal Profession Act, the Inquiry Committee's only function was to consider the matters before it and decide whether or not there should be a formal investigation by a Disciplinary Committee. It was the duty of the Council of the Law Society to draw up the charges, and the duty of the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate the charges properly before the Committee in the statement of case. Thus, the appellant could not object that some of the charges against him were based on facts not mentioned in the Inquiry Committee's report. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.|$|E
