50|$|The UJT {{is biased}} with a {{positive}} voltage between the two bases. This causes a potential drop {{along the length of}} the device. When the emitter voltage is driven approximately one diode voltage above the voltage at the point where the P diffusion (emitter) is, current will begin to flow from the emitter into the base region. Because the base region is very lightly doped, the additional current (actually charges in the base region) causes conductivity modulation which reduces the resistance of the portion of the base between the emitter junction and the B2 terminal. This reduction in resistance means that the emitter junction is more forward biased, and so even more current is injected. Overall, the effect is a negative resistance at the <b>emitter</b> <b>terminal.</b> This is what makes the UJT useful, especially in simple oscillator circuits.|$|E

40|$|Terahertz (THz) and sub-millimeter wave band {{are known}} to provide unique {{applications}} in spectroscopy, imaging and high-data-rate wireless communication. An imaging system operating in this frequency region exhibits non-invasive and high-resolution characteristics due to the non-ionized and short-wavelength radiation waves, which makes it attracting for security surveillance. On the other hand, the THz wireless transceiver operating in the license-free spectrum is capable of achieving tens of gigabits-per-second by utilizing a simple modulation scheme. All the benefits mentioned above make THz a promising research topic. Towards realization of a high-performance THz system, {{one of the most}} challenging steps is to design a frequency synthesizer. A voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is one of the important building blocks within a synthesizer. Due to the server performance degradation of varactors and transistors at high frequencies, new ways of designing VCOs need to be investigated. Here, two different ideas are proposed. First, an inductive-tuning mechanism with high quality-factor and wide tuning-range is introduced. This tuning technique is based on a variable inductor seen at the <b>emitter</b> <b>terminal</b> of a base-degenerated transistor. By adding a series RL at the base terminal, the variable inductor, exhibiting low loss and high tunability, improves the VCO output power and phase noise while achieving a wide tuning range. The second idea, double-stacked cross-coupled VCO, is to design a strong negative resistance cell to compensate for the server loss of the varactor at THz frequencies. By implementing a source-degenerated negative resistor of a conventional cross-coupled pair, the overall negative resistance is enhanced. It also reduces the parasitic capacitance, making it an attracting approach for THz applications. Finally, a novel THz frequency synthesizer is proposed. A 300 GHz phase-locked-based synthesizer incorporating a triple-push VCO with Colpitts-based active varactor (CAV) and a three-phase injection locked divider is introduced. The CAV is used to tune the oscillation frequency, enhance output power, and buffer the VCO's fundamental signal.

40|$|AbstractIn cyanobacteria, {{the thermal}} {{dissipation}} of excess absorbed energy {{at the level}} of the phycobilisome (PBS) -antenna is triggered by absorption of strong blue-green light by the photoactive orange carotenoid protein (OCP). This process known as non-photochemical quenching, whose molecular mechanism remains in many respects unclear, is revealed in vivo as a decrease in phycobilisome fluorescence. In vitro reconstituted system on the interaction of the OCP and the PBS isolated from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 presents evidence that the OCP is not only a photosensor, but also an effecter that makes direct contacts with the PBS and causes dissipation of absorbed energy. To localize the site(s) of quenching, we have analyzed the role of chromophorylated polypeptides of the PBS using PBS-deficient mutants in conjunction with in vitro systems of assembled PBS and of isolated components of the PBS core. The results demonstrated that LCM, the core-membrane linker protein and <b>terminal</b> <b>emitter</b> of the PBS, could act as the docking site for OCP in vitro. The ApcD and ApcF <b>terminal</b> <b>emitters</b> of the PBS core are not directly subjected to quenching. The data suggests that there could be close contact between the phycocyanobilin chromophore of LCM and the 3 ′-hydroxyechinenone chromophore present in OCP and that LCM could be involved in OCP-induced quenching. According to the reduced average life-time of the PBS-fluorescence and linear dependence of fluorescence intensity of the PBS on OCP concentration, the quenching has mostly dynamic character.

The efficiency of these energy transfer processes involves a complicated interplay of pigment-protein structural reorganization and protein dynamic disorder, and the system must stay robust within the fluctuating protein environment. The final, lowest energy site has been proposed to exist within a trimeric excitonically coupled chlorophyll (Chl) cluster, comprising Chls a 610 -a 611 -a 612. We studied an LHCII monomer with a site-specific mutation resulting {{in the loss of}} Chls a 611 and a 612, and find that this mutant exhibits two predominant overlapping fluorescence bands. From a combination of bulk measurements, single-molecule fluorescence characterization, and modeling, we propose the two fluorescence bands originate from differing conditions of exciton delocalization and localization realized in the mutant. Disruption of the excitonically coupled <b>terminal</b> <b>emitter</b> Chl trimer results in an increased sensitivity of the excited state energy landscape to the disorder induced by the protein conformations. Consequently, the mutant demonstrates a loss of energy transfer efficiency. On the contrary, in the wild-type complex, the strong resonance coupling and correspondingly high degree of excitation delocalization within the Chls a 610 -a 611 -a 612 cluster dampens the influence of the environment and ensures optimal communication with neighboring pigments.

The objective was to understand the actual biochemical process and pathways that determine the EET mechanism. Anisotropy of the EET pathway was calculated from the absorption change trace {{in order to determine the}} contribution of excitonic coupling. The results reveal a new electron energy relaxation pathway of 14 ps inside the phycocyanin component, which runs from phycocyanin to the <b>terminal</b> <b>emitter.</b> The bleaching of the 660 nm band suggests a broader absorption of the <b>terminal</b> <b>emitter</b> between 660 nm and 675 nm.

Under conditions of low ionic strength buffer solution, the evolution of the kinetic amplitude during the depolarization of the trimer is suggestive of trimer conservation within the phycocyanin hexamer.

On the minute time scale this leads to redirection of the excitation energy, usually referred to as state transitions, which involves movement of the phycobilisomes. We have studied short-term light adaptation in isolated heterocysts and intact filaments from the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133. In N. punctiforme vegetative cells differentiate into heterocysts where nitrogen fixation takes place. Photosystem II is inactivated in the heterocysts, and the abundancy of Photosystem I is increased relative to the vegetative cells. To study light-induced changes in energy transfer to Photosystem I, pre-illumination was made to dark adapted isolated heterocysts. Illumination wavelengths were chosen to excite Photosystem I (708 nm) or phycobilisomes (560 nm) specifically. In heterocysts that were pre-illuminated at 708 nm, fluorescence from the phycobilisome <b>terminal</b> <b>emitter</b> was observed in the 77 K emission spectrum. However, illumination with 560 nm light caused quenching of the emission from the <b>terminal</b> <b>emitter,</b> with a simultaneous increase in the emission at 750 nm, indicating that the 560 nm pre-illumination caused trimerization of Photosystem I. Excitation spectra showed that 560 nm pre-illumination led {{to an increase in}} excitation transfer from the phycobilisomes to trimeric Photosystem I. Illumination at 708 nm did not lead to increased energy transfer from the phycobilisome to Photosystem I compared to dark adapted samples.

The latter complexes are believed to form a rod-shaped structure comprising three homo-hexamers of phycocyanin (PC), one hetero-hexamer of phycocyanin and allophycocyanin (APC) and probably a linker protein connecting the PBPs to the reaction centre. Excitation energy transfer and electron-vibrational coupling in PBPs have been investigated by selectively excited fluorescence spectra. The data reveal a rich spectral substructure with a total of five low-energy electronic states with fluorescence bands at 635 nm, 645 nm, 654 nm, 659 nm and a <b>terminal</b> <b>emitter</b> at about 673 nm. The electronic states at ~ 635 and 645 nm are tentatively attributed to PC and APC, respectively, while an apparent heterogeneity among PC subunits may also play a role. The other fluorescence bands may be associated with three different isoforms of the linker protein. Furthermore, a large number of vibrational features can be identified for each electronic state with intense phonon sidebands peaking at about 31 to 37 cm− 1, which are among the highest phonon frequencies observed for photosynthetic antenna complexes. The corresponding Huang-Rhys factors S fall in the range between 0. 98 (<b>terminal</b> <b>emitter),</b> 1. 15 (APC), and 1. 42 (PC). Two characteristic vibronic lines at about 1580 and 1634 cm− 1 appear to reflect CNH+ and CC stretching modes of the PCB chromophore, respectively.

40|$|AbstractAs high-intensity solar {{radiation}} {{can lead to}} extensive damage of the photosynthetic apparatus, cyanobacteria have developed various protection mechanisms to reduce the effective excitation energy transfer (EET) from the antenna complexes to the reaction center. One of them is non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of the phycobilisome (PB) fluorescence. In Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 this role is carried by the orange carotenoid protein (OCP), which reacts to high-intensity light {{by a series of}} conformational changes, enabling the binding of OCP to the PBs reducing the flow of energy into the photosystems. In this paper the mechanisms of energy migration in two mutant PB complexes of Synechocystis sp. were investigated and compared. The mutant CK is lacking phycocyanin in the PBs while the mutant ΔPSI/PSII does not contain both photosystems. Fluorescence decay spectra with picosecond time resolution were registered using a single photon counting technique. The studies were performed {{in a wide range of}} temperatures — from 4 to 300 K. The time course of NPQ and fluorescence recovery in darkness was studied at room temperature using both steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements. The OCP induced NPQ has been shown to be due to EET from PB cores to the red form of OCP under photon flux densities up to 1000 μmolphotonsm− 2 s− 1. The gradual changes of the energy transfer rate from allophycocyanin to OCP were observed during the irradiation of the sample with blue light and consequent adaptation to darkness. This fact was interpreted as the revelation of intermolecular interaction between OCP and PB binding site. At low temperatures a significantly enhanced EET from allophycocyanin to <b>terminal</b> <b>emitters</b> has been shown, due to the decreased back transfer from <b>terminal</b> <b>emitter</b> to APC. The activation of OCP not only leads to fluorescence quenching, but also affects the rate constants of energy transfer as shown by model based analysis of the decay associated spectra. The results indicate that the ability of OCP to quench the fluorescence is strongly temperature dependent.

Inspection of the LHCII X-ray structures shows that of the Chl molecules in the <b>terminal</b> <b>emitter</b> domain, where excited-state energy accumulates prior to further transfer or dissipation, the C 4, 5 and 6 atoms are in closest proximity to lutein; supporting quenching mechanisms that involve altered Chl-lutein interactions in the dissipative state. In addition the observed changes could represent altered interactions between Chla and neoxanthin, which alters its configuration under NPQ conditions. The Chls appear to have increased dynamics in unquenched, detergent-solubilized LHCII. Our work demonstrates that solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is applicable to investigate high-resolution structural details of light-harvesting proteins in varied functional conditions, and represents a valuable tool to address their molecular plasticity associated with photoprotection...|$|R
40|$|Biology {{offers a}} {{boundless}} source of adaptation, innovation, and inspiration. A {{wide range of}} photosynthetic organisms exist {{that are capable of}} harvesting solar light in an exceptionally efficient way, using abundant and low-cost materials. These natural light-harvesting complexes consist of proteins that strongly bind a high density of chromophores to capture solar photons and rapidly transfer the excitation energy to the photochemical reaction centre. The amount of harvested light is also delicately tuned to the level of solar radiation to maintain a constant energy throughput at the reaction centre and avoid the accumulation of the products of charge separation. In this Review, recent developments in the understanding of light harvesting by plants will be discussed, based on results obtained from single molecule spectroscopy studies. Three design principles of the main light-harvesting antenna of plants will be highlighted: (a) fine, photoactive control over the intrinsic protein disorder to efficiently use intrinsically available thermal energy dissipation mechanisms; (b) the design of the protein microenvironment of a low-energy chromophore dimer to control the amount of shade absorption; (c) the design of the exciton manifold to ensure efficient funneling of the harvested light to the <b>terminal</b> <b>emitter</b> cluster.

40|$|AbstractBy using {{absorption}} and fluorescence spectroscopy, {{we compared}} the effects of heat and light treatments on the phycobilisome (PBS) antenna of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells. Fluorescence emission spectra obtained upon exciting predominantly PBS, recorded at 25  °C and 77  K, revealed characteristic changes upon heat treatment of the cells. A 5 -min incubation at 50  °C, which completely inactivated the activity of photosystem II, led to a small but statistically significant decrease in the F 680 /F 655 fluorescence intensity ratio. In contrast, heat treatment at 60  °C resulted in a much larger decrease in the same ratio and {{was accompanied by a}} blue-shift of the main PBS emission band at around 655  nm (F 655), indicating an energetic decoupling of PBS from chlorophylls and reorganizations in its internal structure. (Upon exciting PBS, F 680 originates from photosystem II and from the <b>terminal</b> <b>emitter</b> of PBS.). Very similar changes were obtained upon exposing the cells to high light (600 – 7500  μmol photons m− 2 s− 1) for different time periods (10  min to 3  h). In cells with heat-inactivated photosystem II, the variations caused by light treatment could clearly be assigned to a similar energetic decoupling of the PBS from the membrane and internal reorganizations as induced at around 60  °C. These data can be explained within the frameworks of thermo-optic mechanism [Cseh et al. 2000, Biochemistry 39, 15250]: in high light the heat packages originating from dissipation might lead to elementary structural changes in the close vicinity of dissipation in heat-sensitive structural elements, e. g. around the site where PBS is anchored to the membrane. This, in turn, brings about a diminishment in the energy supply from PBS to the photosystems and reorganization in the molecular architecture of PBS...|$|R
40|$|Three {{building}} blocks of the antenna complexes of the cyanobacterium Westiellopsis prolifica were studied: PEC(X), {{which is similar to}} the α-subunit of phycoerythrocyanin (PEC), trimers of PEC and monomers derived from these by deaggregation with KSCN. The fit of the fluorescence decay curve of PEC(X) requires at least four exponentials, although it supposedly contains only one chromophore. The coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectra indicate that the heterogeneity observed is due to geometrical isomers, which are in part generated by photoinduced processes. A similar heterogeneity in chromophore structure and properties is also found in the monomers, where four exponentials are needed to fit the fluorescence decay curve. As in trimers, there is a long-lived, low-amplitude component, which can be assigned to impurities and/or oxidation products. The energy transfer time between the two phyocyanobilin chromophores in the β-subunit is about 500 ps; the lifetime of the fluorescing β-chromophore is 1. 5 ns. The phycoviolobilin chromophore in the α-subunit adopts different geometries characterized by fluorescence lifetimes of about 240 and 800 ps. No evidence was found for energy transfer between the α-chromophore and the β-chromophores. This energy transfer occurs in trimers on a time scale of less than 20 ps; the energy transfer time between the two different types of β-chromophore is about 250 ps and the lifetime of the <b>terminal</b> <b>emitter</b> is about 1. 5 ns. The excited state kinetics are therefore similar to those of PEC trimers from Mastigocladus laminosus, as are the CARS spectra, indicating a similar chromophore—protein arrangement. In comparison with phycocyanin, the ordering of the excited states of chromophores β 84 and β 155 may be changed. Although PEC trimers of Westiellopsis prolifica show almost as good a photostability as trimers of Mastigocladus laminosus, monomers are so photolabile that no CARS spectra could be recorded. ...|$|R
40|$|Cyanobacteria {{are able}} to {{regulate}} the distribution of absorbed light energy between photo systems 1 and 2 in response to light conditions. The mechanism of this regulation (the state transition) was investigated in the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002. Three cell types were used: the wild type, psaL mutant (deletion of a photo system 1 subunit thought {{to be involved in}} photo system 1 trimerization) and the apcD mutant (a deletion of a phycobilisome subunit thought to be responsible for energy transfer to photo system 1). Evidence from 77 K fluorescence emission spectroscopy, room temperature fluorescence and absorption cross-section measurements were used to determine a model of energy distribution from the phycobilisome and chlorophyll antennas in state 1 and state 2. The data confirm that in state 1 the phycobilisome is primarily attached to PS 2. In state 2, a portion of the phycobilisome absorbed light energy is redistributed to photo system 1. This energy is directly transferred to photo system 1 by one of the phycobilisome <b>terminal</b> <b>emitters,</b> the product of the apcD gene, rather than via the photo system 2 chlorophyll antenna by spillover (energy transfer between the photo system 2 and photo system 1 chlorophyll antenna). The data also show that energy absorbed by the photo system 2 chlorophyll antenna is redistributed to photo system 1 in state 2. This could occur in one of two ways; by spillover or in a way analogous to higher plants where a segment of the chlorophyll antenna is dissociated from photo system 2 and becomes part of the photo system 1 antenna. The presence of energy transfer between neighbouring photo system 2 antennae was determined at both the phycobilisome and chlorophyll level, in states 1 and 2. Increases in antenna absorption cross-section with increasing reaction center closure showed that there is energy transfer (connectivity) between photosystem 2 antennas. No significant difference was shown in the amount of connectivity under these four conditions...|$|R
40|$|La microirrigation est une {{technique}} dont l'uniformité de distribution d'eau par les goutteurs est très sensible aux faibles variations de pression. Pour maîtriser ces variations, avec davantage de précision, le présent travail est basé sur une analyse hydraulique approfondie de l'écoulement aboutissant à des équations différentielles aux dérivées partielles dont la pression et la vitesse de l'eau sont des inconnues. Ces équations non linéaires sont résolues en utilisant la méthode d'intégration Runge-Kutta d'ordre quatre. Les modèles développés dans la présente étude permettent de simuler la dynamique de l'eau dans la rampe et dans le réseau et sont utilisés pour déterminer le dimensionnement optimal du réseau. Les résultats obtenus corroborent ceux publiés par d'autres auteurs ayant utilisé la méthode des volumes de contrôle ou la méthode des éléments finis. Micro-irrigation {{is recommended}} for use in arid and semi-arid countries such as Algeria. This method consists of accurately providing {{the right amount of}} water and mineral nutrients to the plant's root area. The goal is to provide water efficiently by applying it at the correct rate. However, irrigation efficiency is clearly a function of the uniformity of water application. Micro-irrigation is a technique in which a delicate instrument known as an <b>emitter</b> (a <b>terminal</b> element of the network) operating with low pressure is used. The emitter, designed and manufactured with high precision, is a system with hydraulic laws and norms considered as a black box model that discharges water at atmospheric pressure. The emitter is an element of a network that constitutes a unit called a system or physical model. Water and mineral elements are delivered to a localized place, to the level of each plant by the emitters whose discharge is a function of lateral pressure. The precision of the dosage of irrigation, which must exactly satisfy the requirement for cultivation, depends fundamentally on the design of the network. It takes into account the pressure variations, which are due not only to head loss in the lateral branches of the network but also to the land slope and to the characteristics of the emitters. Water and air temperature and the possible plugging of the emitter orifice also influence the discharge of an emitter. The network is designed to satisfy the water needs of all the plants. Uniformity of water distribution is a main criterion for network design. To understand the variations in water distribution with more precision, we based the present work on a hydraulic analysis focussed on the outflow. This approach yields differential equations in which the pressure and the velocity of water in the pipeline network are unknown; the uniformity of water distribution is largely dependent on these variables. The differential second-order equations obtained are non-linear and analytical resolution is impossible, due to the empirical relation of the discharge emitter and the energy loss relation. Thus, the solution is obtained by numerical methods using the Runge Kutta integration method. The conditions in the limit equation modelling the outflow in the lateral pipes are different from those for the submain pipe. For the lateral pipes, the velocity of water at the extremity of the downstream region is inevitably minimal, as the whole region of discharge in the last pipe section is delivered by the last emitter where the pressure is minimal (Hmin). The velocity and pressure are calculated step by step along the lateral pipe until the entrance of water into the network where the pressure is maximal (Hsmax). The algorithm developed to simulate the emitter discharge distribution from the lateral pipes is called the "RK" model, and when it includes the discharge in the submain pipe it is called the "RS" model. These two models are transcribed in Fortran language by a computer program that automates iterations and calculations. Twelve parameters are changed in turn, or per group according to the cases studied, and the choice of the optimal solution of the parameters includes: emitter coefficients (a, y and Cvf); length and diameter of lateral pipes; the submain and main network (Lr, Dr, Ls, Ds, Lp, Dp); the roughness of the pipes (C); the spacing between the emitters (Δxr); the spacing between the lateral pipes (Δxs); and the water temperature. From these data of discharge and available pressure {{to the level of the}} parcel, the model precisely describes the distribution of the pressure and the discharges to all network emitters. In this case, the total discharge and the total required pressure, the uniformity of pressure and discharges are determined for each pattern of design. The combination of structural, functional and environmental factors is applied to guarantee an optimal exploitation taking into account the limits imposed by the specific norms for the micro-irrigation and the technical limits of velocity and pressure tolerance. Parameters that influence variations in uniformity are numerous and variable, which is why it is not easy to integrate them into this phase of study. The proposed model has merit as it avoids the complex numerical method of finite elements, recommended by some researchers (BRALTS et al., 1993; KANG and NISHIYAMA, 1994). The finite element method based on matrix structuring requires an important volume of iterations and calculations that could constitute a major constraint in the case of a large network. The model of BRALTS et al. (1993) is of particular interest in this regard; our results have been confronted with those obtained with their model. Thus, the models presented in this study permit the simulation of water dynamics in micro-irrigation networks and offer the opportunity to determine the optimal design for such networks. Optimization is based on the variation of twelve classical parameters plus the associated geometric structure of the network, which was shown to be a non-negligible parameter. Optimization would not only reduce irrigation water volumes, but also fertilizer use and pumping energy. The example illustrated in Table 4 shows that although the networks deliver the same total discharge and have some similar design characteristics, the consumption of pumping energy changes from one geometric structure to another. Once a network is installed, it is impossible to change its design, so it is important to assure precision of the design calculations. This work shows promise in the simulation of the optimal design of micro-irrigation networks and also constitutes an economic means of making decisions. Moreover, the modelling results can guide field experimentation to explore other methods. Micro-irrigation can potentially solve many water shortage problems, but it requires further research in the safe reuse of low quality water and wastewater, the development of long term sustainability and the minimization salt accumulation and drainage problems...|$|R
40|$|Anregungsenergietransfer-(EET) -prozesse wurden in verschiedenen photosynthetischen Pigment-Protein-Komplexen mit zeit- und wellenlängenkorrelierter Einzelphotonenspektroskopie (TWCSPC) analysiert. Ein neuer mobiler 16 -Kanal Photomultiplier mit flexibler Faseroptik, austauschbaren Lichtquellen und einem Kryostaten (10 K – 350 K) wurde für die Spektroskopie von Proben in Küvetten, auf Oberflächen oder von ganzen Blättern in vivo aufgebaut. Das System stellt einen mobilen Messplatz auf Grundlage der leistungsfähigen TCSPC Technik mit hohem Lichtdurchsatz bis zu 106 Photonen/ Sekunde dar. Die theoretische Beschreibung der Anregungszustandsdynamik unter Berücksichtigung von Pigment-Pigment und Pigment-Protein Wechselwirkung erfolgte über Ratengleichungen, die auf Systeme mit hierarchisch steigender Komplexität angewendet wurden. Die Untersuchung startete an einer Anordnung von zwei exzitonisch gekoppelten Chl Molekülen in einer tetrameren Proteinumgebung wie sie in rekombinantem wasserlöslichen Chlorophyll bindenden Protein (WSCP) des Typs IIa vorliegt und wurde mit einer Untersuchung der Photosystem II (PSII) Dynamik in ganzen Blättern der höheren Pflanze Arabidopsis thaliana abgeschlossen. Auf diese Weise wurde z. B. die Quantifizierung dissipativer Relaxationsprozesse der Anregungszustände bei ansteigender Intensität des Anregungslichtes ermöglicht. Für die Parameteranpassung in den entsprechenden Systemen linearer Differentialgleichungen wurde ein effizienter Algorithmus entwickelt, der die Variation von Parametern zur Anpassung der zeitaufgelösten optischen Daten unter beliebigen Randbedingungen an die Koeffizientenmatrix (z. B. Invarianz der Symmetrie) ermöglicht. Der Zugang erlaubt die Bestimmung ausgewählter Parameterwerte, ihre Wahrscheinlichkeit und Stabilität in einem beliebigen dynamischen System. Ein Weg zur Berechnung thermodynamischer Größen (z. B. Entropie) aus Ratengleichungen unter Nichtgleichgewichtsbedingungen wird vorgeschlagen. Die Anregungszustandsdynamik in WSCP wurde durch die Annahme eines gekoppelten Chl Dimers, das durch die Proteinumgebung auf verschiedenen Zeitskalen moduliert wird, erklärt. Die dominierende Komponente der Fluoreszenzkinetik steigt von 4, 8 bzw. 5, 2 ns für Chl b bzw. Chl a Homodimere bei Raumtemperatur auf 7, 0 bzw. 6, 2 ns bei 10 K an. Diese Temperaturabhängigkeit wird höchstwahrscheinlich durch die Pigment-Pigment Wechselwirkung und die energetische Lage der Triplettzustände der Chl Moleküle bestimmt. Eine Modulation der elektronischen Zustände durch die Proteinumgebung mit einer typischen Zeitkonstante von 100 ps bei 10 K ist sehr wahrscheinlich für eine schnelle und stark temperaturabhängige Fluoreszenzkomponente verantwortlich, die qualitativ mit weiterentwickelten theoretischen Modellen und Ergebnissen komplementärer Studien mittels Lochbrenn- und Fluoreszenz line {{narrowing}} Spektroskopie übereinstimmt. In der Phycobiliprotein (PBP) Antenne des Cyanobakteriums Acaryochloris marina findet der EET mit charakteristischen Zeitkonstanten von 400 fs, 3 - 5 ps bzw. 14 ps innerhalb des trimeren Phycocyanins (PC), vom PC zum Allophycocyanin (APC) bzw. vom APC zum terminalen Emitter (TE) der PBP Antenne statt. Die TWCSPC Spektren ganzer Zellen und Präparationen von isolierten PBP Komplexen zeigen jeweils eine 20 ps Komponente, die dem Anregungsenergietransfer vom PC zum TE entspricht, in Übereinstimmung mit Ergebnissen aus transienten fs absorptionsspektros-kopischen Untersuchungen. Der EET von der PBP Antenne zu den Chl d haltigen Komplexen der Core Antenne von PS II weist einen zusätzlichen limitierenden Transferschritt von 30 - 40 ps auf, der zu einer Zeitkonstante für den gesamten EET vom PBP zum Chl d in der Größenordnung von 70 ps führt. Gekoppelte und temperaturschaltbare Hybridsysteme aus oberflächenbehandelten CdSe/ZnS Quantenpunkte (QDs) mit 530 nm Emissionswellenlänge und isolierten PBP Komplexen aus A. marina wurden in wässriger Lösung durch elektrostatische Selbstorganisation gebildet. Nach der Theorie des Förster Resonanz Energietransfers (FRET) wurde der Abstand der benachbarten Übergangsdipolmomente in den QDs und der PBP Antenne zu 3, 2 - 3, 5 nm berechnet. Es wurde gezeigt, dass die funktionelle Kopplung von QDs und PBP Komplexen bei Temperaturen unterhalb von 0 °C unterbrochen wird. Dies ermöglicht die Konstruktion von schaltbaren molekularer Sonden, Photosensibilisatoren oder Lichtsammelsystemen mit vielfältigen Anwendungsfeldern in der Biochemie, Biomedizin und Photovoltaik. Excitation {{energy transfer}} (EET) processes in different photosynthetic pigment-protein-complexes were analysed by time- and wavelength correlated single photon counting (TWCSPC). A new mobile 16 -channel photomultiplier with flexible fiber optics, exchangeable light sources and temperature regulator (10 K – 350 K) was built {{up for the}} spectroscopy of samples in cuvettes, on surfaces or of whole leaves in vivo. The system represents a mobile setup of the powerful TCSPC technique with high optical throughput up to 106 counts/sec. The theoretical description of the excited state dynamics in systems with pigment-pigment and pigment-protein interaction was performed by using rate equations that were applied on structures with increasing hierarchical complexity. The study started with a system consisting of two excitonically coupled Chl molecules in a tetrameric protein environment represented by the recombinant water soluble Chl binding protein (WSCP) of type IIa and it was completed with {{a study of the}} photosystem II (PSII) dynamics in whole leaves of the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In this way a quantification of dissipative excited state relaxation processes as a function of increasing excitation light intensity was achieved. For parameter adaption in the corresponding systems of linear differential equations a highly efficient algorithm was developed that allows the variation of parameters used to fit the time resolved optical data under any constraints on the coefficient matrix (e. g. invariance of the symmetry). The approach permits the determination of selected parameter values, their probability and stability in any dynamical system. A way to calculate thermodynamic quantities (e. g. entropy) under nonequilibrium conditions from rate equations is proposed. The excited state dynamics observed in WSCP were explained by assuming an excitonically coupled Chl dimer that is modulated by the protein environment on different time scales. The dominating fluorescence decay component increases from 4. 8 ns or 5. 2 ns for Chl b or Chl a homodimers, respectively, at room temperature, to 7. 0 or 6. 2 ns, respectively, at 10 K. This temperature dependency is most probably caused by the pigment-pigment- interaction and the energies of the triplet states of the Chl molecules. A modulation of the electronic states of the coupled Chl dimer by the protein environment with a typical time constant of 100 ps at 10 K is inferred to be responsible for a fast and strongly temperature dependent fluorescence component. This idea is qualitatively in line with refined theoretical models and results of complementary studies of hole burning and fluorescence line narrowing spectroscopy. In the phycobiliprotein (PBP) antenna of the cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina EET occurs with characteristic time constants of 400 fs, 3 - 5 ps and 14 ps inside trimeric phycocyanin (PC), from PC to allophycocyanin (APC) and from APC to the <b>terminal</b> <b>emitter</b> (TE) of the PBP antenna, respectively. The TWCSPC spectra of whole cells and preparations of isolated PBP complexes exhibit a 20 ps component each that indicates the intact EET from PC to the TE in agreement with the results of transient fs absorption spectroscopy. The EET from the PBP antenna to the Chl d containing core antenna complexes of PS II represents an additional limiting transfer step of about 30 - 40 ps which leads to a time constant of the EET from PBP to Chl d in the range of 70 ps. Coupled and temperature switch-able hybrid systems of surface treated CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) with 530 nm emission wavelength and the isolated PBP antenna complexes from A. marina were formed in aqueous solution by electrostatic self assembly. Based on the theory of Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) an average value of 3. 2 - 3. 5 nm was obtained for the distance between the neighbouring transition dipole moments in the QDs and the PBP antenna. It was shown that the functional coupling between QDs and PBP complexes is interrupted at temperatures below 0 °C. This effect enables the construction of switch-able molecular sensors, photosensibilisators or light harvesting devices with various applications in biochemistry, biomedicine and photovoltaics...|$|R
40|$|In dieser Arbeit wurden die komplementären Techniken der Grundzustands Absorptionsspektroskopie, Messungen zeitaufgelöster fs Absorptionsänderungen, Lochbrennspektroskopie und Fluoreszenz line Narrowing Spektroskopie angewendet, um Anregungsenergietransfer- (EET) prozesse in den Phycobiliprotein (PBP) Antennensystemen des Cyanobakteriums Acaryochloris marina im Verleich zu Thermosynechococcus vulcan 7 us zu untersuchen. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass in A. marina ein neuer Pfad des EET vom Phycocyanin (PC) zum Allophycocyanin (APC) mit einer charakteristischen zeitkonstante von 14 ps existiert. Ein weiterer Einblick in das System offenbarte, dass das Exziton unterhalb von 624 nm lokalisiert ist, während der Anistropie Faktor Delokalisationseffekte oberhalb von 625 nm zeigt. Es wurde gezeigt, dass ein rotverschobenes Pigment bei 635 nm, welches den energetisch niedrigsten Zustand im PC darstellt, stark mit dem β 84 Pigment im PC gekoppelt ist, um den effizienten Energietransfer zum APC sicherzustellen. Das APC transportiert seine Anregungsenergie in den höchsten Zustand in der Linkermembran bei 657 – 665 nm. Es wurde gezeigt, dass das Linkerprotein ein APC Gen an der Bindungsstelle des APC_E aufweist und dieses ist stark gekoppelt an APC im letzten Heterohexamer. Der untere Zustand der Linkermembran ist vornehmlich ein APC_B gemäß seiner Spektralposition. Eine Studie der vibronischen zustände des PBP wird für spätere Vergleiche mit theoretischen Modellen gezeigt. In Thermosynechococcus vulcanus wurde ein ultrasschneller Energietransfer vom rod PC zum Kern APC gefunden, der mit einer Zeitkonstante von ~ 900 fs abläuft. Dieser ultraschnelle EET wird durch die Anwesenheit des Linkerproteins im rod PC und durch weitere Pigmente wie die beiden rotverschobenen Pigmente bei 635 nm und 645 nm induziert. Der Anteil dieser Arbeit besteht darin, dass gezeigt wurde, dass das beste Modell für das Phycobilisom (PBS) dasjenige von Adir 2008 ist. Um dieses Modell zu bestätigen zeigen wir, dass gegenüberstehende rod PCs {{parallel}} angeordnet sind, was zur exzitonischen Kopplung der β 155 Pigmente führt. Die starke Kopplung zwischen den Piugmenten entlang des rod PCs und des Kern APCs zeigt die steuernde Rolle des 645 nm Pigments und des 660 nm Pigments. Der niedrigste Zustand des PC wird bei 645 nm gefunden. Ein klares Ende der Wechselwirkung zwischen dem höchsten Zustand und dem niedrigeren Zustand der Linker Kern Membran zeigt sich mit typischen Zeitkonstanten von 450 fs und 13 ps, was einen schnelleren Pfad zum RC des PS II zeigt, als vorher angenommen wurde. In weiteren Untersuchungen wurde der EET im großen Lichtsammelkomplex LHC II höherer Pflanzen in Abhängigkeit vom Aggregationszustand untersucht, indem Beta-DM benutzt wurde. Es wurde gefunden, dass die schwache Aggregation der Trimerbildung im LHC II benötigt wird, um effizienten EET und Photoprotektion zu garantieren. Die exakte Psoition des löschenden Zentrums bleibt eine offene Frage. Die Studie wurde abgeschlossen durch die Analyse eines künstlichen photosynthetischen Systems, das aus der elektrostatischen Assemblierung von Chlorin dendrone (PaCD) mit dem Cytochrom C des Pferdeherzens (HCC) besteht. Es wurde gezeigt, dass das Design dieses künstlichen photosynthetischen Systems ein guter Kandidat für einen effizienten Energieztransfer in 30 ps und gleichzeitige Photoprotektion ist. The pathways of {{excitation energy}} transfer (EET) to photosynthetic reaction centres inside phycobiliprotein antenna system of Acaryochloris Marina (A. marina) were studied using time resolved absorption difference spectroscopy with a resolution time of 200 fs. The results revealed a new pathway of 14 ps inside the phycocyanin spectral band {{in addition to}} the previously known EET-equilibration pathway of all phycocyanins to allophycocyanin. This EET funnelling is faster than the previous kinetic found in phycobilisomes of 17 ps inside the phycocyanin (spectral range 600 - 630 nm) to allophycocyanin (640 - 650 nm). In addition, we present the result that excitonic coupling does not contribute to the EET inside the phycobiliprotein antenna system at room temperature. Anisotropy of the EET pathway was calculated to determine the contribution of excitonic coupling, which originated from the strong interaction between adjacent chromophores. This band is located between 624 nm to the final emitter 675 nm. In order to compare the results with those of the cyanobacterium containing phycobilisome and to address the functional role of the linker protein, further femtosecond flash induced transient absorption changes were monitored. This was done to obtain a time-resolved view of the excitation energy transfer in intact phycobilisomes of Thermosynechococcus vulcanus (T. vulcanus) having different linker proteins at room temperature. Ultrafast excitation energy transfer in phycobilisomes occurs along the phycocyanin rod shaped domain to the allophycocyanin core domain in two channels (i. e. 890 fs and 17 ps). The phycocyanin is assembly {{in the form of a}} rod of two PC hexamers separated by a distinct linker protein along the symmetry axis of the hexameric units, and an additional rod–core linker. In comparison to the absorbance of the phycobiliprotein antenna system of A. marina, the presence of the rod-core linker induces a 5 nm red shift on the rod spectrum. The kinetic component of 890 fs indicates that the presence of the linker proteins induces ultrafast EET inside the phycobilisome (PBS). Thus, we suggest that the PBP rod structure (with APC in the rod involving less pigment) of A. marina is not the reason of the ultrafast EET in comparison to the phycobilisomes. Furthermore, the absorbance of the phycocyanin rod (PC rod) sub-domain of phycobilisomes and PBP indicate that the high-energy sub-aggregate state of the PBP is likely to be influenced by different conformations. Further comparative study at low temperature by spectral hole burning (SHB) and fluorescence narrowing (FLN) revealed the existence of the inhomogeneous broadened distribution of local vibrational mode along the PBP antenna system of A. marina. In addition to the inhomogeneous broadened distribution of pure electronic frequencies in the spectra of the PBP antenna system, the presence of a blue shifted delocalized satellite hole along the rod is originated from different vibrations. The low amount of local vibrational frequencies in the PBS T. vulcanus leads to a high strength of pigment coupling which enhanced the ultrafast energy transfer. Thus, it is a coupling with the downhill energy transfer of the upper state towards a lower state. Additional information through FLN and SHB reveal the existence of new pigment absorbing at 635 nm in the PBP rod and 645 nm in the PBS as well as some similarity and difference on the <b>terminal</b> <b>emitter</b> spectral band. The similarity leads to an identification of two different pigments absorbing between 660 – 665 nm and 670 nm. The 660 – 665 nm pigment is an allophycocyanin (APC) pigments indentified by a 40 cm- 1 energy gap between α 84 and β 84, while the difference between the first vibrational mode and the red shift of wing supports the suggestion of a different APC gene. Due to the wavelength of the latter, it might be the apcB of the LCM. A further difference leads to excitonic contribution on the all-spectral band of the PBS T. vulcanus instead of the 624 nm to the final emitter 675 nm in the PBP of it case. In addition to the excitation energy transfer in cyanobacteria, time resolved absorption changes in the light harvesting complex II of higher plants (LHC II) were monitored. Aggregation state size was controlled by specific ß-DM concentration. The equilibrium time in each aggregation state was complemented by findings from the literature. Some information sources are listed as follows: • The aggregation state was observed where dependence of the relative maximum of the absorption state in time domain. • No significant change in the excited states was observed Further femto-second transient absorption spectroscopy at room temperature (RT) was applied to investigate the charge transfer process. This was done by photo-exciting ligand chlorine dendrone (PaCD) in different concentrated solutions of oxidant horse heart cytochrome c (Hccox) at 620 nm. After the HccoxPaCD was photo-excited, a delayed-bleach recovery signal at 550 nm was observed. This was due to the charge transfer from the excited state of the donor ligand PaCD to the acceptor state within about 30 ps. In the longer wavelength region above 620 nm, an excited state absorption signal originating from the PaCD was observed while a flash induced transient absorption signal was also observed at 667 nm. This was due to the excitation energy transfer (EET) produced from the 620 nm excitation to the 667 nm. The latter was followed by a red shift bleaching at 667 nm. The detailed analysis of the red shift bleaching at 667 nm indicates the quenching of excess EET originating from the ligand excited state band...|$|R
