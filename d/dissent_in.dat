5|$|From March to April 1999, there arose a huge {{groundswell of}} public <b>dissent</b> <b>in</b> the media over the National Library building's fate, {{as well as}} the drastic {{physical}} alterations of its environs. A number of featured columns by journalists touched on gradually disappearing heritage landmarks, as well as shared memories of Singaporeans.|$|E
5|$|Asser's Life omits {{any mention}} of {{internal}} strife or <b>dissent</b> <b>in</b> Alfred's own reign, though when he mentions that Alfred had to harshly punish those who were slow to obey Alfred's commands to fortify the realm, he {{makes it clear that}} Alfred did have to enforce obedience. Asser's life is a one-sided treatment of Alfred, though since Alfred was alive when it was composed, it is unlikely to contain gross errors of fact.|$|E
5|$|Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation {{have criticized}} the Debian project for hosting the non-free {{repository}} and because the contrib and non-free areas are easily accessible, an opinion echoed by some in Debian including the former project leader Wichert Akkerman. The internal <b>dissent</b> <b>in</b> the Debian project regarding the non-free section has persisted, but the last time {{it came to a}} vote in 2004, the majority decided to keep it.|$|E

25|$|Justices Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens, {{who both}} joined the {{plurality}} in part, also each filed opinions concurring in the Court's judgment <b>in</b> part and <b>dissenting</b> <b>in</b> part. Chief Justice William Rehnquist filed an opinion concurring in the Court's judgment <b>in</b> part and <b>dissenting</b> <b>in</b> part, which {{was joined by}} Justices Byron White, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas, none of whom joined {{any part of the}} plurality.

5|$|Sotomayor's {{first major}} written opinion was a <b>dissent</b> <b>in</b> the Berghuis v. Thompkins case dealing with Miranda rights. As {{her first year}} neared completion, Sotomayor said she felt swamped by the {{intensity}} and heavy workload of the job. During the oral arguments for National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Sotomayor showed her increasing familiarity with the Court and its protocols by directing the opening questions of the arguments to Donald Verrilli, the Solicitor General who was representing the government's position.|$|E
5|$|A case {{in which}} the Taft Court struck down {{regulation}} that generated a dissent from the chief justice was Adkins v. Children's Hospital. Congress had decreed a minimum wage for women in the District of Columbia. A 5–3 majority of the Supreme Court struck it down. Justice Sutherland wrote for the majority that the recently ratified Nineteenth Amendment, guaranteeing women the vote, meant that the sexes were equal when it came to bargaining power over working conditions; Taft, in dissent, deemed this unrealistic. Taft's <b>dissent</b> <b>in</b> Adkins was rare both because he authored few dissents, and because {{it was one of the}} few times he took an expansive view of the police power of the government.|$|E
5|$|Scalia took a broad {{view of the}} Eleventh Amendment, which bars certain {{lawsuits}} against states in the federal courts. In his 1989 <b>dissent</b> <b>in</b> Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., Scalia stated {{that there was no}} intent {{on the part of the}} framers to have the states surrender any sovereign immunity and that the case that provoked the Eleventh Amendment, Chisholm v. Georgia, came as a surprise to them. Professor Ralph Rossum, who wrote a survey of Scalia's constitutional views, suggests that the justice's view of the Eleventh Amendment was actually contradictory to the language of the Amendment.|$|E

5|$|Bømlo Municipal Council voted {{unanimously}} {{in favor of}} the Triangle Link on 22 February 1988. Two days later, the issue was discussed in Stord Municipal Council. Olav Akselsen at first proposed supporting the pontoon bridge, but after a trial vote he withdrew the proposal and also Stord supported the Triangle Link. The following week, Sveio Municipal Council voted in favor the Triangle Link, without either a debate or <b>dissent</b> <b>in</b> the council. Fitjar Municipal Council voted on 15 March to work with both proposals. Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a pontoon bridge, and stated that {{two and a half years}} of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for the Triangle Link was published in early 1989, estimating the costs at NOK890 million. It recommended that the Langevåg–Buavåg Ferry remain, but the other four ferry services be terminated. The report concluded that the maintenance costs of the fixed link would be lower than the subsidies of the ferry, that the project would be economical of society and would reduce emissions.|$|E
5|$|Conference Premier rivals York City made a £10,000 bid for Charles in June, {{which was}} {{subsequently}} rejected, with MyFootballClub members voting against the offer with over a 98% majority. Following this, York manager Martin Foyle {{said it was}} unlikely they would increase their offer for Charles. Ebbsfleet later agreed to sell Charles and striker Michael Gash for a combined fee of £80,000 to an unnamed club, which was revealed to be York and he {{was reported to have}} signed on 29 June 2009. However, the deal eventually fell through after Charles decided against joining the club as {{he did not want to}} relocate to York. Shortly after Ebbsfleet received an enquiry about him from an unnamed League Two club, although nothing came of this interest. He later became Ebbsfleet captain and was sent off for <b>dissent</b> <b>in</b> a 1–0 defeat to Tamworth on 21 November 2009. He made 42 appearances for Ebbsfleet during the 2009–10 as they were relegated to the Conference South.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} the book was written, Paraguay was under the {{dictatorship}} of Alfredo Stroessner, {{who went on to}} rule the country even longer than Francia did. Many consider the book to be at least in part a thinly disguised attack on Stroessner who used methods similar to Francia’s to achieve and maintain the effective control of the country, including the swift elimination of opposition, the employment of torture and intolerance of <b>dissent.</b> <b>In</b> its portrayal of Francia and criticism of Stroessner, I, the Supreme belongs to the genre of novelas de dictadores or dictator novels, and also to the Latin American Boom, a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The book was first published in Spanish in 1974, and in English (translation by Helen Lane) in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{appointed}} two Associate Justices to the Supreme Court. The first vacancy {{occurred when}} David Davis resigned {{to enter the}} Senate during the election controversy of 1876. On taking office, Hayes appointed John Marshall Harlan to the seat. A former candidate for governor of Kentucky, Harlan had been Benjamin Bristow's campaign manager at the 1876 Republican convention, and Hayes had earlier considered him for Attorney General. Hayes submitted the nomination in October 1877, but it aroused some <b>dissent</b> <b>in</b> the Senate because of Harlan's limited experience in public office. Harlan was nonetheless confirmed and served on the court for thirty-four years, in which he voted (usually in the minority) for an aggressive enforcement {{of the civil rights}} laws. In 1880, a second seat became vacant upon the resignation of Justice William Strong. Hayes nominated William Burnham Woods, a carpetbagger Republican circuit court judge from Alabama. Woods served six years on the Court, ultimately proving a disappointment to Hayes as he interpreted the Constitution in a manner more similar to that of Southern Democrats than to Hayes's own preferences.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Biko {{broke his}} banning order by {{travelling}} to Cape Town, hoping to meet Unity Movement leader Neville Alexander {{and deal with}} growing <b>dissent</b> <b>in</b> the Western Cape branch of the BCM, which was dominated by Marxists like Johnny Issel. Biko drove to the city with his Coloured friend Peter Jones on 17 August, but Alexander refused to meet with Biko, fearing {{that he was being}} monitored by the police. Biko and Jones drove back toward King William's Town, but on 18 August they were stopped at a police roadblock near Grahamstown. Biko was arrested for having violated the order restricting him to King William's Town. Unsubstantiated claims have been made that the security services were aware of Biko's trip to Cape Town and that the road block had been erected to catch him. Jones was also arrested at the roadblock; he was subsequently held without trial for 533 days, during which he was interrogated on numerous occasions.|$|E
5|$|The church faced {{internal}} <b>dissent</b> <b>in</b> 1991 {{over its}} decision to publish The Destiny of The Mother Church. Written and privately printed in 1943 by Bliss Knapp, {{former president of the}} Mother Church, the book suggested that Eddy was the Woman of the Apocalypse of the New Testament. Knapp and his family bequeathed $98 million to the church on condition that it publish and authorize the book by 1993; otherwise the money would go to Stanford University and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The church published and made the book available in Christian Science reading rooms. One senior employee was fired for failing to support the church's decision, and 18 of the 21 editorial staff of the religious journals resigned. In the end the other parties disputed that making the book available in Reading Rooms constituted authorization, and the bequest was split three ways.|$|E

5|$|The {{onset of}} World War II {{increased}} economic unrest in Guatemala. Ubico responded by cracking down more fiercely on {{any form of}} protest or <b>dissent.</b> <b>In</b> 1944, popular revolt broke out in neighboring El Salvador, which briefly toppled dictator Maximiliano Hernández Martínez. However, he quickly returned to power, leading to a flood of exiled El Salvadorian revolutionaries moving to Guatemala. This coincided {{with a series of}} protests at the university in Guatemala City. Ubico responded by suspending the constitution on 22 June 1944. The protesters, who by this point included many middle-class members in addition to students and workers, called for a general strike, and presented an ultimatum to Ubico the next day, demanding the reinstatement of the constitution. They also presented him a petition signed by 311 of the most prominent Guatemalan citizens. Ubico sent the police to disrupt the protests by firing on them, and declared martial law. Clashes between protesters and the military continued for a week, during which the revolt gained momentum. At the end of June, Ubico submitted his resignation to the National Assembly, leading to huge celebrations in the streets.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{never took}} place. Instead, the fighter force {{was committed to}} the disastrous Operation Bodenplatte, designed to support German forces during the Battle of the Bulge. Galland's influence on matters was now virtually nil. Appalled by the Ardennes losses, he personally confronted Gollob and criticised him severely. Gollob contacted the Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Himmler's reputation {{as the most powerful}} man after Hitler at that time may have been a prime motive. Gollob complained about his misuse in the Luftwaffe and Galland's leadership. The SS had already spread their influence into other areas of military affairs including the V-2 operations. Himmler, whose relationship with Göring was poor, took the opportunity to exploit the <b>dissent</b> <b>in</b> the Luftwaffe and undermine the Reichsmarschall by supporting Gollob. It was also an opportunity for the SS to seize control of the Luftwaffe and for Himmler to oust Göring from power. Göring, for his part offered no support to Galland when Himmler or the SS were mentioned. On 13 January 1945, Galland was finally relieved of his command.|$|E
5|$|England beat Argentina 1–0 in {{the last}} eight, with Geoff Hurst scoring with a header; the match was sullied by the first-half sending off of Argentinian midfielder Antonio Rattín, who refused to leave the pitch after being {{dismissed}} for <b>dissent.</b> <b>In</b> contrast to the previous games, the semi-final against Portugal {{proved to be a}} fair contest between two sides of talented players eager to attack {{from the start of the}} match. Yet there was panic in the buildup to the game as trainer Harold Shepherdson forgot to buy chewing gum, which Banks used to make his hands stickier and better able to handle the ball, and so Shepherdson had to run to a nearby newsagents to purchase gum as the teams were in the tunnel. Bobby Charlton scored two goals, but Portugal made a strong finish and won a penalty on 82 minutes after Jack Charlton handled the ball in the penalty area. Eusébio converted the penalty after sending Banks the wrong way, and the game finished 2–1 in England's favour. This was the first goal Banks had conceded for England in 721 minutes of regular play, since giving up Scotland's last goal after 81 minutes of the Home International clash in April. This remains a record for an England goalkeeper.|$|E

5|$|The {{political}} {{factions of}} the sejm were divided between liberals, supporting the German constitutional movement, and conservatives, like Edward Raczyński, who predicted that this movement would abolish the Grand Duchy's autonomy. During {{the two or}} so decades of its existence, the major issues of concern of the Sejm were the abolition of serfdom and relations between the inhabitants of Polish and German ethnicity, particularly the discrimination against the Poles by the Prussian government, which increasingly excluded the Polish majority from administration and judiciary. The last petition issued by the Sejm in 1841 demanded equal rights for the Poles and stopping of the Germanization campaign. As most of the Sejm petitions were simply ignored by the King of Prussia, this contributed to <b>dissent</b> <b>in</b> the province, which eventually resulted in an uprising in 1848 {{in the midst of}} the revolutions of 1848 in the German states. The Sejm met the total of seven times before the revolutions of 1848 (in 1827, 1830, 1834, 1837, 1841, 1843 and 1845). Following the revolutions, the Sejm of the Grand Duchy, like other provincial Prussian assemblies, gained the right to elect deputies to the Prussian Parliament. The Sejm continued its sessions till 1918, with a total of 49 Sejms being held.|$|E
5|$|To {{make matters}} worse for Aberhart, Minister of Lands and Mines Charles Cathmer Ross {{resigned}} late in 1936, followed by Provincial Treasurer Charles Cockroft on January29, 1937. Neither minister's resignation was {{directly related to the}} dissidents' complaints: Ross resigned over disagreements with Aberhart on oil policy, while Cockroft left over a combination of ill health, clashes with Aberhart over the issue of a federal-provincial loan council, government investment policies, and Aberhart's approach to patronage. Nevertheless, the resignations were the public's first clue of <b>dissent</b> <b>in</b> Social Credit's ranks. Cockroft's resignation was followed by that of his deputy, J. F. Perceval, and there were rumours that Hugill and Minister of Agriculture and Trade and Industry William Chant would soon follow. This left Minister of Health Wallace Warren Cross, Minister of Public Works and Railways and Telephones William Fallow, and Provincial Secretary Ernest Manning as Aberhart's only indisputably loyal ministers, and Manning was away from the legislature, ill with tuberculosis. On February19, William Carlos Ives of the Supreme Court of Alberta dealt the government another blow when he struck down key provincial legislation, including one act reducing the interest paid on the province's bonds by half (though this was only a technical defeat, since the government had been defaulting on its bond payments since the previous April).|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} Spanish playmaker Victor Vázquez in midfield at the {{beginning}} of the 2017 season saw less responsibility placed on Giovinco and captain Michael Bradley to create Toronto's goalscoring opportunities, and this in turn freed up the Italian, enabling him to focus more on his attacking game. Coach Greg Vanney also switched tactics from a 4–4–2 diamond to a 3–5–2 formation, benefiting Giovinco's and Altidore's attacking partnership by allowing them to play closer together, and with Vázquez supporting them as the team's main creator, the attacking duo began to demonstrate a deeper understanding and an increased awareness of each other's movements, which improved their link-up play, and saw an increase in Altidore's goalscoring output throughout the season. Giovinco scored his first goal of the season in a 2–2 home draw to expansion team Atlanta United, on 8 April 2017. On 27 June, Giovinco scored both goals in a 2–1 home win over Montreal in the 2017 Canadian Championship final second leg — edging Montreal 3–2 on aggregate; he also won the George Gross Memorial Trophy for the most valuable player of the tournament. On 30 July, Giovinco scored two goals and set up another in a 4–0 home win over New York City FC; his second goal of the match, which came from a free kick, was his 50th MLS goal, and his record-breaking 10th MLS goal from a free kick. While Giovinco was ruled out on injury, Toronto FC won the Supporters' Shield for most points in the league that season, following a 4–2 home win over New York Red Bulls on 30 September. In Toronto FC's last match of the regular season on 22 October, Giovinco scored from a free kick on his 100th appearance for the club in a 2–2 away draw to Atlanta; in doing so, Toronto FC broke the MLS regular season point record of 68 points, set by LA Galaxy in 1998, by one point. The goal was also Giovinco's sixth free kick goal of the season, which set the record for most free kicks scored in an MLS regular-season. On 30 October, in the first leg of the Eastern Conference Semi-finals in the 2017 MLS Cup Playoffs, Giovinco scored the match-winning goal from a free kick in a 2–1 away win over New York Red Bulls. Giovinco was subsequently included among the finalists for the 2017 MLS MVP award, after being omitted from the list of finalists for the award the previous season. On 5 November, in the second leg of the Eastern Conference Semi-finals, Giovinco received a booking for <b>dissent</b> <b>in</b> the 80th minute, causing his suspension for the Conference Finals as he also received a yellow in the first leg; Toronto lost the match 1–0 at home, but still advanced to the next round on away goals.|$|E
