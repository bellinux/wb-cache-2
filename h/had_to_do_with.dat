5|$|By lending his {{prestige}} to Kennan's position, {{the president}} tacitly signaled {{his intention to}} formulate the strategy of his administration {{within the framework of}} its predecessor's, despite the misgivings of some within the Republican Party.

The new president thus sought to minimize costs not by acting whenever and wherever the Soviets acted (a strategy designed to avoid risk) but rather whenever and wherever the United States could afford to act.|$|E
5|$|It {{remains unclear}} {{precisely}} why Steuart {{was reluctant to}} pursue Banks' defeated army more vigorously, and contemporary records shed little light on the matter. It may be that his thirteen years' training as a cavalry officer led him to obey orders to the letter, {{with little or no}} room for personal initiative or variation from strict due process. No charges were brought against him however, despite Jackson's reputation as a stern disciplinarian. It is possible that Jackson's leniency <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the strong desire of the Confederacy to recruit Marylanders to the Southern cause, and the need to avoid offending Marylanders who might be tempted to join Lee's army.|$|E

5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea.

5|$|The capsule {{built for}} the mission, Mercury Spacecraft No. 16, had been {{delivered}} to Cape Canaveral on January 16, 1962. The Atlas LV-3B booster assigned to the mission, No. 113-D, was accepted by NASA at the Convair plant on July 27 and delivered on August 8. In late July, the launch date was set for September 18, but delays with the Atlas booster's delivery {{and a series of}} technical concerns with the safety of the rocket motors caused it to be pushed back several weeks. Some of this <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the modified propulsion system, but also concern over Atlas ICBM tests earlier in the year. There had been no Atlas failures caused by the turbopumps for almost three years, but in late 1961-early 1962, two static firing tests experienced pump failure and explosion of the engine, followed by an Atlas missile in April 1962 that exploded almost immediately at liftoff due to a failure of the sustainer turbopump. Analysis of these incidents failed to locate any specific cause for the pump explosions, but all of them occurred when running untested hardware modifications and during movement of the sustainer inlet valve to the flight-ready open position. It was thus decided to give MA-8's booster a thorough checkout before it could be deemed flight-worthy. On September 6, the tests were scheduled to continue until September 24, which allowed for a probable launch on October 3. A static firing test on the pad would expose the sustainer turbopump to the failure mode in question. This was carried out on September 8 and the booster reported as ready for assembly on September 18.|$|E

With encouragement from Greenberg, Bush became closely tied to two movements that grew out of the efforts of the abstract expressionists: Color Field Painting and Lyrical Abstraction. His painting Big A is an example of his color field paintings of the late 1960s.|$|R

25|$|When Phillips {{arrived in}} China, medical {{practices}} contrasted with Western practice. Instead of scientific methods, Chinese medicine {{was made up}} of mostly traditional methods derived from ancient times. Diagnosing patients was much different in China, where doctors diagnosed patients from observing them from the outside rather than using tests to examine internal parts of the body that may need attention (ARTICLE). As for overall well being, the Chinese believed that it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a person’s internal harmony of yin and yang. The devil was blamed for all illness, but the real cause <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> poor standards of hygiene. Phillips encountered many herbal medications in China; herbal remedies and acupuncture were both very popular treatments around this time. She also noted the practice developed by the locals in which they would simply hop from doctor to doctor if one did not provide an immediate cure.|$|E

25|$|The Synod of Dort was {{convened in}} 1610 {{in order to}} decide a {{controversy}} between the followers of Jacobus Arminius (Arminians), and other Calvinists. One of the issues involved <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> {{the reason for the}} limitation of the efficacy of Christ's satisfaction for sin (roughly, atonement). Both sides of the controversy agreed that this efficacy was limited to the elect, and that the death of Christ was sufficient payment for the sin of the whole world. The disagreement <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the grounds for this limitation. For Arminius, the ground was the free choice of people to believe, foreknown by God, with God predestining people based on this foreseen faith. For the opponents of Arminius, whose views are represented in the Canons of Dort, this efficacy was limited based on God's predestination, without any foreknowledge of human choice. Calvin clearly taught this second view, and it is also the view of Reformed theologians following the Synod of Dort.|$|E
