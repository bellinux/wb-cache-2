25|$|First to {{the scene}} were 116 cadets under the {{direction}} of Lieutenant Commander H. J. Copeland from USS Nantucket, a training ship of the Massachusetts Nautical School (which is now the Massachusetts Maritime Academy), that was docked nearby at the playground pier. They ran several blocks toward the accident. They worked to keep the curious from <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the rescuers, while others entered into the knee-deep, sticky mess to pull out the survivors. Soon, the Boston Police, Red Cross, Army, and other Navy personnel arrived. Some nurses from the Red Cross dove into the molasses, while others tended to the injured, keeping them warm and keeping the exhausted workers fed. Many of these people worked through the night. The injured were so numerous that doctors and surgeons set up a makeshift hospital in a nearby building. Rescuers found it difficult to make their way through the syrup to help the victims. Four days elapsed before they stopped searching for victims; many of the dead were so glazed over in molasses, they were hard to recognize.|$|E

500|$|Dylan {{had married}} Sara Lownds in November 1965. By {{the time the}} {{basement}} sessions started in Big Pink around June 1967, he had two children: Maria (Sara's daughter from her first marriage) and Jesse Dylan.

Both Heylin and biographer Sid Griffin suggest that recording had to move from Dylan's home to Big Pink {{when it became clear}} that the sessions were <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> family life.

[...] Meanwhile, Evans has an extramarital affair with Australian Democrats leader Cheryl Kernot (typically played by a male) ("Heavens, Mister Evans"). [...] In an understated minor-key bossa nova song, Keating sings of the need to recognise and apologise for the damage done by white colonisation and subsequent subjugation of the Australian Aboriginal population ("Redfern"), before segueing into a more upbeat mambo about the Mabo decision by the High Court of Australia and his attempts to use the decision to promote a reconciliation agenda ("Ma(m)bo").|$|E

Goudas praised Dickson, noting that, [...] "Y flourishes when her character takes center stage." [...] Jillian Bowe of Zap2it {{was critical of}} Dickson's portrayal, stating: [...] "When contemplating the four decades of feuding between Genoa City’s grande dame Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and hellcat [...] on The Young and the Restless, cartoon characters don't necessarily spring to mind — okay, maybe during the Brenda Dickson years." [...] Jamey Giddens, also of Zap2it, described her portrayal as [...] "cheesetastic".

She's very competitive but does have a sense of self, so she doesn't need to win all the time." [...] At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> O'Malley and Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s relationship.

Rhimes stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry, and watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to.

500|$|The {{visits to}} Europe continued. Farmer moved there in 1968 and {{ultimately}} settled in Vienna, where he performed with The Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band {{and joined the}} Austrian Radio Orchestra. The latter job initially required only ten days a month of his time, so {{he was able to}} play with other well-known expatriates such as Don Byas, Dexter Gordon, and Ben Webster. As the orchestra's music gradually changed in style from jazz to simpler forms and took up more of Farmer's time, he found that it was <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> his musical ambitions, so he left after three or four years. Pursuing these ambitions meant that Farmer traveled extensively worldwide. He said in 1976 that [...] "I'm traveling 90 percent of the time. I can live anywhere. It's just a matter of getting to the airport". A 1982 revival of the Jazztet, with Golson, led him to play more frequently in the United States than he had over the previous decade. In the 1980s Farmer also created a quintet, featuring saxophonist Clifford Jordan, that toured internationally. In the early 1980s, Farmer had also made some changes to his lifestyle. Interviewed for a 1985 article in The New Yorker, he reported losing 30 pounds in weight a couple of years earlier, and stopping smoking and drinking {{a couple of years before}} that; Farmer [...] "used to think he couldn't play without drinking; now he couldn't play and drink", was the interviewer's summary of Farmer's habits, which appear to have avoided the drug-related problems of many of his contemporaries.|$|E

Pitchfork Media critic Jordan Sargent praised the song, and wrote [...] "this isn't a tale of bedroom triumph; instead it's a beguiling sketch of a relationship just out of his reach.

500|$|Despite having {{turned into}} a highly {{proficient}} band on stage, things were starting to heat up internally, with band members getting more vocal about the direction they wanted the music to go, {{as well as being}} dissatisfied with their treatment financially. Founding members Lord and Blackmore were tired of being identified as a [...] "clone of Vanilla Fudge" [...] and were starting to yearn for a sharper, rawer and overall heavier sound, similar to that introduced in Led Zeppelin's debut album, which had become a great success {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, after its release in January 1969. They felt that Rod Evans, with his tender, smooth voice, would not be able to cope with louder, more aggressive material. Evans had also expressed reservations about his permanence in the band and voiced his wish to permanently move to the US. Tensions were also high with bassist Nick Simper, whose playing style was considered, in Paice's words, [...] "stuck in the late '50s and early '60s" [...] by the other band members and unfit for the new musical direction they wanted to pursue. On the other hand, Simper sided with Blackmore against Lord's excessive influence in the band's songwriting and was critical of classical music <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> harder rock. As a result of those tensions, communication between band members was at a minimum during the tour. It was in May that Lord and Blackmore agreed on changing the line-up, shifting out Evans. They talked their ideas over with drummer Paice, gaining his agreement to the line-up change. Coletta was surprised when he heard the trio's news, advising them to keep quiet about it until the tour was completed and they had returned home.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{characters}} were separated on screen, they had gained a fan {{base on the}} Internet that believed Martha should be with Jack and wanted the pair to reunite.

Jack's in a relationship with someone else as Martha is, there just seems to be things <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> them getting back together all the time." [...] Gordon also hoped for a happy ending for the two characters if they were to ever leave the serial adding: [...] "If I had it my way, and I got to write the scripts then I'd make it happily ever after, Martha and Jack riding off into the sunset." [...] Gordon has spoken of her understanding from the audiences point of view, that together Jack and Martha are [...] "the ultimate couple". She also reiterated her belief that it would be to tough at the time of Martha's downward spiral for them to work together, but if Martha is to get through her troubles and have a happy ending, that it would be with Jack. The Daily Telegraph commented on the Martha and Jack situation, saying it is played out in a [...] "classic soapie technique". They said [...] "Bring {{the characters}} together, push them apart, but always leave open the possibility that they could get back together.

500|$|The {{season was}} {{primarily}} filmed in Los Angeles, California. Fisher Plaza, {{which is the}} headquarters building for the media company Fisher Communications and Fisher's ABC affiliated Komo radio and television stations for Seattle, is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, such as air ambulances landing on the Komo Television newscopter's helipad. This puts Seattle Grace conveniently close to the Space Needle, which is {{directly across the street}} from Fisher Plaza, the Seattle Monorail, and other local landmarks. However, the hospital used for most other exterior and many interior shots is not in Seattle, are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills, California. Most scenes are primarily taped in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, at the Prospect Studios, and the set occupies two stages, including the hospital pieces, but some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle. Several props used are genuine medical supplies, including the MRI machine. Prior to being cast, Sara Ramirez was seen by ABC executives, in her Broadway performance of Spamalot, which garnered their attention. Due to their admiration, the network offered Ramirez a role on any ABC television series, of her choice, which ultimately led in her choosing Grey's Anatomy. Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition, the producers liked her, and had intentions to add her to the show, but did not know who to cast her as. She also said she was in awe of how the executives said, [...] "Pick a show, any show", a statement she deemed rare. Ramirez's character was given recurring status in the second season, having been conceived as a love interest for George O'Malley. At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> O'Malley and Grey's relationship. When asked of this, Torres said: [...] "You do run across {{a lot of people who}} are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] Discussing Izzie Stevens' relationship with Alex Karev, Katherine Heigl described her character as naive enough to believe she can save him, assessing that: [...] "Even when Alex was a complete dirtbag to her, she forgave him and gave him another chance. And he really screwed her over." [...] Writer Stacy McKee described Izzie's moving on from Alex to patient Denny Duquette as [...] "karma", as Alex previously treated Izzie badly, yet as he begins to realize his true feelings, he is forced to watch her embark on a romance with Denny, regarded by her as [...] "undeniably handsome and totally charming". Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny: [...] "I love the way Izzie lights up when she’s around him. I love their relationship because it's so pure and honest and completely game free." [...] Writer Elizabeth Klaviter noted at this time the way Izzie [...] "seems to be sacrificing her reputation because of her feelings for Denny." [...] When Izzie deliberately worsened Denny's condition to move him up the transplant list, series writer Mark Wilding questioned the morality of the actions, asking: [...] "Is Izzie bad for doing it? Is she tremendously irresponsible? She cut the wire for love so does that make her action understandable?" [...] Series creator Shonda Rhimes discussed costuming choices in the scene which saw the interns gather around Denny's deathbed, explaining: [...] "Meredith and George and Cristina and Callie and Alex are all dressed, not for a prom, but for a funeral. Everyone in dark colors, everyone dressed somberly. As if they were in mourning. Only Izzie is in happy pink. Only Izzie looks like she didn't know this was coming." ...|$|E
