5|$|Jamestown is {{the capital}} of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, located on the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is also the {{historic}} main settlement of the island and is on its north-western coast. It is the island's only port and the centre of the island's road and communications network. It was founded when colonists from the English <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> settled on the island in 1659 and was briefly occupied by the Dutch <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> in 1673 before being recaptured. Many of the buildings built by the <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> in the 1700s survive and give the town its distinctive Georgian flavour.|$|E
5|$|Jamestown {{was founded}} in 1659 by the English <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> and named after James, Duke of York, the future King James II of England. A fort, {{originally}} named the Castle of St John, was quickly built and, with {{the restoration of the}} monarchy in 1660, the fort was renamed James Fort, the town Jamestown and the valley James Valley. The fort and associated gun batteries dominated James Bay and were sporadically improved over the years. In January 1673 the Dutch <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> briefly seized control of the island until the English <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> recaptured it in May. Since then the town has been continuously inhabited under English and then British rule.|$|E

50|$|In 1857, a {{group of}} {{indigenous}} soldiers mutinied against the <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company's</b> army and in turn the British control over India. The mutiny, the Sepoy Rebellion, had many causes, and was eventually thwarted by the British in 1858. The result of the rebellion left doubts over the <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company's</b> ability to govern their territories. In September 1858, the British government seized control of the <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company's</b> territories, and it was decided amicably that control of the territories in question should {{be transferred to the}} crown.|$|R

In 1763, the British <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> assumed {{indirect}} control from the Nawab of the Carnatic over the erstwhile Chingleput District, comprising the present-day Kanchipuram and Tiruvallur districts, in order to defray the expenses of the Carnatic wars. The Company brought the territory under their direct control during the Second Anglo-Mysore War, and the Collectorate of Chingleput was created in 1794. The district was split into two in 1997 and Kanchipuram made the capital of the newly created Kanchipuram district.|$|E

5|$|Several European traders {{reached this}} area {{late in the}} 15thcentury. The British <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> {{defeated}} Siraj ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab, in the Battle of Plassey in 1757. The company gained the right to collect revenue in Bengal subah (province) in 1765 with {{the signing of the}} treaty between the <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>company</b> and the Mughal emperor following the Battle of Buxar in 1764. The Bengal Presidency was established in 1765; it later incorporated all British-controlled territory north of the Central Provinces (now Madhya Pradesh), from the mouths of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra to the Himalayas and the Punjab. The Bengal famine of 1770 claimed millions of lives due to tax policies enacted by the British company. Calcutta, the headquarters of the <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>company,</b> was named in 1772 as the capital of British-held territories in India. The failed Indian rebellion of 1857 started near Calcutta and resulted in a transfer of authority to the British Crown, administered by the Viceroy of India.|$|E
5|$|The Nassak Diamond quickly resurfaced in the {{possession}} of Baji Rao II the last independent Indian Peshwa Prince, who handed over the diamond to an English colonel named J. Briggs. In turn, Briggs delivered the diamond to Francis Rawdon-Hastings, the 1st Marquess of Hastings who had conducted the military operations against the Peshwa. Rawdon-Hastings delivered the diamond to the <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> as part of the spoils of the Maratha war. The <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> then sent the Nassak Diamond to England, to be sold on the London diamond market in 1818.|$|E
5|$|The Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817–1818) was {{the final}} and decisive {{conflict}} between the British <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> (EIC) and the Hindu Maratha Empire in India.

It began with an invasion of the Hindu Maratha territory by British <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> troops, the largest such British controlled force massed in India. The troops were led by the Governor General Hastings (no relation to Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General of Bengal) supported by a force under General Thomas Hislop. Operations began against the Pindaris, a band of Mercenaries and Marathas from central India.|$|E

5|$|Tod {{was born}} in London and educated in Scotland. He joined the <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> as a {{military}} officer and travelled to India in 1799 as a cadet in the Bengal Army. He rose quickly in rank, eventually becoming captain of an escort for an envoy in a Sindian royal court. After the Third Anglo-Maratha War, during which Tod {{was involved in the}} intelligence department, he was appointed Political Agent for some areas of Rajputana. His task was to help unify the region {{under the control of the}} <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company.</b> During this period Tod conducted most of the research that he would later publish. Tod was initially successful in his official role, but his methods were questioned by other members of the <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company.</b> Over time, his work was restricted and his areas of oversight were significantly curtailed. In 1823, owing to declining health and reputation, Tod resigned his post as Political Agent and returned to England.|$|E
5|$|With {{the defeat}} of the Nawab of Bengal at the Battle of Buxar in 1764, British <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>company</b> gained the right to collect taxes from the Mughal {{province}} of Bengal-Bihar. The city formally passed to the control of the British <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> in 1793 and Dhaka got plugged into the imperial mercantile networks of the British Empire. With the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain, Dhaka became a leading centre of the jute trade, as Bengal accounted for the largest share of the world's jute production.|$|E

5|$|Hyder Ali, the {{de facto}} ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, conquered Mangalore in 1763, {{consequently}} bringing the city under his administration until 1767. Mangalore was ruled by the British <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> from 1767 to 1783, but was subsequently wrested from their control in 1783 by Hyder Ali's son, Tipu Sultan; who renamed it Jalalabad. The Second Anglo–Mysore War ended with the Treaty of Mangalore, signed between Tipu Sultan and the British <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> on 11 March 1784. After the defeat of Tipu at the Fourth Anglo–Mysore War, the city remained {{in control of the}} British, headquartering the South Canara district under the Madras Presidency.|$|E
5|$|In 1712, the British {{completed}} {{the construction of}} Fort William, located on the east bank of the Hooghly River to protect their trading factory. Facing frequent skirmishes with French forces, the British began to upgrade their fortifications in 1756. The Nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud-Daulah, condemned the militarisation and tax evasion by the company. His warning went unheeded, and the Nawab attacked; he captured Fort William {{which led to the}} killings of several <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>company</b> officials in the Black Hole of Calcutta. A force of Company soldiers (sepoys) and British troops led by Robert Clive recaptured the city the following year. Per the 1765 Treaty of Allahabad following the battle of Buxar, <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>company</b> was appointed imperial tax collector of the Mughal emperor in the province of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, while Mughal-appointed Nawabs continued to rule the province. Declared a presidency city, Calcutta became the headquarters of the <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> by 1772. In 1793, ruling power of the Nawabs were abolished and <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>company</b> took complete control {{of the city and the}} province. In the early 19th century, the marshes surrounding the city were drained; the government area was laid out along the banks of the Hooghly River. Richard Wellesley, Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William between 1797 and 1805, was largely responsible for the development of the city and its public architecture. Throughout the late 18th and 19th century, the city was a centre of the East India Company's opium trade.|$|E

5|$|In May 1773, the British Parliament {{passed the}} Tea Act, a tax law {{to help the}} {{struggling}} <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company,</b> one of Great Britain's most important commercial institutions. Britons could buy smuggled Dutch tea more cheaply than the East India Company's tea because of the heavy taxes imposed on tea imported into Great Britain, and so the company amassed a huge surplus of tea {{that it could not}} sell. The British government's solution to the problem was to sell the surplus in the colonies. The Tea Act permitted the <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> to export tea directly to the colonies for the first time, bypassing most of the merchants who had previously acted as middlemen. This measure was a threat to the American colonial economy because it granted the Tea Company a significant cost advantage over local tea merchants and even local tea smugglers, driving them out of business. The act also reduced the taxes on tea paid by the company in Britain, but kept the controversial Townshend duty on tea imported in the colonies. A few merchants in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Charlestown were selected to receive the company's tea for resale. In late 1773, seven ships were sent to the colonies carrying <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> tea, including four bound for Boston.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the three villages that predated Calcutta were {{ruled by the}} Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty. After the Nawab granted the <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> a trading licence in 1690, the area was {{developed}} by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post. Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756, and the <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>Company</b> retook it the following year. In 1793 the <b>East</b> <b>India</b> <b>company</b> was strong enough to abolish Nizamat (local rule), and assumed full sovereignty of the region. Under the company rule, and later under the British Raj, Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 1911, when its perceived geographical disadvantages, combined with growing nationalism in Bengal, led to a shift of the capital to New Delhi. Calcutta was the centre for the Indian independence movement; it remains a hotbed of contemporary state politics. Following Indian independence in 1947, Kolkata, which was once the centre of modern Indian education, science, culture, and politics, suffered several decades of economic stagnation.|$|E
