25|$|Clear Lake and Lake Audy have boat launches, both {{of which}} can be used for {{motorized}} boats. Moon Lake can also be used for this purpose though equipment must be carried 300 metres. On Whirlpool Lake, Deep Lake, Lake Katherine, and back-country lakes, only non-motorized boats can be used. All personal water crafts are banned within Riding Mountain National Park. As of 2008, only four-stroke and direct injected two-stroke <b>equipped</b> <b>motor</b> boats will be permitted on Clear Lake. Boats equipped with other motors are not permitted to use the lake for environmental reasons. The ban is enforced by Parks Canada and the RCMP.|$|E
50|$|The {{anti-tank}} {{platoon of}} a Soviet BTR <b>equipped</b> <b>motor</b> rifle battalion had two (sometimes three) ATGM squads, each with two 9K111 Fagot teams. The team {{consisted of three}} men; the gunner carries the 9P135 launcher and tripod as a back pack, {{and the other two}} men each carry two launch tubes. The men also carry assault rifles, but do not carry an RPG, because unlike the earlier missiles there is only a small deadzone within which the missile cannot engage the target. Besides the four missiles carried by each team, each squad would normally have an extra eight missiles carried in their transport, usually a BTR. It can also be deployed from the BMP-1P, BMD-1P, BTR-D and UAZ-469.|$|E
40|$|Use of {{inverter}} drive for rotating machines speed control {{leads to the}} application of new stress on stator insulation materials. The integrity of these materials under such stresses has therefore to be studied. Thanks to specially <b>equipped</b> <b>motor,</b> the different voltage shapes have been identified. Very short rise time fronts, large overvoltages and high oscillation frequencies are obtained. These voltages are then reproduced on laboratory samples (Polyethylene Terephtalate). The main result is the existence of trapped surface charges related both to the rise front value and {{to the existence of}} polar mechanisms in the material bulk. The consequences of this surface charge existence on the reliability of a real system are then discussed. ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{neighbouring}} stations at Brixham and [...] were <b>equipped</b> with <b>motor</b> lifeboats in 1922 and 1926 respectively. It {{was thought}} that this {{would allow them to}} cover larger areas and so Salcombe was closed in 1925. The closure proved ill-advised and so a station was reopened at Salcombe in December 1930, itself <b>equipped</b> with a <b>motor</b> lifeboat. Crew facilities were placed in the Unity Building on the quay. This was refurbished in 1992 and now includes a museum and display area.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem that}} needs to be {{addressed}} is the 58 percent immunity level among 2 -year-olds in southeastern Idaho, a level created by the indifference or fear of parents. Southeastern Idaho has the highest birth rate of any region in the State, and this situation has created a large group of children susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases. The mobile unit, which consists of a specially <b>equipped</b> <b>motor</b> home, allows easy access to immunizations for groups of children and their parents. A search of the computerized record system installed in the mobile unit can provide data on past immunizations for each registered child. The target audience for the mobile unit's visits is church groups because of the particular cultural demographics of this region. In 1987, the District Seven Health Department, a State- and county-funded agency, expects to increase the number of doses of vaccine given by 3, 000 over the 19, 953 given in 1986. The "Shots for Tots" program is unique in the State of Idaho. Its expansion may be anticipated as the unit becomes better known in the region. The alternative to using aggressive, innovative techniques to motivate people to become immunized is disease...|$|E

50|$|Daryll Thomann (born 1941) was the Chief of Police for {{the city}} of Placentia in Orange County, California. He joined the {{department}} in 1969 as a patrol officer, then oversaw investigations for most of his career. He became acting chief in 1996, during a period of internal turmoil in the department, centering on his predecessor. In 1997, he became the department's chief, overseeing more than 50 officers and about 20 other employees. He held a Masters Degree in Management, and began his tenure of chief with efforts to build up his department's Professional Standards Bureau, including efforts to supplement the department's funding with grant writing. In 1998, he launched his county's first police department program of <b>equipping</b> <b>motor</b> and patrol vehicles with automated external defibrillators, which improved response times to cardiac arrest victims, the survival window of cardiac victims being less than seven minutes for administration of defibrillation equipment, with a victim's chance of survival decreasing by 10 percent each minute, and brain damage after 4 to 6 minutes. He was active with the Placentia's Rotary Club and Chamber of Commerce.|$|R
50|$|While {{sea fish}} {{production}} in Lebanon {{is compared to}} that of neighboring countries on a km of coastline basis, freshwater fish production continues to lag behind. Absence of sea fish breeding along the coast due to strong coastal currents have been substituted by offshore fishing of pelagic fish (such as Tuna, Blue fish, etc.) using draglines. This type of fishing has become trendy in the past decade, mostly among sports amateurs <b>equipped</b> with <b>motor</b> speedboats.|$|R

2500|$|Variable autotransformers (trade name [...] "Variac") {{were then}} introduced. While {{they were still}} nearly as large as {{rheostat}} dimmers, they were relatively efficient devices. Their voltage output, and so their dimming effect, was largely {{independent of the load}} applied so it was far easier to design the lighting that would be attached to each autotransformer channel. Remote control of the dimmers was still impractical, although some dimmers were <b>equipped</b> with <b>motor</b> drives that could slowly and steadily reduce or increase the brightness of the attached lamps. Autotransformers have fallen out of use for lighting [...] but are used for other applications.|$|R

50|$|The twenty {{cars from}} Stephenson arrived in December 1902. Fifteen cars were <b>equipped</b> with <b>motors</b> (even numbers 30-58) and five did not (odd numbers 101-109); these latter five cars were {{intended}} to only be used as trailing cars. Trailing cars would often be added or removed at Wheaton depending {{on the number of}} passengers. The Stephenson cars were almost identical in every respect to the Niles cars. These new cars reduced the travel time between Aurora and Chicago to one hour. The new cars also allowed the railroad to operate at faster speeds—one run from 52nd Avenue to Aurora averaged 65 mph.|$|R
