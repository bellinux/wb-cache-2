Several road scenarios and interventions considering the possible behavioural influence are considered and proposed.|$|R

40|$|Summary. We have {{developed}} a method that utilizes hypertext link information in image retrieval from the World Wide Web. The basis of the method consists {{of a set of}} basic relations that can take place between two images in the Web. Our method uses the SHA- 1 message digest algorithm for dimension reduction by random mapping. The Web link features have then been used in creating a Self-Organizing Map of images in the Web. The method has been effectively tested with our PicSOM content-based image retrieval system using a Web image database containing over a million images. The method can as such be used also <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>Web</b> applications not related to content-based image retrieval. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to decoupling Web frameworks and Web servers, OWIN allows chaining together middleware into a pipeline. A Web framework can interact with OWIN without knowing {{whether it is}} interacting directly with the underlying web server, or {{with one or more}} layers of middleware (each implementing OWIN) on top of the Web server. This allows infrastructure concerns, such as authentication, to be split out into separate modules. This is desirable as it decouples them from the application's own code, and makes them reusable across applications. In Project Katana, Microsoft has made into OWIN modules several ASP.NET features that were previously part of the core ASP.NET framework. This allows them to be reused <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>Web</b> frameworks, and also ensures a cleaner separation from the application using them.|$|R
