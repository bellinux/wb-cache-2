Speaking of her return, Gillian Taylforth said: [...] "When Dominic [...] approached {{me with his}} plan, I was so shocked I got <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>car</b> and burst into tears! 'Kathy' has always been so close to my heart and it's absolutely wonderful returning to the show and reprising the role." [...] It was then confirmed that Taylforth would reprise her role indefinitely. While Taylforth was initially only contracted to the series for six months, she said that she'd love {{to stay on the}} series for good. Of the return, Treadwell-Collins said [...] "Six months ago, we set ourselves that challenge of bringing Kathy back to the Square in a credible way. And I believe we have succeeded." [...] Taylforth revealed that she was initially hesitant about the storyline. [...] "I couldn't understand how they could work around the fact that she could do that to her children" [...] the actress explained. Taylforth said [...] "it had to be right." [...] In September 2015, Treadwell-Collins revealed to the Daily Mirror that the story was inspired by the real life John Darwin disappearance where John—also known as the Canoe man—with the help of his wife Anne faked his death in a canoe accident in March 2002 in order to claim the insurance. Kathy's husband Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas) had convinced her to fake her death to keep her children safe.|$|E
6000|$|STRAKER. [after {{a moment}} of stupefaction at the old man's {{readiness}} in repartee] Look here: {{what do you mean}} by gittin <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>car</b> and lettin me bring you here if you're not the person I took that note to? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>car</b> at once," [...] she directed. [...] "I'll {{drive you}} to a chemist's and put {{something}} on that. You can't go about as you are, and it will have healed up then {{in a day or}} two." ...|$|E
60|$|But her {{sparkling}} eyes {{gave the}} lie to her words. Like {{the rest of}} us, she was enjoying it hugely. Quite an adventure it was, getting those candles. It was not until we went across the city and down into the working-class quarter south of Market Street that we found small corner groceries {{that had not yet}} sold out. Miss Chickering thought one box was sufficient, but I persuaded her <b>into</b> taking four. <b>My</b> <b>car</b> was large, and I laid in a dozen boxes. There was no telling what delays might arise in the settlement of the strike. Also, I filled the car with sacks of flour, baking-powder, tinned goods, and all the ordinary necessaries of life suggested by Harmmed, who fussed around and clucked over the purchases like an anxious old hen.|$|R
5000|$|Numerous {{accounts}} of conditions inside the institutions {{have made their}} way into Western media and human rights groups reports. For example, one 46-year-old former detainee from Jiangsu province, who spent more than a month in a black jail, [...] "cried with fear and frustration as she recalled her abduction. abductors are inhuman...two people dragged me by the hair and put me <b>into</b> the <b>car.</b> <b>My</b> two hands were tied up and I couldn't move. Then arriving back in Jiangsu they put me inside a room where there were two women who stripped me of my clothes...and beat my head and used their feet to stomp my body," [...] the former detainee said.|$|R

6000|$|... "Your {{association}} with this ridiculous escapade," [...] he continued, [...] "has decided me to {{regard it as}} a practical joke,--on one condition: which is that you step <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>car</b> there, allow my man to drive you to your rooms, or wherever you are staying, and promise me to have nothing whatever {{more to do with}} this gang of adventurers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure. Well, I didn't {{want him}} to miss the train, so I picked up the nearest thing. It was a nice little box that flew open, and I thought it had a clock in it. He got <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>car</b> and began to {{apologize}} in very good English, and then I asked him {{what was in the}} box. I thought he hesitated, but he showed me that it was a compass, with a brass thing that turned around its top and had two little slits for looking through." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the morning}} of the 21st we took the train for the front, {{reaching}} Stevenson Alabama, after dark. Rosecrans was there on his way north. He came <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>car</b> and we held a brief interview, in which he described very clearly the situation at Chattanooga, and made some excellent suggestions as to what should be done. My only wonder was that he had not carried them out. We then proceeded to Bridgeport, where we stopped for the night. From here we took horses and made our way by Jasper and over Waldron's Ridge to Chattanooga. There had been much rain, and the roads were almost impassable from mud, knee-deep in places, and from wash-outs on the mountain sides. I had been on crutches since the time of my fall in New Orleans, and had to be carried over places where it was not safe to cross on horseback. The roads were strewn with the debris of broken wagons and the carcasses of thousands of starved mules and horses. At Jasper, some ten or twelve miles from Bridgeport, there was a halt. General O. O. Howard had his headquarters there. From this point I telegraphed Burnside to make every effort to secure five hundred rounds of ammunition for his artillery and small-arms. We stopped for the night at a little hamlet some ten or twelve miles farther on. The next day we reached Chattanooga a little before dark. I went directly to General Thomas's headquarters, and remaining there a few days, until I could establish my own.|$|E
50|$|The {{questions}} {{also just}} happen, where if I’m in <b>my</b> <b>car,</b> you know, someone might cut me off, and I’ll think, “What’s {{the worst thing}} someone can do while you’re driving?” and I’ll write that down in <b>my</b> <b>car.</b> So the questions happen all the time.|$|R
5000|$|Possessive determiners (adjectives) {{are used}} in {{combination}} with a noun, {{playing the role of}} a determiner or attributive adjective. In English and some other languages, the use of such a word implies the definite article. For example, <b>my</b> <b>car</b> implies the car that belongs to me/is used by me; it is not correct to precede possessives with an article (*the <b>my</b> <b>car)</b> or other definite determiner such as a demonstrative (*this <b>my</b> <b>car),</b> although they can combine with quantifiers in the same ways that the can (all <b>my</b> <b>cars,</b> <b>my</b> three <b>cars,</b> etc.; see English determiners). This is not the case in all languages; for example in Italian the possessive is usually preceded by another determiner such as an article, as in la mia macchina ("my car", literally [...] "the my car") or quel tuo libro ("that book of yours", literally [...] "that your book").|$|R

None of you are to meet these people until we have made at least three episodes.' So I immediately got <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>car</b> and fled up to Yorkshire to meet my man, Donald Sinclair. I was intrigued beyond measure by him. He was a true eccentric and, like all true eccentrics, {{he had no idea}} himself how odd he was! He absolutely hated what I did, because he had no idea he was at all like that, but when we'd really got into it and were producing them at high speed, his friends used to come to me and say, 'You've got him, that's him.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "There {{was a sign}} saying ‘POLICE - INCIDENT’ and {{everyone}} was slowing down {{to see what had}} happened... Afterwards, it struck me that ‘incident’ is a very detached word for something so destructive and traumatic for the people involved. And then I had the sensation that the spirit of someone that had died in the accident entered <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>car</b> and was sitting next to me.The irony of such a cold expression for such seismic events appealed to me, and I began to pick out other ‘incidents’ reported in the media and news, I wrote about the evacuation of teenage girls from a religious cult in Texas, a family terrorizing its neighbours, a body found floating in a river by some people on a fishing trip, and more. Each song is written in the first person and tries to humanize the detached media reportage.” Steven Wilson ...|$|E
5000|$|In an interview, Bazilian said, [...] "I {{wrote of}} Us' one night — the quickest song I ever wrote — to impress a girl. Which worked, because we're {{married and have}} two kids. But {{we were in the}} middle of writing Joan's album, which was a group effort with Rick Chertoff and Joan and Rob and I, and I did a demo of 'One of Us,' this wacky little demo which I ended up putting as a hidden track on the CD of my first solo record, and I played it for them. And it really hadn't even {{occurred}} to me that it was something that Joan might do, but Rick, in his wisdom, asked Joan if she thought she could sing it. And I think it was better that he asked it that way rather than 'Do you want to sing it?' Because the answer to that might not have been yes. But she definitely said she could sing it, and we did a little live demo of a guitar and her singing it. And when I got <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>car</b> and popped the cassette in, I started practicing the Grammy speech that I should've gotten to give." ...|$|E

He also told me a story about being in a car parked on the street, he was into thought experiments, and he said he projected a thought into her mind to get <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>car,</b> and as the woman was walking by the car she stopped, opened the door and sat down and looked at him, and I don't know if she shrieked or what but she was absolutely stunned at what she was doing. He said, I willed her to get into the car, and she did. I think he was as shocked as she was. They were both shocked.He told me when I was in my late teens, and this was before Shirley Maclaine and astral projection, that when he slept, he could float out of his body at night and float on the ceiling and look down and watch himself sleep.

5000|$|Although Rosecrans's {{men were}} {{protected}} by strong defensive positions, the supply lines into Chattanooga were tenuous {{and subject to}} Confederate cavalry raids. Bragg's army occupied the heights surrounding the city and laid siege upon the Union forces. Rosecrans, demoralized by his defeat, proved unable to break the siege without reinforcements. Only hours after the defeat at Chickamauga, Secretary Stanton ordered Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker to travel to Chattanooga with 15,000 men in two corps from the Army of the Potomac in Virginia. Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was ordered to send 20,000 men under his chief subordinate Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, from Vicksburg, Mississippi. On September 29, Stanton ordered Grant to go to Chattanooga himself, as commander of the newly created Military Division of the Mississippi. Grant was given the option of replacing the demoralized Rosecrans with Thomas. Although Grant did not have good personal relations with either general, he selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland. Grant traveled over the treacherous mountain supply line roads and arrived in Chattanooga on October 23.

I was about to drive my car off the bridge. And while I was right there…the enemy was speaking to me, so I had a war going on. I began to drive and accelerate up to 80 miles per hour. God spoke to me just as plain as day and said, ‘Dorinda, are you going to let everything that has been invested in you go down the drain?’ And when I heard God’s voice, I began to take my foot off the accelerator and the car started coasting right to the bridge. And the Lord whispered to me and said, ‘Peace be unto you.’ And that’s when I grabbed the steering wheel and I said, Lord I thank you. I began to weep and cry.
