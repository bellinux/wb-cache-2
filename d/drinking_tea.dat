5|$|Willow bark {{preparations}} {{became a}} standard {{part of the}} materia medica of Western medicine beginning at least with the Greek physician Hippocrates in the fifth century BC; he recommended chewing on willow bark to relieve pain or fever, and <b>drinking</b> <b>tea</b> made from it to relieve pain during childbirth. The Roman encyclopedist Celsus, in his De Medicina of ca. 30 AD, suggested willow leaf extract to treat the four signs of inflammation: redness, heat, swelling and pain. Willow treatments also appeared in Dioscorides's De Materia Medica, and Pliny the Elder's Natural History. By the time of Galen, willow was commonly used throughout the Roman and Arab worlds, as {{a small part of}} a large, growing botanical pharmacopoeia.|$|E
5|$|During {{the earlier}} Northern and Southern dynasties (420–589), {{and perhaps even}} earlier, the {{drinking}} of tea (Camellia sinensis) became popular in southern China. Tea was viewed then as a beverage of tasteful pleasure and with pharmacological purpose as well. During the Tang dynasty, tea became synonymous with everything sophisticated in society. The poet Lu Tong (790–835) devoted most of his poetry to his love of tea. The 8th-century author Lu Yu (known as the Sage of Tea) even wrote a treatise {{on the art of}} <b>drinking</b> <b>tea,</b> called The Classic of Tea. Although wrapping paper had been used in China since the 2nd century BC, during the Tang dynasty the Chinese were using wrapping paper as folded and sewn square bags to hold and preserve the flavor of tea leaves. Indeed, paper found many other uses besides writing and wrapping during the Tang era.|$|E

He ordered Hausser {{to supervise the}} SS troops {{to ensure that the}} surrender was carried out in accordance with his instructions. Kesselring then surrendered to an American major at Saalfelden, near Salzburg, in Austria on 9 May 1945. He was taken to see Major General Maxwell D. Taylor, the commander of the 101st Airborne Division, who treated him courteously, allowing him to keep his weapons and field marshal's baton, and to visit the Eastern Front headquarters of Army Groups Centre and South at Zeltweg and Graz unescorted. Taylor arranged for Kesselring and his staff to move into a hotel at Berchtesgaden. Photographs of Taylor and Kesselring <b>drinking</b> <b>tea</b> together created a stir in the United States. Kesselring met with Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers, commander of the Sixth United States Army Group, and gave interviews to Allied newspaper reporters.|$|E

25|$|Tea {{originated}} in Southwest China, {{where it was}} used as a medicinal drink. It was popularized as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking spread to other East Asian countries.

During the 17th century, <b>drinking</b> <b>tea</b> became fashionable among Britons, who started large-scale production and commercialization of the plant in India to bypass the Chinese monopoly.|$|E

The Zen Buddhist priest Eisai (1141–1215), founder of the Rinzai school of Buddhism, brought tea seeds from China to plant in various places in Japan.

The concentrations of Ca, Mg, K, Al, P, Cu, Zn and Fe in hair and urine were detected using ICP-OES. The RSDs of the method were between 2. 32 % and 8. 03 %, and the analytical results of the hair reference samples were consistent with the certified values. The results showed that the contents of Al, Mg and K in hair, and contents of Al and Ca in urine of herdsmen who were accustomed to <b>drinking</b> brick <b>tea</b> were obviously higher than those in control group (P 0. 05). Chronically <b>drinking</b> brick <b>tea</b> probably brings metabolic disorder of Ca and Al in human body, and the interaction mechanism of life elements in brick-tea fluorosis should be further studied...|$|R

40|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} a common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder in elderly. This study was aimed to systematically evaluate the association between tea intake {{and the risk of}} cognitive disorders by meta-analysis. PubMed, Embase and Wanfang databases were systematically searched and a total of 26 observational studies were included in this study. Odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and pooled by using fixed or random effects models according to the degree of heterogeneity. The overall pooled analysis indicated that tea intake could significantly reduce the risk of cognitive disorders (OR = 0. 65, 95 %CI = 0. 58 - 0. 73). Subgroup analyses were conducted based on study design, population, frequency of <b>tea</b> <b>drinking</b> and type of cognitive disorders. The results showed that <b>tea</b> <b>drinking</b> was significantly associated with the reduced incidence of cognitive disorders in all of subgroups based on study design and frequency of <b>tea</b> <b>drinking.</b> In particular, <b>tea</b> <b>drinking</b> was inversely associated with the risk of cognitive impairment (CoI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), cognitive decline and ungrouped cognitive disorders. Moreover, for population subgroups, the significant association was only found in Chinese people. Our study suggests that daily <b>tea</b> <b>drinking</b> is associated with decreased risk of CoI, MCI and cognitive decline in the elderly. However, the association between tea intake and Alzheimer's disease remains elusive...|$|R
