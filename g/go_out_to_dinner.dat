5|$|While in Washington, Lead Belly {{encountered}} {{several other}} incidents of segregation that {{are believed to}} have contributed to the impetus of the song. For instance, when Lead Belly, Lomax, and their wives wanted to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinner</b> together, they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them. Lead Belly was told that if he returned later without Lomax, he would be served.|$|E

Lee goes to a bar alone, where she meets Ben (Orlando Bloom). When Ben is punched by another man at the bar, she accompanies him to visit Alicia, who is a medical student {{and a friend of}} his, so that Alicia can suture his wound. As Tim and Max smoke marijuana together at the house, Ben cooks dinner for Lee.|$|E

When he is done and the other attendees have left, he sees an unusual butterfly. Upon picking it up, he experiences a cut on his hand and is then attacked by a swarm. Mark jumps out of a window, to his death. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), despite preparing to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinner</b> with her sister, instead agrees to Phillip Broyles' (Lance Reddick) demand that she join the Fringe team's investigation at the scene.

At the scene, Olivia has a brief vision of her deceased lover John Scott (Mark Valley) watching them, which troubles her.|$|E

500|$|Laura {{is taken}} to the hospital, where she later tells John what Heather told her. [...] John is sceptical but pleasantly {{surprised}} by the positive change in Laura's demeanour. Later in the evening after returning from the hospital, John and Laura have passionate sex. Afterwards, they <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinner</b> where they get lost and briefly become separated.

500|$|Peter and Lois {{are leaving}} a doctor's office when actor Ryan Reynolds asks them for directions. He seems very appreciative of Peter. The next morning Peter notices that Ryan has moved in across the street, taking Cleveland Brown's former residence. Ryan says he's filming {{for a movie}} nearby. Peter attends Ryan's housewarming party that night, at which Ryan tickles him and {{requests}} that he return the favor. [...] Later that week, they <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinner,</b> but Peter immediately exits the restaurant when Ryan tries to kiss him. The next day, Peter tells Lois he believes Ryan is gay but Lois rejects the idea. Peter confronts Ryan, who replies that he is only attracted to Peter's spirit {{in the way that}} a man is attracted to a woman. Angered by Peter's accusation, Ryan orders him to leave and that they can never talk again—but hands him a cell phone so they can [...] "always talk".|$|E

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the season, Fazekas recalled the potential story revolving around Carter having a girls night out, saying that they realized that [...] "once Peggy is on the mission, it starts to become difficult for her to have a social life...we kept sort of punting that scene because every time we tried to do it, it was like, 'She's not going to stop to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinner.</b> She has the world to save.'" [...] Also, they felt they were not properly servicing Angie's character, instead [...] "just sticking her in scenes just to be there," [...] resulting in the decision to ultimately not bring Angie back for the season as planned. In her place, the characters of Ana Jarvis and Rose Roberts are featured as confidante's for Carter, [...] "both people who are 100% in on Peggy's secret. Angie sort of figures it {{out at the end of}} the first season but Ana and Rose—there is no need to hide the truth from them. So it makes it a lot easier for her to confide in them." ...|$|E
500|$|Kurt sets up Burt with Finn's widowed mother Carole (Romy Rosemont) in {{the episode}} [...] "Home", hoping {{it will help}} him become closer to Finn, who he has a crush on. The {{relationship}} has become serious before Finn finds out about it, and he is initially hostile to it, but begins to bond with Burt over sports when the two families <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinner.</b> It is implied that Burt's motivation to build a connection with Finn is more out of his knowledge that Finn never had a father to do things with, and not favoritism over his own son. However, Kurt feels left out, and later asks Finn to help him break up their parents. Finn initially agrees, but changes his mind after Burt tells him that he loves Carole and would never hurt her. In [...] "Laryngitis", Kurt feels increasingly jealous of how much time Burt is spending with Finn, so he attempts to emulate Burt's personality to regain Burt's attention. When Burt takes Finn to yet another event without including Kurt, a hurt and angry Kurt drops his emulation {{of his father and}} sings [...] "". Burt overhears his performance, praises Kurt's singing and apologizes for not spending enough time with him. He assures Kurt that he still loves him and always will, no matter what his son chooses to be.|$|E
500|$|Much {{has been}} made of the {{fragmented}} editing of Don't Look Now, and Nicolas Roeg's work in general. Time is presented as 'fluid', where the past, present and future can all exist in the same timeframe. [...] John's premonitions merge with the present, such as {{at the start of the}} film where the mysterious red-coated figure is seemingly depicted in one of his photographic slides, and when he 'sees' Laura on the funeral barge with the sisters and mistakenly believes he is seeing the present, but in fact it is a vision of the future. [...] The most famous use of this fragmented approach to time is during the love scene, in which the scenes of John and Laura having sex are intercut with scenes of them dressing afterwards to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinner.</b> After John is attacked by his assailant in the climactic moments, the preceding events depicted during the course of the film are recalled through flashback, which may be perceived as his life flashing before his eyes. At a narrative level the plot of Don't Look Now can be regarded as a self-fulfilling prophecy: it is John's premonitions of his death that set in motion the events leading up to his death. According to the editor of the film, Graeme Clifford, Nicolas Roeg regarded the film as his [...] "exercise in film grammar".|$|E

5000|$|Every day, Phillips {{reads the}} letters sent to her Dear Abby column and pens her {{column in the}} afternoon.

500|$|Christie {{commented that}} [...] "people didn't do scenes {{like that in}} those days", and that she found the scenes {{difficult}} to film: [...] "There were no available examples, no role models ... I just went blank and Nic [...] shouted instructions." [...] The scene caused problems with censors {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. [...] The American censor advised Nicolas Roeg explicitly, saying, [...] "We cannot see humping. We cannot see the rise and fall between thighs." [...] The scene's much celebrated fragmented style, in which scenes of the couple having sexual intercourse are intercut with scenes of the couple post-coitally getting dressed to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinner,</b> partly came about through Roeg's attempt to accommodate the concerns of the censors: [...] "They scrutinised it and found absolutely nothing they could object to. If someone goes up, you cut and the next time you see them they're in a different position, you obviously fill in the gaps for yourself. But, technically speaking, there was no 'humping' in that scene." [...] In the end, Roeg only cut nine frames from the sequence, and the film was awarded an R rating in the United States. In Britain, the British Board of Film Classification judged the uncut version to be [...] "tasteful and integral to the plot", and a scene in which Donald Sutherland's character can be clearly seen performing oral sex on Christie's character was permitted, but it was still given an X rating—an adults only certificate.|$|E
6000|$|He thought Mrs. Darling was not {{sufficiently}} impressed, {{and he went}} on sternly, [...] "I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my neck we don't <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinner</b> to-night, and if I don't <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinner</b> to-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don't go to the office again, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into the streets." ...|$|E

60|$|A wave of {{grateful}} emotion {{rushed over}} the boy, blinding {{his eyes with}} tears, and before he could speak to thank his benefactor, dinner was called.
