In this work, the extraction, isolation, characterisation, modification and enzymatic hydrolysis of <b>hemicelluloses</b> from agricultural and forestry crops have been investigated. Extraction of the <b>hemicelluloses</b> arabinoxylan from barley husks, and corn fibres and acetylated galactoglucomannan (AcGGM) from spruce chips, was performed with heat treatment at neutral conditions, using microwave irradiation or steam pretreatment. Extraction of polymeric <b>hemicelluloses</b> was possible and the <b>hemicelluloses</b> extracted from all species investigated were acetylated. Isolation and concentration of the soluble <b>hemicelluloses</b> were performed with membrane filtration and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), respectively.

B-mannanase catalysed hydrolysis of AcGGM with various degrees of natural and chemical substituents revealed steric hindrance and decreased hydrolysis rate with increased substitution. Hydrogels were made from chemically modified AcGGM. BSA was incorporated as a model drug. The release of BSA from AcGGM hydrolgels was increased by the addition of b-mannanase.

To increase their utilization, the isolation of <b>hemicelluloses</b> from industrial biomass side-streams would be beneficial. A method was investigated to isolate <b>hemicelluloses</b> from process water from a thermomechanical pulp mill. The method consists of three steps: removal of solids by microfiltration, preconcentration of the <b>hemicelluloses</b> by ultrafiltration, and purification by either size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) or diafiltration. The purpose of the final purification step is to separate <b>hemicelluloses</b> from small oligosaccharides, monosaccharides, and salts. The ratio between galactose, glucose, and mannose in oligo- and polysaccharides after preconcentration was 0. 8 : 1 : 2. 8, which is similar to that found in galactoglucomannan. Continuous diafiltration was performed using a composite fluoro polymer membrane with cutoff of 1000 Da. After diafiltration with four diavolumes the purity of the <b>hemicelluloses</b> was 77 % (gram oligo- and polysaccharides/gram total dissolved solids) and the recovery was 87 %.

25|$|Nixtamalized maize {{has several}} {{benefits}} over unprocessed grain: {{it is more}} easily ground; its nutritional value is increased; flavor and aroma are improved; and mycotoxins are reduced. Lime and ash are highly alkaline: the alkalinity helps the dissolution of <b>hemicellulose,</b> the major glue-like component of the maize cell walls, and loosens the hulls from the kernels and softens the maize. Some of the corn oil is broken down into emulsifying agents (monoglycerides and diglycerides), while bonding of the maize proteins to each other is also facilitated. The divalent calcium in lime acts as a cross-linking agent for protein and polysaccharide acidic side chains. As a result, while cornmeal made from untreated ground maize is unable by itself to form a dough on addition of water, the chemical changes in masa allow dough formation. These benefits make nixtamalization a crucial preliminary step for further processing of maize into food products, and the process is employed using both traditional and industrial methods, {{in the production of}} tortillas and tortilla chips (but not corn chips), tamales, hominy, and many other items.|$|E
