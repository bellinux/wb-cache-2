25|$|The {{motives of}} the murder were not made clear during the trial. Was it a satanic crime, one of the human sacrifices that the MLO members had talked about? Or was it rather a hate crime, {{motivated}} by the anger Nödtveidt and Vlad had felt when confronted with Meddour's personality? According to criminal inspector Lars Ohlin, who led the police investigation, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> that Nödtveidt and Vlad's acts were made on a background of Satanism, but homophobia was also a clear factor, and the Keillers Park murder was registered as a hate crime by the Swedish police.|$|E
25|$|Systems that don't have {{a trusted}} {{computing}} base {{as part of their}} design do not provide security of their own: they are only secure insofar as security is provided to them by external means (e.g. a computer sitting in a locked room without a network connection may be considered secure depending on the policy, regardless of the software it runs). This is because, as David J. Farber et al. put it, n a computer system, the integrity of lower layers is typically treated as axiomatic by higher layers. As far as computer security is concerned, reasoning about the security properties of a computer system requires being able to make sound assumptions about what it can, and more importantly, cannot do; however, barring any reason to believe otherwise, a computer is able to do everything that a general Von Neumann machine can. This obviously includes operations that would be deemed contrary to all but the simplest security policies, such as divulging an email or password that should be kept secret; however, barring special provisions in the architecture of the system, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> that the computer could be programmed to perform these undesirable tasks.|$|E

500|$|The scenes showing Madonna walking {{alone on}} the beach was an homage to actress Joan Crawford in the 1946 film, Humoresque. Christopher Rosa from VH1 listed {{it as one of}} Madonna's 10 Most Underrated Videos. He {{compared}} the blue-tinged visuals to the video for [...] "Frozen", but found the plot to be more complex. Rosa also noted that the ending showing Madonna walking towards the sea was purposefully ambiguous. [...] "Does Madonna drown herself in the ocean? Does she move on from her lover? Whatever the case, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> this moody video is one of Madge's most effective ever," [...] he concluded.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Variety, on {{the other}} hand, called the show [...] "loony" [...] and [...] "without a story, form, music, dancing, beauty or artistry.... It's impossible to tell whether [...] talent. [...] Maybe talent is irrelevant in this new kind of show business." [...] Reviews in the news weeklies were mixed; Jack Kroll in Newsweek wrote, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> the sheer kinetic drive of this new Hair... there is something hard, grabby, slightly corrupt about O'Horgan's virtuosity, like Busby Berkeley gone bitchy." [...] But a reviewer from Time wrote that although the show [...] "thrums with vitality [...] crippled by being a bookless musical and, like a boneless fish, it drifts when it should swim." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Salmaan {{signed on}} for debutante Srinath Rajendran's Second Show (2012) {{in which he}} {{played the role of}} Harilal, a gangster. When asked in an {{interview}} about his [...] "unconventional entry with a bunch of newcomers", Salmaan stated that it was his conscious decision as he felt that [...] " ... when an actor debuts, he has to earn the right to be a hero and not get it through a shortcut route." [...] The film received mixed reviews. A critic for Sify stated, [...] " ... it is Salmaan's amazing screen presence and a matured acting style that makes the movie an engaging watch", while Paresh C Palicha of Rediff criticized his performance. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> that he looks dapper and has an attractive baritone (a gift of his gene pool). But that does not translate into good performance or acting." [...] The film was commercially successful and won him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut.|$|E

500|$|Press in Europe {{ranged from}} mixed to negative. The press in Germany {{did not like}} the film. At the Berlin premiere, a writer for The New York Times wrote [...] "Whatever you think of the {{director}} Charles [...] Theodor Dreyer, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> that he is 'different.' He does things that make people talk about him. You may find his films ridiculous—but you won't forget them...Although in many ways [...] {{was one of the worst}} films I have ever attended, there were some scenes in it that gripped with brutal directness". Press reaction to the film in Paris was mixed. Reporter Herbert Matthews of The New York Times wrote that Vampyr was [...] "a hallucinating film", that [...] "either held the spectators spellbound as in a long nightmare or else moved them to hysterical laughter". For many years after Vampyrs initial release, the film was viewed by critics as one of Dreyer's weaker works.|$|E
500|$|Mike Clark of USA Today {{commented that}} he was most fascinated by the casting choices. [...] "Equally {{delightful}} is the Alison Lohman character's evolution into an older woman (Jessica Lange). It's a metamorphosis to equal any in screen history." [...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli found the fairy tale approach reminiscent of The Princess Bride (1987) and the films of Terry Gilliam. [...] "Big Fish is a clever, smart fantasy that targets the child inside every adult," [...] Berardinelli said, [...] "without insulting the intelligence of either." [...] Roger Ebert, in a mixed review, wrote [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> that Will has a point: The old man is a blowhard. There is {{a point at which}} his stories stop working as entertainment and segue into sadism." [...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine was disappointed, finding the father-son reconciliation storyline to be over-dramatically cliché. [...] "You recall The Boy Who Cried Wolf? Edward Bloom is the man who cried fish." [...] Big Fish was #85 on Slant Magazine's best films of the 2000s.|$|E
500|$|The storyline was criticised by {{some former}} Coronation Street cast members, who {{believed}} the producers {{were using the}} subject of rape to gain higher ratings than rival soap opera EastEnders. Taylor defended the storyline and hoped that it would help other {{women who had been}} attacked to seek help. She stated [...] "The main focus of the storyline is the psychological effect that the attack has on Toyah. There are many women out there who have been raped or sexually assaulted and we owe it to them {{to make sure that the}} story-line is handled sensitively and accurately. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> that rape is a sensitive and controversial storyline. But I have put my heart and soul into it trying to portray it accurately and I only hope that women who have experienced it will think I have given it justice." [...] A show spokesperson commented that the storyline would be [...] "handled sensitively" [...] and that it would not become [...] "a whodunnit". Some of the male residents came under suspicion and were forced to give DNA samples. Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) briefly became the prime suspect, but DNA soon eliminated him from enquires.|$|E

500|$|... "Radio" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} contemporary critics, who praised Knowles's brief departure from usual R style {{as well as}} the believability and originality of the song. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted that though the 1980s synthpop mode of [...] "Radio" [...] may not be as well suited to Beyoncé's voice as the old soul samples contained in [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] (2003) and [...] "Suga Mama" [...] (2007)", there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> that [...] "Radio" [...] is an [...] "irresistible pop song". Colin McGuire of PopMatters highlighted Knowles's diversion from her usual R style, writing that [...] "Radio" [...] is [...] "a bit of a novelty act [...] " [...] which takes Beyoncé in a new direction. He further wrote that the different elements of dance music present in the song makes it feel refreshing, before adding that [...] "it might even suggest a more expansive, experimental side of the songstress on her follow-up". Talia Kraines of BBC Music wrote that [...] "wild" [...] "Radio" [...] makes it the standout track on I Am... Sasha Fierce. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine chose [...] "Radio" [...] as the highlight of both the standard and deluxe editions of I Am... Sasha Fierce, writing that it is the most convincing love song on the album.|$|E

And if taken outside the animal movement, that they are a well-known 'brand' in general. That is an amazing impact for a so-called 'fringe' issue." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1935, the American {{composer}} Marc Blitzstein compared Stravinsky to Jacopo Peri and C.P.E. Bach, conceding that, [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> {{the greatness}} of Stravinsky. It is just {{that he is not}} great enough". Blitzstein's Marxist position was that Stravinsky's wish to [...] "divorce music from other streams of life", which is [...] "symptomatic of an escape from reality", resulted in a [...] "loss of stamina", naming specifically Apollo, the Capriccio, and Le Baiser de la fée.|$|E

2500|$|Delaware deputy {{attorneys}} Steven P. Wood and Peggy J. Hageman, who prosecuted Red Dog, {{tried and}} failed to find a motive. [...] According to Wood, attributing Red Dog's behavior to his upbringing is too easy: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> the privation Native Americans are subjected to on reservations, but the simple fact is there are hundreds of thousands of Native Americans raised in those conditions, and precious few become multiple murders", he said, as well as that his killings were [...] "essentially motiveless".|$|E
2500|$|The {{ampersand}} that commonly links Lewis to Clark {{has become}} the iconic shorthand logo, with an epsilon version prominently displayed {{on the front of}} every team's hat. The league chose to showcase one unifying logo [...] in this case, a punctuation mark [...] instead of unique, team-specific fonts or graphics. The colors differentiate one team from all others. It can be an ambiguous conversation starter, but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> that each team's New Era caps are clearly part of the same league. For this reason, the [...] "Amp League" [...] is another colloquial nickname for the LCBL.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} of who Soulouque really was is heavily disputed. Virtually no official government records of cabinet meetings exists. According to Latin American scholar Murdo J. MacLeod ("The Soulouque Regime In Haiti -- 1847 - 1859: A Reevaluation.", Caribbean Studies/Vol. 10. No. 3): [...] "We are left with his policies as they are discernible, with {{an assessment of the}} men whom he used to govern, and with our evaluation of how correct his appreciation of the situation really was. In every case we must conclude that Faustin Soulouque was a man of high intelligence, a realist, a pragmatist, and a superb, if ruthless politician and diplomat.

2500|$|It {{is worth}} noting that Lawrence was very {{interested}} in the sense of touch and that his focus on physical intimacy has its roots in a desire to restore an emphasis on the body, and re-balance it with what he perceived to be Western civilisation's over-emphasis on the mind; writing in a 1929 essay [...] "Men Must Work and Women As Well", he stated,"Now we see the trend of our civilization, in terms of human feeling and human relation. It is, and there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>denying</b> it, towards a greater and greater abstraction from the physical, towards a further and further physical separateness between men and women, and between individual and individual… It only remains for some men and women, individuals, to try to get back their bodies and preserve the flow of warmth, affection and physical unison."
