2500|$|Hydrogen {{has been}} {{called one of the}} least {{efficient}} and most expensive possible replacements for gasoline (petrol) in terms of reducing greenhouse gases; other technologies may be less expensive and more quickly implemented. [...] A comprehensive study of hydrogen in transportation applications has found that [...] "there are major hurdles on the path to achieving the vision of the hydrogen economy; the path will not be simple or straightforward". Although Ford Motor Company and French Renault-Nissan cancelled their <b>hydrogen</b> <b>car</b> R efforts in 2008 and 2009, respectively, they signed a 2009 letter of intent with the other manufacturers and Now GMBH in September 2009 supporting the commercial introduction of FCVs by 2015. [...] A study by The Carbon Trust for the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change suggests that hydrogen technologies have the potential to deliver UK transport with near-zero emissions whilst reducing dependence on imported oil and curtailment of renewable generation. However, the technologies face very difficult challenges, in terms of cost, performance and policy.|$|E

2500|$|... {{there are}} 3 <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cars</b> {{publicly}} available in select markets: the Toyota Mirai, the Hyundai ix35 FCEV, and the Honda Clarity. Several {{other companies are}} working to develop <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cars.</b> As of 2014, 95% of hydrogen is made from natural gas. It can be produced using renewable sources, but that is an expensive process. Integrated wind-to-hydrogen (power-to-gas) plants, using electrolysis of water, are exploring technologies to deliver costs low enough, and quantities great enough, to compete with hydrogen production using natural gas. The drawbacks of hydrogen use are high carbon emissions intensity when produced from natural gas, capital cost burden, low energy content per unit volume, production and compression of hydrogen, and the large investment in infrastructure {{that would be required}} to fuel vehicles.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>hydrogen</b> <b>car</b> is an {{automobile}} which uses hydrogen as its {{primary source of}} power for locomotion. These cars generally use the hydrogen {{in one of two}} methods: combustion or fuel-cell conversion. In combustion, the hydrogen is [...] "burned" [...] in engines in fundamentally the same method as traditional gasoline cars. In fuel-cell conversion, the hydrogen is turned into electricity through fuel cells which then powers electric motors. With either method, the only byproduct from the spent hydrogen is water, however during combustion with air NOx can be produced.|$|E
5000|$|Critiques of {{hydrogen}} vehicles {{are presented in}} the 2006 documentary, Who Killed the Electric Car?. According to former U.S. Department of Energy official Joseph Romm, [...] "A <b>hydrogen</b> <b>car</b> {{is one of the}} least efficient, most expensive ways to reduce greenhouse gases." [...] Asked when hydrogen cars will be broadly available, Romm replied: [...] "Not in our lifetime, and very possibly never." [...] The Los Angeles Times wrote, in 2009, [...] "Hydrogen fuel-cell technology won't work in cars. ... Any way you look at it, hydrogen is a lousy way to move cars." ...|$|E

A BMW hydrogen prototype (H2R) using the driveline of this model broke the speed record for hydrogen cars at 300 km/h (186 mi/h), making automotive history. Mazda has developed Wankel engines to burn hydrogen. The Wankel uses a rotary principle of operation, so the hydrogen burns in {{a different part of the}} engine from the intake. This reduces pre-detonation, a problem with hydrogen fueled piston engines.|$|E
