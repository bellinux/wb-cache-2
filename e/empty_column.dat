According to the 12th-century historian William of Malmesbury, Gerbert got {{the idea of the}} computing device of the abacus from a Spanish Arab. The abacus that Gerbert reintroduced into Europe had its length divided into 27 parts with 9 number symbols (this would exclude zero, which was represented by an <b>empty</b> <b>column)</b> and 1,000 characters in all, crafted out of animal horn by a shieldmaker of Rheims. According to his pupil Richer, Gerbert could perform speedy calculations with his abacus that were extremely difficult for people in his day to think through in using only Roman numerals. Due to Gerbert's reintroduction, the abacus became widely used in Europe once again during the 11th century.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Data {{gathering}} in sensor networks {{is required to}} be efficient, adaptable and robust. Recently, compressive sensing (CS) based data gathering shows promise in meeting these requirements. Existing CS-based data gathering solutions require that a transform that best sparsifies the sensor readings {{should be used in}} order to reduce the amount of data traffic in the network as much as possible. As a result, it is very likely that different transforms have to be determined for varied sensor networks, which seriously affects the adaptability of CS-based schemes. In addition, the existing schemes result in significant errors when the sampling rate of sensor data is low (equivalent to the case of high packet loss rate) because CS inherently requires that the number of measurements should exceed a certain threshold. This paper presents STCDG, an efficient data gathering scheme based on matrix completion. STCDG takes advantage of the lowrank feature instead of sparsity, thereby avoiding the problem of having to be customized for specific sensor networks. Besides, we exploit the presence of the short-term stability feature in sensor data, which further narrows down the set of feasible readings and reduces the recovery errors significantly. Furthermore, STCDG avoids the optimization problem involving <b>empty</b> <b>columns</b> by first removing the <b>empty</b> <b>columns</b> and only recovering the non-empty columns, then filling the <b>empty</b> <b>columns</b> using an optimization technique based on temporal stability.

50|$|In the {{horizontal}} columns a card may {{be moved to}} any other card in the column {{as long as it}} is in descending numerical sequence. For example, a six of hearts may be moved to a seven of any suit. However, a sequence of cards can only be moved if they are all of the same suit in numerical descending order. For example, a six and seven of hearts may be moved to an eight of any suit, but a six of hearts and seven of clubs cannot be moved together. Moving the top card in a column allows the topmost hidden card to be turned over. This card then enters into the play. Other cards can be placed on it, and it can be moved to other cards in a sequence or to an <b>empty</b> <b>column.</b>|$|E

The meter's fill level {{may or may not}} rise depending on the difficulty. If it does rise, it moves up two lines which makes it harder to fill and less effective. The meter can be reduced by two lines (to a minimum of two) by scoring an [...] "All Clear" [...] of completely clearing the board of pieces.

5000|$|The game {{is divided}} into three phases each with its own rules of capture. [...] All three {{capturing}} methods are perhaps unique to Pasang. In the first phase, each player must choose a column of tokens to capture on their side of the board. The <b>empty</b> <b>column</b> left on the board is called a [...] "passage". For the second phase, each player chooses a [...] "ka" [...] from among the tokens next to the passage, or tokens one column away from the passage whichever method both players agree upon. The [...] "ka" [...] then enters the passage and captures any odd number of tokens of the same color that it forms a line with from any orthogonal direction. From there on (third phase), each player's [...] "ka" [...] moves any number of vacant spaces in an orthogonal direction provided it can capture an odd number of tokens of the same color. However, the [...] "ka" [...] at this phase of the game captures tokens differently. If the [...] "ka" [...] is moving vertically (up and down), it can only capture tokens in a horizontal direction that it forms a line with.
