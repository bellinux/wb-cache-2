5|$|In {{his initial}} {{negotiations}} with Willamette Week, Goldschmidt agreed to resign his positions with the Texas Pacific Group and the Board of Higher Education, which <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> <b>His</b> decision in 1990 {{not to run}} {{for a second term}} as governor, long the subject of speculation, was finally explained. Further developments revealed that Goldschmidt was assisted by businessman Robert K. Burtchaell in keeping his molestation of the girl a secret. In return, Goldschmidt gave his support to Burtchaell's (unsuccessful) bid to extend a lease for a houseboat moorage on the Willamette River.|$|E
5|$|All {{the while}} Hancock was posted in New York, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> {{best to keep}} his {{political}} ambitions alive. He received some votes at the Democrats' 1876 convention, but was never a serious contender as New York governor Samuel J. Tilden swept the field on the second ballot. The Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, won the election, and Hancock refocused his ambition on 1880. The electoral crisis of 1876 and the subsequent end to Reconstruction in 1877 convinced many observers that the election of 1880 would give the Democrats their best chance at victory in a generation.|$|E

5|$|Creative {{differences}} {{arising from}} his work with Douglas and the film studios, a dislike of Hollywood, and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick {{to move to the}} United Kingdom in 1961, where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career. His home at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire, which he shared with his wife Christiane, became his workplace, where <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> writing, research, editing, and management of production details. This allowed him to have almost complete artistic control over his films, but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios. His first British productions were two films with Peter Sellers, Lolita (1962) and Dr. Strangelove (1964).|$|E
5|$|He {{spent most}} of his early life in Richmond and at Kew Palace, where he was educated by private tutors. At the age of thirteen, he joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman, and was present at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1780. His {{experiences}} in the navy seem to have been little different from those of other midshipmen, though in contrast to other sailors he was accompanied on board ships by a tutor. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> share of the cooking and got arrested with his shipmates after a drunken brawl in Gibraltar; he was hastily released from custody after his identity became known.|$|E
5|$|In September 1989, Peterson outbid two challengers {{to acquire}} Stereo Super Stores, whose parent company had filed for {{bankruptcy}} the month before, paying $940,000 plus another $1,000,000 for inventory. The acquisition included a car stereo specialty shop at Mall 205, Car Stereo East. Peterson continued to operate the franchise's locations at Jantzen Beach and Washington Square Too without a branding change until March 1991, when he renamed them Tom Peterson Super Stores, as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> original home electronics store at 82nd and Foster. Peterson explained that the original stores were performing better than the newly acquired outlets, {{so he decided to}} combine them. His other two stores and car specialty store were unaffected.|$|E

5|$|Mary Boleyn, Anne Boleyn's older sister, {{had earlier}} been {{recalled}} from France in late 1519, ostensibly for her affairs with the French {{king and his}} courtiers. She married William Carey, a minor noble, in February 1520, at Greenwich, with Henry VIII in attendance; soon after, Mary Boleyn became the English King's mistress. Historians dispute King Henry VIII's paternity of {{one or both of}} Mary Boleyn's children born during this marriage. Henry VIII: The King and His Court, by Alison Weir, questions the paternity of Henry Carey; Dr. G.W. Bernard (The King's Reformation) and Joanna Denny (Anne Boleyn: A New Life of England's Tragic Queen) argue that Henry VIII was their father. Henry did not acknowledge either child, as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> son Henry Fitzroy, his illegitimate son by Elizabeth Blount, Lady Talboys.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Ohio, the degree from a prestigious Eastern school made Garfield a man of distinction. He {{returned}} to Hiram to teach at the Institute, and in 1857 was made its president. He did not see education as a field that would realize his full potential. At Williams, he had become more politically aware in the intensely anti-slavery atmosphere of the Massachusetts school, and began to consider politics as a career. In 1858, he married Lucretia; they would have seven children, five of whom survived infancy. Soon after the wedding, he formally entered his name to read law at a Cleveland firm, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> studying in Hiram. He {{was admitted to the}} bar in 1861.|$|E
