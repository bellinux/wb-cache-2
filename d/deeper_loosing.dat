50|$|The shoots {{are served}} like asparagus: steamed, {{with either a}} béchamel sauce or melted butter, salt and pepper. It is apt to get bruised or damaged in {{transport}} and should be eaten very soon after cutting, this may explain its subsequent decline in popularity. However, given a rich, deep and sandy soil, {{it is easy to}} propagate and grow on from root cuttings available from specialist nurseries. Blanching may be achieved by covering it with opaque material or using a <b>deep,</b> <b>loose</b> and dry mulch.|$|R
40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{bearing capacity}} of shallow foundations under axial vertical loads on dense sand overlying <b>deep</b> <b>loose</b> deposit has been investigated. In the literature, several theories can be found using simplified failure mechanisms {{in conjunction with the}} punching shear failure. Accordingly, assumptions were used to simplify the evaluation of the level of mobilization of the shear strength on the punching column. This is mainly due to the complexity of modeling the earth pressure distribution on the punching column. In this study a numerical model was developed to investigate the case of continuous footing on dense sand overlying loose sand. The model utilizes the powerful software "PLAXIS" version 8. 6, which is capable to model such complex interaction in two-dimensional stress analysis. The model was validated with the prototype test results of Meyerhof and Hanna (1978) and Hanna (1981 - a). The results of this investigation showed that the shear strength mobilized on the punching column depends on the relative strength of the two layers, the width of the footing and the thickness and angle of shearing resistance of the upper layer. Design procedure and design charts have been presented to assist foundation engineers to predict the bearing capacity of footing on dense sand overlying <b>deep</b> <b>loose</b> deposit...|$|R

40|$|Ilmenite-rich {{pyroclastic}} deposits {{may prove}} to be excellent sites {{for the establishment of a}} permanent lunar base for mining purposes. A wide variety of potentially useful by-products could be produced (e. g., Fe, Ti, H, N, C, S, Cu, Zn, Cd, Bi, and Pb). A number of ilmenite-rich pyroclastic deposits of regional extent has been studied. The physical properties of the regional pyroclastic units have important implications for lunar construction. These extensive, deep deposits of ilmenite-rich pyroclastic material are block-free and uncontaminated; they could be easily excavated and would be ideal for lunar mining operations.

50|$|The {{indigenous}} people of North America developed {{the most advanced}} and diverse snowshoes prior to the 20th century. Nearly every North American aboriginal culture developed its own particular shape of shoe, the simplest and most primitive being those of the far north. The Inuit have two styles, one being triangular in shape and about 18 in in length, and the other almost circular, both reflecting the need for high flotation in <b>deep,</b> <b>loose</b> and powdery snow. However, contrary to popular perception, the Inuit did not use their snowshoes much since they did most of their foot travel in winter over sea ice or on the tundra, where snow does not pile up deeply.|$|R

The place is situated in the large bay between the islands of Limbe and Banca, and consists of steep beach {{more than a mile}} in length, of <b>deep</b> <b>loose</b> and coarse black volcanic sand (or rather gravel), very fatiguing to walk over. It is bounded at each extremity by a small river with hilly ground beyond, while the forest behind the beach itself is tolerably level and its growth stunted. We probably have here an ancient lava stream from the Klabat volcano, which has flowed down a valley into the sea, and the decomposition of which has formed the loose black sand. In confirmation of this view, it may be mentioned that the beaches beyond the small rivers in both directions are of white sand.|$|R
50|$|The {{reproductive}} {{season for}} this species varies geographically and {{from year to}} year depending on local conditions. Mating probably occurs in the spring soon after emergence. Males turn orange on the underside when they are breeding. Females lay 2-6 eggs during June and July. Western skink females construct nest chambers that are several centimeters <b>deep</b> in <b>loose</b> moist soil. Typically these chambers are located under surface objects, especially flat stones, logs, and sometimes in or near rock outcrops.|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} reveal the impacts of tillage systems on the {{fractions}} (active, slow, and passive carbon) and chemical compositions of soil organic carbon (SOC). A long-term (26 years) tillage experiment in northeast China examined no-tillage (NT), plowing tillage (PT) and <b>deep</b> <b>loosing</b> (DL). The soil samples (from a depth of 0 - 20 cm) were wet-sieved into five aggregate classes (1000 - 2000 mu m, 500 - 1000 mu m, 250 - 500 mu m, 50 - 250 mu m, and 250 mu m) were assessed by CPMAS C- 13 NMR. Macro-aggregates contained more SOC concentration than micro-aggregates. However, PT resulted in a greater SOC concentration in 50 - 500 mu m aggregates. NT and DL increased the active C and decreased the slow C in 500 - 1000 mu m aggregates, whereas PT showed the inverse. The C- 13 NMR spectrum demonstrated that NT increased alkyl-C content, PT obtained a higher carbonyl-C concentration, and DL gained a greater O-alkyl-C concentration. Moreover, evaluating the impacts of tillage systems on the complexity revealed that the most complicated structure was presented in NT, the least in PT, whereas DL had an intermediate effect. Active C contains C 2 -C 6 carbohydrate and anomeric C (Cl) polysaccharides, slow c consists of aldehyde-C, ketonic-C and quinone-C, and the passive C is enriched in aromatic-C. In conclusion, long-term tillage systems significantly affected the fractions and compositions of SOC. with NT stabilizing the SOC. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The Nebraska Sandhills is {{the largest}} area of sand dunes in the Western Hemisphere, occupying over 5 million ha in northcentral Nebraska. The rolling to steep dunes range in height from a few meters to over 60 m. Soils are poorly {{developed}} in wind deposited sand. The continental climate is characterized by 425 to 625 mm of annual precipitation, an average annual temperature of 10 C, and a frost-free period of 130 - 155 days. Upland vegetation is primarily tall grasses and midgrasses such as sand bluestem [Andropogon gerardii var. paucipilus (Nash) Fern. ], prairie sandreed [CaLamovilfa Longifolia (Hook.) Scribn. ], little bluestem [Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash], and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.). Forbs are common. Wind erosion occurs when the protective cover of vegetation is destroyed. Blowouts are active sites of erosion. Blowouts are irregular or conical craters formed when the <b>deep,</b> <b>loose</b> sands are removed by swirling action of the prevailing northwesterly winds. Blowout penstemon (Penstemon haydenii S. Wats.) is only found on these sites of active wind erosion and is an early successional species. Important associated species in blowouts include blowout grass [Redfieldia flexuosa (Thurb.) Vasey] and lemon scurfpea (Psoralea Lanceolata Pursh). The number of blowouts has decreased with the control of fire and improved range management techniques. Loss of suitable habitat {{is one of the}} reasons for the decline of blowout penstemon.

50|$|Burrows {{are usually}} located on slopes {{at the base}} of {{sagebrush}} plants, and face north to east. Tunnels widen below the surface, forming chambers, and extend to a maximum depth of about 1 m. Burrows typically have 4 or 5 entrances but may have as few as 2 or as many as 10. In Oregon, pygmy rabbits inhabited areas where soils were significantly <b>deeper</b> and <b>looser</b> than soils at adjacent sites. Site selection was probably related to ease of excavation of burrows. In areas where soil is shallow pygmy rabbits live in holes among volcanic rocks, in stone walls, around abandoned buildings, and in burrows made by badgers (Taxidea taxus) and marmots (Marmota flaviventris).|$|R

The eggs hatch after about 13 to 16 days. Young chicks are often fed with pieces of small birds captured by the parents. A second brood may be raised in the same nest. They are sometimes parasitized by cuckoos such as the common cuckoo (Dehra Dun), common hawk-cuckoo, Jacobin cuckoo and the Asian koel in Bangladesh.|$|R
