The unit moves on <b>inner</b> <b>rails</b> of the support structures of the low field shaping coils which are arranged along the the main spectrometer. The unit propagates on a caterpillar drive and contains an electro motor, battery pack, board electronics, 2 triaxial flux gate sensors and 2 inclination senors. During operation all relevant data are stored on board and transmitted to the master station after the docking station is reached...|$|R

50|$|The {{point where}} two {{straight}} but intersecting railroads cross {{is called a}} frog. A groove through each rail allows the wheel flanges {{to pass through the}} intersecting rails. Without countermeasures each wheel would dip into the groove and strike the frog point gap causing unacceptable wear. The point where two tracks join and the vehicle can take one of two directions is called a railway switch. This works on the same principle, except that the <b>inner</b> <b>rail</b> is almost continuous and the outer rail has a gap for the flange to pass through.|$|E
50|$|Generally {{the aim is}} for {{trains to}} run without flange contact, which also depends on the tyre profile of the wheels. Allowance {{has to be made}} for the {{different}} speeds of trains. Slower trains will tend to make flange contact with the <b>inner</b> <b>rail</b> on curves, while faster trains will tend to ride outwards and make contact with the outer rail. Either contact causes wear and tear and may lead to derailment. Many high-speed lines do not permit slower freight trains, particularly with heavier axle loads. In some cases, the impact is reduced by the use of flange lubrication.|$|E
50|$|Normally, {{passenger}} trains run above the balancing speed, {{and the difference}} between the balancing superelevation for the speed and curvature and the actual superelevation on the curve is known as unbalanced superelevation. Track superelevation is usually limited to 6 in, and is often lower on routes with slow heavy freight trains in order to reduce wear on the <b>inner</b> <b>rail.</b> Track unbalanced superelevation in the U.S. is restricted to 3 in, though 6 in is permissible by waiver. There is no hard maximum set for European railways, some of which have curves with over 11 in of unbalanced superelevation to permit high-speed transportation.|$|E

40|$|Curving of rail {{vehicles}} {{is often}} connected with vibrations, {{which can be}} caused by rail corrugation or friction induced oscillation in the wheel/rail-contact. This paper deals with heavy vibrations at the running gear of a metro vehicle with a typical frequency of 80 Hz on curves with a radius between 50 and 200 m. Specific characteristics of the vibrations are the occurrence by passing over rails without an initial corrugation and the disappearance if the rails are wet. In the curves of the concerned network, corrugation can also be found with a corresponding wavelength on the outer <b>rails,</b> but the <b>inner</b> <b>rails</b> show shorter wavelengths. For {{a better understanding of the}} originating process a simulation model is set up using the commercial Multi-Body-Simulation-Software SIMPACK. The model includes the vehicle and the track. After an identification of the undetermined parameters the model shows the same behaviour as the real system. The vibration is characterized by large amplitudes of the normal force in the wheel/rail-contact. The originating mechanism and the determining parameters of the oscillation are identified. Using a simple wear law the possibility of rail corrugation originated by these vibrations can be shown with different wavelengths on the <b>inner</b> and outer <b>rail</b> as observed in the measurements...|$|R

50|$|In curved track, it {{is usually}} {{designed}} to raise the outer rail, providing a banked turn, thus allowing trains to maneuver through the curve at higher speeds than would otherwise be possible if the surface was flat or level. It also helps a train steer around a curve, keeping the wheel flanges from pressing the rails, minimizing friction and wear. The measurement {{of the difference in}} elevation between the outer rail and the <b>inner</b> <b>rail</b> is called cant in most countries. Sometime the cant is measured in term of angle instead of height difference. In the United States, it is measured in height difference and called crosslevel, even for the curved track.|$|E
50|$|The {{upper part}} of each incline had {{essentially}} two sets of railway tracks side by side (three rails, with the <b>inner</b> <b>rail</b> shared by both tracks), while below the midsection of each incline (where wagons passed each other) {{the two sets of}} track were 'interwoven'. Each side of the inclines alternately had wagons ascending and descending — otherwise the ropes would get crossed over. (An image of a full wagon descending the {{upper part of}} one incline can be seen below in External links.) The southern side of the inclines was called the 'Company Side', as that was the side the company offices were located on; the northern side of the inclines was called the 'Donkey Side'.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of sold-separate clamp has a single {{horizontal}} bolt-with-nut which goes behind the top of the seat post. Tightening this bolt brings together four pieces of metal (two on each side) which have round slots to grab and hold standard-size rails. The <b>inner</b> <b>rail</b> grabbing pieces have interlocking grooves on the other side that interface into disc shapes on the outer sides of the central post-grabbing piece. Continued tightening of the bolt causes the central piece to close very slightly around the top of the post. To adjust the saddle's position for comfort, loosening the bolt allows the rails to slide forward and backward and to tilt up and down around the axis of the bolt.|$|E
