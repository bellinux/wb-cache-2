50|$|During {{the early}} 70’s simple system for {{hot melt glue}} binding within the office market started to appear but the market was fragmented, some {{companies}} produced the machines and others produced the supplies. Bindomatic was founded in 1974 {{under the name of}} Semotex and it started as a supplier within the <b>graphic</b> <b>industry.</b> When Semotex started to import and sell the hot melt systems, the idea came up to introduce hot melt office binding as a system, where both machines and supplies can be purchased from one supplier and where the two parts are tested and proven to work in combination to provide a good final product. After the invention of the Bindomatic System by Sture Wiholm, the company owner, and Jan Sabelström, the technical manager, Semotex more or less turned over to only produce and sell hot melt office binding. The first binding machine was the Bindomatic 2000.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is {{the description of the}} current actions of European <b>graphic</b> <b>industry</b> to reduce the environmental impact. The revision of the current situation is carried out by reviewing European legislation, private and public initiatives, and actions taken within the national legislation of European Union. Thus, a description of the opportunities and challenges of the European <b>graphic</b> <b>industry</b> is implemented. Moreover, a study of implementation of practices to reduce environmental impact is carried out in a graphic company, called El Tinter. Results of this thesis indicate that the European <b>graphic</b> <b>industry</b> has developed a large number of innovations in order to ensure the sustainability of the industry, but there are remaining issues which require greater accomplishment. In conclusion, {{it is important to note}} that the overall environmental impact of the European <b>graphic</b> <b>industry</b> represents the addition of the individual impacts of stakeholders involved, so the final decrease depends on the sum of collective actions...|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{management}} systems (EMS) {{have been implemented}} mainly in large firms. Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) usually lack capacity to accomplish their environmental systems and would need a practical tool preferably situated in the Internet {{to carry out this}} task. Environmental Internet System (EIS) offers firms an easy way to monitor their environmental issues including industrial and logistics processes. A firm inputs its operational data into a web application and gets information on amounts of materials and substances used in processes, and direct and indirect emissions generated by operations. Benchmarking of emissions and energy and material usage is also incorporated in the program. The pilot application was developed for printing houses. It was tested and further developed by six Finnish printing houses. As a part of the project environmental indicators for <b>graphic</b> <b>industry</b> were also defined.

40|$|The {{literature}} on business strategy and management control often underscores the necessity that companies, in their strategic processes, strive to first set goals and strategies and thereafter conduct investments in organization and technologies. However, some {{scholars argue that}} IT enables and induces strategic change and that these changes are {{necessary in order to}} gain value from the investment. Based on extensive empirical studies of the Swedish <b>graphic</b> <b>industry</b> this paper elaborates on the connection between strategy development and IT utilization. The conclusions are based on a longitudinal study of the <b>graphic</b> <b>industry</b> (1980 - 2010), a complete study of all annual reports from the two market leaders in the industry (1984 - 2010) and a complete study of all board meeting protocols in a newspaper and printing company (1971 - 1989). One conclusion is that there is greater awareness about the implications of IT on the business and the industry than the companies manage to translate in to action. Another conclusion is that the strategic orientation of the owners affects the execution of the IT strategy in the operating units. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how IT and the digitization of information have transformed the Swedish <b>graphic</b> <b>industry.</b> The debate concerning the productivity paradox, i. e. if investments in IT contribute to productivity growth, is one important {{starting point for}} the thesis. Previous research on this phenomenon has mainly used different types of statistical databases as empirical sources. In this thesis though, the <b>graphic</b> <b>industry</b> is instead studied from a mainly qualitative and historical process perspective. The empirical study is focused on describing the development of internal critical production processes in the <b>graphic</b> <b>industry</b> and its external markets. The aim is to show how innovations based upon IT have influenced the transformation of the Swedish <b>graphic</b> <b>industry</b> and if this has led to changes in productivity. Furthermore, to identify other significant effects and changes in the graphic industry’s markets that also has occurred {{as a result of the}} introduction of IT innovations. The process study shows that digitization of information flows in the <b>graphic</b> <b>industry</b> began in the 1970 s, but the start of the development and use of digitized information happened in the early 1980 s. Today almost all types of materials in the industry, for example text and pictures, have developed into a digital form and the information flows are hereby more or less totally digitized. The consequences from use of IT in production processes are identified here as different outcomes and effects. One conclusion drawn from the analysis is that investments and use of IT have positively influenced changes in productivity. The conclusion is based on the appearance of different automational effects, which in turn have had a positive influence on factors that may be a part of a productivity index. In addition to productivity, other mainly informational effects are also identified. These effects include increased capacity to handle and produce information, increased integration of customers in the production processes, increased physical quality in produced products, and options for management improvements in the production processes. The appearance of such effects indicates that it is not always the most obvious ones, such as productivity, that is of greatest significance when IT is implemented in the processes of an industry. Also the part of the study using an external perspective shows that IT innovations have had great influence on the graphic industry’s markets. The transformation of markets is analyzed through the use of the Innovation influence model, which is grounded in the Technological systems and Development blocks concepts. It shows that suppliers to graphic companies have played an important role in the IT innovation development process and they have thereby contributed to the ongoing transformation of the industry. Furthermore, IT innovations have been an important tool for graphic companies to handle different structural tensions they have experienced. The innovations introduced have thereby contributed to the development of new products, distribution channels, and markets. At the same time different products have disappeared and old markets contracted. These progresses have also been a result f the digitization of society. Altogether, this development has resulted in a transformation pressure that has come to greatly influence the industry. Because of this there today exist fewer but larger graphic and suppliers companies. Altogether the study shows that if a productivity paradox existed in the <b>graphic</b> <b>industry,</b> it is today to be considered as resolved. The pace in which the transformation of the industry, caused by IT innovations, has occurred has been extraordinary compared to previous developments. IT has become an unconditional part of the industry and society. Therefore it is of great importance to include several perspectives, e. g., internal process perspectives as well as external market perspectives, when discussing the value that might be derived from IT investments...|$|E
