25|$|Sunshine, as {{with many}} South Atlantic Islands, is low, at a maximum of just 21.5%. This amounts to around 1,000 hours of {{sunshine}} annually. The local topography, however, also contributes significantly to the low insolation. A study published during the early 1960s indicated that sunshine recording instruments remained significantly obscured throughout the year and entirely obscured during June.

40|$|A {{class of}} models is {{proposed}} for longitudinal network data. These models are {{along the lines}} of methodological individualism: actors use heuristics to try to achieve their individual goals, subject to constraints. The current network structure is among these constraints. The models are continuous time Markov chain models that can be implemented as simulation models. They incorporate random change in addition to the purposeful change that follows from the actors' pursuit of their goals, and include parameters that must be estimated from observed data. Statistical methods are proposed for estimating and testing these models. These methods can also be used for parameter estimation for other simulation models. The statistical procedures are based on the method of moments, and use computer simulation to <b>estimate</b> the <b>theoretical</b> moments.
