40|$|PURPOSE: The typical {{manifestations of}} neurocysticercosis are {{described}} widely in the literature. The {{purpose of this}} study is to demonstrate the uncommon presentations of different forms of neurocysticercosis in MR imaging. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of 172 cases of neurocysticercosis in MR studies was carried out over a period of 13 years. One hundred and four males and 68 females with a mean age of 32 ± 3. 7 years were studied. The studies were performed on 1. 5 T GE MR units and T 1 was used before and after gadolinium injection, T 2 and gradient-echo (T 2 *) sequences. RESULTS: The authors divided the unusual manifestations of neurocysticercosis into: intraventricular, subarachnoid, spinal, orbital, <b>intraparenchymatous,</b> and reactivation of previously calcified lesions. The results obtained were: <b>intraparenchymatous</b> 95 cases (55. 23 %); intraventricular 27 cases (15. 69 %); subarachnoid 20 cases (11. 63 %); spinal 6 cases (3. 49 %); orbital 1 case (0. 58 %); reactivated lesion 1 case (0. 58 %); association of intraventricular and <b>intraparenchymatous</b> 12 cases (6. 98 %); association of subarachnoid and <b>intraparenchymatous</b> 6 cases (3. 49 %); association of subarachnoid and intraventricular, 4 cases (2. 32 %). CONCLUSION: MR imaging is a sensitive and specific method in the analysis of different forms of unusual manifestations of neurocysticercosis, which should appear in the differential diagnosis of parenchymal, ventricular, spinal, cisternal, and orbital lesions. OBJETIVO: as manifestações típicas da neurocisticercose já são bem conhecidas. O papel deste estudo foi demonstrar os aspectos incomuns da neurocisticercose na ressonância magnética. MÉTODO: foram analisados 172 casos de ressonância magnética de neurocisticercose na Med Imagem num período de 13 (treze) anos em aparelhos GE de 1. 5 T Signa (Horizon, LX e CVI). Dos casos analisados, foram diversas as formas de apresentação, incluindo intraventricular, intraespinhal, cisternal, orbital, formas atípicas parenquimatosas (simulando tumores), forma miliar e evolução não usual (reativação). CONCLUSÃO: A ressonância magnética é método sensível e específico na avaliação das numerosas formas de apresentação atípica da neurocisticercose, as quais devem constar no diagnóstico diferencial de lesões intraventriculares, cisternais, orbitárias e parenquimatosas...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cerebrovascular {{disease is}} among the leading causes of death in {{developed}} countries. Intracerebral hemorrhage contributes {{a significant number of}} these deaths. Objective: To establish the prognostic value of a set of demographic and tomography variables in patients with nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Methods: A descriptive case series study was conducted. The sample consisted of patients diagnosed with <b>intraparenchymatous</b> and intracerebral hemorrhage admitted in the General University Hospital of Cienfuegos between May 2006 and April 2007. Clinical records were analyzed. In the case of dead patients the autopsy reports were included. Patients were characterized according to demographic and tomographic variables, considered as risk factors for the type of analyzed hemorrhage. Mortality was determined as well as the behaviour of these variables in such cases. Results: 135 patients were included, being 76. 3 % of them over 60 years old. There were no differences according to gender. Patients with non-white skin color were predominant. Intracerebral hemorrhage was more common in patients under 60 years old while <b>intraparenchymatous</b> hemorrage predominated in patients from 75 on. Most voluminous hematomas were detected in intracerebral hemorrhage patients (83. 3 %), as well as hydrocephalus (52. 2 %). The risk of dying from this type of hemorrhage (94. 0 %) was higher than from <b>intraparenchymatous</b> hemmorrage (about 81 %). Conclusions: The highly contributing factors to mortality were: old age, non-white skin color, hydrocephalus and displacement of midline structures for more than 5 mm...|$|E

40|$|Here, {{we provide}} first {{evidence}} that long-term continuous infusion of highly purified antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (S-ODN) into brain parenchyma is well tolerated and thus highly suitable for in vivo application. AP 12009 is an S-ODN for the therapy of malignant glioma. It is directed against human transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta 2) mRNA. In the clinical setting, AP 12009 is administered intratumorally by continuous infusion {{directly into the}} brain tumor. In view of this clinical application, {{the focus of our}} data is on local toxicology studies in rabbits and monkeys to evaluate the safety of AP 12009. AP 12009 was administered either by intrathecal bolus injection into the subarachnoidal space of the lumbar region of both cynomolgus monkeys and rabbits or by continuous <b>intraparenchymatous</b> infusion directly into the brain tissue of rabbits. Intrathecal bolus administration of 0. 1 ml of 500 microM AP 12009 showed neither clinical signs of toxicity nor macroscopically visible or histomorphologic changes. After a 7 -day <b>intraparenchymatous</b> continuous infusion of 500 microM AP 12009 at 1 microl/h in rabbits, {{there was no evidence of}} toxicity except for local mild to moderate lymphocytic leptomeningoencephalitis. Additionally, AP 12009 showed good tolerability in safety pharmacology as well as in acute toxicity studies and 4 -week subchronic toxicity studies in mice, rats, and monkeys.

40|$|We {{studied by}} {{transmission}} electron microscopy an <b>intraparenchymatous</b> mass within white matter found in a patient operated on for cerebral laceration. According to the ultrastructural criteria, this mass was diagnosed as an incipient hemangio-pericytoma, being composed by staghorn vasculature and tumoral cells with appearance of pericytes, more or less phenotipycally changed. The proliferating cells were almost nondifferentiated as well as similar to pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, i. e., heterogenous in their phenotype and “regenerative” in the ultrastructural features. Precise origin and fate of these metabolically active cells is not known. Surprisingly, the microtumor was delineated by numerous reticulin fibers and by long prolongations of cerebral cordocytes, which may have a protective role against tumor growth in the brain parenchyma.

40|$|A 35 -year-old man {{presented}} with one month history of vomitus, dizziness and headache. CT and MR imaging revealed a 3. 5 × 3. 2 cm solitary extra-axial midline mass {{arising from the}} frontal falx cerebri; radiological findings were diagnostic of meningioma of the falx. At surgery, the tumour appeared as an extra-axial lesion and was removed via a left midline frontal craniotomy. Macroscopically, the surgical specimen was whitish, soft, well circumscribed and measured 1. 6 cm in diameter; microscopic features showed a neoplasm with high cellularity, presence of mitotic figures, without necrosis or microvascular proliferation; the neoplasm was reactive for glial fibrillary acidic protein and MIB- 1 index was about 15 %. Given the localization, microscopic features were diagnostic of primary intracranial solitary leptomeningeal astrocytoma (PLA), WHO grade 3. PLA is a very rare lesion that arises in the leptomeninges of the brain or spinal cord with no involvement of <b>intraparenchymatous</b> tissue. Fifteen cases of PLA are reported in the literature.

40|$|Purpose: To {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between morphological characteristics and histologic localization of metastasis within sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) and axillary spread in women with breast cancer. Methods: We selected 119 patients with positive SLN submitted to complete axillary lymph node dissection from July 2002 to March 2007. We retrieved the age of patients and the primary tumor size. In the primary tumor, we evaluated histologic and nuclear grade, and peritumoral vascular invasion (PVI). In SLNs we evaluated the size of metastasis, their localization in the lymph node, number of foci, number of involved lymph nodes, and extranodal extension. Results: Fifty-one (42. 8 %) patients had confirmed additional metastasis in non-sentinel lymph nodes (NLSN). High histologic grade, PVI, <b>intraparenchymatous</b> metastasis, extranodal neoplastic extension and size of metastasis were associated with positive NLSN. SLN metastasis affecting the capsule were associated to low risk incidence of additional metastasis. After multivariate analysis, PVI and metastasis size in the SLN remained {{as the most important}} risk factors for additional metastasis. Conclusions: The risk of additional involvement of NSLN is higher in patients with PVI and it increases progressively according the histologic localization in the lymph node, from capsule, where the afferent lymphatic channel arrives, to the opposite side of capsule promoting the extranodal extension. Size of metastasis greater than 6. 0 mm presents higher risk of additional lymph node metastasis...|$|E

40|$|Intracranial {{pressure}} (ICP) monitoring {{has become}} "state of the art" {{in the management}} protocol for unconscious or sedated patients with intracranial pathologies; however, all current monitoring systems have significant drawbacks. We analyzed the complications of these monitoring devices {{as well as the}} risk factors for those complications. We reviewed a total of 288 patients with ICP monitoring, i. e., 173 external ventricular drainage (EVD) and/or 123 <b>intraparenchymatous</b> catheters (IPCs). Placement of the IPC or EVD was performed by a standardized protocol according to fixed anatomical landmarks. Infections were diagnosed from positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures, positive devices cultures, and/or fever; hemorrhages were diagnosed by postprocedure computed tomography. Sixteen patients (9. 2 %) with an EVD and 1 patient (0. 8 %) with an IPC system experienced an infection (P <  0. 01). Factors associated with a greater risk for infections include subarachnoid hemorrhage (10 patients, 9. 4 %), intraventricular hemorrhage (7 patients, 8. 6 %), and concomitant catheters (6 patients, 3, 5 %). Mean monitoring time was 3. 9 days (range 1 - 17 days), with the greatest incidence of infections between day 5 and 11. Intracerebral hemorrhage was seen in 2 patients with EVD and in 1 patient with IPC (P < 0. 01). None of these patients needed surgical evacuation of the blood clot. EVD is an indispensable device in neurosurgery. Unfortunately, it has a significantly high complication rate, mostly in relation to infections. Therefore, the indication of the device used to monitor ICP must be evaluated carefully. The antimicrobial-impregnated external catheter and silver-coated catheters might decrease the problem of infection...|$|E
40|$|Context: Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is {{the leading}} cause of death in the first year of life in {{developed}} countries. Brazilian and Latin American literature lack studies on the subject, which is largely unknown among health workers. Objective: To identify cases that could be classified as SIDS among children of less than one year of age submitted to autopsy at the Serviço de Verificação de Óbitos do Interior (SVOI), in Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil. A retrospective analysis of all autopsies from SVOI in this age group from January 1987 to December 1990 was done. Results: There were 369 autopsies of which 344 (93. 2 %) deaths were expected and 25 (6. 8 %) unexpected. From the 25 unexpected cases 16 (64 %) deaths could not be explained after autopsy and from these cases only 10 were eligible for the study because they had full organ sampling. There were 7 males and 3 females and the age at death ranged from 1 to 3 months (average: 1. 7 months). Two were found dead, 3 died at home, 4 died on the way to hospital and 1 died while being fed. Autopsy diagnoses were aspiration (8 cases), SIDS (1 case) and undetermined (1 case). Aspiration was not confirmed by histology and the only findings were mild pulmonary edema, subcapsular petechiae and <b>intraparenchymatous</b> hemorrhage in thymus. Conclusion: That there were 10 cases of unexpected and unexplained deaths of children less than 1 year-old during the evaluated period with characteristics similar to SIDS which should therefore be classified as such.

40|$|Inflammatory pseudotumors (IPs), mostly benign lesions {{characterized}} by fibrotic ground tissue and polyclonal mononuclear infiltrate, may affect all organ systems. IPs {{originating in the}} central nervous system (IP-CNS) are very rare, and their distinct histopathologic features are poorly characterized. Three otherwise healthy patients (age 8, 15, and 17 years) presented with focal neurologic symptoms (seizures, n = 2; headaches, n = 1), corresponding to a left temporal, left occipital, and left frontal IP, respectively, extending from meningeal structures into brain tissue. After resection, no recurrence was observed in patient 1 during 5 years of follow-up, whereas patient 2 developed a rapidly progressive local recurrence and a second intracerebral lesion despite antiviral, immunosuppressive, antibiotic, and radiation therapy. In patient 3, who also showed local recurrences, sequential histopathologic investigations revealed transformation to a semimalignant fibrohistiocytic tumor. In this patient, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) expression was also positive, whereas it was negative in patient 1. A detailed literature analysis confirmed that most IP-CNS arise from dural/meningeal structures (n = 34). <b>Intraparenchymatous</b> (n = 7), mixed intraparenchymatous/meningeal (n = 4), and intraventricular lesions (n = 7) or IP extending per continuitatem from intracerebral to extracerebral sites (n = 5) were rare. The recurrence rate was 40 % within 2 years in general. It was increased after incomplete resection and in female patients (multivariate Cox regression model, P < 0. 02). Although rare, IP-CNS are important differential diagnoses among tumor-like intracranial lesions. Their potential risk of malignant transformation and high risk of recurrence necessitate close follow-up, especially when resection is incomplete. Prospective multicenter trials are needed to optimize classification and treatment of this rare inflammatory lesion. Copyright 2003, Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Aims: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the value of superficial (intradermal) and paratumoral (above the tumor) (ID) injection of labeled colloids for imaging sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) as a rescue technique in breast cancer patients for whom deep (<b>intraparenchymatous)</b> and peritumoral (around the tumor) (IP) injections had failed. Methods: We assessed data from 2 groups of women: 469 women for whom IP injections successfully visualized a SLN (IP-only) and 52 women for whom IP injections were unsuccessful and ID injection was performed (IP 0 -ID). Patient characteristics and SLN results were compared. Results: Most characteristics of the two patients series were similar. However, IP 0 -ID patients were on average 10 years older than the IP-only patients and had more grade-III tumors. The false negative rate (FNR) for the IP 0 -ID patients (9 / 25, 23. 8 %) was significantly higher than for the IP-only patients (12 / 240, 5 %; p < 0. 01) and for a subgroup of IP-only patients older than 50 years (8 / 159, 5 %; p = 0. 009). Four of five false negatives in the IP 0 -ID group involved a tumor in the outer quadrants. The FNR for cases with external tumors was 33 % for the IP 0 -ID patients, a percentage significantly higher than the corresponding values for the IP-only patients (5. 8 %) and for the IP-only patients older than 50 years (5. 7 %). Conclusion: In patients with unsuccessful deep IP injections, superficial ID injections lead to a high percentage of false negative SLN conclusions, merely when tumours were located in the outer quadrants. Thus, it is recommended that patients with unsuccessful intra-parenchymatous and peritumoral injections of radiocolloids for tumors in outer quadrants undergo complete axillary dissection. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This work introduces an alternative method to the {{study of the}} bronchial tree, with five stages applicable to humans and rest of the mammals, characterized for being inexpensive, simple, brief and effective. As an example, the domestic rabbit (oryctolagus cunniculus) has been used to illustrate the method. The study focuses on the injection of the bronchial tree using silicone to obtain molded pieces that can be used for further analysis or as learning material. 1) Stage of dissection: 21 adult rabbits, no sex distinction, cardiopulmonary blocks were removed. 2) Stage of silicone injection: the tracheobronchial tree lumen was filled with semi-solid silicone. 3) Stage of maceration: the preparations were placed in a hydrogen peroxide solution in order to decompose the biological tissues. 4) Data gathering phase: in order to follow a structured process for observation the molded pieces were numbered and analyzed according to an "observer's guide" that establishes the proper order for the study of variations. 5) Data processing and conclusion drawing phase: a digital spreadsheet was used to obtain the results that were then compared to the established bibliography. During this study there are registered: 4 (19 %) development variations, 3 (14, 3 %) supernumerary bronchi, 2 (9, 5 %) hypoplasias, 1 (4, 8 %) agenesia. This method provides the means to properly and efficiently deliver results that are consistent with the related bibliography.

40|$|Abstract Background Medical {{literature}} has increasingly {{reported cases of}} maternal brain death during pregnancy. This is a rare situation which demands the decision and, depending on the gestational age, {{the implementation of a}} set of measures to prolong the homeostasis of the human body after brain death for the purpose of maintaining the foetus alive until its viability. Case presentation A 40 year old woman suffered an intracranial haemorrhage during the 25 th week of pregnancy. Despite neurosurgical drainage of a gross <b>intraparenchymatous</b> haematoma, the patient developed brain death. Upon confirmation of this diagnosis, she received full ventilatory and nutritional support, vasoactive drugs, maintenance of normothermia, hormone replacement and other supportive measures required to prolong gestation and improve the survival prognosis of her foetus. All decisions regarding the patient's treatment were taken in consensus with her family. She also received corticosteroids to accelerate foetal lung maturity. During the twenty-five days of somatic support, the woman's condition remained stable; however, during the last seven days the foetus developed oligohydramnios and brain-sparring, which led the medical team to take the decision to perform a Caesarean section at that moment. After delivery, the patient's organs were removed for donation. The male infant was born weighing 815 g, with an Apgar score of 9 and 10 at the first and fifth minutes, respectively. The infant was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, but did not require mechanical ventilation and had no major complications. He was discharged at 40 days of life, with no sequelae and weighing 1850 g. Conclusion These results are in accordance with findings from previous studies and case reports suggesting the appropriateness and safety of extended somatic support during pregnancy under certain circumstances. They also suggest the need for prompt diagnosis of brain death before the occurrence of physiological degeneration, rapid evaluation of foetal status and the decision of the family together with the medical team to prolong maternal somatic support.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hematoma {{expansion}} {{has been}} associated with mortality and poor clinical outcome in patients with <b>Intraparenchymatous</b> hemorrhage (IPH). The presence of contrast extravasation (spot sign) detected by CT angiography (CTA) has been considered a good predictive radiologic marker of the hematoma’s expansion and clinical outcome. Despite its good sensibility, a 20 % of patients with negative spot sign undergo with posterior hematoma expansion. On the other hand, some studies showed the presence of hypoperfusion in perihematomal area and have tried to relate it to the perihematomal edema. Although there hasn’t been found a correlation between hypoperfusion and perihematomal edema, neither have hypoperfusion and hematoma expansion been studied and correlated with clinical severity and clinical outcome. PURPOSE: The aim {{of this study is to}} know whether the perfusion CT increases the sensitivity detecting spot sign as well as to know whether the perihematomal hypoperfusion is associated with subsequent growth of the hematoma and its impact on the prognosis of patients. DESIGN: The study will be an observational prospective cohort study with a duration of 3 years, performed in Josep Trueta Hospital in Girona, Spain. POPULATION: The study population will be all the patients with diagnosis of acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage with a proven initial NCCT scan realized on the emergency department admission and of < 12 hours of evolution. A non-probabilistic consecutive sampling will be conducted expecting to gather a minimum sample of 155 patients. The two cohorts (positive and negative spot sign) will be followed in time to analyze hematoma expansion. METHODS: Patients will be studied by a baseline cranial non-contrast CT, perfusion CT and CTA and a non-contrast CT at 24 and 72 hours. The CTA and PCT will assess the presence of spot sign and the difference between the baseline CT and the 24 -hours and 72 -hours CT will determine the hematoma expansion. Neurological deficit will be evaluated by NIH stroke scale on admission, at 24 hours, 72 hours, 7 days and 90 days after onset. Functional impairment will be assessed by m-Rankin Scale previous to onset and at 90 day...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hydrocephalus causes {{impaired}} gait, balance, cognition and continence, all {{of which}} can be reversed by shunt treatment. Adjustable valves are commonly used in the shunt treatment of hydrocephalus but randomized controlled trials (RCT) are scarce. The aim of the present thesis was to evaluate adjustable valves in the treatment of hydrocephalus. Patients and Methods: In Study I, 450 hydrocephalus patients undergoing primary shunt insertion were followed over 10 years to investigate the short-term perioperative risk factors of shunt surgery. In Study II the relationship between intracranial pressure (ICP) and ICP wave amplitude (AMP), valve settings and body positions were studied in 15 hydrocephalus patients. During the shunt operation an <b>intraparenchymatous</b> ICP-sensor was simultaneously inserted and ICP/AMP analyzed with the shunt ligated and when opened at different opening pressures and body positions. A double-centered RCT was conducted in studies III and IV, including 68 patients with iNPH. The patients received a ventricular shunt and were randomized into two groups; in one group (20 - 4) the valve was initially set to 20 cm H 2 O and gradually reduced to 4 cm H 2 O {{over the course of the}} 6 month study period. In the other group (12), the valve setting was kept at a medium level of 12 cm H 2 O during the whole study period. In study III the time to and type of complications and overdrainage symptoms were recorded. In Study IV clinical variables were continuously compared between the two groups. Results: In total, 538 patients were included and the six month shunt revision rate was 19 %. Fifty-four percent of the patients received adjustable valves. Both adjustable valves and right frontal placement of the shunt were associated with a lower shunt revision rate, but not independently. ICP and AMP decreased significantly when the shunt was opened but the difference in ICP between the highest and lowest valve settings (in vivo) was smaller than previous measurements in vitro. Gradual reduction of the valve setting from 20 to 4 cm H 2 O neither improved clinical outcome nor the complication rate, compared to a fixed valve setting at 12 cm H 2 O. The clinical improvement was seen within 3 months postoperatively. Conclusions: Gradual reduction of the valve setting from a high to a low level neither improved the clinical outcome nor the complication rate, compared to a fixed valve setting at medium level. The pressure window in an adjustable valve is narrower in vivo than in vitro. ICP in the upright position is significantly different from the supine position. Right frontal shunt placement and the use of adjustable valves were associated with a lower shunt revision rate, but a coincidence of these two variables was found...|$|E
