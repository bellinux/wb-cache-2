Lamason also built a rapport with two other prisoners; French {{scientist}} Alfred Balachowsky and Dutch Olympian trainer Jan Robert. Both men had developed trustworthy contacts within the camp administrative area and were able to provide Lamason with reliable intelligence that assisted in the survival of the airmen.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Ray Davies dived {{headlong into}} the {{theatrical}} style, {{beginning with the}} rock opera Preservation, a sprawling chronicle of social revolution, and a more ambitious outgrowth of the earlier Village Green Preservation Society ethos. In conjunction with the Preservation project, the Kinks' line-up was expanded to include a horn section and female backup singers, essentially reconfiguring the <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> theatrical troupe.|$|E
5|$|In general, apeomyines are a {{widespread}} but generally rare group of dentally distinctive eomyids with a tendency towards large size. Fejfar and colleagues suggested that apeomyines were ecologically distinct from other eomyids and probably preferred a drier habitat. Although other scientists recognized Apeomyinae as a subfamily, in a 2008 summary of North American eomyids, Lawrence Flynn placed the <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tribe, Apeomyini, within the subfamily Eomyinae. Flynn described Apeomyoides {{as the most}} derived apeomyine.|$|E

5|$|Migratory {{birds of}} the {{subspecies}} P. d. bactrianus in the P. d. indicus group were recorded overlapping with P. d. domesticus birds without hybridising in the 1970s, so the Soviet scientists Edward I.

However, P. d. indicus-group and P. d. domesticus-group birds intergrade in a large part of Iran, so this split is rarely recognised.|$|E

5|$|Delivered to the United States Army Air Forces on 19 March 1945, Bockscar was {{assigned}} to Captain Frederick C. Bock and crew C-13, and flown to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah in April. The name chosen for the aircraft, and painted on it after the mission, was a pun on {{the name of the}} aircraft commander. It left Wendover on 11 June 1945 for Tinian, where it arrived 16 June. It was originally given the Victor (unit-assigned identification) number 7 but on 1 August was given the triangle N tail markings of the 444th Bombardment <b>Group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> security measure, and had its Victor changed to 77 to avoid misidentification with an actual 444th aircraft.|$|E
5|$|During battle, {{the player}} can {{converse}} with enemies, {{though they are}} restricted to a single set of dialogue options instead of four as in the original Persona. If the player succeeds in talking with the enemy using the right character, it both causes the enemy to leave the battlefield and gains a spell card (a Tarot card linked {{to one of the}} Arcanum or family of Personas), which can be used to create Personas in a location called the Velvet Room. In the Velvet Room, the player can summon a new Persona that belongs to a spell card's particular Persona family <b>group.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> character gains experience levels, more powerful Personas from a spell card's group become available. In addition to pre-set spell cards, the player can also obtain blank skill cards by forming contracts with enemies through the right conversation. These blank skill cards can be tailored to fit a chosen Persona family.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Fear of Music in 1979, Talking Heads and Eno sought to make an album that would dispel notions of the <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mere vehicle for {{frontman}} and chief lyricist David Byrne. Drawing {{on the influence of}} Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, the group experimented with African polyrhythms, funk, and electronics, recording instrumental tracks as a series of sampled and looped grooves, an innovative technique at the time. Recording sessions also incorporated a variety of side musicians, including guitarist Adrian Belew, singer Nona Hendryx, and trumpet player Jon Hassell.|$|E

The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued the <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success, despite having sold more than 85 million records worldwide and becoming one of the world's best-selling music artists of all time. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in their first year of eligibility. R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, announcing the split on its website.|$|E
