5|$|Fanny Longfellow died in {{the home}} in July 1861 after <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> accidentally caught fire; her husband {{attempted}} to quell the flames, managing to keep her face from burning. Longfellow himself was burned on his own face and was scarred badly enough that he began growing a beard to hide it.|$|E
5|$|Although van der Weyden did not title the work, and the sitter's {{name is not}} {{recorded}} {{in any of the}} early inventories, the style of <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> has been used to place the picture very late in van der Weyden's career. The c.1460 dating is based on the high-fashion dress and the work's apparent chronological position in the evolution of van der Weyden's style. However, it is possible that it was executed even later (van der Weyden died in 1464).|$|E
50|$|<b>Her</b> <b>dresses</b> {{have been}} worn by various models, for example at the Danish preselections of Miss Universe. Other {{well-known}} people have also worn <b>her</b> <b>dresses,</b> such as Eivør Pálsdóttir.|$|R
50|$|The Symphony soon {{realized}} {{that it had no}} accommodations for its female musicians. The only other female, a harp player, offered to share her harp's case, which she used as <b>her</b> <b>dressing</b> room. Dwyer declined and was assigned a spare green room as <b>her</b> <b>dressing</b> room. In an interview with flutist James Galway, she noted that the interview was taking place in <b>her</b> original <b>dressing</b> room.|$|R

5|$|As {{with other}} early van der Weyden {{depictions of the}} Madonna, her head is {{slightly}} too large for her body. <b>Her</b> <b>dress</b> is creased and almost paper-like. However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if she had only one leg. This seems to reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in the depiction of a body under clothing.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1851, women in several states were wearing the dress in public. In March, Amelia Bloomer, editor of the temperance {{newspaper}} The Lily, announced that she was wearing it and printed a description of <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> along with {{instructions on how to}} make it. Soon, newspapers had dubbed it the “Bloomer dress”, and the name stuck.|$|E
5|$|On May 10, 1999, Debra won the Women's Championship from Sable in an Evening Gown match. Usually, in an Evening Gown match, {{the woman}} who {{forcibly}} removes her opponent's dress wins. Because Sable removed Debra's dress, she therefore {{should have been the}} winner. Commissioner Shawn Michaels, however, ruled that he considered {{the woman who}} had lost <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> the winner, crowning Debra the new Women's Champion. Debra lost the Women's Title to Ivory on June 14, due to interference from Nicole Bass.|$|E

5|$|The {{film is a}} {{partially}} fictionalised account {{of the relationship between}} Alfred Hitchcock and Tippi Hedren. In 1961, Hitchcock notices Hedren in a television commercial for a diet drink. He wants to turn her into the next Grace Kelly, with whom he had worked extensively during the 1950s. Hedren passes her screen test and is groomed for the starring role in Hitchcock's latest film, The Birds; the director instructs her about <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> and appearance.|$|E
5|$|About a {{month before}} the race took place, in February 2015, the race organisers {{published}} a publicity poster for the race. This poster showed a woman, with <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> raised and underwear with the race logo visible. A cyclist's gloved hand was reaching out apparently to pinch the woman's bottom. The poster bore the caption Wie knijpt ze in Harelbeke? ("Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?"). This was a reference to Peter Sagan's actions after the 2013 Tour of Flanders, when he pinched the bottom of Maja Leye during the podium ceremony after the race.|$|E
5|$|Anna has {{distinguishable}} {{facial features}} of a typical Disney heroine, including big eyes, thin lips and a small nose. Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even has them on her shoulders. Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of magenta, black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs {{on the bottom of}} <b>her</b> <b>dress.</b>|$|E

5|$|Her {{green eyes}} {{were meant to}} symbolize nature and also served as another {{contrast}} to Tifa's brown eyes. Nomura did not change much of Aerith's design for Advent Children, but her design was updated in Kingdom Hearts with the removal of her bolero jacket, which made her attire appear more as Amano had originally drawn her. Other changes included the addition of bracelets and a belt. Nomura modified <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> in Before Crisis, adding white and green colors, and this version was also {{used as the basis}} for her design in Kingdom Hearts II.|$|E
5|$|Mary sits under a brocade canopy or {{cloth of}} honour, painted in brown hues which have since {{discoloured}} to dark green. The canopy hangs {{down to a}} wooden bench attached to the wall behind her. Mary's hair is loose and she wears an embroidered dress lined with fur. Around her neck is a light veil, and she {{is shown in the}} act of nursing. <b>Her</b> <b>dress</b> is a centrepiece of the panel, composed of a variety of blues overlaid with lead white and deep blue lapis lazuli highlights. The inner parts of her robe contain violet coloured fabrics, lined with greyish blues and purples.|$|E

Nausicaä, <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> drenched blue with Ohm blood, walks atop hundreds of golden Ohm tentacles as through golden fields, fulfilling the saviour's prophecy. The Ohm and Tolmekians leave the Valley, and the Pejites remain with the Valley people, helping them to rebuild. Deep underneath the Toxic Jungle, a non-toxic tree sprouts next to Nausicaä's lost aviation goggles.|$|E

5000|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to break into the}} US market in the 1990s <b>her</b> <b>dresses</b> were sold with other British designers, and sold as [...] "The Designer Collection". <b>Her</b> <b>dresses</b> are sold in global cities such as New York City and Chicago, [...] London and Tokyo, and she has Rena Koh Collections stores in Boca Raton, Florida and on James Road in Tyseley, Birmingham in the UK. <b>Her</b> <b>dresses</b> {{appeared}} at the debut edition of the New York Bridal Apparel Show in April 1994 {{and was one of the}} busiest booths with visitors on display. In 2004, her designer bridal gowns were nominated for a national DEBI Award, alongside gowns by the likes of Eve of Milady, Lazaro, and Monique Lhuillier.|$|R

5|$|The woman {{wears an}} elegant low-cut black dress with dark bands of fur {{at the neck}} and wrist. Her clothes are of the then-fashionable Burgundian style, which emphasises the tall and thin {{aesthetic}} of the Gothic ideal. <b>Her</b> <b>dress</b> is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in below her breasts. The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention {{to the structure of}} the clothing—the careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its position—is typical for the artist.|$|E
5|$|The woman's veil forms {{a diamond}} shape, {{balanced}} by the inverse flow of a light vest worn beneath <b>her</b> <b>dress.</b> She is shown at a slight angle, but her pose is centred by the interlocked broad lines of arms, décolletage and veil. The woman's head is delicately lit, leaving no strong tonal contrasts on her skin. She has a long, thin face, plucked eyebrows and eyelids, and a plucked hairline to create a fashionably high forehead. Her hair is tightly pinned back {{on the rim of}} the bonnet and rests above her ear. Her high headdress and severe hairline accentuate her elongated face, giving it a sculpted appearance.|$|E
5|$|Christus frames his sitter in a {{rigid and}} {{balanced}} architectural setting. She is positioned within a narrow rectangular space, before a wainscotted wall. The image is {{divided by the}} horizontal parallel lines of her wainscot and blouse, which join at the inverted triangle formed by the neckline of <b>her</b> <b>dress.</b> The rendering of the background departs somewhat from contemporary conventions in portraiture: Christus sets the girl against a dark brown wall with little detail, {{in contrast to the}} elaborate interiors of Jan van Eyck, who is often regarded as Christus' master. It is defined entirely by its material, a wooden dado rail along the top and the wainscot that forms the lower portion. The wall sets her in a realistic interior, perhaps intended to represent a space within her home.|$|E

5|$|In the Prapancasarasara-samgraha, Dhumavati is {{described}} as having a black complexion and wearing ornaments made of snakes. <b>Her</b> <b>dress</b> is made of rags taken from cremation grounds. She holds a spear and a skull-cup (kapala) in her two hands. The spear is sometimes replaced by a sword. Another description in the same text says Dhumavati is aged with a wrinkled, angry face and cloud-like complexion. Her nose, eyes, and throat resemble a crow's. She holds a broom, a winnowing fan, a torch, and a club. She is cruel and frowning. Her hair appears dishevelled and she wears the simple clothes of a beggar. Her breasts are dry. Her hair is grey, her teeth crooked and missing, and her clothes old and worn.|$|E
5|$|Longfellow {{was born}} in Portland, Maine, which was then still part of Massachusetts. He studied at Bowdoin College. After {{spending}} time in Europe, he became a professor at Bowdoin and, later, at Harvard College. His first major poetry collections were Voices of the Night (1839) and Ballads and Other Poems (1841). Longfellow retired from teaching in 1854, to focus on his writing. He lived {{the remainder of his}} life in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a former Revolutionary War headquarters of George Washington. His first wife Mary Potter died in 1835, after a miscarriage. His second wife Frances Appleton died in 1861, after sustaining burns when <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> caught fire. After her death, Longfellow had difficulty writing poetry for a time and focused on translating works from foreign languages. He died in 1882.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{frequently}} noted {{the parallels between}} the three hunting scenes and the three seduction scenes in Gawain. They are generally agreed that the fox chase has significant parallels to the third seduction scene, in which Gawain accepts the girdle from Bertilak's wife. Gawain, like the fox, fears for his life and {{is looking for a}} way to avoid death from the Green Knight's axe. Like his counterpart, he resorts to trickery in order to save his skin. The fox uses tactics so unlike the first two animals, and so unexpectedly, that Bertilak has the hardest time hunting it. Similarly, Gawain finds the Lady's advances in the third seduction scene more unpredictable and challenging to resist than her previous attempts. She changes her evasive language, typical of courtly love relationships, to a more assertive style. <b>Her</b> <b>dress,</b> relatively modest in earlier scenes, is suddenly voluptuous and revealing.|$|E
