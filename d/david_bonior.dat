25|$|On January 9, 2009, {{national}} news media {{reported that the}} {{five of the seven}} CtW unions had met with seven of the largest unions in the AFL-CIO in talks which explored the possibility of the five CtW unions rejoining the larger labor federation. Impetus for the talks came as the Obama administration signalled to both labor federations that it preferred to deal with a united rather than fragmented labor movement. Also, several Change to Win unions also concluded that they were not getting any significant advantage from being in a separate labor federation, and that a fragmented labor union was doing more harm than good. <b>David</b> <b>Bonior,</b> a former U.S. Congressman who once led the AFL-CIO's American Rights at Work division and {{who was a member of}} Barack Obama's presidential transition team, facilitated the meeting, and said talks were scheduled to last several weeks. The five CtW unions present included the Laborers, SEIU, the Teamsters, UFCW, and UNITE HERE. AFL-CIO unions present included AFSCME, the AFT, the Electrical Workers, the UAW, and the United Steelworkers. Also in attendance was Dennis Van Roekel, president of the National Education Association, which is independent and belongs to neither group.|$|E

2500|$|After the 2000 United States Census, the Michigan Legislature reconfigured the state's congressional map. In the process, they redrew the 10th District, {{represented}} by 13-term Democrat <b>David</b> <b>Bonior.</b> The old 10th {{had been a}} fairly compact district taking in most of Macomb and St. Clair counties. However, the reconfigured 10th was pushed {{all the way to}} the Thumb. In the process, the legislature moved Miller's home in Harrison Township into the district, while shifting Bonior's home in Mount Clemens to the neighboring 12th District. Bonior opted to run for the governor of Michigan rather than run for re-election to the House of Representatives. Miller won the Republican primary, and in the general election in November she handily beat Carl Marlinga, the Macomb County Prosecutor since 1982. Marlinga called himself a [...] "Hubert Humphrey Democrat", and Miller called herself a [...] "George W. Bush Republican."

The south end of St. Clair Shores and about 80% of Eastpointe were put in the district that ended up being <b>David</b> <b>Bonior's</b> district, {{while the rest of}} Eastpointe, as well as the remaining areas in Warren, Center Line, Maidson Heights, Hazel Park, Sterling Heights, Utica and Troy were merged into the district that ended up represented by the 17th district's representative Sander Levin.|$|R

5000|$|Dannin's {{most recent}} book is Taking Back the Workers' Law: How to Fight the Assault on Labor Rights, with a forward by former Congressman <b>David</b> E. <b>Bonior</b> (2006).This book {{discusses}} court and NLRB rulings that have, in her view, undermined the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by stacking the deck against employees in their negotiations with employers. Among these are rulings on replacement of striking workers [...] and implementation upon impasse (the doctrine that, at an impasse in negotiations, the employer may unilaterally implement their last offer). Dannin argues that labor attorneys should show the courts how these rulings undermine the goals that Congress wrote into Section 1 of the NLRA; these goals include equality of bargaining power between employees and employers, and the right of employees to join unions and to bargain collectively over terms and conditions of employment.|$|R

5000|$|From 1980 to 1990, Stenholm was reelected without major-party opposition, even running unopposed in 1980 {{and from}} 1984 to 1990.

However, in 1994, Stenholm was held to only 53 percent of the vote against an unknown Republican in an election that saw dozens of other moderate and conservative Democrats toppled. Indeed, when his children heard the initial returns, they were so certain he'd lost that they traveled to the family farm to console him. Afterwards, he ran for House Minority Whip, losing to <b>David</b> E. <b>Bonior.</b> [...] While he was reelected four more times after that, he never crossed the 60 percent mark again, and was nearly defeated in 1996 and 2002.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of History, Washington State UniversityIn April 1985 the Reagan {{administration}} {{asked for}} $ 14 million in nonmilitary Contra aid. The House of Representatives rejected the request {{by a vote}} of 215 to 213. Shocked CIA director William Casey credited non-governmental organizations (NGOs) saying, "If Tip O'Neill didn't have Maryknoll nuns who wrote letters, we would have a contra program. " The Reagan administration's efforts to discredit, harass, and discredit various NGO's throughout the 1980 s showed how powerful they believed the movement of NGOs to be. Finally, after the House of Representatives narrowly voted down renewed funding for the Contras in February 1988, both the leaders of the anti-Contra aid and the Contra aid backers credited or blamed NGOs for the defeat of Contra funding. This study examines how and why NGOs were able to play a decisive role in the decision making of United States foreign policy over the Sandinista-Contra conflict in Nicaragua. This study defines NGOs as a non-state actor who attempted to influence United States foreign policy, and focuses on NGOs that were propelled by altruism rather than profit. Some of these groups were formed specifically to influence United States foreign policy; for example, Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), Witness for Peace, and Countdown 87. Others, like individual churches and denominations, believed that influencing foreign policy fit within their preexisting purposes to work for the peace and prosperity of citizens of every nation. After years of trial and error these religious and humanitarian organizations found that they could influence United States foreign policy with a mixture of grass roots organizing, strategic alliances with political parties, and targeted political pressure. This study primarily utilized the papers of Democrat Representative <b>David</b> <b>Bonior</b> and House Speaker, Tip O'Neill, who kept extensive records of the efforts of various NGOs who worked to change US foreign policy. It also examined published works from members of the Reagan Administration, debates in congress, US government publications, and influential US periodicals who reported on the major actors of the US policy toward Nicaragua as Congressional debates unfolded.
