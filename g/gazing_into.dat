5|$|The Siddheshwara {{temple in}} the Haveri {{district}} has sculptures of deities of multiple faiths. The temple {{may have been}} consecrated first as a Vaishnava temple, later taken over by Jains and eventually becoming a Shaiva temple. The hall in the temple contains sculptures of Uma Mahesvara (Shiva with his consort Uma), Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi, Surya (the sun god), Naga-Nagini (the snake goddess), and the sons of Shiva, Ganapati and Kartikeya. Shiva is depicted with four arms, holding his attributes: the damaru (drum), the aksamala (chain of beads) and the trishul (trident) in three arms. His lower left arm rests on Uma, who is seated on Shiva's lap, embracing him with her right arm while <b>gazing</b> <b>into</b> his face. The sculpture of Uma is well decorated with garlands, large earrings and curly hair.|$|E

25|$|Painters {{depicting}} someone <b>gazing</b> <b>into</b> {{a mirror}} often also show the person's reflection. This {{is a kind}} of abstraction—in most cases the angle of view is such that the person's reflection should not be visible. Similarly, in movies and still photography an actor or actress is often shown ostensibly looking at him- or herself in the mirror, and yet the reflection faces the camera. In reality, the actor or actress sees only the camera and its operator in this case, not their own reflection.|$|E

25|$|The title L'Oiseau bleu (The Blue Bird) can {{be traced}} back to a French {{literary}} fairy tale by Madame d'Aulnoy (1650/1651 – 4 January 1705), published in 1697. When d'Aulnoy termed her works contes de fées (fairy tales), she originated the term that is now generally used for the genre. Prince Charming, in the story, is transformed by the fairy godmother into a blue bird. Aside from the subject of the title of Madame d'Aulnoy's story, there is further iconographic evidence in Metzinger's painting that suggests a link between the two. The first relates to the woman <b>gazing</b> <b>into</b> a mirror on the left side of Metzinger's painting.|$|E
25|$|The {{figures in}} the four panels of the lower {{register}} are all positioned within uniform niches. The outer panels show the donors Joost Vijdt and his wife Lysbette Borluut. The inner panels contain grisaille paintings of Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist. The grisaille is used to give the illusion of sculpture and imply that these are cult representations of the two saints before which the donors kneel, <b>gazing</b> <b>into</b> the distance with their hands clasped together in veneration. As with {{the most of the}} other panels on the inner and outer views, they are lit from the right. Shadows thrown by the figures establish depth, and bring realism to both the faux statues and painted niches.|$|E
25|$|The video {{opens with}} a shot of running water. Rihanna is then {{presented}} undressing and climbing into a bathtub. Throughout {{the rest of the}} video, the singer is presented nude in the tub full of cloudy green water; subtle camera angles protect her modesty. Rihanna is shown wearing little make-up and with long hair tangled and wet over one side of her face. The singer seems morose and sad as she occasionally flickers her eyes to the ceiling and puts her head in her hands, showing off long manicured nails and a diamond stud earring. The low-key video also features Mikky Ekko, who performs his parts of the song separately including scenes of him {{perched on the edge of}} a different bathtub, <b>gazing</b> <b>into</b> a mirror, in front of an unlit fireplace, and sitting on a grand chair. The video switches between the pair throughout the course of the video until it concludes with a single tear falling from Rihanna's eye as she sinks lower into the bathtub.|$|E

500|$|Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe {{described}} Jenny stating: [...] "Dreary, confused, introverted narcissist [...] downcast, secretive, almost Goth in {{her black}} moodiness, she {{is the epitome of}} an unhappy egotist. She is so consumed with {{the ups and downs of}} her own depression and self-loathing, she just doesn't have the energy to look outward. Her misery is her mirror, and she's forever <b>gazing</b> <b>into</b> it." [...] New York Magazine describe Jenny as a capricious yet obnoxious type of character adding that she can be patronizing. They also observe her as looking [...] "fabulous, fun, and sexy but her downfall is her annoying side." [...] Diane Shipley of The Guardian branded Jenny a [...] "whiny egomaniac". Lesbian magazine Curve brands Jenny a [...] "narcissistic navel-gazer".|$|E
500|$|Williams and Barlow {{performed}} [...] "Shame" [...] for {{the first}} time on 12 September 2010 at the Help for Heroes concert held in London. On 2 October the duo sang the song at the series eight of the Strictly Come Dancing. A Metro newspaper critic reviewed the performance and wrote, [...] "the pair, wearing matching black suits, spent much of the early stages of their performance sitting on stools and <b>gazing</b> <b>into</b> each other’s eyes as they sung the duet." [...] On 7 October, Williams and Barlow were chatting at the BBC Radio 1 where they gave a performance of the song. The singers were guests at the Paul O'Grady Live chat show and also performed the single on 8 October. Three days after, on 11 October, they gave a rendition of the track on the morning television programme, Daybreak. On 18 November the pair performed the song on the German reality TV programme, [...] Barlow included [...] "Shame" [...] on the set list of his 2014 tour, Since I Saw You Last, where he performed a solo acoustic version of the song.|$|E
500|$|Consecutively, {{during the}} song's bridge, Carey {{watches as the}} small child's mother carries her to a nearby {{playground}} where her friends are frolicking and playing. Similarly, the elderly man is met with some other elderly citizens, who accompany him to another building nearby. During the song's climax, Carey joins the choir, flailing her hands wildly towards the sky, and smiling and <b>gazing</b> <b>into</b> the cloudy morning. Renee Graham from The Boston Globe gave the video two out of four stars. She complimented {{on the fact that}} the video captured the song's lyrical essence and how it managed to portray it in a clear and concise way. Although calling it [...] "simple," [...] Graham commented that [...] "Videos have never really been Mariah Carey's thing, and frankly, they've never had to be. Carey has a killer voice, so the last thing she'd want to do is overshadow her singing with a lot of choreography, complicated story lines or explosions." [...] Author Chris Nickson compared several parts of the video to religion and belief in God. During such scenes when Carey appears with the choir, he felt it seemed as though they were both channeling a common entity through music; God. Additionally, he claimed it was more evident with each passing scene of the video, as each of the lonely people in the video gaze up into the skies, possibly praying or searching for an answer to their loneliness. A video was commissioned for the C+C club mix of the song. Known as the C+C video edit, it was also directed by Danielle Federici and serves as a behind the scenes addendum to the main music video. It is also filmed in black and white, and is composed of clips of Carey and her friends during filming of the video, where they chat, laugh and enjoy time with each other. Carey's husband at the time Tommy Mottola made a cameo appearance in the video, appearing alongside Carey during the second verse. The remix video was later included on the 1995 home video release, [...]|$|E

2500|$|Another {{form of the}} tale, {{involving}} the same actions of <b>gazing</b> <b>into</b> a mirror in a darkened room, {{is used as a}} supernatural dare in the tale of [...] "Bloody Mary".

2500|$|Rituals {{that involve}} many acts similar to scrying in {{ceremonial}} magic are {{retained in the}} form of folklore and superstition.

2500|$|The opening stanzas {{evoke the}} poet <b>gazing</b> <b>into</b> the fire imagining a primeval forest older than myth, [...] "before the fauns". But his {{traumatic}} experiences on the Western Front intrude on his somewhat romantic meditation: [...] "Wrote a poem on the Colliery Disaster: but I {{get mixed up}} with the War at the end. It is short, but oh! sour." [...] The gently hissing coals recall the moans of the dying miners [...] "writhing for air"; and Owen intertwines their death with that of soldiers at the front, imagining heaps of white bones in the fire's ashes and [...] "muscled bodies charred". Yet in the future, the centuries will still doze by the fire, its coals themselves formed out of [...] "rich loads", of groans and toil in the dark pits of war. The coming years, preserved in their rooms like insects in amber will be oblivious {{of the millions of}} dead lads - soldiers and miners - buried under the earth.|$|E
2500|$|In Jackson's series, Sauron is {{originally}} {{portrayed as}} a towering [...] "black knight" [...] wielding a huge black mace (reminiscent of Tolkien's descriptions as well as conceptual artist John Howe's illustrations of Morgoth); in this form, he is portrayed by Sala Baker. While Tolkien never specifically discussed the type of armour, Sauron is shown in spiky plate armour of very high quality: it has very ornate filigree but is also quite functional. In the DVD commentary, the production team explained their intent was to represent Sauron's great skill as a craftsman and ring-maker: [...] Sauron was originally a maia spirit in service to the smith-vala Aulë, and thus was very wise in the lore of physical construction. [...] Sauron may have fallen from his previously angelic state, but a shadow of his great skill in forging and construction remains, {{even though it has}} been twisted to making weapons of war. [...] Thus they chose to depict Sauron as wearing frightening, but very high quality and ornate armour of his own creation. Sauron's body disintegrates with explosive force after Isildur cuts off the Ring with the hilt-shard of the sword Narsil. Sauron's spiritual essence remained intact as it eventually consolidates into the Eye of Sauron by the time of Barad-dûr's restoration, stationing himself between the twin horn-like spires above the tower to scan Mordor like a searchlight. The effect in Mordor is seen as a red beam that moves across the land, forever probing. It also seems to be visible to Frodo (and to see him in turn) any time that he is wearing the Ring. Pippin has a brief encounter with the Eye, after <b>gazing</b> <b>into</b> the palantír of Orthanc. In the extended edition of The Return of the King, Sauron's humanoid form appears when Aragorn looks into the palantír. When the Ring is destroyed, the Eye of Sauron collapses in on itself, causing a massive shock wave that destroys his entire kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{wanted to}} marry her but she refused all stating, 'I will go to Kham and there lives a great yogi who is descended from the noble clan of the Kyura race. This yogi I will marry and our sons and daughters and future generations will be {{extraordinary}} persons who will benefit all sentient beings by spreading {{the essence of the}} Buddha's teachings.' Then accompanying a merchant, she traveled to Kham. [...] They arrived at a place called Dentod Tsonrur and she said to her companion, 'This is the place I have to stay.' She departed and went to meet the great saint Ame Tsultrim Gyatso to whom she said, 'Although I have no attachment to the worldly life, if we join together our descendants will bear many enlightened beings who will do great benefit for the teachings of the Buddha.' [...] On their marriage day, Ame Tsultrim Gyatso did not have any possessions to arrange for the ceremony. Drolma said, 'Do not worry, I will take care of it.' So saying she miraculously pulled a damaru from her right pocket and a kapala from her left. Then beating the damaru and holding the kapala in her hand she made a mystic dance while <b>gazing</b> <b>into</b> the sky. [...] Immediately the house was filled with the finest food and drink and the richest garments with which to clothe themselves - thus giving great satisfaction and pleasure to all the guests. [...] They lived together and in time she gave birth to four sons: Namkhe Wangchuk, Pekar Wangyal, Sonam Pal and Kathung Trushi. These sons were exceptionally intelligent and became scholars on both the temporal and spiritual levels. [...] Of her four sons, Pekar Wangyal fathered four sons. They were Khenpo Dharma, Konchog Rinchen, Tsunpo Bar and Naljor Dorje - of these four, Naljor Dorje became the father of the great Ratnashri Jigten Sumgon, the great Drikungpa, who was the reincarnation of Nagarjuna.|$|E
