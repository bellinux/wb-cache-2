Because more than one million taxpayers were burdened by such assessments, research to reduce the errors is worth considering. ...|$|R

Part II broadens the time frame to analyze the regimes of religious exemption â€“ federal and state, constitutional and statutory [...] in which such disputes play out. Such regimes will tend to be rhetorically strong and experientially weak, with an occasional outburst of religion-protecting vigor. Burwell v.
