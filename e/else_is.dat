5|$|B.integrifolia {{produces}} a dark amber-coloured honey of middling quality and therefore low commercial value.

50|$|Elser's {{apparent}} preferential treatment, {{which included}} extra rations and daily {{visits to the}} camp barber for a shave, aroused interest amongst other prisoners, including British SIS officer, Payne Best. He wrote later that <b>Elser</b> <b>was</b> also allowed regular visits to the camp brothel. Martin Niemöller was also a special inmate in the Sachsenhausen ‘bunker’ and believed the rumours that <b>Elser</b> <b>was</b> an SS man and an agent of Hitler and Himmler. Even though Elsa Härlen married another man in December 1939, Elser kept a photo of her in his cell. In early 1945, <b>Elser</b> <b>was</b> transferred to the bunker at Dachau concentration camp.|$|R

Most authors suggest it is a somewhat evolved star such as a supergiant or giant, although a Wolf–Rayet star cannot be ruled out.|$|E
