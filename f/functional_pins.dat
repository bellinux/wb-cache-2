40|$|Modern {{science of}} {{networks}} has brought significant advances {{to our understanding}} of complex systems biology. As a representative model of systems biology, Protein Interaction Networks (PINs) are characterized by a remarkable modular structures, reflecting functional associations between their components. Many methods were proposed to capture cohesive modules so that there is a higher density of edges within modules than those across them. Recent studies reveal that cohesively interacting modules of proteins is not a universal organizing principle in PINs, which has opened up new avenues for revisiting <b>functional</b> modules in <b>PINs.</b> In this paper, <b>functional</b> clusters in <b>PINs</b> are found to be able to form unorthodox structures defined as bi-sparse module. In contrast to the traditional cohesive module, the nodes in the bi-sparse module are sparsely connected internally and densely connected with other bi-sparse or cohesive modules. We present a novel protocol called the BinTree Seeking (BTS) for mining both bi-sparse and cohesive modules in PINs based on Edge Density of Module (EDM) and matrix theory. BTS detects modules by depicting links and nodes rather than nodes alone and its derivation procedure is totally performed on adjacency matrix of networks. The number of modules in a PIN can be automatically determined in the proposed BTS approach.

In this study we have generated a backcross (BC) population of 210 individuals where 5 A- 5 A m homeologous recombination was induced by the ph 1 b mutation to recover individuals with a reduced translocated segment.

40|$|The {{plant hormone}} auxin is a mobile signal which affects nuclear {{transcription}} by regulating {{the stability of}} auxin/indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) repressor proteins. Auxin is transported polarly from cell to cell by auxin efflux proteins of the PIN family, {{but it is not}} as yet clear how auxin levels are regulated within cells and how access of auxin to the nucleus may be controlled. The Arabidopsis genome contains eight PINs, encoding proteins with a similar membrane topology. While five of the PINs are typically targeted polarly to the plasma membranes, the smallest members of the family, PIN 5 and PIN 8, seem to be located not at the plasma membrane but in endomembranes. Here we demonstrate by electron microscopy analysis that PIN 8, which is specifically expressed in pollen, resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and that it remains internally localized during pollen tube growth. Transgenic Arabidopsis and tobacco plants were generated overexpressing or ectopically expressing <b>functional</b> <b>PIN</b> 8, and its role in control of auxin homeostasis was studied. PIN 8 ectopic expression resulted in strong auxin-related phenotypes. The severity of phenotypes depended on PIN 8 protein levels, suggesting a rate-limiting activity for PIN 8. The observed phenotypes correlated with elevated levels of free IAA and ester-conjugated IAA. Activation of the auxin-regulated synthetic DR 5 promoter and of auxin response genes was strongly repressed in seedlings overexpressing PIN 8 when exposed to 1 -naphthalene acetic acid. Thus, our data show a functional role for endoplasmic reticulum-localized PIN 8 and suggest a mechanism whereby PIN 8 controls auxin thresholds and access of auxin to the nucleus, thereby regulating auxin-dependent transcriptional activity...|$|R

In this study we generated <b>functional,</b> fluorescent protein-tagged <b>PIN</b> 6 proteins and performed comprehensive analysis of their subcellular localization and also performed a detailed <b>functional</b> characterization of <b>PIN</b> 6 and its developmental roles.

Transport and metabolic profiling assays in cultured cells and Arabidopsis strongly suggest that PIN 6 mediates both auxin transport across the PM and intracellular auxin homeostasis, including the regulation of free auxin and auxin conjugates levels. As evidenced by the loss- and gain-of-function analysis, the complex function of PIN 6 in auxin transport and homeostasis is required for auxin distribution during lateral and adventitious root organogenesis and for progression of these developmental processes. These results illustrate a unique position of PIN 6 within the family of PIN auxin transporters and further add complexity to the developmentally crucial process of auxin transport...|$|R

FOXM 1 activity correlated with expression of the enzyme Pin 1, which we found to be indicative of a poor prognosis. In <b>functional</b> experiments, <b>Pin</b> 1 proved to be a main regulator of FOXM 1 activity through MEK-dependent physical regulation during the cell cycle. The Pin 1 -FOXM 1 interaction was enhanced by BRAF V 600 E, the driver oncogene in the majority of melanomas, and in extrapolation of the correlation data, interference with Pin 1 in BRAF V 600 E-driven metastatic melanoma cells impaired both FOXM 1 activity and cell survival. Importantly, cell-permeable Pin 1 -FOXM 1 -blocking peptides repressed the proliferation of melanoma cells in freshly isolated human metastatic melanoma ex vivo and in three-dimensional-cultured patient-derived melanoids.

40|$|Medulloblastoma is {{the most}} common {{malignant}} brain tumor in children. Therapeutic approaches to medulloblastoma (combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) have led to significant improvements, but these are achieved at a high cost to quality of life. Alternative therapeutic approaches are needed. Genetic mutations leading to the activation of the Hedgehog pathway drive tumorigenesis in ~ 30 % of medulloblastoma. In a yeast two-hybrid proteomic screen, we discovered a novel interaction between GLI 1, a key transcription factor for the mediation of Hedgehog signals, and PIN 1, a peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase that regulates the postphosphorylation fate of its targets. The GLI 1 /PIN 1 interaction was validated by reciprocal pulldowns using epitope-tagged proteins in HEK 293 T cells as well as by co-immunoprecipiations of the endogenous proteins in a medulloblastoma cell line. Our results support a molecular model in which PIN 1 promotes GLI 1 protein abundance, thus contributing to the positive regulation of Hedgehog signals. Most importantly, in vivo <b>functional</b> analyses of <b>Pin</b> 1 in the GFAP-tTA;TRE-SmoA 1 mouse model of Hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma demonstrate that the loss of Pin 1 impairs tumor development and dramatically increases survival. In summary, the discovery of the GLI 1 /PIN 1 interaction uncovers PIN 1 as a novel therapeutic target in Hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma tumorigenesis...|$|R
40|$|Brassinosteroids (BRs) are {{important}} plant growth regulators in multiple developmental processes. Previous {{studies have indicated}} that BR treatment enhanced auxin-related responses, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Using 14 C-labeled indole- 3 -acetic acid and Arabidopsis thaliana plants harboring an auxin-responsive reporter construct, we show that the BR brassinolide (BL) stimulates polar auxin transport capacities and modifies the distribution of endogenous auxin. In plants treated with BL or defective in BR biosynthesis or signaling, the transcription of PIN genes, which facilitate functional auxin transport in plants, was differentially regulated. In addition, BL enhanced plant tropistic responses by promoting the accumulation of the PIN 2 protein from the root tip to the elongation zone and stimulating the expression and dispersed localization of ROP 2 during tropistic responses. Constitutive overexpression of ROP 2 results in enhanced polar accumulation of PIN 2 protein in the root elongation region and increased gravitropism, which is significantly affected by latrunculin B, an inhibitor of F-actin assembly. The ROP 2 dominant negative mutants (35 S-ROP 2 -DA/DN) show delayed tropistic responses, and this delay cannot be reversed by BL addition, strongly supporting the idea that ROP 2 modulates the <b>functional</b> localization of <b>PIN</b> 2 through regulation of the assembly/reassembly of F-actins, thereby mediating the BR effects on polar auxin transport and tropistic responses...|$|R
