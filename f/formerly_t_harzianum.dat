Trichoderma harzianum biotype 4 was identified by RAPD analysis as the cause of almost 90 % of the epidemic-related episodes of green mold occurring in the major commercial mushroom-growing region in North America. Biotype 4 was more closely allied to T. harzianum biotype 2, the predominant pathogenic genotype in Europe, than to the less pathogenic biotype 1 and Trichoderma atroviride (<b>formerly</b> <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> biotype 3). No variation in the RAPD patterns was observed among the isolates within biotype 2 or 4, suggesting that the two pathogenic biotypes were populations containing single clones. Considerable genetic variation, however, was noted among isolates of biotype 1 and T. atroviride from Europe. Biotype 4 was not represented by the preepidemic isolates of Trichoderma as determined by RAPD markers and PCR amplification of an arbitrary DNA sequence unique to the genomes of biotypes 2 and 4. Our findings suggest that the onset of the green mold epidemic in North America resulted from the recent introduction of a highly virulent genotype of the pathogen into cultivated mushrooms...|$|E

40|$|The {{biological}} control of Sclerotium cepivorum, the causal agent of onion white rot, by Trichoderma <b>harzianum</b> and <b>T.</b> virens was studied in a glasshouse trial. <b>T.</b> <b>Harzianum</b> (isolates C 52 and D 73) and T. virens (isolate GV 4) afforded early season disease control {{when applied to}} the soil as a bulk carrier (sand:bran:fungal mix, 1 : 1 : 2) {{at the time of}} planting. <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> C 52 gave extended control to 12 weeks after planting, {{but by the end of}} the trial, disease pressure was extreme (98 %) and none of the treatments gave continuous control. Similar results were found in the field, where <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> C 52 was unable to control onion white rot disease under high disease pressure (87 %). The results of these disease control trials suggested that <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> may be better applied as part of an integrated disease management programme rather than alone. Ecological studies were undertaken with <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> C 52 and S. cepivorum to optimise application strategies. <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> C 52 was both rhizosphere and rhizoplane competent when introduced into the soil as a seed coat (0. 2 x 10 ¹ to 1. 8 X 10 ² cfu/g soil) and a bulk carrier (7. 5 x 10 ³ to 3. 6 X 10 ⁵ cfu/g soil) in a 16 week pot trial. Under field conditions, the addition of commercial formulations of <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> C 52 (Trichopel and Trichodry) prepared by Agrimm Technologies Ltd. to the planting furrow enabled <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> C 52 to establish in the rhizosphere. Proliferation in the rhizosphere was formulation dependent with Trichopel maintaining concentrations greater than 10 ⁵ cfu/g soil for the majority of the 19 week trial compared with 10 ³ cfu/g soil for the Trichodry formulation. A molecular marker was developed using the molecular biology technique UP-PCR. Initially, genetic variation between <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> and Trichoderma isolates was studied and a band profile was identified for <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> C 52 that enabled this isolate to be distinguished from other Trichoderma isolates present in the soil. The combination of unique morphological characteristics, genetic fmgerprinting and selective sampling of the rhizosphere allowed <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> isolates recovered at the field site to be identified with a 95 % degree of certainty. A complementary study examined the delivery of <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> C 52 in transplant potting mix. <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> C 52 successfully colonised the rhizosphere of onion transplants when Trichodry was incorporated with potting mix and populations were similar to those achieved in the field with a direct seeded crop (10 ³ cfu/g soil). In vitro assays were conducted to determine possible modes of action of <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> in the field. <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> C 52 significantly reduced the mycelial growth of S. cepivorum colonies in dual culture and prevented three of the four S. cepivorum isolates tested from producing sclerotia. Competition was determined as a likely mode of action for <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> C 52. Previous studies indicated that antibiosis was also a mode of action as this isolate was shown to produce the antimicrobial metabolite six-pentyl-a-pyrone (6 P AP) (Dodd-Wilson, 1996; McLean, 1996). Therefore, it was postulated that <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> C 52 controls onion white rot by colonising the rhizosphere, out-competing S. cepivorum for nutrients and space and by producing 6 PAP, to reduce S. cepivorum mycelial growth. S. cepivorum preferential infection sites on onion roots were studied to determine if the planting furrow was optimum for delivering <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> to soil for root protection. Sclerotia banded at 1, 10 and 20 cm depths in soil germinated and infected onion roots at 5, 7 and 13 weeks after planting, respectively. A second trial determined that the severity of infection varied when sclerotia were placed at the stem base, along the length of a root and at the root tip. A significantly greater number of stem base infections led to total plant collapse compared with infections occurring along the length of a root or at the root tip. As the stem base infections would contribute the most to yield losses, targeting <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> to the planting furrow should protect the stem base from infection. The fungicide sensitivity of <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> C 52 was studied to determine the compatibility of this fungus with fungicides routinely used on onion crops. In vitro assays determined that <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> C 52 mycelium was highly sensitive to half, normal and twice the recommended field rate concentrations of captan, benomyl, thiram, iprodione and carbendazim. The spore sensitivity assay showed that 100 % of the <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> C 52 spores were prevented from germinating when exposed to mancozeb, copper oxychloride, tebuconazole, thiram and the combination of mancozeb and metalaxyl. A selection of the most commonly used fungicides were applied to <b>T</b> <b>harzianum</b> C 52 infested soil. All fungicides initially reduced the <b>T</b> <b>harzianum</b> C 52 concentration (2. 2 x 10 ³ - 3. 4 X 10 ⁴ cfu/g soil), but numbers quickly recovered within 12 days except for mancozeb formulations, where the population took longer (30 days) to recover. These results indicate that <b>T</b> <b>harzianum</b> would be compatible with most fungicides used on onion crops, except thiram and mancozeb. The use of soil solarisation was considered as part of an integrated disease management programme to reduce sclerotial viability and, thereby, relieve disease pressure. Eight week solarisation trials in Canterbury and Blenheim reduced sclerotial viability to 31. 5 and 0 %, respectively, when sclerotia were contained in polyester mesh bags. The addition of a mixture of soil and sand to the bags with the sclerotia further reduced sclerotial viability to 8. 7 % in Canterbury. The combination of sub-lethal temperatures and lethal temperatures for short periods were responsible for the decrease in sclerotial viability. Soil temperature data from New Zealand's three main onion growing regions indicated that soil solarisation would be applicable in all regions to relieve disease pressure...|$|R

So, the effect of the biofungicide, Trichoderma harzianum on the crayfish, Procambarus clarkii and its influence on electrophretic pattern of proteins and tissue pathology of gonads were studied. Different concentrations of <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> (100, 50, 40, and 20 %) were used. The potency of <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> to genocide ranged from many hours (less than a day) with 100 % concentration to 39 day of treated with 20 % concentration. Electrophoretic analysis was done to compare protein patterns of muscles from control and treated animals with 20 % <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum.</b> The result recorded decrease in protein density of males and females post exposure to <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> after one week (this decrease was more in males than females). However, the protein density increased four weeks post exposure to <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> (this increase was more in females than in males). <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> caused some histobathological changes in testis after four weeks post exposure when compared to the control. The testis showed deformed architecture, some testicular acini showed incomplete fusion and others with elongated shape.

A study was conducted to investigate the interactive effect of the plantgrowth promoting fungi Trichoderma harzianum and the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in growth and development of tomato (Solanun lycopersicum) seedlings grown under greenhouse conditions. A 3 × 3 factorial experiment was laid out in a completely randomised design with six replications. At harvest (42 DAP), when compared with the control, <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> and/or AMF treated plants improved shoot length, root length, dry shoot mass and dry root mass. Pre-inoculation with AMF increased shoot N, P and S content of tomato seedlings, whereas pre-sowing with <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> alone increased the shoot N. Generally, shoot Zn and Mn content were affected by both fungi, with the best result observed when AMF was applied 2 weeks after <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum.</b> The percentage of roots colonised by AMF was less than 15 % regardless of the time when <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> was applied. However, the percentage of roots colonised by <b>T.</b> <b>harzianum</b> was greater than 90 % at all times.
