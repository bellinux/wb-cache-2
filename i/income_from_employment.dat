The student loan exclusion for those who do certain types of work is designed to maximize that benefit. There have been lobbying efforts to amend 108(f)(1) for those who get total and permanent disability discharges, since under Department of Education rules, such borrowers are subject to a three-year post-discharge review period during which their <b>incomes</b> <b>from</b> <b>employment</b> cannot exceed the poverty line.|$|R
