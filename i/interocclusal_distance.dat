40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the <b>interocclusal</b> <b>distance</b> during the pronunciation of /m/ and /s/ sounds from Portuguese Language, in partially edentulous patients before and after new partial and total prosthesis installation. The subjects were divided into two groups: Experimental group, consisting of 9 patients entirely edentate in the upper maxillary arch and classified as Kennedy Class I in the lower arch; and Control group, consisting of 9 totally dentate patients. The subjects from the first group had their worn out dentures changed and the occlusal vertical dimension (OVD) corrected. A magnetic method of jaw tracking was used to measure the <b>interocclusal</b> <b>distance</b> (mm) during pronunciation of those phonemes. Comparison between groups, by t test, showed significant difference (p< 0. 05) for /m/ sound in all periods of time: before prosthesis installation - T 0 (3. 38 ± 1. 23), immediately - T 1 (2. 15 ± 1. 06), six hours - T 2 (3. 41 ± 1. 33), twenty-four hours - T 3 (2. 92 ± 0. 92), two days - T 4 (4. 80 ± 1. 93), one week - T 5 (3. 87 ± 1. 43), two weeks - T 6 (3. 03 ± 0. 96), one month - T 7 (3. 03 ± 0. 96), two months - T 8 (4. 47 ± 1. 45) and three months - T 9 (4. 33 ± 2. 56), except for six months - T 10 after prosthesis installation. For /s/ sound phoneme the results were different (p< 0. 05) between the groups in T 1 (2. 89 ± 1. 33), T 2 (3. 37 ± 1. 22), T 3 (3. 19 ± 1. 06), T 4 (3. 86 ± 1. 21), T 5 (3. 83 ± 1. 32), T 6 (3. 27 ± 1. 10), T 7 (3. 37 ± 0. 99) and T 10 (3. 84 ± 1. 38) after oral rehabilitation. The paired-t test, for means comparison between before and after prosthesis insertion, indicated significant differences (p< 0. 05) for /m/ sound only in T 1, and for /s/ sound in T 1, T 2, T 3, T 6, T 7 and T 10. It was concluded that new prosthesis insertion, correcting the OVD, changes the <b>interocclusal</b> <b>distance,</b> and for /m/ sound this distance could be recovered after six months of prosthesis wearing...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of a correct vertical dimension of occlusion {{is a critical}} procedure in clinical dentistry. The objectives {{of this study were}} to analyze the relation between mandibular rest position and electrical activity of masticatory muscles and to compare clinical and electromyographic rest position in subjects with different vertical facial morphologic features. Clinical rest position and electromyographic rest position were investigated in 40 subjects. Electromyographic rest position ranged from 0. 4 to 12. 7 mm (average 7. 7 +/- 2. 7 mm). Clinical rest position ranged from 0. 1 to 4. 4 mm (average 1. 4 +/- 1. 1 mm). The average difference between electromyographic rest position and clinical rest position was 6. 3 +/- 2. 5 mm (range 0. 3 to 10. 3 mm). Sixteen subjects were selected according to the Frankfort mandibular plane angle and separated in two groups having a mandibular plane angle > or = 28 degrees. Rest position was significantly greater (p < 0. 05) in the low-angle group (2 +/- 1. 3 mm) than in the high angle group (0. 8 +/- 0. 8 mm). Electromyographic rest position did not differ between subjects with different facial morphologic features (8. 1 +/- 1. 7 mm low-angle group; 7. 6 +/- 4. 1 mm high angle group). By varying the vertical dimension millimeter by millimeter, masseter and anterior temporal electromyographic activity demonstrated a considerable decrease over an <b>interocclusal</b> <b>distance</b> of 3 to 4 mm. Further mandibular opening up to 18 mm corresponded to small changes in postural activity.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{literature}} on accuracy and clinical performance of computer technology applications in surgical implant dentistry. Materials and Methods: Electronic and manual literature searches were conducted to collect information about (1) the accuracy and (2) clinical performance of computer-assisted implant systems. Meta-regression analysis was performed for summarizing the accuracy studies. Failure/complication rates were analyzed using random-effects Poisson regression models to obtain summary estimates of 12 -month proportions. Results: Twenty-nine different image guidance systems were included. From 2, 827 articles, 13 clinical and 19 accuracy studies were included in this systematic review. The meta-analysis of the accuracy (19 clinical and preclinical studies) revealed a total mean error of 0. 74 mm (maximum of 4. 5 mm) at the entry point in the bone and 0. 85 mm at the apex (maximum of 7. 1 mm). For the 5 included clinical studies (total of 506 implants) using computer-assisted implant dentistry, the mean failure rate was 3. 36 % (0 % to 8. 45 %) after an observation period of at least 12 months. In 4. 6 % of the treated cases, intraoperative complications were reported; these included limited <b>interocclusal</b> <b>distances</b> to perform guided implant placement, limited primary implant stability, or need for additional grafting procedures. Conclusion: Differing levels and quantity of evidence were available for computer-assisted implant placement, revealing high implant survival rates after only 12 months of observation in different indications and a reasonable level of accuracy. However, future long-term clinical data are necessary to identify clinical indications and to justify additional radiation doses, effort, and costs associated with computer-assisted implant surgery...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the association of speaking space of /s/ sound with vertical and horizontal overlaps for two subject groups. Group I comprised 61 subjects with complete permanent dentition and Group II comprised 33 complete denture wearers. They had their mandibular movement determined by using an electromagnetic method. Speaking space of /s/ was obtained from each subject as they were instructed to say the word 'seis' three times. The mean <b>interocclusal</b> <b>distance</b> during /s/ production was considered the speaking space of /s/. Vertical and horizontal incisor overlaps were also measured. The mean value of speaking space of /s/ was 2. 22 mm (± 1. 38) for Group I and 2. 61 mm (± 1. 53) for Group II. In Group I, significant correlations were found between the speaking space of /s/ and vertical overlap (r= 0. 36, P< 0. 01), and between speaking space of /s/ and horizontal overlap (r= 0. 45, P< 0. 01). In Group II, no significant correlation was found between speaking space of /s/ and the overlaps. It was concluded that incisor overlap had a direct influence on the measure of speaking space of /s/ for dentate subjects, but this association was not present for complete denture wearers...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeIn maxillary defects with a {{significant}} vertical component, {{the reconstruction of the}} alveolar process is advisable in order to avoid disproportionate long implant supported crowns. This article evaluates the safety and efficacy of the treatment of the atrophic posterior maxilla with the three-dimensional reconstruction technique with autologous bone graft associated to the sinus lift technique in the same procedure. The unique approach for the recipient site was a sub-periosteal mucosal tunnel made through a single vestibular vertical incision. This approach avoids exposure and resorption, the main complications in on-lay grafting. Materials and methodsThis retrospective study included 12 cases of atrophic posterior maxilla treated consecutively with this combined technique between January 2011 and July 2012. The alveolar crest was reconstructed to a minimum width of 6 mm, increasing its height and decreasing the <b>interocclusal</b> <b>distance</b> to achieve the established success criteria of accurate insertion of implants equal or larger than 3. 8 mm diameter and 11 mm length. ResultsThe average gain in bone height was 4. 54 mm. Implant surgery was carried out 4 months after augmentation. A total of 25 implants were inserted with a 96 % success. Patients were followed-up for an average of 18 months after grafting. ConclusionsTreatment of atrophic posterior maxilla with three-dimensional reconstruction, sinus lift and “tunnel” approach, is an effective technique that provides reliable and stable results, enabling dental rehabilitation with suitable implant supported crowns...|$|E
40|$|When {{treatment}} {{planning an}} increase in VDO a dental articulator is used to orient the maxillary and mandibular casts in centric occlusion. The incisal pin can be raised to increase the proposed VDO. This results in more inter-occlusal distance between the anterior teeth than the posterior because of the ?arc of closure?. Several studies have mentioned this variation in inter-occlusal distance in the posterior teeth compared to the anterior teeth, specifically at the molar region and central incisors. Rebibo et al, proposed a ?Rule of Thirds? explaining that for the same vertical variation, molar height, incisal edge and anterior pin are proportional. The ?Rule of Thirds? states that for a 3 mm increase at the incisal pin, we obtain a 2 mm increase at the incisors and 1 mm increase between molars. ? The purpose of this in vivo study was to: 1. Evaluate {{the validity of the}} ?Rule of Thirds? for facebow-mounted casts on a dental articulator. 2. Assess differences between Angle Class I and II occlusions. The null hypothesis was there would be no statistically significant difference in {{the findings of this study}} and previous studies regarding the ?Rule of Thirds?, and there would be no statistically significant difference in the ?Rule of Thirds? between Angle Class I and II occlusions. Thirty participants were selected and impressions of the maxillary and mandibular arches were made with irreversible hydrocolloid. A facebow record was made and casts were mounted in centric relation on a SAM 3 dental articulator. The <b>interocclusal</b> <b>distance</b> at the second molar was set at 1 mm, and measurements at the central incisors, and incisal pin were recorded for data analysis. Within the limitation of this in vivo study, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1. There was no significant difference between the findings of this study and previous studies regarding the ?Rule of Thirds?. 2. There was no significant difference in the incisal vertical point, incisal horizontal point, and incisal pin point, between Angle Class I and II occlusions. 3. The inter-occlusal distance ratio of the second molar to the vertical overlap of the central incisor and incisal pin was approximately 1 : 1. 8 : 2. 9 on the SAM 3 articulator. 4. The inter-occlusal distance ratio of the second molar to the horizontal overlap of the central incisor was approximately 1 : 0. 8...|$|E
