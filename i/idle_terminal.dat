In [39], a cooperative relaying mechanism is proposed under a modified Vickrey auctioning strategy where a mobile phone serves as a relay for downlink transmission trading the expended energy on relaying for an economic reward. The reason for using a Vickrey model as the auctioning model is that the bidders, given the mechanism rules, are obliged to give a real value to the goods they trade [39], which allows a fair exchange. As we can see, this mechanism permits to reduce the transmission energy needed for the BSs systems that as we know is the most critical device into the mobile network in terms of consumption. Other references, on the contrary, give proposals but applied for the uplink. In [40], it is proposed to use close terminals to transmit data cooperatively to a common BS. When a given user is transmitting, a close <b>idle</b> <b>terminal</b> may decide to collaborate into transmission, becoming a relay that transmits a second stream increasing the transmission rate of the active user and reducing therefore the energy used per bit transmitted (i.e. ECR, see Section 2). A Nash bargaining approach is used to achieve the cooperation assuming that mobile terminals behave selfishly and therefore a motivation is needed. The Nash equilibrium here can be reached if an infinite-stage game is performed. Other publications study the inherent energy-efficient advantages of relaying compared to direct transmission. For instance, the study of [41] conducts an analysis of wireless relays, Coordinated Multipoint Transmission (CoMP) and the classic BS-MS point-to-point transmission. In the schemes analysed, the BS/relay sleep mode feature is included. From this analysis, some conclusions are drawn: (i) increasing the BS density and reducing the cell size leads to better results in terms of energy efficiency {{for any of the}} mechanisms considered, and (ii) wireless relays must have a reduced consumption compared to a BS in order to be an option of being an energy-efficient mechanism. In [42], some transmission mechanisms using direct transmission and relaying are analysed with the additional consideration of having at their disposal the capabilities of average channel state feedback or instantaneous channel state feedback. The results of this article show that cooperative relaying must be used when outage probability target is very low, in order to enhance energy efficiency. On the contrary, for less exigent outage probabilities it is advised to use direct link transmission. In any case the fact of introducing instantaneous channel knowledge features into a transmission mechanism is a key for reduced energy consumption. This latter could be implemented by using the sensing capabilities of the CR, as we will see in Section 5.|$|E

40|$|This letter {{presents}} a novel opportunistic cooperative positioning approach for orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems. The basic {{idea is to}} allow <b>idle</b> mobile <b>terminals</b> (MTs) opportunistically estimating the arrival timing of the training sequences for uplink synchronization from active MTs. The major advantage of the proposed approach over state-of-the-arts is that the positioning-related measurements among MTs are performed without the paid of training overhead. Moreover, Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is utilized to derive the positioning accuracy limit of the proposed approach, and the numerical {{results show that the}} proposed approach can improve the accuracy of non-cooperative approaches with the a-priori stochastic knowledge of clock bias among idle MTs...|$|R
40|$|Design {{techniques}} and procedures to improve performances of radio-frequency and millimeter-wave front-end integrated circuits were developed. Power amplifiers for high data-rate wireless communication applications were designed using CMOS technology employing a novel device resizing and concurrent power-combining technique {{to implement a}} multi-mode operation. Comprehensive analysis on the efficiency degradation effect of multi-input-single-output combining transformers with <b>idle</b> input <b>terminals</b> was performed. The proposed discrete resizing and power-combining technique effectively enhanced the efficiency of a linear CMOS power amplifier at back-off power levels. In addition, a novel power-combining transformer that is suitable to generate multi-watt-level output power was proposed and implemented. Employing the proposed power-combining transformer, a high-power linear CMOS power amplifier was designed. Furthermore, receiver building blocks such as a low-noise amplifier, a down-conversion mixer, and a passive balun were implemented using SiGe technology for W-band applications.

40|$|Abstract—To {{ensure a}} {{long-lived}} network of wireless communicating sensors, {{it is necessary}} to have a medium access control protocol that is able to prevent energy-wasting behaviour like <b>idle</b> listening, hidden <b>terminal</b> problem or collision of packets. Schedule-based medium access protocols are in general robust against these effects, but require a mechanism to establish nonconflicting schedules. We present such a scheduling mechanism, which allows wireless sensors to choose a time interval for transmission, which is not interfering or causing collisions with other transmissions. We analyze the scheduling mechanism in the case that many nodes enter the time interval selection procedure simultaneously and potentially multiple selection rounds are required before each node has a non-conflicting schedule. In our proposed solution, we do not assume any hierarchical organization in the network and all operation is localized, making the network self-configuring. I...|$|R

We empirically show that our localized algorithm is suc-cessful within a factor 2 of the minimum necessary time slots in random networks; well in range of the expected (worst case) factor 3 -approximation of known first-fit algorithms. Our algorithm assures similar minimum distance between simultaneous transmissions as CSMA(/CD) -based approaches. 1...|$|R
40|$|Spectrum sensing is an {{important}} issue in cognitive radio networks. The unlicensed users can access the licensed wireless spectrum only when the licensed wireless spectrum is sensed to be <b>idle.</b> Since mobile <b>terminals</b> such as smartphones and tablets are popular among people, spectrum sensing can be assigned to these mobile intelligent terminals, which is called crowdsourcing method. Based on the crowdsourcing method, this paper studies the distributed scheme to assign spectrum sensing task to mobile terminals such as smartphones and tablets. Considering the fact that mobile terminals’ positions may influence the sensing results, a precise sensing effect function is designed for the crowdsourcing-based sensing task assignment. We aim to maximize the sensing effect function and cast this optimization problem to address crowdsensing task assignment in cognitive radio networks. This problem is difficult to be solved because the complexity of this problem increases exponentially with the growth in mobile terminals. To assign crowdsensing task, we propose four distributed algorithms with different transition probabilities and use a Markov chain to analyze the approximation gap of our proposed schemes. Simulation results evaluate the average performance of our proposed algorithms and validate the algorithm’s convergence...|$|R
