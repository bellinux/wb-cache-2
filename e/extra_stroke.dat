500|$|A {{controversial}} {{ending to}} the Masters occurred in 1968. Roberto De Vicenzo signed a scorecard (scored by playing partner Tommy Aaron) which incorrectly showed him as making a par 4 {{instead of a}} birdie 3 on the 17th hole of the final round. By the rules of golf, if a player signs a scorecard (thereby attesting to its veracity) that records a score on a hole higher than what he actually made on the hole, the player receives the higher score for that hole. This <b>extra</b> <b>stroke</b> cost De Vicenzo {{a chance to be}} in an 18-hole Monday playoff with Bob Goalby, who won the green jacket. De Vicenzo's mistake led to the famous quote, [...] "What a stupid I am." ...|$|E
500|$|The final {{took place}} on August 16, at 10:10 CST. Before the race, Milorad Čavić made {{headlines}} by saying {{in an interview that}} it would be better for swimming if he beat Phelps. Phelps' coach Bob Bowman used the quote to provide motivation to his protégé. In an interview, Phelps said that doubters like Čavić [...] "fires me up more than anything, I always welcome comments. It definitely motivates me even more." [...] Almost immediately after the race started, Čavić took the lead with Phelps getting off to a slow start. At the turn, Čavić was first, followed by Ian Crocker, while Phelps made the split in seventh place, just 0.62 seconds behind Čavić. As the two approached the finish, Čavić tried to coast to the wall on one last stroke, while Phelps, who had misjudged the end, took an extra half-stroke, causing both competitors to touch the wall at almost exactly the same time. It turned out that Phelps had actually finished one one-hundredth of a second ahead of Čavić, with a time of 50.58 seconds. Phelps even admitted that, at first, he thought the <b>extra</b> <b>stroke</b> he took had cost him the gold medal, until he looked at the scoreboard displaying the results. Andrew Lauterstein won the bronze medal, also beating Crocker by one one-hundredth of a second.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for generating stylized artistic rendering of caricatures from a given face image, {{with the ability to}} map any one of the main six expressions and control the degree of its expressiveness on the generated caricature. Our method achieves this by manipulating the facial appearance and expressivity of the caricature, using quadratic deformation model representations of facial expressions. A stroke-based nonphotorealistic rendering (NPR) engine is developed to generate the output caricature that appears to be a sketch of the original image. The NPR engine segments the defined rendering path and generates rectangular strokes that approximate each segment. The stroke properties are computed by applying geometric image moments on each segment. To enhance the overall appearance of the caricature, <b>extra</b> <b>strokes</b> are randomly positioned around the rendering path. The results show that from an input neutral facial image, expressive rendered caricatures are generated for the facial expressions neutral, smile, sad, fear, surprise, disgust, and anger. Our approach produces very expressive artistically rendered caricatures, and could lead to future research directions in further extending the method to produce pencil sketch rendering of images or rendering 3 D characters to generate cartoon-like 3 D characters...|$|R

40|$|Large {{randomised}} {{trials have}} demonstrated that fibrinolytic therapy can reduce mortality in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The indications for, and contraindications to, this treatment in some categories of patient are disputed, examples being late presentation, elderly patients, and those in cardiogenic shock. This overview aims to help resolve some of the remaining uncertainties. From all trials of fibrinolytic therapy versus control that randomised more than 1000 patients with suspected AMI, information was sought and checked on deaths during the first 5 weeks and on major adverse events occurring during hospitalisation. The nine trials included 58, 600 patients, among whom 6177 (10. 5 %) deaths, 564 (1. 0 %) strokes, and 436 (0. 7 %) major non-cerebral bleeds were reported. Fibrinolytic therapy was associated with an excess of deaths during days 0 - 1 (especially among patients presenting more than 12 h after symptom onset, and in the elderly) but this was outweighed by a much larger benefit during days 2 - 35. This "early hazard" should not obscure the very clear overall survival advantage that is produced by fibrinolytic therapy. Benefit was observed among patients presenting with ST elevation or bundle-branch block (BBB) [...] irrespective of age, sex, blood pressure, heart rate, or previous history of myocardial infarction or diabetes [...] and was greater the earlier treatment began. Among the 45, 000 patients presenting with ST elevation or BBB the relation between benefit and delay from symptom onset indicated highly significant absolute mortality reductions of about 30 per 1000 for those presenting within 0 - 6 h and of about 20 per 1000 for those presenting 7 - 12 h from onset, and a statistically uncertain benefit of about 10 per 1000 for those presenting at 13 - 18 h (with more randomised evidence needed in this latter group to assess reliably the net effects of treatment). Fibrinolytic therapy was associated with about 4 <b>extra</b> <b>strokes</b> per 1000 during days 0 - 1 : of these, 2 were associated with early death and so were already accounted for in the overall mortality reduction, 1 was moderately or severely disabling, and 1 was not. This overview indicates that fibrinolytic therapy is beneficial in a much wider range of patients than is currently given such treatment routinely...|$|R
50|$|With the {{declaration}} of the new royal house, concerns were voiced {{on how to handle}} the remaining descendants of the deposed Wang family. King Taejo and his officials felt that if the legitimacy of their rule were ever questioned by the remaining members of the Goryeo Dynasty, they might have to suppress a mass rebellion or even risk losing the recently gained throne. In the end, Taejo had his prime minister, Jeong Do-jeon, summon the Wang family to the coast of the Yellow Sea and instruct them to board a ship bound for Ganghwa Island, where they were told they would live quietly out of the government's sight. However, the entire ploy was a trap. A crew member on board was instructed beforehand to smash a hole in the hull as soon as the ship had entered sufficiently deep waters. The ship sank, and the last members of the Goryeo Dynasty drowned. According to an urban legend, after the fate of the Wangs gullible enough to board the doomed ship reached their relatives on the mainland, most of them changed their surnames from Wang (王) to Ok (玉) by adding an <b>extra</b> brush <b>stroke,</b> thus hiding their true descent.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a graph grammar approach for {{the recognition of}} handwritten mathematical expressions. Pen based interfaces provide a natural human computer interaction; interfaces for entering mathematical expressions are no exception to that. The problem is challenging, as it includes the sub-problems of character recognition (OCR) and 2 -dimensional structure understanding. Thus, {{on top of the}} problems of the standard OCR systems, such as high variation in character shapes, the two dimensional nature of a mathematical expression brings further ambiguity. We use graph grammars for structural understanding of the expressions in order to represent as much information as possible in the parse process. Representing input expression as a graph protects the geometrical relations among the symbols of the input, while alternatives include methods for linearization of the input which may introduce critical errors into the parse process. Also graph grammars have the advantage of flexibility over procedurally coded parse systems. Another important aspect of our system is the fact that all alternative parses are evaluated and the one with maximum likelihood is selected as the intended expression. The likelihoods are estimated according to OCR confidence scores and structural relationships statistics. The segmentation step precedes the parse process, and segments and groups strokes collected from the Tablet input, according to timestamps and distance in space respectively. Then, the segmented symbols are recognized by the OCR engine which uses offline (image) features to allow for flexibility in time dimension, such as adding <b>extra</b> <b>strokes</b> and symbols anytime during the equation. The extracted features are used in an ANN and SVM combination engine returning top- 3 character alternatives and confidence values. The parse process expands the graph by generating new tokens with repeated application of grammar rules. At the end, one or more tokens contain the full expression, along with a confidence value based on the 2 -dimensional layout of the symbols in the expression and the associated statistics of geometrical relations between symbols. These and the OCR confidence scores are used in disambiguating alternative parses. Our approach is more powerful compared to graph re-writing systems in that all alternative parses are evaluated, rather than selecting the most likely rule application at a particular step, in an irreversible fashion. This also eliminates the need for specifying rule precedences, making system development or use of alternate grammars easier. The only limitation of our system is that segmentation errors are irreversible. That is, the parse process does not handle alternate segmentations, {{in order to keep the}} complexity of the parse process down. We alleviate this problem by providing feedback to the user as the segmentation proceeds, in real time. Our user interface gives error correction tools to the user to correct OCR errors and it can generate LATEX code, and MathML codes and graphical rendering of the input handwritten mathematical expression. An extensive collection of mathematical expression and isolated symbols are collected from 15 users for 57 different expressions from a 70 -character alphabet. There are, in total, 1710 mathematical expressions and 10500 isolated characters. All samples are in the natural writing styles of the users...|$|R
40|$|Segmentation­by­recognition is a {{successful}} approach for recognizing cursively handwritten words. Its main strength is that the interdependence of strokes forming a letter is correctly taken into account {{by the use of}} a character recognizer, that evaluates an aggregate of strokes (character hypothesis) as a whole. However, a straightforward implementation of such an approach would fail {{to take into account the}} dependencies of each character hypothesis with the adjacent hypotheses and with global characteristics of the image, like the position of upperline and baseline, the average dimensions of strokes, etc. This paper describes a cursive handwritten word recognition system in which recognition performance is enhanced by the use of several complementary sources of information, like the relationships of the strokes that make up a hypothesis among themselves and with the preceding strokes, the position of the hypothesis with respect to baseline and upperline, the statistics of the number of strokes making up letters belonging to different classes, the dispersion of character data around the different code vectors used to measure distances, the plausibility for a hypothesis of being a spurious <b>stroke</b> (<b>extra</b> ink).
