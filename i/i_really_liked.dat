Eleven Land of Gorch sketches, aired between October 1975 and January 1976 , with four additional appearances in March, April, May, and September [...] Henson recalled that [...] "I saw what [...] was going for and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> it and {{wanted to be a part}} of it, but somehow, what we were trying to do and what his writers could write for it never gelled." [...] The SNL writers never got comfortable writing for the characters, and frequently disparaged Henson's creations; one, Michael O'Donoghue, quipped, [...] "I won't write for felt." ...|$|E

He and Carl Perkins became friends. Perkins said that [...] "I knew when I first heard Chuck that he'd been {{affected}} by country music. I respected his writing; his records were very, very great." [...] As they toured, Perkins discovered that Berry not only liked country music but also knew about as many songs as he did. Jimmie Rodgers was one of his favorites. [...] "Chuck knew every Blue Yodel and most of Bill Monroe's songs as well", Perkins remembered. [...] "He told me about how he was raised very poor, very tough. He had a hard life. He was a good guy. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> him." ...|$|E
500|$|Labyrinth {{was being}} seriously {{discussed}} {{as early as}} March 1983, when Henson held a meeting with Froud and children's author Dennis Lee. Lee was tasked with writing a novella on which a script could be based, submitting {{it at the end}} of 1983. Henson approached Terry Jones to write the film's script as [...] "his daughter Lisa had just read Erik the Viking and suggested that he try me as screen-writer." [...] Jones was given Dennis Lee's novella to use as a basis for his script, but later told Empire that Lee had produced an unfinished [...] "poetic novella" [...] that he [...] "didn't really get on with." [...] In light of this, Jones [...] "discarded it and sat down with Brian 's drawings and sifted through them and found the ones that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked,</b> and started creating the story from them." ...|$|E

500|$|When SpongeBob SquarePants premiered, Plankton was {{not part}} of the series' main cast. Plankton's voice actor, Mr. Lawrence, has stated that after {{producing}} Plankton's debut episode in the late 1990s, creator Stephen Hillenburg was unsure if he would continue to use the character. After recording it, Hillenburg was noncommittal, telling Lawrence: [...] "We'll probably do another [...] next year," [...] Lawrence summarized Plankton's origins in 2015, saying that he [...] "was only supposed to be in one or two episodes, but I was a writer on the show and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> this character". Following his first voice recording as Plankton, Lawrence drafted some of his own ideas for the character and passed them to Hillenburg. From then on, Plankton began to appear more often. Lawrence considers the third season the first in which Plankton is a main character.|$|E
500|$|Feminist author Naomi Wolf {{criticized the}} video as {{propaganda}} for the Marine Corps, stating [...] "I {{really want to}} find out if she was paid by them for making it ..... it is truly shameful. I would suggest a boycott of this singer whom <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> if you are as offended at this glorification of violence as I am." [...] Glenn Selig, founder of The Publicity Agency, responded to these claims on Fox News Live, stating, [...] "In her efforts to boycott the video, Naomi Wolf has brought more attention to it, without her comments, most people would clearly have seen the military simply as a metaphor and not as an attempt by Katy Perry to glamorize the military or war." [...] Perry told MTV that she chose the military plot because it represented the song, saying, [...] "It's an affirmation of strength, so I wanted to go the strongest route I ever could." ...|$|E
500|$|After the 13-month tour {{in support}} of The Smashing Pumpkins' second album Siamese Dream (1993), Billy Corgan {{immediately}} began writing songs for the band's next record. From the outset, the band intended the new record to be a double album, partly inspired by The Beatles' eponymous album. Corgan said, [...] "We almost had enough material to make Siamese Dream a double album. With this new album, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> {{the notion that we}} would create a wider scope in which to put other kinds of material we were writing." [...] Corgan felt that the band's musical approach was running its course, and wanted the band to approach the album as if it were its last. Corgan described the album at the time to the music press as [...] "The Wall for Generation X", a comparison with Pink Floyd's 1979 album, one of the highest selling and best known concept albums of all time.|$|E

This one, I just stumbled upon and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> the content. It inspired me to take a different approach lyrically. You have to keep things interesting for yourself when writing new material so I just took this and ran with it. [...] Those types of lyrics are fun to write, you know? The dark subject matter, the dark master stuff. It's another way of writing, a fresh one to me." [...] He also summarizes the lyrics: [...] "It's a story about somebody who loses himself and end struggles with the darkness, symbolized by the Dark Master. And the story ends up really being the darkness within and goes through the different phases where he has to fight demons and things like that.|$|E
500|$|Stephen {{was written}} by Kesha Sebert, in {{collaboration}} with her mother Pebe Sebert, David Gamson, and Oliver Leiber. The song was produced by Gamson with additional production by Leiber. Gamson played all the instruments on the song, {{with the exception of}} the accordion which was performed by Kesha. The song's recording was commenced at ACME Recording, Long Island, California, and at Ollywood Studios, Hollywood, California, by Gamson. Kesha told Rolling Stone that Stephen was one of her favorite tracks on the album. She explained that the song stemmed from her experiences with a man that she had been [...] "stalking since [...] was 15." [...] It was written when the singer was sixteen, in collaboration with her mother. She found David Gamson to produce the song. [...] "He does all the keyboard stuff, he's amazing, a crazy cynical genius guy, and he liked my voice and my thing, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> his thing, so we decided to work together" [...] she explained.|$|E
500|$|The role of Linda was {{the first}} to be cast. Noé found Paz de la Huerta after holding auditions in New York City. [...] "I met Paz and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> her. She had the profile for the {{character}} because she likes screaming, crying, showing herself naked—all the qualities for it." [...] Due to a desire that Linda and Oscar should be believable as siblings, Nathaniel Brown, a non-professional, was cast because of his resemblance to Huerta. Noé feared that a professional actor would be frustrated by being shown almost exclusively from behind, but he felt that Brown, an aspiring director, would find it stimulating to merely be present on the set. Auditions were held for westerners living in Japan for other Tokyo-based roles. Cyril Roy went to an audition with a friend only because he wanted to talk with the director, whose previous films he admired. Roy was cast as Alex, since Noé found his talkative personality suitable for the role. Noé said about Brown and Roy: ...|$|E

Welling talked about why {{he was interested in}} the project in an interview with Paul Fischer: [...] "The top three reasons I decided to do this film were, one, Steve Martin, two, Steve Martin and three, Steve Martin. That was the number one draw for me. Then, after reading the script, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> this character, Charlie. I liked what he went through, what he had to go through, and I felt I understood where he was coming from. And I just {{wanted to be a part}} of it."

500|$|Now titled simply [...] "Good Shepherd", a {{recording}} of the song became Kaukonen's major showcase number on the Airplane's November 1969 Volunteers album, where it avoided the political topicality of the most visible tracks {{on the rest of}} the album. [...] "Good Shepherd" [...] encompassed elements of both gospel and blues in its playing and showed that folk roots were still quite present in the Airplane's mixture of sounds and influences that led to psychedelic rock. [...] Indeed, folk music underlay many aspects of the San Francisco psychedelic sound, with the Airplane as a prime example. [...] The recording of [...] "Good Shepherd", which took place from late March to late June 1969, featured a rare Kaukonen lead vocal backed by mellow harmonies from the group. [...] Its arrangement incorporated Kaukonen's sharp, stinging electric guitar lines set against an acoustic guitar opening, with singer Grace Slick wordlessly doubling Kaukonen's guitar line during the instrumental break. [...] The track was considered a beautiful standout on the album. [...] Kaukonen himself later referred to it as [...] "a great spiritual that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked.</b> It's a psychedelic folk-rock song." ...|$|E
500|$|Phillip Atwell {{directed}} the music video on December 10–11, 2002. Almost all the film footage {{was used in}} the video except for a scene where 50 Cent raps in a glass box. The video is set in a fictional hip hop boot camp known as the Shady/Aftermath Artist Development Center. It begins with a black Hummer driving to the facility at an unknown location. Video clips from Eminem's single [...] "Without Me" [...] are seen playing in the entrance on flat screen TVs. We see Eminem & Dr. Dre looking down at the lab from a lab balcony with windows. 50 Cent is introduced by hanging upside down from the roof of a gym. Atwell commented, [...] "I think I could have done better with it, but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> the way that it turned out". The video also contains a shooting range, which Atwell felt was appropriate because 50 Cent had been shot nine times. He said, [...] "creatively, I felt like we were able to put guns in a video and have it play. And I like it when you are able to play within the standards and still give the artist something symbolic of what they are going for." ...|$|E

500|$|Usher and Minaj {{shot the}} music video on March 9, 2010 in Los Angeles with {{director}} Taj Stansberry, represented by Leah Harmony and Ciarra Pardo. In {{an interview with}} Vibe, Stansberry commented on the video's sex appeal and the pairing of Usher and Minaj, stating, [...] "This probably {{has the potential to}} be [...] Usher’s one of the best entertainers in the world, then you have Nicki Minaj who’s fresh on the scene. Put them together and there’s just sparks, it was real good." [...] When asked about the music video's concept would redefine the word [...] "freak", commenting: [...] "My general idea was to take the word and show its many faceted sides, twisting and turning it to where there’s really no distinguishing between one freak and another. Usher went there. When you’re engaging in sexual activity, there are many transitions and this is not about what they look like literally, but what they look like metaphorically. It’s about luring people into a situation. Because you have your thoughts on a ménage à trois, but then we’re doing it in a non-obvious way." [...] On Minaj and her pairing with Usher, Stansberry said, [...] " [...] had a few looks that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked.</b> She played the part, but still was her. If you really listen to her words in the song, you can kinda visualize her outfit." [...] Stansberry also confirmed that R singer Ciara and singer-actor Jamie Foxx would make appearances in the video. In an interview with MTV News on the set of her video for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said that [...] "The video is freaky. And it's a great concept, a great story line," [...] Minaj told MTV News. [...] "It felt just like one of the sequels to Saw. It was dope." [...] Stating that the video had a [...] "secret society" [...] concept, Usher told Access Hollywood that the place symbolized locations where people use to get away from pressures, and also said the movie Eyes Wide Shut was some sort of inspiration of the video. On March 22, 2010 a thirty second preview of the music video was surfaced onto the internet. Two days later on March 24, 2010, Usher premiered the full music video on BET's 106 & Park.|$|E
500|$|In an NPR {{interview}} via affiliate WBUR-FM, Mumbai Mirror columnist Aseem Chhabra called Chak De! India [...] "an {{example of}} a film that's been made {{within the framework of}} Bollywood and yet it is a very different film. It does take up some realistic issues, and what <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> about the film was that the women who acted, you know, who are part of the team, each one of them got a chance. Their personality, their characters, were very well-written, and so, the superstar in the film was Shahrukh Khan, who was the coach of the team; he doesn't sort of take over the whole film. Every supporting character gets a role, and it's a very inspiring movie that really changed the mood in India. People loved it". Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave the film four out of five stars stating that it was a film of [...] "great performances by a bunch of unknowns." [...] India Today called Chak De! India [...] "the most feisty girl power movie to have come out of Bollywood ever." [...] Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu wrote, [...] "At another level, Chak De is about women's liberation. It {{is one of the best}} feminist films of our times." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "Chak De's ... a winner all the way." [...] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express called the film [...] "the most authentic, meticulously researched sports movie India has made". [...] In Kolkata's Telegraph, Bharathi S. Pradhan wrote that the film combines [...] "an extremely well-knit screenplay with unrelentingly deft direction, 16 unknown, and not even glamorous, girls simply carried you with them, with one single known actor compelling you to watch Chak De India without blinking". Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC gave Chak De! India four out of five stars stating that [...] "while the tale of the sporting underdog is hardly new, Jaideep Sahni's screenplay offers a rare look at a popular Indian sport often overshadowed by cricket." [...] Andy Webster of The New York Times wrote that the film gave a fresh look to the conventional underdog sports film, comparing its premise to the U.S. victory in the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup. Derek Elley of Variety called Chak De! India [...] "a patriotic heartwarmer that scores some old-fashioned entertainment goals." [...] In The Hollywood Reporter, Kirk Honeycutt wrote that the [...] "technical credits are first rate with excellent cinematography, quicksilver editing, musical montages of practice and a fine use of locations." ...|$|E
