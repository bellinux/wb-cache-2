5|$|A {{number of}} college members have rowed for the {{university}} against Cambridge University <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boat</b> Race and the Women's Boat Race. Barney Williams, a Canadian rower who studied at the college, won a silver medal in rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boat</b> Race in 2005 and 2006. Other students who rowed while at the college have achieved success in other fields, including John Sankey, who became Lord Chancellor, Alwyn Williams, who became Bishop of Durham, and Maurice Jones, who became Principal of St David's College, Lampeter. Another college rower, James Page, was appointed Secretary of the Amateur Rowing Association and coached both the Oxford and Cambridge University boat clubs.|$|E
5|$|A sea shore. As Goffredo, Eustazio and Rinaldo {{near the}} magician's lair, a {{beautiful}} woman calls from her boat, promising Rinaldo that she can take him to Almirena. Two mermaids sing of love's delights, and urge Rinaldo to go <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> He hesitates, unsure what to do, and his companions attempt to restrain him. Angry at the abduction of his loved one, Rinaldo enters the boat, which immediately sails off. Goffredo and Eustazio are shocked at Rinaldo's impulsiveness and believe that he has deserted their cause.|$|E
5|$|U-28 sank by {{accident}} on 17 March 1944, at the U-boat pier in Neustadt. During a training exercise, the boat had passed under a dummy freighter used for target practice. The commander-in-training failed {{to note the}} position of the stationary freighter, and the U-boat's conning tower was ripped off. Water flooded the control room, but the other compartments remained intact. The crew escaped by slowly equalizing the water pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and swimming to the surface. The boat was raised in March 1944, but was stricken on 4 August. The submarine's crew suffered no casualties during her career.|$|E

5|$|A hunchback {{fisherman}} finds a {{young girl}} tied to a mast, the sole survivor of a shipwreck, and raises her into womanhood {{with the intention of}} making her his wife. Ten years pass and the woman, out of gratitude, promises to marry him. The hunchback hires a handsome stranger, the boy. The boy and the girl fall in love, but the girl refuses to marry him. The hunchback sees the two embrace and threatens the boy with a knife. The next day, the three go fishing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and an argument breaks out. During the argument the boat tips over and the girl is washed away. The hunchback and the boy search for her, until the boy becomes exhausted and collapses on the shore. The hunchback finds the girl on a rock and brings her ashore. As the two reunite, he sees how happy they are together and takes his leave.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} lacuna, Hymir is sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> unhappy and totally silent, as they row back to shore. On shore, Hymir {{suggests}} that Thor should help him carry a whale {{back to his}} farm. Thor picks both the boat and the whales up, and carries it all back to Hymir's farm. After Thor successfully smashes a crystal goblet by throwing it at Hymir's head on Týr's mother's suggestion, Thor and Týr are given the cauldron. Týr cannot lift it, but Thor manages to roll it, and so with it they leave. Some distance from Hymir's home, an army of many-headed beings led by Hymir attacks the two, but are killed by the hammer of Thor. Although one of his goats is lame in the leg, the two manage to bring the cauldron back, have plenty of ale, and so, from then on, return to Ægir's for more every winter.|$|E
5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, {{it has been said that}} Young was too far away to identify the person <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E

5|$|The McClintock {{expedition}} {{also found}} a human skeleton on the southern coast of King William Island. Still clothed, it was searched, and some papers were found, including a seaman's certificate for Chief Petty Officer Henry Peglar (b. 1808), Captain of the Foretop, HMS Terror. However, since the uniform {{was that of a}} ship's steward, {{it is more likely that}} the body was that of Thomas Armitage, gun-room steward on Terror and a shipmate of Peglar, whose papers he carried. At another site on the western extreme of the island, Hobson discovered a lifeboat containing two skeletons and relics from the Franklin expedition. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was a large amount of abandoned equipment, including boots, silk handkerchiefs, scented soap, sponges, slippers, hair combs, and many books, among them a copy of The Vicar of Wakefield. McClintock also took testimony from the Inuit about the expedition's disastrous end.|$|E
5|$|Titanics {{survivors}} {{were rescued}} around 04:00 on 15April by the RMS Carpathia, which had steamed {{through the night}} at high speed and at considerable risk, as the ship had to dodge numerous icebergs en route. Carpathias lights were first spotted around 03:30, which greatly cheered the survivors, though it took several more hours for everyone to be brought aboard. The 30 or more men on collapsible B finally managed to board two other lifeboats, but one survivor died just before the transfer was made. Collapsible A was also in trouble and was now nearly awash; many of those aboard (maybe more than a half) had died overnight. The remaining survivors– {{an unknown number of}} men, estimated to be between 10–11 and more than 20, and one woman– were transferred from A into another lifeboat, leaving behind three bodies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> which was left to drift away. It was recovered a month later by the White Star liner Oceanic, with the bodies still aboard.|$|E
5|$|Some {{prominent}} individuals rowed {{while they}} were students at the college. The historian Albert Pollard was Captain of Boats in 1890, having rowed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> that was last on the river in 1889. Alwyn Williams (later Bishop of Durham), who was a student from 1906 to 1911, was captain of the Boat Club, as was James Page ("Freddie"), {{who went on to}} become secretary of the Amateur Rowing Association from 1952 to 1972 and a rowing coach for both Oxford and Cambridge Boat Clubs. Maurice Jones (later Principal of St David's College, Lampeter) was a cox, as were Gordon Roe (later Bishop of Huntingdon) and the chemist Frank Greenaway. John Sankey (later Lord Chancellor) rowed in a Torpid boat that went down four places, whilst the boat in which the baritone David Ffrangcon Davies rowed went up five places in Torpids and four in Eights Week. Angus Buchanan, who won the Victoria Cross in 1916 during the First World War, rowed in a college four in 1919, despite having been blinded in 1917. Anton Muttukumaru (later Commander of the Ceylon Army) rowed at bow in a college four.|$|E

25|$|Both of his biographers give a {{much more}} {{detailed}} account of the occurrence, evidently taken from a common source. The Frenchmen first sent over in a boat their banners, their arquebuses and pistols, swords and targets, and some helmets and breast-pieces. Then twenty Spaniards crossed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and brought the now unarmed Frenchmen over the lagoon in parties of ten. They were subjected to no ill-treatment as they were ferried over, the Spaniards not wishing to arouse any suspicions among {{those who had not}} yet crossed. Menéndez himself withdrew some distance from the shore to the rear of a sand dune, where he was concealed from the view of the prisoners who were crossing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b>|$|E
