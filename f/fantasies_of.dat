5|$|Docter {{began working}} on the story in 2004, {{which was based on}} <b>fantasies</b> <b>of</b> {{escaping}} from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela gathering research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth. The floating house is attached by a varying number between 10,000 and 20,000 balloons in the film's sequences. Up was Pixar's first film to be presented in Disney Digital 3-D.|$|E
5|$|Heavy Traffic is a 1973 American adult {{animated}} comedy-drama film {{written and}} directed by Ralph Bakshi. The film, which begins, ends, and occasionally combines with live-action, explores the often surreal <b>fantasies</b> <b>of</b> a young New York cartoonist named Michael Corleone, using pinball imagery as a metaphor for inner-city life. Heavy Traffic was Bakshi and producer Steve Krantz's follow-up to the film Fritz the Cat. Though producer Krantz made varied attempts to produce an R-rated film, Heavy Traffic was given an X rating by the MPAA. The film received positive reviews and is widely considered to be Bakshi's biggest critical success.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} the video was meant to {{illustrate}} the lyrics of the song. It depicts the sexual <b>fantasies</b> <b>of</b> a rich and bored housewife played by Beyoncé who tries to seduce her man while having breakfast at her house wearing a white robe. The video opens with various shots of a big mansion in which the singer is seen {{in one of the}} rooms. She tries to get her man's attention while he reads a newspaper. As he does not notice her, she throws a napkin on the floor and her female servant comes to lift it. The clip transitions to scenes of Beyoncé dressed in a Victorian jeweled outfit with a mask in her hands, lip-syncing the lyrics and dancing to the rhythm of the song. Afterwards, she is seen entering a limousine in which Jay-Z is already inside. Scenes of Beyoncé with a black coat and lingerie walking in front of the car are also intertwined throughout.|$|E

25|$|<b>Fantasies</b> <b>of</b> group sex are {{extremely}} common among {{both men and}} women.

25|$|An earlier survey, {{conducted}} from 1997 to 1998, reported about 2% of furry respondents stating {{an interest}} in zoophilia, and less than 1% {{an interest in}} plushophilia (sexually aroused by stuffed animal toys). The older, lower results, which are even lower than estimated in the general population, were due to the methodology of questioning respondents face-to-face, which led to social desirability bias. In contrast, one study showed 7.5% of college students reporting zoophilia, while other studies find only 2.2% to 5.3% expressing <b>fantasies</b> <b>of</b> sex with animals.|$|E
