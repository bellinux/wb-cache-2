5|$|In {{his last}} years Evans {{compiled}} a list, since lost, {{of all his}} inventions—eighty in total, as alluded to <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> his last publication to his lawyers. Some of his unfinished ideas that are known include a scheme for the gas lighting of cities in the United States, a means for raising sunken ships, a machine gun, a self-oiling shaft bearing, various types of gearshift for steam carriages, a dough-kneading machine and a perpetual baking oven. In one proposal in 1814, as the British Navy threatened Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812, Evans ventured to build a steam-powered frigate, but the scheme didn't get far.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1980s FGM {{was widely}} known in English as female circumcision, {{implying}} an equivalence in severity with male circumcision. From 1929 the Kenya Missionary Council {{referred to it}} as the sexual mutilation of women, following the lead of Marion Scott Stevenson, a Church of Scotland missionary. References to the practice as mutilation increased throughout the 1970s. In 1975 Rose Oldfield Hayes, an American anthropologist, used the term female genital mutilation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> a paper in American Ethnologist, and four years later Fran Hosken, an Austrian-American feminist writer, called it mutilation in her influential The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{were raised}} by Antonio Saldías (pen name Don Antonio de Petrel) {{regarding}} {{the appropriateness of the}} date used to celebrate the anniversary of Pichilemu, which commemorated the creation of the commune, on 21 December 1891, a date also used in the coat of arms. Saldías pointed out that, since there was no act of foundation of Pichilemu nor record of date of the first inhabitation of the area by the Promaucaes, the date of 24 January 1544, specified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> encomienda of Topocalma given by Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia to Juan Gómez de Almagro, another conquistador, was the most correct date to be used to commemorate the anniversary of Pichilemu. The current territory of Pichilemu was part of the encomienda of Topocalma.|$|E

5|$|Ecology and {{evolutionary}} biology are considered sister disciplines {{of the life}} sciences. Natural selection, life history, development, adaptation, populations, and inheritance are examples of concepts that thread equally into ecological {{and evolutionary}} theory. Morphological, behavioural, and genetic traits, for example, can be mapped onto evolutionary trees to study {{the historical development of}} a species in relation to their functions and roles in different ecological circumstances. In this framework, the analytical tools of ecologists and evolutionists overlap as they organize, classify, and investigate life through common systematic principals, such as phylogenetics or the Linnaean system of taxonomy. The two disciplines often appear together, such as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution. There is no sharp boundary separating ecology from evolution, and they differ more in their areas of applied focus. Both disciplines discover and explain emergent and unique properties and processes operating across different spatial or temporal scales of organization. While the boundary between ecology and evolution is not always clear, ecologists study the abiotic and biotic factors that influence evolutionary processes, and evolution can be rapid, occurring on ecological timescales as short as one generation.|$|E
5|$|The stage show {{featured}} Wurst in a cream-covered mermaid-like dress {{standing on}} a pedestal {{in the middle of}} the stage. The stage appeared dark at the beginning of the song with minimal lighting, before the lighting rose towards the beginning of the first chorus. At the start of the song, the camera appeared at the back of the arena before swooping into centre stage to a close-up of Wurst, followed by it flying off again at the beginning of the chorus. The background LED screens featured at the first chorus flaming rain, followed by flames in the shape of wings, in reference to the phoenix <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> the song. Pyrotechnic flames also featured at the finale of the song. Wind machines were also used to effect during the performance.|$|E

25|$|In popular usage, {{the term}} UFO {{came to be}} used to refer to claims of alien spacecraft. and because of the public and media ridicule {{associated}} with the topic, some investigators prefer to use such terms as unidentified aerial phenomenon (or UAP) or anomalous phenomena, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena (NARCAP).|$|E

25|$|In popular parlance {{and also}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> this article the term {{sparkling}} {{is used for}} all wines that produce bubbles at the surface after opening.

25|$|The name of {{the country}} in {{official}} usage was also changed to the ‘Realm of New Zealand’. ‘Dominion’ largely fell into disuse over the next decade.

25|$|James Byron Dean (February 8, 1931– September 30, 1955) was an American actor.
