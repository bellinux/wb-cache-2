6000|$|We broke bread, for {{the first}} time in Europe, that evening, having made an early and a hurried dinner on board the ship. The Isle of Wight is celebrated for its butter, and yet we found it {{difficult}} to eat it! The English, and many other European nations, put no salt in their table butter; and we, who had been accustomed to the American usage, exclaimed with one voice against its insipidity. A near relation of A----'s who once served in the British army, used to relate an anecdote on the subject of tastes, that is quite <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> <b>A</b> brother officer, who had gone safely through the celebrated siege of Gibraltar, landed at Portsmouth, on his return home. Among the other privations of his recent service, he had been compelled to eat butter whose fragrance scented the whole Rock. Before retiring for the night, he gave particular orders to have hot rolls and Isle of Wight butter served for breakfast. The first mouthful disappointed him, and of course the unlucky waiter suffered. The latter protested that he had executed the order to the letter. [...] "Then take away your Isle of Wight butter," [...] growled the officer, [...] "and bring me some that has a taste." ...|$|E
6000|$|All the {{foregoing}} is {{by way of}} preamble to the statement that the horrors of Molokai, {{as they have been}} painted in the past, do not exist. The Settlement has been written up repeatedly by sensationalists, and usually by sensationalists who have never laid eyes on it. Of course, leprosy is leprosy, and it is a terrible thing; but so much that is lurid has been written about Molokai that neither the lepers, nor those who devote their lives to them, have received a fair deal. Here is a case <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> <b>A</b> newspaper writer, who, of course, had never been near the Settlement, vividly described Superintendent McVeigh, crouching in a grass hut and being besieged nightly by starving lepers on their knees, wailing for food. This hair-raising account was copied by the press all over the United States and was the cause of many indignant and protesting editorials. Well, I lived and slept for five days in Mr. McVeigh's [...] "grass hut" [...] (which was a comfortable wooden cottage, by the way; and there isn't a grass house in the whole Settlement), and I heard the lepers wailing for food--only the wailing was peculiarly harmonious and rhythmic, and it was accompanied by the music of stringed instruments, violins, guitars, ukuleles, and banjos. Also, the wailing was of various sorts. The leper brass band wailed, and two singing societies wailed, and lastly a quintet of excellent voices wailed. So much for a lie that should never have been printed. The wailing was the serenade which the glee clubs always give Mr. McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.|$|E

[...] Things {{may or may not}} turn out as anticipated, but that is merely another of the million chances of the sea. Take a case <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> <b>A</b> flotilla of our destroyers sighted six (there had been eight the previous afternoon) German battleships of Kingly and Imperial caste very early in the morning of the 1st June, and duly attacked. At first our people ran parallel to the enemy, then, as far as one can make out, headed them and swept round sharp to the left, firing torpedoes from their port or left-hand tubes. Between them they hit a battleship, which went up in flame and débris. But one of the flotilla had not turned with the rest. She had anticipated that the attack would be made on another quarter, and, for certain technical reasons, she was not ready. When she was, she turned, and single-handed--the rest of the flotilla having finished and gone on--carried out two attacks on the five remaining battleships. She got one of them amidships, causing a terrific explosion and flame above the masthead, which signifies that the magazine has been touched off. She counted the battleships when the smoke had cleared, and there were but four of them. She herself was not hit, though shots fell close. She went her way, and, seeing nothing of her sisters, picked up another flotilla and stayed with it till the end. Do I make clear the maze of blind hazard and wary judgment in which our men of the sea must move? ...|$|E

5000|$|Critics {{of these}} {{programs}} also do not fully appreciate the increasing reliance {{of the private sector}} in today’s business environment on economic development incentives for business expansion or retention. [...] Incentive packages can constitute a meaningful contribution toward project investment. Consequently, business enterprises with incentive experience, frequently will include incentives as part of project site selection checklists and will treat them as relevant budget line items. [...] As a case <b>in</b> <b>point,</b> <b>a</b> recipient relies on incentives to offset higher development or operation costs (i.e., site or labor costs) in its selection of a location for a new project. The emergence of public-private partnerships reflects the importance that the private enterprises place on the availability of economic development incentives under these initiatives.|$|E
5000|$|From Expo '88 in Brisbane onwards, {{countries}} {{started to}} use world expositions more widely and more strongly {{as a platform}} to improve their national images through their pavilions.

In a world where a strong national image is a key asset, pavilions became advertising campaigns, and the Expo a vehicle for 'nation branding'. Apart from cultural and symbolic reasons, organizing countries (and the cities and regions hosting them) also utilize the world exposition to brand themselves. According to branding expert Wally Olins, Spain used Expo '92 and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona {{in the same year}} to underline its new position as a modern and democratic country and present itself as a prominent member of the European Union and the global community.|$|E
50|$|The {{system of}} the Wardens of the Marches came into {{existence}} {{as a result of}} this First War of Scottish Independence (1296-1328) with areas on either side of the border being entrusted to 'wardens' who did what had previously been done by sheriffs in terms of military functions. These were experienced military men drawn from the powerful local families (Dacres, Cliffords, Greystokes, Percies and Nevilles in Cumbria). They ran their own private armies, paid for by themselves at first, later paid for by the Crown, sometimes being offered plunder in return for their support. (Some failed to prosper in the role: the career of Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle, who had defended Carlisle in 1315 and became Warden of the West March, was a case <b>in</b> <b>point).</b> <b>A</b> type of customary law grew up (March law) whereby disputes and criminal cases were dealt with by the wardens, rather than by Royal justice as elsewhere in the country.

5000|$|Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are a {{significant}} tool to allow private citizens to get around network sovereignty and any restrictions their government may place on their access to the internet. VPNs allow a computer to route its internet connection from one location to another. For example one would connect from a connection at point A to a connection at point B, and to others {{it would appear that}} they are accessing the internet from point B, despite being <b>in</b> <b>point</b> <b>A.</b> For example in China VPNs are used to access otherwise blocked content. Yang gives the example of pornography stating that with VPNs “smut that's banned in the U.S. can wind its way into American homes through electrical impulses in, say, Amsterdam.” [...] In this example using VPNs an internet user in the United States could access banned material, which is hosted in Amsterdam, by accessing through a server hosted in Amsterdam to make it appear that they are in Amsterdam based on their IP address. Therefore, citizens have a way around network sovereignty by simply accessing a different server through a VPN. This greatly limits how governments can enforce network sovereignty and protect their cyberspace borders. Essentially {{there is no way that}} a government could prevent every citizen from accessing banned content through means such as VPNs.|$|E

30|$|Defensive {{decision}} making {{is not the same}} as risk aversion in that it can also lead to excessive risk taking.
