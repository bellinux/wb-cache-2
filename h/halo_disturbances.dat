40|$|PURPOSE: To compare disk halo size in {{response}} to a glare source in eyes with an aspheric apodized diffractive multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) or aspheric monofocal IOL. SETTING: Rementeria Ophthalmological Clinic, Madrid, Spain. DESIGN: Prospective randomized masked study. METHOD: Halo radius was measured using a vision monitor (MonCv 3) with low-luminance optotypes in eyes that had cataract surgery and bilateral implantion of an Acrysof Restor SN 6 AD 1 multifocal IOL or Acrysof IQ monofocal IOL 6 to 9 months previously. The visual angle subtended by the disk halo radius was calculated in minutes of arc (arcmin). Patient complaints of <b>halo</b> <b>disturbances</b> were recorded. Monocular uncorrected distance visual acutity (UDVA) and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) were measured using high-contrast (96...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the changes in}} correlations of higher order aberrations of the first corneal surface with halo phenomena, a form of image degradation, under night vision conditions measured objectively after successful LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis) surgery. METHODS: A prospective, observational, analytical study of 110 eyes that had undergone successful LASIK surgery for myopia and astigmatism. Preoperative sphere was (mean (SD)) - 3. 48 (1. 70) D (0 to - 8. 00 D) and preoperative cylinder was - 0. 86 (0. 87) D (0 to - 4. 00 D). Visual <b>disturbance</b> caused by <b>halo</b> phenomena was measured with the Starlights v 1. 0, and pupil size was measured with Colvard pupilometry after adaptation to a dark environment (0. 17 lux). Corneal aberrations were computed for a corneal diameter representative of the eye's entrance pupil under night vision conditions. RESULTS: The <b>halo</b> <b>disturbance</b> index increased in this study {{by a factor of}} 2. 15 after successful LASIK surgery. Total root mean square for monochromatic higher order aberration displayed a significant correlation with <b>halo</b> <b>disturbance</b> index (r = 0. 42; p< 0. 01). However, only secondary astigmatism (r = 0. 36; p< 0. 01), coma (r = 0. 25; p = 0. 02) and spherical aberration (r = 0. 40; p< 0. 01) were responsible for such behaviour, with the remaining corneal aberrations up to the sixth order not displaying any significant correlation when considered individually. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing LASIK procedures display an increase of halo phenomena around lights in night vision conditions, even when the results of the surgery are considered entirely satisfactory according to current international standards of predictability, efficacy and safety. Secondary astigmatism, coma and spherical aberration are the higher order aberrations up to the sixth order that significantly correlated with <b>halo</b> <b>disturbance</b> index...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} methods for {{presbyopia}} treatment. Refractive lens exchange (RLE) followed by multifocal intraocular lens (MFIOL) implantation enables {{high rate of}} spectacle independance but have some visual disturbances. Laser in Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) monovision gives patient ability to have good distant vision with dominant eye and good near vision with nondominant eye. In this prospective randomized study we wanted to compare clinical outcomes in patients who underwent either of the mentioned procedures. The first group included 50 patients (N= 100 eyes) who underwent RLE with MFIOL implantation and the second group included 50 patients (N= 100 eyes) who underwent LASIK monovision as presbyopia treatment. Uncorrected distant, near and intermediate visual acuity, patient’s subjective satisfaction and visual disturbances were measured. Follow up was 6 months. Patients in RLE group had better near uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and patients in LASIK monovision group had better distant and intermediate vision. Patients in RLE group reported visual <b>disturbances</b> (<b>halo,</b> glare). Patients satisfaction and spectacle independance was high in both groups. Refractive lens exchange with multifocal intraocular lens implantation and LASIK monovision are effective methods for presbyopia treatment. LASIK monovision with – 0. 50 D – 1. 25 D of residual dioptry at nondominant eye in patients under 50 years enables good vision at all distances without affecting stereovision. Patient selection and preoperative counseling are key to success.
