5|$|A foot pursuit {{in which}} Diesel, Brewster and Walker are chased across favela rooftops by Johnson and <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>was</b> filmed {{over the course}} of a week in the small {{hillside}} town of Naranjito, Puerto Rico. The scene was considered difficult to shoot, as pathways were slippery from moist tropical heat and the scene involved actors and stunt doubles running while avoiding dogs, chickens and other stray animals loose in the area. To capture the scene, a 420-foot cable-camera rig was used to allow for a fast moving, birds-eye view of the action, and cameras on cranes were set up on rooftops and in alleyways. Walker and Brewster made multiple takes of the conclusion of the scene, requiring them to jump nearly 30 feet from a building onto a waiting safety mat. In total the production employed 236 technicians, 13,145 extras, and generated 16,824 room nights at hotels, contributing $27 million to the Puerto Rican community.|$|E

5|$|Cannon was {{selected}} as the first overall pick the 1960 NFL Draft and as a first-round territorial pick in the 1960 American Football League draft, resulting in a contract dispute that ended in court. Cannon played in the AFL for the Houston Oilers and Oakland Raiders before ending his football career with the Kansas City Chiefs of the NFL. He began his professional career as a halfback for the Oilers. A two-time AFL All-Star, Cannon led the league in rushing and all-purpose yards in 1961. He was named the most valuable player of the first two AFL championship games, which were won by the Oilers. He was moved to fullback and later tight end after being traded to the Raiders, with whom he won another league championship in 1967.

5|$|Duquesne opened conference play on January 6 in a {{match against}} the Richmond Spiders, a team which the Dukes had not {{defeated}} since the Spiders joined the Atlantic 10in 2001. This game marked {{the return of}} Melquan Bolding, {{though he did not}} start and scored only three points in fourteen minutes of playing time. Richmond managed to extend their streak, defeating the Dukes 86–80, while Saunders maintained his nation-leading position and now placed eighth in both blocks and steals. Duquesne then traveled to Dayton, Ohio where they lost to the Dayton Flyers 72–78 in overtime in front of a crowd of 13,435, the largest crowd the team would see all season. Senior Jason Duty was fouled on a 3-point attempt {{at the end of the}} game when <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>was</b> down by one, but made only one of three foul shots, sending the game into overtime. Melquan Bolding scored 13 points in 36 minutes, though he did not start, and Saunders came into the game now leading the nation in rebounds.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} off-season, Tomjanovich and the Rockets civil suit vs. the Lakers occurred. Houston's side argued that Los Angeles {{had failed to}} control Washington. During the trial, {{numerous}} players and coaches {{who were at the}} game testified, while Washington sat at the defense table, listening to himself be portrayed as a dangerous rogue. Kunnert testified during the trial and contradicted Washington's testimony, angrily branding him a liar. While the two were playing for San Diego, their wives became close friends, but their relationship only worsened over time; Washington believed the NBA was keeping Kunnert on his team to prevent him from suing him. Jack Ramsay, Portland's coach, however, said that he chose Kunnert over San Diego center Swen Nater when <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>was</b> asked by the league to submit a list of players they considered fair compensation for Walton.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 the IOC began {{enacting}} {{drug testing}} protocols. They started by randomly testing athletes at the 1968 Winter Olympics. The first Winter Games athlete to test positive for a banned substance was Alois Schloder, a West German hockey player, but <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>was</b> still allowed to compete. During the 1970s testing outside of competition was escalated {{because it was}} found to deter athletes from using performance-enhancing drugs. The problem with testing during this time {{was a lack of}} standardisation of the test procedures, which undermined the credibility of the tests. It was not until the late 1980s that international sporting federations began to coordinate efforts to standardise the drug-testing protocols. The IOC took the lead in the fight against steroids when it established the independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in November 1999.|$|E

5|$|The 1971–72 {{season was}} even worse for the Sabres as they {{finished}} with the fewest wins in the league with 16. Crozier posted a 13–34–14 record and a 3.51 GAA.

According to Jhangiryan, the investigating team considered {{more than a dozen}} theories. By January 2000, Jhangiryan's investigators considered the connection of Kocharyan and his circle to the parliament shooting. Several figures close to Kocharyan were arrested, including Aleksan Harutiunyan, the Deputy Presidential Adviser, and Harutiun Harutiunyan, the Deputy Director of the Public Television of Armenia but, by the summer of that year, they were released.
