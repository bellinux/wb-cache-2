50|$|The {{environment}} {{impact assessment}} survey conducted by NTPC, reports the presence of 27 species of birds that fall into 25 different genera.

50|$|The Australian painted-snipe was {{described}} as Rostratula australis by John Gould in 1838, although later lumped with the similar <b>greater</b> <b>painted-snipe,</b> R. benghalensis as subspecies R. b. australis. However, morphological and genetic differences {{have resulted in the}} species being split in recent years. Such a similarity between the two species can be explained by a recent evolutionary divergence, and is an example of allopatric speciation where the prevention of gene flow by geographical isolation has resulted in an accumulation of differences by genetic drift and differing selection pressures.|$|E

40|$|This study aims at {{determining}} the population size of <b>greater</b> <b>painted-snipe</b> (Rostratula benghalensis, L. 1758) and its habitat characteristics used mainly during the breeding at Wonorejo aquaculture of Surabaya. The data collection {{was done in}} June and July 2009 at Wonorejo aquaculture of Surabaya of East Java by catching the birds using mist nests. Observations were also done using the point counts method. The birds that had been caught were marked using cable ties and a secondary fur cutter, then, released. The population size was counted using Simple Lincoln Index while the habitat characteristics were described based on the meeting location with the birds. Research {{results showed that the}} population of <b>greater</b> <b>painted-snipe</b> at Wonorejo aquaculture amounted to 32. 5 or 33 birds. These birds were very active at night so that they were categorized as nocturnal birds. The existence of these birds at Wonorejo aquaculture scattered in the residential area (the former pond backfilled), the grass marsh (north PLN Wonorejo (State Electricity Enterprise), and bush aquaculture (east PLN). Identified threats included the habitat conversion, the coastal erosion, watersheds, and hunts. Keywords : <b>greater</b> <b>painted-snipe</b> population, aquaculture, Wonorejo aquacultur...|$|E
