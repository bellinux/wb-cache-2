In recent years, the underlying architecture of web wrapping technologies is also been used for other applications such as information integration between legacy systems in large enterprises. Despite the relatively widespread use of this technology, there is currently no uniform way of characterizing web wrapping toolkits, unlike say, a digital camera which can be described in terms of the size of its sensor or storage capacity. The focus of this thesis therefore is to develop a taxonomy or classification scheme that can be used to effectively describe a web wrapping toolkit in terms of its retrieval, extraction and conversion features. For this purpose, some 20 toolkits are studied and of which, verification tests were performed on 9 of these toolkits where <b>evaluation</b> <b>copies</b> are available.

50|$|In January 1985, Digital Research previewed Concurrent DOS 286 in {{cooperation}} with Intel. The operating system would function strictly in 80286 native mode, allowing protected mode multi-user, multitasking operation while running 8086 emulation. While this worked on the B-1 step of prototype chip samples, Digital Research, with <b>evaluation</b> <b>copies</b> of their operating system already shipping in April, discovered problems with the emulation on the production level C-1 step of the processor in May, which would not allow Concurrent DOS 286 to run 8086 software in protected mode. The release of Concurrent DOS 286 had been scheduled for late May, but was delayed until Intel could develop {{a new version of}} the chip. In August, after extensive testing E-1 step samples of the 80286, Digital Research said that Intel had corrected all documented 286 errata, but that there were still undocumented chip performance problems with the prerelease version of Concurrent DOS 286 running on the E-1 step. Intel said that the approach Digital Research wished to take in emulating 8086 software in protected mode differed from the original specifications; nevertheless they incorporated into the E-2 step minor changes in the microcode that allowed Digital Research to run emulation mode much faster (see LOADALL). These same limitations affected FlexOS 286 version 1.0, a reengineered derivation of Concurrent DOS 286, which was developed by Digital Research's new Flexible Automation Business Unit in Monterey, CA, since 1986.|$|R

Specifically, SPR provided data directly correlated to both the years of singing activity and the vocal category of each singer (the higher the singing pitch, the wider the vocal extension). More importantly, the data fully reflected the subjective assessment of each pho- niatrician.

40|$|Bladder cancer {{represents}} the ninth most widespread malignancy throughout the world. It {{is characterized by}} the presence of two different clinical and prognostic subtypes: non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers (NMIBCs) and muscle-invasive bladder cancers (MIBCs). MIBCs have a poor outcome with a common progression to metastasis. Despite improvements in knowledge, treatment has not advanced significantly in recent years, with the absence of new therapeutic targets. Because of the limitations of current therapeutic options, the greater challenge will be to identify biomarkers for clinical application. For this reason, we compared our array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) results with those reported in literature for invasive bladder tumors and, in particular, we focused on the <b>evaluation</b> of <b>copy</b> number alterations (CNAs) present in biopsies and retained in the corresponding cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulations that should be the main target of therapy. According to our data, CCNE 1, MYC, MDM 2 and PPARG genes could be interesting therapeutic targets for bladder CSC subpopulations. Surprisingly, HER 2 copy number gains are not retained in bladder CSCs, making the gene-targeted therapy less interesting than the others.

40|$|Gorlin {{syndrome}} (GS) is an {{autosomal dominant}} disorder that predisposes affected individuals to developmental defects and tumorigenesis, and caused mainly by heterozygous germline PTCH 1 mutations. Despite exhaustive analysis, PTCH 1 mutations are often unidentifiable in some patients; {{the failure to}} detect mutations is presumably because of mutations occurred in other causative genes or outside of analyzed regions of PTCH 1, or copy number alterations (CNAs). In this study, we subjected a cohort of GS-affected individuals from six unrelated families to next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis for the combined screening of causative alterations in Hedgehog signaling pathway-related genes. Specific single nucleotide variations (SNVs) of PTCH 1 causing inferred amino acid changes were identified in four families (seven affected individuals), whereas CNAs within or around PTCH 1 were found in two families in whom possible causative SNVs were not detected. Through a targeted resequencing of all coding exons, as well as simultaneous <b>evaluation</b> of <b>copy</b> number status using the alignment map files obtained via NGS, we found that GS phenotypes {{could be explained by}} PTCH 1 mutations or deletions in all affected patients.

40|$|Aim of the study: <b>Evaluation</b> of <b>copy</b> number {{variation}} (CNV) in BRCA 1 / 2 genes, due {{to large}} genomic rearrangements (LGRs), is a mandatory analysis in hereditary breast and ovarian cancers families, if no pathogenic variants are found by sequencing. LGRs cannot be detected by conventional methods and several alternative {{methods have been}} developed. Since these approaches are expensive and time consuming, identification of alternative screening methods for LGRs detection is {{needed in order to}} reduce and optimize the diagnostic procedure. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate a Competitive PCR-High Resolution Melting Analysis (C-PCR-HRMA) as molecular tool to detect recurrent BRCA 1 LGRs. Material and methods: C-PCR-HRMA was performed on exons 3, 14, 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the BRCAI gene; exons 4, 6 and 7 of the ALB gene were used as reference fragments. Results: This study showed that it is possible to identify recurrent BRCA 1 LGRs, by melting peak height ratio between target (BRCA 1) and reference (ALB) fragments. Furthermore, we underline that a peculiar amplicon-melting profile is associated to a specific BRCAI LGR. All C-PCR-HRMA results were confirmed by Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Conclusions: C-PCR-HRMA has proved to be an innovative, efficient and fast method for BRCA 1 LGRs detection. Given the sensitivity, specificity and ease of use, c-PCR-HRMA can be considered an attractive and powerful alternative to other methods for BRCA 1 CNVs screening, improving molecular strategies for BRCA testing in the context of Massive Parallel Sequencing...|$|R

Given that CCISC can be designed within the resource base of any system, and given that initial projects have been able to describe some early success in creating meaningful shifts in clini-cal practice, the model appears to have some face value in application to complex systems.

We also support the simulation of camera movement (e. g., a hand-held camera) and background insertion. Furthermore, we allow for an easy setup and calibration of all the simulated artifacts, using sample/reference pairs of images and videos.

The study of second subprogram acquired their relative weights by a popular method of weight in the area of decision analysis, the result was as followings: credibility- 0. 27, attractiveness- 0. 24, suitability- 0. 18, affect impact- 0. 16, cognition- 0. 15; and fanally, under the condition of quasi-experiment, the third studyestablished a mathematical model of the synthetic evaluation of television ad copy, which was expressed as O = ΣF * W, through a "synthetical" method of multidimensional decision making. 	广告作品的质量是广告服务质量的重要组成部分。若只有广告作品的设计和制作，缺乏对它的评价，该系统是不完善的。建立广告作品评价系统，正是本研究的主题。本工作从消费者的行为出发，集中地探讨了：（ 1 ）消费者是依据哪些基本因素来评价电视广告作品的；（ 2 ）这些基本因素的相对重视度如何；（ 3 ）消费者是如何作多维决策，以获得一个总体印象评价，即电视广告作品评价数学模型的建立。这三个子问题构成了电视广告作品的评价系统。在第一个子问题的研究中，利用进一步简化后的多级估量量表，调查了消费者对电视广告作品的一般性评价意见，通过因素分析，抽取出五个基本的评价因素：吸引力、可信、认知力、适合性、感染力，解释量达到 56. 2 %，信度为 0. 84 ；第二项研究是采用决策分析中常用的求权方法，研究表明，在消费者心目中，这些因素的重视度是不一样的，它们的权重分别为：可信- 0. 27 ，吸引力- 0. 24 ，适合性- 0. 18 ，感染力- 0. 16 ，认知力- 0. 15 ；最后，在准控制实验的条件下，利用多维决策中的“合成”试验，建立了消费者评价电视广告作品的数学模型：O = ΣΣF_k * W_(kj) 。它揭示了总体评价与各基本因素之间的关系。</p...|$|R
40|$|Microarray-based {{comparative}} genomic hybridization (array CGH) is {{a revolutionary}} platform that was recently {{adopted in the}} clinical laboratory. This technology was first developed as a research tool for the investigation of genomic alterations in cancer. It allows for a high-resolution <b>evaluation</b> of DNA <b>copy</b> number alterations associated with chromosome abnormalities. Array CGH {{is based on the}} use of differentially labeled test and reference genomic DNA samples that are simultaneously hybridized to DNA targets arrayed on a glass slide or other solid platform. In this review, we examine the technology and its transformation from a research tool into a maturing diagnostic instrument. We also evaluate the various approaches that have shaped the current platforms that are used for clinical applications. Finally, we discuss the advantages and shortcomings of “whole-genome” arrays and compare their diagnostic use to “targeted” arrays. Depending on their design, microarrays provide distinct advantages over conventional cytogenetic analysis because they have the potential to detect the majority of microscopic and submicroscopic chromosomal abnormalities. This new platform is poised to revolutionize modern cytogenetic diagnostics and to provide clinicians with a powerful tool to use in their increasingly sophisticated diagnostic capabilities...|$|R
