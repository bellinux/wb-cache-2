25|$|Antoine Balland (27 August 1751 – 3 November 1821) {{commanded}} a French infantry division {{during the early}} years of the French Revolutionary Wars. A former private, he was promoted to command an infantry regiment after the Battle of Jemappes. He became a general of brigade in late August 1793 and a general of division less than three weeks later. Soon afterwards, he led a division in Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's victory at Wattignies. In the spring of 1794, he led his troops at Le Cateau, Beaumont and Landrecies. By this time it was obvious that he did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> to command a combat division and he was replaced by Jean Baptiste Kléber. He was not employed after June 1795 and died at Guise in 1821.|$|E
25|$|One {{of these}} {{students}} was Edwin Catmull. Catmull had just come from The Boeing Company and {{had been working on}} his degree in physics. Growing up on Disney, Catmull loved animation yet quickly discovered that he did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> for drawing. Now Catmull (along with many others) saw computers as the natural progression of animation and they {{wanted to be part of}} the revolution. The first animation that Catmull saw was his own. He created an animation of his hand opening and closing. He also pioneered texture mapping to paint textures on three-dimensional models in 1974, now considered one of the fundamental techniques in 3D modeling. It became one of his goals to produce a feature-length motion picture using computer graphics - a goal he would achieve two decades later after his founding role in Pixar. In the same class, Fred Parke created an animation of his wife's face.|$|E
25|$|In April 1976, Spurrier {{was sent}} to the {{expansion}} Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for two players and a second round draft pick as part of the new franchise's first trade. The Buccaneers' new acquisition generated local excitement, as Spurrier had been a college star at the nearby University of Florida. He won the job as team's first starting quarterback, a position that he later regretted as the undermanned Bucs went on to suffer the first winless season (0-14) in modern NFL history. Though he had looked forward to playing professional football in Florida, Spurrier was frustrated by losing, the constant hits playing behind a porous offensive line, and his philosophical differences with Bucs coach John McKay. McKay insisted on employing a run-heavy attack similar to the offense he had used to win championships at The University of Southern California, while Spurrier felt that the team did not have the right personnel to run the ball effectively and should open up the offense. Another point of contention was Coach McKay's insistence that his son, John McKay, Jr., be the Buc's primary wide receiver while Spurrier and other observers felt that he did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> to fill that role.|$|E

500|$|Lawson {{has become}} renowned for her flirtatious manner of presenting, {{although}} she argues [...] "It's {{not meant to}} be flirtatious. ... I don't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> to adopt a different persona. It's intimate, not flirtatious". The perceived overt sexuality of her presentation style has led to Lawson being called the [...] "queen of food porn". Many commentators have alluded to Lawson's attractiveness, and she was once named as one of the world's most beautiful women. She has been referred to as [...] "stunningly beautiful, warm, honest, likeable and amazingly normal", as well as being described as having [...] "flawless skin, perfect white teeth, a voluptuous body, ample height and lots of lush, brown hair". Nigella Lawson has been voted, Sexiest Celebrity Chef. [...] The media have also noted Lawson's ability to engage with both male and female viewers; The Guardian wrote, [...] "Men love her {{because they want to be}} with her. Women love her because they want to be her". [...] The chef Gary Rhodes said that viewers were attracted to her smile rather than her cooking. Despite often being labelled as a domestic goddess, she insists that she exhibits very few of the qualities associated with the title.|$|E
2500|$|Despite many {{rumors and}} {{reports that the}} Rays would make a deal before the July 31 Trade deadline, the Rays made no trades.

Ringer said of his role, [...] "My {{goal is to make}} sure I keep {{producing}} each chance I get and try to make sure I am being productive, And just continue to do what I can to get better." [...] Titans head coach Jeff Fisher said of Ringer [...] "He's got great run skills and he's in good shape, He's got a sense and a knack for pushing the ball north and south. Again we just finished the first day in pads, and he's probably had 10 reps, so we still have some time." [...] Ringer also said [...] "I am definitely doing a lot of watching, Different things that they do is the reason why they're successful in the NFL, so I am kind of watching and learning and seeing how they go about their business. ... I am asking questions and they've been very helpful with me." [...] Teammate Chris Johnson said of the other backs, [...] "Basically if you <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> to make it here, you pretty much know how to read a defense and know how to run a ball, So there are not a lot of things I can tell him as far as how to run the ball. ... (It's) just making sure I let him know some of the things I did to learn the playbook quickly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Not all reviewers {{praised the}} album, however. Scott Heisel of Alternative Press gave it {{three out of}} five stars, noting that the band's {{extended}} period of inactivity did {{not allow them to}} test the new songs in front of an audience, and thus [...] "the band's fourth proper full-length isn't the New Testament of beard-punk that so many Fest attendees want it to be." [...] He also remarked that their hiatus had distanced them from contemporary punk, and thus Civil War sounds dated and [...] "lacks bite and innovation." [...] Heisel also felt that it did not measure up to the promise of the band's earlier work, stating that [...] "While the album has bright spots, overall it feels a bit dull and without the spark that made 1998's Midwestern Songs of the Americas so fresh and exciting. With the albatross around their neck finally loosened, Dillinger Four <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> to return with another truly great, defining punk album–hopefully it'll be before 2014." [...] Kyle Ryan of The A.V. Club remarked that the album was [...] "mostly interchangeable with its predecessors, right down to the silly samples that bookend the songs" [...] and that [...] "after six long years, it would've been nice for Dillinger Four to deliver something beyond more of the same". He did note, however, that the band's pop tendencies were more prominent than on previous releases, and that Funk's vocals were clearer, citing [...] "Contemplate This on the Tree of Woe" [...] and [...] "Americaspremierefaithbasedinitiative" [...] as strong tracks and saying that [...] "Fruity Pebbles" [...] "may be D4's most accessible song yet".|$|E
2500|$|A {{fourth class}} of racing in BMX which are held at local and {{national}} events are called Opens. Opens are largely exhibition and are a chance to test yourself and practice against better competition without jeopardizing your point standings. You must be registered to race in a points race {{to sign up for}} the Open events. No points are awarded for Opens although trophy places are and the moto qualification rounds are similar to the point races. These are races with more flexible skill level and age requirements. In Opens there are no Novice, Intermediate and Expert divisions. All amateur skill levels are free to participate. The age groupings are generally broader, for example 13-14 open class as opposed to 13 Intermediate and 14 Intermediate being separate groupings for those ages in the points races. Girls may also participate in the male Open class within the proper age ranges. However expert boys are not allowed in these [...] "Mixed" [...] opens. Then an Expert Open is held in that event. The pros are excluded from racing with the amateurs if enough pros are at hand to race that a separate Pro-Open class can be created. If not, then the pros can race in the amateur Open with some restrictions. This is called a Pro-Am event. Except for the Pro-Am exception the Expert racers usually wins the open class. Even if there are Pros in the Open, {{it is not unusual for}} an older Expert-17-18 age class for example-to win since many <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> and speed to be a pro but have not yet taken the opportunity, partly because once you go Pro, you can go back to amateur only under very strict circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|Much of HIM's {{success has}} been {{attributed}} to vocalist and main songwriter Ville Valo. Vesa Sirén of Helsingin Sanomat described the band's music as achieving [...] "major crossover appeal" [...] by combining [...] "traditional Finnish melancholia", with [...] "gothic lyrics, walls of metal guitars, and keyboard riffs." [...] Vesterinen also singled out Valo's songwriting ability as a major component in HIM's success, stating: [...] "Charisma in something that you're somewhat born with [...] writing songs on the other hand is hard to learn, if you don't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> for it." [...] Juhani Merimaa also stated that with [...] "melodic, catchy and good songs", as well as being [...] "credible in the underground, and the mainstream", HIM had [...] "all the elements for breaking through". HIM also gained many fans through Valo's image, which Sirén described as utilizing [...] "the tried and true James Dean -formula, where sensitivity and edginess combined." [...] With all these elements, HIM garnered both male and female fans around the world, with Asko Kallonen, who first signed the band to BMG, recalling: [...] "For example in England it was hard to grasp. There the split was usually clear: hard rock was for guys, pop was for girls. HIM was listened to by both." [...] Juhani Merimaa felt similarly, stating: [...] "Unlike other metal bands, they appealed to the opposite sex." [...] Lance Teegarden of PopMatters has noted that HIM is [...] "not the sort of act that conjures up a lukewarm response [...] people either like them or discredit them outright". Some of the major criticism directed towards the band have centered around the supposed repetitive nature of their music and pandering towards teenage goth fans. HIM's association with Jackass member and skateboarder Bam Margera has also received some negative feedback.|$|E

6000|$|Lord Minchampstead again prospers. Either {{the nuns}} of Minchampstead have left no Nemesis behind them, {{like those of}} Whitford, or a certain wisdom and righteousness of his, however dim and imperfect, averts it for a time. So, as I said, he prospers, and is hated; {{especially}} by his farmers, to whom he has just offered long leases, and a sliding corn-rent. They would have hated him just the same if he had kept them at rack-rents; {{and he has not}} forgotten that; but they have. They looked shy at the leases, because they bind them to farm high, which they {{do not know how to}} do; and at the corn-rent, because they think that he expects wheat to rise again--which, being a sensible man, he very probably does. But for my story--I certainly do not see how to extricate him or any one else from farmers' stupidity, greed, and ill-will. [...] . That question must have seven years' more free-trade to settle it, before I can say anything thereon. Still less can I foreshadow the fate of his eldest son, who has just been rusticated from Christ Church for riding one of Simmon's hacks through a china-shop window; especially as the youth is reported to be given to piquette and strong liquors, and, like many noblemen's eldest sons, is considered 'not to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> of his father.'
