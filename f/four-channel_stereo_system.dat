50|$|The {{company was}} a leading {{manufacturer}} of audio products, including headphone <b>stereos,</b> minicomponent <b>stereo</b> <b>systems,</b> portable <b>stereo</b> <b>systems,</b> minidisc players, CD and cassette players, and car <b>stereo</b> <b>systems</b> throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Nearly 86 percent of company revenues were derived from such audio products. 12 percent came from products such as televisions and VCRs, and the remaining two percent from computer peripherals and other life products.|$|R
50|$|The {{story was}} {{prepared}} in two formats: the ninety-minute version and a four-part version, the latter designed for international distribution or repeat broadcasting {{in the ordinary}} series run. The episode breaks were, respectively: Sarah falling down the slope; the Cybermen placing their bomb outside the TARDIS while Susan and Turlough watch; and the Master appearing behind the First Doctor and Tegan while in the Dark Tower. This is the only programme from the classic series of Doctor Who for which all recorded and filmed material, including alternate and unused takes, fluffed scenes and so forth, still exists in broadcast-quality format. This allowed {{for the creation of}} the 1995 version of the story. The Five Doctors was recorded in <b>four-channel</b> <b>stereo,</b> but broadcast in mono. The later DVD releases had a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{framework}} for novel catadioptric <b>stereo</b> camera <b>system</b> that uses a single camera and a single lens with conic mirrors. Various possible designs of the catadioptric <b>stereo</b> <b>system</b> with single-viewpoint constraint have been developed in this framework. The proposed systems are compact wide-baseline <b>stereo</b> <b>systems</b> with a panoramic view. The simple structures of the systems reduce the problems of misalignment between the camera and mirrors, which make the system free of complex search procedure for epipolar line. The wide baseline enables accurate 3 D-reconstruction of the environment. Additionally, the system has all {{the advantages of the}} single camera <b>stereo</b> <b>system</b> that stem from the same physical characteristics of the camera. The feasibility of the system as a practical stereo sensor has been demonstrated with experiments in an indoor environment. 1...|$|R

40|$|Realtime {{stereoscopic}} {{analysis is}} becoming a realty as microcomputer speeds increase. There are now opportunities for applying stereo ranging to problems in mobile robot navigation. We describe an implemented <b>stereo</b> <b>system</b> for robot map-making and localization, in which the main task is {{to put together a}} floor plan of the environment using data from a passive stereo head. We develop several techniques to make the <b>stereo</b> <b>system</b> usable for this task; the primary ones are a fast multiresolution method for extending the range of the <b>stereo</b> <b>system,</b> and an easy calibration method for setting and maintaining calibration. The resultant system has sufficient accuracy, range, and robustness to extract floor plans as the robot navigates the environment...|$|R
