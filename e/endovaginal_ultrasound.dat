We comprehensively examined the relationship between age at menar-che, fibroid characteristics, and race. Women were enrolled in Right From the Start (2001 – 2010), a multistate study that systematically screened for fibroids during very early pregnancy. <b>Endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasounds</b> were con-ducted, and fibroid presence, number, type, volume, and diameter were recorded according to standardized def-initions. Generalized estimating equations adjusted for correlations within study site were used to estimate associations between age at menarche and fibroid status and to test for interactions with race. Of 5, 023 partici-pants, 11 % had a fibroid. Seven percent underwent menarche before 11 years of age and 11 % at 15 years or later. We did not observe interactions between age at menarche and race. A 1 -year increase in age at menarche was inversely associated with fibroids (adjusted risk ratio = 0. 87, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 82, 0. 91). Early age at menarche had a similar positive association in individual analyses with fibroid size, type, and location but was stronger for multiple fibroids (adjusted risk ratio = 0. 75, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 68, 0. 83). Our findings confirm other reports of an association between age at menarche and fibroid development (regardless of characteristics), demonstrate no effect modification by race, and suggest a stronger association for women with multiple fibroids, possibly reflecting a stronger association for early-onset disease...|$|R
40|$|Heterotopic {{pregnancy}} {{is a condition}} characterized by implantation {{of one or more}} viable embryos into the uterine cavity while another one is implanted ectopically, particularly into the uterine tube. Its occurrence has increased drastically {{over the last few years}} due to assisted reproduction procedures. In general, the diagnosis is made during the first trimester by using <b>endovaginal</b> two-dimensional <b>ultrasound</b> (2 DUS), through observing a complex para- or retrouterine mass in association with a viable uterine pregnancy. However, under some conditions such as atypical ultrasonographic presentations, 2 DUS does not clarify the situation whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis is able to do so. We present the case of a pregnant woman in her fifth pregnancy, with a clinical condition of lower abdominal pain and pallor. Endovaginal 2 DUS showed a complex voluminous mass in the left pelvic region in association with a viable intrauterine pregnancy. 2 DUS in power Doppler mode showed “ring” vascularization, compatible with an ectopic gestational sac. MRI was of great importance in that it suggested that the mass had hematic content, which together with the clinical features, indicated that laparotomy should be performed. This surgical choice was essential for the woman to achieve a clinical improvement and for good continuation of the intrauterine pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|Objective: the {{objective}} of our research was to study uterine artery doppler indices and their evolution over time after metroplasty and subsequent pregnancy in patients whose septate uterus was the only explanation for infertility.

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Our {{aim was to}} {{estimate}} agreement between transperineal and <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> in assessing levator ani biometry and avulsion in nullipara and primipara women and determine agreement between levator avulsion palpation and ultrasound. METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study assessed 269 nullipara women at 36 weeks gestation and 191 primipara women 13 weeks postpartum. Women underwent levator palpation, and avulsion was diagnosed if no attachment to the pubic bone was felt. Subsequently, 3 / 4 D transperineal and 3 D <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> were performed. A standardized protocol was used to perform measurements at rest. Levator avulsion was diagnosed on <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> at rest if > 50 % was avulsed and on transperineal tomographic ultrasound imaging at maximum contraction if the central three slices were avulsed. Levator avulsion was analyzed by two independent, blinded investigators. A third investigator resolved discrepancies. Intraclass correlation coefficient and limits of agreement were calculated for each time point. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficient for levator urethra gap was 0. 44 - 0. 54, hiatus area 0. 76 - 0. 79, transverse diameter 0. 51 - 0. 59, anteroposterior diameter 0. 70 - 0. 72. Levator thickness correlated poorly. <b>Endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> measurements were generally smaller; however limits of agreement were acceptable for hiatus measurements. Overall agreement between both ultrasound techniques in diagnosing levator avulsion was 95 %; correlation 0. 72 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 67 - 0. 76]. Agreement between palpation and transperineal ultrasound was 92 % (kappa = 0. 34), and between palpation and <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> was 92 % (kappa = 0. 37). CONCLUSIONS: Transperineal and <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> can both be used to analyze hiatus area and anteroposterior diameter with the patient at rest and to diagnose levator avulsion.

40|$|Estimates of {{ultrasonic}} attenuation (the loss {{of energy}} as an ultrasonic wave propagates through tissue) {{have been used}} to evaluate the structure and function of tissues in health and disease. The purpose of this research was to develop a method to estimate ultrasonic cervical attenuation during human pregnancy using a clinical ultrasound system. Forty women underwent a cervical scan once during pregnancy with the Zonare® z. one clinical ultrasound system using a 4 – 9 -MHz <b>endovaginal</b> transducer. This <b>ultrasound</b> system provides access to radiofrequency (RF) image data for processing and analysis. In addition, a scan of a tissue-mimicking phantom with a known attenuation coefficient was acquired and used as a reference. The same settings and transducer used in the clinical scan were used in the reference scan. Digital data of the beam-formed image were saved in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format on a flash drive and converted to RF data on a personal computer using a Matlab® program supplied by Zonare. Attenuation estimates were obtained using an algorithm that was independently validated using tissue-mimicking ultrasonic phantoms. RF data were acquired and analyzed to estimate attenuation of the human pregnant cervix. Regression analysis revealed that attenuation was: a predictor of the interval from ultrasound examination to delivery (β = 0. 43, P = 0. 01); not a predictor of gestational age at time of examination (β = − 0. 23, P = 0. 15); and not a predictor of cervical length (β = 0. 077, P = 0. 65). Ultrasonic attenuation estimates have the potential to be an early and objective non-invasive method to detect interval between examination and delivery.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Endocavity {{ultrasound}} {{is seen as}} {{a harmless}} procedure and has become a common gynaecological procedure. However without correct disinfection, it may result in nosocomial transmission of genito-urinary pathogens, such as high-risk Human Papillomavirus (HR-HPV). We aimed to evaluate the currently recommended disinfection procedure for covered endocavity ultrasound probes, which consists of "Low Level Disinfection" (LLD) with "quaternary ammonium compounds" containing wipes. METHODS: From May to October 2011 swabs were taken from <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> probes at the Gynecology Department of the Lyon University Hospital. During the first phase (May-June 2011) samples were taken after the ultrasound examination and after the LLD procedure. In a second phase (July-October 2011) swab samples were collected just before the probe was used. All samples were tested for the presence of human DNA (as a marker for a possible transmission of infectious pathogens from the genital tract) and HPV DNA with the Genomica DNA microarray (35 different HPV genotypes). RESULTS: We collected 217 samples before and 200 samples after the ultrasound examination. The PCR was inhibited in two cases. Human DNA was detected in 36 (18 %) post-examination samples and 61 (28 %) pre-examination samples. After the ultrasound LLD procedure, 6 (3. 0 %) samples contained HR-HPV types (16, 31, 2 × 53 and 58). Similarly, HPV was detected in 6 pre-examination samples (2. 7 %). Amongst these 4 (1. 9 %) contained HR-HPV (types 53 and 70). CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that a considerable number of ultrasound probes are contaminated with human and HR-HPV DNA, despite LLD disinfection and probe cover. In all hospitals, where LLD is performed, the <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> procedure must therefore be considered a source for nosocomial HR-HPV infections. We recommend the stringent use of high-level disinfectants, such as glutaraldehyde or hydrogen peroxide solutions...|$|E

Study Design Markov state transition model of the natural history of endometrial cancer used as the design for the study. Incidence was modeled for the general population and high risk groups (obese, body mass index [BMI] of = 3 D 30 kg/m 2; tamoxifen users). Strategies evaluated were no screening, annual endometrial biopsy, annual <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasound,</b> and annual serum screening. Serum screening was based on a recently described biomarker panel (sensitivity of 0. 98, specificity of 0. 98). Results In the general population model, no screening was least expensive, whereas annual serum screening age at 50 - 75 years had incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $ 60, 363 per year of life saved (YLS) compared with no screening. In a high-risk population (obesity, BMI of = 3 D 30 kg/m 2), annual serum screening at age 45 - 80 years had ICER of $ 41, 226 per YLS compared with no screening.

Preoperative proper diagnosis data about Müllerian anomalies necessary for clear indications of {{how and when to}} operate. Patients and methodsA retrospective MRI study of 34 patients was done in the period from February 2008 to February 2010, their age ranging from 3 months to 38 years (mean 24 years), with uterovaginal anomalies. Ultrasonography was performed for all cases; HSG was performed in 16 cases before MRI imaging. ResultsMRI is the most reliable method for evaluating uterovaginal anomalies, particularly in pediatrics and virgins. MRI is an accurate examination for identification and categorization of MDAs and should be carried out prior to any surgery, in this study MRI allowed correct diagnosis of 34 uterine anomalies (accuracy 100 %) whereas US was correct in 30 out of 34 cases (accuracy 88 %).

40|$|Ovarian {{cancer has}} {{received}} national attention {{as a highly}} virulent disease. Its lack of early warning symptoms {{and the failure to}} develop highly sensitive screening tests have led some physicians to recommend prophylactic oophorectomies to women with relatives who have had ovarian cancer. Others have recommended routine screening of otherwise normal women for CA 125, a circulating tumor marker, and ultrasound examinations. Each of these techniques is associated with substantial false-positive rates that could lead to unnecessary surgery. A review of epidemiologic data suggests that familial ovarian cancer kindreds are rare, but women with first-degree relatives who have had ovarian cancer have a significant risk themselves for developing ovarian cancer. In addition, women with a great number of ovulatory cycles are at an increased risk for the disease. Circulating tumor markers are frequently elevated in women with advanced ovarian cancer, but their value in early detection of ovarian cancer has yet to be established.

This article presents the background, rationale, and structure of the Yale Early Detection Program for ovarian cancer, whose goals are to identify the best techniques for diagnosing ovarian cancer in an early stage, to determine the frequency with which such tests should be employed, to assess false-positive results, and to identify women who might benefit from prophylactic oophorectomies...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} two studies are {{presented}} dealing with diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in reproductive medicine. The first subject is {{to investigate whether}} hysterosalpingography (HSG) prior to laparoscopy and dye should be maintained as a diagnostic procedure in the routine fertility workup. The results of a randomized controlled trial with or without HSG showed that routine use of HSG {{at an early stage}} in the fertility workup prior to laparoscopy and dye does not influence cumulative pregnancy rate compared to routine use of laparoscopy without HSG. HSG can be omitted form the routine investigation in the fertility workup and should only be applied for specific conditions like contraindication for laparoscopy or examining tubal mucosal fold configuration when tubal microsurgery is considered. Chlamydia antibody testing and <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> may replace HSG as screening test prior to laparoscopy. The second subject focuses on therapy in reproductive medicine with the clinically relevant question whether adverse perinatal outcome is related to assisted conception in both singleton and twin pregnancies. We describe the results of a systematic review of 25 controlled studies. We concluded that singleton pregnancies conceived after assisted conception have significantly worse perinatal outcomes than naturally conceived singletons, but this is substantially less so for twins.

40|$|Objective: To compare biopsychologic {{profiles}} {{of women with}} dyspareunia with a matched no-pain control sample, and to determine whether dyspareunia subtypes based on physical findings have different psychosocial profiles from matched controls. Methods: One hundred and five women with dyspareunia and 105 matched no-pain control women underwent standard gynecologic examination, <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasound,</b> and colposcopy. They also completed a structured interview inquiring about pain other than dyspareunia, sexual function, and history of abuse, the Brief Symptom Inventory, the Sexual Opinion survey, and the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Scale. Results: In comparison with women who do not experience pain with intercourse, the dyspareunia sample {{was found to have}} more physical pathology on examination, and they reported more psychologic symptomatology, more negative attitudes toward sexuality, higher levels of impairment in sexual function, and lower levels of marital adjustment. They did not report more current or past physical or sexual abuse. However, when the undifferentiated dyspareunia sample was divided into subtypes based on physical findings from the gynecologic examinations, the pattern of significant differences from controls varied according to dyspareunia subtype. Elevated psychologic symptomatology and relationship maladjustment were confined to the subtype with no discernible physical findings who reported levels of sexual function not significantly different from matched controls. The vulvar vestibulitis subtype suffered the highest levels of sexual impairment although this subtype was not characterized by higher levels of psychologic symptoms than controls. Conclusion: As an undifferentiated group, women with dyspareunia have more physical pathology, psychologic distress, sexual dysfunction, and relationship problems. However, this pattern of differences appears to vary depending on the presence and type of physical findings evident on examination. Dyspareunia is a heterogeneous disorder requiring comprehensive gynecologic and psychosocial assessment to determine differentiated treatment strategies...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} the accuracy and predictive value of transperineal (TPU) and <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> (EVU) in {{the detection of}} anal sphincter defects in women with obstetric anal sphincter injuries and/or postpartum symptoms of faecal incontinence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and sixty-five women were recruited, four women were excluded as they were seen years after their last delivery. TPU and EVU, followed by endonanal ultrasound (EAU), were performed using the B&K Viking 2400 scanner. Sensitivity and specificity, as well as predictive values with 95 % confidence intervals, for detecting anal sphincter defects were calculated for EVU and TPU, using EAU as the reference standard. RESULTS: On EAU a defect was found in 42 (26 %) women: 39 (93 %) had an external (EAS) and 23 (55 %) an internal anal sphincter (IAS) defect. Analysable images of one level of the EAS combined with an analysable IAS were available in 140 (87 %) women for EVU and in 131 (81 %) for TPU. The sensitivity and specificity {{for the detection of}} any defect was 48 % (30 e 67 %) and 85 % (77 e 91 %) for EVU and 64 % (44 e 81 %) and 85 % (77 e 91 %) for TPU, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although EAU using a rotating endoprobe is the validated reference standard in the identification of anal sphincter defects, it is not universally available. However while TPU and/or EVU with conventional ultrasound probes can be useful in identifying normality, for clinical purposes they are not sensitive enough to identify an underlying sphincter defect.

A follow-up exam at 14 weeks MA demonstrated a via-ble fetus and band-like structures (Fig. 2) within the uterus. The bands were attached to the anterior pla-centa and demonstrated blood flow with color Doppler transvaginal imaging (Fig. 3). At this time, a suc-centuriate lobe was suspected, as placental tissue was also seen on the posterior wall of the uterus. Serial ultrasounds were scheduled. At 18 weeks MA, fetal anatomical evaluation was normal and fetal growth was adequate. The placental cord insertion appeared to be in the anterior placenta with a velamentous or near-marginal implantation. The anterior and posterior pla-cental structures appeared to be equal in size (Fig. 4) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{prospective}} investigation was to compare two methods for sheathing of the <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> probe. The study was conducted over a 7 -month period in 1991 - 1992. In {{the first half of}} the investigation, latex examination gloves were used to sheath the endovaginal probe; during the second half of the investigation, latex condoms were used. Following the ultrasound examination, the probes were inspected for gross contamination by the ultrasonographer. The sheaths were then tested for perforations by filling them with water to twice their usual volume and observing for leaks. Fifty unused gloves and condoms were similarly tested to determine the prevalence of preexisting defects. One hundred twenty-eight gloves and 102 condoms from patients were tested. Four gloves (3. 1 %, 95 % C. I. 1. 6 - 4. 6 %) and seven condoms (6. 9 %, 95 % C. I. 4. 4 - 9. 4 %) had perforations (NS). When the probe was covered by a glove, one instance of visible contamination occurred (0. 78 %, 95 % C. I. 0 - 1. 6 %) compared with eight instances when the probe was covered with a condom (7. 8 %, 95 % C. I. 5. 2 - 10. 4 %, P <. 007). The prevalance of preexisting defects in the 50 unused gloves was 2 %, which is not significantly different from the prevalence in used gloves. There were no defects in the 50 unused condoms compared with 7 in the used condoms (P. 057). Visible contamination of the endovaginal probe with blood or genital tract secretions is more likely when condoms are used as sheaths. However, even gloves provide imperfect coverage of the probe, illustrating the need for thorough decontamination of the endovaginal instrument after each use...|$|E
