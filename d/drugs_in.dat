5|$|<b>Drugs</b> <b>in</b> the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 diabetes, {{have been associated}} with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars are not significantly elevated ("euglycemic DKA"). This may be because they were being used in people with type 1 diabetes, but in those with type 2 diabetes it may be {{as a result of an}} increase in glucagon levels.|$|E
5|$|Guidelines {{for the use}} of <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> the {{management}} of cancer pain have been published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and others.

5|$|Ricardo Flores {{said that}} police found date rape <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> his daughter's car, parked about 50 {{blocks from the}} hotel where she died. Her jewelry, money, {{identification}} and credit cards were missing, including about $1,000 her father had given her to purchase a laptop, and over $10,000 she had won earlier at the casino. Stephany reportedly kept this money in her car, but a police search found no money in it.|$|E

5|$|Written by Dennis Spooner, {{this story}} was to be {{concerned}} with a planet where <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> the food and water are used to control the populace. Punishment would be meted out by temporary withdrawal from the drugs which would cause people to see monsters all around them. The storyline for the four-part story was commissioned on 31 January 1975 and the full scripts on 4 February 1975.|$|E
5|$|According to Diane Dimond of Hard Copy, Torbiner's {{records show}} that Robinul and Vistarol was {{administered}} instead of sodium amytal. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was investigating Torbiner's administration of <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> house calls, where he mostly gave patients morphine and Demerol. His credentials with the Board of Dental Examiners indicated that he was restricted by law to administering drugs solely for dental-related procedures, {{but he had not}} adhered to those restrictions. For instance, he had given general anesthetic to Barry Rothman during hair-transplant procedures. Torbiner had introduced Chandler and Rothman in 1991, when Rothman needed dental work.|$|E
5|$|After {{concluding}} {{his service}} as governor, Carroll resumed his law practice in Frankfort, Kentucky. Brown made him {{chairman of a}} non-profit organization to fight <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> 1983. In 1987, he unsuccessfully sought another term as governor, finishing fifth in the Democratic primary behind Brown, Lt. Gov. Steve Beshear, former Human Resources Secretary Grady Stumbo, and the winner, businessman Wallace G. Wilkinson. Carroll again returned to his Frankfort law practice. In 2001, Kentucky's Purchase Parkway was renamed the Julian M. Carroll Purchase Parkway. In 2003, Carroll actively lobbied the General Assembly to legalize casino-style gambling at the state's horse racetracks.|$|E

5|$|Burnet's work on graft-versus-host was in {{collaboration}} with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this {{was known as the}} Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain passenger leukocytes in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune hemolytic anemia. They looked at the inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> human autoimmune disease.|$|E
5|$|Chambers ran a 100m world junior {{record of}} 10.06s in 1997 {{and became the}} {{youngest}} ever world medallist in the event at the 1999 World Championships, taking the bronze.

He began using performance-enhancing <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> 2002 and he was later stripped of the 100m European title and record he achieved that year.|$|E
5|$|Despite a large {{expansion}} of the prison system, the problem of overcrowding remained throughout the 20th century, as did Western Australia's high incarceration rate relative {{to the rest of}} Australia. The nature of prisoners changed, with three times the proportion of 16- to 19-year-olds in 1984 compared to 1898, and a growing over-representation of Aboriginal prisoners to nearly half the incarcerated population. Sentences also increased in length, such that in 1984 more than 80% of inmates were serving more than a year. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was an increasing number of people committed for violent crimes, but still a minority of the population. Both staff and prisoners, however, perceived a notable increase in violence during these years, coinciding with the rise of illegal <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> prison, and of sentences for drug-related offences.|$|E

5|$|During the 20th century, Piccadilly {{became known}} {{as a place to}} acquire heroin. Jazz trumpeter Dizzy Reece {{recalled}} people queuing outside Piccadilly's branch of Boots for heroin pills in the late 1940s. By the 1960s, the street and surrounding area were notorious as the centre of London's illegal drug trade, where heroin and cocaine could be purchased on the black market from unscrupulous chemists. By 1982, up to 20 people could be seen queueing at a chemist dealing in illegal <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> nearby Shaftesbury Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Five {{medications}} {{have evidence}} for long-term use orlistat, lorcaserin, liraglutide, phentermine–topiramate, and naltrexone–bupropion. They result in weight loss {{after one year}} ranged from 3.0 to 6.7kg over placebo. Orlistat, liraglutide, and naltrexone–bupropion are available in both the United States and Europe, whereas lorcaserin and phentermine–topiramate are available only in the United States. European regulatory authorities rejected the latter two <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> part because of associations of heart valve problems with lorcaserin and more general heart and blood vessel problems with phentermine–topiramate. Orlistat use is associated with high rates of gastrointestinal side effects and concerns have been raised about negative effects on the kidneys. There is no information on how these drugs affect longer-term complications of obesity such as cardiovascular disease or death.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Aphrodite Jones, Patrick Treacy, a cosmetic surgeon who treated Jackson between July 2006 and early 2007, as well as shortly before his death, stated {{that he would have}} known if Jackson would have been also treated by another physician and that he never saw any <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> the house. He also said that Jackson did not have insomnia and never asked him for narcotics. Treacy stated Jackson was in good physical health; he said Jackson always insisted on the presence of an anesthetist when Propofol was administered.|$|E

5|$|Malawians gained {{access to}} {{antiretroviral}} <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> 2003, and, with a donation from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria and the election of new President Bingu wa Mutharika in 2004, government interventions increased substantially. However, soon after his election, Mutharika experienced tensions with Muluzi after implementing an anti-corruption program, which distracted the government from addressing the nation's food and HIV/AIDS-related crises. Despite these obstacles, Mutharika successfully developed a National AIDS Policy and appointed a Principal Secretary for HIV/AIDS during his presidency.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people in}} China {{and other parts}} of Asia have a belief that various tiger parts have {{medicinal}} properties, including as pain killers and aphrodisiacs. There is no scientific evidence to support these beliefs. The use of tiger parts in pharmaceutical <b>drugs</b> <b>in</b> China is already banned, and the government has made some offences in connection with tiger poaching punishable by death. Furthermore, all trade in tiger parts is illegal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and a domestic trade ban has been in place in China since 1993.|$|E
40|$|Three {{major areas}} are {{emphasized}} {{for a study}} of <b>drug</b> excretion <b>in</b> breast milk: maternal drug disposition, breast milk pharmacokinetics and neonatal drug elimination. The first two impact on drug dose to infant whereas the last area is crucial to <b>drug</b> accumulation <b>in</b> the infant. Pitfalls in assessment of the <b>drug</b> concentration <b>in</b> milk to plasma (M/P) ratio are illustrated to expose errors <b>in</b> <b>drug</b> dose <b>in</b> milk estimates. Predictions about <b>drug</b> dose <b>in</b> milk must be confirmed by sampling of both milk and infant plasma for drug concentration.
