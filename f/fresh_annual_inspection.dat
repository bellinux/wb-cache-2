40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis examines the consistency o-f {{information contained in}} the <b>Annual</b> <b>Inspection</b> Summary Report and the Shore Base Readiness Report. The objective is {{to determine if the}} facilities deficiencies reported in the <b>Annual</b> <b>Inspection</b> Summary support the readiness ratings on facility condition reported in the Shore Base Readiness Report. The mean percentage deferrable, nondeferrable, and total facilities deficiencies per current plant value of a mission category is calculated and analyzed by analysis of variance tests to determine if there is {{a significant difference in the}} mean percentage deficiencies per current plant value among different readiness ratings. The analysis indicates there is no significant difference of the mean percentage deficiencies per current plant value. The study concludes that the facilities deficiencies reported in the <b>Annual</b> <b>Inspection</b> Summary do not support the readiness ratings on facility condition reported in the Shore Base Readiness Report.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{data collected}} during the <b>annual</b> post-closure site <b>inspection</b> conducted at the Central Nevada Test Area Surface Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 417 in May 2007. The <b>annual</b> post-closure site <b>inspection</b> included inspections of the UC- 1, UC- 3, and UC- 4 sites {{in accordance with the}} Post-Closure Monitoring Plan provided in the CAU 417 Closure Report (NNSA/NV 2001). The <b>annual</b> <b>inspection</b> conducted at the UC- 1 Central Mud Pit (CMP) indicated the site and soil cover were in good condition. No new cracks or fractures were observed in the soil cover during the <b>annual</b> <b>inspection.</b> A crack on the west portion of the cover was observed during the last quarterly inspection in December 2006. This crack was filled with bentonite as part of the maintenance activities conducted in February 2007 and will be monitored during subsequent <b>annual</b> <b>inspections.</b> The vegetation on the soil cover was adequate but showing signs of the area's ongoing drought. No issues were identified with the CMP fence, gate, or subsidence monuments. New DOE Office of Legacy Management signs with updated emergency phone numbers were installed as part of this <b>annual</b> <b>inspection,</b> no issues were identified with the warning signs and monuments at the other two UC- 1 locations. The annual subsidence survey was conducted at UC- 1 CMP and UC- 4 Mud Pit C as part of the maintenance activities conducted in February 2007. The results of the subsidence surveys indicate that the covers are performing as expected, and no unusual subsidence was observed. A vegetation survey of the UC- 1 CMP cover and adjacent areas was conducted as part of the <b>annual</b> <b>inspection</b> in May 2007. The vegetation survey indicated that revegetation continues to be successful, although stressed due to the area's prevailing drought conditions. The vegetation should continue to be monitored to document any changes in the plant community and to identify conditions that could potentially require remedial action to maintain a viable vegetation cover on the site. It is suggested that future vegetation surveys be conducted once every 2 years or as needed to help monitor the health of the vegetation...|$|R

50|$|Flying has the {{potential}} for serious consequences if not done properly and carefully. Just as it would be unwise to fly in an aircraft that is not airworthy, it is unsafe to fly as, or with, a pilot who is medically compromised. <b>Annual</b> <b>inspections</b> are performed on all aircraft to assure that they meet minimum safety standards. Routine medical exams accomplish the same goal for pilots. When an aircraft successfully completes an <b>annual</b> <b>inspection,</b> the inspector endorses in the logbooks to signify the aircraft is airworthy. Similarly, when a pilot successfully passes the flight physical, the physician endorses the Airmen Medical Certificate which the pilot then carries when performing flight duties. This is then evidence that the pilot has met the medical standards for aircraft operation.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this task is to {{evaluate}} the effect of floor settlement on building structure, piping, and equipment foundations between column lines 1 and 2 and B and K of Bldg. K- 311 - 1 (see Fig. A- 1 in Appendix A) at East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP), Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Revision 0 of this document covers the 2005 <b>annual</b> <b>inspection.</b> Revision 1 addresses the 2006 <b>annual</b> <b>inspection,</b> Revision 2 addresses the 2007 <b>annual</b> <b>inspection,</b> and Revision 3 covers the 2008 <b>annual</b> <b>inspection,</b> {{as indicated by the}} changed report title. A civil survey and visual inspection were performed. Only a representative number of points were measured during the 2008 survey. The exact location of a number of survey points in Table A- 1 could not be accurately determined in the 2008 survey since these points had not been spray painted since 2003. The points measured are deemed adequate to support the conclusions of this report. Based on the survey and observations, there has been no appreciable change in the condition of the unit since the 2007 inspection. The subsidence of the floor presents concerns to the building structure due to the possible indeterminate load on the pipe gallery framing. Prior to demolition activities that involve the piping or removal of the equipment, such as vent, purge and drain and foaming, engineering involvement in the planning is necessary. The piping connected to the equipment is under stress, and actions should be implemented to relieve this stress prior to disturbing any of the equipment or associated piping. In addition, the load on the pipe gallery framing needs to be relieved prior to any activities taking place in the pipe gallery. Access to this area and the pipe gallery is not allowed until the stress is released...|$|R
