40|$|Many of split-band Type II solar radio bursts are {{characterized}} by the simultaneous intensity variation between two split band emissions suggesting that {{the origin of the}} two split bands is located in the same place associated with the shock waves propagating through the solar coronal plasma. We propose here the emission mechanism of the split band Type II solar radio bursts in terms of the nonlinear wave particle interactions of cyclotron resonance type shown by ω_H-ω_P-(K_H-K_P) ・V=nω. (n= 1, 2, 3 [...] .) where ω_H, ω_P and ω_C are frequency of higher frequency component of split bands, plasma frequency and cyclotron frequency, respectively. The present hypothesis can be confirmed by studying high resolution spectra in <b>decametric</b> <b>wave</b> length range obtained by Tsukidate radio spectrograph and wide band dynamic spectra given by HiRAS (Hiraiso radio spectrograph). And the image processing technique for the radio spectrograph is also referred...|$|E

The distribution profiles of synchrotron radiation intensity for spherical injection source of relativistic electrons are reduced at different frequencies. An explanation of the observational data obtained on UTR- 2, according to which the size of the supernova remnant at <b>decametric</b> <b>waves</b> is larger than the remnant size at high frequencies, is given.

Using six different coronal/interplanetary density models, we calculate the speeds of shocks from the frequency drifts observed in metric and <b>decametric</b> radio <b>wave</b> data. We compare these speeds with the velocity of the CMEs as observed in the plane-of-the-sky white-light observations and calculated with a cone model for the 7 November 2004 event.

40|$|Radio noise {{continuum}} emission observed in metric and <b>decametric</b> <b>wave</b> frequencies is discussed. The radio noise {{is associated with}} actively varying sunspot groups accompanied by the S-component of microwave radio emissions. It is shown that the S-component emission in microwave frequencies generally occurs several days before the emission of the noise continuum storms of lower frequencies. It is likely that energetic electrons, 10 to 100 Kev, accelerated {{in association with the}} variation of sunspot magnetic fields, are the sources of the radio emissions. A model is considered to explain the relation of burst storms on radio noise. An analysis of the role of energetic electrons on the emissions of both noise continuum and type III burst storms is presented. It is shown that instabilities associated with the electrons and their relation to their own stabilizing effects are important in interpreting both of these storms...|$|E

The creation of the turbo-pause empirical model is also the aim of the paper as well as the identification of turbulence generation mechanisms. As a result new data about the turbulence structure in the terrestrial atmosphere transfer layer have been obtained. The empirical model of turbulence intensity space-time variations in the low thermosphere has been created. The turbulence influence on the mixture propagation in the terrestrial atmosphere, fluctuations of radiosignals of <b>decametric</b> <b>wave</b> band has been investigated.

40|$|Radio noise {{continuum}} emissions {{observed in}} metric and <b>decametric</b> <b>wave</b> frequencies are, in general, associated with actively varying sunspot groups {{accompanied by the}} S-component of microwave radio emissions. These continuum emission sources, often called type I storm sources, are often associated with type III burst storm activity from metric to hectometric wave frequencies. This storm activity is, therefore, closely connected {{with the development of}} these continuum emission sources. It is shown that the S-component emission in microwave frequencies generally precedes, by several days, the emission of these noise continuum storms of lower frequencies. In order for these storms to develop, the growth of sunspot groups into complex types is very important in addition to the increase of the average magnetic field intensity and area of these groups. After giving a review on the theory of these noise continuum storm emissions, a model is briefly considered to explain the relation of the emissions to the storms...|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{relationship}} among three coronal mass ejections (CMEs), observed on 28 October 2003, 7 November 2004, and 20 January 2005, the type II burst-associated shock waves in the corona and solar wind, {{as well as the}} arrival of their related shock waves and magnetic clouds at 1 AU. Using six different coronal/interplanetary density models, we calculate the speeds of shocks from the frequency drifts observed in metric and <b>decametric</b> radio <b>wave</b> data. We compare these speeds with the velocity of the CMEs as observed in the plane-of-the-sky white-light observations and calculated with a cone model for the 7 November 2004 event. We then follow the propagation of the ejecta using Interplanetary Scintillation (IPS) measurements, which were available for the 7 November 2004 and 20 January 2005 events. Finally, we calculate the travel time of the interplanetary (IP) shocks between the Sun and Earth and discuss the velocities obtained from the different data.

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} which supports {{the concept that}} certain of the Jovian <b>decametric</b> radio <b>waves</b> originate as northern hemisphere extraordinary mode cyclotron emissions. The wave signals received by Voyager 1 near 10 MHz shortly after the closest approach to Jupiter were found to exhibit cusps in the fringe pattern which {{can be attributed to}} Faraday rotation in the Io plasma torus. At nearly the same time, the wave polarization near 1 MHz was found to exhibit a sudden reversal of its rotation sense, indicating that the wave path for those frequencies had also become perpendicular to the magnetic field at the spacecraft. It was determined that the waves came from the northern hemisphere at progressively lower altitudes with increasing frequency, and if the source is assumed to be associated with an L = 6 field line, the emission appears to have occurred near the source cyclotron frequency somewhere in the local midnight sector. The evidence indicates that the source is at the Io flux tube and that the emitted wave mode must have been extraordinary. In addition, the emitted wave polarization must have been substantially noncircular which would require a low plasma density near the source, much like that which occurs with auroral kilometric radiation at the earth...|$|R
