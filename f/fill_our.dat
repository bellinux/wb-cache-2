2500|$|A BBC {{investigation}} {{found that the}} aid consignment consisted of [...] "thousands of tons" [...] of aid, including large quantities of much needed building supplies. Israel said humanitarian aid confiscated from the ships would be transferred to Gaza, but {{that it would not}} transfer banned items such as cement. At the same briefing, they said that they found construction equipment, including concrete and metal rods, that were not allowed into Gaza. The IDF said that all of the equipment on board was examined and none of it was in shortage in Gaza. According to Israeli and Palestinian sources, Hamas refused to allow the humanitarian aid into Gaza until Israeli authorities released all flotilla detainees and allowed building materials, which are thought to make up 8,000 of the 10,000 tons of the goods, to reach them. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said, [...] "We are not seeking to <b>fill</b> <b>our</b> (bellies), we are looking to break the Israeli siege on Gaza." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unsworth also {{influenced}} {{some of the}} album's other tracks: she suggested the title of [...] "My Sad Captains" [...] from a line in Shakespeare's play Antony and Cleopatra in which Mark Antony speaks about his drinking partners ("Come, let's have one other gaudy night; call to me all my sad captains; <b>fill</b> <b>our</b> bowls; once more, let's mock the midnight bell"). According to Garvey the song is about [...] "missing my friends that have {{dropped out of the}} drinking culture that we all met in, or moved away, or died". The lyrics for [...] "New York Morning" [...] were adapted from one of Garvey's diary entries about a trip he and Unsworth made to New York City. In an interview on radio station XFM on 24 January 2014, he told presenter Jo Good that the lyrics were [...] "pretty much verbatim, 6 o'clock in the morning, in Manhattan in the Moonstruck Caf√© , it's verbatim how I was feeling as the city was waking up". The track was called [...] "The City" [...] for a short while, until Elbow realised the implications of such a name in their home city of Manchester, where the two rival football teams of Manchester United and Manchester City are often referred to as simply [...] "United" [...] and [...] "City", and the band could have been accused of being partisan. Garvey spent a large part of 2012 in New York while working on the King Kong musical, and he told Q magazine that the time he had spent in the city had been a big influence on the album, saying, [...] "I'm having an intense love affair with Brooklyn. One overarching theme on this record is me flitting between Manchester and New York." ...|$|E
