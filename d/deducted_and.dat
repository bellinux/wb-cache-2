25|$|While the {{reasoning}} behind the system was sound, the timing of rain interruptions remained problematic: as the semi-final between England and South Africa demonstrated, where a difficult but eminently reachable 22 runs off 13 balls was reduced to 22 runs off 7 (the least productive over, a maiden, being <b>deducted)</b> <b>and</b> finally, a preposterous 21 off 1 ball (the next least productive over having given 1 run). It was seen that, if the interruption came during the second innings, the side batting second was at a significant disadvantage – one which was only overcome once, in fact, in England's group-stage victory over South Africa.|$|E

He signed a five-year contract, for €46million and the exchange of Eto'o (valued at €20million) and loan of Alexander Hleb (with an option to purchase for a €10million fee), with a €250million release clause, making Ibrahimović worth €66million. The Hleb deal, however, collapsed. Eventually, Ibrahimović cost Barcelona €69.884million, which included other fees. As per the Inter book, the fee was €69.5million, {{but part of the}} Inter fee (max 5% according to FIFA regulation) were <b>deducted</b> <b>and</b> distributed by Barcelona to youth and young professional clubs of Ibrahimović: Malmö FF and AFC Ajax as solidarity contribution.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most leagues today, where {{income is}} {{generated}} from sponsors and TV {{in addition to}} ticket sales, the Gauliga teams relied on ticket sales as the exclusive source of income. But while in today's leagues the hosting teams keep the cash from the ticket sales, this was handled differently in the Gauligen. In the regular season, in cup matches or other competitive matches, the money was shared between the German Football Association, who received 5% of the income, the hosting club and the hosted club. In particular, the hosting club received 10% for using their ground and 5% for administrative costs. The remaining 75% of the matchday income were shared between the two clubs. These relations changed for the play-offs for the German championship. Here the matches were usually played on neutral ground, therefore 15% of the income were allotted for renting the ground, administrative cost and travel cost for the teams. The remaining income was divided equally between the clubs and the DFB. For the semi-final and final matches, yet another distribution key was applied. In the semi-final, teams received 20% of the net income (that is, after rent, administrative and travel costs had been <b>deducted)</b> <b>and</b> in the final their share was reduced to 15%.|$|E
500|$|After his {{retirement}} from an mechanical failure, Bräck stated it affected his championship chances slightly and {{his retirement}} {{from the race}} was [...] "something that you don't want to have happen but unfortunately it happens sometimes and today {{it was one of}} those days." [...] Three days after the race, Tracy and Takagi was penalized by CART chief stewart Chris Kneifel for [...] "unjustifiable risk" [...] and for causing several caution periods by contact with other competitors. Tracy had two championship points <b>deducted</b> <b>and</b> was placed on probation for the next three road or street course races, while Takagi also had two points taken off his total and was given a probation period of three events. Kneifel said why the penalties were issued: We did not want to simply issue probations without accompanying them with a strong signal that actions like this will not be tolerated. Championship points are very hard-earned, and they're more valuable than money. We want our response to send out the very strong message that this isn't a slap on the wrist, or a token punishment.|$|E

A further US$2million would have gone to each family had the US State Department removed Libya from its list of states regarded as supporting international terrorism, but as this did not happen by the deadline set by Libya, the Libyan Central Bank withdrew the remaining US$540million in April 2005 from the escrow account in Switzerland through which the earlier US$2.16billion compensation for the victims' families had been paid. The United States announced resumption of full diplomatic relations with Libya after deciding to remove it from its list of countries that support terrorism on 15 May 2006.|$|E
