25|$|Garuda Vyuha is worshiped in Tantra for Abhichara and {{to protect}} against Abhichara. However, the <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Garuda is the Sankarshna form of the lord who during {{creation}} primarily possesses the knowledge aspect of the lord (among Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha forms). The {{important point is that}} Garuda represents the five vayus within us : prana, apana, vyana, udana, samana through his five forms Satya, Suparna, Garuda, Tarkshya, Vihageshwara. These five vayus through yoga can be controlled through Pranayama which can lead to Kundalini awakening leading to higher levels of consciousness.|$|E
500|$|While widely {{considered}} to be a pop punk band, Fall Out Boy has also been described as pop rock emo, and emo pop, and cites emo group The Get Up Kids as an influence among many other bands. When interviewed for a retrospective article in Alternative Press at the time The Get Up Kids disbanded in 2005, Pete Wentz stated that [...] "Fall Out Boy would not be a band {{if it were not for}} The Get Up Kids." [...] Early in the band's career, when Jared Logan was producing the group's debut album, he asked bassist Pete Wentz what sound the band desired for recording. Wentz responded by [...] "handing over the first two New Found Glory records". Wentz also cites Green Day, the Ramones, Screeching Weasel, Metallica, Earth Crisis, Gorilla Biscuits and Lifetime as influences. The band acknowledges its hardcore punk roots as an influence; all four members were involved in the Chicago hardcore scene before joining Fall Out Boy. Wentz described the band's affiliation with the genre by saying [...] "I think the <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we are all hardcore kids that are writing pop music...It gives us a different style because at our core we are always hardcore. That aspect is always going to be evident in the music. We are hardcore kids that couldn't quite cut it as hardcore kids." [...] He referred to Fall Out Boy's genre as [...] "softcore": hardcore punk mixed with pop sensibility. Lead singer Patrick Stump, however, is also influenced by artists he listened to while growing up including Prince, Michael Jackson, and David Bowie.|$|E
2500|$|AllMusic's Heather Phares {{scored the}} soundtrack 3 out of 5, writing [...] "True Crime is {{something}} of an achievement when it comes to gathering popular music in support of a video game." [...] She concluded [...] "It's not a perfect soundtrack, but True Crime is entertaining enough to please gaming and non-gaming rap fans alike." [...] IGN's Spence D scored the soundtrack 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "Where The Streets of LA: The Soundtrack really succeeds is {{in the fact that the}} 20 track album features all new material written specifically for the game." [...] He concluded [...] "The most <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> for all intents and purposes the West Coast gangsta scene, musically speaking, has more or less run its course, succumbing to the bling and blitz of the Dirty South. But this album proves that it's still alive and well. Whatever your take on the gunz-n-thugs mentality may be, one thing can't be denied: the 20 tracks included here are rife with game, style, and serious funktafication." ...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> a [...] "cow of stone" [...] moving inside this hill. It's heard by the peoples in the nearby villages that on every Vasubaras, this cow moves inside by the {{distance}} of four grains.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>interesting</b> <b>thing...</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{we had to}} get the {{permission}} of Aaron Copland, the composer. The publishing house said forget it. So I got Mr Coplands home number, called him up and he was very friendly on the phone. And he says [...] "Send it to me, let me listen." [...] And he loved it. He called me and said [...] "This is brilliant, this is fantastic. This is doing something to my music." ...|$|R
5000|$|Another <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> to note <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{track one}} on the album- [...] "Manifestation Of The New Armies"- is misspelled as [...] "Mannifestation".|$|R
6000|$|Now {{it is an}} irritating and pathetic {{thing that}} the three most popular phrases about Shaw are false. Modern criticism, like all weak things, is {{overloaded}} with words. In a healthy condition of language a man finds {{it very difficult to}} say the right thing, but at last says it. In this empire of journalese a man finds it so very easy to say the wrong thing that he never thinks of saying anything else. False or meaningless phrases lie so ready to his hand that it is easier to use them than not to use them. These wrong terms picked up through idleness are retained through habit, and so the man has begun to think wrong almost before he has begun to think at all. Such lumbering logomachy is always injurious and oppressive to men of spirit, imagination or intellectual honour, and it has dealt very recklessly and wrongly with Bernard Shaw. He has contrived to get about three newspaper phrases tied to his tail; and those newspaper phrases are all and separately wrong. The three superstitions about him, it will be conceded, are generally these: first that he desires [...] "problem plays," [...] second that he is [...] "paradoxical," [...] and third that in his dramas as elsewhere he is specially [...] "a Socialist." [...] And the <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when we come to his philosophy, all these three phrases are quite peculiarly inapplicable.|$|E
50|$|One other <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Cenac {{retains its}} old communial washhouse in almost perfect condition.|$|E
5000|$|The {{program began}} as a summer {{replacement}} for The Bob Hope Show.

50|$|In 2010 Polidoro {{was asked}} to write the biography, and {{during the past year}} he spent time looking through the {{material}} gathered by Jillette and Scheinberg, along with the material used for the film “An Honest Liar”. The documentary, directed by Justin Weinstein and Tyler Measom, tells the story of Randi’s life. In an interview Polidoro stated, “ One of the most <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> going through the research about Randi's life, his stories, when he tells them, that's quite something because many times you see they are different, but the original ones, they're even more interesting, more surprising! And that's how memory works.” The biography will be co-authored by Scheinberg with an introduction by Jillette. The current goal is to find a publisher {{by the end of the}} year. Another possibility <b>that</b> <b>is</b> being considered is to launch a fund raising campaign through a crowd-funding website.|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{and compares}} {{compliment}} response strategies (CRS) among Malays and Iranians {{with the aim}} of performing a semantic and pragmatic analysis of complimentary speech acts among Malays and Iranians. The data were collected through the use of interview and Discourse Completion Task (DCT), using eight complimentary sentences. Two were on appearance, two on character, two on ability and two on possession. A total of thirty university-students of the University of Malaya and University Putra Malaysia participated in the study over a period of three months. The findings demonstrated that all Malays and Iranians accepted most of compliments but Malays tended to reject more than Iranians. Although both groups accepted compliments, their strategies for acceptance were different from each other; Malays used more evade strategies than Iranians. Also Iranians used "taarof" strategy as a specific strategy related to Iranian culture for accepting a compliment. The most <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> "Thank you" <b>was</b> used for accepting compliments as the most frequent strategy among both groups...|$|R
50|$|During {{the period}} of the {{assignment}} of the young preachers are usually not allowed to go home parent. Mental far they were prepared to get used to your parents and be independent.

50|$|Palm {{produce is}} about the main export and it sustains many households. The <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these palms trees up till now grow wild. There has been no attempt by locals to turn what is natural into {{organised}} plantations. The government too {{has done nothing to}} encourage local or foreign investors in this area.|$|E
50|$|Itigelov's {{story was}} not {{forgotten}} {{over the years}} and on September 11, 2002 the body was finally exhumed and transferred to Ivolginsky Datsan where it was closely examined by monks and by scientists and pathologists. The official statement was issued about the body - very well preserved, without any signs of decay, whole muscles and inner tissue, soft joints and skin. The <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the body was never embalmed or mummified.|$|E
50|$|Nir {{played for}} Maccabi Netanya, {{where he was}} the second goalkeeper after Liran Strauber. The <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> about it <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> also in Maccabi Tel Aviv he was the second goalkeeper after the same Strauber.|$|R
5000|$|Banapur: Banapur {{is famous}} for Maa Bhagabati (one of the {{incarnation}} of Hindu Goddess Maa Durga) temple. One of the <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> on display <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of a heavy iron piece that floats on water.|$|R
40|$|Before I begin, let's make {{something}} perfectly clear: I am a fish-nerd (i. e., an ichthyologist). For {{the purposes of}} this commentary, that means two things. First, it means that I {{have spent a lot of}} time underwater. Second, although I am I biologist and understand quite a bit about animal physiology, I am not an expert in decompression physiology. Keep these two things in mind when you read what I have to say. Back before the concept of "technical diving " existed, I used to do more dives to depths of 180 - 220 fsw than I care to remember. Because of the tremendous sample size of dives, I eventually began to notice a few patterns. Quite frequently after these dives, I would feel some level of fatigue or malaise. It <b>was</b> clear <b>that</b> these post-dive symptoms had more to do with inert-gas loading than with physical exertion or thermal exposure, because the symptoms would generally be much more severe after spending less than an hour in the water for a 200 -foot dive than they would after spending 4 to 6 hours at much shallower depths. The <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> these symptoms <b>were</b> not terribly consistent...|$|R
5000|$|Another <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{although}} he is a physical scientist, his soul is very romantic. He composed thousands of poems, including the [...] "Hoa Ban" [...] poem collection, [...] "Time and Memory", [...] "Yellow and emerald words" [...] that were publicized. His poems were set to music and broadcast in VTV. He has recently won the golden medal for merits of two scenarios named [...] "Hanoi in the unforgettable times" [...] and [...] "Old Thang Long Memory".|$|E
5000|$|The <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{this flight}} was that gave reason to name, for {{different}} reasons, {{but with the}} same fact, the same Brigadier and his troops of horses, who cross São Paulo to Rio Grande do Sul with their tobiano horses and spread the [...] "Pampa" [...] name, because {{of the relationship of}} the origin of the horses with the Rio Grande do Sul biome, and [...] "Tobiano" [...] because of the name of Brigadier (Tobias).|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Alex Henderson awarded the album 3½ stars stating [...] "The <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> while Universal Syncopations 2 {{stresses}} ensemble playing and team work, {{parts of the}} album are quite free; this disc offers an inside/outside perspective, sometimes moving into mildly avant-garde territory but never favoring outright chaos. A quintessentially ECM aesthetic is very much at work on this solid effort, which will be enthusiastically welcomed by those who complain that Vitouš hasn't recorded often enough as a leader".|$|E
5000|$|Vinblastine and {{vincristine}} {{were isolated}} from the Madagascar periwinkle Catharanthus roseus. Madagascar traditionally used the vinca rosea to treat diabetes. In fact {{it has been used}} for centuries throughout the world to treat all kinds of ailments from wasp stings in India, to eye infections in the Caribbean. In the 1950s researchers began to analyse the plant and discovered that it contained over 70 alkaloids. Some were found to have effect on lower blood sugar levels and others act as hemostatics. The most <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> vinblastine and vincristine, were found to lower the number of white cells in blood. A high number of white cells in the blood indicates leukemia, so a new anti-cancer drug had been discovered. These two alkaloids bind to tubulin to prevent the cell from making the spindles that it {{needs to be able to}} divide. This is different from the action of taxol which interferes with cell division by keeping the spindles from being broken down. Vinblastine is mainly useful for treating Hodgkin's lymphoma, advanced testicular cancer and advanced breast cancer. Vincristine is mainly used to treat acute leukemia and other lymphomas.|$|R

We give conditions on q, ∆ so that if these conditions are satisfied, Glauber dynamics will converge in O(n log n) time from a random (improper) start. The <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> here <b>is</b> <b>that</b> for k ≥ 3 we can take q = o(∆). ...|$|R
40|$|School {{drop-out}} is {{a social}} problem of considerable scope in the Netherlands. Especially the drop-out rate in the lower Intermediate Vocational Training is remarkably high. This rate has also stabilized {{in the past four}} years. This study examined the influence of internship experiences on school drop out of students, who studied Sports and Movement in the lower Intermediate Vocational Training in the Netherlands. Questionnaires were held with the ex-students to gain general information about this educational problem. In-depth interviews with teachers and ex-students were held to gain more insight into the complex interdependent factors like the internship. This can cause early school leaving as experienced by the leavers themselves. It <b>was</b> found <b>that</b> several factors contributed to early school leaving; however, school-intern factors like dissatisfaction with the contain of lessons, the approach of teachers and their lack of involvement with the students were found most. The most <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> the influence of internship experiences was underestimated by both teachers and ex-students. Bad internship experiences could have a great constant background influence on the students motivation for school, and in the process that leads to early school leaving. Especially fluctuating internship hours, time pressure and a lack of school involvement caused problems...|$|R

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{sedation}} drugs, which can be taken by mouth. They have been developed specifically for the purpose of conscious sedation in dentistry. Sleep dentistry is a common term once used to describe a visit to the dentist. The <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> though it was referred to as sleep dentistry, the patient never actually went to sleep during the visit. Sleep dentistry should really be applied to dentistry which uses the aid of general anesthesia. The dentist will determine which medication is best used during sedation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{hidden track}} [...] "Excess Baggage" [...] starts with Staind frontman, Aaron Lewis, walking into, presumably, a bathroom. He {{sits down on}} the toliet with the seat down, and you can hear some metal clanging and then the metal falls to the floor. No one really knows what made the noise. Then Aaron takes a sip of a beverage, or wine, from a wine glass. Then he starts playing the song. An <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Aaron was unaware he was being recorded.

3000|$|These debates are, in themselves, hardly novel. However, the <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> here <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{political}} discussion {{serves to}} fuel a product launch. Something has happened {{when it is}} the op-ed page, not the business pages or the glossy weekend lifestyle magazines, that {{spread the word about}} new entrepreneurial ventures. The point is not so much that the media has been fooled by shrewd marketers, but that this (legitimate) political discussion has generated consumer interest in a new product. Are we, in light of an increasingly globalised entrepreneurship, likely to see more of these political controversies? [...]...|$|R

Pepita Tudó was portrayed by Penélope Cruz in the 1999 film Volavérunt.|$|R
40|$|The {{growth in}} {{computing}} power has enabled the storage {{and analysis of}} large volumes of data. Monitoring the Internet access profiles of millions of users has become feasible and also economically lucrative. The <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> here <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> not only the crooks {{who are interested in}} privacy intrusion, but government agencies also have vested interest in profiling the population mass. This paper describes 4 design patterns that can aide the decision making process for the designers of privacy protecting systems. These design patterns are applicable to the design of anonymity systems for various types of online communication, online data sharing, location monitoring, voting and electronic cash management...|$|R
5000|$|... “The <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in {{teaching}} writing, we often unmask our own processes in readers and writers, thinking aloud {{in front of}} our kids so they can learn how good readers and writers think about texts" [...] (Calkins, Hartman, White, 2005, p. 62). The teacher knows it is important while facilitating the start of the conference to begin with a positive comment about the student’s writing piece. One way to get better on forming instructional needs is to take time to look at “student work outside of class time and thinking about the decision you might make for this student” (Calkins, Hartman, White, 2005, p. 62).|$|E

50|$|The Third Amanda's {{support for}} Hal Mayne {{is part of}} another trilogy of {{characters}} that combine the three parts of humanity as Gordon R. Dickson envisions. She is the strength, the courage, and the competence that compliments the other two muses in his life. Rukh Tamani, who embodies Faith, and Ajela who embodies Understanding being these other two components based on the Childe Cycle splinter cultures. The <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{each of these three}} characters embodies all three of the important philosophies: Courage, Faith, Understanding. The only difference is their emphasis of one over the other two. The Third Amanda certainly possesses both Faith and Understanding, but it is her Courage and Personal Responsibility that are paramount to her character.|$|E

40|$|PurposeThe aim of {{hospice care}} {{is to provide}} the best {{possible}} quality of life both for people approaching the end of life and for their families and carers. The Korean government has been implementing a pilot project for hospital hospice services and trying to develop the national hospice system. To assist {{in the development of the}} Korean hospice system, the Korean government supported the present study comparing the hospice systems of three countries, United States, Japan, and Taiwan, which currently have a developed hospice system. MethodsData from three countries were collected in the following ways: reviewing hospice related literature, searching government documents on the Internet, collecting government hospice data, surveying six hospice institutions in each country, and conducting an international workshop. ResultsThe hospice system was evaluated by comparing hospice management systems and hospice cost systems. The comparison of the hospice management system included five items of hospice infra structures and four items of hospice services. The hospice cost system included four items: funding source, hospital hospice cost, day care hospice cost, and home hospice cost. ConclusionsBased on the comparison of three countries, the most <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> home hospice care accounted for more than 90 % of all hospice services in the United States and Taiwan. The results of this study will aid the countries <b>that</b> <b>are</b> in the process of developing a hospice system including Korea, which has been implementing a pilot project only for hospital hospice services...|$|R
