40|$|The {{turbocharged}} {{direct injection}} stoichiometric spark ignition gasoline engine {{has less than}} diesel full load brake engine thermal efficiencies and much larger than diesel penalties in brake engine thermal efficiencies reducing the load. This engine has, however, a much better power density, and therefore may operate at much higher {{brake mean effective pressure}} (BMEP) values over driving cycles thus reducing the fuel economy penalty of the vehicle. This engine also has the advantage of the very well developed three way catalytic (TWC) converter after treatment to meet future emission regulations. Replacement of fossil gasoline with renewable gasoline-like fuels has major advantages. Ethanol and methanol have larger than <b>gasoline</b> <b>resistance</b> to knock and heat of vaporization, and this ultimately translates in larger than gasoline compression ratio and boost pressure and spark advances closer to maximum brake torque producing better efficiencies both full and part load. For the specific of these novel turbocharged direct injection stoichiometric spark ignition renewable gasoline-like engines coupled to a hybrid-electric power train, the paper considers the option to boost the total fuel conversion efficiency generating both mechanical and electric energy. When the internal combustion engine operates, significant fuel energy is lost in both the exhaust and the coolant. Part of this energy is recovered here by using organic Rankine cycle (ORC) systems fitted to both the exhaust and the coolant, with their expanders driving generators charging the battery of the ca...|$|E

25|$|Spark {{ignition}} {{engines are}} designed to burn gasoline in a controlled process called deflagration. However, the unburned mixture may autoignite by detonating from pressure and heat alone, rather than ignite from the spark plug at exactly the right time. This causes a rapid pressure rise which can damage the engine. This {{is often referred to}} as engine knocking or end-gas knock. Knocking can be reduced by increasing the <b>gasoline's</b> <b>resistance</b> to autoignition, which is expressed by its octane rating.|$|R
5000|$|Upstream blending: Fuels {{are mixed}} in the liquid phase, one with low {{ignition}} resistance (such as diesel) {{and a second}} with greater <b>resistance</b> (<b>gasoline).</b> Ignition timing varies with the ratio of these fuels.|$|R
40|$|Gasoline {{anti-knock}} quality, {{defined by}} the research and motor octane numbers (RON and MON), is important for increasing spark ignition (SI) engine efficiency. <b>Gasoline</b> knock <b>resistance</b> can be increased using a number of blending components. For over two decades, ethanol has become a popular anti-knock blending agent with gasoline fuels due to its production from bio-derived resources. This work explores the oxidation behavior of two oxygenated certification gasoline fuels and the variation of fuel reactivity with molecular composition. Ignition delay times of Haltermann (RON =[*] 91) and Coryton (RON =[*] 97. 5) gasolines have been measured in a high-pressure shock tube and in a rapid compression machine at three pressures of 10, 20 and 40  bar, at equivalence ratios of φ[*]=[*] 0. 45, 0. 9 and 1. 8, and in the temperature range of 650 – 1250  K. The {{results indicate that the}} effects of fuel octane number and fuel composition on ignition characteristics are strongest in the intermediate temperature (negative temperature coefficient) region. To simulate the reactivity of these gasolines, three kinds of surrogates, consisting of three, four and eight components, are proposed and compared with the gasoline ignition delay times. It is shown that more complex surrogate mixtures are needed to emulate the reactivity of gasoline with higher octane sensitivity (S = RON–MON). Detailed kinetic analyses are performed to illustrate the dependence of gasoline ignition delay times on fuel composition and, in particular, on ethanol content...|$|R
40|$|A pseudo {{homogeneous}} two-dimensional (2 D) {{model of}} an industrial Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) riser is here presented. The FCC riser models of previous researchers were mostly {{based on the}} assumption of negligible mass transfer resistance and 1 D plug flow. These assumptions undermine the accuracy of the models by over-predicting the optimum residence time of the riser. In this work the coke content of FCC catalyst was modeled {{as a function of the}} reactor temperature with the aim of predicting the operating conditions that will reduce coke on catalyst without undermining the yield of the key product (<b>gasoline).</b> Mass transfer <b>resistance</b> was incorporated in the reactor model to enhance the accuracy of the results. Catalyst deactivation was modeled based on the exponential decay function. The mass transfer coefficient and the catalyst effectiveness factor were estimated from empirical correlations obtained from literature. Data used for the simulation were sourced from an existing plant (KRPC) as well as from open literature. Finite difference numerical scheme was used to discretise the model governing equation. At the end of the investigation, three different operating temperature regimes were identified from the simulated results for the coking of FCC catalyst (low temperature, optimal temperature and high temperature regimes). An optimum operating temperature range of 786 K- 788 K and an optimum catalyst-to-oil ratio (COR) range of 4. 60 - 4. 71 were predicted for the riser...|$|R
