40|$|The <b>escalation</b> of {{commitment}} {{has been an}} important research topic in managerial decision making for decades. Researchers have identified various cognitive and affective factors influencing individuals’ propensity to allocate additional resources to failing courses of action. This literature is however suffering from fragmentation in term of the diversity of conceptual lenses and the cognition–affect divide. In this thesis, I propose a “process model of affect and the <b>escalation</b> {{of commitment}}” to provide coherence to existing literature. This process model suggests that <b>escalation</b> situations are events to be appraised by decision makers; cognitive appraisals of <b>escalation</b> situations elicit integral emotions which directly impinge on <b>escalation</b> decisions. Moreover, incidental affect creates the context through which decision makers appraise <b>escalation</b> situations; it shapes <b>escalation</b> decisions via biasing appraisal content and influencing the amount of information deliberation. According to this process model, affective and cognitive antecedents jointly influence <b>escalation</b> decisions in multiple ways: affect can mediate as well as moderate the impacts of cognitive antecedents on <b>escalation,</b> it can also biases decision makers’ perception of cognitive antecedents, imposing an indirect effect on <b>escalation.</b> Two sets of laboratory studies are reported in this thesis to illustrate the joint influence of affect and cognition on <b>escalation.</b> Study 1 shows that integral regret mediates the influence of personal responsibility on <b>escalation.</b> Studies 2 and 3 demonstrate that incidental pride weakens the effects of personal responsibility and expectancy-related information on <b>escalation.</b> Implications of the process model and the three empirical studies are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{theoretical}} and empirical investigation of the <b>escalation</b> process that results when states are in dispute over some issue(s) in the international system. <b>Escalation</b> {{is viewed as a}} cost-imposing bargaining strategy enacted by states for the purpose of eliciting concessions from the adversary. Each state has a cost tolerance which identifies the maximum costs a state is willing to suffer to achieve their demand on the issue at stake. A player determines the likelihood that <b>escalation</b> will produce the adversary's concession by comparing the cost tolerances of both players. Once a player decides that the opponent has a greater willingness to bear the costs of <b>escalation,</b> that player concedes and quits the <b>escalation</b> game. A formal theory of the <b>escalation</b> process is developed which produces several hypotheses identifying the conditions under which states are expected to escalate in conflict and, once the decision to escalate is made, the level of <b>escalation</b> that that state is likely to achieve. One advantage in developing a general theory of <b>escalation</b> is that the interrelationships among the variables are expected to hold across a wide variety of <b>escalation</b> contexts. These hypotheses are then tested empirically in order to assess the utility of the general theory of <b>escalation.</b> In one of these contexts, the extended deterrence crisis, potential attackers are expected to refrain from pursuing higher levels of <b>escalation</b> when the attacker can perceive the value that the defender attaches to its ally and when the defender has the capacity to impose serious <b>escalation</b> costs on its opponent. Another of the hypotheses tested produced the expectation that lower cost tolerant actors were more likely to achieve their highest level of <b>escalation</b> on their first move in the conflict given that they were unable to prevail in a long, drawn-out game of <b>escalation</b> with their stronger opponent. The results of the empirical tests indicate that the general theory of <b>escalation</b> developed in the thesis is useful in identifying the conditions that motivate states to escalate, the level of <b>escalation</b> that is likely to be achieved and the conditions under which states concede...|$|R

A squadron of Harrier IIs was stationed at Gioia del Colle Air Base in Italy, relieving an earlier deployment of RAF SEPECAT Jaguars. Both attack and reconnaissance missions were carried out by the Harriers, which had been quickly modified to integrate GPS navigation for operations in the theatre. More than 126 strike sorties were carried out by Harrier IIs, often assisted by Jaguar fighter-bombers acting as designators for laser-guided bombs such as the Paveway II.

40|$|Study objective: <b>Escalation</b> {{policies}} {{are used by}} emergency departments when responding {{to an increase in}} demand (e. g., a sudden inflow of patients) or a reduction in capacity (e. g., a lack of beds to admit patients). The policies aim to maintain the ability to deliver patient care, without compromising safety, by modifying ‘normal’ processes. The study objective was to examine <b>escalation</b> policies in theory and practice. Methods: This was a mixed-method study, involving: i) a conceptual analysis of NHS <b>escalation</b> policies (n= 12) and associated <b>escalation</b> actions (n= 92); and ii) a detailed ethnographic study of <b>escalation</b> in situ over an eighteen-month period in a large UK emergency department (n= 30 observations). Results: The conceptual analysis of NHS <b>escalation</b> policies found that their use requires the ability to: i) dynamically reconfigure resources (staff and equipment); ii) change workflow; and iii) relocate patients. In practice it was discovered that when the emergency department is under pressure, these prerequisites cannot always be attained. Instead, <b>escalation</b> processes were adapted to manage pressures informally. This adaptive need (‘work as done’) was found to be incompletely specified in policies (‘work as imagined’).
