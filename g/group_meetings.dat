5|$|Super Mario 3D Land {{development}} was heavily {{affected by the}} Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that occurred on March 11, 2011. The disaster caused public transportation to shut down, preventing Nintendo staff {{from being able to}} commute to work, and the Tokyo office remained closed for about a week. Hayashida was inspired by the disaster to encourage his team to communicate more, setting up the office such that staff members could easily see and discuss each other's work. The team also started holding <b>group</b> <b>meetings</b> to play-test 3D Lands levels. Hayashida later mentioned that the team expressed hope that the game would inspire joy in spite of the tragedy.|$|E

5|$|The Vidiians' culture also shifts as {{a result}} of the Phage. In Vidiian society, an {{individual}} would hire a specialist, or a honatta, to find the required organs or tissues. Extended periods of contact or <b>group</b> <b>meetings</b> are strongly discouraged to prevent the further spread of the Phage, and those infected are shunned by healthy Vidiians out of fear of contamination. The Vidiians also capture other species to work for them as slaves doing manual tasks, such as mining. In the years following Voyager encounters with the Vidiians but prior to their return to Earth, a committee of alien intellectuals known as the Think Tank claimed to have cured the Phage.|$|E

5|$|Despite the 1965 agreement, the Parliament's seat {{remained}} {{a source of}} contention. Wishing {{to be closer to}} the activities in Brussels and Luxembourg, a few plenary sessions were held by the Parliament between 1967 and 1981 in Luxembourg instead of Strasbourg—against the wishes of France—and in 1981 it returned to holding sessions entirely in Strasbourg. In the previous year it unsuccessfully issued an ultimatum to the national governments, attempting to force them to reach an agreement. Thus, the Parliament moved some of its decision-making bodies to Brussels, along with its committee and political <b>group</b> <b>meetings,</b> and in 1985 it also built a plenary chamber in Brussels for some part-sessions. All the Parliament's attempts in this field were challenged by member states.|$|E
