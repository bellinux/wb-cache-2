5|$|The upper classes' {{need for}} a cheap and {{plentiful}} labor force, the instinctive willingness of the clergy of the state church to discourage emigration on both moral and social grounds, and the deference of the lower orders to the arcade of powers that <b>hovered</b> above them—all these things formed an architecture of cultural hesitancy concerning emigration.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{received}} an informal education in Latin, geometry and mathematics. In later life, Leonardo recorded only two childhood incidents. One, which he {{regarded as an}} omen, was when a kite dropped from the sky and <b>hovered</b> over his cradle, its tail feathers brushing his face. The second occurred while he was exploring in the mountains: he discovered a cave and was both terrified that some great monster might lurk there and driven by curiosity {{to find out what}} was inside.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{foraging}} technique of Ospreys Pandion haliaetus during different wind speed conditions at Lake Hammarsjon, Sweden in autumn 2003. Different fishing techniques were {{used with a}} shift in relation to wind speed: (1) without <b>hovering,</b> (2) <b>hovering</b> with pure flapping flight, (3) <b>hovering</b> with flapping flight and gliding into the wind, and (4) <b>hovering</b> with pure gliding. The results supported our predictions that <b>hovering</b> is constrained at low wind speeds and gliding restricted to wind speeds exceeding 7 m/s. Mixing flapping and gliding flight when <b>hovering</b> may be done as a trade-off between increased fishing efficiency associated with flapping flight and energy-saving combined with gain in total <b>hovering</b> time associated with gliding intervals. The relationship between <b>hovering</b> time and wind speed differed significantly between males and females. At wind speeds up to about 3. 0 m/s, the <b>hovering</b> time increased more steeply with increasing wind speed for males than for females. In contrast, <b>hovering</b> time was shorter for males than for females at high wind speeds. The juveniles showed a lower mean, smaller scatter, and less increase in <b>hovering</b> time along the wind speed gradient...|$|R

5|$|The {{next night}} at 1945 hrs, a craft {{similar to the}} one the night before {{approached}} the base. In addition to being tracked on radar, it <b>hovered</b> around the area for 30 minutes, with characteristics of movement similar to a helicopter. Additionally, it <b>hovered</b> above the weapons storage area at the same altitude as the night before. At this time, possibly another object (it is unclear if it was the same one as the over the weapons storage area, but it is possible) was spotted over the flightline. The cigar-shaped object was described as hovering in mid-air, jerking around, and turning on and off its lights once. During the blackout, it traveled from the flightline, to the northern end of the runway. According to one service member, the object was chased, and eventually discovered to be hovering five feet off the ground. During this time, it was determined that the object was four car lengths long.|$|E
40|$|We present <b>Hover</b> Widgets, a new {{technique}} for increasing the capabilities of pen-based interfaces. <b>Hover</b> Widgets are implemented by using the pen movements above the display surface, in the pen tracking state. Short gestures while <b>hovering</b> followed by a pen down access the <b>Hover</b> Widgets, {{which can be used}} to activate localized interface widgets, such as marking menus [9] or virtual scroll rings [13]. By using the tracking state movements, <b>Hover</b> Widgets create a new command layer which is clearly distinct from the input layer of a pen interface.

5|$|At the episode's conclusion, Jenner {{purposely}} {{calls for}} the self-destruction of the building, which ultimately explodes shortly thereafter. A plate was installed on set, which <b>hovered</b> over pyrotechnics. The plate was turned upside down to create an optical effect where the flame travels across the panel. This created an illusion that the explosion was expanding. The sequence was divided into six different cuts; the first one consisted of the rupture glass of the building, while the last frame concluded {{with the collapse of}} the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.|$|E
5|$|England's bodyline tactics, which {{involved}} bowling at speeds of around 150km/h at the heads and torsoes of the Australian batsmen—including Woodfull—and employing a close leg-side cordon to catch balls fended {{away from the}} upper body, caused great controversy and ill-feeling among Australian players and crowds. England devised the tactics {{in an attempt to}} curb Donald Bradman, Australia's star batsman, whose average <b>hovered</b> around 100, around twice that of all other world-class batsman. However, they also hoped to restrict the other batsmen, Woodfull among them, through such means.|$|E
5|$|The Australian cricket team toured England in 1930. Australia won the five-Test series 2–1, and Donald Bradman scored 974 runs at a {{batting average}} of 139.14, an {{aggregate}} record that still stands in 2017. By {{the time of}} the next Ashes series of 1932–33, Bradman's average <b>hovered</b> around 100, approximately twice that of all other world-class batsmen. The English cricket authorities felt that new tactics would be required to prevent Bradman being even more successful on Australian pitches; some critics believed that Bradman could be dismissed by leg-spin as Walter Robins and Ian Peebles had supposedly caused him problems; two leg-spinners were included in the English touring party of 1932–33.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{bird species}} use <b>hovering,</b> one family even {{specialized}} in it. True <b>hovering</b> by generating lift through flapping alone {{rather than by}} passage through the air demands a lot of energy.

Although not a true <b>hover,</b> some birds remain in a fixed position relative to the ground or water by flying into a headwind. Kestrels, terns and even hawks use this wind <b>hovering.</b>|$|R

5|$|The main display map of {{the game}} is focused on Cyrenaica, a {{representation}} of the Allied minefield that was laid in the Gazala Line between Gazala and Bir Hachieim. The Axis troops begin the game on the western side of the line, whilst Allied forces begin the offensive in British Egypt. A command box in the game provides the player with an instant report of a unit or landscape once <b>hovered</b> over; data given on units includes their strength in terms of supply of infantry, provisions, artillery, and the number of moves that unit can make on one turn. Every two turns lasts one in-game day and units are available to enter combat phases once a day is finished.|$|E

5|$|After a long minority, the {{personal}} reign of James V saw the court become a centre of Renaissance patronage, but it ended in military defeat and another long minority for the infant Mary Queen of Scots. Scotland <b>hovered</b> between dominance by the English and French, {{which ended in}} the Treaty of Edinburgh 1560, by which both withdrew their troops, but leaving the way open for religious reform. The Scottish Reformation was strongly influenced by Calvinism leading to widespread iconoclasm {{and the introduction of}} a Presbyterian system of organisation and discipline that would {{have a major impact on}} Scottish life. In 1569 Mary returned from France, but her personal reign deteriorated into murder, scandal and civil war, forcing her to escape to England where she was later executed and leaving her Protestant opponents in power in the name of the infant James VI. In 1603 he inherited the thrones of England and Ireland, creating a dynastic union and moving the centre of royal patronage and power to London.|$|E
5|$|As they <b>hovered</b> {{above the}} target, however, the first {{helicopter}} experienced a hazardous airflow condition {{known as a}} vortex ring state. This was aggravated by higher than expected air temperature ("a so-called 'hot and high' environment") and the high compound walls, which stopped the rotor downwash from diffusing. The helicopter's tail grazed one of the compound's walls, damaging its tail rotor, and the helicopter rolled onto its side. The pilot quickly buried the aircraft's nose {{to keep it from}} tipping over. None of the SEALs, crew and pilots on the helicopter were seriously injured in the soft crash landing, which ended with it pitched at a 45-degree angle resting against the wall. The other helicopter landed outside the compound and the SEALs scaled the walls to get inside. The SEALs advanced into the house, breaching walls and doors with explosives.|$|E

Immediately, Hmong soldiers and their CIA commanders rushed the TACAN site and shouted to the U.S. technicians that help was coming. In response, the North Vietnamese Special Forces organized a defense around the TACAN site, and hid their dead and wounded comrades under the large rocks which dotted Phou Pha Thi. While U.S. fighter-bombers strafed the TACAN site, the Air America helicopter landed on the airstrip and they picked up two CIA officers, one forward air-controller, and five technicians who hid during the firefight. Later in the day, Air America was able to recover or account for eight of the dead U.S. personnel on Lima Site 85, along {{with a number of}} wounded Hmong soldiers.

40|$|Glossophagine phyllostomid bats, {{commonly}} known as flower bats, range in mass up to 32 g and are the largest vertebrates capable of sustaining <b>hovering</b> flight. Although <b>hovering</b> duration in glossophagines is typically < 1 s, <b>hovering</b> bouts can be much longer under experimental conditions and may last up to 17 s (see Voigt and Winter, 1999). <b>Hovering</b> in flower bats {{is associated with a}} partial supination of distal wing regions that yields vertically oriented lift during the upstroke (von Helversen, 1986). This kinematic feature distinguishes glossophagines from other bird and bat taxa that <b>hover</b> only transiently and use downstroke forces alone to offset body mass (Norberg, 1990).
