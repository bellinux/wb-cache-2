500|$|Roughly {{translated}} from French to English [...] "Zou Bisou Bisou" [...] means [...] "Oh! Kiss Kiss" [...] or [...] "Oh You Kiss Kiss". The Hills version {{is described as}} [...] "[...] [...]typical in style of the international yé-yé movement", which is much like the go-go music genre and was most popular in France, Spain, and Quebec, Mrs. Draper's homeland. The movement's name has phonetic origins, stemming from the exclamation of [...] "Yeah Yeah" [...] in typical fashion during rock and roll music. After translating the song, Haglund claimed that {{the theme of the}} song is about [...] "[...] [...]openly declaring and displaying one's love, coming out from 'the bushes' where 'lovers glide stealthily' and feeling love 'everywhere'". The Huffington Post summarized the song more simply saying that it made the statement [...] "about how kissing is fun". Slate noted that yé-yé singers were often [...] "teenage girls who exuded a faux-innocent sexuality", which played on Megan Draper's [...] "youthful sex appeal and the generation gap between Megan and Don". [...] Paré stated that, [...] "Megan, who is younger and more naïve than Don, was 'unknowingly putting their intimate connection on the line' in front of their friends and co-workers'[...] [...]'The reason that it’s so awkward isn’t that she was <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong,</b> but because it’s private'[...] [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The Berle shows drew {{such high}} ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 {{appearance}} on NBC's Steve Allen Show in New York. Allen, no fan {{of rock and}} roll, introduced a [...] "new Elvis" [...] in a white bow tie and black tails. Presley sang [...] "Hound Dog" [...] {{for less than a}} minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bow tie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, [...] "Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd... set things up so that Presley would show his contrition". Allen, for his part, later wrote that he found Presley's [...] "strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing" [...] and simply worked the singer into the customary [...] "comedy fabric" [...] of his program. Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, [...] "I'm holding down on this show. I don't want to do anything to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so I'm going to go along, but I won't be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance." [...] Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career. Later that night, he appeared on Hy Gardner Calling, a popular local TV show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism to which he was being subjected, Presley responded, [...] "No, I haven't, I don't feel like I'm <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong....</b> I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music.... I mean, how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?" ...|$|E
2500|$|As the Union {{troops were}} rearranging their lines on June 21 in {{preparation}} for their mission against the railroad, they received a surprise visitor, President Abraham Lincoln, who had traveled by water and landed at City Point, Grant's newly established headquarters. He told Grant, [...] "I just thought I would jump aboard a boat and come down and see you. I don't expect I can do any good, and in fact I'm afraid I may do some harm, but I'll just put myself under your orders and if you find me <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> just send me right away." [...] After discussing strategy with Grant, Lincoln visited some of the VI Corps troops who would participate in the upcoming battle.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2014 CIA Director John O. Brennan had to {{apologize}} to lawmakers because five CIA employees (two lawyers and three computer specialists) had surreptitiously searched Senate Intelligence Committee files and reviewed some committee staff members' e-mail on computers {{that were supposed to}} be exclusively for congressional investigators. Brennan ordered the creation of an internal personnel board, led by former senator Evan Bayh, to review the agency employees' conduct and determine [...] "potential disciplinary measures." [...] However, according to some reports, Brennan didn't apologize for spying or <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> at all, even though his agency had been improperly accessing computers of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee (SSCI) and then, in the words of investigative reporter Dan Froomkin, [...] "speaking a lie". This accusation was based on the CIA Director's earlier denials of Senator Dianne Feinstein's claims that the surreptitious CIA search of the SSCI computers occurred, was inappropriate, or [...] "violated the separation of powers principles embodied in the United States Constitution, including the Speech and Debate clause" [...] or other laws.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2008, {{according}} to a US cable released by Wikileaks, King Abdullah had told the US Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, and General David Petraeus to [...] "cut off {{the head of the}} snake". Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to Washington, Adel al-Jubeir, [...] "recalled the King's frequent exhortations to the US to attack Iran" [...] and {{to put an end to}} that country's nuclear program. King Abdullah asserted that Iran was trying to set up Hezbollah-like organizations in African countries, observing that the Iranians didn't think they were <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> and didn't recognize their mistakes. He said that the Iranians [...] "launch missiles with the hope of putting fear in people and the world". The King described his conversation with Iranian foreign minister Mottaki as [...] "a heated exchange, frankly discussing Iran's interference in Arab affairs". When challenged by the King on Iranian meddling in Hamas affairs, Mottaki apparently protested that [...] "these are Muslims". [...] "No, Arabs", countered the King. [...] "You as Persians have no business meddling in Arab matters". King Abdullah said he would favor Rafsanjani in an Iranian election.|$|E
2500|$|Ted Ownby of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture {{stated that}} he {{believes}} producers of shows such as Call of the Wildman [...] "build on preexisting stereotypes, so they don't need to build characters", and added that [...] "people of the South get frustrated at the narrow range of representations [...] ". Dee Davis, president of the Center for Rural Strategies, expressed his concern that the shows approach [...] "the thin line between an honest documentary and exploitative reality show". Animal Planet president Marjorie Kaplan insisted, [...] "We haven't received any negative response at all" [...] to the show. Commenting on {{the potential for the}} show to advance negative stereotypes of Southerners, Animal Planet executive Dawn Sinsel added, [...] "As with all shows that explore a subculture of America that people might not be familiar with, we're careful {{to make sure that we}} represent the talent in their true colors and not 'cover up' their natural character. Turtleman likes to catch all types of animals. We hope Ernie's carefree and loyal personality and love of animals will replace any stereotypes." [...] Brown himself commented [...] "You either like the show and watch it, or you don't. I'm not <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong,</b> just cheering people up." ...|$|E

60|$|The burgomaster {{attempted}} to answer, but the Englishman would scarcely listen. He liked Dave's looks, while he could readily {{see that the}} Norwegian {{was nothing but a}} bully.

6000|$|Dr. Seward {{seemed to}} answer them both in a dreamy kind of way, [...] "I don't know but that I agree with you.

I can't forget how he prayed with almost equal fervor for a cat, {{and then tried to}} tear my throat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count 'lord and master', and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way. That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him, so I suppose he isn't above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand, help to unnerve a man." ...|$|E

If in some hideous dissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow through, you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject. You would not turn a hair. You would not believe that you were <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong.</b> On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the world, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind. What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before. Indeed, to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are accustomed to work at. And, remember, it is the only piece of evidence against me. If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be discovered unless you help me." ...|$|E
