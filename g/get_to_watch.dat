[...] and called 1Nenokkadine a [...] "visually stunning" [...] film. Sridhar Vivan of Bangalore Mirror gave the film 3.5out of five stars: [...] "As the film tries out a refined or reformed revenge saga, {{it needs to be}} seen whether 1 Nenokkadine works at the box office. If it does, it is a good sign for Telugu cinema". A. S. Sashidhar of The Times of India wrote, [...] "The first half of 1: Nenokkadine is good and will keep you wanting for more. The story has a few interesting twists and turns, in the second half too to keep the audience glued to the screen", and Sukumar [...] "should be commended for superb attempt in choosing to make a film that has not been explored in Telugu movies". Shekhar of Oneindia called the film a [...] "brilliant psychological thriller": [...] "The first half of 1: Nenokkadine is excellent and will impress all classes of audience. A few sentimental scenes slow down the pace of narration in the second half. But the superb climax that lasts for 15 minutes will compensate it. The viewers will surely walk out of theatre with contented hearts".|$|E
2500|$|In 1998 Lionel {{was shocked}} to {{discover}} he had fathered a son, 16-year-old Luke Billingham (Greg Freeman) when he himself was 16. Luke debuted as a [...] "shy, inarticulate country boy with an adventurous spirit" [...] who shockingly revealed to Lionel that he was his son. Though Lionel was in shock, he took Luke in, Leigh stated, [...] "Lionel’s struggling {{to get through it}} as fatherhood is thrust upon him. He just inherited a 16-year-old son unlike most people who <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> their kids from a baby and slowly get used to them." [...] The storyline proved to be hugely topical, with the amount of single parent families in the nineties was at an all-time high. Luke instantly got into trouble in his new home, he was involved in a robbery at Lionel's bar, drove Lionel's car without a driver's license and stole a credit card to access online pornography. Despite this, Leigh insisted Lionel was the best possible father, [...] "Lionel’s the best father. He talks through the troubles." [...] After initially struggling to connect with Luke, when he was involved in a dramatic bus crash Lionel realised how much he loved his son and even went to the extent of cooking him gourmet school lunches. After only knowing each other a year, the father-son partnership was broken after Lionel died in scenes that Freeman described as, [...] "draining". Luke soon became a father with his teenage bride, Josie Bergman (Karamia Muller) at age 16, similarly to his father Lionel.|$|E
