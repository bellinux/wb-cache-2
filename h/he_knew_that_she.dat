25|$|Ralph's Wife's Lane is {{the main}} road {{connecting}} Banks with Crossens to the south. Its name has two origins: one that Ralph was a fisherman lost at sea or Ralph was a smuggler, again lost at sea. His wife's ghost {{is supposed to be}} looking for him. It has been reported that people have seen the ghost on dark winter nights walking from by St Stephens Church to Fiddler's Ferry holding a lamp waiting for her loved one to return home. The story states that she lit a lamp in her window every night and sat by it so <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was waiting for him to return home. The site of the house is occupied by two bungalows.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{ambiguous}} {{terms are}} interpreted {{in favor of}} finding coverage, Cosby prevailed. O'Connell gave a second independent reason for finding in Cosby's favor. She looked at the Dickinson complaint and concluded that there are allegations independent of sexual misconduct. [...] "For example, allegations that Defendant 'intentionally drugged' Dickinson 'even though <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{had been in a}} rehab center for addiction a few months before' could reasonably be interpreted as independent of sexual misconduct, and therefore, within the Policies' coverage ... Similarly, the Dickinson Complaint alleges that Defendant's statements contain numerous implications about Dickinson, including the implication that 'Dickinson has copied the claims made publicly by other women against Defendant' and 'the implication that Ms. Dickinson's rape disclosure is a lie and that therefore she is a liar'", she wrote. As courts impose coverage in a [...] "mixed" [...] action, Cosby prevailed here as well but this ruling does not apply to the Massachusetts case, where AIG and Cosby are still fighting to determine who is liable. AIG plans to appeal this ruling.|$|E
