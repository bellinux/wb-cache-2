40|$|This study {{examines}} the groundwater controversy in U. S. -Mexican {{relations and the}} role domestic political structures are likely to play in shaping a bilateral agreement apportioning transboundary groundwater. The study shows that waterpolicy making in the United States takes a distributive form while policy making in Mexico resembles a mobilization style of policy formation. It is argued that these dissimilar national water policy systems affect the way both nations engage the other in bilateral water disputes and are relvant to ascertaining the prospects for resolving the groundwater controversy. The study surveys the relevant hydrological, historical and economic context bearing on the groundwater dispute, then examines the moles of domestic policy making in each country. It follows with an analysis of how national differences in policy making are witnessed in previous bilateral water conflicts. Water policy patterns pertaining to the United States and Mexico respectively strongly influence the making of foreing policy in this sogere. Domestic policy making affects the manner of politization, objectives sought by each nation, and the diplomatic style seen in the adjustment of bilateral water agreements. Patterns seen in previous water conflicts, it is suggested, may obtain in the groundwater case. Nevertheless, the groundwater controversy is substantially different from earlier surface water <b>disputs.</b> Hydrological variation between problem situations is apt to fragment political interests in the United States. Nor is there a firm basis for approaching a settlement in international law. These conditions frustrate extrapolation of past political patterns to the groundwater situation. The study concludes analyzing various methods for resolving the groundwater conflict in light of political limitations. Of these alternatives, a case by case, ad hoc approach to settling the groundwater conflict is indicated as the most feasible approach. Attainment of a fully comprehensive groundwater treaty as now envisioned by the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), {{is not likely to}} be achieved. However, formal comprehensiveness can be had by conferring on IBWC comprehensive authority to seek case by case solutions...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{strategic}} municipal traffic planning involved specialist consultants need {{to evaluate the}} effects of traffic measures, which serves {{as the basis for}} decision making by participating parties when it comes to implementation. The downside to popular traffic demand models is that they only represent the impacts of structural and operational measures in the fields of road traffic and public transport. But the arrangements of supply-side measures, as e. g. bike and pedestrian traffic, consultant and informational measures, cannot be sufficiently modelled with that technique. Furthermore they only represent the impact of different measures in total and at a particular time. It is not possible - or only with huge efforts - to inference on the impact of single measures and to picture time-dependent changes. Additionally responsible consultants need not only work on technical tasks, but also support the planning process including the understandable presentation of the technical results to avoid misunderstandings and <b>disputs</b> between involved parties. Otherwise planning problems, delays in the progress and a widespread failure may be likely consequences. Within the scope of this research project one aim is to explore the potentials of system-dynamic modells to reduce the shown deficits that can be caused by the use of popular traffic demand models. An additional aim is to represent technical results in an understandable form. Based on a system dynamic model, the "Sensitivitätsmodell", a model of urban traffic is developed and as an example used to evaluate the impacts of municipal traffic strategies. The results of these modelled simulations are appraised with regard to possible statements and applications. Furthermore results of the Sensitivitätsmodell are compared with results of the strategic traffic planning process in the city of Düsseldorf found out by a traffic demand model, and strengths and weaknesses are disussed. A written survey adressing the "method and process {{of strategic}} municipal traffic planning" is conducted following the model-application and the comparison of both models. The results of this survey are evaluated and presented with a focus on the implementation of strategic traffic planning processes, its used instruments for traffic analysis and the design of participation procedures. Based on these results, requirements and potentials for the application of the Sensitivitätsmodell are derived and complimented by interviews with traffic planning experts. The results of the working steps clearly demonstrate the potentials of system dynamic models, e. g. the Sensitivitätsmodell, in the course of longterm municipal traffic planning. The application of the model is able to supplement and enrich the planning process. The specific benefit of this modell is shown when answering questions of how to identify and assess relevant cause-effect impacts in urban and traffic planning with relative marginal expenses. Based on the simulations the range of effectiveness of different combinations of measures can be rated qualitatively. Also the model allows an analysis of dynamic changes to evaluate the impacts of measures that are not representable using traffic demand models. Concerning this matter further research is needed regarding the consolidation, editing and presentation of technical results to build a decision basis for the traffic policy. Furthermore an additional benefit within the scope of the participation process is its ability to comprehensibly demonstrate traffic impacts and cause-effect impacts. The use of the model does not serve in the specific planning of any measures but rather in the preparation of higher-order, long-term guidelines and objectives and generates a reasonable extension of popular planning instruments. Questions regarding the integration and establishment of system dynamic models like the Sensitivitätsmodell as an additional instrument to strategic municipal traffic planning processes and the neccessary temporal, personal and financial expenses are not dealt with in detail by this research. In general it seems neccessary for a "successful" use of the model to perceive and accept the model as a step to formulate the mission statement and the planning objectives by all parties and evaluate the impacts of municipal traffic strategies qualitatively. This requires a high participation by municipal policy-makers as the development and use of the modell is essential to ensure a high acceptance {{of the results of the}} model and derived objectives and strategies...|$|R
