50|$|The basic setup in electrosynthesis is a {{galvanic}} cell, a potentiostat and two electrodes. Good electrosynthetic conditions use {{a solvent}} and electrolyte combination that minimizes electrical resistance. Protic conditions often use alcohol-water or dioxane-water solvent mixtures with an electrolyte {{such as a}} soluble salt, acid or base. Aprotic conditions often use an organic solvent such as acetonitrile or dichloromethane with electrolytes such as lithium perchlorate or tetrabutylammonium acetate. Electrodes are selected which provide favorable electron transfer properties towards the substrate while maximizing the activation energy for side reactions. This activation energy is often related to an overpotential of a competing reaction. For example, in aqueous conditions the competing reactions in the cell are the formation of oxygen at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode. In this case a graphite anode and lead cathode could be used effectively because of their high overpotentials for oxygen and hydrogen formation respectively. Many other materials {{can be used as}} electrodes. Other examples include platinum, magnesium, mercury (as a liquid pool in the reactor), stainless steel or reticulated vitreous carbon. Some reactions use a sacrificial electrode which is consumed during the reaction like zinc or lead. The two basic cell types are undivided cell or <b>divided</b> <b>cell</b> type. In divided cells the cathode and anode chambers are separated with a semiporous membrane. Common membrane materials include sintered glass, porous porcelain, polytetrafluoroethene or polypropylene. The purpose of the <b>divided</b> <b>cell</b> is to permit the diffusion of ions while restricting the flow of the products and reactants. This is important when unwanted side reactions are possible. An example of a reaction requiring a <b>divided</b> <b>cell</b> is the reduction of nitrobenzene to phenylhydroxylamine, where the latter chemical is susceptible to oxidation at the anode.|$|E

In nonstroke rats, 55 % of <b>dividing</b> <b>cells</b> were oriented horizontally, whereas 40 % were oriented vertically. Horizontal and vertical cleavage orientations produce asymmetric and symmetric divisions, respectively. Four days after stroke, the number of <b>dividing</b> <b>cells</b> increased twofold, whereas the proportion of symmetric <b>dividing</b> <b>cells</b> significantly (p � 0. 01) increased from 40 % before stroke to 60 %. Fourteen days after stroke, the percentage of symmetric <b>dividing</b> <b>cells</b> was 47 %. Stroke-increased numbers of <b>dividing</b> <b>cells</b> in M-phase were confirmed by immuostaining. In nonstroke rats, 37 and 33 % of symmetric and asymmetric <b>dividing</b> <b>cells,</b> respectively, exhibited a neuronal marker (TuJ 1). Four days after stroke, rats exhibited a significant (p � 0. 05) augmentation of the frequency (47 %) of neuronal distribution showing TuJ 1 immunoreactivity in cells with symmetric division but not cells with asymmetric division (33 %). Numb immunoreactivity was detected in SVZ cells of nonstroke rats. Stroke did not change Numb distribution. Our data suggest that neurons are produced by both asymmetric and symmetric cell divisions in the adult SVZ, and the transient increases in symmetric division and neuronal differentiation may result in stroke-induced neurogenesis.

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{mechanisms}} by which passing a current through the electrochemical cell can encourage pollutant desorption.

40|$|During prion diseases, a {{normally}} benign, host protein, denoted PrP C, undergoes alternative folding {{into the}} aberrant isoform, PrP Sc. We used ELISA {{to identify and}} confirm hits {{in order to develop}} leads that reduce PrP Sc in prion-infected dividing and stationary-phase mouse neuroblastoma (ScN 2 a-cl 3) cells. We tested 52, 830 diverse small molecules in <b>dividing</b> <b>cells</b> and 49, 430 in stationary-phase cells.

25|$|Given these {{properties}} of DNA damage and mutation, {{it can be}} seen that DNA damages are a special problem in non-dividing or slowly <b>dividing</b> <b>cells,</b> where unrepaired damages will tend to accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly <b>dividing</b> <b>cells,</b> unrepaired DNA damages that do not kill the cell by blocking replication will tend to cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell’s survival. Thus, in a population of cells comprising a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells will tend to be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will tend to clonally expand at the expense of neighboring cells in the tissue. This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism, because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer. Thus DNA damages in frequently <b>dividing</b> <b>cells,</b> because they give rise to mutations, are a prominent cause of cancer. In contrast, DNA damages in infrequently <b>dividing</b> <b>cells</b> are likely a prominent cause of aging.|$|R

40|$|Background The {{characterisation}} of <b>dividing</b> brain <b>cells</b> {{is fundamental}} for studies ranging from developmental and stem cell biology, to brain cancers. Whilst there is extensive anatomical data on these <b>dividing</b> <b>cells,</b> limited gene transcription data is available due to technical constraints. New method We focally isolated <b>dividing</b> <b>cells</b> whilst conserving RNA, from culture, primary neural tissue and xenografted glioma tumours, using a thymidine analogue that enables gene transcription analysis. Results 5 -ethynyl- 2 -deoxyuridine labels the replicating DNA of <b>dividing</b> <b>cells.</b> Once labelled, cultured cells and tissues were dissociated, fluorescently tagged with a revised click chemistry technique and the <b>dividing</b> <b>cells</b> isolated using fluorescence-assisted cell sorting. RNA was extracted and analysed using real time PCR. Proliferation and maturation related gene expression in neurogenic tissues was demonstrated in acutely and 3 day old labelled cells, respectively. An elevated expression of marker and pathway genes was {{demonstrated in the}} <b>dividing</b> <b>cells</b> of xenografted brain tumours, with the non-dividing cells showing relatively low levels of expression. Comparison with existing method BrdU “immune-labelling”, {{the most frequently used}} protocol for detecting cell proliferation, causes complete denaturation of RNA, precluding gene transcription analysis. This EdU labelling technique, maintained cell integrity during dissociation, minimized copper exposure during labelling and used a cell isolation protocol that avoided cell lysis, thus conserving RNA. Conclusions The technique conserves RNA, enabling the definition of cell proliferation-related changes in gene transcription of neural and pathological brain cells in cells harvested immediately after division, or following a period of maturation.

40|$|Abstract. Spatial {{control of}} {{cytokinesis}} in plant cells depends on {{guidance of the}} cytokinetic apparatus, the phragmoplast, to a cortical “division site ” established before mitosis.

Here, we show that the Tan 1 gene is expressed in <b>dividing</b> <b>cells</b> and encodes a highly basic protein that can directly bind to microtubules (MTs). Moreover, proteins recognized by anti-TAN 1 antibodies are preferentially associated with the MT-containing cytoskeletal structures that are misoriented in <b>dividing</b> <b>cells</b> of tan 1 mutants.
