5|$|The {{first volume}} of Beebe's {{pheasant}} monograph was published that fall, although the ongoing war made it unclear when the remaining three volumes would be published. The first volume was highly praised by reviewers, and received the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1918. In January 1919 Roosevelt, who was severely ill by this point, wrote to Beebe from <b>his</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>bed</b> congratulating Beebe on {{the publication of his}} monograph. His letter of congratulation to Beebe was the last letter that Roosevelt wrote before his death. Volume II of the monograph was published in 1921, and volumes III and IV were published in 1922. The completed work, titled A Monograph of the Pheasants, has been considered by some reviewers to be possibly the greatest ornithological monograph of the twentieth century.|$|E

She initially resists {{as she is}} {{still in love with}} Oliver, but learns to her disappointment that he does not reciprocate her feelings.

Mother and daughter move in with Marco, prompting a jealous Oliver to file for sole custody of Chloe, though he later rescinds this decision. Marco proposes to Carmella and she accepts, however later that day he is severely injured in a bushfire. Carmella marries him from <b>his</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>bed,</b> and Marco dies shortly afterwards. Following his death, Carmella believes she is haunted by Marco's spirit. Oliver moves to New York, but she declines his invitation to accompany him. He later moves to Portugal, and in December 2008, Carmella and Chloe leave to be with him. They briefly return to Erinsborough when Oliver's mother Rebecca (Jane Hall) breaks up with her husband Paul (Stefan Dennis), to convince her to come and live with them.|$|E

Jericho's powers become more potent, but Tanner realises that as it is all in his mind, he can play by the same rules, and he ultimately defeats his mental projection of Jericho. In a mental visualisation of a police interrogation room, Tanner begins questioning Jericho and figures that the news reports from the television in <b>his</b> real-world <b>hospital</b> <b>bed</b> are feeding <b>his</b> coma dream. From this he knows of a real-world bomb plot, but deduces that it is not real - Jericho is a gangster, not a terrorist.|$|R

Skinner stumbles in pain, and in an elevator, Krycek reveals himself to Skinner and explains {{that he has a}} vaccine which could save Mulder's life. However, he will only give it if Skinner can ensure that Scully does not give birth to her baby for reasons that he does not disclose. Later, alone in <b>his</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>bed,</b> Miles regains consciousness and goes to take a shower. While doing so, his decaying flesh falls away, revealing a healthy body beneath. He tries to persuade Scully and Doggett that the aliens who abducted him are trying to save humanity. Scully, however, gets a lab report which reveals that Miles's DNA has substantially changed; he is now a new being. Skinner later tells Scully that there is a cure for Mulder's disease, but does not explain Krycek's demands.|$|E

40|$|In Europe, the {{reduction}} of acute care <b>hospital</b> <b>beds</b> {{has been one of}} the measures implemented to restrict hospital expenditure. The aim of this study is to gain insight into the effect bed reductions have on the use of the remaining beds within different healthcare systems. We concentrated on two healthcare system elements: hospital financing system (per diem and global budget systems) and physician remuneration system (fee-for-service and salary systems). We also controlled for technological development and demand for healthcare. We used data from the OECD health data files of 10 North-Western European countries on <b>hospital</b> <b>bed</b> supply and use. The <b>hospital</b> <b>bed</b> indicators used were occupancy rate, average length of stay and admission rate. The data were analysed with multilevel analysis.

However, we found significant effects only for the <b>hospital</b> <b>bed</b> use indicators "occupancy rate" and "admission rate". For physician financing systems, no significant effects were found.

25|$|Despite his {{physical}} injuries, Hughes was proud that {{his mind was}} still working. As he lay in <b>his</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>bed,</b> {{he decided that he}} did not like the bed's design. He called in plant engineers to design a customized bed, equipped with hot and cold running water, built in six sections, and operated by 30 electric motors, with push-button adjustments. The hospital bed was designed by Hughes specifically to alleviate the pain caused by moving with severe burn injuries. Despite the fact that he never had the chance to use the bed that he designed, Hughes' bed served as a prototype for the modern hospital bed. Hughes' doctors considered his recovery almost miraculous. Hughes, however, believed that neither miracle nor modern medicine contributed to his recovery, instead asserting the natural life-giving properties of fresh-squeezed orange juice were responsible.|$|E

25|$|In December 1931, Salisbury was {{the site}} of a lynching of a black man. Members of a 300-man white mob dragged Matthew Williams, accused of murdering his white {{employer}} and wounded while being captured, from <b>his</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>bed.</b> They threw Williams from a third-floor window to the crowd below, where he was stabbed, tied to a truck and dragged three blocks to the county court house. There they hanged him from a tree, before he had any chance of a trial. The mob paraded his body through the black part of Salisbury for intimidation, and mutilated and burned him. It was the 32nd lynching in Maryland since 1882. No one was prosecuted for Williams' murder, as was typical in lynchings. As of 2007, there was no commemoration of the extrajudicial murder. The Equal Justice Initiative, based in Montgomery, Alabama, published an updated compilation of lynchings in 2015. Director Bryan Stephenson is leading the effort to establish a museum and memorial to these crimes, and encourages counties to establish their own memorials. He believes that the history of slavery and lynchings has influenced the continued over-incarceration of blacks and punitive sentencing.|$|E
