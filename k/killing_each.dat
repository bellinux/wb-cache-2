5|$|By 6:30a.m. {{the battle}} for the Alamo was over. Mexican {{soldiers}} inspected each corpse, bayoneting any body that moved. Even with all of the Texians dead, Mexican soldiers continued to shoot, some <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> other in the confusion. Mexican generals were unable to stop the bloodlust and appealed to Santa Anna for help. Although the general showed himself, the violence continued and the buglers were finally ordered to sound a retreat. For 15minutes after that, soldiers continued to fire into dead bodies.|$|E
5|$|Howard Stark (portrayed by Dominic Cooper) is {{a weapons}} {{developer}} who is framed for selling weapons to America's enemies. One {{of the weapons}} he created during the war was Midnight Oil, designed to give soldiers extra stamina during war, but instead it caused psychosis and led to them <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> other. The U.S. military stole Midnight Oil and used it on the Russians, and Fennhoff blames Stark for the ensuing massacre. Fennhoff hypnotises Stark into bombing New York, but Carter is able to convince Stark to stop. He moves on to set up his own film studio in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Koushun Takami {{completed}} Battle Royale when {{he stopped}} working as a journalist in 1996. The story was rejected {{in the final round}} of the 1997 , which took place in March 1998, because of its controversial content. Masao Higashi, {{who took part in the}} award's preliminary selection committee, later suspected this was due to its backdrop of students <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> other being too reminiscent of the Kobe child murders committed the previous year. Battle Royale was first published in April 1999 by Ohta Publishing. In August 2002, it was released in a revised, two-part pocket edition by Gentosha.|$|E

5|$|Meat ants {{are highly}} {{territorial}} and aggressive ants which establish firm borders between neighbouring colonies. While the boundaries are not physical, worker ants maintain them {{by engaging in}} ritualised fighting with opponent ants, an interaction most colonies engage in. Fatalities are rare on both sides, but fights may cause injuries to several workers. This fighting enables territory to be contested between opposing colonies without them <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> other and costing many casualties on both sides. Due of this, it is a method of avoiding casualties and promotes intercolony communication and assessment. A drainage {{of the work force}} would occur if these boundaries acted as a conflict zone if ritualised fighting did not take place. Lethal fighting only occurs if the colony is under attack.|$|E
5|$|The Heirs of Fate saga, {{released}} after {{the rest of}} the DLC, focuses around the game's Child units. Two separate versions of the Avatar's child Kana, one male and one female, each journey with members of each version's cast to discover why a group of mysterious soldiers attacked their homes. It is revealed that they were never truly in their homes, as Anankos had transported them to Valla and attempted to trick them into <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> other. However, Azura's son, Shigure, broke the illusion and banded the two Kanas' armies together, only to leave them to face Anankos alone with the hidden verse of his mother's song. However, the army finds a way back, and helps to take down Anankos for one final time.|$|E

Quatermass and Roney find him there, and he describes visions of the insect aliens <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> other. As Quatermass investigates {{the history of the}} area, he finds accounts dating back to medieval times about devils and ghosts, all centred on incidents where the ground was disturbed. He suspects a psychic projection of these beings has remained on the alien ship and is being seen by those who come into contact with it.|$|E

5000|$|The {{incidence}} of honor killings {{is very difficult}} to determine and estimates vary widely. In most countries data on honor killings is not collected systematically, and many of these killings are reported by the families as suicides or accidents and registered as such. Although honor killings are often associated with the Asian continent, especially the Middle East and South Asia, they occur all over the world. In 2000, the United Nations estimated that 5,000 women were victims of honor <b>killings</b> <b>each</b> year. According to BBC, [...] "Women's advocacy groups, however, suspect that more than 20,000 women are killed worldwide each year." [...] Murder is not the only form of honor crime, other crimes such as acid attacks, abduction, mutilations, beatings occur; in 2010 the UK police recorded at least 2,823 such crimes.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} game mechanics, the Spirits of Rage are, technically, self-upgrading spells. Each spirit {{possesses}} four different abilities (spells), becomes more powerful or {{less expensive to}} call upon as it grows more experienced, and receives experience from <b>killing</b> enemies. <b>Each</b> spirit gains experience independently, and each ability is upgraded separately.|$|R
5|$|Soon, {{they find}} the espers and Terra convinces them to accept a truce with Gestahl. However, during the negotiations, Kefka attacks the espers, <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> of those still alive and {{capturing}} the magicite that remains from their essence. Additionally, he kills General Leo, who is appalled by Kefka's dishonorable tactics and attempts to defend the espers. The Returners reunite, now aware that the peace was a ploy for Gestahl to obtain magicite and the stone statue remains of the Warring Triad within the espers' now-unsealed land. Kefka and Gestahl travel through the open gate to the esper world, find the Warring Triad, and prompt the island on which the esper world is located to detach and fly in the sky as an ominous Floating Continent. The Returners attempt {{to stop them from}} causing further damage, but despite their efforts, they are unable to prevent Kefka and Gestahl from gaining the power of the statues. Now empowered, Kefka promptly kills Gestahl and moves the statues out of their proper alignment, upsetting the balance of magical power and causing the destruction of most of the surface world. In the disaster, the Returners are separated from one another as Setzer's airship is torn apart.|$|E

25|$|The popular British {{comic strip}} Charley's War by Pat Mills which was {{published}} in Battle Picture Weekly 1979-1985 and portrayed the experiences of young British soldier Charley Bourne in the trenches of the Great War. The strip included a sequence of episodes in which the story's hero Charley and his unit are stationed opposite the regiment of young Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler in December 1917. Charley and Hitler fight hand-to-hand in one scene, nearly <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> other. Hitler is portrayed as a somewhat eccentric and scruffy soldier, ill-tempered but brave, albeit selfishly so.|$|E
5000|$|... killing sprees: Killing 5, 10, 15, 20 or 25 combatants without dying {{is called}} a <b>killing</b> spree, <b>each</b> greater kill count being {{considered}} more valuable and having a unique title (respectively; Killing Spree, Rampage, Dominating, Unstoppable, Godlike). The game tracked how many times has the player achieved each of these titles.|$|R
50|$|The game's main theme—gods <b>killing</b> off <b>each</b> other’s {{believers in}} {{religious}} warfare—has caused some controversy. The game comes with six pawns, including ones depicting Jesus swinging a cross {{as a weapon}} and the Buddha firing a machine gun. Several stores have refused to carry the game because of its potential to offend religious people.|$|R

25|$|Isabella {{lived to}} see what was {{essentially}} two of her family's enemies <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> other off. Her family's executioner James I of Scotland died a violent death in February 1437, in a failed coup by his kinsman and former ally Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl. Walter Stewart, who had himself conspired with James against Isabella's dead husband, Murdoch Duke of Albany, also suffered a gruesome end soon afterwards. He and his co-conspirators against the King were attainted and put to death in Edinburgh by a series of tortures.|$|E
25|$|Famous poets, such as Fazyl bin Tahir Enderuni, wrote poems, and {{classical}} composers, {{such as the}} court musician Hammamizade İsmail Dede Efendi (1778–1846), composed köçekces for celebrated köçeks. Many Istanbul meyhanes (nighttime taverns serving meze, raki or wine) hired köçeks. Before starting their performance, the köçek danced among the spectators, {{to make them more}} excited. In the audience, competition for their attention often caused commotions and altercations. Men would go wild, breaking their glasses, shouting themselves voiceless, or fighting and sometimes <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> other vying for the boys' sexual favors. This resulted in suppression of the practice under Sultan Abd-ul-Mejid I.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographical}} formations of {{the region}} are frequently mentioned in local folklore. According to legend, Tomorr personified a giant who fought his brother Shpirag, personified by a nearby mountain, {{for the love of}} a young woman. The two brothers fought bitterly for her affections and ended up <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> other. Deep in sorrow, the legend states, the grieving woman for whom they had contested wept over their deaths; her tears created the Osum river. She was then said to have turned to stone, becoming the foundation on which Berat Castle is now built. Both Tomorr and Shpirag are visible from the city of Berat.|$|E
50|$|Some {{mandatory}} missions represent important events. Between {{these the}} player must take enough nearby territories in skirmish battles, {{variations on the}} theme of building a base and <b>killing</b> everyone. <b>Each</b> territory provides a permanent increase of power points, the unit limit, and/or a multiplier for acquired resources. Units, their upgrades and purchased powers also persist between battles.|$|R

25|$|Cougars {{generally}} {{give the}} bears a wide berth. Grizzlies have less competition with cougars than with other predators, such as coyotes, wolves, and other bears. When a grizzly descends on a cougar feeding on its kill, the cougar usually {{gives way to}} the bear. When a cougar does stand its ground, it will use its superior agility and its claws to harass the bear, yet stay out of its reach until one of them gives up. Grizzly bears occasionally kill cougars in disputes over kills. There have been several accounts, primarily from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, of cougars and grizzly bears <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> other in fights to the death.|$|E
25|$|The monsters of {{the week}} in the series, Ghosts are twisted aberrations born from the regrets or {{suffering}} {{of people who have}} died and become lost in limbo. Panty and Stocking are tasked with their destruction, which allows them to pass on to Heaven, leaving behind Heaven Coins. Although most Ghosts are savage or destructive, some are relatively harmless annoyances or even oppose their true nature and try to live peacefully. Ghosts are usually slain with angelic weapons, but there are other means of destroying them, such as Ghosts <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> other or peacefully accomplishing what they wanted to achieve in life. As a recurring joke, whenever Panty and Stocking defeat a Ghost with their angelic weapons, a paper-mache model of the Ghost is filmed being blown-up.|$|E

2500|$|The actual shootings {{were done}} by three units, one of Germans, another of Latvian SD men, and another {{unit of the}} Latvia police, {{apparently}} the one commanded by Galiņš. The victims were positioned {{along the edge of}} the sea side of the trench. They were faced away from their killers, who fired across the trench, with two gunman allocated to each victim. After the initial volley, a German SD man would step down into trench, inspect the bodies, and fire finishing shots into anyone left alive. The goal was to have the bodies fall into the trench, but this did not always happen. Accordingly, the executioners had a [...] "kicker" [...] come along after each group of victims. The kicker's job was to literally to kick, roll, or shove the bodies into the grave. Sergeant Jauģietis of the Latvia police worked as a kicker for at least part of the <b>killings.</b> <b>Each</b> execution team was relieved by another after killing 10 sets of victims.|$|R

500|$|In {{his search}} for the Black Hand, Talion allies himself with Hirgon, a ranger deserter who leads a {{community}} of Gondorian outcasts choosing to settle in Mordor, and Ratbag the Coward (Phil LaMarr), an Orc who offers to bring Talion closer to the Black Hand {{in exchange for his}} assistance in climbing Mordor's military hierarchy. Talion helps Ratbag ascend the ranks to the level of warchief by <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> of his immediate superiors, finally becoming Warchief himself. Talion then goes after the other Warchiefs in Udun, weakening Sauron's forces in that area. Soon enough, Hirgon has a plan to draw out the Black Captains. Using acquired grog and blasting powder, Talion helps the Outcasts destroy a statue dedicated to Sauron. Instead of the Black Hand answering the [...] "message", the Hammer of Sauron is sent, punishing Ratbag for not answering his duties to kill the ranger. Talion and The Hammer then face off, with packs of Uruk joining the fight, but after a savage battle, Talion manages to kill The Hammer.|$|E
50|$|Cockney comedian Syd Walker {{plays it}} {{more or less}} {{straight}} as Scotland Yard Detective Inspector Davidson, at present trying to determine who murdered the much-hated Count Mattoni (Leslie Perrins).

25|$|The main flaw {{associated}} with delivering gas via artillery was {{the difficulty of}} achieving a <b>killing</b> concentration. <b>Each</b> shell had a small gas payload and an area {{would have to be}} subjected to a saturation bombardment to produce a cloud to match cylinder delivery. Mustard gas, however, did not need to form a concentrated cloud and hence artillery was the ideal vehicle for delivery of this battlefield pollutant.|$|R
25|$|Investigators {{trying to}} find out who was {{responsible}} for the <b>killings</b> examined <b>each</b> armoured car's guns and ammunition, but the guns had been cleaned and ammunition replenished.
