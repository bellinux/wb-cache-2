5|$|In 1827, the British {{botanist}} Robert Brown {{observed that}} dust particles inside pollen grains floating in water constantly jiggled about <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>reason.</b> In 1905, Albert Einstein theorized that this Brownian motion {{was caused by}} the water molecules continuously knocking the grains about, and developed a hypothetical mathematical model to describe it. This model was validated experimentally in 1908 by French physicist Jean Perrin, thus providing additional validation for particle theory (and by extension atomic theory).|$|E
5|$|Killer whales {{have also}} been {{observed}} preying on terrestrial mammals, such as deer swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America. Killer whale cannibalism has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but {{this is likely to}} be the result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers. One killer whale was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident killer whales have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|E
5|$|Thrasher and Blastus are {{two teenage}} robots {{who live on}} the planet of Insanus. Their planet is {{inhabited}} by murderous robots who seek to kill one another <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>reason.</b> Slightly less horrific than their peers, the duo seek to make it through high school, and navigate their lives with mixed results. Thrasher (Patton Oswalt), a tall and lanky robot, wishes to gain the affections of an attractive female robot named Maimy (Jessie Cantrell). Meanwhile, Blastus (John Gemberling), a small and rotund robot, just wants to be popular. As with Blastus, unlike most robots on Insanus, he is mostly sensitive and non-criminal, much to the disapproval of his mother. In his quest to be cool, however, he is incredibly impulsive and overconfident in his abilities. Thrasher, though calm and reserved, often falls prey to Blastus' badly-thought out plans.|$|E

5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>reason.</b> It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Andy grows {{determined}} {{to escape from}} Shawshank, and informs Red {{that he is going}} to Zihuatanejo in Mexico, telling him that if he should ever get out of prison, he should go to a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, and there will be a volcanic rock, and a gift for him under it. During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In a fury, Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of David Cassidy on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing a hole through Cassidy's rectum. Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of Friends, allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a parole board and complains that the concept of rehabilitation is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>reason,</b> Red is put on parole anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in Zihuatanejo, eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red never does.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|E

50|$|Bali Rai’s (un)arranged {{marriage}} is commonly seen by critics as worth reading {{because of the}} issue the novel deals with. What the author can be criticized for is the language he uses. Some critics consider the novel being classified as young adult novel and its easy, colloquial writing style makes it accessible. But {{on the other hand}} one might argue that the use of different accents throughout the novel gets annoying, especially when they are used <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>reasons</b> and critics think that the writing is not the memorable about the novel.The widely held opinion about the story itself is that it deals with an important affair. The book helps to show the topicality of arranged marriages, which are even in the 21st century an often occurring phenomenon and spread around the whole world.|$|R
25|$|An {{object in}} motion that {{moves out of}} its natural arc <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>reason</b> will appear erratic rather than fluid.

Traditional animators tend to draw the arc in lightly on the paper for reference, to be erased later.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms are not {{necessarily}} distinguishable from other kinds of distress.

A high rate of dogs with GDV have cardiac arrhythmias (40 percent in one study). Chronic GDV may occur in dogs, symptoms of which include loss of appetite, vomiting and weight loss.|$|E

25|$|Batzaria's Haplea {{was a major}} {{contribution}} to Romanian comics culture and interwar Romanian humor, and is ranked by comics historiographer Dodo Niță as the top Romanian series of all times. The comics, the books and the animated film all ridicule the boorish manners of peasants, and add comic effect to the clash of cultures between city and village lives. The scripts were not entirely original creations: according to translator and critic Adrian Solomon, one Haplea episode retold a grotesque theme with some tradition in the Romanian folklore (the story of Păcală), that in which the protagonist murders people <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>reason.</b> Another influence on Haplea, as noted by Batzaria reviewers, was the 19th-century fabulist and shorty author Anton Pann.|$|E
60|$|It {{was even}} less consoling to glance astern, for the surf that sweeps the fever coast was evidently rather worse than usual that day, {{as it is}} now and then <b>for</b> <b>no</b> very <b>apparent</b> <b>reason.</b> The ridges had become walls, with great {{frothing}} crests and sides that were smeared with spumy lines.

60|$|She, on her part, {{noticed the}} weariness in his eyes, {{and found it}} {{necessary}} to remind herself of his offences, for the story he told was not without its effect on her.

25|$|The puritanical pastor leads {{confirmation}} {{classes and}} gives his pubescent children a guilty conscience over apparently small transgressions. He has them wear white ribbons {{as a reminder}} of the innocence and purity from which they have strayed. When under interrogation his son confesses to impure touching, the pastor has the boy’s hands tied to his bed frame each night. The doctor, a widower, treats the village children kindly but humiliates his housekeeper (the local midwife, with whom he is having sexual relations) and also sexually abuses his teenage daughter. The baron, who is the lord of the manor, underwrites harvest festivities for the villagers, many of them his farm workers. After his young son is abusively injured by unknown assailant(s), he summarily dismisses Eva <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>reason,</b> yet defends the integrity of a farmer whose son in a symbolic act has destroyed the baron's field of cabbages.|$|E
25|$|His wife {{contracted}} tuberculosis {{while in}} Australia, leaving her bedridden for years {{until her death}} in September 9, 1931.

One afternoon, around 1936, Girault started shouting at their neighbours for hours <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>reason.</b> This continued on into the night until someone finally called the police who took him away. Two days later, his sons, Ernest and Frank, drove him to an insane asylum in Goodna, Queensland. He was admitted several more times into the asylum.

His cause of death was officially listed as paraphrenia and exhaustion. He was buried at Dunwich and now lies in an unmarked grave.|$|E
60|$|Barbara said nothing, {{though she}} was {{sensible}} of a curious little thrill. She had not seen Brooke since the evening he had behaved in what was an apparently inexplicable fashion at the ranch, and had heard very little about him. She, however, watched the wharf intently, until she saw Devine accost {{a man with a}} bronzed face who was quietly threading his way through the hurrying groups, and her heart beat a trifle faster than usual as they moved together towards the steamer. Then almost unconsciously she turned to see if the woman they had been discussing was also watching for him, but she had by this time disappeared. Barbara, <b>for</b> <b>no</b> very <b>apparent</b> <b>reason,</b> felt a trifle pleased at this.|$|R
60|$|Austin had swung {{through a}} waltz with Jacinta, though the guitars were still twinging softly when they climbed {{the ladder to}} the bridge-deck, where canvas chairs were laid out. It was a curious waltz, tinged with the melancholy there is in most Spanish music, but the crash of a gun broke through it, and while the roar of a whistle drowned the drowsy murmur of the surf, the long black hull of an African {{mailboat}} slid into the harbour ringed with lights. Then there followed the rattle of cable, and Austin fancied that {{the sight of the}} steamer had, <b>for</b> <b>no</b> very <b>apparent</b> <b>reason,</b> its effect upon his companion. She had been cordial during the evening, but there was a faint suggestion of hardness in her face as she turned to him.|$|R
50|$|Finlay was {{appointed}} to the High Court in 1924 and assigned to the King's Bench Division. The appointment caused further controversy, as his father was still judicially active. The Law Times remarked that:"Sir William Finlay must be accounted as a singularly fortunate man … after but 23 years at the Bar, <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>apparent</b> professional <b>reason,</b> he is passed over the heads of those who have undoubted prior claims for consideration and whose appointment would have strengthened the King's Bench."In 1925, he presided over the controversial trial of Norman Thorne. The same year, he chaired a committee on legal aid reform, which reported in 1926 and 1928. Upon {{the death of his father}} in 1929 he succeeded to him as Viscount Finlay. In 1938 he was made a Lord Justice of Appeal and sworn in the Privy Council.|$|R
