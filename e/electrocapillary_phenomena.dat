5000|$|Electrocapillarity or <b>electrocapillary</b> <b>{{phenomena}}</b> are {{the phenomena}} related {{to changes in}} the surface energy (or interfacial tension) of the dropping mercury electrode (DME) as the electrode potential changes or the electrolytic solution composition and concentration change. The term [...] "electro-capillary" [...] is used to describe the change in mercury (Hg) electrode potential {{as a function of the}} change in the surface or interfacial tension of the Hg determined by the capillary rise method. The phenomena are the historic main contributions for understanding and validating the models of the structure of the electrical double layer. The phenomena are related to the electrokinetic phenomena and consequently to the colloid chemistry.|$|E
40|$|<b>Electrocapillary</b> <b>{{phenomena}}</b> are phenomena {{associated with}} the variation of the interfacial tension at the metal-electrolyte boundary caused by the change of the electric (electrode) potential of metal. These phenomena include the motion of metal-electrolyte interface driven by the electrically-induced gradient of the interfacial tension...|$|E
40|$|In the {{multilayer}} thermodynamic framework, {{the authors}} show {{the influence of}} the dipole orientation in electrocapillary systems. In the case of a low rate of orientation in the surface layer, the electrocapillarity equation of Lipmann must be modified. The new terms allow an approach of the <b>electrocapillary</b> <b>phenomena</b> when the orientation is delayed. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|When a {{potential}} difference {{is applied to}} two immiscible liquids in contact with each other, the interfacial tension changes with it. Such an <b>electrocapillary</b> <b>phenomenon</b> takes place over a reasonable potential range, i. e. from ca. - 20 to + 20 V, only when the system has a sufficiently high electric conductance and contains surface active agents. For a system of an organic solvent (oil phase) in contact with an aqueous solution (aqueous phase), the electrocapillary curve has a characteristic shape depending on the ionic type of the surface active agents; the interfacial tension is suppressed over the cathodic or anodic polarization range according as the surface active agent is cationic or anionic. Here, the sign of polarization is taken {{as that of the}} aqueous phase with respect to the oil phase. In the case of amphoteric surface active agents the shape of curves depends on the pH value of the aqueous phase, being the anionic or cationic type according as the pI-I value is higher or lower than a certain value, the interfacial isoelectric point. The electrolyte in the aqueous phase not only enhances the electric conductance, but also changes the shape of the electrocapillary curve. This is ascribed to the counterion bind-ing of the polar head group of the surface active agent immersed in the aqueous side of the interface...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} recent renewed {{interest}} in <b>electrocapillary</b> and electrowetting <b>phenomena</b> given its potential for microfluidic actuation and manipulation. Different approaches, in which a variety of electrode configurations have been adopted, however, have dominated the developments in this field. These different approaches {{have given rise to}} rich and varied behavior, which has often led to some overlap and confusion in the literature. In this article, we delineate the different observations and elucidate the relationship between these phenomena by re-stressing classical concepts and examining their limita-tions. Particular emphasis is placed on the distinction between static and spontaneous electrowetting. In the former, a static change in the liquidâ€“solid macroscopic contact an-gle results when a dielectric film-coated planar plate electrode is employed. In the latter, a spontaneous thin front-running electrowetting film is pulled out ahead of the macro-scopic drop with the use of planar parallel line electrodes. This dynamically evolving electrowetting film advances much faster than the macroscopic drop itself and behaves in a self-similar manner analogous to gravity spreading films...|$|R
40|$|Tetraethylammonium perchlorate, {{compared}} to lithium perchlorate as background electrolyte for {{the reduction of}} pyridinium ion in pyridine, is effective over a wider potential range, but {{is more difficult to}} obtain in a pure state; slight amounts of impurities do not, however, affect the pyridinium wave. The pyridinium wave produced in 0. 1 M Et 4 NClO 4 may occur at a more negative potential than the main pyridinium wave in 0. 1 M LiClO 4, depending on the source of the pyridinium ion, but still appears to be due to a diffusion-controlled reduction, whose limiting current is linearly proportional to concentration; the prewave observed in LiCl 04 background generally does not appear in Et 4 NClO 4 background. Specific differences in the effect of Li(I), Na(I) and Et 4 N(I) background cation appear to be due to <b>electrocapillary</b> <b>phenomena</b> and perhaps to the extent of solvation of the ions. The constancy of current for solutions containing acetic acid with added acetate, pyridinium nitrate with added nitrate, and benzoic acid with added benzoate indicate that the pyridinium reduction is independent of anion concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{range of}} {{electrical}} potential of coalescence of aqueous droplets {{in the oil}} phase was studied, and was compared with the <b>electrocapillary</b> <b>phenomena</b> at the oil-water inter-face. The experimental method was {{essentially the same as}} that of the coalescence of mercury droplets mentioned previously. If neither the aqueous nor oil phase contained the surface active material, aqueous droplets in the oiI phase always coalesced over the whole range of the applied electrical potential. On the other hand, when the oil phase contained an ionic surface active agent, the repulsion of the aqueous droplets was observed at po-tentials higher than a certain value. This potential was governed by the ionic strength of the oil phase; the range of electricaI potential of coalescence increased with increasing ionic strength of the oil phase. This tendency was similar to that of the coalescence of mercury droplets in the inorganic electrolyte solution. In the Iatter case the coalescence was prevented by the electrostatic repulsion between mercury droplets. When the oil phase contained the nonionic, instead of ionic, surface active agent, the condition of coalescence of aqueous droplets was independent of the ionic strength of the oil phase as well as the electrical potential, but depended on the concentration of the nonionic surface active agent; the coalescence was prevented only if the concentration of the agent exceeded a certain value. It was thus concluded that aqueous droplets in the nonionic surface active agent solution was protected by the adsorbed layer...|$|E
