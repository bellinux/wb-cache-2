5|$|The {{situation}} with the European powers grew worse, and on June 18, 1812 the United States declared war on Great Britain, beginning the War of 1812. Cries <b>grew</b> <b>louder</b> for Shelby to return as Kentucky's chief executive. On July 18, 1812, {{less than a month}} before the election, Shelby acquiesced and announced his candidacy.|$|E
25|$|Air Farce {{remained}} popular {{through its}} radio run and initially as a TV series, {{but over the}} years interest in the show dropped, ratings fell, and criticism <b>grew</b> <b>louder.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the July 1977 election, {{relations}} between the Sinhalese and the Ceylon Tamil people became worse. There was flash violence {{in parts of the}} country. It is estimated about 100 people were killed and thousands of people fled from their homes. Among all these tensions, the call for a separate state among Tamil people <b>grew</b> <b>louder.</b>|$|E

25|$|At dawn of {{the third}} day, there was thunder, lightning, a dense cloud upon the {{mountain}}, and a very loud blast of the horn. Moses led the people {{to the foot of}} the mountain. Mount Sinai was all in smoke, the mountain trembled violently, the blare of the horn <b>grew</b> <b>louder</b> and louder, and God answered Moses in thunder.|$|E
25|$|The {{demographic}} {{transformation of}} the county following World War II, however, forced a change. The rapid suburbanization of those years brought with it a dramatic rise in traffic and crime that threatened to overwhelm the 33 separate law enforcement agencies then operating within Suffolk County. Voices demanding a unified county police force, {{similar to the one}} already operating in neighboring Nassau County, <b>grew</b> <b>louder.</b>|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the {{democratisation}} of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe had irreparably {{undermined the}} power of the CPSU and Gorbachev himself. The relaxation of censorship and attempts to create more political openness had the unintended effect of re-awakening long-suppressed nationalist and anti-Russian feelings in the Soviet republics. Calls for greater independence from Moscow's rule <b>grew</b> <b>louder,</b> especially in the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, which had been annexed into the Soviet Union by Joseph Stalin in 1940. Nationalist feeling also took hold in Georgia, Ukraine, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.|$|E

25|$|Labor {{unrest in}} the {{industrial}} and mining sections of the Northeast and Midwest led to demands for a stronger military force within the states. After the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, calls for military suppression of labor strikes <b>grew</b> <b>louder,</b> and National Guard units proliferated. In many states, large and elaborate armories, often built to resemble medieval castles, were constructed to house militia units. Businessmen and business associations donated monies {{for the construction of}} armories and to supplement funds of the local National Guard units. National Guard officers also came from the middle and upper classes.|$|E
25|$|In August 1904, Trumper, with Hanson Carter, {{opened a}} sports store in Market Street, Sydney. Although {{he is best}} known for his prowess as a cricketer, Trumper was also a {{competent}} rugby player and can lay claim to being the prime mover in the development of rugby league in Australia. He hosted meetings at his store during 1907 as discontent amongst players with the game's administration <b>grew</b> <b>louder.</b> On 8 August 1907 at Bateman's Crystal Hotel, George Street, Sydney independent politician Henry Hoyle chaired a meeting of fifty, comprising several leading rugby players and officials. The New South Wales Rugby Football League, the body that would go on to conduct the major national rugby league premiership of Australia, was founded and Trumper was elected its first treasurer.|$|E
500|$|The third game {{featured}} the world champion Czechoslovaks against the Olympic champion Soviets. Czechoslovakia justified pre-tournament expectations by winning 5–3 while the Soviets {{complained about the}} scheduling, claiming organizers deliberately matched them up against the Czechoslovaks in their opening game to set them at an early disadvantage in the tournament. The Soviet complaints <b>grew</b> <b>louder</b> following a 3–3 tie against Sweden. [...] While the Swedish press was hailing Salming as the greatest player in their nation's history after his second consecutive dominant effort, the Soviets threatened to quit the tournament as they were upset about the officiating of Canadian referee Andre Legace. Organizers {{did not take the}} Soviet threats to quit the tournament seriously.|$|E

500|$|During the non-conference season, Farmer made notable plays late in {{important}} games, including a game-clinching rebound against Indiana {{and a key}} three-pointer in the waning minutes of a game against Ohio. In a January 2, 1992, game against Notre Dame, Farmer entered the game after just three minutes when starter Dale Brown sprained his ankle. In the first half, he equaled his career high of 22 points [...] including five three-point baskets [...] {{en route to a}} new career-high of 28 in a 9170 victory. This performance notwithstanding, complaints from the fan base about Farmer's lack of playing time [...] he averaged 17.7 minutes per game through early February [...] <b>grew</b> <b>louder</b> and eventually became the subject of media interest. In January, two of Kentucky's smaller newspapers printed articles on the subject [...] one speculating that Pitino was intentionally holding Farmer back so Farmer's popularity wouldn't eclipse his own. Kentucky beat writer Jerry Tipton addressed the topic at length in a Lexington Herald-Leader column on February 8, drawing a rebuke from Pitino, who called the issue a [...] "non-story".|$|E
2500|$|News of {{the scandal}} first broke on January 17, 1998, on the Drudge Report, which {{reported}} that Newsweek editors were sitting on a story by investigative reporter Michael Isikoff exposing the affair. The story broke in the mainstream press on January 21 in The Washington Post. The story swirled for several days and, despite swift denials from Clinton, the clamor for answers from the White House <b>grew</b> <b>louder.</b> On January 26, President Clinton, standing with his wife, spoke at a White House press conference, and issued a forceful denial in which he said: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1891, the Canadian Pacific Railway's main line, {{which had}} passed well south of Edmonton, was {{extended}} northward into Strathcona, {{then known as}} South Edmonton. [...] Edmonton came to fear {{that the presence of}} the railway across the North Saskatchewan River would result in it being surpassed by its southern neighbour, and calls for the railway to be brought to Edmonton <b>grew</b> <b>louder</b> (this objective would be achieved in 1905). [...] As part of these efforts, it was judged appropriate to apply for a town charter, which was granted effective February 15, 1892, when the first town council was to be sworn into office. [...] The election of the first council was fixed for February 10.|$|E

2500|$|He {{said his}} prayer was {{interrupted}} by a [...] "being from the unseen world". Smith said the being caused his tongue to swell in his mouth so that he could not speak. One account said he heard a noise behind him like someone walking towards him and then, when he tried to pray again, the noise <b>grew</b> <b>louder,</b> causing him to spring to his feet and look around, but he saw no one. In some of the accounts, he described being covered with a thick darkness and thinking that he would be destroyed. At his darkest moment, he knelt a third time to pray and, as he summoned all his power to pray, he felt ready to sink into oblivion. At that moment, he said his tongue was loosed and he saw a vision.|$|E
2500|$|Soon, Simon Cameron, Lincoln's Secretary of War, {{was being}} accused of incompetently {{handling}} his department, and some wanted him to resign. Cameron sought out Stanton to advise him on legal matters concerning the War Department's acquisitions, among other things. Calls for Cameron to resign <b>grew</b> <b>louder</b> when he endorsed a bombastic November 1861 speech given by Col. John Cochrane to his unit. [...] "e should take the slave by the hand, placing a musket in it, and bid him in God's name strike for the liberty of the human race", Cochrane said. Cameron embraced Cochrane's sentiment that slaves should be armed, but it was met with repudiation in Lincoln's cabinet. Caleb B. Smith, the Secretary in the Department of the Interior, scolded Cameron for his support of Cochrane.|$|E
