5|$|Contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud {{formed when}} water vapor from the <b>exhaust</b> of a jet engine {{condenses}} on particles, which come {{from either the}} surrounding air or the <b>exhaust</b> itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The <b>exhaust</b> can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei {{when there is an}} insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the impact of total soy saponins (TS) on the myocardial antioxidant capacity in rats exercised to exhaustion. MethodsThe one-time <b>exhausted</b> treadmill model was used. All rats were divided into 4 groups: the control group, the TS group, the <b>exhausted</b> group, and the TS <b>exhausted</b> group. The TS and TS <b>exhausted</b> groups were fed TS at a dosage of 20 [*]mg/kg body weight, once a day, for 2 weeks. The <b>exhausted</b> group was given a placebo, and the control group was not given any treatment. The treadmill speed was set at 30 [*]m/min, and the rats (<b>exhausted</b> and TS <b>exhausted</b> groups) were trained at this speed until <b>exhausted.</b> The rats were decapitated and anatomized immediately after <b>exhausted.</b> A 10 % homogenate of the myocardial tissue was prepared. ResultsTS significantly increased the exercise time by 20. 62 % (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). As compared with the control group, the enzyme activities for catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and glutathione reductase (GR) were significantly enhanced in the TS group (p[*]<[*] 0. 01); GR and GSH-Px activity was significantly enhanced in the TS <b>exhausted</b> group (p[*]<[*] 0. 01); malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly decreased in the TS <b>exhausted</b> group (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). As compared with the <b>exhausted</b> group, the GSH-Px activity was significantly enhanced in the TS <b>exhausted</b> group (p[*]<[*] 0. 01); CAT, GSH-Px, and GR activities were significantly enhanced in the TS group (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). As compared with the TS group, the CAT and GR activity in the TS <b>exhausted</b> group was significantly decreased (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). ConclusionTS can improve the exercised rats' antioxidant activity in their cardiac muscle to varying degrees, decrease MDA and serum AST and LDH levels, increase the exercise time, and delay the occurrence of sports fatigue...|$|R

40|$|A set {{of burning}} {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the influence of smoke vent height and <b>exhausting</b> velocity on mechanical smoke <b>exhausting</b> efficiency. Results {{have shown that the}} smoke <b>exhausting</b> process becomes more efficient due to the increased smoke vent height and the decreased <b>exhausting</b> velocity, which eliminate the plug-holing issue with fewer disturbances on the smoke layer interface. For each certain <b>exhausting</b> velocity, there is a critical value of distance between the vent and the bottom of the smoke layer. When the distance is less than the critical value, the smoke <b>exhausting</b> is inefficient, and the efficiency decreases sharply as the distance decreases. Contrarily, when the distance is greater than the critical value, a good efficiency can be acquired and the <b>exhausted</b> smoke increased relatively slowly as the distance increases. A critical Froude number, proposed by Hinkley to predict the onset of plug-holing effect in gravity venting systems, was validated in the experiments. However, the experimental results indicate that in the tests without the plug-holing, the fresh air entrained due to smoke <b>exhausting</b> is up to 48 % of the mechanical <b>exhausting</b> rate...|$|R

Akagi and Kaga were given different solutions to evaluate in real-world conditions. Akagi was given two funnels on the starboard side. The larger, forward funnel was angled 30° below horizontal with its mouth facing the sea, and the smaller one exhausted vertically a little past the edge of the flight deck. The forward funnel was fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by hot <b>exhaust</b> gases and a cover that could be raised to allow the <b>exhaust</b> gases to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea.

40|$|Programmed death- 1 (PD- 1) regulates T cell {{exhaustion}} during chronic infections. Blocking the PD- 1 :PD-ligand (PD-L) pathway reinvigorates <b>exhausted</b> CD 8 T cells. Exactly how blocking PD- 1 :PD-L interactions improves T cell immunity, however, remains unclear. PD- 1 :PD-L blockade could reprogram all <b>exhausted</b> T {{cells to}} become antiviral effectors. Alternatively, this blockade might selectively expand {{a subset of}} <b>exhausted</b> T cells. We have identified two subpopulations of <b>exhausted</b> CD 8 T cells during chronic viral infection in mice. One subset of <b>exhausted</b> CD 8 T cells is rescued by αPD-L 1 blockade, whereas the other subset appears more terminally differentiated and responds poorly to PD- 1 :PD-L blockade. Blocking PD- 1 :PD-L interactions reduces spontaneous apoptosis and enhances expansion and protective immunity of the rescuable subset, but not the more terminally differentiated subset of <b>exhausted</b> CD 8 T cells.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{observe the}} effect of lit-moxa {{stimulating}} acupoint Guanyuan (CV 4) on lactic acid and super-oxide dismutase (SOD) in skeletal muscle after exercise exhaustion. MethodsTwenty-eight adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into normal control group, <b>exhausted</b> control group, exercise group and moxibustion group using exercise training and mild heating with lit-moxa stick as treatment methods. The <b>exhausted</b> control group, moxibustion group and exercise group received an exhaustive swimming after 20 days of intervention. Swimming <b>exhausted</b> times were recorded. Lactic acid and SOD concentration in soleus muscle were detected and compared between every two groups. ResultsThe swimming <b>exhausted</b> times of the moxibustion group and the exercise group were significantly increased compare to the <b>exhausted</b> control group (P < 0. 05). The lactic acid of the <b>exhausted</b> control group was significantly increased comparing with the normal control group (P < 0. 05), and the lactic acid of the moxibustion group and the exercise group were significantly {{lower than that of}} the <b>exhausted</b> control group (P < 0. 05). The SOD level of the <b>exhausted</b> control group was significantly decreased comparing with the normal control group (P < 0. 05), and the SOD level of the moxibustion group and the exercise group were significantly higher than that of the <b>exhausted</b> control group (both, P < 0. 05). There was no statistical difference between the moxibustion group and the exercise group.

In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave <b>exhaust</b> tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal <b>Exhaust,</b> battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, <b>exhaust</b> pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal <b>Exhaust.</b> The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel.
