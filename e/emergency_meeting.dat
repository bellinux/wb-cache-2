5|$|On {{the evening}} of 1October Valckenier {{received}} reports that a crowd of a thousand Chinese had gathered outside the gate, angered by his statements at the <b>emergency</b> <b>meeting</b> five days earlier. This report was received incredulously by Valckenier and the council. However, after {{the murder of a}} Balinese sergeant by the Chinese outside the walls, the council decided to take extraordinary measures and reinforce the guard. Two groups of 50 Europeans and some native porters were sent to outposts on the south and east sides of the city, and a plan of attack was formulated.|$|E
5|$|After a {{long period}} of {{repression}} by the Dutch colonial government, ethnic Chinese in Batavia (modern day Jakarta) revolted on 7 October 1740, killing fifty Dutch troops in Meester Cornelis (now Jatinegara) and Tanah Abang. This revolt was quashed by Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier, who sent 1,800 troops, together with schutterij (militia) and eleven battalions of conscripts, to the two areas; they imposed a curfew on all Chinese inside the city walls to prevent them from plotting against the Dutch. When a group of 10,000 ethnic Chinese from nearby Tangerang and Bekasi was stopped at the gates the following day, Valckenier called an <b>emergency</b> <b>meeting</b> of the council for 9 October. The day of the meeting, the Dutch and other ethnic groups in Batavia began to kill all ethnic Chinese in the city, resulting in an estimated 10,000 deaths over two weeks.|$|E

5|$|The {{party was}} {{according}} to political scientist Cas Mudde only very rarely accused of anti-Semitism – and even then, it was strongly condemned {{by the party}} leadership. When Roeland Raes {{cast doubt on the}} scale of the Holocaust in a television interview in 2001 for instance, the party leadership immediately called an <b>emergency</b> <b>meeting,</b> distanced itself from him and forced him to resign. The party also took screening measures against its local candidates to reveal any possible extremist connections, and rather wanted to risk not being able to fill its lists, rather than filling them with extremists. Particularly, the party wanted to distance itself from Holocaust denial, as it actively sought to reach out to Jewish voters in Antwerp.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1984 Winter Olympics, {{a dispute}} formed over what made a player a professional. The IOC had adopted {{a rule that}} made any player who had signed an NHL {{contract}} but played less than ten games in the league eligible. However, the United States Olympic Committee maintained that any player contracted with an NHL team was a professional and therefore not eligible to play. The IOC held an <b>emergency</b> <b>meeting</b> that ruled NHL-contracted players were eligible, {{as long as they}} had not played in any NHL games. This made five players on Olympic rosters—one Austrian, two Italians and two Canadians—ineligible. Players who had played in other professional leagues—such as the World Hockey Association—were allowed to play. Canadian hockey official Alan Eagleson stated that the rule was only applied to the NHL and that professionally contracted players in European leagues were still considered amateurs. Murray Costello of the CAHA suggested that a Canadian withdrawal was possible. In 1986, the IOC voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games starting in 1988, but let the individual sport federations decide if they wanted to allow professionals.|$|E

5|$|Entering {{international}} play in 1954, the Soviet {{national team}} {{under the tutelage}} of Anatoli Tarasov started to dominate the international competitions, and won nine consecutive championships in the 1960s. Canada, in response, developed a national team of its own. But Canada's best players usually became professionals and the national team featured mostly university players. The Canadian team did not win any championships and was looked upon as a failure. By 1969, the Government of Canada had formed Hockey Canada, an organization to co-ordinate Canadian international play with its amateur organizations and the NHL. In July 1969, on a trial basis, the inclusion of nine professional players for any event for one year was agreed to by the IIHF. Canada entered a team with five professionals in the Izvestia tournament at Christmas in 1969, and nearly won the tournament. The IIHF then convened an <b>emergency</b> <b>meeting</b> in January 1970, and the rule allowing professionals was rescinded. In response, Canada withdrew from IIHF play. The 1970 IIHF World Championships, scheduled to be held in Canada for the first time, were transferred to Sweden after Canada refused to host the event.|$|E
5|$|On 11 August 2014, a Cabinet Office Briefing Room (COBR) <b>emergency</b> <b>meeting</b> {{concluded}} that the RAF would deploy Tornado GR4s to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus in support of refugees sheltering from Islamic State militants in the Mount Sinjar region of Iraq. The decision came {{three days after the}} United States began conducting air attacks against the Islamic State. Tornados were pre-positioned to use their surveillance capabilities to gather situational awareness to help with humanitarian efforts. On 29 September 2014, three days after Parliament approved of airstrikes against Islamic State forces inside Iraq, two Tornados conducted their first armed reconnaissance mission over the country, in conjunction with other coalition aircraft, and were cleared to conduct airstrikes if needed. Britain's first airstrike was conducted the next day, when two Tornados hit a heavy weapons post and an armored vehicle in the process of supporting Kurdish forces in northwest Iraq. By 1 March 2015, eight RAF Tornados had been deployed to Akrotiri and conducted 159 airstrikes against IS targets in Iraq.|$|E
5|$|On 2 January an <b>emergency</b> <b>meeting</b> {{was held}} at the Independence Palace in Saigon between President Thiệu, the Joint General Staff, and General Dong. At the meeting, Dong {{presented}} a plan for the relief of Phước Long that would have utilized either an infantry division or the Airborne Division. The plan was turned down for three reasons: first, there were simply no reserve forces of sufficient size available anywhere in the country for the task; second, with all overland routes in enemy hands, all movements and logistics would have to depend entirely on airlift, a capability that no longer existed; and third, despite advantageous defensive positions, the forces at Phước Long could not hold off two communist divisions long enough for any relief effort to succeed. The decision was then reached. Phước Long City and province would be surrendered to North Vietnamese forces as a matter of expediency, since it was considered to be strategically less important than Tây Ninh, Pleiku, or Huế – economically, politically, and demographically.|$|E

5|$|On August 17, when a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for Jamaica, Prime Minister of Jamaica Portia Simpson-Miller convened an <b>emergency</b> <b>meeting</b> of Jamaica's national disaster preparedness council.

The North-West Caribbean Donor Group also met to consider what action might it might undertake in Dean's aftermath.|$|E
5|$|On September2, the National Hurricane Center issued gale {{warnings}} and hurricane watches for Guadeloupe, Desirade, Antigua and Barbuda. Later that day, the gale warnings were expanded southward to include islands north of Dominica. After Christine weakened to a tropical depression, the NHC discontinued all watches and warnings for the Leeward Islands. Schools were closed in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands as a precaution. Six scientists {{had to be}} evacuated from the small island of Aves once the storm posed a threat to them. On St. Thomas, nine emergency shelters were opened, mainly in schools. On September5, an <b>emergency</b> <b>meeting</b> was held by disaster officials in Puerto Rico about the threat of flooding from Christine. All residents were urged by government officials to have their disaster kits ready {{and be prepared to}} evacuate if told to do so. Firefighters, on and off-duty, were advised about the possibility of evacuations and would be pulled into work if needed.|$|E
5|$|Venezuela's then-{{president}} Ramón José Velásquez held an <b>emergency</b> <b>meeting</b> {{to respond}} to the Bret's heavy damage. The president conveyed three days of national mourning due to the storm. About 1,400workers and volunteers helped in rescue efforts after the mudslides struck Caracas and surrounding areas, assisted by Red Cross volunteers and 800firefighters. Volunteers provided water and medicine to the affected, while workers emptied residual pools of water to mitigate the spread of disease. Storm victims were temporarily housed at the Fuerte Tiuna army base. Roads were quickly cleared of debris and mud, although many were not reopened initially due to the threat for additional mudslides. Within a week of the storm's passage, telephone service was largely repaired in Caracas and airline travel was restored. After the storm, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provided US$50,000 in emergency spending, and UNICEF sent US$15,000 to buy oral rehydration salts. A Venezuelan radio station held a marathon to collect relief items, such as food or clothing.|$|E

5|$|Immediately upon {{receiving}} the order, Shimon Avidan called an <b>emergency</b> <b>meeting</b> at Hatzor. Yehoshua Goldrat, the only {{officer in the}} brigade who had experience from the British Army operating a combined force of infantry, armor, artillery and air, wrote the operational order. The order was in English, as Goldrat was not fluent in Hebrew, and was handed out to the battalion commanders on June 1. The battalion commanders translated the document into Hebrew for the company commanders. According to the plan, six companies (3 Palmach and 3 Irgun) would attack the Egyptians from the south. Three companies (2 from the 52nd and one from the 51st battalions) would attack from the north, and two companies (one from the 53rd Battalion and one from Irgun) would prevent a retreat to the east. A company from the 53rd Battalion would block reinforcement from Majdal. Only senior officers knew of the full plans however. Simha Shiloni, commander of the Palmach forces (Negev Beasts Battalion), commented that his forces came exhausted and completely unprepared to the assembly points, and he had given consent for their deployment only after being assured that they would serve as the operational reserve (the plan in fact called for these forces to lead the southern assault).|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the violence there were widespread calls for Modi to resign as chief minister from within and outside the state, including from leaders of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party (allies in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition), and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue. Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa, but it was not accepted. His cabinet had an <b>emergency</b> <b>meeting</b> on 19 July 2002, after which it offered its resignation to the Gujarat Governor S. S. Bhandari, and the state assembly was dissolved. Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said that a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002. In the elections, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly. Although Modi later denied it, he made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign, and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among the voters. Modi hired the public relations firm APCO Worldwide to manage his image. He won the Maninagar constituency, receiving 1,13,589 of 1,54,981 votes and defeating INC candidate Yatin Oza by 75,333 votes. On 22 December 2002, Bhandari swore Modi in for a second term. Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride, a strategy which led to the BJP winning two-thirds of the seats in the state assembly.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{believing the}} Iraqi Army would only {{advance to the}} Ramallah oil field, Schwarzkopf was {{surprised}} when the Iraqis captured Kuwait City. Fearing Iraq would next invade Saudi Arabia, Schwarzkopf ordered contingency plans put in motion, with the 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division and 24th Infantry Division put on alert. He was then called to an <b>emergency</b> <b>meeting</b> with President George H. W. Bush, where his Internal Look '90 strategic plans were made {{the basis of a}} potential counteroffensive plan. By August 5, Bush opted for an aggressive response to the invasion. Schwarzkopf then accompanied Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to meet with Saudi King Fahd to convince him to allow U.S. troops into Saudi Arabia to counter the Iraqi military. With Fahd's consent, Bush ordered troops into Saudi Arabia on August 7, initially tasked to defend Saudi Arabia should Iraq attack. U.S. commanders from the beginning wanted a quick conflict characterized by decisive, overwhelming force, as opposed to the gradual escalation of U.S. involvement as had been seen in Vietnam. Schwarzkopf in particular was very adamant that many of the policies governing military operations in Vietnam, especially slow escalation of air power and troop force, not reoccur. His plan for direct and overwhelming force was initially criticized in Washington as uncreative. By August 13, the news media began to closely cover Schwarzkopf, who had been named to lead the operation.|$|E
