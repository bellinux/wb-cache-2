The reference method values were comparöd with the corresponding method-dependent assigned values. Sodium: Measurements by flame photometry and <b>ion</b> <b>selective</b> <b>electrodes</b> differed on the whole by less than 1 % from the reference method value; determinations by photometry differed, however, by — 4. 7 %. Potassium: The mean bias was — 1. 2 % with flame photometry and — 0. 4 % with <b>ion</b> <b>selective</b> <b>electrodes,</b> whereas nephelometric procedures differed by — 1. 9 or — 4. 8 %. Chloride: Satisfactory agreement was obtained with values given for <b>ion</b> <b>selective</b> <b>electrodes</b> (— 0. 3 %), for some coülometric procedures (— 0. 7 and — 0. 4 %), and photometric determinations using mercury rhodanide (— 0. 5 and + 0. 7 %).

40|$|Determination of the {{chloride}} concentration at {{the depth}} of the rebar is important when studying the mechanisms of chloride-induced corrosion. It is generally assumed that only the chloride ions dissolved in the concrete pore solution can initiate corrosion, while those bound by the constituents of the cement paste are considered harmless. Attempts to use <b>ion</b> <b>selective</b> <b>electrodes</b> in concrete, to non-destructively monitor the free chloride concentration, have thus been made by several researchers. In the present work, results from laboratory experiments with such chloride sensors are presented. It was found that the presence of concentration gradients such as pH differences markedly influences the measurement of the sensor potential and thereby the accuracy of this chloride measurement technique. This has {{to be taken into account}} carefully when designing an experimental setup involving the use of <b>ion</b> <b>selective</b> <b>electrodes...</b>|$|R

50|$|Potentiometric sensors {{measure a}} {{potential}} or charge accumulation of an electrochemical cell. The transducer typically comprises an <b>ion</b> <b>selective</b> <b>electrode</b> (ISE) and a reference electrode. The ISE features a membrane that selectively {{interacts with the}} charged ion of interest, causing the accumulation of a charge potential compared to the reference electrode. The reference electrode provides a constant half-cell potential that is unaffected by analyte concentration. A high impedance voltmeter is {{used to measure the}} electromotive force or potential between the two electrodes when zero or no signiﬁcant current ﬂows between them. The potentiometric response is governed by the Nernst equation in that the potential is proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of the analyte.|$|E
5000|$|The {{titration}} {{environment is}} considered unsuitable for conventional titration sensors. For example, glass membrane pH electrodes {{must be kept}} adequately hydrated for proper operation. The use of such electrodes in substantially non-aqueous media as in the determination of trace acids in lipids and lubricating oils can lead to loss of performance as the membrane fouls and dehydrates, and/or if the reference junction is partly or completely blocked. It is often necessary to keep a number of electrodes cycling through a rejuvenation program {{in order to keep}} up with an analytical workload. Thermometric sensors have no electrochemical interaction with the titrating solution, and therefore can be used on a continuous basis with essentially no maintenance. Similarly, the potentiometric titration of sulfate with barium chloride in various industrial samples can lead to rapid degradation of the indicating barium <b>ion</b> <b>selective</b> <b>electrode.</b>|$|E
