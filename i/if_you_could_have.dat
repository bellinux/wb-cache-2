[...] "Oh, Godwin and Wulf! if {{you could}} know how she thought of and made ready everything; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> seen how all those cruel men glared at us, searching out our very souls! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> heard how high she {{answered}} them, waving that ring before their eyes and bidding them to obey its presence, or to die!" ...|$|E
60|$|ENID. Of course <b>you</b> don't; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> proper--- Will you see {{my doctor}} if I send him to you? I'm sure he'd do you good.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry you}} had to take it," [...] said Milly, [...] "at such a {{different}} time from ours. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> but <b>have</b> worked while we've been working--" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> it of originals, {{you would}} wish {{very much to}} have a {{complete}} collection of casts, of course selected from all the finest sculptures in the world?--Certainly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No I haven't,' she returned, 'not {{a bit of}} it. Don't {{you mind}} about me. I like sitting up, and I've often had a sleep, bless you, {{in one of them}} chairs. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> seen how you tried to jump out o' winder, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> heard how you used to keep on singing and making speeches, you wouldn't have {{believed}} it--I'm so glad you're better, Mr Liverer.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{would you}} have thought, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been there? Our little chapel looked nice with the red hangings and sandal-wood lectern.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain, tenderly: [...] "Have you, dearest? I {{always think}} of it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> seen Benny, how I left him, just now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Olaf, Olaf, for {{the second}} time in my life you make me feel ashamed. Oh! <b>if</b> only <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> loved me! Then I should have grown good like you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Miss Sharp! <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> but see {{him this}} morning," [...] he said--"moaning in his flowered dressing-gown--writhing on his sofa; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> but <b>have</b> seen him lolling out his tongue to Gollop the apothecary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The very man. And, O Miss Olive, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> but <b>have</b> {{seen him}} in his wedding-clothes your heart would have broken {{to think that you}} had lost the {{opportunity}} of standing by them at the altar." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{seen the}} face that was turned up to me,--all you other men in the world,--you would have torn your hair in despair.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know he is}} troublesome," [...] {{the woman}} only {{addressed}} herself to the male now--"but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> him punished without beating--he is really delicate." ...|$|E
6000|$|Urmston's face flushed. [...] "I think I {{could have}} been capable of {{a good deal more}} than I {{probably}} ever shall be now, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> trusted me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ah! <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> {{kept them}} {{for your own}} miniature! But, wicked, roving, restless, too {{impartial}} eyes, it was enough for any one to stand before them, and, straightway, there he danced and sparkled quite as merrily as you! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then what is it?" [...] she asked, {{turning to}} him abruptly. [...] "You {{know you have}} no other place when you leave here, nor any chance {{as good as the}} one father offers you.

6000|$|... "Well, my dear," [...] he said, [...] "the war hasn't changed Robin Hill, <b>has</b> it? <b>If</b> only <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> brought Jolly {{back with}} you! I say, {{can you stand}} this spiritualistic racket? When the oak-tree dies, it dies, I'm afraid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Gracie, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> heard how utterly without {{principle}} she is: urging {{me to put}} {{my property}} {{out of my hands}} dishonestly, to keep her in luxury!" ...|$|E
60|$|Wendy was {{so shocked}} that she exclaimed, 'He doesn't know!' and always after this {{she felt that}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> a pet pirate Smee would be her one.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{you would}} have looked at them more curiously yet, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> guessed what I have to tell you,' said her friend. 'One of those houses is mine.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind, colonel; {{but you know}} you promised {{to give us a}} chance <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could,</b> and <b>having</b> a chance of course means having extra danger; but I really don't think that there would be any great danger in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, Edmund," [...] {{interposed}} Gerald, [...] "Lionel and I {{had such}} fun the other day. We caught the old donkey and blindfolded {{it with our}} handkerchiefs, and let it loose, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> but <b>have</b> seen how it kicked up its heels----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, well; that's {{the same}} thing. It was Givantake, {{though of course}} he isn't going to sign his name to everything. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> just <b>have</b> written a line to your friend the Postmaster-General, I really think we <b>could</b> <b>have</b> squared it all." ...|$|R
60|$|She went to {{her room}} and did {{something}} with the black doll. She did not cry, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> seen her face you would have wished she would cry.|$|E

6000|$|... "Friend John, {{forgive me}} if I pain. I showed not my feeling to others when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> looked into my heart then when I want to laugh, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done so when the laugh arrived, {{if you could do}} so now, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him, for he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time, maybe you would perhaps pity me the most of all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poverty again!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Crowder. [...] "It is dreadful to hear {{so much of}} it. <b>If</b> <b>thee</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> {{carried away}} with thee one of thy diamonds, thee might have cracked it up into little pieces, and thee might have sold these, one at a time, without suspicion." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "There {{are certain}} types of leaders. There are vocal leaders. There are leaders by example. Lavonte is a leader by example unquestionably.

6000|$|... "'Oh! Mr. MacShaughnassy,' {{he burst}} out, with {{a ring of}} genuine manliness in his voice, 'you don't know 'ow good, 'ow {{beautiful}} she is. I ain't fit to breathe 'er name in my thoughts. An' she's so clever. I met 'er at that Toynbee 'All. There was a party of toffs there all together. You would 'ave enjoyed it, Mr. MacShaughnassy, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>'ave</b> 'eard 'er; she was makin' fun of the pictures and the people round about to 'er pa--such wit, such learnin', such 'aughtiness. I follered them out and opened the carriage door for 'er, and she just drew 'er skirt aside {{and looked at me}} as if I was the dirt in the road. I wish I was, for then perhaps one day I'd kiss 'er feet.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] {{said the}} Woozy. [...] "Here's another and a dog, both safe and sound. But my word, Dorothy, you flew some! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> seen yourself, you'd have been {{absolutely}} astonished." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{heard the}} Story Girl's [...] "bur-r-r-r!" [...] Not old Mr. Forbes himself could have {{invested}} it {{with more of}} Doric scorn. We rolled over in the cool grass and screamed with laughter.|$|E
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>COULD</b> but <b>have</b> seen Munseer Anatole! Instead {{of looking}} twenty, {{he looked a}} thousand.

6000|$|... "Oh! pray stay then," [...] {{said his}} {{companion}} eagerly; [...] "I {{expect you to}} stay now. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> an idea what a relief conversing with you is, after having been dragged by the Crown Prince and whirled by that von Sohnspeer!
