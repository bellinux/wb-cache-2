50|$|An {{alternative}} {{version of}} the machine, popular in arcades, is the two button version: one marked with a forward arrow, one with a right arrow. The crane starts near the front, {{left side of the}} machine and the user presses first the <b>forward</b> <b>button</b> to move the crane towards the back of the cabinet. Once the button is released the crane stops moving and the button cannot be used again, thus requiring the user to judge depth accurately in one attempt. After this, the right button becomes active in a similar way and as soon as it is released, the crane drops to a certain depth and then raises, closing its claw on the way and returning to the drop hatch in the front left corner. These versions are generally considered to be more difficult. The button type machines typically do not feature the timers which are commonly found on joystick type machines.|$|E

She realizes that the remote can do magical things, and changes the channel to a contest show (a parody of Wheel of Fortune). A man is about to win 1,000,000 and he says he'll give it all to charity, Vicky is disgusted by this and screams [...] "Why can't that be ME!?" [...] and pounds on the remote in frustration. The remote zaps her into the TV contest and she is handed a bag of money, but the host takes it back when its pointed out that Vicky is 16, not 18 because she is too young {{to participate in the}} TV contest. Frustrated, Vicky smacks the remote again, pressing the fast <b>forward</b> <b>button</b> and aging her to 18. Vicky is now able to take the contest money, and she also begins to realize the power of the remote. She wants to go to the Dictator Week program on TV so that she can take over the world, which makes the host think she's really happy and on fire.|$|E

The main difference of the temporal scheme is that it maintains {{a complete list of}} previously visited pages. Results confirmed our prediction that the major limitation of the temporal system is in returning to parent pages. They also showed that the temporal scheme allowed many users to solve complex navigation tasks more efficiently than the stack system. Overall, the results are positive and indicate that the temporal scheme can be adapted to improve web navigation...|$|R

Participants held the clicker and pushed the <b>forward</b> <b>button</b> to advance. They viewed three trial examples of electrons being added to the counting sphere, a glass sphere {{in the middle of the}} screen. In the center was a slowly spinning nucleus (with protons in red and neutrons in yellow). The goal was to match the target number for valence and an animation either added or deleted electrons to reach the target qnet (displayed in upper left corner).|$|E

This {{simulation}} {{also worked}} {{with a mixture of}} the Kinect reading the position of the highest wrist joint and the participant clicking the clicker to signal the submission of an answer. In the high embodied condition participants used their highest hand to control placement of the meter. When the participant was satisfied with the placement of the meter s/he would hit the <b>forward</b> <b>button</b> on the clicker held in the dominant hand. Immediate feedback was displayed. If the placement was incorrect three times in a row, the system will show the correct answer as an animation.|$|E

When a participant would start to draw a vector the <b>forward</b> <b>button</b> was held down on the clicker and that button was released when the vector was finished. Similar to the low embodied version, this version also contained two levels of scaffolding; vectors were first animated as show trials, then they were generated (either as a video or by self) and scored.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{integrate}} technology into the language curriculum, {{it is essential}} not only to evaluate a program with a second language acquisition (SLA) framework but also seek the students’ attitudes towards the use of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) (Ayres, 2002). Addressing CALL evaluation, this paper reports on a 2 -year empirical study of learners’ perceptions, at the intermediate level, {{about the use of}} a web-based multimedia program with authentic video clips having full control of help options (i. e., dual input using subtitles in L 1 and L 2, pitch-correct slow play, and backward and <b>forward</b> <b>buttons,</b> transcripts and online dictionary) and its effectiveness as a language-learning tool guided by Chapelle’s (2001) framework. Students believed that the learned culture and vocabulary enhanced their listening skills. A pretest/posttest design assessed the long-term gains in listening and speaking performances. Results indicated a significant gain in listening and speaking skills because posttest scores were significantly higher than pretest scores. The paper concludes by highlighting what lessons to consider when integrating CALL into language courses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Computer {{simulation}} {{attempts to}} “mimic ” real-life or hypothetical behavior {{on a computer}} to see how processes or systems can be improved and to predict their performance under different circumstances. Simulation has been successfully applied in many disciplines and {{is considered to be}} a relevant and highly applicable tool in Business Process Management (BPM). Unfortunately, in reality the use of simulation is limited. Few organizations actively use simulation. Even organizations that purchase simulation software (stand-alone or embedded in some BPM suite), typically fail to use it continuously over an extended period. This keynote paper highlights some of the problems causing the limited adoption of simulation. For example, simulation models tend to oversimplify the modeling of people working part-time on a process. Also simulation studies typically focus on the steady-state behavior of business processes while managers are more interested in short-term results (a “fast <b>forward</b> <b>button</b> ” into the future) for operational decision making...|$|E

3000|$|... (B) Vector van Gogh – High Embodied. The Kinect {{was used}} to track the highest hand. The clicker {{was held in the}} active highest hand. The goal of the high {{embodied}} version was for the participant to draw in the air the correct length and direction of the vector. When a participant would start to draw a vector the <b>forward</b> <b>button</b> was held down on the clicker and that button was released when the vector was finished. Similar to version A, this version also contained scaffolding. The first two trials were animations showing the answer. The next two trials used shadowed gray vectors to show the length and direction and the participants would trace over the gray vectors with yellow ones. In the final trials, participants would draw the vectors freehand. Immediate feedback was given after every submission. Per usual, participants were allowed three trials to get it right (0.05 match slop allowed). After the second attempt, a hint popped up to remind participants that the free charge that serves as the start point had a valence of + 1. After a third error, the vector was animated for them.|$|E

The selection of a link appears to the user as a page change; the choice of links changes to represent the updated search {{and the results are}} filtered by the new criteria. Selecting a navigation link changes the current query and also the URL that is associated with it. The back button can be used to return to the previous search state.

40|$|In this paper, we distill {{several years}} of our {{research}} on understanding and improving how people return to their previously visited web pages. Our motivation is that web page revisitation {{is one of the}} most frequent actions in computer use, and consequently any interface improvements in this area [...] -no matter how small [...] -can have a very large effect. We report our findings across five categories of revisitation research: characterisations of user behaviour; system models of navigation and their impact on the user's understanding; interface methods for increasing the efficiency of the Back button; alternative system models for navigation; and alternative methods for presenting web navigation histories. The behaviour characterisation shows that revisitation is a dominant activity, with an average of four out of five page visits being to previously seen pages. It also shows that the Back button is heavily used, but poorly understood. Three interface strategies for improving web page revisitation are described. The first, a gesture-based mechanism for issuing the frequent Back and Forward commands, addresses low-level interface issues, and is shown to be both popular and effective. The second, a `temporal' behaviour for the Back and <b>Forward</b> <b>buttons,</b> aims to overcome the problems associated with poor understanding of the current behaviour of Back. Although the results do not conclusively show advantages for the temporal behaviour of Back, they strongly suggest that revisitation can be improved by providing temporally ordered lists of previously visited pages...|$|R
