5|$|In November 2014, Adam is {{revealed}} to be recovering from multiple facial reconstruction surgeries, {{and is in the}} care of Sage Warner (Kelly Sullivan). When Adam is told of Chelsea and Billy's new relationship, he attempts to leave his current dwelling, with Sage assuring him that he is not ready and that any attempt to leave would only compromise the progress of the surgeries he'd recently had. Adam eventually recovers enough to have the bandages removed from his face; after the bandages are removed it {{is revealed}} that his face had been replaced by Gabriel Bingham; the man who died saving Adam's life, he returns to Genoa City with Sage, he comes across the people he knows, but none of them recognize Adam or <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that they know him somehow. Adam, under the alias of Gabriel, would pose as being married to Sage, in a ruse to claim Gabe's inheritance from Constance, however, they would later divorce in April 2015. He would reconnect with Chelsea, whom he confessed his true identity, and would slowly begin to piece their life back together, with plans to relocate to Paris, until Victor stepped in to sue for custody of Connor, keeping them in Genoa City. In October 2015, Adam's true identity was revealed and would help Sage deliver his nephew in Chancellor Park, following a heated confrontation between the two. Adam would stand trial for his role in Delia's death. He was sentenced for ten years, and upon leaving the courthouse, was run over by an unknown assailant. Christine found out that the car is found at the south lake motel. The car was found out to be a rental and Kevin found a surveillance picture that showed that Chloe was behind the pedal to the metal. Adam regains consciousness after the surgery, and expresses no ill will towards Chloe.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} other recent {{narratives}} extolling the divinity of the goddess, which are also linked to Shirdi Sai Baba and his devotees. In one such narration, a priest of Vani village known as Kakaji Vaidya who {{was working in the}} Saptashrungi Temple was quite disturbed by the miseries of life around him and he, therefore, appealed to the goddess to give him peace of mind and relieve him from all worries. Pleased with the priest's devotion to her, the goddess appeared to him in a dream and told him to go to the Baba to set his mind at rest and in peace. As the priest was then not aware of which Baba she meant, he thought it was the Shiva at Trimabakeshwar temple and so he went there and offered worship to Shiva and stayed there for a few days. In the process, he still did not <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of peace and his restless mood continued. He came back to Vani village disheartened. Then, every day after taking bath in the morning he offered prayers to Shiva Linga by reciting Rudra mantra from the Yajurveda, for many days. He still did not get peace of mind. He then went back to the Mata temple and appealed to her to give relief to his restless mind. That night she appeared in his dream and told that the Baba she meant was Sai Samarth of Shirdi and that he should go there. The priest did not know the whereabouts of Sai Baba. Sai Baba through his divine psychic perception realised the need of the priest and so he sent his most loving devotee Madhavarao to meet the priest and bring him to his presence. Coincidentally, Madhavrao had also gone there at the advice of Baba to also offer two silver breasts to the goddess as his mother had forgotten to fulfill her vow of gifting the silver breasts to the goddess. When Madhavarao went to Vani village the priest met him and came to know that he had come from Shirdi to offer silver breast to the goddess. The priest was very pleased, and also for the first time felt peace of mind. He then took Madhavarao to the temple where the silver breasts were placed {{at the feet of the}} goddess in the sanctum as a fulfilment of his mother's vow. The priest then came to Shirdi with Madhavarao and had darshan of the Sai Baba and stayed there for 12 days and felt very peaceful. He then returned to Vani.|$|E

50|$|The dual-process account {{states that}} {{recognition}} decisions {{are based on}} the processes of recollection and familiarity. Recollection is a conscious, effortful process in which specific details of the context in which an item was encountered are retrieved. Familiarity is a relatively fast, automatic process in which one <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> item has been encountered before, but the context in which it was encountered is not retrieved. According to this view, remember responses reflect recollections of past experiences and know responses are associated with recognition on the basis of familiarity.|$|R

[...] After the Spanish film development lab discovered that telephone lines, helicopters, and cars could be seen in the footage Bakshi had shot, they tried to incinerate the footage, telling Bakshi's first assistant director that [...] "if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again." ...|$|E
500|$|Not all viewers {{were taken}} with Dalton. Jay Scott of The Globe and Mail was entirely dismissive. [...] "The new Bond {{has been widely}} {{described}} in feature stories as {{a throwback to the}} Ian Fleming original (studying the Fleming novels, Dalton was pleased to discover that Bond was a human being, he says), and that may be true, if the Fleming original lacked charm, sex appeal and wit. Timothy Dalton's Bond is a serious bloke who swallows his words and approaches his job with responsibility and humanity, and eschews promiscuity – Dirtless Harry. You <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that on his off nights, he might curl up with the Reader's Digest and catch an episode of Moonlighting – he'd try to memorize the jokes – before nodding off under the influence of Ovaltine. The British reviews of The Living Daylights have been laudatory, perhaps because this Bond is the most British of all, if British is to be understood as a synonym for reserved".|$|E

In April 2014, Gunn described Thanos as the [...] "head of the snake" [...] in the film, and confirmed he would appear via performance capture. In May 2014, Gunn stated that the film features an [...] "enormous" [...] amount of smaller and minor characters from the Marvel Universe, adding that he felt the film had the most characters overall of any Marvel Studios film to date. Costume supervisor Dan Grace added to this by saying, [...] "We really, really <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of the scale {{and scope of the}} galaxy. We visit five planets, we see a hundred different races." [...] The film introduces the alien race Sakaaran, who act as Ronan's mercenaries, as a replacement to the Badoon, as the Badoon film rights belonged to 20th Century Fox.|$|E
500|$|The {{genesis of}} Edward Scissorhands {{came from a}} drawing by then-teenaged {{director}} Tim Burton, which reflected his feelings of isolation and being unable to communicate to people around him in suburban Burbank. The drawing depicted a thin, solemn man with long, sharp blades for fingers. Burton stated that he was often alone and had trouble retaining friendships. [...] "I <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> people just got this urge to want {{to leave me alone}} for some reason, I don't know exactly why." [...] During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Burton hired Caroline Thompson, then a young novelist, to write the Edward Scissorhands screenplay as a spec script. Burton was impressed with her short novel, First Born, which was [...] "about an abortion that came back to life". Burton felt First Born had the same psychological elements he wanted to showcase in Edward Scissorhands. [...] "Every detail was so important to Tim because it was so personal", Thompson remarked. She wrote Scissorhands as a [...] "love poem" [...] to Burton, calling him [...] "the most articulate person I know, but couldn't put a single sentence together".|$|E
500|$|Rotten, meanwhile, {{suffering}} from flu and coughing up blood, felt increasingly isolated from Cook and Jones, and disgusted by Vicious. On 14 January 1978, during the tour's final date at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, a disillusioned Rotten introduced the band's encore saying, [...] "You'll get one number and one number only 'cause I'm a lazy bastard." [...] That one number was a Stooges cover, [...] "No Fun". At {{the end of}} the song, Rotten, kneeling on the stage, chanted an unambiguous declaration, [...] "This is no fun. No fun. This is no fun—at all. No fun." [...] As the final cymbal crash died away, Rotten addressed the audience directly—"Ah-ha-ha. Ever <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> you've been cheated? Good night"—before throwing down his microphone and walking offstage. He later observed, [...] "I felt cheated, and I wasn't going on with it any longer; it was a ridiculous farce. Sid was completely out of his brains—just a waste of space. The whole thing was a joke at that point.... wouldn't speak to me.... He would not discuss anything with me.

500|$|... "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. While reviewing Femme Fatale, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted Spears [...] "does what pop stars invariably do {{in lieu of}} having a detectable character of their own: {{goes on and on}} about sex", while commenting that [...] "after a while, you <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> the lyricists just gave up trying in the face of her indifference: 'You got me kind of hot … Steaming like a pot full of vegetables,' she sings, which somehow makes you think not of thrillingly sweaty congress but the smell of boiled cabbage." [...] Contemporary critic Robert Christgau noted the songs on the album are [...] "such a convincing illusion that any guy who goes all the way with it has too much libido invested in the bimbo fantasy", saying that the singer is [...] "just too straight-faced" [...] on [...] "the nauseous 'Your body look so sick I think I got the flu'". A reviewer of Samesame.com.au compared the background vocals of the song to Kesha's [...] "Blow" [...] (2010), and noted [...] "guest rapper Sabi wish she was Nicki Minaj".

500|$|Monica Herrera of Billboard {{gave the}} single a mixed review, stating that Minaj, being [...] "one {{of the most}} {{visually}} distinctive rappers to come along in years", that the single was an [...] "anticlimatic coming out song", [...] "considering the hype Minaj has generated through mixtapes, cameos and her co-starring role in Lil Wayne's Young Money project". However Hererra did commend the lyrical content, stating [...] "her sassy one-liners are as entertaining as always", and the overall production although it didn't suit Minaj's [...] "her mental-patient delivery nearly as well as, say, Kane Beatz' simpler track for Young Money's [...] "BedRock". Robbie Daw of 'Idolator' said, [...] "we wouldn’t expect Nicki to do any less than {{come out of the}} gate charging full force, lyrically, on her debut single. That said, we were expecting maybe a tad more of a melody on the track." [...] Chris Ryan of 'MTV Buzzworthy' gave the song a positive review, stating [...] "you <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling,</b> listening to the song's air-raid keyboards and thunderous beats, that the Young Money princess really wants to separate herself from the rap pack and carve out a space all her own". Ryan also said, [...] "her verbal dexterity, complex flow and humor, Nicki is reminiscent of classic Missy Elliott -- and that's a compliment of the highest order".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{likened the}} episode to Seinfeld and Ellen; Tom Feran in The Plain Dealer wrote that it traded [...] "vaguely and less {{successfully}} on the hanging-out style of Seinfeld", and Ann Hodges of the Houston Chronicle called it [...] "the new Seinfeld wannabe, {{but it will}} never be as funny as Seinfeld. Even as Seinfeld is now, which isn't as funny as it used to be". Hodges criticized the [...] "stiflingly dull social circle" [...] as [...] "short to the point of painful in brainpower". Robert Bianco in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that the [...] "constant comic bantering grows a little tired, just as it would if it ever actually happened in real life", and questioned why the six characters had so much free time to talk about dates. In the Los Angeles Daily News, Ray Richmond, who had also seen the following two episodes, called the cast a [...] "likeable, youth ensemble" [...] with [...] "good chemistry". He added that while Friends was [...] "one of the brighter comedies of the new season", the pilot was [...] "very weak". Diane Holloway for the Austin American-Statesman questioned Friends billing as a [...] "sophisticated comedy", writing, [...] "What's sophisticated about a guy who dreams his penis is a telephone?" [...] She called the scene where Monica discovers Paul's impotence was a lie the least funny part of the episode, though conceded that the episode as a whole did have some funny moments. [...] Robert P. Laurence wrote in The San Diego Union-Tribune that [...] "A lot happens, but you'll still <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> you've seen Friends before", calling it [...] "Seinfeld Plus Two. Or Ellen Plus Five." [...] In the Chicago Sun-Times, Ginny Holbert rated the episode three stars, and wrote [...] "The clever series [...] stars an appealing group of actors who are just a bit funnier and better-looking than your average friend" [...] but that Joey and Rachel's characteristics were under-developed.|$|E
