40|$|In {{the face}} of the {{extensive}} changes resulting from the Post-Industrial Age, many are questioning "the gifts of the chip," or, more specifically, the ability of computer technologies to deliver the comfort predicted. The objective of this thesis is to examine the law's response to computer technology concerning occupational health and safety. This inquiry is necessary due to the dramatic changes that have occurred in the workforce, altering the profile of workplace health. The thesis begins with a reference to The Gift of Stones, a fictional account of the difficulties that stone workers experienced when the Bronze Age arrived. Modern labourers face parallel struggles due to the arrival of the Post-Industrial Age characterized by technological innovation and restructuring. The legitimacy and effectiveness of occupational health and safety law is challenged by changes to social institutions and by computer related work injuries. In many jurisdictions, the state has responded to these changes by enacting <b>ergonomic</b> <b>standards</b> that seek to minimize the harmful effects of computer use. The thesis examines the trend towards <b>ergonomic</b> <b>standards</b> with particular focus on Canadian initiatives. In conclusion, it argues that ergonomic regulations are an important means of promoting safer computer practices. Additionally, <b>ergonomic</b> <b>standards</b> provide a mechanism for continued state regulation of occupational health and safety.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of the ergonomic performance of 13 harvesting machine models was assessed from an ergonomic viewpoint. The main objective {{of the study was}} to compare ergonomic performance to harvesting machine operators’ work and propose viable solutions to improve the work environment. The principal assessed ergonomic requirements were operators’ workspace, operators’ seats, visibility, work postures, whole-body vibration and noise in the cab, all as related to the tasks involved in typical harvesting cycles. Altogether, more than 120 different parameters that impact ergonomics and work conditions were measured directly at workplaces in the actual working conditions. The results were then compared to the effective norms and the degree of compliance with the stipulated values was determined. The obtained estimates for the degree of compliance were integrated. This permits a direct {{comparison of}} the work-load on operators with a single integrated indicator (severity). In many respects the <b>ergonomic</b> <b>standard</b> is now good, except for skidders. Visibility and work postures were considered to be the most critical features influencing the operator’s performance. Even in highly mechanized harvesting work, problems still exist despite extensive development of cabs. The best working conditions in terms of harvesting systems were provided by »harvester + forwarder« in cut-to-length harvesting and »feller buncher + grapple skidder« in full-tree harvesting. The traditional Russian tree-length harvesting done with cable skidders showed the worst results in terms of ergonomics. When a partially mechanized harvesting system is employed, use of cable skidders should be as limited as possible, because, as a whole, they do not comply with the present ergonomic requirements...|$|E

BackgroundThe RNLE has been used extensively as a risk assessment method for prevention of low back pain (LBP). However, {{the impact of the}} RNLE has not been documented. MethodsA systematic review of the literature on the RNLE was conducted. The review consisted of three parts: characterization of the RNLE publications; assessment {{of the impact of the}} RNLE; and evaluation of the influences of the RNLE on ergonomic standards. The literature for assessing the impact was categorized into four research areas: methodology, laboratory, field and risk assessment studies using the Lifting Index (LI) or Composite LI (CLI), both of which are the products of the RNLE. ResultsThe impact of the RNLE has been both widespread and influential. We found 24 studies that examined the criteria used to define lifting capacity used by the RNLE, 28 studies that compared risk assessment methods for identifying LBP, 23 studies that found the RNLE useful in identifying the risk of LBP with different work populations, and 13 studies on the relationship between LI/CLI and LBP outcomes. We also found evidence on the adoption of the RNLE as an <b>ergonomic</b> <b>standard</b> for use by various local, state, and international entities. ConclusionThe review found 13 studies that link LI/CLI to adverse LBP outcomes. These studies showed a positive relationship between LI/CLI metrics and the severity of LBP outcomes.

40|$|AbstractAn {{occupational}} {{health and safety}} management standard must be designed to ensure a planned and coordinated approach to managing health and safety risks in the workplace. It should include procedures for preventing injuries and illness, and for managing the quick return to work of injured police employees. In law enforcement organisations, ergonomic aspects and safety issues must be tackled with three priorities that are essential for that occupation: officer safety, public safety and avoidance of litigation. Therefore, police officers provide their own safety, protect the citizens and {{try to make sure that}} their actions do not create litigation against themselves or their organisation. The equipment and workstations designed for the law enforcement personnel to support these priorities has to be effective, safe and reliable. After implementing an effective <b>ergonomic</b> <b>standard,</b> the Romanian Police should significantly reduce work related injury rates, along with their severity and associated costs. While we do not know exactly how many police organisations offer {{occupational health}} and safety programs or what programs they offer, we do know that, in general, the law enforcement field could significantly benefit from adopting a comprehensive health and safety standard. This paper suggests the implementation of a comprehensive health and safety design standard in police organisations in order to manage properly some ergonomic stressors in police activity and some possible solutions have been proposed. A questionnaire survey was performed on a population of 50 police officers to assess levels of strain associated with a series of potential home and work related stressors. Participants were split into two scoring groups, operative and non-operative officers, on the basis of a general ergonomic checklist in order to identify those stressors...|$|E

As {{in the most}} part of the world, in Latvia also conventional "Qwerty" keyboard is used. Though for Latvian it is much worse than for English, especially due to enormous load to little fingers. It causes repetitive strain injuries and affects productivity of workers with extensive keyboard usage, especially for data input operators, call centers, inquiry office workers, etc. Improving computer keyboard layout decrease stress to hands and fingers thus minimizing exhaustion and injuries. With analysis of English and Latvian public domain novels and modern texts, letter appearance an sequence distribution for Latvian language was found. Qualities of alternative layouts for English (Dvorak, Colemak, Hallinstad) were investigated and open source carpalx simulation tool was adjusted according to the findings. Then carpalx was used to check more than 25 million keyboard layouts, measuring finger/hand effort, stroke typing convenience etc., {{to find the best}} one. It was proved that existing "Šusildatec" (classic Latvian <b>Ergonomic</b> <b>standard)</b> keyboard is only slightly better than "Qwerty" for Latvian, though it is much worse for English. After computer simulation, several best layouts were tried practically for more than 6 months and most convenient one was promoted as a new "Latvian Modern" keyboard. Its typing effort is less than for "Šusildatec", load is distributed according to finger strength, and typing strokes are alternating better between hands and fingers. Comparing to "Qwerty" keyboard new layout is better not only for Latvian but for English also.

40|$|Cet article examine la réglementation adoptée par cinq administrations publiques en Amérique du Nord qui ont choisi de {{faire appel}} à la science de l’ergonomie comme outil réglementaire de prévention des {{troubles}} musculo-squelettiques (TMS). Aux États-Unis, seul le règlement de la Californie, d’une portée fort limitée, a pu survivre aux pressions politiques qui ont mené à l’abrogation des règlements de l’État fédéral américain (OSHA) et de l’État de Washington. Au Canada, la Colombie-Britannique et la Saskatchewan appliquent de tels règlements, mais contrairement aux instruments américains abrogés, ceux du Canada misent plutôt sur le processus de prise en charge que sur des normes spécifiques qui quantifient les gestes à risque et déterminent de façon stricte les actions attendues de l’employeur. La description du contexte d’adoption et du contenu des règlements est ensuite suivie d’une comparaison sommaire de cette réglementation avec le droit québécois régissant la prévention des TMS. This article examines five ergonomic standards adopted by regulatory agencies in North America {{for the purpose}} of preventing musculo-skeletal disorders (MSDs), one of the most costly categories of injury throughout North America. Since 1988, three regulatory agencies in the United States and two in Canada have chosen to implement “ergonomic standards”, relying on knowledge produced by the science of ergonomy to prevent injury associated with various risk factors known to contribute to MSDs. Saskatchewan was the first to regulate the prevention of MSDs in 1988, followed by California (1997), British Columbia (1998), Washington State (2000) and OSHA (2001). While the first three regulations are still in force, political pressure by business lobbies led to the repeal of both the OSHA regulation, repealed shortly after the Bush cabinet came to power, only weeks after its adoption, and the Washington State regulation, repealed {{as a result of a}} referendum in late 2003. The article first situates ergonomic standards in the historical context of occupational health and safety regulation. Gunningham and Johnstone (Regulating Workplace Safety: Systems and Sanctions, Oxford University Press, 1999), in a historical overview of regulatory strategies in occupational health and safety, show that, in many Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions, the traditional approach of command and control regulation, based on a multitude of technical specifications, has evolved into a performance based approach, relying on general duty clauses and codes of practice while placing less reliance on technical specifications. The third and most recent regulatory approach, relying on process regulation and occupational health and safety management systems, has developed considerably in Europe but has not yet taken hold in most North American jurisdictions. The historical overview allows us to consider why the various ergonomic standards studied have led to so much controversy, particularly in the United States, as tensions arose as those who preferred stringent regulation of ergonomic hazards met with very strong resistance from business interests, many of whom were determined to prevent any form of regulation relying on ergonomy. The nature and outcomes of the political confrontation in the different jurisdictions are then examined. The article then describes the regulatory framework of each of the five standards studied. The most timid is that of California, targeting only the prevention of “repetitive motion injuries”, constraining the employer only after at least two workers are injured in the same job, and presuming employer response to be adequate. All the other regulations are broader in scope, aiming to prevent all forms of musculo-skeletal disorders, ensuring that all employers undertake some form of risk assessment and providing, in different ways, specific tools to facilitate detection of hazardous working conditions. OSHA and Washington State regulations rely on a quantitative approach, specifying in detail different forms of ergonomic risks. The Canadian regulations are more process based, ensuring that employers do a risk assessment and relying on training and the provision of information to workers and unions without prescribing a quantified standard, but only the procedures to be followed. Tables show the different steps to be followed under each regulation (Table 1) and the different risk factors to be examined (Table 2). An examination of the role reserved for different actors in the prevention process (Table 3) shows that ergonomists themselves are not specifically named in any of the regulations. The designation of these standards as “ergonomic” is based on their reliance on knowledge gleaned from the study of ergonomy, yet the fact that these North American regulations only look to prevent MSDs shows that many other teachings of ergonomy are completely overlooked. After describing the five regulatory instruments that rely explicitly on ergonomy, the article examines the situation in Quebec. The Occupational health and safety regulation contains a few specific obligations that have existed for years, including the obligation to provide chairs, when feasible, and a few conditions applicable to manual handling and the placement of tools. The Quebec inspectorate of the Commission de la santé et de la sécurité du travail (CSST) also relies on the general duty clause to implement change in the workplace with regards to ergonomy. It is unclear whether this approach has met with success, and a few administrative tribunal judgments lead us to believe that an <b>ergonomic</b> <b>standard</b> would ensure a more flexible approach that would encourage employers, unions and workers to act promptly to implement strategies designed to prevent MSDs. An <b>ergonomic</b> <b>standard</b> would also facilitate the work of inspectors while allowing them to encourage the employer to undertake risk assessments and prevention programmes. In conclusion, a number of issues are raised concerning the appropriate regulatory approach that will ensure the prevention of MSDs and also introduce an ergonomic approach to occupational health and safety prevention strategies. Critics suggest that an approach based only on specifications will never adequately prevent MSDs, as the variability of individual morphology escapes quantification. Others suggest that without specifications, enforcement becomes impracticable. The American experience, as compared to the Canadian, leads us to conclude that a more harmonious regulatory process is necessary to guarantee the efficacy, and the survival of ergonomic standards.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} ergonomics in a Base Metal Refinery (BMR). The hypothesis tested was that the machinery and equipment used and the postures of the workers and the load handled are not in line with good <b>ergonomic</b> <b>standards</b> and practices. Anthropometrical measurements were taken from 11 1 workers and the loads they handled, their posture while performing the work and the heights of different workstations. Self administered questionnaires were completed by all the workers so as to determine how the feel about their work and an observational data was recorded in order to observe the way the work was performed. Different anthropometrical measurements taken included stature, weight, vertical grip reach, forward grip reach, shoulder grip length, shoulder height/hip height. Different variables including height of the workstation, weight handled, type of work done and frequency of handling were also measured. Evaluation of medical records and incident reports were also carried out to determine whether these records support the hypothesis to be tested or not. Most of the workstations were not ergonomically designed and the work performed in the Base Metal Refinery was done in a standing position and repeated for most of the work shifts. Anthropometrical data was collected so as it can be compared with the type of work performed the duration of the work and whether the workstations were designed to fit the workers. Workers in the BMR were exposed to handling loads which were higher than the NIOSH recommended weight of 23 kg, the work was highly repetitive and the workers had to bend awkwardly while performing the work. Therefore this disagrees with the hypothesis which states that the machinery and equipment used and the postures of the workers and the load handled was not in line with good <b>ergonomic</b> <b>standards</b> and practices. This statement was also supported by the incidents reports and the medical records which showed that most workers were booked for a long time due to lower back pain, and more incidents occurred due to handling loads. In BMR most incidents, injuries and illnesses were common amongst cell workers than any occupation within the industry. High incidents and absenteeism due to lower back related illnesses can be directly associated to the type of work performed and the amount of load handled. Most of the workstations were either too high or too low therefore forcing the workers to bend at the waist or his neck so as to properly observe the task, and this proves that BMR was not designed to fit the workers, the way the work was performed, the posture of the worker, the repetitive nature of the work and the weight handled were exceeding the <b>ergonomic</b> <b>standards</b> and practices.

ISO (through working group TC 159 /SC 4 /WG 9) is developing international standards in this subject area, dual-tracked as both ISO and CEN standards. A framework and guidelines for tactile/haptic interactions have recently been published as ISO 9241 - 910 and ISO 9241 - 920 respectively. We describe the main concepts and definitions {{in support of a}} new standard that describes how to evaluate tactile/haptic interactions and how to link this evaluation to previous standards. The new standard addresses three major aspects of the evaluation of a tactile/haptic system ̶ the validation of system requirements, the verification that the system meets the requirements, and the overall usability of the system. Several measurement and analysis techniques are discussed, such as the calculation of scores for the determination of effectiveness. Tactile/haptic measurements have to be repeatable, and as an example we discuss how an appropriate model of the interaction with a virtual wall can be formed and used in evaluating a device...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of ergonomics’ recommendations, guidelines and standards are attempts {{to promote the}} integration of ergonomics into industrial contexts. Such developments result from several sources and professionals and represent the effort {{that has been done}} to develop healthier and safer work environments. However, the availability of large amount of data and documents regarding ergonomics does not guarantee their applicability. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} use a specific case to demonstrate how ergonomics criteria were developed in order to contribute to the design of workplaces. Based on the obtained results from research undertaken in a tire company, it was observed that the ergonomics criteria should be presented as design specifications in order to be used by engineers and designers. In conclusion, it is observed that the multiple constraint environment impeded the appliance of the ergonomics criteria. It was also observed that the knowledge on technical design and the acquaintance with <b>ergonomic</b> <b>standards,</b> the level of integration in the design team, and the ability to communicate with workers and other technical staff have paramount importance in integrating ergonomics criteria into the design process...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Identify the {{prevalence}} of Repetitive Strain Injuries/Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders in dentists of different specialties from Porto Velho, Rondônia, Brazil. METHODS: A questionnaire about personal and professional informations and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire, that has questions about movement difficulty, pain symptoms, weakness, stiffness, paresthesia and psychological and sleep impairment related to last week, was given to 200 dentists from Porto Velho city. However, 100 of them gave back the questionnaires appropriately answered within the time limit, consisting of 100 dentists the sample of this study. The collected data was analyzed by simple descriptive statistics and the Spearman nonparametric correlation test was applied between independent variables and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire disabilities measures, considering p< 0. 05. RESULTS: The questionnaire disability average was "excellent" for the general sample, but it was found statistical correlation between upper disability measurements and two variables: short time in profession (less than ten years) and the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Implantology and Stomatology specialties. CONCLUSION: It is necessary the dentists that are specialists in these areas and the newly graduated ones do a self-assessment and {{find out if they}} are neglecting <b>ergonomic</b> <b>standards</b> so they can follow them...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to {{evaluate}} whether the crushing and screening products of Metso comply to the new safety standard which is being drafted by the European committee for standardization (CEN). Evolution of the technology and inability of the person to adapt to those technology, always demands {{an update on the}} prevailing safety features. The need for a new set of standard is the mere demand to create a balance between the advancement in the technology and safety of the users. The target of the thesis was to highlight the requirement for revisions in the product development process of the machinery to comply with the new standard if required. The document has been prepared based on the draft of the new standard prEn 1009 series which is under continuous amendment. Screening machine ST 2. 8 and Crushing machine LT 330 D were the subject of study. The scope of the thesis was to study and analyze the maintenance tasks related to screening part of the machine and suggest the required change to make it compatible with the new standard. The screen replacement procedure has been studied and analyzed for the safety requirements. The conclusion and suggestions has been drawn based on the literature review and screen replacement videos provided. The safety of the users and the environment has been always considered while designing the machine. The general <b>standards,</b> <b>ergonomic</b> <b>standards,</b> inspection standards and maintenance standards related to safety are followed during the product development of Metso products. The information for use has been provided in detail to the users and warning signs and use of protective overalls have been suggested in relevant places. The safety requirements set in the new standard are obeyed to a remarkable level but since the standard is under continuous amendment it is advised to revise the requirements for the machine once it is finalized...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} assess {{different}} types of machines adapted for mechanized forest harvesting activities in order to quantify the degree of compliance with ergonomic principles applicable to forest machines, {{as well as the}} ergonomic risks to which workers are exposed. The following machines were evaluated: a feller buncher adapted into a wheel loader; a mini skidder coupled to an agricultural tractor; and a forest loader adapted to an agricultural tractor; operating in the states of Paraná and Minas Gerais. Biomechanical working conditions were assessed by applying a checklist for simplified assessment of the workplace biomechanical conditions. The forced postures assessment was performed using the REBA - "Rapid Entire Body Assessment" method. In turn, ergonomic classification was through guidelines contained in the ergonomic classification manual "Ergonomic Guidelines for Forest Machines". Moreover, the environmental factors noise, temperature and vibration to which the operators of these machines were exposed were assessed. The results showed all assessed machines had <b>ergonomic</b> <b>standards</b> below those indicated in all assessed aspects, mainly related to access and dimensions of the workplace, need to adopt forced postures during working hours, and exposure to environmental factors assessed above tolerance limits. It is concluded that machines adapted for use in forest harvesting processes have shown significant gaps in relation to ergonomic aspects, presenting high and imminent risk of development of occupational diseases in their operators...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assist Silas Hopper, {{a child with}} spina bifida, with getting into his {{wheelchair}} independently when being on the ground, the senior project team set out to construct a device that would fulfill that purpose. They did this through {{coming up with a}} strict definition of the problem to be solved, designing a number of potential solutions for the problem, prototyping to determine the feasibility of the solutions, making design modifications after testing the prototype, and building the final device. The end product was a device that was able to operate mechanically, with a design that considered safety and <b>ergonomic</b> <b>standards.</b> The estimated material cost of the device was $ 265, not counting labor or machinery. Testing yielded that Silas was able to use the device independently and successfully to move from the ground to his wheelchair seat. This had great implications for the lives of both Silas and his parents. After completing further modifications like adding a motor, dual button system to control the motor, and safety coverings to the device, it will be given to Silas permanently. The team hoped that awareness would be brought to spina bifida through the completion of this project, so future senior project groups or companies could use some of the lessons learned during this project and apply them to further improving the lives of those affected with spina bifida...|$|R
