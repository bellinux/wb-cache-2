50|$|Kitchen Table International was {{a fictitious}} {{computer}} company {{created as a}} faux amalgam of Radio Shack, Apple Inc., Commodore Business Machines, and other organizations of the time, and {{was the subject of}} one of the earliest regular computer humor columns, appearing in Wayne Green’s 80 Micro magazine from January 1980 through July, 1983. Invented by computer journalist David D. Busch, and billed as the “world’s leading supplier of fictitious hardware, software, firmware, and limpware” each month a new “innovation” was introduced that poked fun at the infant personal computer industry. These included a “black phosphor” computer monitor, and a programming language with all the worst features of BASIC and COBOL, called BASBOL. The fictional company’s flagship product was the TLS-8E, a computer which was sold with a factory-applied coating of oxidation on its peripheral <b>edge</b> <b>card</b> connectors (“to protect them from electricity”), a 5-inch “sloppy” disk drive, and a keyboard that eschewed the familiar QWERTY array for a 16-key matrix that included a TBA (To Be Announced) key.|$|E
