This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} an audit of community <b>tourism</b> <b>projects</b> that were invested in, in the Eastern Cape {{as part of}} government intervention to create job opportunities {{and contribute to the}} growth of the Eastern Cape economy through the tourism industry. The focus is on projects that received capital allocations for infrastructural development rather than operational costs. The study sought to achieve the following objectives: • Determine the status quo of publicly funded capital <b>tourism</b> <b>projects</b> developed since 2004. • Determine the modus operandi followed with regard to capital <b>tourism</b> <b>projects.</b> • Determine the reasons for the successes or failures of these projects. • Provide recommendations to address gaps and failures in <b>tourism</b> <b>projects.</b> The key informants to the study were steering committees that were established to implement community <b>tourism</b> <b>projects.</b> The steering committees are represented by government officials (local, provincial and national), consultants and community trusts or any community structure that represents the broader community. The study revealed three types of community projects, namely: • Projects that are operational – although there are projects operating, the number is insignificant and it is unlikely that they would achieve the objectives that they were built for. The overall operational status does not warrant the R 500 m that was invested by government. • Projects that operated before but closed hence, referred to as ‘white elephants’ – {{there are a number of}} projects that were in business but currently closed due to poor management and lack of skills. • Projects that were under planning during the survey – these are projects that have been under planning for a very long time...|$|R

40|$|AN EVALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR RURAL TOURISM PROJECTS: A RESPONDENT PERSPECTIVE This study formulates a {{proposed}} {{framework for the}} evaluation of rural <b>tourism</b> <b>projects.</b> Specifically it attempts to establish the role of the public sector in the governance and management of rural tourism; to develop an index of criteria against which rural <b>tourism</b> <b>projects</b> can be evaluated; to suggest how such evaluation could be implemented; and to establish with whom the responsibility for the management of the evaluation process should rest. A Delphi Survey comprising 60 panellists from Britain and South Africa, a focus group held in South Africa and eighteen semi-structured interviews conducted in South Africa and Britain were utilised in developing the evaluation framework. A panel of experts, drawn from the academic, public, consultant and operational sectors, have consensually developed an index comprising criteria pertaining both to the macro-impact of rural <b>tourism</b> <b>projects</b> on the host environment and to micro issues impacting the commercial success of individual <b>tourism</b> <b>projects.</b> Respondents indicate that the public sector has a pivotal role in guiding and supporting the creation of an environment conducive {{to the development of the}} rural tourism sector. This role is envisaged as most compelling at local government level. Although the onus {{for the evaluation of}} rural <b>tourism</b> <b>projects</b> is perceived to rest with local authorities, lack of capacity at this level was identified as a major constraint. There is evidence that rural tourism operators generally lack business and operational capacity and that training is a vital element in ensuring the commercial success of the sector. In recognising the value of the concept of utilisation-focused evaluation as a tool for building capacity and generating information for utilisation by project operators and local authorities alike, the study suggests its adoption at the individual project level as an integral element of the rural tourism development process...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTourism is {{destructive}} toward host {{communities and}} their natural environment. However, the general attitude of society {{toward the environment}} is hanging, and consequently, people are developing {{an appreciation for the}} value of responsible travel. Alternative forms of tourism have been conceived, such as ecotourism, and are viewed as a mean to meet the expectations of the new tourists. Ecotourism is a method to satisfy the concern of new tourists for environmental conservation but it neglects one of the key factors of sustainable tourism today: the host communities. Community-based ecotourism aims at environmental conservation {{but it is also a}} way to empower communities, by allowing them a degree of control over <b>tourism</b> <b>projects</b> and their impacts. This article reveals the varying degrees of empowerment of host communities provided by community-based ecotourism through a metastudy analysis of six case studies of <b>tourism</b> <b>projects.</b> Not all contemporary <b>tourism</b> <b>projects</b> take local populations into consideration thus the six case studies are nonrandom selections for the purpose of representing the concept embodied in the thesis and showing its appropriateness with the new tourists' expectations...|$|R
40|$|The Kichwa Añangu Community {{lives in}} Ecuador's Yasuní National Park. As a community, {{they have chosen}} to {{dedicate}} their livelihood to community-owned tourism, or what is commonly called turismo comunitario in Ecuador. Tourism brings multiple, ongoing challenges to the Añangu Community. Shifting market demands, growing regional and transnational competition, and large-scale climate events each present ongoing vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the Añangu do not own rights to the petroleum reserves quietly resting under their land. Nonetheless, they persist in their <b>tourism</b> <b>project</b> and have become recognized {{as a model for}} community-owned tourism in Ecuador. In part, this thesis seeks to explore why the Añangu Community has chosen to not only pursue, but expand their involvement in community-owned tourism. This research will demonstrate that tourism is locally embraced as a vehicle for livelihood wellbeing, environmental stewardship, and cultural reclamation. The key question then becomes, why is the Añangu Community’s <b>tourism</b> <b>project</b> successful?
