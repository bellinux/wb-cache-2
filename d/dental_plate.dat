500|$|Colin Clive and Boris Karloff reprised {{their roles}} from Frankenstein as creator and creation, respectively. Hobson {{recalled}} Clive's alcoholism had worsened since filming the original, but Whale did not recast the role because his [...] "hysterical quality" [...] {{was necessary for}} the film. Karloff strongly objected to the decision to allow the Monster to speak. [...] "Speech! Stupid! My argument was that if the monster had any impact or charm, {{it was because he}} was inarticulate– this great, lumbering, inarticulate creature. The moment he spoke you might as well... play it straight." [...] This decision also meant that Karloff could not remove his <b>dental</b> <b>plate,</b> so now his cheeks did not have the sunken look of the original film. Whale and the studio psychiatrist selected 44 simple words for the Monster's vocabulary by looking at test papers of ten-year-olds working at the studio. Dwight Frye returned to play the doctor's assistant, Karl, having played the hunchback Fritz in the original. Frye also filmed a scene as an unnamed villager and the role of [...] "Nephew Glutz", a man who murdered his uncle and blamed the death on the Monster. Boris Karloff is credited simply as KARLOFF, which was Universal's custom during the height of his career. Elsa Lanchester is credited for Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, but in a nod to the earlier film, the Monster's bride is credited only as [...] "?"

2500|$|In Hudson v. McMillian, a {{prisoner}} had been beaten, garnering a cracked lip, broken <b>dental</b> <b>plate,</b> loosened teeth, cuts, and bruises. Although {{these were not}} [...] "serious injuries", the court believed, it held that [...] "the use of excessive physical force against {{a prisoner}} may constitute {{cruel and unusual punishment}} even though the inmate does not suffer serious injury." [...] Dissenting, Thomas wrote that, in his view, [...] "a use of force that causes only insignificant harm to a prisoner may be immoral, it may be tortious, it may be criminal, and it may even be remediable under other provisions of the Federal Constitution, but it is not 'cruel and unusual punishment'. In concluding to the contrary, the Court today goes far beyond our precedents." [...] Thomas's vote—in one of his first cases after joining the court—was an early example of his willingness to be the sole dissenter (Scalia later joined the opinion). Thomas's opinion was criticized by the seven-member majority of the court, which wrote that, by comparing physical assault to other prison conditions such as poor prison food, Thomas's opinion ignored [...] "the concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency that animate the Eighth Amendment". According to historian David Garrow, Thomas's dissent in Hudson was a [...] "classic call for federal judicial restraint, reminiscent of views that were held by Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II a generation earlier, but editorial criticism rained down on him". Thomas would later respond to the accusation [...] "that I supported the beating of prisoners in that case. Well, one must either be illiterate or fraught with malice to reach that conclusion… no honest reading can reach such a conclusion." ...|$|E

50|$|E. cirrhatus are bottom feeders and {{are known}} to eat their prey from the inside out. Their diet mainly {{consists}} of carrion, although they prey on live animals as well. Hagfish {{play an important role}} in the ecosystem, recycling nutrients contained in carcasses that sink to the sea floor. As the hagfish are practically blind except for their sensitivity to light they rely on the 6 sensory barbels that surround their mouths to find their way along the ocean floor and their singular nasal passageway to smell out their prey. Hagfish have a unique <b>dental</b> <b>plate</b> inside of their mouths with a row of posterior and anterior keratinous grasping teeth on each side. This <b>dental</b> <b>plate</b> folds bilaterally helping with the grasping motion hagfish use to eat their prey. The <b>dental</b> <b>plate</b> protrudes out and folds onto the flesh of the prey and then retracts back into the hagfish’s mouth. It may also use its slime to suffocate its prey though this is mostly used as a defense against predators. The moment a predator grasps a hagfish it will project slime out of its pores, causing the predator to choke. The slime clogs the gills and therefore restricts the rate at which the predator can circulate water to breathe.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} about 50 cm long. The species changes its {{appearance}} greatly {{during the transition}} to adulthood. Juveniles of the species are typically a mottled orangish-brown, with some pink shading. Adult males of the species are shades of blue or green, and have pink lines radiating from their eyes. Adult females are mottled brown and their eyes bulge out slightly. Its jaws consist of pebble-like teeth fused into a beak for eating seaweed, but in juveniles the teeth are not yet fully fused and are visible {{on the outside of}} the <b>dental</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hagfish {{have also}} been {{observed}} actively hunting the red bandfish, Cepola haastii, in its burrow, possibly using their slime to suffocate the fish before grasping it with their <b>dental</b> <b>plates</b> and dragging it from the burrow.|$|R
50|$|The {{dentition}} of the lungfish is unusual: two incisors, {{restricted to}} the upper jaw, are flat, slightly bent, and denticulated on the hind margin. These are followed by <b>dental</b> <b>plates</b> on {{the upper and lower}} jaws.|$|R
50|$|The {{variety of}} shapes {{probably}} represents function rather than ontogeny.

50|$|Like {{all other}} arthrodires, Coccosteus had a joint between the armour {{of the body}} and skull. In addition, it also had an {{internal}} joint between its neck vertebrae and the back of the skull, allowing for the mouth to be opened even wider. Along with the longer jaws, this allowed Coccosteus to feed on fairly large prey. The up-and-down movement of the skull also allowed for more water to be pumped through the gills. Possibly, the creature supplemented its diet with organic material filtered from mud using the gills. As with all other arthrodires, Coccosteus had bony <b>dental</b> <b>plates</b> embedded in its jaws, forming a beak. The beak was kept sharp by having the edges of the <b>dental</b> <b>plates</b> grind away at each other. Overall the creature looked similar to its gigantic cousin Dunkleosteus, save that its eyes were closer to the end of its snout than in its larger relative.|$|R
50|$|The cownose ray feeds upon clams, oysters, hard {{clams and}} other invertebrates. It uses two {{modified}} fins on its front side to produce suction, which {{allows it to}} draw food into its mouth, where it crushes its food with its <b>dental</b> <b>plates.</b> Cownose rays typically swim in groups, which allows them to use their synchronized wing flaps to stir up sediment and expose buried clams and oysters.|$|R
50|$|Pierce had a {{reputation}} for being bad-tempered, or at least extremely stern, but his relationship with Karloff was a good one. They both cooperated on the design of the now iconic make-up, with Karloff removing a <b>dental</b> <b>plate</b> to create an indentation {{on one side of the}} Monster's face. He also endured four hours of make-up under Pierce's hand each day, during which time his head was built up with cotton, collodion and gum, and green greasepaint (designed to look pale on black-and-white film) was applied to his face and hands. The finished product was universally acclaimed, and has since become the commonly accepted visual representation of Mary Shelley's creation. The Mummy, produced the following year, combines the plot of Dracula with the make-up tricks of Frankenstein, to turn Karloff into an incredibly aged and wrinkled Egyptian prince. Again, Pierce and Karloff's collaboration was critically acclaimed and impressed audiences. Interestingly, that same year, Pierce designed the Satanic make-up for Lugosi in White Zombie, although this was an independent film, rather than a Universal production.|$|E
5000|$|To {{achieve the}} effects of Sebastian being invisible, Bacon was {{digitally}} removed from the footage and each scene was shot twice: once with the actors and once without, for the background {{to be able to}} be seen through Sebastian's body. The crew used a motion-control camera, to ensure the same movements were achieved and the shots were then composited in post-production. For scenes where Sebastian was outlined in smoke, water and blood, Bacon wore a latex body suit, face mask, contact lenses and a <b>dental</b> <b>plate</b> all of one color; green was used for blood, blue for smoke, and black for water. Visual effects supervisor Craig Hayes then replaced Bacon with a digital clone to form an outline of his performance. To make the clone appear more like Bacon, information about [...] "every aspect" [...] of his body was recorded and the entirety of his body, including his genitals, were scanned into a computer. This special-effect performance ensured Hayes a nomination to an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, but he lost it to Gladiator.|$|E
5000|$|Hyatt {{was born}} in Starkey, New York, and began working as a printer when he was 16. Later, he became an inventor, {{receiving}} several hundred patents. Aided by his brother Isaiah, he experimented with Parkesine, a hardened form of nitrocellulose, while researching a substitute for ivory to produce billiard balls. Parkesine had been invented by the English Alexander Parkes in 1862, and is considered the first true plastic, {{although it was not}} a success as a commercial or industrial product. Liquid nitrocellulose, or collodion, had been used as early as 1851 by another English inventor, Frederick Scott Archer, in photographic applications; it had also been used extensively as a quick-drying film to protect the fingertips of printers. Hyatt's eventual result was a commercially viable way of producing solid, stable nitrocellulose, which he patented in the United States in 1869 as [...] "Celluloid" [...] (US patent 50359; now a genericized trademark). In 1870 Hyatt formed the Albany <b>Dental</b> <b>Plate</b> Company to produce, among other things, billiard balls, false teeth, and piano keys, Hyatt’s Celluloid Manufacturing Company was established in Albany, New York in 1872 and moved to Newark, New Jersey in 1873.|$|E

It has a broad head with wide-set eyes, {{and a pair of}} distinctive lobes on its subrostral fin. It also has a set of <b>dental</b> <b>plates</b> designed for crushing clams and oyster shells. When threatened the cownose ray can use the barb at the base of its tail to defend itself from the threat.|$|R

There are very few reported cases in which an ingested foreign body penetrated the gastrointestinal tract and was embedded in the pancreas. We herein report a case of laparoscopic removal of an ingested fish bone that was embedded into the pancreas.|$|R

5000|$|Surgery is {{performed}} under {{the effect of}} general anesthesia. The correct position of the patient is mandatory for the ideal introduction of laryngoscope. Preferably the patient should lie flat {{on the operating table}} without any head ring or sand bag beneath the shoulders. Before introduction of the laryngoscope, <b>dental</b> <b>plate</b> should be put in place. [...] After tracheotomy, with a laser-safe endotracheal tube the patient is intubated with an ample exposition of the glottis. A small laser-protected endotracheal tube is placed in case there is no pre-existing tracheotomy.A modification to this technique is made by using endoscopic CO2 laser posterior cordotomy without tracheotomy to not compromise respiration by minimising the postoperative edema. This modified procedure involves a judicious excision of 3.5-4 mm C-shaped wedge in posterior vocal cord from the open edge of the membranous cord using carbon dioxide laser. Excision is made anteriorly to the vocal process, continuing 4 mm laterally on to the ventricular band without exposing the cartilage. A 6-7 mm transverse opening is created at the posterior larynx by the surgical resection. To avoid unwanted effects of general anesthesia and prevent any infection during the operation, antibiotics, steroids, and H2 blockers are administered intraoperatively.|$|E
5000|$|Eptatretus cirrhatus, more {{commonly}} known as the New Zealand hagfish or the Broadgilled hagfish has an eel-like body with no dorsal fin, a paddle-like tail and are often a grey-brown with a pink or bluish tinge of colour. Hagfish are an ancient species that evolved around 300 million years ago and have changed little since then. It is believed that hagfish share a joint ancestor with vertebrates (Zintzen et al., 2011). Although you cannot tell, the hagfish does have eyes but they are underdeveloped and covered by several layers of skin making it not visible externally (Cosidine, 1995), which is why it is also sometimes called the blind eel. The New Zealand hagfish has a skull but no jaw or true vertebral column, it instead has a skeleton made up of cartilage. The rounded mouth of the hagfish is surrounded by 6 barbels, above that is their singular nasal passage and just inside the mouth is a <b>dental</b> <b>plate</b> with a row of posterior and anterior keratinous grasping teeth on each side (Clark & Summers, 2007). It has seven pairs of gill pouches [...] and forming a line down both the lower sides of its body are pores which often many of the are ringed with a white colour and are used for secreting a snot-like slime which expands out once it has contact with the sea water.
