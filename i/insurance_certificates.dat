5000|$|The {{immediate}} impounding of {{an apparently}} uninsured vehicle replaces the former method {{of dealing with}} insurance spot-checks where drivers were issued with an HORT/1 (so-called because the order was form number 1 issued by the Home Office Road Traffic dept). This 'ticket' was an order requiring that within seven days, from midnight of the date of issue, the driver concerned was to take a valid <b>insurance</b> <b>certificate</b> (and usually other driving documents as well) to a police station of the driver's choice. Failure to produce an <b>insurance</b> <b>certificate</b> was, and still is, an offence. The HORT/1 was commonly known - even by the issuing authorities when dealing with the public - as a [...] "Producer".

5000|$|As {{with other}} {{insurance}}, {{an insurance policy}} {{is part of the}} insurance transaction. In mortgage insurance, a master policy issued to a bank or other mortgage-holding entity (the policyholder) lays out the terms and conditions of the coverage under <b>insurance</b> <b>certificates.</b> The certificates document the particular characteristics and conditions of each individual loan. The master policy includes various conditions including exclusions (conditions for denying coverage), conditions for notification of loans in default, and claims settlement. The contractual provisions in the master policy have received increased scrutiny since the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. Master policies generally require timely notice of default include provisions on monthly reports, time to file suit limitations, arbitration agreements, and exclusions for negligence, misrepresentation, and other conditions such as pre-existing environmental contaminants. The exclusions sometimes have [...] "incontestability provisions" [...] which limit the ability of the mortgage insurer to deny coverage for misrepresentations attributed to the policyholder if twelve consecutive payments are made, although these incontestability provisions generally don't apply to outright fraud.|$|E

40|$|Background: Health {{insurance}} claims (ie, receipts) record patient health care treatments and expenses and, although {{created for the}} health care payment system, are potentially useful for research. Combining different types of receipts generated for the same patient would dramatically increase the utility of these receipts. However, technical problems, including standardization of disease names and classifications, and anonymous linkage of individual receipts, must be addressed. Methods: In collaboration with health insurance societies, all information from receipts (inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy) was collected. To standardize disease names and classifications, we developed a computer-aided post-entry standardization method using a disease name dictionary based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) - 10 classifications. We also developed an anonymous linkage system by using an encryption code generated {{from a combination of}} hash values and stream ciphers. Using different sets of the original data (data set 1 : <b>insurance</b> <b>certificate</b> number, name, and sex; data set 2 : <b>insurance</b> <b>certificate</b> number, date of birth, and relationship status), we compared the percentage of successful record matches obtained by using data set 1 to generate key codes with the percentage obtained when both data sets were used. Results: The dictionary’s automatic conversion of disease names successfully standardized 98. 1 % of approximatel...|$|R

40|$|Many {{countries}} have a {{compulsory health insurance}} system in place. Compulsory health insurers charge income related fees as opposed to private health insurers who charge risk related fees. Compulsory health insurance is based on solidarity among policy holders and can give them more privacy than any private health insurer can. As an example, we consider the German health insurance system, and we discuss how the charging and clearing of medical services can be implemented so as to support both the legitimate privacy interests of patients and physicians and the health insurer's interest to control the overall cost. We present a cryptographic solution {{that is based on}} digital patient assistants, i. e., personal palmtop computers, organizers or PDAs. Patients are thus able to manage their own health <b>insurance</b> <b>certificates,</b> referrals and prescriptions.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the size {{and nature of the}} {{workload}} in general practice resulting from rheumatic diseases and to assess the value of the National Insurance 'Sick Note * as an index of this, a prospective survey was carried out. The survey was based upon a health centre which provides the primary medical care {{for the majority of the}} inhabitants of a small town. During four periods of two weeks at a different season of the year, all patients considered by the family doctor to be suffering from a rheumatic condition were seen by a visiting rheumatologist. Firm diagnostic criteria were applied and functional capacity was assessed and related to both the diagnosis and symptoms. The rheumatic diseases and conditions accounted for about 5 % of total attendances and a slightly greater proportion of total surgery time. This is less than suggested by some previous studies of different design. The sick notes provided such a poor index of the size and nature of the problem that informa-tion based merely upon retrospective analysis of these is probably of little practical value.

40|$|Vehicles account, {{operated}} by banks, shall be utilised for holding ownership {{rights of all}} vehicles a person owns. The ownership rights of vehicles of a person will be registered in his/her vehicles account. The ownership rights of vehicles {{will be transferred from}} one person’s vehicle account (manufacturer, dealer, and seller) to another person’s vehicle account when purchase/sale/donation of the vehicles are made. The ownership records will contain the vehicle’s model, manufacturing date, engine number, chassis number, registration number, fitness certificate etc. The ownership rights of all vehicles can be transferred from one vehicle account belonging to manufacturer/importer/dealer/retailer, or an individual to the buyer’s account through online just like money transfers in the present system. If the government introduces vehicles account then people will not need to have separate vehicle registration certificates, fitness certificates, and <b>insurance</b> <b>certificates</b> for each vehicle he/she owns. The bank statement of a person's vehicle account, which contains the owning record of all his/her vehicles, will suffice for all his/her vehicles.

40|$|Clearance of {{commercial}} import consignments {{can be arranged}} by an appointed Customs broker (agent) or by the owner. Private importers who wish to clear their own goods should contact the nearest Customs Service offi ce for advice on requirements and operating hours. ISSN 1175 - 396 X Why do I need a Customs clearance for imported goods? All imported goods arriving in New Zealand are {{required by law to}} be cleared through the New Zealand Customs Service. Imported goods are subject to security requirements and the payment of import duty and GST charges. Customs undertakes security screening and collects revenue charges on behalf of the New Zealand Government. What is a Customs clearance? A Customs import clearance refers to the procedure where the importer of the goods is required to lodge an electronic declaration (import entry) covering the particulars of their imported goods, the payment of any revenue charges due and subsequent formal release of those goods by Customs. What is the procedure for clearing commercial import consignments? An electronic entry must be lodged, either over the Internet at www. customsentry. govt. nz, or using EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) software. In some cases, importers may also be asked to provide additional information such as: • An airwaybill or bill of lading. • Invoices. • Other documents, such as packing lists, or <b>insurance</b> <b>certificates.</b> Importers may also need to contact shipping companies, airlines or freight forwarders for advice on their requirements, operating hours and/or location of the goods. How do I lodge a Customs import entry? Import entries may be lodged over the Internet or via EDI. Many importers use their freight forwarder or a Customs broker to lodge import clearances on their behalf, as they generally already have EDI software, and are familiar with Customs legal requirements. Using EDI EDI users are required to: • Develop or purchase EDI software which contains features necessary to transmit clearance messages and receive responses. • Test proper functionality with Customs prior to use. • Pay for the EDI link and associated messaging costs. Thus EDI is generally more suitable for higher-frequency users.
