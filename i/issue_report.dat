40|$|Abstract—Completely {{analyzed}} and closed <b>issue</b> <b>reports</b> in software development projects, {{particularly in the}} development of safety-critical systems, often carry important information about issue-related change locations. These locations may be in the source code, as well as traces to test cases affected by the issue, and related design and requirements documents. In order to help developers analyze new issues, knowledge about issue clones and duplicates, as well as other relations between the new issue and existing <b>issue</b> <b>reports</b> would be useful. This paper analyses, in an exploratory study, <b>issue</b> <b>reports</b> contained in two Issue Management Systems (IMS) containing approximately 20. 000 <b>issue</b> <b>reports.</b> The purpose of the analysis is {{to gain a better understanding}} of relationships between <b>issue</b> <b>reports</b> in IMSs. We found that link-mining explicit references can reveal complex networks of <b>issue</b> <b>reports.</b> Furthermore, we found that textual similarity analysis might have the potential to complement the explicitly signaled links by recommending additional relations. In line with work in other fields, links between software artifacts have a potential to improve search and navigation in large software engineering projects.

30|$|A reopening {{occurs when}} someone explictly changes {{the status of}} an <b>issue</b> <b>report</b> to REOPENED, which can only happen when the <b>issue</b> <b>report</b> is closed. It may appear that reopenings and late backouts should always occur together, {{but this is not}} the case. Sometimes a closed <b>issue</b> <b>report</b> is prematurely reopened because of misunderstandings. For instance, after a {{developer}} reopens an <b>issue</b> <b>report,</b> a second developer may argue that the problem found by the first is in fact a different issue, and then change the status back to RESOLVED. Therefore, reopening may imply a valid rejection, when it is followed by a late backout, or may just signal communication problems.|$|E
30|$|In Bugzilla, {{people can}} report issues and then update issue reports with {{information}} regarding the issue {{and the process of}} resolving the issue, either by uploading files (screenshots, trace logs, patches...) or by commenting and updating <b>issue</b> <b>report</b> fields. Each <b>issue</b> <b>report</b> has a status field, which can take values such as NEW, RESOLVED, VERIFIED, and REOPENED.|$|E
30|$|It {{should be}} noted that an <b>issue</b> <b>report</b> may, over its history, receive {{multiple}} patches, which may be rejected multiple times. For the sake of simplicity, we study only the first rejection, the first early backout, the first late backout, and the first reopening of an <b>issue</b> <b>report.</b> Therefore, we do not measure directly the number of patches that were rejected; instead, we measure the number of issue reports that had at least one patch rejected.|$|E

30|$|The {{code review}} process for Firefox also happens on Bugzilla, {{with the help}} of <b>issue</b> <b>report</b> flags. First of all, a {{developer}} attaches a patch to an <b>issue</b> <b>report</b> and adds the flag “review?” to the attachment, meaning that he wants someone to review the patch. The reviewer then responds by replacing the flag “review?” with either “review+” or “review-”, representing patch acceptance or rejection, respectively. When a patch is rejected, the developer should submit a revised patch and flag the old one as “obsolete”.|$|E
40|$|Many {{large-scale}} software projects {{make use}} of issue tracking tools in order to manage problems that emerge during a development effort. An <b>issue</b> <b>report</b> may document any type of problem: a fault, error, bug, schedule slip, test failure, or it may identify {{the need for additional}} features. A formal <b>issue</b> <b>report</b> often documents the cause of the problem, its impact on the project, and may even suggest a remedy. Web-based issue management tools provide an on-line repository that is accessible to developers, analysts, and project managers. Such tools allow for continuous monitoring of change activities during development and serve as a convenient means for metrics collection. This paper examines <b>issue</b> <b>report</b> databases on two, large-scale NASA software projects that employ Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) analysts to generate issue reports. We found that the average time to close an open issue is significantly influenced not only by the criticality and severity of a problem, bu [...] ...|$|E
30|$|By {{comparing}} {{the times of}} inappropriate patches with the times of patches in general (in bold in Table 2), we can see that, compared to patches in general, inappropriate patches take longer to submit, to commit, and the corresponding <b>issue</b> <b>report</b> takes longer to be closed. For instance, while 75 % of the issues take less than 12.9 days to have a patch submitted, if we consider only inappropriate patches, the time raises to 35.7 (Table 2), a 2.8 x increase. The same trend shows up if we analyze {{the time needed to}} commit a patch or to close an <b>issue</b> <b>report.</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceFeedback from {{software}} users {{constitutes a}} vital part {{in the evolution of}} software projects. By filing <b>issue</b> <b>reports,</b> users help identify and fix bugs, document software code, and enhance the software via feature requests. Many studies have explored <b>issue</b> <b>reports,</b> proposed approaches to enable the submission of higher-quality reports, and presented techniques to sort, categorize and leverage issues for software engineering needs. Who, however, cares about filing issues? What kind of <b>issues</b> are <b>reported</b> in <b>issue</b> trackers? What kind of correlation exist between <b>issue</b> <b>reporting</b> and the success of software projects? In this study, we address the need for answering such questions by performing an empirical study on a hundred thousands of open source projects.

30|$|A backout {{indicates}} that a patch that was eventually approved by a reviewer and committed to a code repository was then deemed inappropriate. Usually, in this case, it {{means that there is}} a problem with the solution: a performance issue, incorrect outputs, uncovered corner cases, and so on. A backout is classified as early when it occurs before the corresponding <b>issue</b> <b>report</b> is closed (i.e., its status is changed to RESOLVED with resolution FIXED), which happens when the patch has been integrated into a successful build. Therefore, early backouts are likely an indicator that the corresponding patch failed compilation or automated testing. A backout is classified as late when it occurs after the <b>issue</b> <b>report</b> is closed, meaning that the problem was likely discovered during manual testing.|$|E
30|$|Also, in our analyses, we {{considered}} {{only the first}} negative review, the first backout, and the first reopening of each <b>issue</b> <b>report.</b> We believe this simplification did not change significantly the results, since few issue reports contain more than one ocurrence {{of each of these}} events.|$|E

40|$|Software {{maintenance}} {{is one of}} the most expensive phases in software en-gineering, as shown by studies from the 1970 s until today. Some practitioners consider operational and maintenance costs to require as much as 85 - 90 % of their project budgets [3]. Thus, making software maintenance more efficient has po-tential to considerably reduce overall development costs. Issue management is a central part of software maintenance, revolving around <b>issue</b> <b>reports</b> collected in a central repository. Large organizations receive 10, 000 s of <b>issue</b> <b>reports</b> yearly, resulting in challenging prioritization decisions and work allocation. Our work aims to support issue management by providing automated deci-sion support [2]. A fundamental approach in our work is to make use of the rich information in issue repositories, i. e., to let previous work guide future decisions in <b>issue</b> management. <b>Issue</b> <b>reports</b> typically contain both text describing the experienced problem and other pieces of (often nominal or ordinal) information such as the version of the faulty software, the severity of the issue, and details on the execution environment.
