500|$|During 1880, Hiei visited {{ports in}} India, Persia, the Persian Gulf and various ports in Southeast Asia. The ship made annual port visits to Jinsen in Korea in 1881 through 1883. She was {{assigned}} to the Small Standing Fleet in 1886 and became a training ship in 1887 the following year. Together with her sister ship , Hiei sailed from Shinagawa, Tokyo on 13 August 1889 on a training cruise to the Mediterranean with cadets from the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, returning on 2 February 1890. On 5 October the sisters departed Shinagawa for Kobe to pick up the 69 survivors of the wrecked [...] and continued on to Constantinople, Turkey to return them to their homeland. They arrived on 2 January 1891, and the ships' officers were received by Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The ships also carried a class of naval cadets. On the return voyage, they made a port visit at Piraeus where they were visited by King George I of Greece and his son, Crown Prince Constantine. Making stops at Alexandria, Port Said, Aden, Colombo, Singapore and Hong Kong, the sisters arrived at Shinagawa on 10 May.Hiei began another cadet cruise on 30 September 1891 and visited Australia and Manila before returning to Shinagawa on 10 April 1892. The ship was not in service in 1893, but she was recommissioned before the beginning of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894. Hiei {{was assigned to}} the Standing Fleet on 2 July. She was the last ship in the Japanese line during the Battle of the Yalu River in September and was heavily damaged when her captain decided to pass through the Chinese fleet rather than try {{to keep up with the}} faster Main Squadron. The ship became the target of most of the Chinese ships and was forced to <b>disengage</b> <b>to</b> prevent further damage. Hiei was transferred to the West-Sea Fleet on 14 October, and the sisters were assigned to the Second Raiding Unit in December for operations against the Chinese port of Weihaiwei. The ships were present during the Battle of Weihaiwei in January–February 1895, although neither saw any significant combat. Hiei took part in the invasion of Formosa in 1895, and participated in the bombardment of the Chinese coastal forts at Takow (Kaohsiung) on 13 October 1895.|$|E

50|$|This was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, {{operated}} by a hydraulic controller. To change gears, the driver flicked a lever {{behind the steering wheel}} to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The hydraulic controller disengaged the clutch, engaged the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled by a centrifugal regulator sensing engine rpm and driven off the camshaft by a belt, the position of the butterfly valve in the carburettor (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the brake circuit. When the brake was pressed, the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop in idle throttle position also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following loss of system fluid), the clutch would <b>disengage,</b> <b>to</b> prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to standstill.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the camera}} is almost {{completely}} battery dependent (small exception)—power is provided by a 6 volt PX28 (originally Mercury specified 1968 and Silver-Oxide 1971), but equal substitutes PX28S/4SR44—as with many systems of the era, the mirror and cloth curtains are mechanically driven, {{the timing of the}} shutter being electrically governed by transistors and a magnet. The combination of capacitors routed by the speed setting determine the length of time the magnet remains engaged. Also, the operation of the shutter is not normally possible without film being properly loaded. However, one can test the shutter by rotating the counter dial away from the empty position while the film door is open and then by closing the film door while still holding the dial, thus facilitating the unlocking of the advance mechanism and operation of the shutter. The frame counter is incremented only while there is film passing through the [...] "main roller" [...] or [...] "counter roller" [...] next to the take-up spool in the camera. The camera disengages the [...] "transport system" [...] when the counter dial (connected to the frame counting control cam) has reached the last frame, or when the counter has returned to the [...] "empty" [...] or start position. The automatic frame counter resets only if the shutter is released before opening the back. Because a battery must power the timing, the loss of adequate voltage means the camera halts after the mirror is allowed to rise, and therefore the curtain release will not <b>disengage.</b> <b>To</b> drive the mirror to finish the cycle, a small button located flush on the right-hand camera front, just below the shutter-release button, is provided for restarting of the mirror/shutter cycle. Depressing the shutter release once more will release the cycles. The shutter release button is standard threaded for bulb or cable releases or the use of a large accessory button. The fingernail-operated latch to the left lower side releases the film door for loading. The film spools are secured by the pins and slot shaped opening at either end to the spool. The camera has two twist-lock cams that turn and pull out to open, the left side for the unexposed roll and the right side, known as the “take-up”. Because of the arrangement differences of the 120 and 220 start length of paper, the indicated starting points are marked above the film plane for lining-up of the start marks for the film. The film advance system is a tension/friction type, the film source side being a tension brake and the take-up side torque/slip clutch. A counting cam governs the frame count and interacts with the friction system to allow enough slip and movement to accurately space each frame {{from the beginning of the}} roll to the end. The counting cam also allows the system to regulate a lock to open and close, allowing the shutter to fire. This slip system has brought criticism of durability in early models, as it would slip more over time, causing frame spacing issues as well as disengaging the shutter. The frame counter system, tied to the counter roller, operates the automatic reset of the counter (returns it to start) whenever the back is opened and also sets the regulating of the next frame.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose that}} {{positive}} affect promotes dishonest behavior {{by providing the}} cognitive flexibility necessary to reframe and to rationalize dishonest acts. This hypothesis was tested in two studies. The results of Study 1 showed that individuals experiencing positive affect morally <b>disengage</b> <b>to</b> {{a greater extent than}} individuals experiencing neutral affect. Study 2 built upon this finding by demonstrating that the ability to morally disengage can lead individuals who experience positive affect to behave dishonestly. Specifically, the results of Study 2 show that people experiencing positive affect are more likely to steal than individuals who experience neutral affect, particularly when self-awareness is low. Furthermore, moral disengagement fully mediated this effect. Taken together, the results suggest that positive affect paves the way for the commission of dishonest acts by altering how individuals evaluate the moral implications of their own behavior...|$|E
40|$|The exocyst complex tethers vesicles {{at sites}} of fusion through {{interactions}} with small GTPases.

Sec 5 undergoes phosphorylation in the G-protein binding domain, allosterically reducing RalA interaction. The phosphorylation event is catalyzed by protein kinase C and is reversed by an exocyst-associated phosphatase. Introduction of Sec 5 bearing mutations of the phosphorylation site to either alanine or aspartate disrupts insulin-stimulated Glut 4 exocytosis, {{as well as other}} trafficking processes in polarized epithelial cells and during development of zebrafish embryos.
