To conduct ecological risk assessments on reptiles frequently requires using surrogate taxa such as birds, but recent {{research suggests that}} reptiles have significantly different exposure profiles and toxicant sensitivity. We exposed western fence lizards, Sceloporus occidentalis, to the same quantities of three model chemicals via oral (gavage) and dermal (ventral skin application) exposure for either 24 or 48 hours. Three phthalate esters (di-methyl phthalate [DMP], di-iso-butyl phthalate [DIBP], and di-n-octyl phthalate [DNOP]) were chosen as model chemicals because they represent a gradient of lipophilicity but are otherwise structurally similar. Overall, the more lipophilic phthalates (DIBP and DNOP) {{were found to have}} higher concentrations in tissues than the less lipophilic DMP. Significant differences in tissue concentrations between DIBP and DNOP were tissue-dependent, suggesting that delivery to a site of action following exposure is not only a simple function of lipophilicity. In <b>dermal</b> <b>treatments,</b> DMP usually had fewer detections (except in ventral skin samples), suggesting that lipophilicity (log Kow. 2) is a requirement for uptake across the skin. In general, tissue residues were greater in oral <b>treatments</b> than <b>dermal</b> <b>treatments</b> (significant in adipose and liver tissue), but differences were driven strongly by differences in DMP which {{did not appear to be}} absorbed well across skin.

Specifically, we studied on poloxamer 407 hydrogels, examining the influence of several additives and preservatives on the rheological parameters of the hydrogels, the bioactivity and release of IMPI. Methods: The rheological characterisation of the hydrogel was performed by oscillatory measurements. The bioactivity of IMPI was evaluated in a Casein fluoresence quenching assay.

However, the asthmogenic capacity of MI is currently unknown. In this study, we investigated the capacity of MI to elicit asthma-like responses in a validated mouse model. On days 1 and 8, mice (C 57 Bl/ 6 and BALB/c) were dermally treated with MI or vehicle on each ear. On day 15, mice received a single intranasal challenge with MI or vehicle. Immediately after the challenge, the early ventilatory response was measured using a double chamber plethysmograph. One day later, airway hyperreactivity, pulmonary inflammation and immune-related parameters were assessed. <b>Dermal</b> <b>treatment</b> with MI in both C 57 Bl/ 6 and BALB/c mice induced increased T- and B-cell proliferation in the auricular lymph nodes, along with IFN-γ production and limited increases in total serum IgE, confirming dermal sensitization.

However, 24 h later no allergic respiratory response (no airway hyperreactivity (AHR) nor pulmonary inflammation) was found in either mouse strains.

40|$|Diethanolamine (DEA) is {{a common}} {{ingredient}} of personal care products. Dermal administration of DEA diminishes hepatic stores of the essential nutrient choline and alters brain de-velopment. We previously reported that 80 mg/kg/day of DEA during pregnancy in mice reduced neurogenesis and increased apoptosis in the fetal hippocampus. This {{study was designed to}} establish the dose-response relationships for this effect of DEA. Timed-pregnant C 57 BL/ 6 mouse dams were dosed dermally from gestation day 7 – 17 with DEA at 0 (controls), 5, 40, 60, and 80 mg/kg body/day. Fetuses (embryonic day 17 [E 17]) from dams treated dermally with 80 mg/kg body/day DEA had decreased neural progenitor cell mitosis at the ventricular surface of the ventricular zone (hippocampus, 54. 1 ± 5. 5 %; cortex, 58. 9 ± 6. 8 %; compared to controls; p < 0. 01). Also, this dose of DEA to dams increased rates of apoptosis in E 17 fetal hippocampus (to 177. 2 ± 21. 5 % of control; measured using activated caspase- 3; p < 0. 01). This dose of DEA resulted in accumulation of DEA and its metabolites in liver and in plasma. At doses of DEA less than 80 mg/kg body/day to dams, there were no differences between treated and control groups.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine if exposure to the phytoestrogen genistein (GEN) during immune development had any effects on the production of IgE by adult mice following <b>dermal</b> <b>treatment</b> with trimellitic anhydride (TMA), a respiratory allergen. B 6 C 3 F 1 mice were exposed to GEN either by feeding at 500 ppm or by gavage (20 mg/kg) for varied periods from gestation day (GD) 14 to postnatal day (PND) 84. In utero exposure to GEN by feeding increased the production of IgE at PND 84 in male mice but not in female mice. In male mice, continuous exposure to GEN postnatally diminished the in utero exposure-induced enhancement in serum total IgE production. However, continuous exposure to GEN from GD 14 to PND 84 was required to increase serum total IgE production in female mice. In utero exposure to GEN by gavage increased the production of IgE at PND 84 in female mice but not in male mice when the mice were maintained on the NIH- 07 rodent diet in which a medium level of phytoestrogens was present. The enhancement in IgE production after GEN exposure in females but not in males was associated with decreases in the percentages of CD 4 + CD 25 + T suppressor cells, and increases in the natural killer (NK) cell activity, the basal splenocyte proliferation, the expression of CD 86 by B cells, and the production of IL- 2 and IL- 4.

40|$|From {{a survey}} of the {{literature}} it would appear that experimental skin sensitization with simple chemicals, unlike common anaphylactic sensitization, has been accomplished with certainty only by application of the incitant on or into the skin. Observations to this effect have been recorded by several authors. Simon et al. (1, 2) state that in the course of experiments on sensitizing guinea pigs to poison ivy they had "no results except with the direct application of the extract to the skin. " The same point is made by Straus (3) who found only one out of a group of 10 infants injected subcutaneously with poison ivy extract to develop sensitivity, in contrast to the more than 70 per cent positive results following cutaneous application; he remarks that it cannot be excluded that the one case might have been due to contamination of the epidermis. Similarly with neosalvarsan administered to guinea pigs, where the sensitization is not of the contact dermatitis type, Sulzberger (4) failed to obtain skin hypersensitiveness by the intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intratesticular, and intracardial routes, using a dosage effective when given intradermally. And in this laboratory preliminary experiments at sensitizing with intravenous or subcutaneous injections of 2 : 4 dinitroehlorobenzene were indecisive (5, 6). In fact, it is not infrequently held that skin sensitization {{is the result of a}} direct action on the epithelial cells, there inducing a specific change, and experiments which support this view have been performed by Straus and Coca (7; cf. 8) and more recently by Schreus and his coworkers (9, 10) (vide 11).

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the possibilities for}} screening and confirmation methods when the 'pour on' method of application is used for administration of growth promoters, an animal experiment was performed using a cocktail {{of a combination of}} growth promoters derived from (illegal) practice. Two cocktails were used, cocktail A consisting of stanozolol and estradiol benzoate and cocktail B consisting of stanozolol, estradiol benzoate and beclomethasone dipropionate. The intended dose per animal was 110 mg stanozolol, 25 mg estradiol and 10 mg beclomethasone. The experiment was performed on 20 male veal calves, 16 treated and 4 vehicle treated controls and 3 female veal calves, 2 treated and 1 vehicle treated control. Half of the animals were shaven prior to the application of the drugs. The cocktails were administered using two types of vehicles: vehicle A; Miglyol 840 with butylated hydroxytoluene and vehicle B; di(ethyleneglycol) monobutylether. During a 28 day treatment period, one group of animals was treated once a week, another group of animals was treated once every two weeks and slaughtered. Preliminary results showed that pour on application of anabolic steroids markedly increased growth performance of veal calves, the animals treated with cocktail A performed better than the animals treated with cocktail B. Macroscopically, the thymus was reduced in weight and size in the B animals. The bulbo-urethral glands were enlarged in all treated animals.

40|$|Introduction and aim Asthma {{is mainly}} {{characterized}} by reversible airflow limitation, non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Occupational asthma {{is the most}} common work-related lung disease in the industrial world. More than 200 biological and chemical products, used in industry, agriculture and the services, can cause asthma via immunologic or toxic mechanisms. Diisocyanates are commonly identified causes of occupational asthma. They are extensively used in industry, particularly in the automobile industry (foam rubber cushions, dashboards, car body parts, and for finish coatings). Airway inflammation, is a prominent characteristic of diisocyanate asthma. Both neutrophils and eosinophils were found in BAL fluid of patients with diisocyanate asthma. In the airways of diisocyanate asthmatic individuals, increased activated T lymphocytes (predominantly CD 4 + cells) have been found, as well as increased levels of cytokines produced by Th 2 cells (IL- 4, IL- 5, and IL- 13). The main aim of this thesis was to develop a satisfactory mouse model for chemical-induced occupational asthma. To achieve this aim, the following objectives were pursued. 1. Verify whether a model, based on a protocol for assessing the risk of dermal sensitization, would allow identification of respiratory sensitizers (chapter 2). 2. Verify whether the most common features of asthma, i. e. reversible airway obstruction, non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation could be achieved in that model (chapter 3). 3. Verify the immunological mechanisms to improve our understanding of the developed model (chapter 4). A good identification of allergenic low molecular weight chemicals is of great importance for industry and occupational health. Main results Chapter 2 : Investigating the (respiratory) sensitizing capacity of PCT. Chapter 2 originated from an outbreak of occupational asthma in a plastic factory. The causal agent was found to be a piperidinyl chlorotriazine derivative (PCT), a novel UVstabilizer. PCT was found to be only slightly positive in the mouse local lymph node assay (LLNA) and the “mouse IgE test”, because only very high concentrations (10 and 20 %) yielded positive responses. This was not in agreement with experience in humans. We developed a mouse model, based on the LLNA; whereby sensitization was achieved by <b>dermal</b> <b>treatment</b> on the ears for three consecutive days (day 1, 2 and 3) and challenge was done by an intranasal challenge on day 10. On day 11 methacholine challenge was performed. This protocol allowed us to identify respiratory sensitizers such as toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and PCT, because only mice previously treated with these sensitizers exhibited increased ventilatory responsiveness to methacholine 24 h after an intranasal challenge. The serum level of total IgE was increased in mice treated with TDI, but not in those treated with PCT, indicating that besides total IgE, other factors {{play a critical role in}} hyperresponsiveness. Chapter 3 : Development of a murine model for chemically induced asthma. A refined protocol, using an additional dermal application on day 7, resulted in an asthma model that exhibited several features of human asthma. Mice dermally sensitized and intranasally challenged with TDI showed pronounced signs of airway obstruction immediately after intranasal challenge, signs of increased bronchial hyperreactivity to methacholine 24 h later, as well as airway inflammation (neutrophils in the BAL fluid and a few eosinophils around the blood vessels). We found that the concentration (3 %, 1 % or 0. 3 % TDI) and frequency (day 1, 2 and 3 or day 1 alone) of the initial dermal sensitization are critical. When mice were sensitized with 3 % TDI for three consecutive days, the respiratory response was blunted, whereas it was enhanced in the “lightly” sensitized (either 0. 3 % TDI for three days, or 1 % TDI on a single day) animals. Chapter 4 : Starting to unravel the immunologic mechanisms underlying our model. At several time points after intranasal administration of TDI (1 h, 6 h and 24 h), BAL fluid was investigated for the presence of inflammatory cells and cytokines. The lymph nodes draining the ear (auricular) were removed 24 h after intranasal challenge to determine the lymphocyte sub-populations and secreting cytokine profile (Th 1 vs. Th 2). We confirmed that dermally treated mice showed an increased Penh after intranasal challenge with TDI. In BAL, from the responsive groups, an increase in total cell count, was found 6 h after the challenge, and the differential cell count showed an increase in neutrophils (10 - 30 %), which corresponds to increased levels of MIP- 2. Lymphocytes obtained from the auricular lymph nodes, which drain the ears, showed an increase in the proportion of B-cells and a secretion profile (after in vitro stimulation with Concanavaline A) indicative of both Th 1 – Th 2 (T helper type 1 and 2 cell), i. e. an increase of interleukin- 4 and an increase of interferon- g. Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID) mice that were sensitized, “boosted” and challenged with TDI did not show ventilatory changes, suggesting, that lymphocytes are necessary to induce the ventilatory changes. Conclusion We almost succeeded in creating a satisfactory model for chemical-induced asthma. Our findings point to a mixed Th 1 – Th 2 response, in contrast to high molecular weight compound allergens, which induce atopic asthma via the Th 2 pathway. Several questions remain to be answered, including the determination of relevant diisocyanate antigens and routes of exposure, better characterization of the inflammatory cells and mediators responsible for diisocyanate sensitization and asthma, and identification of the genetic factors that regulate airway inflammation. Until now, no mouse model perfectly replicates real-life human diisocyanate-induced disease in humans. Nevertheless, good models are important to protect workers from chemicals that can cause occupational asthma. nrpages: 132 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|BMP {{signaling}} has {{a crucial}} role in skin development and homeostasis, whereas molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in regulating gene expression programs in keratinocytes and fibroblasts remain largely unknown.

Furthermore, our data suggest that the potential modulation of cell adhesion, extracellular matrix remodeling, motility, metabolism, signaling, and transcription by BMP- 4 in keratinocytes and fibroblasts is likely to be achieved by the distinct and cell-type-specific sets of molecules.

Simultaneous release of silver sulfadiazine and bupivacaine from the sIPN would provide multiple-hit management of dermal wounds that minimizes infection, and manages pain along with sIPN absorption of exudates and facilitation of epidermal regrowth. We characterized {{the release of}} soluble silver sulfadiazine and bupivacaine and compared it with an established release model. Efficacy of released silver sulfadiazine was confirmed in vitro on Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bupivacaine loaded without silver sulfadiazine showed incomplete release, whereas simultaneous loading with silver sulfadiazine facilitated 100 % bupivacaine release. Silver sulfadiazine released at 98 % without bupivacaine and 96 % with bupivacaine. Silver sulfadiazine released onto bacterial cultures inhibited all three strains dose dependently. sIPNs effectively release bupivacaine and silver sulfadiazine while maintaining the antimicrobial activity of silver sulfadiazine. Drug loaded sIPNs have potential to improve wound management by providing multi-drug delivery along with an effective wound treatment. Copyright © 2009 by the American Burn Association.

40|$|SUMMARY: HNSCC that {{involves}} the skin is able to invade the dermal lymphatic system. Currently {{there is no way}} to identify patients with dermal lymphatic invasion preoperatively. The purpose of this study is to determine whether CT can predict dermal lymphatic invasion. Medical records, CT scans, and corresponding histopathologic slides were reviewed of HNSCC patients with skin resected as part of their <b>treatment.</b> <b>Dermal</b> lymphatic invasion was defined radiographically as linear reticulations of the dermis and subcutaneous fat adjacent to the tumor. Twelve patients were identified with imaging suggestive of dermal lymphatic invasion. The corresponding pathology slides showed only 1 of the 12 patients had dermal lymphatic invasion, whereas the other 11 specimens showed peritumoral inflam-mation without evidence of tumor invasion. This study demonstrates that the linear areas of reticula-tion are most commonly caused by peritumoral inflammation and are not due to dermal lymphatic invasion. ABBREVIATION: HNSCC head and neck squamous cell carcinoma Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer inthe world, with more than 600, 000 cases diagnosed each year. 1 The identification of clinicopathologic prognostic fac-tors in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is one of th...|$|R
40|$|Com o processo de envelhecimento, o {{organism}}o sofre várias modificações bioquímicas, morfológicas e funcionais, sendo que estas mudanças são caracterizadas por atrofias e diminuições no funcionamento de diversos órgãos. Diferentes sistemas orgânicos são afetados e apresentam modificações ao longo dos anos, dentre eles, a pele. O presente trabalho versa sobre a atuação da fisioterapia em doenças e alterações na pele dos idosos. O objetivo da pesquisa foi observar a necessidade da atuação da fisioterapia dermato-funcional, numa instituição de longa permanência de idosos, a partir do diagnóstico médico das principais doenças dermatológicas, realizado previamente. A partir desse levantamento médico, foi definido em quais patologias a fisioterapia dermatofuncional pode complementar e ou tratar tais doenças e alterações. Alem disso, foram descritas as técnicas fisioterapêuticas disponíveis para o tratamento das patologias dermatológicas detectadas em avaliação clínica, bem como analise do percentual das patologias dermatológicas tratáveis com as técnicas disponíveis na fisioterapia dermato-funcional. With {{the aging}} process, the organism suffers from several biochemical, morphological and functional changes, which {{are characterized by}} atrophies {{and a decrease in}} function of several organs. Different organic systems are affected and they present alterations throughout the years, including the skin. Recently, functional physical therapy in dermatology has come up with an important specialty in <b>dermal</b> problems <b>treatment.</b> The present work is about the role of physiotherapy in skin diseases and alterations in elderly. The present research aimed at observing the need of functional physical therapy in dermatology to be carried out in long-term institutions for elderly people, having the medical diagnosis on the main dermal diseases previously performed. It is concluded that functional physical therapy in dermatology has the potential of intervening therapeutically in 70. 2 % of the reported diseases. Such diseases have potential negative impact in elderly quality of life. Prospective works must confirm efficacy of therapeutic interventions of functional physical therapy in dermatology in improving skin disorders and {{the quality of life in}} the elderly as well as observing economic viability for implanting a specialized service in a long-term institution for elderly people...|$|R
40|$|Human skin {{is exposed}} to {{infrared}} radiation (IR) from natural and artificial sources. In previous studies, near IR radiation (IRA; 760 – 1, 440 nm) was shown to elicit a retrograde mitochondrial signaling response leading to induction of matrix metalloproteinase- 1 (MMP- 1) expression. These studies, however, have exclusively employed cultured human skin fibroblasts ex vivo. Here, we have assessed the in vivo relevance of these observations by exposing healthy human skin in vivo to physiologically relevant doses of IRA. Eighty percent of the tested individuals responded to IRA radiation by upregulating of MMP- 1 expression. Specifically, IRA irradiation caused increased expression of MMP- 1 in the dermis, {{but not in the}} epidermis. Raman spectroscopy revealed that IRA radiation also caused a significant decrease in the antioxidant content of human skin. In vitro studies had previously shown that IRA-induced MMP- 1 expression was mediated through an oxidative stress response, which originates from the mitochondrial electron transport chain. We now report that incubation of cultured human <b>dermal</b> fibroblasts or <b>treatment</b> of human skin with specific antioxidants prevented IRA radiation-induced MMP- 1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Thus, IRA irradiation most likely promotes premature skin aging and topical application of appropriate antioxidants represents an effective photoprotective strategy...|$|R
40|$|We have characterised {{a protein}} of {{approximately}} 80 kD previously observed to co-immunoprecipitate with the alpha 3 beta 1 integrin in lysates of surface labelled human epidermalkeratinocytes. The 80 kD protein only appeared when keratinocytes were harvested with trypsin/EDTA prior to lysis and a protein of similar molecular mass could be immunoprecipitated from human <b>dermal</b> fibroblasts following <b>treatment</b> {{of the cells}} with trypsin/EDTA. N terminal sequencing established that the 80 kD protein had homology with the alpha 3 integrin subunit. Peptide-mass fingerprinting was used {{to confirm that the}} protein comprised the amino terminus of alpha 3 and established that the site of cleavage was after amino acid 629. The 80 kD fragment could be coimmunoprecipitated with alpha 3 beta 1 using an antibody to the cytoplasmic domain of the alpha 3 subunit, showing that the fragment remained complexed with intact alpha 3 beta 1. When antibodies to the cytoplasmic and extracellular domains of alpha 3 were used to label human epidermis by immunofluorescence, the staining patterns were indistinguishable and there is therefore no evidence that proteolysis of alpha 3 plays a role in keratinocyte detachment from the basement membrane during terminal differentiation. Whether the 80 kD fragment has any effects, positive or negative, on alpha 3 beta 1 -mediated adhesion remains to be determined...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: There is {{increasing}} {{evidence that the}} endocannabinoid system {{may be involved in}} pathological fibrosis, and that its modulation might limit fibrotic responses. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the capacity of a synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist to modify skin fibrosis in the bleomycin mouse model of scleroderma. METHODS: Skin fibrosis was induced by local injections of bleomycin in two groups of DBA/ 2 J mice. One group was cotreated with the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55, 212 - 2 at 1 mg/kg/day. Skin fibrosis was evaluated by histology and skin thickness and hydroxyproline content were quantified. Markers of fibroblast activation, including α smooth muscle actin and the profibrotic cytokines transforming growth factor (TGF) β, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) -BB, were examined. Levels of PSMAD 2 / 3, which are crucial in extracellular matrix overproduction, were analysed. RESULTS: Bleomycin treatment induced typical skin fibrosis. Upon WIN 55, 212 - 2 <b>treatment</b> <b>dermal</b> fibrosis was completely prevented. Subcutaneous inflammatory cell infiltration, dermal thickness and collagen content resulted similar to those of the control group. The synthetic cannabinoid prevented fibroblasts activation induced by bleomycin, paralleled by a strong inhibition of TGFβ, CTGF and PDGF-BB expression. Phosphorylation of SMAD 2 / 3 was significantly downregulated after WIN 55, 212 - 2 exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results indicate that the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55, 212 - 2 is capable of preventing skin fibrosis in a mouse model of scleroderma...|$|R

Lidocaine (LID) combined with prilocaine (PRI) {{has been used as}} a topical preparation for <b>dermal</b> anesthesia for <b>treatment</b> of conditions such as paresthesia. Materials and methods: In this study, for combination anesthesia and overcoming the drawbacks of LID and PRI, respectively, LID- and PRI-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) were prepared and characterized by determination of their particle size, drug loading capacity, stability, in vitro drug release behavior and in vitro cellular viability. Ex vivo skin permeation and in vivo anesthesia analgesic efficiency of these two systems were also evaluated and compared. Results: Results revealed that combination delivery of the dual drugs exhibited more remarkable efficiency than signal drug-loaded systems. SLN systems have better ex vivo skin permeation ability than NLCs. NLC systems revealed a stronger in vivo anesthesia analgesic effect than SLN systems. Conclusion: It can be concluded that SLNs and NLCs have different advantages, and that both carriers are promising dual drug delivery systems for topical anesthetic analgesic therapy.

40|$|Bleomycin has a {{chemical}} toxicity capable of inducing superoxide radicals, which are suggested {{to play an}} important part in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. We have recently established a mouse model for scleroderma induced by repeated local injections of bleomycin. In this study, we examined the inhibitory effect of superoxide dismutase on the development of dermal sclerosis induced by bleomycin using this mouse model. PC-superoxide dismutase, which is a lecithinized superoxide dismutase with high tissue accumulation and long half-life in blood, was administered (3000 [*]U per kg; dissolved in 5 % mannitol) 3 [*]h before the injection of bleomycin in C 3 H mice for 3 [*]wk. Systemic PC-superoxide dismutase markedly inhibited the development of dermal sclerosis, which was also accompanied by a {{decrease in the number of}} infiltrating mast cells and eosinophils. Furthermore, the hydroxyproline content in the skin was significantly reduced, as compared with mice treated with bleomycin only or bleomycin and 5 % mannitol. In a separate experiment, after the development of <b>dermal</b> sclerosis following <b>treatment</b> with bleomycin for 3 [*]wk, PC-superoxide dismutase was administered for 2 [*]wk. Histologic examination again revealed a reduction of dermal sclerosis, followed by a significant associate in the number of both mast cells and eosinophils. The hydroxyproline content in the skin was not significantly decreased, however, even after injections of high amounts of PC-superoxide dismutase (30, 000 [*]U per kg). These results support the involvement of oxygen free radicals in bleomycin-induced dermal sclerosis, and also indicate that administration of superoxide dismutase may be effective in the therapeutic approach in systemic sclerosis...|$|R
30|$|Stromal cells {{provide a}} crucial {{microenvironment}} for overlying epithelium. Here we investigated the expression {{and function of}} a stromal cell-specific protein, stromal cell-derived factor- 1 (SDF- 1), in normal human skin and in the tissues of diseased skin. Immunohistology and laser capture microdissection (LCM)-coupled quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that SDF- 1 is constitutively and predominantly expressed in dermal stromal cells in normal human skin in vivo. To our surprise, an extremely high level of SDF- 1 transcription was observed in the dermis of normal human skin in vivo, evidenced by much higher mRNA expression level than type I collagen, the most abundant and highly expressed protein in human skin. SDF- 1 was also upregulated in the tissues of many human skin disorders including psoriasis, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Double immunostaining for SDF- 1 and HSP 47 (heat shock protein 47), a marker of fibroblasts, revealed that fibroblasts were {{the major source of}} stroma-cell-derived SDF- 1 in both normal and diseased skin. Functionally, SDF- 1 activates the ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinases) pathway and functions as a mitogen to stimulate epidermal keratinocyte proliferation. Both overexpression of SDF- 1 in <b>dermal</b> fibroblasts and <b>treatment</b> with rhSDF- 1 to the skin equivalent cultures significantly increased the number of keratinocyte layers and epidermal thickness. Conversely, the stimulative function of SDF- 1 on keratinocyte proliferation was nearly completely eliminated by interfering with CXCR 4, a specific receptor of SDF- 1, or by knock-down of SDF- 1 in fibroblasts. Our data reveal that extremely high levels of SDF- 1 provide a crucial microenvironment for epidermal keratinocyte proliferation in both physiologic and pathologic skin conditions.|$|R
