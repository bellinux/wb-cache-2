The topology supports voltage scaling between a subthreshold voltage of 400 mV and a regular supply voltage of 1. 2 V. SRAM cells for ultra-low voltage operation and surrounding read and write circuitry is implemented using {{state of the art}} design techniques and literature. An asynchronous self-timed SRAM topology was implemented with conventional 6 T SRAM cells and 10 T SRAM cells specifically designed for ultra-low voltage operation. A small set of logic gates was also designed for ultra-low voltage operation to realize the surrounding read and write control circuitry. All building blocks were simulated with extracted parasitics from layout to get realistic simulation results. Corner and Monte Carlo simulations were used to show how temperature and process variations statistically affected the building blocks and their performance at both subthreshld and superthreshold voltages. Simulation results shows that the 10 T cell is more robust at 400 mV with a 60 - 70 % larger static noise margin compared to the conventional 6 T cell, but consumes more leakage power and is physically 64 % larger. The 10 T cell also needs more time to perform a read " 0 " operation since the single-ended nature of the SRAM cell requires a full bitline-swing to perform the read operation whereas the differential nature of the 6 T cells speed up the read operation, but the offset voltage of the sense amplifier limits the speed gain at 400 mV somewhat compared to at 1. 2 V. The read operation of the 6 T cell causes a <b>disturb</b> <b>voltage</b> in the internal nodes of the SRAM cell and its magnitude is affected by the number of SRAM cells in the array, the width of the wordline signal and temperature. The impact of these factors are greater at high voltages, making it difficult to assess the yield in systems with voltage scaling. The 10 T cell uses a read buffer to decouple the read and write operation and do not encounter this problem and this makes the 10 T cell more predictable with voltage scaling and the safest choice for future implementations. The results also show that the power savings when moving from 1. 2 V to 400 mV are withing the range of 5 - 18 times depending on the severity of process variations and temperature. The lowest power savings occur at high temperatures due to increased leakage currents. The largest savings occurs at low temperatures, but the performance is degraded {{to such a degree that}} the 10 T implementation requires 5 32 kHz clock cycles to complete a read " 0 " operation while the 6 T implementation requires 3 at - 40 C in the SS process corner.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to obtain insight into the oscillation behaviour of the liquid metal and the arc behaviour during GMA welding. Observations of the weld pool and the arc were undertaken by visual means using a high-speed video and by analysis of the voltage. To deal with the complex phenomena that take place, the research is performed in two steps; firstly, with cold-wire GTA welding on stainless steel AISI 316 L tubes where a filler wire is introduced into the weld pool without being preheated, and secondly with pulsed-current GMA (P-GMA) welding on mild steel S 235 JR plate. The results of the cold-wire GTA experiments showed that for the same penetration state the oscillation modes of the cold-wire and the autogenous GTA weld pools are similar. The partially and the fully penetrated welds oscillate in a sloshy mode and frequencies can be predicted from relatively simple analytical expressions based on weld pool length rather than an equivalent weld pool diameter. When cold-wire GTA welding is performed in the uninterrupted bridging transfer mode the metal transfer does not <b>disturb</b> the <b>voltage</b> signals. The oscillation frequency can be determined from the analysis of voltage signals with the same accuracy {{as in the case of}} autogenous GTA welding. Penetration sensing based on pool oscillation can be applied successfully with this welding mode. The pendant droplet in the case of interrupted metal transfer can oscillate due to the action of the plasma jet. This oscillation may <b>disturb</b> the <b>voltage</b> signals associated with weld pool oscillations. The interaction between the transferred droplets and the weld pool triggers the pool into oscillation. Accordingly the results of voltage analysis to determine the weld pool oscillation frequency can be less accurate than those obtained in the case of autogenous GTA welding or the uninterrupted cold-wire GTA welding. The results of the P-GMA welding experiments showed that the current pulses cannot be used to trigger weld pool oscillation effectively, but the impact of the transferred metal droplets can generate travelling liquid waves on the pool. It is also found that the pendant droplet oscillates in an up-and-down motion. In P-GMA welding the dynamics of the weld pool are not reflected clearly on the voltage. In contrast, the oscillation of the pendant droplet is indicated on the voltage signals. The experiments showed that the arc can be divided into different regions based on its intensities. The extent of the different arc regions changes due to the growth and the oscillation of the droplet, which influences the voltage and leads to a nonlinear relationship between the arc voltage and the arc length. There is strong evidence that the modification of the arc structure is caused by the alteration of metal vapour concentration in the plasma. A proposed conceptual model describes the relationship between the arc voltage and the extent of the different arc regions. The model indicates that the average electric field strength of the bright arc region close to the electrode is higher than that of the normal arc. This result can be of importance for improving welding process control and through the arc sensing, for example for optimising droplet detachment to minimise spatter and reduce fume generation The physical phenomena taking place within the different regions of the arc however require further research. This should include experimental measurements of arc composition and temperature, and the development of a mathematical model of the plasma, including energy exchange due to radiative transport and multi-component diffusion.

INTRODUCTION Nowadays, many segments of microelectronics move towards monolithic system integration merging on the same IC (Smart power ICs) low voltage analog and/or digital parts with high voltage parts using power transistors. Substrate coupling in Smart power ICs occurs when parasitic bipolar structures (with unpredictable size and location) are activated after an injection of current into the substrate due to internal switching activity or external noise coupling. When low power analog and digital applications are integrated with high voltage (HV) devices on the same IC, these side effects become very important and hurtful to the circuit operation. In turn, designers have to rely on empirical basis for the design strategy, which is expensive and time consuming.

These sites are then grouped into clusters of similar macroinvertebrate communities. The clusters are analysed to find relationships between the physical, geographical and chemical properties of sites in a cluster and the corresponding macroinvertebrate communities. The relationships found are then used to predict the macroinvertebrate communities at non-reference sites that would be expected if these sites were <b>equivalent</b> to least <b>disturbed</b> reference conditions. To determine the level of river health, the expected macroinvertebrate community is compared with the observed community. As part of AusRivAS, the clustering step is conducted using the statistical Unweighted Pair Group Arithmetic Averaging (UPGMA) method. A potential shortcoming of this approach is that it uses a linear performance measure for grouping similar data points.

40|$|MHRD PhD scholarshipWith Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chips (MPSoCs) pervading our lives, {{security}} issues are {{emerging as a}} serious problem and attacks against these systems are becoming more critical and sophisticated. We have designed and implemented different hardware based solutions to ensure security of an MPSoC. Security assisting modules can be implemented at different abstraction levels of an MPSoC design. We propose solutions both at circuit level and system level of abstractions. At the VLSI circuit level abstraction, we consider the problem of presence of noise voltage in input signal coming from outside world. This noise <b>voltage</b> <b>disturbs</b> the normal circuit operation inside a chip causing false logic reception. If the disturbance is caused intentionally {{the security of a}} chip may be compromised causing glitch/transient attack. We propose an input receiver with hysteresis characteristic that can work at voltage levels between 0. 9 V and 5 V. The circuit can protect the MPSoC from glitch/transient attack. At the system level, we propose solutions targeting Network-on-Chip (NoC) as the on-chip communication medium. We survey the possible attack scenarios on present-day MPSoCs and investigate a new attack scenario, i. e., router attack targeted toward NoC enabled MPSoC. We propose different monitoring-based countermeasures against routing table-based router attack in an MPSoC having multiple Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Software attacks, {{the most common type of}} attacks, mainly exploit vulnerabilities like buffer overflow. This is possible if proper access control to memory is absent in the system. We propose four hardware based mechanisms to implement Role Based Access Control (RBAC) model in NoC based MPSoC...|$|R
40|$|Memory {{devices are}} intensively gaining {{importance}} in the semiconductors market, due to the increasing demand for larger storage capabilities in all portable devices. Every CPU-based device is provided with various memory modules, performing different tasks and working with different speed and electric power. Nevertheless, the aggressive scaling of the devices dimensions is currently subject to several issues that are slowing down its pace. Furthermore, the current nonvolatile memory modules, implemented with Flash devices, are more than three orders of magnitude slower, in terms of write/read speed, than the RAM modules, introducing a bottleneck in the overall speed of the electronic devices. For these reasons, the memory producers are fostering the investigation of new concepts {{for the implementation of}} nonvolatile memory devices. Within the large spectrum of emerging memory technologies, Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM), based on the switching of the device resistance, are strongly attracting the interest of the memory industry due to their ease of fabrication and because they ensure, with respect to Flash devices, higher write speed and lower switching voltages. Among all the RRAM concepts, Conductive-Bridge RAM (CBRAM), relying on the voltage-induced formation/dissolution of a metal filament inside a solid electrolyte, placed between an electrochemically active electrode (Cu or Ag) and an inert electrode, are particularly attractive because of their highly controllable memory operation at low programming current. However, despite the promising performance, several reliability issues, such as the data retention and the write endurance require further development of the material combinations and of the programming conditions. Moreover, the knowledge about the switching processes occurring at the nanoscale is still superficial, hindering the identification of eventual key factors that determine the device performances. This manuscript aims at describing, on the one hand, the optimization of the materials stack and of the programming conditions of a CMOS-friendly CBRAM device in a low-current (10 μA) regime and, on the other hand, the physical investigation of the switching dynamics of the optimized device. The electrical characterization of the different material combinations {{led to the development of}} a W/WOx/Al 2 O 3 /TiW/Cu CBRAM stack ensuring high switching reproducibility. On this stack, by engineering the programming conditions, excellent immunity to <b>voltage</b> <b>disturbs</b> (10 years at ± 0. 5 V) and a large memory window (> 10 ^ 3) are combined with a write endurance of 10 ^ 6 cycles obtained by applying 10 -ns pulses. For the considered current regime of 10 μA, these CBRAM devices are also demonstrated to offer better performances in terms of memory window, state variability and write speed with respect to state-of-the-art oxygen-vacancy based RRAM devices (OxRRAM). Significant results are achieved in the frame of the physical understanding of the switching dynamics. The electron transport in the two states is analyzed, demonstrating that it can be well reproduced by the quantum-pointcontact (QPC) model, and revealing that the resistive switching consists of the modulation of the dimensions of the narrowest part of the conductive filament (constriction). The lower variability, with respect to OxRRAM devices, is attributed to the extracted smaller size of a single Cu atom with respect to an oxygen vacancy and, moreover, the outstanding robustness to <b>voltage</b> <b>disturbs</b> is related to the peculiar “hourglass” shape of the conductive filament in these devices. The reproducibility of the resistive switching at low current (< 10 μA) is attributed to the mobility of the active species in the solid electrolyte and, finally, the stability of the metallic filament is thoroughly investigated, associating it to the amount of active species that are present/injected into the solid electrolyte. The combination of the electrical characterization and of the physical modeling leads to a thorough depiction of the features of these CBRAM devices, and provides various perspectives for a further improvement of their electrical performances. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The Australian River Assessment System (AusRivAS) is a nation-wide program {{designed}} to assess the health of Australian rivers and streams. The general AusRivAS method involves {{the establishment of a}} database of reference sites, which are sites that are considered to be minimally affected by anthropogenic impacts. These sites are then grouped into clusters of similar macroinvertebrate communities. The clusters are analysed to find relationships between the physical, geographical and chemical properties of sites in a cluster and the corresponding macroinvertebrate communities. The relationships found are then used to predict the macroinvertebrate communities at non-reference sites that would be expected if these sites were <b>equivalent</b> to least <b>disturbed</b> reference conditions. To determine the level of river health, the expected macroinvertebrate community is compared with the observed community. As part of AusRivAS, the clustering step is conducted using the statistical Unweighted Pair Group Arithmetic Averaging (UPGMA) method. A potential shortcoming of this approach is that it uses a linear performance measure for grouping similar data points. A recently developed approach for clustering ecological data (MIR-max) overcomes this limitation by using mutual information as the performance measure. In this paper, an alternative to the MIRmax technique (MIRA 4) is proposed, which uses genetic algorithms for optimising the overall mutual information of the ecological data clusters. The MIR-max and MIRA 4 approaches are applied to the South Australian combined season riffle AusRivAS data, and the results obtained are compared with those obtained using the UPGMA method. The results indicate that the overall mutual information values of the clusters obtained using MIR-max and MIRA 4 are significantly higher than those obtained using the UPGMA method, and that the use of genetic algorithms is successful in determining clusters with higher overall mutual information values compared with those obtained using MIR-max for the case study considered.

40|$|In {{this work}} Reactive Power Planning (RPP) is studied. It is the method which aims at {{locating}} reactive compensators of optimal size at an optimal location {{in order to}} achieve or optimize a certain objective. In this work, the reactive compensators are placed in such away that they keep the voltages in a grid longer stable and within an acceptable range of values while power flows through the grid. Usually, this power flow <b>disturbs</b> the <b>voltages.</b> The RPP was applied in this work in order to allow a larger power flow from one grid area to another grid area. The first area is called the Source area and it contains generators which can produce power at a cheap price. The second area is called the Sink area and it is willing to import this cheap power so that it has to produce less power by itself. The two areas are connected to each other with a tie-line, which has a certain capacity (called Net Transfer Capacity or NTC). The capacity is restricted by stability requirements: exceeding the capacity would cause voltages to become unstable in either of the two grid areas. Installing reactive power compensators allows to increase the capacity of the line, keeping the voltages stable when the power flow over the tie-line increases. Reactive Power Planning therefore has an economic benefit, and different methods to optimize it will be investigated in this work. This work is divided into three parts. In the first part the relationship is studied between reactive power compensation {{on the one hand and}} the increase of the NTC of the tie-line on the other hand. The grid which is used to illustrate this is the Swedish grid, connected to the grids of Denmark and Finland. It is observed that not only increasing the loads can lead to voltage instability in the grid, but that voltage problems can also arise within the Swedish grid from the exchange of power,owing through the Swedish grid, between its neighbouring countries. It is shown that reactive power compensation is a technique which can potentially increase the NTC-value of the tie-lines between Sweden and Denmark and between Sweden and Finland. Depending on where the reactive power compensators are installed, the NTC increases with different values. In the next two parts however, we focus on the economic analysis of the reactive power compensation. In these two parts, an Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem is designed, leading to the optimal placement and choice of the reactive power compensators. The optimal compensators increase the NTC so that the benefit of the decreased cost of power generationin the Sink area is maximized with respect to the cost of the reactive compensators. The difference between these two parts is in the algorithms that are applied for solving the OPF. In the second part a heuristic method based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA), NSGA-II, is used to optimize this benefit. The reason why first a heuristic method is used is that the NTC of the tie-line cannot be expressed as an analytical, closed-form function of the reactive power ratings. Therefore, a heuristic optimization method is chosen to solve the OPF and the algorithm NSGA-II is used because of its good convergence properties and ease of implementation. However, the algorithm is also able to perform multi-objective optimization and this ability is used to optimize both the economic benefit and the voltage stability index of the Sink area. It is seen that there is a trade-off between voltage stability and economic benefit and it is up to the grid operators to make choices regarding this trade-off. In the third part of this work a mathematical method is used to maximize the economic benefit of the Sink area with respect to the cost of the reactive compensators. As much as possible mathematical expressions will be used in this part. As the NTC cannot be expressed as a closed-form function, some approximations need to be made. Two methods were proposed to approximate the NTC: approximation by piecewise linear functions and by polynomials obtained with statistical regression. This mathematical method leads to a Voltage Stability Constrained OPF (VSCOPF). It is programmed in GAMS and formulated as a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming problem (MINLP) ...|$|R
