25|$|Neural {{oscillation}} {{can also}} arise from interactions between different brain areas coupled through the structural connectome. Time delays {{play an important}} role here. Because all brain areas are bidirectionally coupled, these connections between brain areas form feedback loops. Positive feedback loops tends to cause oscillatory activity where frequency is inversely related to the <b>delay</b> <b>time.</b> An example of such a feedback loop is the connections between the thalamus and cortex. This thalamocortical network is able to generate oscillatory activity known as recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance. The thalamocortical network {{plays an important role in}} the generation of alpha activity. In a whole-brain network model with realistic anatomical connectivity and propagation delays between brain areas, oscillations in the beta frequency range emerge from the partial synchronisation of subsets of brain areas oscillating in the gamma-band (generated at the mesoscopic level).|$|E
25|$|Tuberous organs, {{the type}} of {{receptive}} organ used for electrocommunication, {{can be divided into}} two types, depending on the way information is encoded: time coders and amplitude coders. There are multiple forms of tuberous organs in each time and amplitude coders, and all weakly electric fish species possess at least one form of the two coders. Time coder fires phase-locked action potential (meaning, the waveform of the action potential is always the same) at a fixed <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> after each outside transient is formed. Therefore, time coders neglect information about waveform and amplitude but focus on frequency of the signal and fire action potentials on a 1:1 basis to the outside transient. Amplitude coders, on the contrary, fire according to the EOD amplitude. While both wave-type and pulse-type fishes have amplitude coders, they fire in different ways: Receptors of wave-type fishes continuously fire at a rate according to their own EOD amplitude; on the other hand, receptors of pulse-type fishes fire burst of spikes to each EOD detected, and the number of spikes in each burst is correlated to the amplitude of the EOD. Tuberous electroreceptors show a V-shaped threshold tuning curve (similar to auditory system), which means that they are tuned to a particular frequency. This particular tuned-in frequency is usually closely matched to their own EOD frequency.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the dynamics of}} <b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> and real time computer-mediated communication (CMC) when small groups use text-based computer communication programs to reach closure on a priority setting problem task. This study was a preliminary investigation into the effects of computer-mediated communication mode on several measures: decision quality, gain-loss scores and utilization resources, time to solution, text sequencing, and text readability. The problem related to identifying mode of transmission (<b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> and real time) as a variable that can directly impact computer-mediated discourse. Prior studies involving CMC and group decision making were performed using either <b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> or real time computer-mediated communication mode (Kiesler, Siegel, 2 ̆ 6 McGuire, 1984; Sproull and Kiesler, 1986). This study investigated group communication under both modes. Thirty two (N= 32) three-person member groups completed a priority setting problem online in a unix* environment that supports computer-mediated communication in <b>delayed</b> and real <b>time</b> modes. Ninety six participants {{were randomly assigned to}} one of two computer- mediated communication modes (<b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> or real time). All participants completed the task from their home locations, communicating via modem connection to Nova University 2 ̆ 7 s VAX 8550 mini-computer running DEC 2 ̆ 7 s version of Unix, 2 ̆ 2 Ultrix 2 ̆ 2 Version 2. 3. Participants were physically, and potentially geographically and time-zone dispersed from others with whom they participated with in the experiment. There was no face-to-face interaction among group members. Transcripts of electronic mail (<b>delayed</b> <b>time)</b> activities and recordings of 2 ̆ 2 Phone 2 ̆ 2 (real time) computer conversation program activities were made during the experiment and later analyzed. It was hypothesized that there would be a difference between CMC mode and group decision making performance and that coordination of communication would be reduced more under <b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> CMC than under real time CMC. Additionally, it was hypothesized that <b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> groups would take longer to reach closure on the task than real time groups. It was also hypothesized that <b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> groups would prepare and share more text than real time groups. It was also hypothesized that <b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> groups would produce higher text readability grade levels than real time CMC groups. Two of four hypotheses were supported. Bonferroni protected univariate F analyses were performed at the. 01 level of significance. Results indicated that while patterns of group process to reach closure were unique according to respective CMC modes, there were no significant differences between groups in regard to decision making quality (score on task). Group decision making is achievable through CMC despite <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> and absence of face-to-face or voice communication. <b>Delayed</b> <b>time</b> groups took longer to reach closure on the task than real time groups. Real time groups exchanged more messages than <b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> groups. There were no significant differences between CMC groups in regard to the number of sentences and words exchanged. <b>Delayed</b> <b>time</b> groups produced text that was of higher readability quality. However, it was discovered that short text exchanges by groups from both CMC modes influenced the readability analysis, thus misleading true text readability grade levels under CMC modes. It was recommended that future research is needed to provide further insight as to why users would choose to use <b>delayed</b> <b>time</b> computer communication versus real time computer communication. This will become increasingly important to ascertain as more end-users increase their utilization of interactive computer mediated communication, now a standard feature offered under multi-user and multi-tasking operating system environments...|$|R
40|$|Shock tubes have {{conventionally}} {{been used}} for measuring high-temperature ignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> ~ O(1 ms). In {{the last decade or}} so, the operating regime of shock tubes has been extended to lower temperatures by accessing longer observation times. Such measurements may potentially be affected by some non-ideal phenomena. The purpose of this work is to measure long ignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> for fuels exhibiting negative temperature coefficient (NTC) and {{to assess the impact of}} shock tube non-idealities on ignition delay data. Ignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> of n-heptane and n-hexane were measured over the temperature range of 650 – 1250 K and pressures near 1. 5 atm. Driver gas tailoring and long length of shock tube driver section were utilized to measure ignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> as long as 32 ms. Measured ignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> agree with chemical kinetic models at high (> 1100 K) and low (< 700 K) temperatures. In the intermediate temperature range (700 – 1100 K), however, significant discrepancies are observed between the measurements and homogeneous ignition delay simulations. It is postulated, based on experimental observations, that localized ignition kernels could affect the ignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> at the intermediate temperatures, which lead to compression (and heating) of the bulk gas and result in expediting the overall ignition event. The postulate is validated through simple representative computational fluid dynamic simulations of post-shock gas mixtures which exhibit ignition advancement via a hot spot. The results of the current work show that ignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> measured by shock tubes may be affected by non-ideal phenomena for certain conditions of temperature, pressure and fuel reactivity. Care must, therefore, be exercised in using such data for chemical kinetic model development and validation...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: To examine recent data, and temporal trends therein, about duration of prehospital delay in a large (N = 364, 131) cross-sectional sample of patients included in the second National Registry of Myocardial Infarction. METHODS: The medical records of patients hospitalized with AMI in 1624 US hospitals from June 1, 1994, to October 31, 1997, were reviewed for information about duration of prehospital delay. RESULTS: There was evidence of a slight decline in average <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> in patients hospitalized in 1997 (5. 5 hours) compared with those hospitalized in 1994 (5. 7 hours). Median <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> (2. 1 hours) did not change.
