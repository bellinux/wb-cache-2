40|$|Abstract. Recent work in {{psychology}} <b>has</b> <b>leveraged</b> <b>the</b> power of Virtual Reality (VR) {{to study the}} deterioration of navigation abilities in the elderly.

We present a system, the Spatial Navigation Paradigm (SNaP) framework, which can be used to implement a battery of spatial navigation paradigms. This framework integrates a popular VR environment development platform with an extensible representation medium to allow for the precise control of paradigms, the switching between input and output devices, and the recording of accurate behavioral measurements. A preliminary study of the framework indicates that novice and expert VR users are able to quickly and easily specify and deploy experiments and that expert VR users can easily modify and extend existing paradigm implementations...|$|E

40|$|Recent work in {{learning}} ontologies (hierarchical and partially-ordered structures) <b>has</b> <b>leveraged</b> <b>the</b> intrinsic geometry of spaces of learned representations to make predictions that automatically obey complex structural constraints. We explore two extensions {{of one such}} model, the order-embedding model for hierarchical relation learning, with an aim towards improved performance on text data for commonsense knowledge representation. Our first model jointly learns ordering relations and non-hierarchical knowledge {{in the form of}} raw text. Our second extension exploits the partial order structure of the training data to find long-distance triplet constraints among embeddings which are poorly enforced by the pairwise training procedure. We find that both incorporating free text and augmented training constraints improve over the original order-embedding model and other strong baselines.

40|$|Subspace {{learning}} {{techniques for}} text analysis, such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), {{have been widely}} studied in the past decade. However, to our best knowledge, no previous study <b>has</b> <b>leveraged</b> <b>the</b> rank information for subspace learning in ranking tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called Learning Latent Semantics for Ranking (LLSR), to seek the optimal Latent Semantic Space tailored to the ranking tasks. We first present a dual explanation for the classical Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) algorithm, namely learning the so-called Latent Semantic Space (LSS) to encode the data information. Then, to handle the increasing amount of training data for the practical ranking tasks, we propose a novel objective function to derive the optimal LSS for ranking. Experimental results on two SMART sub-collections and a TREC dataset show that LLSR effectively improves the ranking performance compared with the classical LSI algorithm and ranking without subspace learning...|$|E

40|$|Progress in the Machine Translation (MT) {{research}} community, {{particularly for}} statistical approaches, is intensely data-driven. Acquiring source language documents for testing, creating training datasets for customized MT lexicons, and building parallel corpora for MT evaluation require translators and non-native speaking analysts to handle large document collections. These collections are {{further complicated by}} differences in format, encoding, source media, and access to metadata describing the documents. Automated tools that allow language professionals to quickly annotate, translate, and evaluate foreign language documents are essential to improving MT quality and efficacy. The {{purpose of this paper}} is present our research approach to improving MT through pre-processing source language documents. In particular, we will discuss the development and use of MTriage, an application environment that enables the translator to markup documents with metadata for MT parameterization and routing.

40|$|Today the {{printing}} industry {{is no longer}} an industry comprised of companies that just put ink on paper. Many printing companies are restructuring themselves as marketing service providers. Digital technology <b>has</b> <b>leveraged</b> <b>the</b> industry to utilize cross-media solutions to deliver messages to various targeted audiences. Although personalization is not something new, personalization is one of the growing trends in {{the printing}} industry. Effective use of personalized communication has helped get better response in marketing campaigns as compared to a static communication piece (Gorelick, 2010). Companies have used personalized communication to deliver specific messages to their target audiences, yet no significant studies have been done to understand the factors (if any) that influence the 18 - to 25 -year-old demographic. This study investigates how this demographic group responds to personalized communication and the factors, if any, that influence their decision process in buying products or services from different companies.

There were 143 participants of age 18 -to 25 that participated in the survey. The data from the survey indicated that 62. 2...|$|E
40|$|Survivors of {{childhood}} cancer carry a substantial burden of morbidity and are {{at increased risk}} for premature death. Furthermore, clear associations exist between specific therapeutic exposures and the risk for a variety of long-term complications. The entire landscape of health issues encountered for decades after successful completion of treatment is currently being explored in various collaborative research settings. These settings include large population-based or multi-institutional cohorts and single-institution studies. The ascertainment of outcomes has depended on self-reporting, linkage to registries, or clinical assessments. Survivorship research in the cooperative group setting, such as the Children's Oncology Group, <b>has</b> <b>leveraged</b> <b>the</b> clinical trials infrastructure to explore the molecular underpinnings of treatment-related adverse events, and to understand specific complications in the setting of randomized risk-reduction strategies.
