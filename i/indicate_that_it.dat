5|$|Dimorphodon {{has been}} envisioned as a puffin {{analogue}} in the past, but its jaw structure and gait, combined with its poor flight capabilities, <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a terrestrial/semiarboreal feeder. It {{seems to have}} been a predator of small mammals and squamates, and possibly also preyed on large insects.|$|E

50|$|Very limited {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} the Haynesville Shale <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is fossiliferous. The reported fossils include unidentified coccoliths, bivalves, gastropods, and calcispheres. Both stratigraphic relationships and a nannofossil (coccolith) assemblage described from <b>it</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is Kimmeridgian, 151 to 157 million years old, in age.|$|R

5|$|No fossil {{evidence}} of Dimetrodons skin {{has yet been}} found. Impressions of {{the skin of a}} related animal, Estemmenosuchus, <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would have been smooth and well-provided with glands. Dimetrodon also may have had large scutes on the underside of its tail and belly, as other synapsids did.|$|E
5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse is {{now found}} only in the Mikea Forest of southwestern Madagascar, but subfossil records <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> used to be more widely {{distributed}} in southern Madagascar. Climatic changes and competition with introduced species {{may have led to}} the shift in its distribution. The Mikea Forest, the only place where it is still known to occur, is threatened by human development.|$|E
5|$|Si Ronda was {{released}} in 1930; Effendi stated that it {{was released}} before Tan's Nancy Bikin Pembalesan (Nancy Takes Revenge), a sequel to Njai Dasima, began screening in May 1930. Dutch newspapers <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had screened in Medan, North Sumatra, by 1932. Biran writes that the film received little coverage; he notes that Sinematek Indonesia has no news clippings related to Si Ronda.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} which respiratory viruses circulate among confined dogs, we analyzed nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens from shelter dogs with acute respiratory disease. An unknown virus was isolated. Monoclonal antibody testing <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was probably a}} pneumovirus. PCR and sequence analysis <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was closely related to murine pneumovirus...|$|R
50|$|Justice Bradley {{strongly}} dissented {{from the}} decision, <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> practically overturned Munn v.

5|$|Since {{at least}} some of Tyrannosauruss {{potential}} prey could move quickly, evidence that it walked instead of ran could <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a scavenger. On the other hand, recent analyses suggest that Tyrannosaurus, while slower than large modern terrestrial predators, may well have been fast enough to prey on large hadrosaurs and ceratopsians.|$|E
5|$|The 1910 {{edition of}} St. Elmo by Hurst & Company is {{sometimes}} marked {{as having been}} drawn from a movie. This is incorrect, {{it was designed to}} appeal to theater patrons and copyrighted in January 1910. Another 1910 publication by M.A Donahue includes photographs marked as having been produced by Lawrence Co. of Chicago. It does not <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is from the Thanhouser production.|$|E
5|$|The {{brown creeper}} has {{sometimes}} been {{considered to be a}} subspecies of Eurasian treecreeper, but has closer affinities to short-toed treecreeper, and is normally now treated as a full species. Hodgson's treecreeper is a more recent proposed split following studies of its cytochrome b mtDNA sequence and song structure that <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may well be a distinct species from C. familiaris.|$|E
25|$|In the tables, the hyphen has two {{different}} meanings. A hyphen after the letter <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{must be at}} the beginning of a syllable, e.g. j- in jumper and ajar.

5|$|The neck {{vertebra}} {{referred to}} Hatzegopteryx sp. contains {{a number of}} traits that allow {{for it to be}} definitely identified as that of an azhdarchid. The centrum is relatively low, the zygapophyses are large and flattened, and the preserved portions of the neural spine <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is bifid, or split into two.|$|E
5|$|The {{teeth of}} Herrerasaurus <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a carnivore; its size {{indicates}} {{it would have}} preyed upon small and medium-sized plant eaters. These might have included other dinosaurs, such as Pisanosaurus, {{as well as the}} more plentiful rhynchosaurs and synapsids. Herrerasaurus itself may have been preyed upon by giant rauisuchids like Saurosuchus; puncture wounds were found in one skull.|$|E
5|$|Verbalisation {{involves}} re-analysing {{the entire}} coverb - including its suffix -ma, which serves merely to <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is unmarked for aspect - as a verb root, {{and then to}} apply the usual obligatory verbal inflection affixes for person, number and tense. As there is no discrete morpheme {{that serves as a}} 'verbaliser', the process is one of conversion.|$|E

5|$|It {{is known}} from {{abundant}} skeletal elements, which document {{it as the}} largest known oryzomyine, on par with Megalomys desmarestii, another Antillean endemic. Its morphological features <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is distinct from Megalomys, which includes various other Antillean oryzomyines, and derives from a separate colonization of the Lesser Antilles by oryzomyines. In the original description, it was placed close to a species now placed in Nephelomys, but its relationships have not been studied since.|$|E
5|$|Like other abelisaurs where {{material}} from the forelimbs is available, the arms and hands of Limusaurus were considerably reduced, {{even more so than}} that of Ceratosaurus. The first finger was smaller than the other fingers and lacked digits entirely. As for the other fingers, the second finger was very robust and had three digits, the third finger only had three digits as opposed to four in other early theropods, and the preserved portions of the fourth finger <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was comparatively long and slender, terminating in a single digit. The claws were short, stout, and expanded at their base.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{the most}} {{extensive}} collection of phonetic data so far in Mongolian studies {{has been applied to}} a partial account of stress placement in the closely related Chakhar dialect. The conclusion is drawn that di- and trisyllabic words with a short first syllable are stressed on the second syllable. But if their first syllable is long, then the data for different acoustic parameters seems to support conflicting conclusions: intensity data often seems to indicate that the first syllable is stressed, while F0 seems to <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is the second syllable that is stressed.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent {{measurements}} of Vega at 193μm showed a lower than expected flux for the hypothesized particles, {{suggesting that they}} must instead be {{on the order of}} 100μm or less. To maintain this amount of dust in orbit around Vega, a continual source of replenishment would be required. A proposed mechanism for maintaining the dust was a disk of coalesced bodies that {{were in the process of}} collapsing to form a planet. Models fitted to the dust distribution around Vega <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a 120AU-radius circular disk viewed from nearly pole-on. In addition, there is a hole in the center of the disk with a radius of no less than 80AU.|$|E
5|$|The Hollow Moon hypothesis, or Spaceship Moon hypothesis, {{proposes that}} Earth's Moon is either wholly hollow or {{otherwise}} contains a substantial interior space. No scientific evidence exists {{to support the}} idea; seismic observations and other data collected since spacecraft began to orbit or land on the Moon <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has a thin crust, extensive mantle and small, dense core, although overall it is much less dense than Earth.|$|E
5|$|The dog conch is an {{economically}} important {{species in the}} Indo-West Pacific, and several studies <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may be suffering population declines due to overfishing and overexploitation. Malacologists and ecologists have recommended a reduction in its exploitation rate; initiatives in Thailand are attempting to ensure the possibility of reproduction in young-adult individuals and manage the natural populations in general. L.canarium demonstrates the imposex phenomenon, but is resistant to sterility caused by it; therefore, {{it has been suggested}} that this species might be useful as a bioindicator for organotin pollution monitoring near Malaysian ports.|$|E
