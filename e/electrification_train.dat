For that purpose locomotives were stabled in the Bahnbetriebswerk at Röblingen am See for 120 years.|$|R
50|$|The Série 1900 {{locomotives}} of Portuguese Railways are 13 {{diesel-electric locomotives}} built in 1981 for freight duties. Prior to <b>electrification,</b> coal <b>trains</b> were hauled by triple-headed Série 1900 locomotives inland from the Port of Sines. The locomotives were built by Sorefame under licence from the French company Alsthom and are visually similar to SNCF Class CC 72000. They have {{a top speed}} of 100 km/h.|$|R

50|$|The {{branch line}} had a {{chequered}} history, {{linked to the}} Crystal Palace's own precarious financial position, with two periods of closure. Wartime economies led to the line closing from 1917 to 1919. After this first closure, trains from Holborn Viaduct railway station in the City were not reinstated. However, the branch was electrified, {{as part of a}} Southern Railway scheme, on 12 July 1925. After <b>electrification</b> all <b>trains</b> operated to Blackfriars and Holborn Viaduct.|$|R

40|$|The {{professional}} {{implementation of}} rural electricity {{projects for the}} minimization of risks is discussed. Companies and institutions which want to implement rural electrification are confronted with four-dimensional problem matrices regarding technical, financial, economic, and social aspects. It is stated that rural electrification are successful only when social factors such as income and background knowledge of users, culturally appropriate financing models and maintenance by local technicians are taken into account. Besides the establishment of regional expertise for rural <b>electrification</b> via <b>training</b> measures, technical quality assurance of components is another cornerstone for establishing successful markets...|$|R
50|$|Additional {{services}} are provided during Henley Regatta {{at the beginning}} of July, with longer trains. All {{services are}} operated by Western Railway (GWR), using Class 165/166 Turbo diesel multiple units. Upon completion of <b>electrification,</b> Class 387 <b>trains</b> will be used, while the Turbos will be displaced {{to other parts of the}} GWR network.|$|R
50|$|The fixed {{bearer network}} {{is at the}} core of railway {{communications}} and thus is vital to the operation of the railway. It provides essential circuits for signalling and <b>electrification</b> control systems, <b>train</b> radio systems, lineside communications, level crossing CCTV, and customer information systems as well as more general IT and business telephony needs.|$|R
2500|$|All 15 {{stations}} were built with island platforms. The trains were thus built with doors {{on one side}} only. Power for the electric lighting in the trains was supplied by two parallel wall-mounted rails (known as [...] "T-irons") at window level on the non-platform side of the trains; trains were originally equipped with wheels {{to pick up the}} electricity but changed to skids at <b>electrification.</b> The <b>trains</b> remained cable-hauled until 1935, though the anachronistic way of supplying power for the lighting continued until 1977. The lighting circuit was also part of the operation of the signalling system.|$|R
50|$|Electrification of the 636 km long Mughasarai-Moradabad {{line was}} {{completed}} in 2013. Many trains on the Ambala and Lucknow line run with electric locomotives (including Freight <b>trains).</b> <b>Electrification</b> of the Delhi-Moradabad line {{was completed in}} 2015.

50|$|Road n' Rail service {{ended on}} October 15, 1982. Service at Jamesport ended on April 30, 1984 because of limited patronage. An {{additional}} factor {{that contributed to}} its closure was the electrification of the Main Line from Hicksville to Ronkonkoma. Periodic midday service suspension on the Main Line east of Hicksville to accommodate work on <b>electrification</b> brought few <b>trains</b> to the East End.|$|R
500|$|Parson Street {{is on the}} Weston-super-Mare/ corridor, one of {{the main}} axes of MetroWest, a rail {{transport}} plan which aims to enhance transport capacity in the Bristol area. As part of this scheme, the Portishead Branch Line, which runs along {{the south side of the}} River Avon from a junction just beyond Parson Street, will be reopened. The line was built in the 1860s, but closed to passenger traffic in 1964, leaving Portishead as one of Britain's largest towns without a railway station. The line was reopened for freight traffic to serve Royal Portbury Docks in 2002. The scheme was given the go-ahead in July 2012 as part of the City Deal, whereby local councils would be given greater control over money by the government. A consultation on the plans was held between 22 June and 3 August 2015 to gather views from the community and stakeholders before moving on to detailed designs. The detailed proposals will be subject to a second consultation before the plans are finalised. Due to the additional capital costs, the line will not be electrified, however the design will include passive provision for future <b>electrification.</b> <b>Trains</b> along the reopened line will operate between [...] and Bristol Temple Meads, with two trains per hour in each direction. Services would call at [...] and Parson Street, with aspirations to also call at [...] and a reopened [...] Trains could also be extended on to the Severn Beach Line. The line will be operated as part of the Greater Western passenger franchise, with services due to start in Spring 2019.|$|R
50|$|Also, {{unlike other}} rapid transit {{networks}} in Japan, most Osaka subway lines use a third rail <b>electrification</b> system for <b>trains.</b> Only three lines use overhead catenary: the Sakaisuji Line, to accommodate through services on Hankyu trackage; and the linear-motor Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi and Imazatosuji Lines. Also unusually, all lines use standard gauge; {{there are no}} narrow gauge sections of track due to the network being almost entirely self-enclosed.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} Northern Hub scheme; {{electrification}} of key lines {{will enable}} faster electric trains increasing capacity and lowering journey times. Typically, diesel trains that operated between Manchester and Liverpool such as the Class 142 and Class 156 had a maximum speed limit of 75 mph. Following <b>electrification,</b> Class 319 <b>trains</b> reach {{a top speed of}} 100 mph with greater acceleration from stations.|$|R
5000|$|From the 1920s, the Southern Railway of the UK and its {{predecessor}} companies had adopted <b>electrification</b> and multiple-unit <b>train</b> operation {{as a solution}} for dense and intensive passenger service requirements. The fleet prior to World War II used the two-pipe Westinghouse Air Brake system, which was {{more effective than the}} generally prevailing vacuum brake then in favour in the UK. However it had disadvantages, chiefly: ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1961, {{with the}} Kent Coast <b>electrification</b> scheme, the <b>train</b> became electric-hauled. This allowed an {{acceleration}} to 80 {{minutes for the}} down service and 82 minutes for the up service. [...] A decline in demand for rail travel between London and Paris saw the last Golden Arrow run on 30 September 1972, and in its later years only the first class section was advertised as a Pullman service.|$|R
2500|$|Hitachi gained further {{ground in}} the UK market when it was {{announced}} that an A-train based design {{similar to that of the}} Class 395, initially named the [...] "Hitachi Super Express", won the United Kingdom Government's Intercity Express Programme tender. The order covers up to 1,400 new multiple unit vehicles, commissioned as five- and nine-car sets. The Class 801 EMU sets will operate only on electrified sections of the network, and the Class 800 EDMU (electro-diesel multiple unit) [...] "bi-mode" [...] sets will be powered by AC overhead where available and underfloor diesel generators beyond the extents of <b>electrification.</b> The <b>train</b> specification allows for the conversion of Class 800 to Class 801, as it is assumed that electrification will continue to expand.|$|R
