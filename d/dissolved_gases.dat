5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS; {{also known}} as divers' disease, the bends or caisson disease) describes a condition arising from <b>dissolved</b> <b>gases</b> coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation. DCS most commonly refers to problems arising from underwater diving decompression (i.e., during ascent), but may be experienced in other depressurisation events such as emerging from a caisson, flying in an unpressurised aircraft at altitude, and extravehicular activity from spacecraft. DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness.|$|E
5|$|Magma {{sitting in}} an {{underground}} chamber for many years will start to see higher melting point constituents such as olivine crystallizing out. The effect {{is to increase the}} concentration of <b>dissolved</b> <b>gases</b> (mostly sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide) in the remaining liquid magma, making the subsequent eruption more violent. As gas-rich magma approaches the surface during an eruption, the huge drop in internal pressure caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock (which drops to zero at the surface) causes the gases to come out of solution, the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma. Additionally, the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of felsic components such as silicates potentially making the magma more viscous, adding to the explosive nature of the eruption.|$|E

30|$|The {{mechanism}} of gas flow in nanopores {{is one of}} the major focuses in shale reservoir research. The interaction between gas molecules and solid walls becomes so significant that we have to consider this effect on flow mechanisms. There are three types of gas stored in shale reservoirs: free gas (just like the gas in conventional reservoirs), adsorbed gas near the solid wall surfaces and <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> within the organic materials (kerogen). Each type of gas possesses different flow mechanisms. The <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> in kerogen is immovable and structured as the rock solid matrix. When the pressure decreases, <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> will release, leading to the shrinkage of the solid matrix and increment of porosity and permeability. There are lots of studies of this effect in coalbed methane reservoirs, but there are only limited studies for shale and the percentage of <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> is questionable. Etminan et al. (2014) measured the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> in a shale sample using a pressure decay method and reported that the contribution of <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> (methane) was about 22 % of the total gas in place at 4.5  MPa and the adsorbed gas contributed about 38 %. Jin and Firoozabadi (2016) adopted the solid-solution model for wax and asphaltene precipitation (Pan and Firoozabadi 1997; Won 1986) to model the gas dissolution in kerogen. The kerogen is believed to be similar to bitumen or solid heavy oil (Mehrabi et al. 2017; Jin and Firoozabadi 2016; Yang et al. 2016). According to Yang et al. (2016), <b>gas</b> <b>dissolves</b> into the organic matter just as natural <b>gas</b> <b>dissolves</b> into heavy oil and gas dissolution in the organic material (kerogen) delays the adsorption process. In Jin and Firoozabadi’s study, the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> contribution to the total sorbed gas (methane) was approximately 7 % at 4.5  MPa (Jin and Firoozabadi 2016), which is much smaller than the value reported by Etminan et al. (2014). They also reported an approximately linear relationship between the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> volume and pressure. Divided by the total organic content (TOC) values, the normalized <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> volume was obtained and the slopes of the normalized <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> volume with respect to pressure for different samples are the same. Mehrabi et al. (2017) fully reviewed the studies related to <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> and established a model for simulating gas flow in non-circular pores. Their results supported the significance of <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> in shale reservoir production. Heller and Zoback (2014) measured the volumetric swelling strain due to sorption as a function of pressure. In their studies, the volumetric swelling strain is approximately linearly proportional to pressure, especially for methane. All in all, we assume the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> volume is approximately linearly proportional to pressure, which can be formulated by the Henry equation.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} of microceullular plastics {{is dependent on}} temperature and pressure. <b>Dissolving</b> <b>gas</b> under high temperature and pressure creates a driving force that activates nucleation sites when the pressure drops, which increases exponentially with amount of <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{combined}} {{concentrations of}} gases {{in any given}} tissue depend {{on the history of}} pressure and gas composition. Under equilibrium conditions, the total concentration of <b>dissolved</b> <b>gases</b> is less than the ambient pressure—as oxygen is metabolized in the tissues, and the carbon dioxide produced is much more soluble. However, during a reduction in ambient pressure, the rate of pressure reduction may exceed the rate at which gas is eliminated by diffusion and perfusion. If the concentration gets too high, it may reach a stage where bubble formation can occur in the supersaturated tissues. When the pressure of gases in a bubble exceed the combined external pressures of ambient pressure and the surface tension of the bubble-liquid interface, the bubbles grow, and this growth can damage tissue.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{consists}} of fragments of pulverized rock, minerals and volcanic glass, created during volcanic eruptions and measuring less than 2mm (0.079inches) in diameter. The term volcanic ash is also often loosely {{used to refer}} to all explosive eruption products (correctly referred to as tephra), including particles larger than 2mm. Volcanic ash is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions when <b>dissolved</b> <b>gases</b> in magma expand and escape violently into the atmosphere. The force of the escaping gas shatters the magma and propels it into the atmosphere where it solidifies into fragments of volcanic rock and glass. Ash is also produced when magma comes into contact with water during phreatomagmatic eruptions, causing the water to explosively flash to steam leading to shattering of magma. Once in the air, ash is transported by wind up to thousands of kilometers away.|$|E
5|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characteristics of volcanic ash are primarily {{controlled by the}} style of volcanic eruption. Volcanoes display a range of eruption styles which are controlled by magma chemistry, crystal content, temperature and <b>dissolved</b> <b>gases</b> of the erupting magma and can be classified using the volcanic explosivity index (VEI). Effusive eruptions (VEI 1) of basaltic composition produce <105 m3 of ejecta, whereas extremely explosive eruptions (VEI 5+) of rhyolitic and dacitic composition can inject large quantities (>109 m3) of ejecta into the atmosphere. Another parameter controlling the amount of ash produced is {{the duration of the}} eruption: the longer the eruption is sustained, the more ash will be produced. For example, {{the second phase of the}} 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull was classified as VEI 4 despite a modest 8 km high eruption column, but the eruption continued for a month, which allowed a large volume of ash to be ejected into the atmosphere.|$|E

When one is suddenly wrecked or meets a tsunami, one is instantly drowned and cannot breathe under water. To avoid this crisis, when we meet waves, the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> separated from water by wave is used, while air can be used to breathe when we are about to escape from water. In this thesis, we investigated the separation characteristics of <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> using the pipe type of hollow fiber membrane with polypropylene and the nude type of one with polysulfone. The hollow fiber membranes with good characteristics under water are used to separate the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas.</b> The hollow fiber membranes with good characteristics in an air are used to transfer air. The combination of membranes with good separation characteristics under water and good transferring one in an air is used to breathe instantly under water to be alive at crisis.

For this purpose, a storage tank is installed from which DM water is continuously withdrawn for boiler make-up. The storage tank for DM water is made from materials not affected by corrosive water, such as PVC. The piping and valves are generally of stainless steel. Sometimes, a steam blanketing arrangement or stainless steel doughnut float is provided {{on top of the}} water in the tank to avoid contact with air. DM water make-up is generally added at the steam space of the surface condenser (i.e., the vacuum side). This arrangement not only sprays the water but also DM water gets deaerated, with the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gases</b> being removed by a de-aerator through an ejector attached to the condenser.|$|E

25|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure the body tissues are therefore normally saturated with nitrogen at 0.758bar (569mmHg). At increased ambient pressures due to depth or habitat pressurisation, a diver's lungs {{are filled with}} breathing gas at the increased pressure, and the partial pressures of the constituent gases will be increased proportionately. The inert gases from the breathing gas in the lungs diffuse into blood in the alveolar capillaries and are distributed around the body by the systemic circulation in the process known as perfusion. Dissolved materials are transported in the blood much faster {{than they would be}} distributed by diffusion alone. From the systemic capillaries the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gases</b> diffuse through the cell membranes and into the tissues, where it may eventually reach equilibrium. The greater the blood supply to a tissue, the faster it will reach equilibrium with gas at the new partial pressure. This equilibrium is called saturation. Ingassing appears to follow a simple inverse exponential equation. The time it takes for a tissue to take up or release 50% of the difference in dissolved gas capacity at a changed partial pressure is called the half-time for that tissue and gas.|$|E
