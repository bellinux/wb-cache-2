In order to realize the ideals of public participation in <b>environmental</b> <b>protection,</b> we need to enhance the democratization of national administrative agencies, guarantee the civil environmental rights, balance {{the environment}}al interests of different groups in light of environmental justice, promote public environmental awareness and cultivate the self-governing spirit in <b>environmental</b> <b>protection.</b> As there are definitely many problems in the public participation of <b>environmental</b> <b>protection,</b> we need to strengthen education in <b>environmental</b> <b>protection,</b> promote public participation in <b>environmental</b> <b>protection</b> and provide support to the civil environmental organizations so as to realize public participation in <b>environmental</b> <b>protection...</b>|$|R

50|$|Formal <b>environmental</b> <b>protection</b> in China House {{was first}} {{stimulated by the}} 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm, Sweden. Following this, they began {{establishing}} <b>environmental</b> <b>protection</b> agencies and putting controls on some of its industrial waste. China {{was one of the}} first developing countries to implement a sustainable development strategy. In 1983 the State Council announced that <b>environmental</b> <b>protection</b> would be one of China's basic national policies and in 1984 the National <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> Agency (NEPA) was established. Following severe flooding of the Yangtze River basin in 1998, NEPA was upgraded to the State <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> Agency (SEPA) meaning that <b>environmental</b> <b>protection</b> was now being implemented at a ministerial level. In 2008, SEPA became known by its current name of Ministry of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> of the People's Republic of China (MEP).|$|R

3000|$|The third {{motivation}} {{came from}} the administrative system of <b>environmental</b> <b>protection.</b> In 1974, the State Council set up a leading group to protect the environment, consisting of leaders from more than 20 ministries and commissions. There was also an office beneath the leading group, which was China’s first <b>environmental</b> <b>protection</b> institution. In 1982, during institutional reform, the leading group was dismissed and the office was incorporated into the Ministry of Urban and Rural Construction and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> and was renamed as the Bureau of Environment Protection (Zhang, 2013 : 95). In 1984, the State Council set up the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> Committee and the Bureau of Environment Protection was renamed as the State Bureau of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection,</b> which was the executive office for the State Council <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> Committee. In 1998, State Bureau of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> was strengthened and the institution was changed into the Ministry of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> in 2008. <b>Environmental</b> <b>protection</b> has gained more attention in the state, {{as shown by the}} continuous developments of the national <b>environmental</b> <b>protection</b> administrative institutions (Xu, 2012 : 8). However, descriptive institutional upgrade does not necessarily mean substantive power expansion. This gap became an internal driving force behind the legal amendment. As mentioned in ‘the Amendment of the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> Law of the People's Republic of China (draft)’, ‘it is imperative to revise the existing <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> Law, which is to promote the law implementation and to hold the administrative offices accountable. The government should perform better in supervision and the legal liability must be strengthened.’ [...]...|$|R
