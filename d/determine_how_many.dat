5|$|The {{game has}} local two-player {{multiplayer}} with a divided iPad screen, and asynchronous online multiplayer where players construct levels for their opponents to complete. Players spin a wheel {{at the beginning}} of their turn to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> hazards they get to place via drag and drop. A few of the items are unlocked at first, and more are available with progress through the game or in-app purchases. Gasketball uses a colorful palette and features a cranky robot, who provides a tutorial and resets the ball. It was released as free-to-play with the tutorial unlocked, and four to five chapters available as additional paid downloads.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{dissection}} puzzle {{similar to}} a Tangram, and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the Archimedes Palimpsest. Archimedes calculates {{the areas of the}} 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a square. Research published by Dr. Reviel Netz of Stanford University in 2003 argued that Archimedes was attempting to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> ways the pieces could be assembled into the shape of a square. Dr. Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a square 17,152 ways. The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and reflection have been excluded. The puzzle represents an example of an early problem in combinatorics.|$|E
5|$|Other dinosaurs {{from these}} {{formations}} include the genasaur Lesothosaurus, the basal sauropodomorph Massospondylus, and the theropod Megapnosaurus. The Lower Elliot Formation shows the largest known heterodontosaurid diversity of any rock unit; besides Heterodontosaurus, it contained Lycorhinus, Abrictosaurus, and Pegomastax. Yet {{another member of}} the family, Geranosaurus, is known from the Clarens Formation. The high heterodontosaurid diversity have led researchers to conclude that different species might have fed on separate food sources in order to avoid competition (niche partitioning). With its highly specialised dentition, Heterodontosaurus might have been specialised for tough plant material, while the less specialised Abrictosaurus might have predominantly consumed softer vegetation. The position of the individual heterodontosaurid specimens within the rock succession is poorly known, making it difficult to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of these species really were conspecific, and which species existed at separate times.|$|E

5|$|North Korean {{casualties}} for {{the battle}} are {{almost impossible to}} estimate precisely {{due to a lack}} of records. It is difficult to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> South Korean citizens were forcibly conscripted during the battle and how many deserted as opposed to being killed. Larger engagements destroyed entire regiments and even divisions of North Korean troops, and their strength had to be estimated based on accounts of North Koreans captured by the UN. On September 1, the North Korean army numbered approximately 97,850 in South Korea, and up to one third of this number is suspected to have been conscripts from South Korea. In the aftermath of the Pusan Perimeter battle, only 25,000 or 30,000 of these soldiers returned to North Korea by the end of the month. Upwards of one third of the attacking force became casualties in the fighting. This would mean North Korean casualties from September 1 to 15 could range from roughly 41,000 to 36,000 killed and captured, with an unknown number of wounded. With the addition of the 5,690 killed in the Bowling Alley, 3,500 at the Naktong Bulge, at least 3,700 at Taegu and an unknown number at P'ohang-dong before September 1, North Korean casualties likely topped 50,000 to 60,000 by the end of the battle. They also lost 239 T-34 tanks and 74 SU-76 self-propelled guns; virtually all of the armor they possessed.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the ambulance mechanical problems, DCFEMS began having trouble staffing its ambulances properly in 2012 as well. The firefighters' union accused Ellerbe of mismanaging the emergency services division (which includes both paramedics and EMTs), and said that 37 emergency medical staff quit between January 2011 and December 2012. In December 2012, during hearings on the issue, City Council member Mendelson said that DCFEMS could not accurately <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> paramedics and EMTs it had on staff, as departmental figures provided various numbers between 225 and 250.|$|E
25|$|In the past, remains {{have been}} {{attributed}} to the same genus as the Judith River Troodon {{from a wide variety of}} other geological formations. It is now recognized as unlikely that all of these fossils, which come from localities hundreds or thousands of miles apart, separated by millions of years of time, represent a single species or genus of troodontid dinosaurs. Further study and more fossils are needed to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> species of Troodon existed. It is questionable that, after further study, any additional species can be referred to Troodon, in which case the genus would be considered a nomen dubium.|$|E
25|$|Mitochondrial DNA {{can be used}} {{to trace}} the ancestry of a set of populations. In this case, populations are defined by the {{accumulation}} of mutations on the mtDNA, and special trees are created for the mutations and the order in which they occurred in each population. The tree is formed through the testing {{of a large number of}} individuals all over the world for the presence or lack of a certain set of mutations. Once this is done it is possible to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> mutations separate one population from another. The number of mutations, together with estimated mutation rate of the mtDNA in the regions tested, allows scientists to determine the approximate time to MRCA (TMRCA) which indicates time passed since the populations last shared the same set of mutations or belonged to the same haplogroup.|$|E

25|$|That project {{endeavors to}} present all the {{phenomena}} in society that are perceived negatively by groups transcending national frontiers. Those phenomena constitute {{a challenge to}} creative remedial action. Groups are strongly motivated by the problems that infringe their values and arouse their indignation. As such, problems are a major stimulus driving the development of society. Although there is agreement that problems are numerous and that many are really serious, little effort {{has been made to}} <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> problems there are. Likewise, while it is becoming increasingly evident that problems interact with one another, and constitute complex networks or systems, little effort has been made to map that complexity. The perceptions documented in that project raise useful questions concerning the nature and existence of problems, especially when other groups consider that one perception or another is irrelevant, misleading or misinformed. An aim of that research area, then, is to assemble information whose significance is collectively repressed, displaced onto some less threatening problems, or projected in the form of blame onto some other social group.|$|E

500|$|The two central {{characters}} {{can fight}} off and defeat spirits using the series' recurring Camera Obscura, a camera that captures spirits. Shots {{taken by the}} Camera Obscura deal varying amounts of damage based on how close the ghost is, {{the angle of the}} shot, and the film used. These factors are taken together to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> points the player is awarded for a shot. The most damaging type of shot is the [...] "Fatal Frame", which is achieved if a shot is taken when the ghost is attacking. Points are used as the in-game currency, which can be used to at save points to purchase items such as medicine and other items. Blue gems scattered around the environment can be used to upgrade the Camera Obscura, with some upgrades speeding reload time or enabling shots to deal more damage. Types of film range from an unlimited low-quality film that deals little damage to rarer and more powerful film types.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1990s, the New Age {{was found}} {{primarily}} in the United States and Canada, Western Europe, and Australia and New Zealand. The fact that most individuals engaging in New Age activity do not describe themselves as [...] "New Agers" [...] renders it difficult to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> practitioners there are. Heelas highlighted the range of attempts to establish the number of New Age participants in the U.S. during this period, noting that estimates ranged from 20,000 to 6 million; {{he believed that the}} higher ranges of these estimates were greatly inflated by, for instance, an erroneous assumption that all Americans who believed in reincarnation were part of the movement. He nevertheless suggested that over 10 million people in the U.S. had had some contact with New Age practices or ideas. In 2006, Heelas stated that New Age practices had grown {{to such an extent that}} they were [...] "increasingly rivalling the sway of Christianity in western settings".|$|E

500|$|Western Armenia {{refers to}} an {{undefined}} area, now in eastern Turkey, that had significant Armenian population prior to the Armenian Genocide of 1915. As {{a result of the}} genocide, officially no Armenians live in the area today. However, at least two groups of Armenian origin reside in the area. Hemshin peoples, a islamisized group with Armenian ethnic origin, live in the Black Sea coast, particularity in the Rize province. Another group, Crypto-Armenians or [...] "secret" [...] Armenians, live throughout Turkey, especially the eastern parts of the country. It is impossible to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> there are due to this(the fact they keep their identity hidden). estimates range from millions to the low 100,000s depending on the criteria used to determine it. since the Armenian Genocide, the area has been mostly inhabited by Kurds and Turks, with smaller numbers of Azerbaijanis (near the Turkish-Armenian border) and Georgians and Laz people in the northeastern provinces of Turkey.|$|E
500|$|The Congressional Budget Office and a {{broad range}} of economists credit Obama's {{stimulus}} plan for economic growth. The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1million, while conceding that [...] "It is impossible to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of the reported jobs would have existed {{in the absence of the}} stimulus package." [...] Although an April 2010 survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73% of 68 respondents believed that the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment. The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of World War II. The OECD credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus in the United States and the austerity measures in the European Union.|$|E
500|$|Though it is {{impossible}} to <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> garage bands were active in the 1960s, their numbers were extensive. [...] According to Mark Nobles, it is estimated that over 180,000 bands formed in the United States during the period, amongst which several thousand made records. [...] Garage bands performed in a variety of venues. [...] Less-established groups typically played at parties, school dances, and teen clubs. [...] For acts of legal age (and in some cases younger), bars, nightclubs, and college fraternity socials also provided regular engagements. [...] Occasionally, local groups had the opportunity to open at shows for famous touring acts. [...] Some garage rock bands went on tour, particularly better-known acts, but also lesser-known groups that received bookings or airplay beyond their immediate locale. [...] Groups often competed in [...] "battles of the bands", which gave musicians an opportunity to gain exposure and a chance to win a prize, such as free equipment or recording time in a local studio. [...] Contests were held, locally, regionally and nationally, and three of the most prestigious national events were held annually by the Tea Council of the U.S.A., the Music Circus, and the United States Junior Chamber.|$|E
