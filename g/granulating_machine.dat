40|$|DE 1004020898 A UPAB: 20051222 NOVELTY - Blades(9) {{attached}} to a holder(3) make a rotating or oscillating movement relative to a perforated plate(1) and are pressed against the plate with a prescribed pressure. A pressure sensor(11) on each blade(9) is connected to a control unit which sets the required pressure and/or adjusts the blade position relative to the perforated plate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Each sensor(11) comprises a piezo resistive component, preferably a thin diamond-like carbon layer with piezo resistive properties. Sensors are arranged at the connection between each blade(9) and blade holder(3). preferably mounted directly on a component, a blade or blade holder. Several sensors can be arranged along the blade length. Strain gauges may act as additional sensors on the blades or additional piezo actuators(12) may be incorporated between blade and blade holder. Blades can be adjusted on the holder. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for measuring and adjusting blade pressure against a perforated plate with a wear resistant coating in which: a) the forces between each blade and perforated plate are measured by a piezo resistive type pressure sensor; b) the results are sent to a control unit for comparison with both a set minimum pressure of the blade holder and also a value for the maximum permissible pressure applied onto the plate coating; c) the applied pressure of the blade holder can be varied up or down if required depending on the comparison. USE - For measuring and adjusting force between blades and perforated plate on a plastics <b>granulating</b> <b>machine.</b> ADVANTAGE - Individual blade pressures can be measured directly to prevent overloading blades, perforated plate and plate coating and the intervals between blade changing are increased...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{dealt with}} the {{evaluation}} of mechanical properties of the cylinder wheat straw, rapeseed straw and 50 / 50 % mixed wheat and rapeseed straw pellet samples. The pellets {{were made by the}} <b>granulating</b> <b>machine</b> MGL 200 (Kovonovak). The compressive loading curves of dependencies of stress on strain were realised by the test stand Andilog Stentor 1000 (Andilog Technologies, Vitrolles, France). Certain mechanical parameters were determined, namely the initial force (force at 10 % of compress strain), force in maximum of loading curve, strain in maximum of loading curve, initial stress (stress at 10 % of compression strain), stress in maximum of loading curve and modulus of elasticity. Mean value of the initial force was maximal for mixed straw pellet samples 52. 49 N. Mean values of the initial force of the wheat straw samples and the rapeseed straw samples were smaller and almost identical 43. 58 N and 43. 12 N. Mean values of the initial stress of loading curve, of the wheat straw samples reached 1. 46 MPa, the rapeseed straw samples reached value 1. 40 MPa and the mixed straw samples reached value 1. 63 MPa. Mean value of the force in maximum of loading curve was also maximal for mixed straw pellet samples 213. 26 N. Mean values of the force in maximum of loading curve of the wheat straw samples reached 178. 11 N. The rapeseed straw samples reached value 95. 95 N and the mixed straw samples reached value 213. 26 N. Mean values of the stress in maximum of loading curve, of the wheat straw samples reached 5. 93 MPa, the rapeseed straw samples reached value 3. 11 MPa and the mixed straw samples reached value 7. 10 MPa Mean values of the modulus of elasticity, of the wheat straw samples reached 18. 27 MPa, the rapeseed straw samples reached value 13. 08 MPa and the mixed straw samples reached value 14. 97 MPa. Significant correlations of the mechanical parameters pellet samples were observed among initial force and initial stress and modulus of elasticity. Significant correlations of force in maximum with stress and strain in the maximum were observed...|$|E

40|$|Challenges facing {{pharmaceutical}} efforts {{aimed at}} utilization of medicinal plants as formulated dosage forms are: formulation of an effective, safe, elegant and stable dosage form {{to be used}} by an appropriate route of administration at a suitable dose and frequency of administration to give the required therapeutic activity for the proper period of time, without or with minimal side or toxic effects. A questionnaire was used to investigate the practice of house-hold usage of medicinal herbs, and the data collected indicated that the herb most commonly used as an antispasmodic remedy was Solenostemma argel(48 %) among another four medicinal plants. Botanical and phytochemical experiments were carried out for the identification and classification of the herb as well as extraction, separation and identification of the main constituents of S. argelleaves. They included general identity tests of S. argel leaves, e. g. the macroscopical, microscopical, macro-chemical analysis, thin layer chromatography and column analysis for the presence of characteristic alkaloids and flavonoids. Detection, separation, and isolation of flavonoids involved the use of silica gel columns eluted with different solvent systems. Alkaloids were extracted from S. argelhomogenised leaves in a soxlet with different solvent systems. The identification tests confirmed the presence of both alkaloids and flavonoids in these extracts. Phytochemical experiments also included detection, separation and identification of flavonoid compounds in water or methanol extracts of S. argelby using paper chromatography or thin layer chromatography, silica gel, run in B:A:W system. The chromatograms were sprayed with natural substances reagent or ninhydrin. Separation of different flavonoid compounds was carried out by using an accelerated eluted solvent passage through a polyamide chromatographic column using different solvent systems, and these portions were examined for their pharmacological effects. Microbiological quality control of Solenostemma argelleaves powders and preparations showed that these products were negative for Escherichia coliand Salmonella spp., and their levels of contamination did not exceed 200 cfu/g. Pharmacological and toxicological experiments were conducted for verification and confirmation of the biological activities of the powder, extracts, and alkaloids of S. argel on different experimental models, and authentication of the effectiveness of S. argel preparations. They included using different experimental animal models, and this was followed by other experiments for further investigation of the possible toxic effects of S. argelpreparations, in different dosage regimens, to ascertain the safety of these S. argelproducts. Solenostemma argelextract showed inhibitory effects upon the spontaneous as well as induced contractions produced by acetylcholine (1 µg/ml) or barium chloride (0. 002 mg/ml) in contracting rabbit small intestine model or guinea pig small intestine model, and the degrees of relaxation were compared with those produced by reference drugs such as hyoscine or papaverine. Other experimental models including isolated rabbit heart and intact African toad heart showed the depressant effects on the myocardium of different S. argelextracts, perfused continuously, and reduction of the heart rate and stroke. The local anaesthetic effects of S. argelextracts were studied on African toad’s foot withdrawal reflex and compared with those of lignocaine, kaempferol, quercetin and rutin. The relative potency of S. argelalkaloids was 50 % of that of lignocaine and equivalent to that of kaempferol. Solenostemma argelalkaloids diffusion across rabbit small intestine was studied before and after the addition of 0. 01 g of sodium fluoride. This revealed the inhibitory effects (70 - 90 %) of sodium fluoride on S. argelalkaloids diffusion rate across the rabbit small intestine, and indicated involvement of an active transport mechanism. X Median effective doses (ED 50) of S. argelalkaloids (0. 275 mg) and hyoscine (0. 035 mg) were calculated by the MedUSA system used to compare their antispasmodic effects by recording the inhibitory effects of these two drugs on acetylcholine-induced contraction of guinea pig ileum model. The activity of hyoscine was eight times that of S. argelalkaloids. Toxicological investigations included evaluation of acute toxicity of S. argelby determination of lethal doses of S. argel in four Albino Canadian rats and four local species rabbits. The mean lethal dose was 6. 35 g/kg for the rabbits and 5. 49 g/kg for the rats (n= 4)). The median lethal dose, (LD 50), of S. argelalkaloids was determined in sixty Albino rats assigned to six groups of ten animals each. Starting from the lethal dose of 5. 49 g/kg, each group was given a different intra-peritoneal injection of: 25 %, 37. 5 %, 50 %, 75 %, 87. 5 %, or 100 % of the lethal dose, and the log dose was plotted versus the mean deaths; the LD 50 obtained from the graph was 5. 0 g/kg in Albino rats. Evaluation of acute toxicity of S. argelwas carried out in a group of seven young Nubian goats and compared with the control group. Individual animals in the test group were given a 5 g/kg dose of S. argelsyrup once daily for 45 days, and the animals were sacrificed and investigations carried out revealed: no significant (P< 0. 05) changes in the weight of the vital organs; but their histopathological examination revealed some tissue abnormalities including: congested heart; hyperaemia of the intestinal tissues and catarrhal inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration; liver tissue necrosis of centrilobular hepatocytes and fatty cytoplasm vacuolation; kidney tissue necrosis of renal tubules and interstitial mononuclear cells infiltration. There were changes in serum concentrations of urea, inorganic phosphorus, creatinine, calcium, total protein and albumin; alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase had high levels. RBCs count, MCV and PCV were higher in treated animals compared to normal goats. Similar studies of toxic effects of S. argelalkaloids were conducted in white Albino Canadian rats, without significant changes occurring in their vital organs, but there were significant increases in urea, creatinine, calcium, phosphorous, alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase. Phosphorus, creatinine, calcium, total protein, albumin concentrations, as well as alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase activities were at high levels in animals given high dose of 0. 63 gm/kg of S. argel alkaloids. Changes in haematological parameters included decreases in haemoglobin and packed cell volume with the maximum dose of 640 mg/kg and the effective dose of 160 mg/kg, while there was an increase with the median effective dose of 320 mg/kg. Solenostemma argelleaves preparations were designed and formulated in tablets as an oral dosage form similar to its oral use in folkloric medicine. Tablets were selected as a dosage form because of their several advantages including: improved dosage accuracy and reliable delivery of the drug; ease of their preparation, evaluation, control, storage, and dispensing; convenience of use and compliance of patients; their inherently higher chemical stability and their rapid mass production, and are the least expensive of the solid dosage forms. Pharmaceutical experiments included optimization of physicochemical characters of S. argeltablets prepared from the powdered leaves, extracts or alkaloids {{in a wide range of}} pharmaceutical formulations with different types and concentrations of diluents, binders and disintegrants, in addition to optimization of drug particle size and process conditions, such as the state and time of binder or disintegrant additions. The optimized formulations were subjected to a wide range of quality control tests including physical and chemical parameters, particularly hardness, friability, disintegration and dissolution, and hence affecting drug release, bioavailability, absorption and therapeutic activity. Solenostemma argelleaves were powdered using a hammer mill to a particle size and distribution that would flow freely. Sieve analysis and separation of S. argelleaves powder, applicable to particles in the size range of ≤ 160 to ≥ 250 microns, was used XI both as a method of particle size analysis and separation of powder into various sizes ranges, in order to produce materials within a specified range, and screen out very fine particles or over-size materials. The amount of powder that passed through the 160 -micron mesh was found to be 63 %, and this fraction of powdered S. argel leaves was mainly used in the formulation of optimized S. argeltablets. Preparation of the granules of different formulae involved preparation and use of various binders. The wet masses of different formulations were forced through a No. 12 -mesh screen manually in the case of small batches, or by using Erweka <b>granulating</b> <b>machine</b> with large batches. The prepared granules were dried in a hot air oven at 50 °C overnight, and the dried granules were sized by passing through a No. 14 -mesh screen, to facilitate the granules flow and compressibility. Following granules sizing, the granules were mixed with the other formulation ingredients, such disintegrants, lubricants and glidants, and compressed into tablets using a single-punch tableting machine. Different formulae of S. argel tablets were prepared by compressing unit volumes equivalent to 500 mg of the granulation or leaves powders and 250 mg of the granulation in the case of the dried extracts or alkaloids of S. argel. From these optimization trials, it was concluded that: a) a combination of binding agents was needed and a reduction of binder concentration was a must to optimize these formulae; and b) the use of a disintegrating agent, before and after granulation, in S. argelleaves tablets also optimized these formulae. Stability experiments were included investigation and determination of the possible effects of different storage conditions, including on-going stability conditions and accelerated stability conditions, on the physicochemical properties of optimized S. argel tablets. In quality assurance studies, stability is defined as the extent to which a product retains, within specified limits, and through its period of storage and use, i. e. its shelflife, the same properties and characteristics that it possessed at the time of its manufacture. Accelerated stability testing are studies designed to increase the rate of chemical degradation and physical change of drug by using exaggerated storage conditions; they should be used consistentlythroughout a particular stability study. These stability tests were carried out by placing 100 tablets of each formula at room temperature at 30 o C± 15 o C and RH 60 %± 15 %; in an incubator at 37 o C± 2 o C and RH 70 %± 5 %; and in another incubator at 50 °C± 5 °C and RH 70 %± 5 %, for intervals extending from 6 months to 48 months. Evaluation of the physicochemical properties was done at zero time, and at the specified time intervals. The results were tabulated for each formula. Physicochemical characters and properties changes evaluated included: uniformity of weight, diameter, thickness, microbial growth, tablet hardness, friability, disintegration time, dissolution rate of tablet constituents, powder contents estimation with time, and mottling, capping, and lamination. In certain formulae of the tested tablets, there were changes in the hardness, odour, friability and powder contents. Questionnaire (II) was used to evaluate the practice of using herbal medicines as antispasmodic remedy, and revealed the effectiveness of the medicinal herbs used, with 60 % of the participants feeling completely relieved of pain after a single administration of the medicinal herb, and 26 % used the drug several times due to repeated attacks of pain. With regard to the types of herbal preparations used, 45 % used decoctions, 38 % used powder type, and 17 % used macerated plants preparations. Clinical investigations included evaluation of safety and efficacy of Solenostemma argel tablets, and determination of any possible side effects, adverse reactions or toxic manifestations at therapeutic dosage regimen in ten healthy male volunteers. This was followed by evaluation of therapeutic effectiveness and side effects of S. argeltablets in a group of hundred patients with different clinical complains mainly gastro-intestinal tract colics, or urinogenital tract spasms and menstrual pain. None of these subjects, healthy or patient, complained of any serious side effects or toxic reactions. XII Ten healthy male subjects participated in these clinical trials after signing a written consent, and were subjected to a medical examination and follow up by a clinician. The trials were started with low doses, e. g. one tablet three times daily, and gradually increased till the highest dose of four tablets three times a day for each of the leaves, extracts or alkaloids tablets was attained. The volunteers were monitored for the occurrence of any side effects or adverse reactions. None of the volunteers complained of blurred vision, dryness of the mouth, tachycardia or bradycardia, palpitation, headache or vomiting during the period of the trial. Only one of these subjects complained of dryness of the mouth and another subject complained of stomach upset felt at the time of administration ofSolenostemma argelleaves tablets. The clinical trials were organized in three teaching hospitals under the supervision of four clinicians. Randomly selected 100 patients, 20 - 70 years old and 40 males and 60 females, were complaining of abdominal disturbances, and diagnosed as having gastritis, indigestion, heartburn, flatulence, irritable bowel syndrome, renal colics, or colics due to menstrual pain. These patients were treated by using two tablets of Solenostemma argelleaves or extracts administered when necessary. They were followed up for therapeutic effectiveness of the administered tablets as indicated by the relief of pain and colics, and monitored for occurrence of side effects or adverse reactions. When necessary, another two-tablet dose was administered to patients when there was recurrence of pain or colics. The general observation in treatment of gastrointestinal disturbances with Solenostemma argeltablets was the quick suppression of symptoms and relief of pain occurring immediately following drug administration. However, in the case of renal colics, pain associated with menstrual disturbances, and irritable bowel syndrome, IBS, there might be a need for repetition of the treatment. In most cases, the pain was relieved without any pronounced side effects or adverse reactions. Different types of Solenostemma argeltablets showed a very good therapeutic effectiveness (71 %- 100 %), and a great margin of safety (98 %- 100 %). Forty patients with diagnosed irritable bowel syndrome were treated with placebo tablets (5 % pain relief), generic antispasmodic tablets (90 %), and Solenostemma argel leaves (71 %) or extract (88 %) tablets. Solenostemma argelextract tablets had a quicker onset of action and were more effective than the equivalent leaves tablets. No side effects were recorded with extract tablets, but in two patients mild stomach upset was recorded with leaves tablets. Accordingly, Solenostemma argeltablets, especially those of the extract or alkaloid, would be useful in relieving IBS associated pain by administering two tablets half an hour before meals. Success of the present project and implementation of its findings may pave the way for other projects to be designed and conducted for further utilization of other useful medicinal plants used in folkloric practices...|$|E
