The first of these highly accurate experiments was conducted by Brillet & Hall (1979), in which they analyzed a laser frequency stabilized to a resonance of a rotating optical <b>Fabry–Pérot</b> <b>cavity.</b> They set a limit on the anisotropy of the speed of light resulting from the Earth's motions of Δc/c≈10−15, where Δc is the difference between the speed of light in the x- and y-directions.|$|E
25|$|An optical {{frequency}} comb {{can be generated}} by modulating the amplitude and/or phase of a continuous-wave laser with an external modulator driven by a radio-frequency source. In this manner, the frequency comb is centered around the {{optical frequency}} provided by the continuous-wave laser and the modulation frequency or repetition rate is given by the external radio-frequency source. The advantage of this method {{is that it can}} reach much higher repetition rates (>10GHz) than with mode-locked lasers and the two degrees of freedom of the comb can be set independently. The number of lines is lower than with a mode-locked laser (typically a few tens), but the bandwidth can be significantly broadened with nonlinear fibers. This type of optical frequency comb is usually called electrooptic frequency comb. The first schemes used a phase modulator inside an integrated <b>Fabry–Perot</b> <b>cavity,</b> but with advances in electro-optic modulators new arrangements are possible.|$|E

While simple, this arrangement is rarely used in large-scale lasers due to the difficulty of alignment; the mirrors must be aligned parallel within a few seconds of arc, or [...] "walkoff" [...] of the intracavity beam will result in it spilling out of the sides of the cavity. However, this problem is much reduced for very short cavities with a small mirror separation distance (L < 1nbsp&cm). Plane-parallel resonators are therefore commonly used in microchip and microcavity lasers and semiconductor lasers. In these cases, rather than using separate mirrors, a reflective optical coating may be directly applied to the laser medium itself.

It is shown that the frequency of the oscillations is equal to the accumulated Doppler shift and the relaxation time of the oscillations is equal to the storage time of the cavity. Comparison of the predicted and the measured Doppler shift is discussed, and application of the analytical solution for measurement of the mirror velocity is described. <b>Fabry-Perot</b> <b>cavities</b> with the length of several kilometers are utilized in laser gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO [1].

While the <b>Fabry-Perot</b> <b>cavity</b> of a Balle-Flygare FTMW spectrometer can typically be tuned into resonance at any frequency between 6 and 18 GHz, the bandwidth of individual measurements is restricted to about 1 MHz.

Unfortunately, no commercially available device is capable of producing the desired arbitrary combinations of amplitude and phase modulation.
