40|$|Contractual {{obligations}} {{are traditionally}} regarded as voluntary. A voluntary obligation {{is one that}} can be acquired only if one intends to acquire it. This traditional understanding finds doctrinal expression in the requirement that contracting parties intend to create legal relations. It has, however, been doubted that the Anglo-Canadian law of contract insists on this requirement. Skeptics argue that cases ostensibly decided on the basis of such a requirement are better explained otherwise. In this paper I invoke the legal force of contractual disclaimers to show that contractual obligations are indeed voluntary. When parties to an agreement purport to exclude it from the reach of the law by expressly disavowing an intention to bind themselves legally, they have issued a disclaimer. An unambiguous disclaimer will preclude an agreement from being enforced as a contract. Contractual obligations are thus “disclaimer-sensitive”. I argue that this striking feature of contractual obligations can be plausibly explained only <b>if</b> <b>contractual</b> obligations are voluntary...|$|E
40|$|In {{legal systems}} with {{expensive}} or ineffective contract enforcement, {{it is difficult}} to induce lenders to enforce debt contracts. If lenders do not enforce, borrowers will have incentives to misbehave. Lenders have incentives to enforce given bad news when debt is short-term and subject to runs caused by externalities across lenders. Lenders will not undo these externalities by negotiation. The required number of lenders increases with enforcement costs. A very high enforcement cost can exceed the ex ante incentive benefit of enforcement. Removing lenders ’ right to immediately enforce their debt with a “bail-in ” can improve the ex ante incentives of borrowers. HOW SHOULD BORROWERS AND LENDERS structure financial contracts when contract enforcement is ineffective and costly? <b>If</b> <b>contractual</b> remedies do not benefit lenders, then they may not enforce their contracts.

(b) questions about decentralization in government are questions about the allocation of control rights. <b>If</b> <b>contractual</b> relation were complete, it would not matter whether power were decentralized, as contracts would specify everything to be done at each level of government. There would be no need for discretion; (c) how much to decentralize depends on which level of government will have the most incentive to bring about desired outcomes. Centralized governments may be better at coordinating things but tend to be less accountable than decentralized governments (with important expections); and (d) the organizational design of government affects not only incentives to make decisions but also incentives to gather the information on which those decisions are based.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a small set of new rules for banking and {{financial}} markets designed to address systemic risk. Regulatory capital requirements should not be calibrated to the risks an individual bank is taking, since risk measurement itself is biased. Capital requirements should be substantially increased, at least as a backup of wholesale liabilities in contrast to depositary debt; higher capital requirements will lower the risk premium banks must pay to investors, the cost of capital will go down; a credit crunch, therefore, is not to be expected. Derivatives trading and reselling of securitized risky assets add a high degree of complexity and unpredictability to the system. It proved illusionary that well informed counterparties might be able to reasonably assess the risks of complex securities. We propose to reintroduce negative legal enforcement, which has been effective at least partly until 2002 in Germany; <b>if</b> <b>contractual</b> obligations from complex derivatives are no more be legally enforceable the market of these instruments would dry up.

40|$|Since the Argentine {{debt crisis}} in 2001 (and the {{settlement}} of 2005) the influence and credibility of the official sector especially the IMF is at a historical low.

In the absence of a global, multilateral, regulatory framework for sovereign debt restructuring, our examination of changes in the period leading up to the Argentine settlement and after, reveals that market participants may instead be relying on good faith to do the job with the court recognising similar expectations. Good faith, though entrenched as a legal norm in several domestic jurisdictions, such as Germany and the U. S., is a relative newcomer to sovereign debt workouts. This evolving norm is not institutionally embedded and unlike the domestically entrenched version, is not a legal rule with specific requirements that needs to be fulfilled. W...|$|E

His project is to use what all contractual exchanges have in common to better understand contracts enforceable by a legal system. By so doing he has shown that such legally enforceable contracts themselves exist on a continuum that ranges from fully specified contracts in which all obligations are unambiguously expressed at the time of formation, which he calls 2 ̆ 2 discrete 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 presentiated 2 ̆ 2 contracts, to contracts that govern relationships that exist and evolve over long periods of time, which he terms 2 ̆ 2 intertwined 2 ̆ 2 contracts...|$|E

40|$|Freedom of {{contract}} {{is one of}} the fundamental principles of private law. Most pronounced is the principle {{of contract}}ual freedom in business contractual relationships, in which is admitted the highest degree of contractual freedom. Contractual freedom is often generally associated with the rule that what is not forbidden is allowed, ie. if the legal regulation does not prohibit any contractual arrangement, is such an arrangement allowed. This understanding of freedom of contract is very simplistic and misleading and thus in many cases incorrect. Given that freedom of contract is seen as a rule or principle, approach to it is fairly spontaneously and in search of answers to the question of legality or illegality of certain contractual arrangements, the progress is often intuitively and based on ad hoc reasoning the contractual freedom is in individual cases either accepted or rejected. One reason for this approach is the fact that there have been no more precise rules for a differentiation of non- mandatory and mandatory legal rules.

40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{property}} rights and monitoring cost explanation for the allocation of residual income and decision rights between the carriers and truck drivers under internal governance. First, by applying the property rights theory, we argue that the structure of residual income rights depends {{on the importance of}} noncontractible (intangible) assets of the truck driver to generate residual surplus. The more important the truck driver's intangible knowledge assets, the more residual income rights should be transferred to him. Second, we controlled for the monitoring costs as an additional explanatory variable of the allocation of residual income rights. According to agency theory, the variable proportion of the driver's income should be higher where monitoring costs are higher. Third, we investigate the relationship between residual income and residual decision rights under internal governance. <b>If</b> the <b>contractual</b> relation is governed by an employment contract, residual decision and residual income rights may be substitutes because, under fiat, a certain incentive effect of the governance structure may result either from the allocation of high-powered incentives or the transfer of residual decision rights to the driver.

40|$|Spanning {{nearly forty}} years, the Supreme Court has issued {{multiple}} decisions and stated categorically that “judicial hostility to arbitration” {{was the sole}} impetus behind Congress’s decision to enact the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925. In fact, before the FAA, systemic trade-specific problems and practices generated heated disputes and widespread litigation among merchants and trade organizations. Thus, to arrest those constituents’ concerns, Congress enacted the FAA. Briefly, under the FAA section 2, arbitration is mandatory <b>if</b> a <b>contractual</b> arbitration provision is valid and a controversy “arises out of the contract. ” However, common-law rules of contract formation are equally clear: Standing alone, standardized-preprinted application forms are not valid contracts; thus, they not enforceable.

Put simply, the consequences of such practices are severe: Before contracts are formed, applicants for goods, services and employment—ordinary consumers and workers as well as small-business owners, start-up entrepreneurs and prospective franchisees—are forced to relinquish their rights to litigate common-law and statutory claims {{in state and federal}} courts.
