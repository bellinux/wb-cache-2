5|$|After {{the judges}} {{returned}} home, Lawrence {{was made a}} Baron for his work at Nuremberg, but Birkett received nothing. The lack of reward for his work pushed him into depression, which he took many months to recover from. He was eventually made a Privy Counsellor in the 1947 Birthday Honours list, but he saw this as poor reward for the work he <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> at Nuremberg.|$|E
5|$|Maximian's campaigns {{were not}} {{proceeding}} as smoothly. The Bagaudae had been easily suppressed, but Carausius, {{the man he}} <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> charge of operations against Saxon and Frankish pirates on the Saxon Shore, had, according to literary sources, begun keeping the goods seized from the pirates for himself. Maximian issued a death-warrant for his larcenous subordinate. Carausius fled the Continent, proclaimed himself Augustus, and agitated Britain and northwestern Gaul into open revolt against Maximian and Diocletian.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Joe McEwen of Sire Records {{began to}} pursue the band. McEwen, who brought notable acts such as Dinosaur Jr and Shawn Colvin to Sire, had been {{interested}} in them since hearing the Not Forever, Just for Now demo tape. At the urging of Gary Louris, McEwen offered Uncle Tupelo a contract. Band manager Tony Margherita invoked the $50,000 escape clause he <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> their Rockville contract, freeing the band to sign a seven-year deal with Sire. The deal required two albums, and specified a budget of $150,000 for their first.|$|E

5|$|Members of Task Force Manchu {{who escaped}} from Hill 209 brought back {{considerable}} intelligence information of North Korean {{activity in the}} vicinity of the Paekchin ferry crossing site. At the ferry site the North Koreans <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> an underwater bridge. A short distance downstream, each night they placed a pontoon bridge across the river and took it up before dawn the next morning. Carrying parties of 50 civilians guarded by four North Korean soldiers crossed the river continuously at night, an estimated total of 800-1,000 carriers being used at this crossing site.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{started the}} 1964–65 season on wages of £40 a week, {{and the club}} only agreed to pay £60 a week in December. These miserly wages made it {{difficult}} for the club to spend the £80,000 it received from the sale of Frank McLintock – he <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> a transfer request over dissatisfaction with his pay and quality replacements were reluctant to join a club that paid full internationals like Banks and McLintock no more than the base rate that rival clubs paid to average players. Leicester finished 18th in the league and were knocked out of the FA Cup by Liverpool at Anfield in the sixth round. In the League Cup, City struggled to get past Peterborough United (in a replay), Grimsby Town and Crystal Palace (in a replay), before they recorded an 8–1 victory over Coventry City at Highfield Road. After easing past Plymouth Argyle in the semi-finals, Banks found himself playing in another League Cup final. However Chelsea won the final after successfully defending their 3–2 win at Stamford Bridge with a goalless draw at Filbert Street.|$|E
5|$|Bruce also greatly {{strengthened}} {{the research and}} information-gathering capacity of the executive, and sought to make decisions and policy {{on the basis of}} the best available evidence and information. A record 22 Royal Commissions reported to the Bruce government, as well as scores of other inquiries and research projects undertaken by the Commonwealth in a wide range of areas, particularly on economic, industrial and agricultural matters. Recognising that investment in science was essential to expanding the opportunities for agricultural and economic development in Australia, Bruce established the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), now known as the CSIRO. He established the Bureau of Economic Research in 1929 and for the first time economists were regularly employed to advise the government on what had been until then exclusively political issues. By the time he left office, he <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> place extensive structures to provide information to the prime minister and the executive branch on most major areas of policy, a major development in the professional capacity of the Australian prime minister.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} to Britain in 1821, MacGregor claimed that King George Frederic Augustus of the Mosquito Coast in the Gulf of Honduras had created him Cazique of Poyais, which he {{described}} as a developed colony with an existing community of British settlers. When the British press reported on MacGregor's deception following the return of fewer than 50 survivors in late 1823, some of his victims leaped to his defence, insisting that the general had been let down by those whom he <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> charge of the emigration party. A French court tried MacGregor and three others for fraud in 1826 after he attempted {{a variation on the}} scheme there, but convicted only one of his associates. Acquitted, MacGregor attempted lesser Poyais schemes in London over the next decade. In 1838, he moved to Venezuela, where he was welcomed back as a hero. He died in Caracas in 1845, aged 58, and was buried with full military honours in Caracas Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{escalated}} between foreign traders on Samoa and {{the local}} populace, {{due in part to}} controls which Tilley <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> place to protect Samoan farmers from exploitation. Dr. David Starr Jordan, a prominent American biologist doing research in the territory, was so concerned by these tensions that he sent a letter to President Theodore Roosevelt asking that a trader not be made governor of the territory, if a civil administration were created. Shortly after, many traders and locals, including a Samoan tax collector, circulated a petition requesting a change in the way the copra crop was taxed and asking for the Navy to cease governing the territory. The petition was sent to members of Congress and the cause was picked up by California representative Julius Kahn and gathered significant press coverage. This movement eventually reached President Roosevelt; his decision was not to act on the petition.|$|E

25|$|Before film {{director}} James Mangold {{signed on to}} Knight and Day, it was previously associated with director Tom Dey.
