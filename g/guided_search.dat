We address an approach that uses a Bayesian network model to adaptively <b>guide</b> <b>search</b> in this space. We examine <b>guiding</b> <b>search</b> towards areas that previously performed well and towards areas that ILP has not yet thoroughly explored. We show improvement in area under the curve for recall-precision curves using these modifications. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Guided</b> Local <b>Search</b> is {{a general}} penalty-based {{optimisation}} method that sits on top of local search methods to help them escape local optimum. It {{has been applied to}} a variety of problems and demonstrated effective. The aim of this paper is not to produce further evidence that <b>Guided</b> Local <b>Search</b> is an effective algorithm, but to present an extension of <b>Guided</b> Local <b>Search</b> that potentially has no parameter to tune. Compared to other algorithms, <b>Guided</b> Local <b>Search</b> is relatively easy to apply, as there is only one major parameter (#) to set. In some applications, performance of <b>Guided</b> Local <b>Search</b> is insensitive to the value of this parameter. Nevertheless, the value of this parameter can affect the performance of <b>Guided</b> Local <b>Search</b> in some problems. In this paper, we show how (a) an aspiration criterion and (b) random moves may be added to <b>Guided</b> Local <b>Search</b> to reduce the sensitivity of its performance to the parameter value. The extended <b>Guided</b> Local <b>Search</b> is tested on the SAT, weighted MAX-SAT and Quadratic Assignment Problems with positive results...|$|R

5000|$|As a {{reaction}} to the feature integration theory, Wolfe (1994) proposed the <b>Guided</b> <b>Search</b> Model 2.0. According to this model, attention is directed to an object or location through a preattentive process. The preattentive process, as Wolfe explains, directs attention in both a bottom-up and top-down way. Information acquired through both bottom-up and top-down processing is ranked according to priority. The priority ranking guides visual search and makes the search more efficient. Whether the <b>Guided</b> <b>Search</b> Model 2.0 or the feature integration theory are [...] "correct" [...] theories of visual search is still a hotly debated topic.|$|E
5000|$|A second main {{function}} of preattentive processes is to direct focal {{attention to the}} most [...] "promising" [...] information in the visual field. There are two ways in which these processes {{can be used to}} direct attention: bottom-up activation (which is stimulus-driven) and top-down activation (which is user-driven). In the <b>guided</b> <b>search</b> model by Jeremy Wolfe, information from top-down and bottom-up processing of the stimulus is used to create a ranking of items in order of their attentional priority. In a visual search, attention will be directed to the item with the highest priority. If that item is rejected, then attention will {{move on to the next}} item and the next, and so forth. The <b>guided</b> <b>search</b> theory follows that of parallel search processing.|$|E
50|$|An {{activation}} map is {{a representation}} of visual space in which the level of activation at a location reflects {{the likelihood that the}} location contains a target. This likelihood is based on preattentive, featural information of the perceiver. According to the <b>guided</b> <b>search</b> model, the initial processing of basic features produces an activation map, with every item in the visual display having its own level of activation. Attention is demanded based on peaks of activation in the activation map in a search for the target. Visual search can proceed efficiently or inefficiently. During efficient search, performance is unaffected by the number of distractor items. The reaction time functions are flat, and the search is assumed to be a parallel search. Thus, in the <b>guided</b> <b>search</b> model, a search is efficient if the target generates the highest, or one of the highest activation peaks. For example, suppose someone is searching for red, horizontal targets. Feature processing would activate all red objects and all horizontal objects. Attention is then directed to items depending on their level of activation, starting with those most activated. This explains why search times are longer when distractors share one or more features with the target stimuli. In contrast, during inefficient search, the reaction time to identify the target increases linearly with the number of distractor items present. According to the <b>guided</b> <b>search</b> model, this is because the peak generated by the target {{is not one of the}} highest.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a variety of}} ways to detect relatively isolated, highly restricted subproblems and then exploit them to <b>guide</b> <b>search</b> for a solution. It introduces a local search method that, prior to search, estimates where such subproblems lie within constraint satisfaction problems. These subproblems are assembled into a secondary structure used with dynamic variable-ordering heuristics to <b>guide</b> <b>search,</b> while learning protects against the occasional inadequacies of local search. On some classes of difficult structured benchmark problems, this approach solves constraint satisfaction problems an order of magnitude faster. ...|$|R

50|$|Another {{explanation}} for the eccentricity effect {{is that of the}} <b>guided</b> <b>search</b> model. This model posits that when an individual is carrying out a visual search task, their attention is deployed to one item at a time. The order of this attention depends on the activation of the item - the item receives more activation if it shares similar features with the target. In the case of eccentricity, the item/s that is/are closest to the target i.e. less eccentric, will receive more activation; and items further away i.e. those that have greater eccentricity, will receive less activation, and therefore processing for these will be slower and less accurate.|$|E

5000|$|For {{a decade}} Washington {{prospector}} Wilbur Armstrong <b>guided</b> <b>search</b> parties into the Pitt Lake area {{to find the}} legendary treasure located [...] "within 20 miles {{of the head of}} Pitt Lake.” When interviewed in 1915 Armstrong mentioned that in 1901 a white man called Walter Jackson found the mine. As in the other stories Jackson fell gravely ill after discovering the gold and before he died he wrote a letter to a friend describing his find's location and this description of the treasures: [...] "I found a place where the bedrock is bare, and you will hardly believe me when I tell you the bedrock was yellow with gold. In a few days I gathered thousands, and there was thousands more in sight. Some of the nuggets were as big as walnuts....I saw there were millions practically at the surface. I buried part of the gold under a tent-shaped rock with a mark cut on the face.” The story of a white man discovering the gold of Pitt Lake initially only appeared in newspapers in the United States. Ten years later an article appeared in the Vancouver Province [...] reporting that for 24 years dozens of prospectors had been looking in vain for “untold wealth” in placer gold somewhere back of Pitt Lake. They were also looking for a treasure of placer gold buried under a rock by a prospector called Shotwell—the man named Walter Jackson in Armstrong's story. Shotwell came out of the Pitt Lake area in the fall of 1901 and went to San Francisco where, according to the records at the United States mint, he deposited more than $8,000 in placer gold. Following the familiar pattern Shotwell fell ill and his physician told him that he had not long to live. Before the prospector died he sent a letter to an unnamed partner from his Alaska days, letting him know that he had found “fabulous rich placer ground in the mountains back of Pitt Lake.” Shotwell said, he had buried a sack of gold “under a tent-shaped rock, in a valley overlooked by three mountain peaks standing close together.” The letter gave directions to where the “golden cache” was buried and the grounds that Shotwell had worked.In an interview in 1939, Hugh Murray of New Westminster retold the story about a white prospector, his rich placer gold findings and the cache of gold under a tent-shaped rock. In Murray’s account the man was called John Jackson, a veteran Alaskan prospector, who in 1903, hearing about the Slumach legend set out for the Pitt Lake area and returned three months later with a very heavy pack-sack. Jackson deposited $8,700 in gold in the Bank of British North America in San Francisco—an affiliate of a Canadian bank. Before he died, Jackson, suffering from the hardships of the search, sent a letter and a map with the information about the location of the treasure to a friend in Seattle called Shotwell. Being an old man, Shotwell himself was unable to search for the gold, and he sold a share to a fellow Seattle man who went to the Pitt Lake region looking for Jackson’s creek “but returned without success when the map became partially damaged.” The damaged map can’t have been of much use and Jackson’s letter was not much of a help either. But Murray, among others, kept believing and searching. His belief was strengthened after meeting “… an old Indian woman at the Indian camp at the head of Pitt Lake who remembered Jackson staying with them in 1903…” with his very heavy pack that he would not let out of sight.Nowhere but in these stories is there any evidence that Jackson or Shotwell ever existed.|$|E
40|$|Computational {{resources}} are increasing rapidly with {{the explosion of}} multi-core processors readily available from major vendors. Model checking needs to harness these resources to help make it more effective in practical verification. Directed model checking uses heuristics in a <b>guided</b> <b>search</b> to rank states in order of interest. Randomizing <b>guided</b> <b>search</b> {{makes it possible to}} harness computation nodes by running independent searches in parallel in a effort to discover counter-examples to correctness. Initial attempts at adding randomization to <b>guided</b> <b>search</b> have achieved very limited success. In this work, we present a new lowcost randomized <b>guided</b> <b>search</b> technique that shuffles states in the priority queue with equivalent heuristic ties. We show in an empirical study that randomized <b>guided</b> <b>search,</b> overall, decreases the number of states generated before error discovery when compared to a <b>guided</b> <b>search</b> using the same heuristic. To further evaluate the performance gains of randomized <b>guided</b> <b>search</b> using a particular heuristic, we compare it with randomized depth-first search. Randomized depth-first search shuffles transitions and generally improves error discovery over the default transition order implemented by the model checker. In the context of evaluating randomized <b>guided</b> <b>search,</b> a randomized depth-first search provides a lower bound for establishing performance gains in directed model checking.

40|$|Current {{models of}} human visual search have {{extended}} the traditional serial/parallel search dichotomy. Two successful models for predicting human visual search are the <b>Guided</b> <b>Search</b> {{model and the}} Signal Detection Theory model.

40|$|Visual {{search is}} a {{ubiquitous}} human activity. Individuals can perform a remarkable range of tasks involving {{search for a}} target object in a cluttered environment with ease and efficiency. Wolfe (1994) proposed a model called <b>Guided</b> <b>Search</b> to explain how attention can be directed to locations containing task-relevant visual features. Despite its attractive qualities, the model is complex with many arbitrary assumptions, and heuristic mechanisms that have no formal justification. We propose a new variant of the <b>Guided</b> <b>Search</b> model that treats selection of task-relevant features for attentional guidance as a problem of cue combination: each visual feature serves as an unreliable cue {{to the location of}} the target, and cues from different features must be combined to direct attention to a target. Attentional control involves modulating the level of additive noise on individual feature maps, which affects their reliability as cues, which in turn affects their ability to draw attention. We show that our Cue-Combination <b>Guided</b> <b>Search</b> model obtains results commensurate with Wolfe’s <b>Guided</b> <b>Search.</b> Through its leverage of probabilistic formulations of optimal cue combination, the model achieves a degree of mathematical elegance and parsimony, and makes a novel claim concerning the computational role of noise in attentional control...|$|E
