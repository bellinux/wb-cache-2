But surely the unprecedented gradual pace of monetary policy normalisation has played a role. Another factor could be market participants’ belief that central banks will not remain on the sidelines should unwarranted market tensions rise.

But what really caught my eye were the questions pertaining to pork. Are you willing to cook pork? Are you willing to eat pork? Many of the women (all of whom were listed as Muslim) had ticked the box that they were willing to eat pork. I have previously written about the compromises that Indonesian FDWs often make in order to please their employers and complete their contracts.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: For unknown reasons, females run {{a higher}} risk than males of work-related {{musculoskeletal}} disorders. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether male and female workers, with identical repetitive work tasks, differ concerning risk of disorders, physical or psychosocial exposures. METHODS: Employees in two industries were studied; one rubber manufacturing and one mechanical assembly plant. These industries were selected since in both, large groups of males and females worked side by side performing identical repetitive work tasks. Physical exposure was measured by technical equipment. Postures and movements were registered by inclinometry for the head and upper arms, and by electrogoniometry for the wrists. Muscular activity (muscular rest and %max) was registered by surface electromyography for m. trapezius and the forearm extensors (18 males and 19 females). Psychosocial work environment was evaluated by the demand-control-support model (85 males and 138 females). Musculoskeletal disorders were assessed (105 males and 172 females), by <b>interview</b> (<b>last</b> 7 -days complaints), and by physical examination (diagnoses). RESULTS: Concerning physical exposure, females showed higher muscular activity related to maximal voluntary contractions [(%MVE); m. trapezius: females 18 (SD 9. 2), males 12 (SD 4. 3); forearm extensors: females 39 (SD 11), males 27 (SD 10), right side, 90 th percentile]. Working postures and movements were similar between genders. Also, concerning psychosocial work environment, no significant gender differences were found. Females had higher prevalences of disorders [complaints: age-adjusted prevalence odds ratio (POR) 2. 3 (95 % CI 1. 3 - 3. 8) for neck/shoulders, 2. 4 (1. 4 - 4. 0) for elbows/hands; diagnoses: neck/shoulder 1. 9 (1. 1 - 3. 6), elbows/hands 4. 1 (1. 2 - 9. 3) ]. In 225 workers, PORs were adjusted for household work, personal recovery and exercise, which only slightly affected the risk estimates. CONCLUSION: In identical work tasks, females showed substantially higher muscular activity in relation to capacity, and higher prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders of the neck and upper extremity, than did males...|$|E
