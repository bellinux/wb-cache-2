60|$|The Pope's {{position}} was becoming extremely difficult; nevertheless, {{he wore the}} boldest possible face when he received the ambassadors of France, and on December 9 refused to grant the letters patent of passage through the Pontifical States which the French demanded.

6000|$|... "I am ready," [...] Stephen said, {{and they}} stole {{forward to the}} two {{sleeping}} men. They grasped them suddenly by the throat and held a knife before their eyes, Boldero telling them in a stern whisper that if they uttered a cry they would be stabbed to the heart.

60|$|<b>Joined</b> <b>now</b> <b>by</b> Cluny, Charles {{moved on}} that old base of Montrose, the Castle of Blair of Atholl, where the exiled duke (commonly called Marquis of Tullibardine) was {{received}} with enthusiasm. In the mid-region between Highland and Lowland, the ladies, Lady Lude and the rest, simply forced their sons, brothers, and lovers into arms. While Charles danced and made friends, and tasted his first pine-apple at Blair, James Mor took the fort of Inversnaid. At Perth (September 4-10) Charles {{was joined by}} the Duke of Perth, the Ogilvys under Lord Ogilvy, some Drummonds under Lord Strathallan, the Oliphants of Gask, and 200 Robertsons of Struan. Lord George Murray, brother of the Duke of Atholl, who had been out in 1715, out in 1719, and later was un reconcilie, came in, and with him came Discord. He had dealt as a friend and ally with Cope at Crieff; his loyalty to either side was thus not unnaturally dubious; he was suspected by Murray of Broughton; envied by Sullivan, a soldier of some experience; and though he was loyal to the last,--the best organiser, and the most daring leader,--Charles never trusted him, and his temper was always crossing that of the Prince.|$|E

50|$|By {{the spring}} of 1644 only forty of his men were left alive. <b>Joined</b> <b>now</b> <b>by</b> the {{overwintering}} party, they pushed down the Zeya to the Amur. Their reputation having preceded them, they had to fight {{their way down the}} Amur through numerous ambushes. By fall they reached the Gilyak country {{at the mouth of the}} Amur. With so many enemies behind him, Poyarkov thought it unwise to return by the same route. That winter they built boats and the next spring worked their way up the Sea of Okhotsk coast to the Ulia River and spent the next winter in the huts that had been built by Ivan Moskvitin six years earlier. The next spring, they followed Moskvitin's route along the Maya River back to Yakutsk, arriving almost exactly three years after they left.|$|E
50|$|However, {{it would}} take until September 1818 for the Wahhabi state to end with the {{surrendering}} of the its leaders. Ibrahim Pasha, Muhammad Ali’s son, {{had taken over the}} campaign in 1817. Gaining the support of the volatile Arabian tribes by skillful diplomacy and lavish gifts, he advanced into central Arabia to occupy the towns of Unaizah and Buraidah. He was <b>joined</b> <b>now</b> <b>by</b> most of the principal tribes, and marched to the Saudi capital Diriyah. Their march to Diriyah was plagued by Wahhabi attacks. They arrived in Diriyah in April 1818. It took until September for the Wahhabis to surrender, in part due to Ibrahim’s poorly trained army. Diriyah was destroyed in June 1819, and Egyptian garrisons were posted in the principal towns. The head of the Wahhabi state, Abdullah bin Saud, was sent to Istanbul to be executed.|$|E

5000|$|The first Federal {{breakthrough}} came at {{an intentional}} gap {{left in the}} Confederate line which General Alexander Reynolds’s North Carolinians and Virginians, were to fill. These regiments, however, instead of taking their proper place in line between Anderson’s Division and Brigadier Colonel Robert Tyler’s Brigade of Bate’s Division, fell back from the base through Finley’s troops atop the ridge. General Thomas J. Wood’s Yankees soon climbed the ridge, quickly exploited the breach, and forced back Colonel William F. Tucker’s Mississippi Brigade. General Finley reported that, [...] "...the left centre (Thomas C. Hindman’s Division) composed of veteran troops of tried courage, gave way in the most inexplicable manner, [...] [...] [...] almost without resistance." [...] Turning south the Federals, <b>joined</b> <b>now</b> <b>by</b> more of their comrades who had successfully scaled the ridge, proceeded to capture a Washington Artillery section of two cannon and began firing into Tyler’s flank.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Neal Eberhardt (Ralph Macchio), {{a former}} boy genius gone bitterly to seed, studies brain-damaged and {{comatose}} patients hoping {{to learn how}} the brain reroutes itself. Despite having a revolutionary new machine to work with - the Neural Intercortex Stimulation Array or NISA - Dr. Eberhardt is getting nowhere. To make matters worse, his valued assistant Vince Carter has just quit. But suddenly, Neal has a breakthrough. The brain waves of two comatose patients, Adam (Aaron Smolinski) and Lisa (Emmanuelle Vaugier), fall into sync while they're {{hooked up to the}} NISA and one of them whispers the other's name. Neal knows he's onto something and tells his boss, Marty Kilgore (Michael Sarrazin). What Neal doesn't know is that Adam and Lisa have landed in an idyllic parallel consciousness and are falling in love. As Adam and Lisa get to know each other, Neal continues his research, <b>joined</b> <b>now</b> <b>by</b> his ex-girlfriend and colleague Janice Claymore (Susannah Hoffman). Desperate to try the technique on other comatose subjects, Neal loses patience and makes the journey himself. After giving himself a calculated overdose of fentanyl, he hooks himself up to NISA and launches himself into Adam and Lisa's world. He catches a glimpse, but he's pulled back at the last minute, leaving him more determined than ever {{to find a way to}} rescue his patients from the other side. But do they really want to be rescued? Or is it really Neal that wants to cross over to the other side? ...|$|E
