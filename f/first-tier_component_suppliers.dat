40|$|Copyright © 2015 “IIE” In {{this article}} we analyze the {{interactions}} among the assembler and two <b>component</b> <b>suppliers</b> in their procurement decisions under a Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) contract. Under the VMI contract, the assembler first offers a unit price for each component and will pay <b>component</b> <b>suppliers</b> only for the amounts used to meet the actual demand. The two independent <b>component</b> <b>suppliers</b> then decide on the production quantities of their individual components before the actual demand is realized. We assume {{that one of the}} <b>component</b> <b>suppliers</b> has uncertainty in the supply process, in which the actual number of components available for assembly is equal to a random fraction of the production quantity. Under the assembly structure, both <b>component</b> <b>suppliers</b> need {{to take into account the}} underlying supply uncertainty in deciding their individual production quantities, as both components are required for the assembly of the final product. We first analyze the special case under deterministic demand and then extend our analysis to the general case under stochastic demand. We derive the optimal component prices offered by the assembler and the corresponding equilibrium production quantities of the <b>component</b> <b>suppliers...</b>|$|R

By following the WEEE and RoHS directives of the EU, and by eliminating <b>component</b> <b>suppliers</b> with negative green indexes, this study constructed an optimal decision-making model for the selection of green <b>component</b> <b>suppliers.</b> The supplier selection was conducted by considering a quantity discount mechanism under the scenario of seeking minimum total cost.

40|$|BARNES J. and KAPLINSKY R. (2000) Globalization and {{the death}} of the local firm? The {{automobile}} components sector in South Africa, Reg. Studies 34, 797 - 812. As in the case of many developing countries, South African industry is facing a new competitive environment as trade barriers fall. This involves both the need to enter external markets and to cope with new entrants in the domestic market. In the case of the South African automobile assembly industry, responding to this new global environment has increasingly meant that domestic subsidiaries are being integrated into the global strategic operations of their parent companies. This is increasingly leading them to the foreign sourcing of components, in part because of perverse and unintended consequences of the Motor Industry Development Plan. Where local production of components is involved, there is decreasing space for locally-owned <b>component</b> <b>suppliers</b> and almost no space for <b>component</b> <b>suppliers</b> using local technology. South African <b>component</b> <b>suppliers</b> are thus increasingly being relegated to highly competitive niches in mature technologies in external after-markets, making them vulnerable to exchange rates...|$|R

40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{acknowledged}} that product variety {{is an important}} source of competitive advantage for manufacturing firms. If not managed carefully, however, product variety may not be profitable to a firm due to the proliferation of <b>components</b> and <b>suppliers</b> resulting from it. In this paper, we present a product design approach for integrated <b>component</b> and <b>supplier</b> selection that (a) leverages the commonalities among products in a family, and (b) considers <b>component</b> and <b>supplier</b> selection decisions jointly to minimize the sum of design, procurement, and usage costs. We conceptualize the problem of integrated <b>component</b> and <b>supplier</b> selection and formulate it as an integer program. Analysis of the model yields two properties, complete and continuous replacement, which form the basis of a heuristic procedure. Computational tests show that the heuristic provides results close to the optimal solution and {{can be used as a}} decision support tool in selecting <b>components</b> and <b>suppliers.</b> Applica [...] ...|$|R
