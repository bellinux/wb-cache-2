50|$|Early lap steel guitars were Spanish guitars {{modified}} by raising both {{the bridge and}} <b>head</b> <b>nut.</b> The string height at the <b>head</b> <b>nut</b> was raised to about half an inch by using a <b>head</b> <b>nut</b> converter or converter nut. This type of guitar is {{claimed to have been}} invented in about 1889 by Joseph Kekuku in Hawaii.|$|E

50|$|An {{adjustable}} spanner (UK, {{and most other}} English-speaking countries) or adjustable wrench (US and Canada) is an open-end wrench with a movable jaw, allowing it {{to be used with}} different sizes of fastener <b>head</b> (<b>nut,</b> bolt, etc.) rather than just one fastener size, as with a conventional fixed spanner. Several other names are in use, including the US trademark crescent wrench.|$|E

They have further been used in bone carving, already important in prehistoric art, and also in modern time as crafting materials for buttons, beads, handles, bobbins, calculation aids, <b>head</b> <b>nuts,</b> dice, poker chips, pick-up sticks, ornaments, etc. A special genre is scrimshaw.|$|R

50|$|Typically, the {{fingerboard}} {{is a long}} plank with {{a rectangular}} profile. On a guitar, mandolin, ukulele, or similar plucked instrument, the fingerboard appears flat and wide, but may be slightly curved to form a cylindrical or conical surface of relatively large radius compared to the fingerboard width. The radius quoted in the specification of a string instrument is the radius of curvature of the fingerboard at the <b>head</b> <b>nut.</b>|$|E
50|$|Around 1979, the locking tremolo {{was invented}} by Floyd D. Rose. The locking trem became highly popular among 1980s heavy metal guitarists due to its {{extremely}} wide range of variation and tuning stability. The original Floyd Rose system {{was similar to the}} Fender synchronized tremolo, but with a number of extra mechanisms. The first to be added and most obvious is a locking plate on the <b>head</b> <b>nut,</b> tightened with a hex key to fix the strings at this point after tuning. This provides extra tuning stability, particularly during use of the vibrato arm, but as an unwanted side effect it also prevents further adjustment of the pitch using the machine heads.|$|E
5000|$|When {{working with}} common 6-point {{hexagonal}} fasteners, the 12-point shaped socket offers {{double the amount}} of starting points or possible positions by which to put the socket on the nut. This is of large importance on a box wrench which is typically adjustable in 15 or 30 degree increments. This versatility of fitting position is normally of small importance on a socket wrench which can be easily rotated in small increments regardless of socket type. Since loading contact points between the nut and socket are at the corner points (not the flats), twelve point sockets have more than adequate strength for most applications where nut and socket are in good condition. If the nut or socket is rounded by wear, using a [...] "double" [...] shaped socket {{is more likely to}} results in slippage or further rounding off and possible stripping of either the bolt <b>head,</b> <b>nut</b> or socket. This versatility is the main purpose of the 12-point shape found in common sockets, but is essential when working with 12-point bolt and nut heads. Socket strength is mainly a function of the alloys and heat treatments used to make the socket along with wall thickness of the socket wrench as measured at the corner points (thinnest section).|$|E

Due to the size and shape, they are generally manufactured as a cast iron product in accordance with ASTM A47 or A48.|$|R

5000|$|British Morris and MG engines from 1923 to 1955 {{were built}} using metric threads but with bolt <b>heads</b> and <b>nuts</b> {{dimensioned}} for Whitworth spanners and sockets. In 1919 Morris Motors {{took over the}} French Hotchkiss engine works which had moved to Coventry during the First World War. The Hotchkiss machine tools were of metric thread but metric spanners were not readily available in Britain at the time, so fasteners were made with metric thread but Whitworth heads.|$|R
40|$|The wide {{choice of}} {{cross-sectional}} shapes obtainable by extrusion process provides {{the possibility to}} individuate new joining solutions for aluminium profiles. The achievable joining technologies are very competitive with respect to conventional solutions, because {{of the possibility of}} rapid execution, optimization of parent material, treatments and machining reduction. For these reasons, the aluminium industry is very interested to enhance the knowledge about the structural behaviour of these joint systems. Bolt channel joints are one of the possible technologies that entail the advantage of the extrusion shapes for joining aluminium elements. The system consists of a track or channel section profile where a bolt <b>head,</b> <b>nuts</b> or plates with threaded holes can be located. Bolt-channel joints are commonly used in building applications and in transportation structures. Nevertheless, very little literature is available for this system and no specifications are provided by aluminium structural codes. In order to evaluate the structural behaviour of bolt-channel joints, an experimental campaign has been carried out at University ‘‘Federico II’’ of Naples. Two different cross-sections corresponding to different bolt diameters have been selected and three different load directions have been considered. The obtained experimental results have been used for the calibration of non-linear numerical models...|$|R
25|$|Either {{the bolt}} <b>head</b> or the <b>nut</b> can be torqued. If {{one has a}} larger bearing area or {{coefficient}} of friction it will require more torque to provide the same target preload. Fasteners should only be torqued if they are fitted in s.|$|R

50|$|Either {{the bolt}} <b>head</b> or the <b>nut</b> can be torqued. If {{one has a}} larger bearing area or {{coefficient}} of friction it will require more torque to provide the same target preload. Fasteners should only be torqued if they are fitted in clearance holes.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fin keel}} is {{of cast iron}} with a double resin coating to prevent {{corrosion}} and is of a hydrodynamic design supplying maximum lift with good stability. The keel is mounted to the hull and has a separate moulded keel grid that provides greater strength in this area. The keel is attached with [...] stainless steel flat <b>head</b> bolts, <b>nuts</b> and flat washers. No gasket is used to mount the keel as the mating surfaces are well matched. Keels are mounted at the factory using a silicone marine sealer between the keel and hull.|$|R
25|$|The preload {{achieved}} by torquing a bolt {{is caused by}} the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the <b>nut</b> or bolt <b>head</b> use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued bolt <b>head</b> or <b>nut</b> (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued bolt <b>head</b> or <b>nut</b> and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|R

5000|$|The {{context for}} this is the Egyptian belief that Ra (the sun god) was given birth to by Nut (the sky goddess). Nut was pictured as a naked female spread across the sky, and {{identified}} with the Milky Way [...] - [...] the legs formed by the bifurcation at Deneb in Cygnus, and the head by the swelling at Gemini. The <b>head</b> of <b>Nut</b> passes below the horizon about 75 minutes after the sun on the spring equinox, and at the same point on the horizon, [...] "consuming" [...] Ra, who was symbolically reborn 272 days later {{on the morning of the}} Winter solstice, on the same declination as Deneb.|$|R
2500|$|Typically, a bolt is {{tensioned}} (preloaded) by {{the application}} of a torque to either the bolt <b>head</b> or the <b>nut.</b> The applied torque causes the bolt to [...] "climb" [...] the thread causing a tensioning of the bolt and an equivalent compression in the components being fastened by the bolt. The preload developed in a bolt is due to the applied torque and {{is a function of the}} bolt diameter, the geometry of the threads, and the coefficients of friction that exist in the threads and under the torqued bolt <b>head</b> or <b>nut.</b> The stiffness of the components clamped by the bolt has no relation to the preload that is developed by the torque. The relative stiffness of the bolt and the clamped joint components do, however, determine the fraction of the external tension load that the bolt will carry and that in turn determines preload needed to prevent joint separation and by that means to reduce the range of stress the bolt experiences as the tension load is repeatedly applied. This determines the durability of the bolt when subjected to repeated tension loads. Maintaining a sufficient joint preload also prevents relative slippage of the joint components that would produce fretting wear that could result in a fatigue failure of those parts.|$|R
40|$|The wide {{choice of}} {{cross-sectional}} shapes obtainable by extrusion provides {{the possibility to}} individuate new joining solution for aluminium profiles. These joints, named “special” or “non-conventional” joints, are very competitive with respect to conventional solutions because {{of the possibility of}} rapid execution, optimization of parent material, treatments and machining reduction. For these reasons, the aluminium industry is very interested to enhance the knowledge about the structural behaviour of this joint typology. The work is focused on two different special joint systems: screw ports and bolt-channel joints. In particular, the first joint typology consists in a screw engaged in an open or closed slot of an extruded profile. The latter system consists in a track or channel section profile in which a bolt <b>head,</b> <b>nuts</b> or plates with threaded holes can be located. Special joints are used in several structural and non applications under low and moderate loads such as façades, door and window fixtures. But, in the last years, other structural applications like staircases, floors, pedestrian bridge, industrial furniture and shelves have been developed involving special joints. Nevertheless, very little literature is available for this system and no specifications are provided by aluminium structures codes. The main objective of this work is to overcome the lack of information about the mechanical behaviour of special joints. In order to evaluate the structural behaviour of such joint, a wide experimental campaign has been carried out. In addition, on the basis of experimental results, non-linear finite element models have been developed and calibrated...|$|R

5000|$|Under Ian Comfort's {{leadership}} AET {{also was}} involved in controversy about why the academy chain shrank in size.

5000|$|Due to the {{twisting}} or cam {{action of the}} socket on a bolt or <b>nut</b> <b>head,</b> {{nearly all of the}} torque is applied at or near the corners of the nut or bolt. Whether one uses either a twelve or six point socket the same stresses are applied in the same locations. Under load, nearly all of the flats of the nut are not touching the socket at all, it is only a small amount of the surfaces near the fastener corners which bears the torque loads. In nearly all applications over-stressing a bolt or nut will result in stripping the bolt or nut threads or breaking the bolt long before the socket will break. Tougher, thicker impact sockets are made for impact gun use. Occasionally when the corners of a bolt <b>head</b> or <b>nut</b> begin to become worn or damaged, the material the nut is made from can eventually smear or tear under load and create a situation where the corners are effectively [...] "rounded off". Some socket users believe that six point sockets are less likely to damage a fastener head, but tool evaluations and lab tests document that there is no difference in performance. A distorted or corroded fastener head may not fit a six-point socket but a twelve-point socket can be made to fit. When a fastener head is [...] "rounded off" [...] the nut or bolt can often no longer be turned without special repair or extraction tools. These rounded-off heads can incur substantial penalties, both direct and indirect. Deteriorated fasteners often inhibit the routine assembly and disassembly of the host components that rely on them, which can in turn deter users from performing normal maintenance procedures. Addressing the problem may require cost and effort, and potentially sidelining valuable equipment until the component's damaged fasteners have been replaced.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a {{formulation}} able to predict the resistance of simple shear connections realized by fastening a plate to a hollow square section by means of long bolts. The research is motivated by the fact that the rules currently provided by EC 3 for defining the bearing resistance of steel connections are limited to the case of stacks of plates, where every plate composing the connection is always restrained out of plane by the adjoining plate or by the bolt <b>head</b> or <b>nut.</b> This is a condition not verified in case of connections realized with long bolts fastening hollow sections. The work is organized in two sections. First, the results of an experimental campaign are presented and successively, the results of a parametric analysis carried out by means of a Finite Element model calibrated on the experimental data are reported. Afterwards, an analytical approach able to include the local buckling effects arising in these kinds of connections is presented, proposing a coefficient for the reduction of the resistance, to be included in the EC 3 formulation.

50|$|The Löwenherz thread form {{is unique}} in having a thread pitch angle of 53° 8′ (53.1333°), which is a smaller angle than the ISO metric thread form but a larger angle than the Thury thread form. The unusual angle was chosen so that the pitch would be {{approximately}} equal to the thread's triangular height; however, the design was later truncated (flattened) at the roots and crests of the thread {{by a factor of}} one-eight the pitch, so the pitch is about 25% larger than the height, and the thread's depth is about 75% the length of its pitch. The Löwenherz fastener is specified for 31 diameters at irregular intervals ranging from 1mm to 40mm, each with a single corresponding pitch. (This further differentiates the Löwenherz thread from the ISO metric thread, where screws must be specified by both their diameter and pitch because multiple pitches exist for a single diameter.) Löwenherz fasteners are assembled using standard metric wrenches or sockets, and often the hex size for bolt <b>heads</b> and <b>nuts</b> is repeated (so 17mm wrenches can be used on both 9mm and 10mm Löwenherz hardware).|$|R
5000|$|... (To simplify matters, {{the term}} hexagon {{will be used}} in this {{paragraph}} to denote either bolt <b>head</b> or <b>nut.)</b> Whitworth (spanner) markings refer to the bolt diameter rather than the distance across the flats of the hexagon (A/F) as in other standards. Confusion also arises because BSF hexagon sizes can be one size smaller than the corresponding Whitworth hexagon. This leads to instances where a spanner (wrench) marked 7/16BSF is the same size as one marked 3/8W. In both cases the spanner jaw width of 0.710 in, the width across the hexagon flat, is the same. However, in World War II the size of the Whitworth hexagon was reduced to {{the same size as the}} equivalent BSF hexagon purely to save metal during the war and they never went back to the old sizes afterwards. Thus it is today uncommon to encounter a Whitworth hexagon which takes the nominally correct spanner. Spanners in this case may be marked 7/16BS to indicate that they have a jaw size of 0.710 in and are designed to take either the (later) 7/16 BSW or 7/16 BSF hexagon.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Extended {{endplate}} {{connection is}} one of the most widely used beam-to column steel connections because of its fabrication simplicity, good overall performance and cost effectiveness compared with other connection types. The objective of this research is to develop three-dimensional finite element models to study the behavior of large capacity eight-bolt extended un-stiffened wide endplate steel connections, using current-technology elements instead of legacy elements which were previously used by other researchers. Approach: A finite element software package (ANSYS, version 11. 0) was used to create and analyze three finite element models. Two of the finite element models were compared with previously reported experimental results to validate the accuracy of the finite element models. The third model was based on a modification of the second finite element model to improve bolt force distribution. Eight-node brick solid elements were used to model the connection members. The bolt shank was modeled using one three-dimensional spar element that connected the bolt <b>head</b> and <b>nut</b> together. Pretension in bolts, contact algorithm and material nonlinearity were considered in the finite element models.
