5|$|After {{assessing}} the devastation in Florida and Louisiana, U.S. President George H. W. Bush initially proposed a $7.1billion aid package to provide disaster benefits, small-business loans, agricultural recovery, <b>food</b> <b>stamps,</b> <b>and</b> public housing {{for victims of}} Hurricane Andrew. After the House of Representatives appropriated aid to victims of Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii and Typhoon Omar in Guam, the cost was later increased to $11.1billion. The bill, which was the most costly disaster aid package at the time, was passed by Congress as House Resolution5620 on September18, and {{signed into law by}} President Bush on September23.

5|$|In {{an effort}} to meet the UN's goal of {{reducing}} the number of hungry people in the world by half by 2015, Ambassador McGovern formulated detailed plans, urging delivery of more surplus food to foreign school-lunch programs and the establishment of specific targets such as had been done in old American programs.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of several {{high-profile}} reports about hunger and malnutrition in the United States, the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs had been created in July 1968, with McGovern as its chair. Seeking to dramatize the problem, in March 1969 McGovern took the committee to Immokalee, Florida, the base for 20,000 migrant farm workers. They saw graphic examples of hunger and malnutrition firsthand, but also encountered resistance and complaints about bad publicity from local and state officials. McGovern battled the Nixon administration and Southerners in Congress {{during much of the}} next year over an expanded Food Stamp Program; he had to compromise on a number of points, but legislation signed in 1970 established the principles of free <b>food</b> <b>stamps</b> <b>and</b> a nationwide standard for eligibility.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{targeting}} strategy and impact on household welfare {{of two of}} the largest components of the Samurdhi welfare program in Sri Lanka - the <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> <b>and</b> microfinance programs. Combining national level household data with data on the voting patterns of the 1994 parliamentary elections, the thesis shows that households who are more likely to vote for the ruling party {{are also more likely to}} receive <b>food</b> <b>stamps.</b> This "political effect" also leads to a significant percentage of the benefits from Samurdhi being allocated to non-poor households, even though the allocations to districts are broadly pro-poor. In terms of the microfinance program, the thesis shows that households form credit groups on their own if they reside in villages that are religiously homogeneous, and therefore more likely to be socially cohesive. Loan officers can play an important role in forming credit groups in villages that are religiously diverse and among migrant households who live in government settlements, thereby increasing program coverage in these areas. The analysis in this thesis shows that both the individual and joint impact of the <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> <b>and</b> microfinance interventions are significantly positive for the per capita food consumption of the "average" household. However, the increase in per capita total expenditure is only significant for participants of the microfinance program. The results also show that the Samurdhi microfinance program leads to a large and highly significant impact on food consumption for the poorest households, whereas the <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> program has a positive impact on the total expenditure and not on food consumption. Both interventions have a larger and a more significant impact on the total expenditure of the poorest compared to better off households. The policy suggestions relate to improving the pro-poor targeting of Samurdhi <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> <b>and</b> micro-finance interventions in order to maximize their poverty impact...|$|R

25|$|The Great Recession {{had caused}} federal {{government}} revenues {{to fall to}} their lowest level relative {{to the size of}} the economy for 50 years, with tax revenues falling nearly $400 billion (20%) between 2008 and 2009. At the same time, safety net expenditures caused expenditures to rise considerably. For example, automatic stabilizer spending (such as unemployment compensation, <b>food</b> <b>stamps,</b> <b>and</b> disability payments, which increased without legislative action) ranged between $350–420 billion annually from 2009 to 2012, roughly 10% of the expenditures. This drove the budget deficit up even without any policy steps by President Obama, creating significant debt concerns. This resulted in a series of bruising debates with the Republican Congress, which attempted (with much success) to blame the President for the deficits caused primarily by the recession that began during the Bush administration.|$|E
25|$|With Mississippi's fiscal conservatism, {{in which}} Medicaid, welfare, <b>food</b> <b>stamps,</b> <b>and</b> other social {{programs}} are often cut, eligibility requirements are tightened, and stricter employment criteria are imposed, Mississippi ranks {{as having the}} second-highest ratio of spending to tax receipts of any state. In 2005, Mississippi citizens received approximately $2.02 per dollar of taxes {{in the way of}} federal spending. This ranks the state 2nd highest nationally, and represents an increase from 1995, when Mississippi received $1.54 per dollar of taxes in federal spending and was 3rd highest nationally. This figure is based on federal spending after large portions of the state were devastated by Hurricane Katrina, requiring large amounts of federal aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). However, from 1981 to 2005, it was at least number four in the nation for federal spending vs. taxes received.|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In response to concerns that individuals wanted {{in connection with a}} felony or violating terms of their parole or probation could receive benefits from programs for the needy, Congress added provisions to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 that prohibit these individuals from receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> benefits, <b>and</b> Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and make fugitive felon status ground for the termination of tenancy in federal housing assistance programs. In addition, the act directs these programs to provide law enforcement officers with information about program recipients for whom there are outstanding warrants to assist in their apprehension. Actions taken to implement the act's fugitive felon provisions have varied substantially by program. In implementing provisions to prohibit benefits to fugitive felons, all but housing assistance programs include, at a minimum, a question about fugitive felon status in their applications. SSI <b>and</b> some state <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> <b>and</b> TANF programs also seek independent verification of fugitive felon status by using computer matching to compare arrest warrant and program recipient files. To date, 110, 000 beneficiaries have been identified as fugitive felons and dropped from the SSI, <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp,</b> <b>and</b> TANF rolls, and many have been apprehended. Computerized file matching has been responsible for the identification of most of these fugitive felons. Aggressive implementation of the act's fugitive felon provisions poses a number of challenges for programs. First, centralized and complete national and statewide arrest warrant data for computer matching are not readily available. Second, because direct access to arrest warrants and criminal records is limited to law enforcement personnel, computer matching requires what many state TANF <b>and</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> officials view as a burdensome and complex negotiation process to obtain these records. Third, the absence of information and guidance about how to conduct file matching and overcome its logistical challenges has also hindered aggressive implementation of the law. Finally, there is evidence that individuals with outstanding warrants for felonies, or probation or parole violations, may continue to collect benefits because there may be differences in the interpretation of what constitutes a fugitive felon within the <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> <b>and</b> TANF programs. ...|$|R

25|$|Citizens of the United States are {{entitled}} to a host of social benefits. Government programs such as <b>Food</b> <b>Stamps</b> <b>and</b> Medicaid can provide support for low-income families. However, children who are U.S. citizens may not always be able to fully enjoy these benefits. Immigrant parents with limited English language ability may be unaware they are eligible for such benefits, or may not know how to take advantage of social welfare programs. Even legal non-citizens may find that their access to social supports is restricted due to welfare reforms. In addition, parents who are undocumented may be afraid to deal with government agencies, even if their citizen children are eligible for such assistance programs. When there is risk of deportation, it affects the likelihood of a mixed-status mother's use social services. The anti-immigrant sentiment increases this and then would deter mixed-status mothers to not to participate in government programs in which their U.S. born children are eligible to receive.|$|E
25|$|One {{narrative}} {{for explaining}} {{the economic and}} budgetary performance during President Obama's tenure uses sectoral balances. By definition, a country running a trade deficit (capital surplus) and where private savings exceeds business investment (private sector surplus) must run a government budget deficit, as the three must net to zero. Both Martin Wolf and Paul Krugman explained that as the Great Recession hit, the saving (deleveraging) {{of the private sector}} significantly increased, while business investment declined in the face of reduced consumer spending. This created an enormous private sector surplus. Since the trade deficit did not change significantly, the offset was a large increase in the government budget deficit. The record drop in tax revenue and large increases in automatic stabilizer expenditures (such as unemployment compensation, <b>food</b> <b>stamps,</b> <b>and</b> disability payments) were the mechanism for much of the additional deficit and debt increases, even before new economic policies were implemented. The significant reduction in demand implied by the increase in the private sector surplus (i.e., consumers and businesses saving rather than spending or investing) created a severe recession.|$|E
25|$|Reagan's {{support for}} an {{increased}} defense budget {{at the height of}} the Cold War was supported by Congressional Democrats and Republicans. However, Congress was reluctant to follow Reagan's proposed cuts in domestic programs. In accordance with Reagan's less-government intervention views, many domestic government programs were cut or experienced periods of reduced funding during his presidency. These included Social Security, Medicaid, <b>Food</b> <b>Stamps,</b> <b>and</b> federal education programs. Though Reagan protected entitlement programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, in one of the most widely criticized actions of the administration, the administration attempted to purge tens of thousands of allegedly disabled people from the Social Security disability roles, who the administration alleged were not truly disabled. Funding for government organizations, including the Environmental Protection Agency, were also reduced. He cut the EPA's budget by 22%, and his director of the EPA, Anne M. Burford, resigned over alleged mismanagement of funds. Tax breaks and increased military spending created a larger budget deficit, which led Reagan to approve two tax increases, aiming to preserve funding for Social Security.|$|E
