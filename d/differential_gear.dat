5|$|An enquiry {{into the}} crash was hastily set up. The commission's report (Aktenzeichen 52, Br.B.Nr. 270/42) {{concluded}} that the crash was caused by damage to the <b>differential</b> <b>gear,</b> which caused an oil leak. Then a number of teeth broke off the spur wheel and ignited the oil. Sabotage or human error was ruled out. The aircraft, W. Nr. 14256, was ferried to the unit via Bari, Italy. The mission that ended in its destruction was its first mission.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the Han dynasty, when the state needed to {{accurately}} measure distances traveled throughout the empire, the Chinese relied on a mechanical odometer. The Chinese odometer was a wheeled carriage, its gearwork being driven by {{the rotation of the}} carriage's wheels; specific units of distance—the Chinese li—were marked by the mechanical striking of a drum or bell as an auditory signal. The specifications for the 11th century odometer were written by Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong, who is quoted extensively in the historical text of the Song Shi (compiled by 1345). In the Song period, the odometer vehicle was also combined with another old complex mechanical device known as the south-pointing chariot. This device, originally crafted by Ma Jun in the 3rd century, incorporated a <b>differential</b> <b>gear</b> that allowed a figure mounted on the vehicle to always point in the southern direction, no matter how the vehicle's wheels turned about. The concept of the <b>differential</b> <b>gear</b> that was used in this navigational vehicle is now found in modern automobiles in order to apply an equal amount of torque to a car's wheels even when they are rotating at different speeds.|$|E
5|$|Many Chinese Buddhist monks came to Japan to help {{further the}} spread of Buddhism as well. Two 7th-century monks in particular, Zhi Yu and Zhi You, visited the court of Emperor Tenji (r. 661–672), whereupon they {{presented}} a gift of a south-pointing chariot that they had crafted. This 3rd century mechanically driven directional-compass vehicle (employing a <b>differential</b> <b>gear)</b> was again reproduced in several models for Tenji in 666, as recorded in the Nihon Shoki of 720. Japanese monks also visited China; {{such was the case}} with Ennin (794–864), who wrote of his travel experiences including travels along China's Grand Canal. The Japanese monk Enchin (814–891) stayed in China from 839 to 847 and again from 853 to 858, landing near Fuzhou, Fujian and setting sail for Japan from Taizhou, Zhejiang during his second trip to China.|$|E

Based {{on the characteristics}} of <b>differential</b> <b>geared</b> mechanisms, characteristics of non-fractionated <b>differential</b> <b>geared</b> mechanisms are laid out. Admissible non-fractionated <b>differential</b> <b>geared</b> mechanisms can be identi ed from atlases of geared kinematic chains by checking the redundancy condition in a kinematic equation governing the terminals.

Therefore, {{it is very}} {{important}} to know the dynamic behavior of <b>differential</b> <b>gears,</b> In the present paper, the dynamic behavior of <b>differential</b> <b>gears</b> were investigated by measuring the torque variations of one drive and two driven shafts under conditions where one driven shaft was rotated at a fixed speed, and the other at a variable speed by varying the speed of the drive shaft. Furtheremore, under conditions where hypoid gear was assembled with complete tooth bearing, heel tooth bearing, or hard heel tooth bearing, the dynamic behavior of <b>differential</b> <b>gears</b> was investigated by measuring the tooth root stresses of hypoid gear was and the torque variations of each shaft. In comparison with these measured data, the effect of tooth bearing on the dynamic behavior of <b>differential</b> <b>gears</b> became clear...|$|R

5|$|Puppet theater, waterwheel-powered: The {{mechanical}} toys of Roman Egypt, {{especially the}} weight-driven puppet theater of Heron of Alexandria (c. 10–70 AD), {{are well known}} and discussed by historians such as Beck, Prou, and de Rochas d'Aiglun. In China, Zhang Heng (78–139) wrote of plays with artificial fish and dragons, while a 6th-century text Xijing Zaji states that when Liu Bang (reigned as Emperor Gaozu of Han from 202–195 BC) came upon the treasury of the deceased Qin Shihuang (r. 221–210) in 206 BC, he found an entire mechanical orchestra of 1m (3ft) tall puppets dressed in silk and playing mouth organs, all powered by pulling ropes and blowing into tubes. As written in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, the engineer Ma Jun (fl. 220–265)—already associated with the <b>differential</b> <b>gear</b> system of the south-pointing chariot—invented a mechanical theater powered by a rotating wooden waterwheel for the entertainment of Emperor Ming's (r. 226–239 AD) court. With the waterwheel in motion, a number of mechanical puppets performed tricks, such as singing girls who played music and danced, other puppets who would beat drums and sound flutes when one puppet entered the scene, puppets dancing on balls, throwing swords, hanging upside down on rope ladders, etc. Other mechanical puppets dressed as government officials did tasks in their offices, puppets dressed as laborers did jobs of pounding and grinding (trip hammer and millstone), while others watched cockfighting, all moving simultaneously. Water-powered puppet theaters {{in the tradition of}} Ma Jun were created in later dynasties as well.|$|E

The U.S. Navy Mk.1 gun fire control computer used about 160 differentials of the bevel-gear type.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{mechanical}} engineer Michael Wright {{has demonstrated that}} there was a mechanism to supply the lunar phase in addition to the position. The indicator was a small ball embedded in the lunar pointer, half-white and half-black, which rotated to show the phase (new, first quarter, half, third quarter, full, and back) graphically. The data to support this function is available given the sun and moon positions as angular rotations; essentially, it is the angle between the two, translated into the rotation of the ball. It requires a <b>differential</b> <b>gear,</b> a gearing arrangement that sums or differences two angular inputs. Among its other first-known aspects, the Antikythera Mechanism is the earliest extant construction of a deliberate <b>differential</b> <b>gear</b> scheme in history.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{hypothesis}} that the south-pointing chariot used <b>differential</b> <b>gears</b> has gained wide acceptance, it should be recognized that functional south-pointing chariots without <b>differential</b> <b>gears</b> are possible. The ancient descriptions are often unclear, but they suggest that the Chinese implemented several different designs, at least some of which did not include differentials.|$|R
25|$|If the south-pointing chariot {{were built}} {{perfectly}} accurately, using a <b>differential</b> <b>gear,</b> {{and if it}} travelled on an Earth that was perfectly smooth, it would have interesting properties. It would be a mechanical compass that transports a direction, given by the pointer, along the path it travels. Mathematically the device performs parallel transport along the path it travels.|$|E
25|$|A <b>differential</b> <b>gear</b> train {{can be used}} {{to allow}} a {{difference}} between two input axles. Mills often used such gears to apply torque in the required axis. Differentials are also used in this way in watchmaking to link two separate regulating systems with the aim of averaging out errors. Greubel Forsey use a differential to link two double tourbillon systems in their Quadruple Differential Tourbillon.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, A. J. M. Chadwick {{patented}} a 4WD system, GB 1113068, {{that used}} hemispherical wheels for an all-terrain vehicle. Twenty years later, B. T. E. Warne, patented, GB 2172558, an improvement on Chadwick's design {{that did not}} use <b>differential</b> <b>gear</b> assemblies. By using near-spherical wheels with provision to tilt and turn each wheel co-ordinatively, the driven wheels maintain constant traction. Furthermore, all driven wheels steer and, as pairing of wheels is not necessary, vehicles with an odd number of wheels are possible without affecting the system's integrity. Progressive deceleration is made possible by dynamically changing the front-to-rear effective wheel diameter ratios.|$|E
25|$|The Antikythera mechanism, {{an ancient}} Greek astronomical {{observational}} device for calculating {{the movements of}} the Sun and the Moon, possibly the planets, dates from about 150–100 BC, and was the first ancestor of an astronomical computer. It was discovered in an ancient shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete. The device became famous for its use of a <b>differential</b> <b>gear,</b> previously believed to have been invented in the 16th century, and the miniaturization and complexity of its parts, comparable to a clock made in the 18th century. The original mechanism is displayed in the Bronze collection of the National Archaeological Museum of Athens, accompanied by a replica.|$|E
25|$|If the {{hypothesis}} is true, then the Chinese probably knew about differentials centuries before Europeans. There has been {{speculation that the}} ancient Greeks knew about them in about 100 BCE, but this is now considered unlikely. The first true <b>differential</b> <b>gear</b> definitely {{known to have been}} used in the Western world was by Joseph Williamson in 1720. He used a differential for correcting the equation of time for a clock that displayed both mean and solar time. Even then, the differential was not fully appreciated in Europe until James White emphasized its importance and provided details for it in his Century of Inventions (1822).|$|E
50|$|Overall {{drivetrain}} reduction {{comes down}} to three basic factors: transmission <b>gearing</b> (including overdrive), <b>differential</b> <b>gearing</b> (in the axle), and tire size. The rotation speed problem comes into effect when the <b>differential</b> <b>gearing</b> is a high ratio and an overdrive is used to compensate. This may create unpleasant vibrations at high speeds and possible destruction of the driveshaft due to the centripetal forces or uneven balance.|$|R

5000|$|A {{differentially}} steered robot {{is similar}} to the <b>differential</b> <b>gears</b> used in automobiles in that both the wheels can have different rates of rotations, but unlike the <b>differential</b> <b>gearing</b> system, a differentially steered system will have both the wheels powered. Differential wheeled robots are used extensively in robotics, since their motion is easy to program and can be well controlled. Virtually all consumer robots on the market today use differential steering primarily for its low cost and simplicity.|$|R
25|$|Some of {{the ancient}} {{descriptions}} suggest that some south-pointing chariots could move in only three ways: straight ahead, or turning left or right with a fixed radius of curvature. A third wheel might {{have been used to}} fix the turning radius. If the chariot was turning, the pointing doll was connected by gears to one or other of the two main road wheels (e.g. whichever was {{on the outside of the}} curve around which the chariot was moving) so the doll rotated at a fixed speed, relative to the rate of the chariot's movement, to compensate for the predetermined rate of turn. The doll turned in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was connected to it, so its rotation compensated for the chariot turning left or right. This design would have been simpler than using a <b>differential</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
25|$|Considerable scepticism is {{therefore}} warranted {{as to whether}} this type of south-pointing chariot, using a <b>differential</b> <b>gear</b> for the whole time, was used in practice to navigate over long distances. Conceivably, the south-pointing doll was fixed {{to the body of}} the chariot while it was travelling in straight lines, and coupled to the differential only when the chariot was turning. The charioteer could have operated a control to do this just before and after making each turn, or maybe shouted commands to someone inside the chariot who connected and disconnected the doll and the differential. This could have been done without stopping the chariot. If turns were brief and rare, this would have greatly reduced the pointing errors, since they would have accumulated only during the short periods when the doll and differential were connected. However, it raises the problem of how the chariot could have been kept travelling in straight lines with sufficient accuracy without using the pointing doll.|$|E
