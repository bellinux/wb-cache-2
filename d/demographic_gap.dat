40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{demographic}} deterioration on Greek labour supply, and the possible labour shortages that it may entail. Through a disaggregated approach by occupation and region, the paper predicts, for the year 2000, the new entry to and exit from the labour force, as well as labour requirements. Various methods are used, such as temporal shifts of youth and workers by age brackets for predicting net demographic additions to the labour force, shift and share analysis for decomposing employment changes, and the manpower requirements approach for predicting employment through output and productivity projections. The occupational and regional predictions are mostly done by top-down calculations. Finally, a formula is invented for measuring the occupational and regional intensity of demographic deficits. Despite the predicted demographic deficits in almost all regions of the country, immigrants and other additional workers to the job market will fill the <b>demographic</b> <b>gap,</b> {{but many of them}} will also remain unemployed.

Without further immigration, the total labor force in Europe and Russia, the high-income countries of East Asia and the Pacific, China, and, to a lesser extent, North America is projected to be reduced by 29 million by 2025 and by 244 million by 2050.

It provides a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of existing recruitment and retention tools in light of the generational differences between current policy makers (Baby Boomers) and needed younger employees (Generation-X). Key generational characteristics are compared and assessed in relation to workforce recruitment and retention tools. The research indicates that although a generation gap exists it is not so large that bridges cannot be built. Personnel tools can be modified or created to enable culture change so that Generation-X values are embraced in the workplace. Of the existing tools, flextime; lateral movement and education opportunities; and the demo project appear most promising since they offer individual flexibility and empowerment. Among other things, this thesis recommends to increase internships; advertise career broadening and lateral movement opportunities; and centralize all job opportunities to a single site open to all interested applicants.

40|$|We use panel data on Florida {{high school}} {{students}} to examine race, poverty, and gender disparities in advanced course-taking. While white {{students are more likely to}} take advanced courses than black and Hispanic students, these disparities are eliminated when we condition on observable pre-high school characteristics. In fact, black and Hispanic students are more likely than observably similar white students to take advanced courses. Controlling for students' pre-high school characteristics substantially reduces poverty gaps, modestly reduces Asian-white gaps, and makes little dent in female-male gaps. Black and Hispanic students attend high schools that increase their likelihood of taking advanced courses relative to observably similar white students; this advantage is largely driven by minorities disproportionately attending magnet schools. Finally, recent federal and state efforts aimed at increasing access to advanced courses to poor and minority students appear to have succeeded in raising the share of students who take advanced courses from 2003 to 2006. However, secular trends (or spillovers of the policies to non-poor, non-minority students) have spurred faster growth for other students, contributing to widening <b>demographic</b> <b>gaps</b> in these years. © 2009 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. ...|$|R
50|$|Different {{approaches}} {{have attempted to}} explain this. Some argue that the main driver of transnationalism has been the development of technologies that have made transportation and communication more accessible and affordable, thus dramatically changing the relationship between people and places. It is now possible for immigrants to maintain closer and more frequent contact with their home societies than ever before.However, the integration of international migrations to the demographic future of many developed countries is another important driver for transnationalism. Beyond simply filling a demand for low-wage workers, migration also fills the <b>demographic</b> <b>gaps</b> created by declining natural populations in most industrialized countries. Today, migration accounts for 3/5 of population growth on western countries as a whole. And this trend {{shows no sign of}} slowing down. Moreover, global political transformations and new international legal regimes have weakened the state as the only legitimate source of rights. Decolonization, coupled with the fall of communism and the ascendance of human rights, have forced states to take account of persons qua persons, rather than persons qua citizens. As a result, individuals have rights regardless of their citizenship status within a country.Others, from a neo-marxist approach, argue that transnational class relations have come about which have occurred concomitant with novel organizational and technological advancements and the spread of transnational chains of production and finance.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{food supply}} and dietary {{preferences}} {{have changed in}} recent decades. Objective: We studied time- and age-related individual and population-wide changes in a dietary quality score and food groups during 1985 – 2006. Design: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study of 5115 black and white men and women [aged 18 – 30 y at year 0 (1985 – 1986) ] assessed diet at examinations at study years 0, 7 (1992 – 1993), and 20 (2005 – 2006). The dietary quality score, which was validated by its inverse association with cardiovascular disease risk, summed 46 food groups rated by investigators as positive or negative {{on the basis of}} hypothesized health effects. We used repeated-measures regression to estimate time-specific mean diet scores and servings per day of food groups. Results: In 2652 participants with all 3 diet assessments, the mean (±SD) dietary quality score increased from 64. 1 ± 13. 0 at year 0 to 71. 1 ± 12. 6 at year 20, which was mostly attributable to increased age. However, the secular trend, which was estimated from differences of dietary quality scores across time at a fixed age (age-matched time trend) decreased. The diet score was higher in whites than in blacks and in women than in men and increased with education, but <b>demographic</b> <b>gaps</b> in the score narrowed over 20 y. There tended to be increases in positively rated food groups and decreases in negatively rated food groups, which were generally similar in direction across demographic groups.

40|$|The key task of {{this paper}} is to show the {{historic}} variability or arbitrariness of interethnic relations in our case study, in the village of Csenyete, in Northeast Hungary. We will show that Roma experience in this village moved in a cyclical way from relatively high levels of integration to segregation, back to assimilation and back again to higher level of segregation. The empirical puzzle we try to solve is whether the Gypsies of Csenyete always lived an shantytown at the outskirts of the village before the whole village was turned into a Roma ghetto by the 1980 s? We present evidence that the shantytown is a relatively recent development and in the mid- 19 h century Roma lived inside the village. Csenyete was 'ethnically cleansed' at the turn of the 19 th and 20 th centuries, hence the Roma who began to move into the village recently are only 'returning home'. Does this matter? Who cares whether Roma lived in the 19 th century inside the village and was cleansed into shantytowns later, or whether they always lived in their own settlements? This paper offers evidence that the type and extent of segregation is highly consequential for the life chances of people involved. We will show that the social, economic and <b>demographic</b> <b>gap</b> (such as infant mortality, out of wedlock birth, the age of the mother at the birth of the first child) between various ethnic groups and in particular between 'peasants' and Roma varied over time. The <b>demographic</b> <b>gap</b> was narrower during the mid- 19 th century than a century later, it narrowed again during the first decades of socialism in order to increase after the mid- 1980 s. Our aim is also to make contribution to the theory of ethnicity. We will show that the changes in the social conditions of the Roma of Csenyete call for a re-conceptualization of the structural position they occupy in society. We propose that the Roma of our village could be seen as constituting a 'lower class' during the 19 th century, defined as an under-caste during the first decades of the 20 th century and it is being forced into an underclass position after the fall of socialism. Hence we offer an empirically based, historically specific theory of the 'underclass'. This way we try to transcend the mainly ideological and often simply terminological underclass-debate.

40|$|Introduction. In recent years, {{the global}} {{discussion}} on {{migration and asylum}} has evolved from polarization of perspectives and mistrust, to improving partnerships and fostering cooperation between countries and regions. The paradigm has shifted from control and security exclusively to an increased awareness of the ramifications of migration in development and labour markets, the increasing <b>demographic</b> <b>gap</b> 1 and the dangers of exclusion faced by migrant workers (regular or irregular). Eastern Europe will suffer the biggest population decline in the coming years, and Nigeria’s population will reach one billion by 2100. In Europe, the work replacement ratio will be two pensioners for one active worker. It has become clear that these facts cannot be ignored {{and that there is}} a need for greater convergence of policies (migration/mobility, fundamental rights, and economic growth), with a migrant-centred approach. 2. The assumption that Europe will remain a geopolitical and economic hub that attracts immigrants at all skill levels might not hold water in the long run. The evolving demographic and economic changes have made it evident that the competitiveness of the EU (Europe 2020 Strategy) is also at stake, particularly if an adaptable workforce with the necessary skills is not secured in view of shortfalls in skill levels and because of serious labour mismatches. Therefore, it is the right moment to develop more strategic and long-term migration policies that take into account the evolving position of Europe and its neighbours in the world. By the same token, labour market strategies that meet needs and promote integration of regular migrants are still a pending task for the Member States (MS) in terms of the free movement of people, but also in relation with neighbouring and partner countries...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 This {{research}} {{documents the}} experiences of Teacher Candidates of Color (TCCs) during their K- 8 teacher preparation program at a Predominantly White Institution. The study followed the TCCs in two different learning environments: their university courses and their school placement sites in order to discover in what ways, if any, their learning experiences were afforded or constrained by their racial and cultural identities. Findings suggest that school placement sites were especially beneficial for TCCs when their cultural and linguistic heritages were congruent with the students, families, and communities in which their school placement was located. At times the TCCs’ learning opportunities were constrained by their cultural and linguistic identities. These moments {{were more likely to}} occur in the university courses due to the program’s focus on culturally responsive instruction that was not consistently demonstrated in their program. These findings have implications for how teacher preparation programs at PWIs can better focus learning experiences for TCCs. Teacher preparation programs, school districts, and communities are struggling to better meet the needs of K- 12 students whose racial, cultural, and linguistic identities differ from most of their teachers. One strategy to better meet the needs of K- 12 students is {{to increase the number of}} teachers of color. By increasing the number of teachers of color in the K- 12 teaching workforce, the <b>demographic</b> <b>gap</b> can be reduced with the overall goal of increasing academic outcomes for all students, particularly students of color.

40|$|The {{contemporary}} refugee crises {{across the}} Middle East, Asia, and Africa {{have captured the}} world’s attention. Much of the existing discourse {{has focused on the}} humanitarian and security implications that this crisis will have, specifically for developed regions such as the European Union. This paper, on the other hand, seeks to explore this issue through a purely economic lens, focusing instead on the economic impacts that refugees have on the countries that receive them. Through exploring the existing academic and popular literature around historical and contemporary case studies, this paper has identified some of the key positive and negative economic effects that refugee crises can have on the host country. On the positive side, refugees can be a boon to the host country by (1) spurring long-term investment (2) filling needed <b>demographic</b> <b>gaps</b> (3) integrating effectively into the labor market (4) becoming productive economic consumers and producers and (5) by increasing bilateral trade with the country of origin. On the negative side, refugees can be a burden to the host country by (1) straining public and private services (2) causing physical and economic overcrowding and (3) increasing societal strife and the potential for civil conflict. The paper then turns to the contemporary refugee crisis in Lebanon by examining the relevance of these aforementioned positive and negative effects to the Lebanese case. Along the way, the paper provides policy recommendations that can be employed in the Lebanese case to amplify the positive benefits of refugees while mitigating the negative consequences. Ultimately, the paper hopes to use past refugee crises as an instruction point for how Lebanon can cope with its current crisis. By learning from past examples and applying existing literature to the current crisis, it is this author’s hope that the refugee crisis can be an eventual boon to the Lebanese economy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theory where increases in {{female labor force}} participation and reductions in the gender wage-gap are generated {{as part of the}} same process of demographic transition that leads to reductions in fertility. There have been significant increases in the labor supply of women in the last decades, both in developed and developing countries. Traditional views explain this trend through the effects of reduced fertility and/or increased women's wages. The paper suggests that all these changes can be understood as part of a single process of demographic change, triggered by reductions in mortality. Mortality reductions affect the incentives of individuals to invest in human capital and to have children. Particularly, gains in adult longevity reduce fertility, increase investments in market human capital, increase female labor force participation, and reduce the wage differential between men and women. Child mortality reductions cannot generate this same pattern of changes. The model reconciles the increase in female labor market participation with the timing of age-specific mortality reductions observed during the demographic transition. The paper presents the first model to link the change in {{the role of women in}} society to, ultimately, the reductions in mortality that characterize the <b>demographic</b> transitiongender wage <b>gap,</b> <b>demographic</b> transition, female labor force participation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractImplementing {{geologic}} {{storage of}} carbon dioxide at a scale large {{enough to make a}} difference will require an industry of magnitude comparable to the current oil and gas industry (Bryant [1]; Orr [2]). Such an enterprise will require substantial human capital, but recognition of this need has been largely missing from discussions of GHG mitigation. To design, build, implement, optimize, troubleshoot, monitor and regulate large-scale carbon dioxide storage projects will require subsurface engineers. The same technologies that apply to hydrocarbon production apply to the subsurface storage {{of carbon dioxide}}. Thus one might naturally expect to hire petroleum engineering (PE) graduates to staff a carbon storage industry. We argue that it is unrealistic to depend on PE graduates to staff the carbon storage industry, for three reasons: (i) continued large demand for hydrocarbons is unlikely to abate; (ii) a <b>demographic</b> <b>gap</b> in {{the oil and gas industry}} will continue to place an extraordinary premium on new graduates; and (iii) existing PE departments in the US and abroad are already operating at or above capacity. In short, there are neither classrooms nor faculty sufficient to educate enough petroleum engineers for the petroleum industry. Even if there were, it would be difficult for an emerging carbon storage industry to compete for graduates with oil and gas companies. We advocate that the solution to this manpower problem is building new educational infrastructure. We propose a prototype program based on an existing accredited multidisciplinary degree program at The University of Texas at Austin, known as Geosystems Engineering and Hydrogeology. Offered jointly by the Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering Department and the Department of Geological Sciences, this program combines the fundamentals of petroleum engineering with the subsurface architecture emphasis of geology and the environmental perspective of hydrogeology. The latter is salient given the priority of protecting groundwater resources during geologic storage. With modest redesign of the curriculum but with substantial expansion of classrooms, laboratories and faculty, we argue that the program would be able to graduate significant numbers of “carbon management engineers” within six years. The problem of timing is particularly difficult. The lead time to develop such a program is long, even when starting from an existing degree program. A geologic storage industry will not begin until a regulatory framework and some form of carbon market or price are established. Ensuring that the carbon management industry is not starved of talent will thus require a rare combination of shared vision amongst university administrators, government agencies and industry...|$|E
40|$|This {{study has}} been {{conducted}} for the Australian Crime Commission 2 ̆ 7 s National Indigenous Intelligence Task Force (NIITF). An objective of the NIITF is to conduct research on intelligence and information co-ordination and identification of good practice in the prevention, detection and responses to violence and child abuse in Indigenous communities. Responding to {{children and young people}} with sexualised or sexual offending behaviours presents significant challenges across the allied health, child protection, education and juvenile justice sectors. This report maps the specialised therapeutic services designed to effect positive behavioural change and thus divert young people with sexualised behaviours from the juvenile justice system. Accurate numbers on children with sexualised or sexual offending behaviours are difficult to determine. Recent Australian research cites international data to estimate that sexual abuse by children or young people constitutes between 40 and 90 per cent of sexual offending against children. Even the lower estimate belies the generally held assumption that perpetrators of child sexual assault are adult males. Young people are responsible for a significant proportion of sex offences against children, a fact that continues to go largely unknown. There are several factors contributing to this gap in understanding. These include entrenched ideals about children as inherently innocent, widespread ignorance about developmental sexuality, and the tendency of both young people and parents to deny or minimise incidents when they do occur. In Australia, data on children with sexualised behaviours are not collected uniformly and non-disclosure contributes to what might be large numbers of offences going undetected. Mandatory reporting requirements apply where children display sexualised behaviours and are thought to be at risk of harm. Yet a general lack of knowledge as to what constitutes appropriate behaviour means that many may respond inappropriately to incidents of sexualised behaviours. This context of confusion, denial and non-disclosure creates a hidden population of children that continues to be at risk. Attention to redressing the contexts for non-disclosure is urgently required to ensure that children in need are provided with specialised therapeutic care. Scholars and clinicians agree that the ‘earliest possible intervention’ leads to the best rehabilitative outcomes for the young people involved. Clinical studies indicate that recidivism rates are low where a full program of specialised counselling is completed. Despite these positive findings, {{there are a number of}} key challenges to the comprehensive provision of tertiary services to young people who have sexualised behaviours. This report presents qualitative data from interviews with specialised clinicians as well as submissions from service providers in both community and youth justice settings.

We analysed published demographic data on the world's wildfowl to examine taxonomic and geographic biases in study, and to identify gaps in knowledge. Wildfowl (order: Anseriformes) are a comparatively well studied bird group which includes 169 species of duck, goose and swan. In all, 1, 586 wildfowl research papers published between 1911 and 2010 were found using Web of Knowledge (WoK) and Google Scholar. Over half of the research output involved just 15 species from seven genera. Research output was strongly biased towards 'high income' countries, common wildfowl species, and measures of productivity, rather than survival and movement patterns. There were significantly fewer demographic data for the world's 31 threatened wildfowl species than for non-threatened species. Since 1994, the volume of demographic work on threatened species has increased more than for non-threatened species, but still makes up only 2. 7 % of total research output.

This article estimates the labor supply effects, complementing an earlier paper {{in which the}} authors have modeled the effects of scale and aging. Labor supply effects on future CO 2 emissions are approximated based on recent survey data on earnings differences between immigrant and native-born households and on existing <b>demographic</b> projections. <b>Gaps</b> in average earnings {{are found to be}} substantial only for Hispanic immigrants, between 25 and 47 percent below native-born peers, depending on the age group and measure used. Impacts are estimated using a range of population projections and assumptions about future convergence, or assimilation, of the earnings of immigrants and their descendents to those of the descendents of the native-born population. If per capita earnings differences remain near current levels, the aggregate effects on per capita earnings and consumption are found to be affected more by {{the rate at which the}} immigrant population's earnings converge to native-born levels than by projected differences in future immigration. If assimilation is rapid, the impacts of immigration are proportional to the size of the first generation and negligible, regardless of the level of immigration. If future assimilation is impeded, the marginal impacts will be more substantial and vary with the level of immigration but still well below 10 % in 2100 when calculated using the preferred measure of earning differences and only exceed 10 % when the impacts are calculated using the alternate per capita earnings differences...|$|R

40|$|Two {{prominent}} {{issues are}} affecting {{the vitality of}} regional settlements in the New Zealand context. Firstly, urbanisation has meant the migration of young workers and professionals to creative and economic urban centres, leaving <b>demographic</b> <b>gaps</b> in the regions and a dwindling population. Secondly, the exploitation of regional landscapes by cities has led to severe degradation of extensive wetland ecosystems. Wetlands drained for farming, large-scale deforestation and industrial settlements established to support agriculture and forestry contribute to the artificial landscape morphology. New Zealand’s waterways and lakes now suffer from eutrophication; an enrichment of nutrients caused by dairy run-off and increased sediments, characterised by a build-up of organic matter producing toxic algae bloom. Titled ‘Renewal of the Abject’, this project is a speculative design that aims to reconcile the problematic relationship between the dairy industry and the environment. Architectural infrastructure and landscape renewal present an opportunity to challenge current urban planning tendencies in the Horowhenua District. The project proposes to reinvigorate small towns with a self-sufficient and forward planning urban framework. Levin, a prominent industrial town at {{the centre of the}} Horowhenua District, clings to the vital transport connection between Wellington and Auckland, feeding off the economic lifeline of passing traffic. With the proposed changes by NZTA to create a State Highway One Bypass east of Levin, the CBD may suffer economically leading to population decline. Lake Horowhenua, west of the town centre, was once the heart of the District with an abundance of food and natural resources. It is now considered one of the worst lakes in New Zealand based on its poor condition. Integrating infrastructure and megastructure challenges modernist attempts to zone cities by function and aims to build clean infrastructure integrated into compact urban areas. Architecture as infrastructure challenges the public understanding of production and manufacturing and their natural consequences. A redefinition of industry for the twenty-first century could improve its detrimental relationship with the environment. Clean infrastructure eliminates the need to build industries on remote brown sites, focusing on the prevention of adverse effects on the landscape and the population’s health and wellbeing. The concept of using manure-loam composite as a structural building material provides new opportunities for cost-effective architecture for towns that are economically struggling. The material is renewable and easily accessed in New Zealand, while rammed earth construction enables future growth and expansion. Using an artistic approach in constructing manure-loam buildings has the potential to produce an aesthetic distinctive of rural New Zealand. ‘Renewal of the Abject’ proposes a Megastructure to enforce a powerful urban connection between the hills and the lake with a self-sufficient spine making use of dairy waste and sewage as a building material. The reimagining of this abject materiality forms a critical discourse throughout the project influencing additional design explorations. This thesis explores current thinking around urban planning, Material production and reuse, and architectural detailing through design-led research. Perhaps, presenting an issue of scope where design exploration entered different academic fields, touching upon charged lines of research, rather than solely interrogating the architectural discipline. Proposing a megastructure in the Horowhenua district would seem counterproductive in this degraded landscape. However, compacting urban sprawl into a dense core along the eastwest axis sets out a development framework that conserves land and maximises public activity at the centre of a currently sleepy town. The megastructure can expand along this line, servicing the functions of Levin in a self-sufficient manner, unlike a typical New Zealand strip town that feeds off services along the main highway. Integrating infrastructure and megastructure challenges modernist attempts to zone cities by function and aims to build clean infrastructure integrated into compact urban areas.

40|$|Results from a {{national}} representative telephone survey of Americans in 2000 show that Internet and mobile phone usage was very similar, and that several digital divides exist with respect to both Internet and mobile phone usage. The study identifies and analyzes three kinds of digital divides for both the Internet and mobile phones [...] users/nonuser, veteran/recent, and continuing/dropout [...] and similarities and differences among those digital divides based on <b>demographic</b> variables. The <b>gap</b> between Internet users and nonusers is associated with income and age, but no longer with gender and race, once other variables are controlled. The gap between mobile phone users and nonusers is associated with income, work status, and marital status. The veteran/recent Internet gap is predicted by income, age, education, phone user, membership in community religious organizations, having children, and gender; for mobile phones, age, work status and marital status are predictors. The gap between continuing and dropout users is predicted by education for Internet usage and income for mobile phone usage. Finally, cross-categorization of Internet and mobile phone usage/nonusage is distinguished (significantly though weakly) primarily by income and education. Thus, there are several digital divides, each predicted by somewhat different variables; and while Internet and mobile phone usage levels in 2000 were about the same, their users overlap but do not constitute completely equivalent populations.

40|$|Although {{access to}} a postsecondary {{education}} has increased exponentially since 1970, {{access to a}} bachelor’s degree has not grown as swiftly. Moreover, while national longitudinal trend data highlight improvements in bachelor’s degree completion in the aggregate, they disguise important disparities in bachelor’s degree completion across groups. Specifically, these data mask inequality in bachelor’s degree attainment across and within groups, particularly groups defined by gender, ethnicity/race, and socioeconomic status. ^ Conceptual models accompanying research on bachelor’s degree completion have included both student- and institution-level characteristics. Although these models have shed light on disparities in completion with respect to gender, ethnicity/race, and socioeconomic status, few predictive models incorporate the interaction of these <b>demographic</b> constructs. Since <b>gaps</b> in bachelor’s degree completion persist both within and across groups, additional consideration of interactions may prove helpful for future retention efforts. ^ Using Tinto’s conceptual model of student departure, this dissertation examines a model of bachelor’s degree completion, focusing on the interaction of gender, ethnicity/race, and socioeconomic status. Framed by critical race feminist theory, this research acknowledges variance in privilege and marginalization by gender, ethnicity/race, and socioeconomic status, {{as well as the}} interaction of these characteristics. Logistic regression analyses are used to identify likelihood of degree completion within six years using the Beginning Postsecondary Students data set. ^ Descriptive analyses show that gender, ethnicity/race, socioeconomic status groups are related to bachelor’s degree completion and suggest that these variables may interact to predict bachelor’s degree completion. Nonetheless, none of the interactions were statistically significant in the logistic regression analyses. This research highlights the differences in conceptual and statistical interactions, and how additional research may be needed both theoretically and empirically. Implications for policy and practice incorporating a critical race feminist theoretical approach and statistical interactions are also presented. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary {{belonging}} to the thesis entitled ‘Dietary patterns, biomarkers of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality’ The long history of epidemiologic studies on diet and cardiovascular disease (CVD) has traditionally relied on analysis of specific nutrients or foods. Dietary patterns are multiple dietary components operationalized as a single exposure; they reflect the entire diet. In general, two methods are used to define dietary patterns: 1) theoretically, or a priori, defined dietary scores and 2) empirically, or a posteriori, derived dietary patterns. A priori dietary scores were developed to assess diet quality based on adherence to dietary patterns or recommendations. An example of an ‘a posteriori’ approach is factor analysis (e. g. principal components analysis (PCA)). Factor analysis reduces data into patterns based upon intercorrelations between nutrients or foods. The aim of this thesis was to create, examine and compare several dietary patterns and indices and assess these in relation to both early stage markers of CVD (markers of endothelial function and oxidative stress) and to mortality from CVD and all-causes. In chapter 2 we described {{the creation of the}} A Priori Diet Quality Score, representing overall diet quality in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. The CARDIA study included 5115 black and white men and women, aged 18 - 30 at baseline (1985 - 86). Diet was assessed diet at baseline, year 7 (1992 - 93) and 20 (2005 - 06) examinations. The A Priori Diet Quality Score summed 46 food groups rated by investigators as positive or negative on the basis of hypothesized health effects. In 2652 participants with 3 diet assessments, the mean (±SD) A Priori Diet Quality Score increased from 64. 1 ± 13. 0 at year 0 to 71. 1 ± 12. 6 at year 20, which was primarily attributable to increased age. However, the secular trend, which was estimated from differences of dietary quality scores across time at a fixed age (age matched time trend), decreased. The diet score was higher in whites than in blacks and in women than in men and increased with education, but <b>demographic</b> <b>gaps</b> in the score narrowed over 20 y. Consumption of positively rated food groups tended to increase and negatively rated food groups tended to decrease, and were similar in direction across demographic groups. In chapter 3 we used the ‘A Priori Diet Quality Score’ and two dietary patterns derived using principal components analysis (PCA) the ‘Fruit and Vegetables’ dietary pattern and the ‘Meat’ dietary pattern in the CARDIA study. We studied prospective associations of the ‘A Priori Diet Quality Score’, the ‘Fruit and Vegetables’ dietary pattern and the ‘Meat’ dietary pattern with cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs). The ‘Fruit and Vegetables’ dietary pattern was characterized by high intakes of fruit, vegetables, and whole grains and the ‘Meat’ dietary pattern by high intakes of red meat, refined grain, and butter. The ‘A Priori Diet Quality Score’ was related to all CAMs. The ‘Fruit and Vegetables’ dietary pattern was related to E-selectin and sICAM- 1 but not to P-selectin and VCAM. The ‘Meat’ dietary pattern was related to all CAMs except VCAM. Strongest associations were for the ‘Meat’ dietary pattern with E-selectin (effect size 28 % of an SD (+ 3. 9 / 13. 7 ng/mL)) and P-selectin (effect size 37 % of an SD (+ 4. 1 / 11. 2 ng/mL)) and the ‘A Priori Diet Quality Score’ with sICAM- 1 (effect size 34 % of an SD (- 15. 1 / 44. 7 ng/mL)) and VCAM (effect size of 26 % of an SD (- 45. 1 / 170. 3 ng/mL)). Chapter 4 described prospective associations of the A Priori Diet Quality Score, ‘Fruit and Vegetables’ dietary pattern and ‘Meat’ dietary pattern and a plasma biomarker of lipid peroxidation, F 2 -isoprostanes also in the CARDIA study. We estimated associations between each dietary pattern and plasma F 2 -isoprostanes cross-sectionally (at year 20, n= 2736) and prospectively (year 0 / 7 average diet and year 15 / 20 average F 2 -isoprostanes, n= 2718). In the cross-sectional analysis, the A Priori Diet Quality Score and the ‘Fruit and Vegetables’ dietary pattern were inversely, and the ‘Meat’ dietary pattern was positively, associated with F 2 -isoprostanes (all p values < 0. 001). These associations were also statistically significant in prospective analysis. In chapter 5 we described a food classification system derived from the Food-based Dietary Guidelines in the Netherlands {{that can be used to}} systematically and objectively classify foods in relation to their effects on health. Classification criteria for each food group were developed based on presumed positive, neutral or negative effects on chronic diseases of five nutrients: four that likely increase (saturated fatty acids, mono-trans unsaturated fatty acids, sodium, and added sugar) and one that likely decreases (dietary fiber) the risk of chronic diseases. This classification system also provided a framework to create food-based dietary scores for epidemiologic research on diet and chronic disease relationships. Chapter 6 describes the creation of two dietary scores the ‘Dutch Healthy Nutrient and Food Score’ and the ‘Dutch Undesirable Nutrient and Food Score’ based on the food classification system described in chapter 5 in the Alpha Omega Trial. The Alpha Omega Trial is a randomized controlled trial; however the current analyses were done from an observational prospective cohort perspective (with adjustment for intervention groups). We included 4307 cardiac patients aged 60 - 80 years and monitored mortality for 10 years. Patients in the highest quintile of the ‘Dutch Healthy Nutrient and Food Score’ had 30 % (HR 0. 70; 95 % CI 0. 55 - 0. 91) lower CVD and 32 % (HR 0. 68; 95 %CI 0. 47 - 0. 99) lower all-cause mortality risk compared to patients in the first quintile. The ‘Dutch Undesirable Nutrient and Food Score’ was unrelated to both CVD and all-cause mortality. In Chapter 7 we also created a ‘Dutch Healthy Nutrient and Food Score’ and a ‘Dutch Undesirable Nutrient and Food Score’ in the Zutphen Elderly Study. We assessed the association of these scores with 25 year CVD and all-cause mortality and life-years gained. We divided the men (age 65 - 84 years) into those with (n= 210) and without (n= 616) cardiovascular-metabolic diseases at baseline in 1985. During a median follow-up of 10. 6 years (IQR 5. 8 - 15. 9) 806 participants died, of whom 359 from CVD. Diet scores did not predict death in all men. Among men with cardiovascular-metabolic diseases, ‘Dutch Healthy Nutrient and Food Score’ was associated with lower CVD (HR: 0. 57; 95 %CI: 0. 35 - 0. 93) and all-cause mortality risk (HR: 0. 64; 95 % CI: 0. 44 - 0. 94) comparing highest vs. lowest tertiles of the score. Men with cardiovascular-metabolic diseases in the highest vs. lowest tertile of the ‘Dutch Healthy Nutrient and Food Score’ lived 2. 5 year longer. The ‘Dutch Healthy Nutrient and Food Score’ was not associated with CVD and all-cause mortality in men without cardiovascular-metabolic diseases. The ‘Dutch Undesirable Nutrient and Food Score’ was not associated with any of the outcomes. In Chapter 8 we summarized the main findings of this thesis and reflected on some methodological considerations. First, we discussed the different approaches to derive dietary scores and patterns and the advantages and disadvantages of these methods. Second, we reflected on important aspects for creating a priori dietary scores and on further research. Finally, the general conclusions and implications were presented. From the results presented in this thesis we conclude that adherence to a healthy diet is inversely associated with early stage markers of CVD (markers of endothelial function and oxidative stress), CVD and all-cause mortality. In summary, a healthy diet consists of plenty of vegetables and fruit, legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds, moderate intake of fish/poultry/lean meats and low fat dairy, and limited intake of processed meats, refined grains, sugar sweetened beverages, ready meals and snacks. However, this thesis also showed that a high quality dietary pattern can be achieved in several different ways, and may differ among populations.  ...|$|R
40|$|Substantial {{evidence}} exists that economic inequality in Asia has been growing, but {{the dimensions of}} this inequality and its growth are far less clear. This paper evaluates inequality in household incomes per capita across various demographic groups in income surveys from six middle- and high-income countries across Asia: the People's Republic of China (PRC) (2002); India (2004); Japan (2008); Republic of Korea (2006); the Russian Federation (2004, 2007, and 2010); and Taipei,China (2005, 2007, 2010). These surveys, made available by Luxembourg Income Study, are unique {{in that they are}} harmonized across countries and time, cover even Asia's developing countries, and encompass over 130, 000 household records. This study describes patterns in overall inequality, inequality in various quantiles of national income distributions, and income differentials across various <b>demographic</b> groups. Income <b>gaps</b> due to households' rural/urban residence, administrative region, education and employment status, and gender are assessed at various income quantiles using unconditional quantile regressions, and are decomposed into parts due to differentials in household endowments and parts due to differentials in returns to those endowments. Japan; Taipei,China; and Republic of Korea have very low degrees of overall income inequality by world standards, while India and the PRC have high levels. The Russian Federation has a medium degree of inequality, sluggishly improving over time. Rural/urban income gaps are evident across all evaluated countries, but they are particularly high in the PRC, India, and the Russian Federation, accounting for a large share of overall inequality. The rural/urban gap has been falling in the Russian Federation and Taipei,China. Inequality between disadvantaged and advantaged regions is high in the PRC and India, followed by the Taipei,China. Over time this gap stagnated in Taipei,China and further deepened in the Russian Federation, disagreeing with claims of market integration and convergence in recent Russian Federation reports. Education gap is an important component in overall inequality across most countries, especially in the PRC and India. Employment gap is notably large among poor households in the Republic of Korea and Taipei,China, due to differential returns to household endowments, suggesting that non-employed individuals have similar skills as their employed counterparts, but markets and the welfare state do not bestow them with adequate compensation for their skills. Gender gaps are surprisingly small across the six countries - women appear to have a similar distribution of endowments as men, and returns to them are not significantly lower. Polarization arises in the evaluated societies whereby a small group of households come in possession of large stocks of endowments and concentrate in cities and advantaged regions to receive high returns on their endowments. The rest of the populations, notably in India, lack resources to invest in market-valued characteristics to lift themselves up. Overall, education and the return to it, geographic location, and household composition play important roles in driving economic inequality - and suggest viable ways to control it - across demographic groups...|$|R
