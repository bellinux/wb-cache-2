5|$|About {{four stages}} of {{glaciation}} {{have been recognized}} in the area during the Pleistocene, although the glacial history <b>is</b> <b>poorly</b> known. Monte Burney was glaciated during the last glacial maximum. During the early Holocene, glaciers retreated quickly then slowed down during the Antarctic Cold Reversal. A slight expansion is noted during the Little Ice Age.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that boron plays several {{essential}} roles in animals, including humans, but the exact physiological role <b>is</b> <b>poorly</b> understood. A small human trial published in 1987 reported on postmenopausal women first made boron deficient and then repleted with 3 mg/day. Boron supplementation markedly reduced urinary calcium excretion and elevated the serum concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol and testosterone.|$|E

5|$|LACM 149371 (Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County {{specimen}} 149371) is {{an enigmatic}} fossil mammalian tooth from the Paleogene (66 to 23 million years ago, mya) of Peru. It {{is from the}} Santa Rosa fossil site, which is of uncertain age but possibly late Eocene (55 to 34 mya) or Oligocene (34 to 23 mya). The tooth <b>is</b> <b>poorly</b> preserved {{and may have been}} degraded by acidic water or because it passed through a predator's digestive tract. Its largest dimension is 2.65mm. It is triangular in shape and bears six cusps that surround the middle of the tooth, where there are three basins (fossae). Crests connects the cusps and separate the fossae. The microscopic structure of the enamel <b>is</b> <b>poorly</b> preserved.|$|E
5|$|Moult <b>is</b> <b>poorly</b> recorded, {{the only}} records coming from Sakhalin and Himachal Pradesh. In Sakhalin, moult occurs in August and September, between the {{breeding}} season and migration. In Himachal Pradesh, aviculturalist G. A. Perreau observed captive and wild birds {{and reported that}} they were yellow from December to spring and whitish during the remainder of the year, a pattern which may be atypical.|$|E
5|$|Not all ants {{have the}} same kind of societies. The Australian bulldog ants are among the biggest and most basal of ants. Like {{virtually}} all ants, they are eusocial, but their social behaviour <b>is</b> <b>poorly</b> developed compared to other species. Each individual hunts alone, using her large eyes instead of chemical senses to find prey.|$|E

5|$|The {{anatomy of}} 'Pachycephalosaurus' <b>is</b> <b>poorly</b> known, as only skull remains have been described. Pachycephalosaurus {{is famous for}} having a large, bony dome atop its skull, up to 25cm (10in) thick, which safely {{cushioned}} its tiny brain. The dome's rear aspect was edged with bony knobs and short bony spikes projected upwards from the snout. The spikes were probably blunt, not sharp.|$|E
5|$|The diet of many storm petrels species <b>is</b> <b>poorly</b> known {{owing to}} {{difficulties}} in researching; overall {{the family is}} thought to concentrate on crustaceans. Small fish, oil droplets and molluscs are also taken by many species. Some species {{are known to be}} rather more specialised; the grey-backed storm petrel is known to concentrate on the larvae of goose barnacles.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) looks chunky {{and has a}} long condyloid {{process at}} its back; that of T.talamancae is more slender. The capsular process, a projection {{at the back of}} the jaw which houses the root of the lower incisor, <b>is</b> <b>poorly</b> developed.|$|E

5|$|The {{oxidation}} {{states of}} ruthenium range from 0 to +8, and −2. The properties of ruthenium and osmium compounds are often similar. The +2, +3, and +4 states {{are the most}} common.

5|$|The planet e's {{eccentricity}} <b>is</b> <b>poorly</b> defined; varying values between 0 and 0.4 {{does not}} significantly improve the fit, so an eccentricity of 0.2 was assumed. Taking {{interactions between the}} planets into account results in a near-zero orbital eccentricity.|$|E

5|$|The sperm whale's {{cerebrum}} is {{the largest}} in all mammalia, both in absolute and relative terms. The olfactory system is reduced, suggesting that the sperm whale has a poor sense of taste and smell. By contrast, the auditory system is enlarged. The pyramidal tract <b>is</b> <b>poorly</b> developed, reflecting the reduction of its limbs.|$|E

5|$|Adaptations {{to night}} vision include the large {{size of the}} eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cone cells, since rod cells have {{superior}} light sensitivity. There are few coloured oil drops, which would reduce the light intensity. Unlike diurnal birds of prey, owls normally have only one fovea, and that <b>is</b> <b>poorly</b> developed except in daytime hunters like the short-eared owl.|$|E

The Perijá tapaculo is a secretive bird and therefore difficult to observe; {{as a result}} its ecology <b>is</b> <b>poorly</b> known. It feeds on insects and reproduces between April and July.

There is no major local government employment in the town, and the principal public sector employers are the Primary Care Trust and the schools.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{operation}} may have commenced under Septimius Zabbai, Zabdas' second-in-command, {{the invasion of}} Asia Minor did not fully begin until Zabdas' arrival {{in the spring of}} 271. The Palmyrenes annexed Galatia and, according to Zosimus, reached Ancyra. Bithynia and the Cyzicus mint remained beyond Zenobia's control, and her attempts to subdue Chalcedon failed. The Asia Minor campaign <b>is</b> <b>poorly</b> documented, but {{the western part of the}} region did not become part of the queen's authority; no coins with Zenobia or Vaballathus' portraits were minted in Asia Minor, and no royal Palmyrene inscriptions have been found. By August 271 Zabdas was back in Palmyra, with the Palmyrene empire at its zenith.|$|E
