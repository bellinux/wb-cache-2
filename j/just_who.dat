[...] Jim Farber from the New York Daily News commented that [...] "'Heavy Crown' has a tribal rock beat and a cocky cameo vocal from Ellie Goulding", {{and went on to}} analyse the lyrics, referring to Azalea's dispute with Snoop Dogg, [...] "one new verse from Iggy addresses a recent, and light-hearted, beef. 'Get rid of the makeup/let’s be <b>just</b> <b>who</b> you is,' Azalea raps at one point, alluding to a series of tit-for-tat spats in October with Snoop Dogg.".

[...] Pratchett responded to this criticism in an open letter, where he noted that he had only described Twoflower as [...] "exotically foreign" [...] until Interesting Times.

The song, which is cited as being a pop song, has a moderately slow tempo of 90 beats per minute. Instruments used include a piano and guitar. Jon Pareles stated that Jackson was calling himself [...] "a victim of police brutality" [...] and a [...] "victim of hate". He continued, [...] "A listener might wonder <b>just</b> <b>who</b> 'Us' is supposed to be...

500|$|Wrigley's {{promotion}} to acting {{air vice marshal}} was announced in May 1941, making him only the third member of the RAAF—after Richard Williams and Stanley Goble—to attain this rank.

Williams, who commanded Overseas Headquarters at its inception in December 1941, with McNamara as his deputy, had subsequently been appointed as the RAAF's representative to Washington, DC, leaving McNamara in charge of the London office until Wrigley arrived. The Minister for Air, Arthur Drakeford, was in favour of Williams commanding the RAAF offices in both the US and UK while Wrigley acted for him in London, despite Wrigley having been appointed AOC. [...] Wrigley's diary recorded that when Williams returned to London in October 1942 to attend a conference, he began [...] "throwing his weight around" [...] and [...] "intriguing to have himself made AOC, and possibly AOCinC [...] of all RAAF units and personnel outside Australia and the SW Pacific". Although Williams departed England in January 1943, the matter was only fully laid to rest in mid-1943, when the CAS, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, advised Williams that it was impractical for him to command offices in both Washington and London.|$|E
