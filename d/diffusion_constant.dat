40|$|International audienceA {{method for}} quantitatively calculating nuclear spin <b>diffusion</b> <b>constants</b> {{directly}} from crystal structures is introduced. This approach uses the first-principles low-order correlations in Liouville space (LCL) method to simulate spin diffusion in a box, starting from atomic geometry and including both magic-angle spinning (MAS) and powder averaging.
