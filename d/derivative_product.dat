2500|$|The 2600 {{range was}} {{replaced}} {{at the top}} of the Alfa range by the 1750 models in 1968. [...] The 1750s were refined versions of the 1600 cc Giulia range which continued in production, so once more the Alfa Romeo flagship was a <b>derivative</b> <b>product</b> created by upgrading the motor of an existing range and carrying out a minor restyling. All similarity with the 2600 ends there though; the 1750s, and the 2000s which evolved from them, were a great success for Alfa Romeo from every point of view, especially sales.|$|E
2500|$|A typical {{problem for}} a numerically {{oriented}} quantitative analyst would be to develop a model for pricing, hedging, and risk-managing a complex <b>derivative</b> <b>product.</b> Mathematically oriented quantitative analysts {{tend to have more}} of a reliance on numerical analysis, and less of a reliance on statistics and econometrics. These quantitative analysts tend to be of the psychology that prefers a deterministically [...] "correct" [...] answer, as once there is agreement on input values and market variable dynamics, there is only one correct price for any given security (which can be demonstrated, albeit often inefficiently, through a large volume of Monte Carlo simulations).|$|E
2500|$|In finance, a futures {{contract}} (more colloquially, futures) is a standardized forward contract, a legal agreement {{to buy or}} sell [...] something at a predetermined price at a specified time [...] in the future. The asset transacted is usually a commodity or financial instrument and the transaction is usually done on the trading floor of a futures exchange. [...] The predetermined price the parties agree to buy and sell the asset for [...] is known as the forward price. The specified time in the future -- which is when delivery and payment occur -- is known as the delivery date. Because it is a function of an underlying asset, a {{futures contract}} is a <b>derivative</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E
40|$|ArticleThis paper empirically {{analyzes}} factors behind successful <b>derivatives</b> <b>products</b> in {{the emerging}} markets of the Asian region. Successful <b>derivatives</b> <b>products</b> are defined as contracts with high trade volume. The influencing factors are {{the size of the}} underlying spot market, the spot market volatility, the spot market liquidity, whether the <b>derivatives</b> <b>product</b> was the first contract introduced in the derivatives exchange, and whether the product was options or futures. We find that the size of the underlying spot market, the spot market volatility and the spot market liquidity have statistically significantly positive effect on the trading volume of the <b>derivatives</b> <b>products.</b> Moreover, if the <b>derivatives</b> <b>product</b> was the first <b>derivatives</b> <b>product</b> introduced in the exchange, it {{is more likely to be}} successful. Option contracts are relatively more successful than their respective futures contracts in terms of trading volume, which could be due to the costs associated with margin requirements.

40|$|The {{modelling}} of {{default risk}} in debt securities involves making {{assumptions about the}} stochastic process driv- ing default, the process generating the write-down in default, and risk-free interest rates. Three generic approaches have been used. The first relies on modelling {{the value of the}} assets on which the debt is written. The second involves modelling default as an arrival process. The third involves directly modelling the interest rate spreads to which default gives rise. Each of these approaches may be applied to the impact of default risk on <b>derivative</b> <b>products</b> such as swaps and options. One application is to the valuation of <b>derivative</b> <b>products</b> that may default. The other is to the new class of 'credit derivatives' that represent <b>derivative</b> <b>products</b> written on credit risk. default risk, credit risk, risky debt, <b>derivative</b> <b>products,...</b>|$|R
