5|$|After trucks {{became popular}} in the 1910s, the Omaha Stockyards grew exponentially. Cattle, hogs and sheep were shipped cheaper by truck than by trains. In 1919 27% of {{livestock}} at the Stockyards was shipped by truck; by 1940's it rose to over 75%. In 1955 the Stockyards became the biggest livestock <b>distribution</b> <b>center</b> in the United States, {{and almost all of}} the cattle was shipped by truck.|$|E

5|$|Between 1870 and 1920, the {{population}} of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold. Many of the new residents were immigrants who sought employment in the factories and mills and introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city. Ethnic neighborhoods emerged on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as South Side, Polish Hill, Bloomfield, and Squirrel Hill, home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households. The Strip District, the city's produce <b>distribution</b> <b>center,</b> still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers.|$|E

5|$|From {{its heyday}} of the 1850s until the Great Depression in the 1930s, Jeffersonville was the leading center of U.S. {{steamboat}} production, due largely to its excellent harbor, which remained the deepest in the surrounding area. Many individuals {{who lived in the}} district worked at the Howard Shipyards, that became Jeffboat in the nearby town of Port Fulton, which was eventually annexed into Jeffersonville. The town gained its first railroad in 1852, connecting to Columbus, Indiana, and {{with the opening of the}} Fourteenth Street Bridge in 1870, became a railroad center. The city became an important <b>distribution</b> <b>center</b> during the Civil War for the Union Army, because three railroads connected to Jeffersonville and because the Ohio River served as a defensive barrier against invasion from Confederate attack, it was deemed a safer location than the more vulnerable city of Louisville, Kentucky located on the southern side of the river.|$|E
5|$|Grand Forks International Airport (GFK, KGFK) {{is served}} by Delta Air Lines with several daily round trips to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport; and Allegiant Air, which {{operates}} flights {{a few times a}} week to Mesa, Arizona (Phoenix-Gateway), Sanford, Florida (Orlando-Sanford) and Las Vegas, Nevada.

The airport was a major <b>distribution</b> <b>center</b> for FedEx, which conducts flights daily within the state and northern Minnesota. FedEx moved their flight operations to Fargo, ND on October 31, 2016. The airport is one of the busiest airports in the country, due in large measure to the presence of the John D.

5|$|Power outages were {{reported}} throughout Central and North Florida, with over 93,300customers losing electricity, including about 9,500power outages between Tampa and Temple Terrace. In several counties, such as Alachua, Bradford, Duval, Flagler, Hardee, Martin, Orange, Putnam, and St. Lucie, impact was primarily limited to falling trees, which blocked roads, knocked down some power lines, or left generally minor damage to homes and vehicles. A few tornadoes and waterspouts were spawned during a storm. A waterspout was spotted offshore Lee County near Bonita Springs and Estero. An EF1 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita scale touched down near Jacksonville. The tornado snapped {{a number of}} pine and hardwood trees, while causing roof damage to some homes. At a Publix <b>distribution</b> <b>center,</b> three empty trucks were overturned. A possible tornado in Alachua County {{in the vicinity of}} Hawthorne toppled some trees and damaged a home.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a coordinated location-inventory model under uncertain {{demands for a}} closed loop supply chain comprising of one plant, forward and reverse <b>distribution</b> <b>centers,</b> and retailers. The inventory of new and returned products is managed at forward and reverse <b>distribution</b> <b>centers</b> respectively through a periodic review policy. The proposed model determines the location of forward and reverse <b>distribution</b> <b>centers</b> and the associated capacities, the review intervals of the inventory policy at <b>distribution</b> <b>centers,</b> and the assignments of retailers to the <b>distribution</b> <b>centers.</b> We model six different coordination strategies. All the models are formulated as nonlinear integer programs with chance constraints and transformed to conic quadratic mixed-integer programs that can be efficiently solved by CPLEX. An outer approximation based solution algorithm is developed to solve the conic quadratic mixed-integer program. The benefit {{of different types of}} coordination strategies is shown through extensive computational testing...|$|R
5|$|The tornado {{crossed the}} Trinity River and dealt F1or greater damage to {{over a hundred}} homes in the {{adjacent}} subdivision. Some roofs sustained partial roof loss and many large trees either lost limbs or were toppled. At the intersection of West Sixth Street and University Drive, the tornado abruptly turned east from its initial southeast heading, bringing it over the Linwood subdivision at around 6:22p.m. CST (00:22UTC). The homes in the neighborhood were mostly small, wood-framed structures on pier or beam foundations, making them highly vulnerable to the tornadic winds and resulting in widespread structural failure. A {{survey conducted by the}} Wind Damage and Engineering Program at Texas Tech University later concluded that many of the buildings that suffered total structural failure did so due to structural deficiencies rather than the strong winds associated with the tornado. The tornado then passed over a Montgomery Ward <b>distribution</b> <b>center,</b> causing roof damage to the complex and overturning numerous parked trucks; one person was killed while trying to reach shelter after a truck fell on them. Another person was killed after being struck by a collapsing brick wall. Together, these two fatalities represented the only deaths associated with the Fort Worth tornado and the overall tornado outbreak. Several nearby metal buildings were toppled before the tornado once again crossed the Trinity River, entering Fort Worth's central business district.|$|E
