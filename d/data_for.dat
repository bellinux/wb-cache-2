Reducing the mulliken charge of center atom at position X which connects the triazine ring with B ring can augment the inhibition activity of <b>DATAs</b> <b>for</b> mutant-type L 100 I, K 103 N HIV- 1 RT.

5|$|Falling {{electricity}} production may be boosted through drilling additional supply boreholes, as at Poihipi and Ohaaki. The Wairakei power station {{has been running}} much longer, with its first unit commissioned in November 1958, and it attained its peak generation of 173MW in 1965, but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering, in 1982 being derated to intermediate pressure and the station managing 157MW. Around {{the start of the}} 21st century it was managing about 150MW, then in 2005 two 8MW isopentane systems were added, boosting the station's output by about 14MW. Detailed data are unavailable, being lost due to re-organisations. One such re-organisation in 1996 causes the absence of early <b>data</b> <b>for</b> Poihipi (started 1996), and the gap in 1996/7 for Wairakei and Ohaaki; half-hourly <b>data</b> <b>for</b> Ohaaki's first few months of operation are also missing, as well as for most of Wairakei's history.|$|E

5|$|Perl's text-handling {{capabilities}} can be {{used for}} generating SQL queries; arrays, hashes, and automatic memory management make it easy to collect and process the returned <b>data.</b> <b>For</b> example, in Tim Bunce's Perl DBI application programming interface (API), the arguments to the API can be the text of SQL queries; thus it is possible to program in multiple languages at the same time (e.g., for generating a Web page using HTML, JavaScript, and SQL in a here document). The use of Perl variable interpolation to programmatically customize each of the SQL queries, and the specification of Perl arrays or hashes as the structures to programmatically hold the resulting data sets from each SQL query, allows a high-level mechanism for handling large amounts of <b>data</b> <b>for</b> post-processing by a Perl subprogram.|$|E
