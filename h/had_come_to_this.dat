25|$|Radovich {{had to take}} jobs {{outside of}} {{professional}} football. One was waiting tables at Los Angeles's Brown Derby restaurant. There he met Joseph Alioto, a former antitrust litigator with the Justice Department. In conversation, he told Alioto how he <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> and Alioto responded by sketching out a legal brief {{on the back of}} a cocktail napkin.|$|E
25|$|After the {{collapse}} of Portuguese rule in Mozambique in 1974â€“75, {{it was no longer}} viable for the Smith regime to sustain white minority rule indefinitely. By this time, even South Africa's Vorster <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> view. While Vorster was unwilling to make concessions to his own country's blacks, he concluded that white minority rule was not sustainable in a country where blacks outnumbered whites 22:1. In 1978, there were 270,000 Rhodesians of European descent and more than six million Africans.|$|E
500|$|In 2013 Senholt {{noted that}} because the group has no {{official}} membership, it is [...] "difficult, if not impossible, to estimate the number of ONA members". Senholt suggested that a [...] "rough estimate" [...] of the [...] "total number" [...] of individuals involved with the ONA in some capacity from 1980 to 2009 was [...] "a few thousand"; he <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> conclusion from {{an examination of the}} number of magazines and journals about the subject circulated and the number of members of online discussion groups devoted to the ONA. At the same time he thought that the number of [...] "longtime adherents is much smaller." [...] Also in 2013, Monette estimated that there were over two thousand ONA associates, broadly defined. He believed that the gender balance was roughly equal, although with regional variation and differences among particular nexions. Introvigne noted that if Monette's estimate was correct, it would mean that the ONA is [...] "easily... the largest Satanist organization in the world".|$|E

2500|$|After {{finishing}} {{and releasing}} his magnum opus Naan Kadavul in February 2009, Bala, whose previous feature films {{had all been}} tragedy drama films dealing with serious and dark subjects, announced that for his next directorial, he would be moving away from such films and make a full-length light-hearted comedy film. He was working on its script in the following months, whilst declaring {{that it will be}} a double hero subject. Allegedly Bala <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> decision, since his earlier films, despite receiving critical acclaim, garnered poor or only average box office returns. During the post-production phase, Bala disclosed that the film was [...] "fun till the last 15 minutes, after which it turns serious", adding that he decided to [...] "change tracks", after several people including his mentor Balu Mahendra advised him to do so.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{pleasure}} {{is on our}} side too; but the wonder would have been, if you <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> house without hearing of Mr. Deronda--wouldn't it, Mirah?" [...] said Mrs. Meyrick.|$|E
60|$|So it <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> {{after our}} romantic solitary voyage! We were to end {{as a common}} carrier, after all. One is born a demigod, the French say, to die a grocer.|$|E
60|$|He <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{conclusion}} for {{the fiftieth}} time, {{when the door}} opened, and his creditor appeared in person. To Spennie, he looked like the embodiment of Fate, a sort of male Nemesis.|$|E

6000|$|WE added several {{passengers}} to our list, at La Crosse; among others an old gentleman who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> north-western region {{with the early}} settlers, and was familiar with every part of it. Pardonably proud of it, too. He said-- ...|$|E

60|$|Angel's {{original}} intention had {{not been}} emigration to Brazil but a northern or eastern farm in his own country.

60|$|It {{was opened}} {{by an old}} man, whom I {{believed}} I had seen more than once since we <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> village of York in converse {{with some of the}} red-coated officers, and even then I strove to pull Pierre back that we might make our escape in the darkness.|$|E

6000|$|Another thing {{influenced}} her: {{a reflection}} {{that had not}} been absent from her mind since the Weldons departed for the day and had left her practically in charge of the house.
