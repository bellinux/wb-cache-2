5|$|The {{most common}} type of Mycenaean helmet is the conical one {{reinforced}} with rows of boar tusks. This type was widely used and became the most identifiable piece of Mycenaean armor, being in use <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> the collapse of Mycenaean culture. It is also known from several depictions in contemporary art in Greece and the Mediterranean. Boar's tusk helmets consisted of a felt-lined leather cap, with several rows of cut boar's tusk sewn onto it.|$|E
5|$|The player, as Yumetaro, must {{venture into}} the {{alternate}} dimension to rescue his new owner. The player character can jump and spawn stars above the horn on his head. The star is a central mechanic to the game, being necessary to defeat enemies found while also doubling as a platform, capable of being ridden to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. The player must make their way through six stages and six bosses to complete the game. Once the sixth boss is defeated, it is revealed that the girl is still missing and the game restarts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning.</b> <b>To</b> truly complete Gimmick!, the player must find a hidden area in each stage where a magic item resides. If one can obtain each all the magic items without losing every life (i.e. using no continues), a secret stage will appear in which an extra boss must be beaten. Only after this boss is defeated is the game completed in full, with a cutscene showing Yumetaro rescuing the girl and leading {{her back to the}} real world.|$|E

25|$|The daggernose shark is viviparous; {{once the}} {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is {{converted into a}} placental connection through which the mother delivers sustenance. Females give birth to litters of 2–8 pups every other year, following a year-long gestation period. There is no correlation between female size and number of offspring. Mating and parturition take place over a roughly six-month period <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> {{the end of the}} rainy season. However, the daggernose shark is capable of shifting the timing of its reproductive cycle by at least four months, possibly in response to varying environmental conditions. Females move into shallow coastal nurseries to give birth; one important nursery exists off Brazilian state of Maranhão.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the close}} of the UWFi, Nobuhiko Takada, the most popular of the UWFi workers amongst the {{mainstream}} public founded Kingdom Pro Wrestling, taking in Sakuraba and the majority of his fellow UWFi alumni. In the vein of its predecessor, Kingdom was primarily a league devoted to shoot-style realistic-looking works. Having by now established his ability, Sakuraba was this time booked as a main-eventer from the outset. However, unlike the UWFi, Kingdom struggled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> draw substantial crowds. Mixed martial arts was growing in popularity, and the dominance of the Gracie family and their fellow Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners over the field and more specifically over professional wrestlers, left the Japanese public ever more unconvinced as to the fighting ability of Kingdom's stable of athletes.|$|E
25|$|He then {{acted as}} a {{minister}} at Ware, Stowmarket and Beaconsfield. At Ware {{the teachings of the}} French philosophers were brought before him by a friend, Joseph Fawcett, who held strong republican opinions. Godwin came to London in 1782, still nominally as a minister, to regenerate society with his pen – a real enthusiast, who shrank theoretically from no conclusions from the premises which he laid down. He adopted the principles of the Encyclopédistes, and his own aim was the complete overthrow of all existing political, social and religious institutions. He believed, however, that calm discussion was the only thing needful to carry every change, and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> {{the end of his career}} he deprecated every approach to violence. He was a philosophic radical in the strictest sense of the term.|$|E

25|$|At mealtimes {{very dry}} wines with little {{minerals}} are recommended with oysters and seafood: their acidity reveals the salinity of the shellfish. The most fragrant wines go well with shellfish, fish, or poached white meat. For stews the acidity {{of white wine}} counterbalances the weight of fat. If the sauce is well balanced with an intense ingredient (lemon juice or mustard) a more opulent wine can be recommended: sweet or dry wine aged in barrels. Sweet wines either just sweet or fortified are a good option for exotic dishes with sweet spices (dishes with cinnamon, vanilla etc.). Fortified white wines are recommended with foie gras. Sparkling wines can be taken {{at any time during}} the meal, their diversity allows this. A choice of sparkling wine also allows the retention of the same wine <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> the end of the meal.|$|E
25|$|Amongst other minor theorems here {{given it}} may suffice {{to mention the}} {{proposition}} that the kinetic energy imparted by the given impulses to a material system under given constraints is a maximum, and the principle of least action. All the analysis is so elegant that Sir William Rowan Hamilton said the work could be described only as a scientific poem. Lagrange remarked that mechanics was really a branch of pure mathematics analogous to a geometry of four dimensions, namely, the time and the three coordinates of the point in space; and it is said that he prided himself that <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> the end of the work {{there was not a single}} diagram. At first no printer could be found who would publish the book; but Legendre at last persuaded a Paris firm to undertake it, and it was issued under the supervision of Laplace, Cousin, Legendre (editor) and Condorcet in 1788.|$|E
25|$|Lèse-majesté {{complaints}} can {{be filed}} by any person against anyone else, {{and they must}} always be formally investigated. Details of the charges are rarely made public. A section 112 defendant always meets with obstructions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> {{the end of a}} case, especially when asking for a provisional release. There are months-long pretrial detentions, and those who are charged are routinely denied bail, remaining in prison for many months awaiting trial. In most cases, convictions result in harsh sentences. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention determined in August 2012 that the pretrial detention of an alleged lèse-majesté offender violated international human rights law. The courts seem not to recognise the principle of granting {{the benefit of the doubt}} to defendants. Judges have said that accusers did not have to prove the factuality of the alleged lèse-majesté material, but only to claim it is defaming in any way. Pleading guilty is seen as a move to seek a royal pardon.|$|E
