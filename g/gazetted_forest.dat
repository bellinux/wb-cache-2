However, Indonesia faces one of the highest rates of forest loss in the world. Deforestation and forest degradation accounts for more than 60 per cent of carbon emissions in Indonesia. Being aware of that fact and the danger of climate change, in October 2009, Indonesia voluntarily committed to reduce emissions by 26 per cent from business as usual by 2020 through national efforts, and by 41 per cent with international support. Indonesia’s commitment has gained international support; chiefly from Norway, which signed a Letter of Intent on 26 May 2010. To formalise the commitment, Presidential Decree No 19 / 2010 on Task Force for the preparation of REDD+ Agency and Presidential Instruction No 10 / 2011 on moratorium on new licenses and improvement of natural primary forest and peat land governance have been issued.

40|$|It is now {{recognized}} that addressing deforestation and forest and peatlands degradation and destruction in Indonesia requires improvements {{to land and}} forest governance. It is also accepted that further research is required into this large field of study and practice. In particular needs have been identified for better links between theory and practice, and between academic analysis {{and work in the}} field. To respond to this gap, this study investigates the underlying drivers of deforestation, and forest and peatlands degradation and destruction (herein called deforestation and peatlands degradation) with the intention of identifying interventions that will improve land and forest governance in Indonesia. Through a Delphi process, a panel of experts on forest and land governance identified three main drivers of deforestation and peatlands degradation. These were: (1) unclear land tenure and uncertain land classification (agreed by 88 % of respondents); (2) business and political interests that influence policy-making and regulations (70 % agreement) and (3) ineffective land use planning (53 % agreement). In response, the panel recommended three priority governance interventions relating to the following issues: (1) increasing the capacity of local communities to manage and monitor forests and natural resources (65 % agreement); (2) <b>gazetting</b> <b>forests</b> to clarify land boundaries and determine which areas should be village, community and state forest zone (58 % agreement); (3) integrating participatory maps into spatial plans to protect local communities and indigenous peoples' development needs (53 % agreement). A research theme with the highest agreement was the following: action research involving the government, private sector and community (64 % agreement). This study finds that there is strong support for community level approaches to forest management. Securing community forest tenure through clarifying land claims and integrating local land tenure into spatial planning is a key step to achieving sustainable forest management. The concluding recommendations suggest that the most efficacious interventions to be taken by researchers, government, donors and civil society to improve Indonesia's forest and land governance processes include: Support community institutions; Accelerate forest gazettement using local community institutions to clarify community forest claims; Integrate participatory maps into spatial plans; Support local communities' ability to monitor forests; Conduct action research involving all stakeholders; Address financing of the forest and land sector; Engage political economy analysis...|$|R
40|$|Deforestation {{and land}} use change are {{widespread}} in western Uganda. However, the spatial patterns and time-series of change and the reasons why it is occurring remain to be fully investigated. In this work a combination of satellite imagery and social surveys is used to quantify forest gains and loss {{over the last three}} decades in the region close to Lake Albert, whilst also providing an account of possible drivers of change. This area proves to be interesting as it covers regions with both formally protected areas (gazetted regions) and un-protected forest, the latter being largely under private ownership. Remote sensing data from the Landsat satellites were gathered for forest change detection, and were processed using standard remote sensing techniques, then quantified using GIS and regression methods. Fieldwork allowed these data to be ground truthed while gathering (quantitative) household surveys and (qualitative) key informant interviews. Quantitative surveys were analysed using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis, and were compared qualitatively with the satellite analysis and stakeholder interviews. The results show that forest cover declined significantly outside gazetted areas at the expense of varying local–scale processes, although the protection of the <b>gazetted</b> <b>forests</b> was remarkably successful. In <b>forest</b> corridors outside <b>gazetted</b> regions, losses exceeded 90 % (p< 0. 05). Survey data suggest that rural poor households {{were more likely to be}} situated in forested regions, and were more dependent on forest resources for their livelihoods. However, the drivers of change were spatially variable, with expansion of sugarcane farming being a likely driver in the northern areas, but small–scale agricultural expansion a significant factor in the more southern parts of the study region. While there is wide agreement within the data that the patterns of forest cover {{and land use}} changes are anthropogenically driven, more specific drivers are swamped by intricacies of the bio-physical and socio-economic preconditions that are inseparable in both space and time, although agricultural expansion and population growth were evident and pervasive. The analyses provide insights into complex anthropogenic processes at various spatial scales, and policy recommendations provided are widely applicable for developing countries struggling to conserve nature whilst boosting economic growth.

40|$|Multiple-use forest {{management}} {{is considered by}} many as a preferable alternative to single-use, generally timber-dominant, management models.

In this paper we briefly explore the major land-uses in the Congo Basin and their actual or potential for multiple-use. We then focus on the most extant production system (industrial logging concessions) and analyze the existing issues and options for managing actively both timber and biodiversity with a special emphasis on wildlife and the role of certification. A few promising but yet ‘unfinished’ examples do exist in the region and we review these cases to draw lessons and recommendations. We contend however that true multiple-use could only be realized by expanding beyond boundaries of formal management units through new innovative land-use units, allowing a spatial cohabitation of the interests of local people, of conservation proponents and of extractive industries in the same management unit...|$|E
40|$|This Bachelor Thesis {{investigates the}} {{inherent}} conflict of preservation and livelihood, {{and what can}} be done to avoid this problem. The purpose of the study is to investigate if there is an enhanced risk of overexploitation in areas in proximity to forest reserves. This assumption is based on the fact that people living in close contact with nature are directly dependent on ecosystem-services for maintaining their livelihood. Hence, preservation of an area could result in degradation, if unprotected areas will have to sustain more people with, for example, firewood and pastoral land. Based on a field study in Babati District, Northern Tanzania, I have seen signs that imply that preservation of Ufiome, the forest covering Mt Kwaraa, has had effects on areas in proximity to the <b>gazetted</b> <b>forest.</b> The method used to conduct this study was semi-structured interviews with local farmers living in closeness to Ufiome NR, but also with district officials. Finally, I think that the solution to many of the problems that come with preservation are possible to handle by the use of Participatory Forest Management (PFM); Joint Forest Management (JFM) and Community Based Forest Management (CBFM). The key to coming to terms with conservational problems lies on scale-related solutions that focuses on implementing management of natural resources on a local level, claiming that fine-scale ecological issues are best dealt with on fine-scale social levels...|$|E
40|$|As {{community}} involvement in natural forest management expands and matures, {{the need to}} lodge the rights and obligations of both state and community in workable and legally binding institutional frameworks becomes more pressing. This is particularly so where power and authority are being redistributed. This publication looks specifically at Tanzania, where forest-local communities are beginning to be designated as the management authority of particular woodlands and, in some cases, even their owners. Positive results are giving considerable support to community-based management as the forest management strategy of choice. Implementation has of necessity also prompted a search for accessible mechanisms through which community authority may be embedded legally. The author argues that, in this respect, Tanzania has an advantage over many sub-Saharan African states in the unusual manner of legal identity granted to rural communities, and in supporting administrative and land laws which provide for village-based control over natural resource management. Specific elements explored include the fact that rural villages in Tanzania are recognised as a formal level of government, endowed thereby with certain rights and obligations; that the rural village may attain legal corporate status allowing it, inter alia, to own and manage property in ways accountable {{in a court of}} law; and that property law provides for a modern, statutory version of communal tenure, within the bounds and accountability of a private legal person.

The results are based firstly, on secondary research and the examination of relevant literature on traditional and conventional forest management approaches and forest legislation and its bearing on these approaches. Secondly, the results reflect on the findings of a primary research based on Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) workshops conducted in five villages abutting Fuller forest, using six different PRA tools. During the pre-colonial era the current demarcated forests were managed as common property under the guidance of traditional institutions. Rights accrued to specified user groups. Non-members were excluded. Rules defined the rights and duties of members with regards to access, use and management. Sanctions were in place to ensure compliance. The management practices ensured sustainable <b>forest</b> conservation.

40|$|Abstract: According to {{the results}} {{from a number of}} palaeoecology-based studies, montane forest appears to have been present across a broad range of altitudes in western Uganda {{throughout}} much of the Holocene (before increased levels of human impact over the past 2000 years or so resulted in extensive clearance). Critically for pollen-based studies of vegetation history, clearance has limited investigations into the late-Holocene history of montane forest, and thus the impact of small amplitude, sub-Milankovich variations in climate and low levels of human activity. Mubwindi Swamp in the Rukiga Highlands of southwest Uganda is today surrounded by dense stands of moist lower montane forest. The uppermost 5 m of organic-rich deposits from Mubwindi Swamp are dated to the last 2100 years, and thus provide an opportunity, so far unique for Uganda, to record variations in the composition of lower montane forest during the late Holocene. Results of analyses of pollen indicate that lower montane forest has been present in the catchment for Mubwindi Swamp throughout the last 2100 years. A transition to a more open, and possibly drier, form of forest is apparent from around 710 BP. It seems likely that this transition was at least partly driven by climate. There is an increased occurrence of pollen from plants presently associated with areas of degraded forest from around 200 BP and a decrease in pollen from important sources of timber. These changes could be interpreted as representing slightly increased humidity. However, in view of the nature of these changes, a low level of human impact was probably the most important causal factor. The <b>gazetting</b> of Bwindi-Impenetrable <b>Forest</b> as a Forest Reserve in the early 1930 s may have facilitated a recovery of timber trees during the present century...|$|R
