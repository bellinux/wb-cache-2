5000|$|In geology or geography, {{the word}} [...] "{{quadrangle}}" [...] usually {{refers to a}} United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute quadrangle map, which are usually named after a local physiographic feature. The shorthand [...] "quad" [...] is also used, especially {{with the name of}} the map; for example, [...] "the Ranger Creek, Texas quad map". These maps are one-quarter of the older 15-minute series. On a quadrangle map, the north and south limits of the quadrangle are not straight lines, but are actually curved to match <b>Earth's</b> <b>lines</b> of latitude on the standard projection. The east and west limits are usually not parallel as they match <b>Earth's</b> <b>lines</b> of longitude. In the United States, a 7.5 minute quadrangle map covers an area of 49 to 70 sq mi.|$|R
40|$|WO 2008125341 A 1 UPAB: 20081112 NOVELTY - The {{isolator}} has an <b>earth</b> <b>line</b> and {{a capacitor}} (c) {{arranged in a}} signal conducting line. The dimensions of the lines are designed such that the conducting line shields an electric field of propagated changing direct current voltage signals to provide an area on an upper surface of the conducting line. The amplitude of electric field strength of the voltage signals {{is lower than the}} amplitude of electric field strength of direct current voltage signals entering an upper surface of the <b>earth</b> <b>line,</b> in the area. The capacitor is arranged in the shielded area of the conducting line. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for isolation of direct current voltage and alternating current voltage components of signals. USE - Direct current voltage isolator for use in an amplifier for amplifying direct current or high frequency signals, and in a measuring technique (all claimed) that is used for measuring scattering parameters. ADVANTAGE - The isolator is designed such that the direct current voltage supply is provided with enlarged bandwidth, higher cut-off frequency and enhanced maximum direct current (DC) current flow. The isolator prevents a direct galvanic current flow between the signal-conducting <b>lines</b> and the <b>earth</b> <b>line...</b>|$|R
50|$|Sally Line {{was founded}} in 1981 by Michael Kingshott as a {{subsidiary}} of the Finland-based Rederi Ab Sally, and initially marketed as Sally Viking Line, with a livery that was nearly identical with that of Viking Line, a Baltic Sea ferry consortium that Sally was a member of. The naming scheme of Sally's Viking Line ships was also carried over to the UK operations, with ships named either The Viking or Viking number. In 1987 Rederi Ab Sally, including the Sally <b>Line</b> <b>UK</b> operations, was sold to Effoa and Johnson Line, Sally's Baltic Sea rivals and owners of Silja Line. As a result of the change of ownership, a new Sally <b>Line</b> <b>UK</b> livery was adopted in 1988 and the company's ships were renamed with a Sally-prefix. Sally <b>Line</b> <b>UK</b> operated the Holyman Sally Line service from Port of Ramsgate to Ostend from 1993 to 1998, but this became no longer viable Holyman became partners with Hoverspeed and moved the service to Dover. In the mid-90s Sally Line adapted a new livery and a logo similar to that of Silja Line, but this proved short-lived as the company ceased operations in 1998.|$|R

This {{corresponds to a}} motion transverse to <b>Earth's</b> <b>line</b> of sight of 79 km/s. Observations at Yerkes Observatory had measured its radial velocity as 62 km/s.

50|$|All known planets transit the star; {{this means}} that all five planets' orbits appear to cross {{in front of their}} star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations {{relative}} to <b>Earth's</b> <b>line</b> of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight they are, vary by less than one degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star.|$|R

Not all figures have a unique reversion: the figures that are neither {{entering}} nor exiting revert into themselves, and the other figures with even points revert into their inverted figure. Reversion often represents an axial polarity, such as {{the male and female}} axis between Puer and Puella.|$|R
