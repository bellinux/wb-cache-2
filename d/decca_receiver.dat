5000|$|<b>Decca</b> <b>receivers</b> multiplied {{the signals}} {{received}} from the Master and each Slave by different values {{to arrive at a}} common frequency (least common multiple, LCM) for each Master/Slave pair, as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|Early <b>Decca</b> <b>receivers</b> were {{fitted with}} three {{rotating}} Decometers that indicated the phase difference for each pattern. Each Decometer drove a second indicator that counted {{the number of}} lanes traversed [...] - [...] each 360 degrees of phase difference was one lane traversed. In this way, assuming the point of departure was known, {{a more or less}} distinct location could be identified.|$|R
50|$|This chain {{installation}} {{was considered}} highly controversial at the time, for political reasons. This {{led to the}} U.S. Coast Guard, under instructions from the Treasury Department to which it reported, banning the use of <b>Decca</b> <b>receivers</b> in ships entering New York harbour for fear that the system might create a de facto standard (as it had become {{in other areas of}} the world). It also served to protect the marketing interests of the Hoffman Electronics division of ITT, a principal supplier of VOR/DME systems, that Decca might have been poised to usurp.|$|R
40|$|Hardware and {{software}} {{aspects of the}} design of various microprocessor-based <b>Decca</b> Navigator radionavigation <b>receivers</b> are discussed. Two new hardware designs are presented. The Mark 5 receiver uses the "orange" channel of the Decca Navigator transmissions, {{and is based on}} a design published by J. D. Last; but unlike Last's design, it computes a position fix by directly measuring the phase of the signal, using phase-locked-loop techniques, with software correction for interrupt latency. The Mark 6 receiver dispenses with the phase-locked loop, and uses instead digital signal processing techniques to ascertain the phase of the received Decca Navigator carriers. Details of several algorithms used in the Mark 5 and Mark 6 receivers are presented, and their implementation discussed. A phase-determination algorithm is presented which compensates for local oscillator drift and for skew error due to movement of the vehicle during the measurement cycle, and which appears to be particularly resis [...] ...|$|R
