5|$|FC Barcelona, nicknamed Barça, is a {{football}} club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain that competes in La Liga, {{the most senior}} football league in Spain. Since its founding in 1899, the club has had 40 different presidents. The club {{is owned by the}} club-members of FC Barcelona, and similarly to a limited liability company, they elect the president by a ballot. The president has the responsibility for the overall management of the club, including formally signing contracts with players and staff. In Spain, it is customary <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>to</b> watch the games in which the first-team participates, together with the president from the opposing team.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} his staff were anxious <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>to</b> appear to be {{recovering}} quickly, and the morning after his operation he saw visitors and signed a piece of legislation. Reagan left the hospital on the 13th day. Initially, he worked {{two hours a day}} in the White House's residential quarters, with meetings held there instead of the Oval Office. Reagan did not lead a Cabinet meeting until day 26, did not leave Washington until day 49, and did not hold a press conference until day 79. Ruge, the Physician to the President, thought recovery was not complete until October. Reagan's plans for the month after the shooting were canceled, including a visit to the Mission Control Center at Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, in April 1981 during STS-1, the first flight of the Space Shuttle. Vice President Bush instead called the orbiting astronauts during their mission. Reagan would visit Mission Control during STS-2 that November.|$|E
5|$|Before {{a person}} can be {{detained}} under the ISA by the Minister for Home Affairs, the President must be satisfied that such detention {{is necessary for the}} purposes of national security or public order. In the landmark case of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal sought to impose legal limits on the power of preventive detention by requiring the Government to adduce objective facts which justified the President's satisfaction. Two months after the decision, a series of legislative and constitutional amendments was enacted that effectively reversed the Chng Suan Tze decision. These amendments were subsequently confirmed to be valid by the High Court and Court of Appeal in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989–1990), which held it is sufficient <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>to</b> be subjectively satisfied that a detainee is a threat to national security in order for a detention order to be issued under the ISA. Notable ISA cases include Operation Coldstore in 1963 which led to the arrest of some 100 left-wing politicians and trade unionists, including members of the socialist opposition party, the Barisan Sosialis. Chia Thye Poh, an alleged Communist, was detained and subject to other restrictions on his liberty under the ISA from 1966 to 1998. The Chng Suan Tze and Teo Soh Lung cases resulted from a 1987 security operation called Operation Spectrum in which 22 Roman Catholic church and social activists and professionals accused of being members of a Marxist conspiracy were detained under the ISA.|$|E

25|$|When {{asked how}} this {{proposed}} legislation {{was different from}} the 1996 Line Item Veto Act that was found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, Bolten said that whereas the former act granted unilateral authority to the Executive to disallow specific spending line items, the new proposal would seek Congressional approval of such line-item vetoes. Thus, in order <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>to</b> successfully rescind previously enacted spending, a simple majority of Congress is required to agree to specific legislation to that effect.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, November 22, 1963, at 11:38a.m. CST, Kennedy, {{his wife}} Jacqueline, {{and the rest}} of the presidential entourage arrived at Love Field in {{northwest}} Dallas aboard Air Force One after a very short flight from nearby Carswell Air Force Base, west of Fort Worth. The motorcade cars had been lined up in a certain order earlier that morning. The original schedule was <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>to</b> proceed in a long motorcade from Love Field through downtown Dallas, and end at the Dallas Business and Trade Mart.|$|E
25|$|During the Bush Administration, {{targeted}} killings {{became a}} frequent tactic of the United States {{government in the}} War on Terror, with time reserved on Tuesday every week <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>to</b> approve the killing of selected targets without due process. Instances of targeted killing by the United States that have received significant attention include the killing of Osama bin Laden and of American citizens Anwar al-Awlaki and his teenage son in 2011. Under the Obama administration use of targeted killings has expanded, most frequently through use of combat drones operating in Afghanistan, Pakistan or Yemen.|$|E

25|$|Sirisena {{was sworn}} in as Sri Lanka's sixth {{executive}} president before Supreme Court judge K. Sripavan in Independence Square, Colombo at 6.20pm on 9 January 2015. It is custom <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>to</b> be sworn in before the chief justice but Sirisena had refused to be sworn in before Chief Justice Peiris who had been appointed by Rajapaksa after the controversial impeachment of the previous chief justice. Immediately afterwards, Wickremesinghe {{was sworn in}} as Sri Lanka's new prime minister before Sirisena. After being sworn in Sirisena stated that he would only serve one term.|$|E
25|$|The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 {{was passed}} by {{congress}} with Republicans voting 98% in favor in the Senate, and 97% in favor in the House. Democrats supported the joint resolution 58% and 39% in the Senate and House respectively. The resolution asserts the authorization by the Constitution of the United States and the Congress <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>to</b> fight anti-United States terrorism. Citing the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, the resolution reiterated {{that it should be}} the policy of the United States to remove the Saddam Hussein regime and promote a democratic replacement.|$|E
25|$|A {{committee}} of Army, Navy, Air Force, CIA, NSA, and State Department representatives created lists of priority targets for U-2 and other intelligence-gathering methods. The U-2 project received {{the list and}} drew up flight plans, and the committee provided a detailed rationale for each plan <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>to</b> consider as he decided whether to approve it. The CIA's Photo Intelligence Division grew in size {{to prepare for the}} expected flood of U-2 photographs. Before the aircraft became operational, however, the air force's Project Genetrix, which used high-altitude balloons to photograph the Soviet Union, China, and eastern Europe, led to many diplomatic protests from those countries and for a while CIA officials feared that the U-2 project was at risk. While Genetrix was also a technical failure—only 34 of the 516 balloons returned usable photographs—the balloon flights gave the United States many clues on how the Communist countries used radar to track overflights, which benefited the U-2 program.|$|E

25|$|The Constitutional Commission has {{the power}} to amend or reject the {{proposed}} changes before they are put to a vote for all MPs. The Commission made minor changes to numerous proposals, such as raising the number of members of the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors from 12 to 13. So far, the commission has rejected three of the 21 proposed changes, reducing the constitutional package from 21 proposals to 18. The 5th proposal, which created 'reserve MPs' to take the parliamentary seats that fall vacant between elections, was controversially rejected with just three signatures, well short of the support of 25 commission members or 184 total MPs necessary. It was reported that AKP MPs opposed the creation of 'reserve MPs' {{on the grounds that it}} threatened the security of sitting MPs by incentivising reserves to incapacitate them in order to take their seat. The 15th proposal that gave the President the right to structure the civil service and state institutions through executive decrees was also rejected. A day later on 29 December, the 14th proposal which gave the right <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>to</b> appoint senior bureaucratic officials was rejected.|$|E
25|$|The President {{may enter}} the United States into treaties, {{but they are}} not {{effective}} until ratified by a two-thirds vote in the Senate. In Article II however, the Constitution is not very explicit about the termination of treaties. The first abrogation of a treaty occurred in 1798, when Congress passed a law terminating a 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France. In the nineteenth century, several Presidents terminated treaties after Congress passed resolutions requesting the same. In 1854, however, President Franklin Pierce terminated a treaty with Denmark with the consent of the Senate alone. A Senate committee ruled that it was correct procedure <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>to</b> terminate treaties after being authorized by the Senate alone, and not the entire Congress. President Pierce's successors, however, returned to the former procedure of obtaining authorization from both Houses. Some Presidents have claimed to themselves the exclusive power of terminating treaties. The first unambiguous case of a President terminating a treaty without authorization, granted prior to or after the termination, occurred when Jimmy Carter terminated a treaty with the Republic of China. For the first time, judicial determination was sought, but the effort proved futile: the Supreme Court could not find a majority agreeing on any particular principle, and therefore instructed the trial court to dismiss the case.|$|E
25|$|On 18 February 1959, the Constitution Preparation Committee {{decided the}} 1959 plenary {{session of the}} Assembly would begin on 29 April 1959 (subsequently brought forward a week) and would discuss {{the form of the}} state and government, the {{preamble}} to the constitution and the broad outlines of state policy. However, the following day, the cabinet decided to implement Sukarno's concept of Guided Democracy under the 1945 Constitution. Army Chief of Staff General Abdul Haris Nasution had first proposed a return to Indonesia's original constitution in August 1958. Although the PNI agreed to his proposal in early 1959, the NU leadership only did in the face of threats that pending corruption charges against party leaders would be taken to court, although the party membership was not consulted. The PKI followed suit once it realized the restoration of the constitution was inevitable. However Masjumi members were strongly opposed because of the potential to turn the nation into a dictatorship, as it would be very easy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>to</b> abuse his power. There were also calls for the human rights clauses agreed by the assembly {{to be included in the}} 1945 Constitution. Prime Minister Djuanda admitted there were shortcomings in the Constitution, but said that it could be amended at a later date. Meanwhile, the Army organized demonstrations in favor of the return to the 1945 Constitution. Sukarno left the country on a tour on 23 April, with the government confident of a two-thirds majority on the Assembly - sufficient to reintroduce the 1945 Constitution. However, the debate in the Assembly turned away from constitutional issues into the question of Islam, splitting the membership. The government tried to pressure the NU, but on 23 May, the proposal to include the Jakarta Charter was defeated in a plenary session of the Assembly and the NU turned against a return to the 1945 Constitution. At the first vote on 30 May, despite it being open to put pressure on NU members to follow the leadership's line, the vote was 269 in favor and 199 against - short of the two-thirds necessary. A secret ballot, allowing the NU members to change their votes without it being known, was held on 1 June, but also failed, as did a final open vote on 2 June, with just 56% in favor. The next day, 3 June 1959, the Assembly went into recess, never to meet again.|$|E
