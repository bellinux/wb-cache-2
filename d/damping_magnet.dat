5000|$|The seismometers {{consisted}} of an inertial mass on a sensor boom suspended by springs and hinges, a capacitor plate and a <b>damping</b> <b>magnet.</b> The LP seismometers could {{function in a}} flat-response mode and in a peaked response mode. In the flat response mode, the LP seismometers had a natural period of 15 s. In the peaked-response mode, they acted as underdamped pendulums with a natural period of 2.2 s. Sensitivity to ground motion peaked sharply at 0.45 Hz in peaked response mode with a useful frequency range of 0.004 to 2 Hz. Maximum sensitivity was enhanced {{by a factor of}} 5.6 in the peaked response mode, but sensitivity to low-frequency signals was reduced. All seismometers could detect ground motions as small as 0.3 nm. At tidal frequencies, gravitational acceleration was measured by monitoring the feedback current used to center the seismometer mass. The sensitivity of the instruments was 0.008 mgal. The lunar surface impacts of the spent S-IVB and LM ascent stages were used as external calibration sources for the seismometers. The known mass and velocity of these stages at surface impact and the lunar impact point coordinates enabled the computation of energy generated at impact and the point of energy application. (The calibration characteristics were determined by measuring seismometer response to these energy sources.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The PSE {{unit was}} {{constructed}} principally of beryllium {{and had a}} mass of 11.5 kg, including the electronics module and thermal insulation. It was housed in a drum-shaped enclosure 23 cm in diameter and 29 cm in height. The enclosure was rounded {{on the bottom and}} rested on a leveling stool. The PSE consisted of two main subsystems, a sensor unit and an electronics module. The sensor unit contained three matched long-period (LP) seismometers aligned orthogonally in a triaxial set to measure one vertical and two horizontal components of surface motion. The horizontal component seismometers were very sensitive to tilt and were leveled to high accuracy by means of a two-axis motor-driven gimbal operated by ground command. A third motor adjusted the vertical component seismometer in the vertical direction. A fourth, short-period (SP) seismometer with a resonant period of 1 second measured vertical motion at a peak sensitivity of 8 Hz and a response range from 0.05 to 20 Hz. A thermal shroud and 6-W heater for thermal control comprised the rest of the experiment package. The thermal shroud was aluminized mylar which covered the instrument and the ground surrounding the base out to about 75 cm radially. A gnomon and level sensor were mounted on the top center of the shroud. The shroud was modified slightly from the one used on Apollo 12. Total power drain varied from 4.3 to 7.4 W.The seismometers consisted of an inertial mass on a sensor boom suspended by springs and hinges, a capacitor plate and a <b>damping</b> <b>magnet.</b> The LP seismometers could function in a flat-response mode and in a peaked response mode.

40|$|Next {{generation}} Linear Colliders require {{very low}} emittance beams {{in order to}} achieve sufficiently high luminosities. Due to the extremely small beam sizes of some ten nanometers height at the IP, these machines are very sensitive to ground motion leading to uncorrelated quadrupole jitter. As measurements per-formed at several laboratories indicate, the required vertical jit-ter tolerances of 30 nm rms for frequencies above … 2 Hz cannot be guaranteed in an active accelerator environment. Therefore, an active stabilization system based on geophones and piezo ac-tuators has been developed as part of the DESY S-band Linear Collider Test Facility. This system <b>damps</b> <b>magnet</b> motion in the frequency band 2 ¡ 30 Hz by up to¡ 14 dB; resulting in remain-ing jitter rms values of some 25 nm even in a very noisy environ-ment.

40|$|A circuit {{producing}} a pulse of over 100 A and a width programmable from 2 to 16 ms {{has been developed}} to power a beam bump. The switching circuit involves two SCR's. The pulse width is controlled by changing the tim-ing of the SCR triggers. An inductance is in series with the circuit, and additional diodes {{have been used to}} avoid any overshoot or undershoot during switching. The beam bump is part of the damping system used for accumula-tion and storage of electrons and positrons in the Cambridge Electron Accelerator ring. Dur-ing multicycle filling, the beam bump backleg windings move the beams approximately 1. 5 in-ches transversly into the <b>damping</b> <b>magnets</b> while the beam energy is near maximum. In or-der to store the particles at constant energy, the ac component of the synchrotron magnets excitation is decreased and the dc component increased. At the same time, the beam bump pulse is continuously increased in width and finally switched into a steady-state condition. The conversion process is completed with no loss in beam current...|$|R

50|$|As {{gravitational}} pull increases, the magnet's acceleration as it falls {{will tend to}} increase, except {{to the extent that}} the <b>damping</b> coefficient the <b>magnet</b> is experiencing (as a result of the conductor) increases, combined with the extent that the velocity of the magnet also increases— a magnet moving/ falling quickly will have its acceleration (i.e., its increase in speed as it falls) reduced more than one moving/ falling more slowly, and this effect on acceleration will be even more pronounced if the damping coefficient of the conductor is high.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for characterizing the emittance dilution and dynamic aperture for an arbitrary closed lattice that includes guide field magnet errors, multipole errors and misalignments. This method, developed and tested at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring Test Accelerator (CesrTA), {{has been applied}} to the damping ring lattice for the International Linear Collider (ILC). The effectiveness of beam based emittance tuning is limited by beam position monitor (BPM) measurement errors, number of corrector magnets and their placement, and correction algorithm. The specifications for <b>damping</b> ring <b>magnet</b> alignment, multipole errors, number of BPMs, and precision in BPM measurements are shown to be consistent with the required emittances and dynamic aperture. The methodology is then used to determine the minimum number of position monitors that is required to achieve the emittance targets, and how that minimum depends on the location of the BPMs. Similarly, the maximum tolerable multipole errors are evaluated. Finally, the robustness of each BPM configuration with respect to random failures is explored...|$|R
40|$|Chiral magnets with topologically nontrivial spin order such as Skyrmions have {{generated}} enormous interest in both fundamental and applied sciences. We report broadband microwave spectroscopy {{performed on the}} insulating chiral ferrimagnet Cu_ 2 OSeO_ 3. For the damping of magnetization dynamics we find a remarkably small Gilbert damping parameter of about 1 × 10 ^- 4 at 5 K. This value is only a factor of 4 larger than the one reported for the best insulating ferrimagnet yttrium iron garnet. We detect a series of sharp resonances and attribute them to confined spin waves in the mm-sized samples.

50|$|When a {{magnetic}} field moves through a conductor the movement induces an eddy current in the conductor. The flow of electrons in the conductor immediately creates an opposing magnetic field which results in <b>damping</b> of the <b>magnet</b> and produces heat inside the conductor similar to heat buildup inside of a power cord during use. The amount of energy transferred to the conductor {{in the form of}} heat is equal to the change in kinetic energy lost by the magnet— the greater the loss of kinetic energy of a magnet(a product of its mass and speed), the greater the heat buildup in the conductor and the more forceful the damping effect. Eddy currents induced in conductors are much stronger as temperatures approach cryogenic levels. This allows for critical damping for cryogenic applications and testing in the aerospace industry.|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} papers, {{the authors}} proposed {{two types of}} passive dampers using a lever-typedisplacement magnifying mechanism. One is a magnetic <b>damper</b> using rare-earth <b>magnets</b> and theother is a viscoelastic-friction damper using acrylic viscoelastic material. In this paper, {{a new type of}} hybrid damper using a lever-type displacement magnifyingmechanism, giant magnetostrictive actuators and rare-earth magnets is proposed. The hybriddamper generates controllable friction force together with magnetic damping force which acts as afail-safe mechanism in case of control system trouble, and is suitable for vibration in the region ofamplitude 0. 1 ~ 10 mm. The trial damper was made and the resisting force characteristics weremeasured. The seismic responses of a three-dimensional piping system supported by the damperwere measured using an electrohydraulic type shaking table. The experimental results are comparedwith the calculated results obtained by the finite element method (ANSYS), and the effects ofvibration suppression of the hybrid damper are discussed. Moreover, these experimental andcalculated results are compared with those obtained for a semiactive friction damper (which is oneremoved the rare-earth magnets from the hybrid damper) and a passive magnetic damper (which isone removed the giant magnetostrictive actuators from the hybrid damper) ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is the theoretical and numerical study of a device that allows recovering energy from an automobile suspension. In place of the viscous damper, which dissipates the kinetic energy of the vehicle due to rough roads or more marked obstacles, an electromagnetic damper performs {{the functions of the}} viscous shock absorber with a recovery of electric energy. The <b>damper</b> has permanent <b>magnets</b> and its working is based on the electromagnetic induction. The used ferromagnetic material is the Supermendur, which has very good ferromagnetic properties, but is expensive and difficult to found, so that the choice of different material is useful to reduce the costs. The mathematical model describes the operation of the damper, restoring the values of the electrical and mechanical magnitudes versus the relative speed between the stem and the stator. Several finite element analyses, conducted in ANSYS Workbench Magnetostatic, confirm both the magnetic field and flux values obtained through the theoretical analysis. A calculation example of the energy recovery is done considering an electric minicar transiting on a bumpy road (IRI= 3); the recovered power has a total value of 280 W about; at last a comparison with similar devices proves the excellent quality of the design also if the comparison should be done with uniformity of the parameters...|$|R
