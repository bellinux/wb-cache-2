50|$|<b>Hickory</b> <b>shad</b> have a {{relatively}} low commercial value; however, there is an increasingly popular recreational fishery throughout the mid-Atlantic states. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, <b>hickory</b> <b>shad</b> articles appeared in sport fishing magazines. Headlines such as “the tough fighting <b>hickory</b> <b>shad</b> swarm near the rock-studded fall line…” (Sports Afield 1988), and “feast on Rappahannock River <b>hickory</b> <b>shad</b> action” (Field & Stream 1992) brought attention to the fishery. Subsequently, specialty magazines (Fly Fisherman 2002) and sports sections in national newspapers (i.e., The Washington Post, 1988, 2000) began proclaiming the excitement of <b>hickory</b> <b>shad</b> fishing (“HICKORY SHAD ARE RUNNING!”) and {{the recovery of the}} fishery. In the two most recent years of a North Carolina creel survey (2004-2005), <b>hickory</b> <b>shad</b> - a fish only present for two months of the year - moved from sixth to the fourth most targeted fish by coastal anglers (Murauskas and Mumford 2006).|$|E
50|$|Although <b>hickory</b> <b>shad</b> {{research}} has been limited, other clupeids, especially Alosa species in the United States, have received more attention (e.g., Limburg and Waldman 2003). American shad (A. sapidissima), which overlaps in distribution with <b>hickory</b> <b>shad,</b> has been frequently studied (Atkinson 1951; Dodson and Dohse 1984; Melvin et al. 1986; Quinn and Adams 1996; Leonard and McCormick 1999a, 1999b; Leonard et al. 1999; Waters et al. 2000; Limburg and Waldman 2003; McBride and Matheson 2011).|$|E
50|$|<b>Hickory</b> <b>shad</b> are piscivorous, feeding {{primarily}} on small fishes, although crustaceans and squid {{contribute to their}} diet (Cooper 1983; Munroe 2002). One study showed that their diet on the spawning grounds was almost exclusively fish (97% by weight; Harris et al. 2007).|$|E
50|$|<b>Hickory</b> <b>shad</b> live {{to seven}} years (Harris et al. 2007). Both sexes mature at 2-4 years and can repeat spawn. Females are larger than males; in Florida, the average female is 37 cm fork length and the average male is 34 cm fork length (Harris et al. 2007).|$|E
50|$|During the shad {{spawning}} run, multiple {{species of}} shad run together. Fishing regulations may vary between species.

50|$|Most {{information}} about this species is contained in federal and state documents and management plans or theses from universities. Federal publications include reports from the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission’s (ASMFC) Interstate Fishery Management Plan for Shad and River Herring (ASMFC 1999; ASMFC 2001). Prominent publications by state agencies include reports based on fishery monitoring programs in Connecticut (Gephard and McMenemy 2004), Pennsylvania, Maryland (Chesapeake Bay Agreement 2000), North Carolina (NCDMF and NCWRC 2004), South Carolina, Georgia (Street and Adams 1969; Street 1969; Ulrich et al. 1979), and Florida (McBride 2000; Harris and McBride 2004; Harris et al. 2007; McBride and Holder 2008; McBride and Matheson 2011). A few publications address coast-wide and/or genus-level stock status and management issues (Rulifson 1994; Yako et al. 2002). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a useful series that includes egg, larvae, and juvenile development descriptions of <b>hickory</b> <b>shad</b> (Hardy 1978). A recent review of <b>hickory</b> <b>shad</b> in Chesapeake Bay places management of this species in an ecosystem context (Alosine Species Team, 2011).

40|$|In 1998, the Quaker Neck Dam {{was removed}} from the Neuse River near Goldsboro, North Carolina, {{restoring}} access to more than 120 km of potential main-stem spawning habitat and 1, 488 km of potential tributary spawning habitat to anadromous fishes. We used plankton sampling and standardized electrofishing to examine the extent to which anadromous fishes utilized this restored spawning habitat in 2003 and 2004. Evidence of spawning activity was detected upstream of the former dam site for three anadromous species: American shad Alosa sapidissima, <b>hickory</b> <b>shad</b> A. mediocris, and striped bass Morone saxatilis.

ICMR- 98 - 02 The <b>hickory</b> <b>shad</b> (Alosa mediocris), which {{supports}} commercial and recreational fisheries in the Roanoke River and Albemarle Sound, North Carolina, is an anadromous species {{closely related to}} the American shad (A. sapidissima). The Albemarle Sound population has exhibited a surge in numbers since 1989, but the cause is unexplained. Little is known about the life history of this species, which now supports a fast-growing sport fishery on the Roanoke River near Weldon, NC, and increased commercial catches in Albemarle Sound. The goal {{of this study was to}} characterize key life history aspects of <b>hickory</b> <b>shad</b> in the Albemarle Sound/Roanoke River watershed including the age, size, and sex compositions of the population, the sexual maturity schedule (age to maturity), potential fecundity of adults, and identification of the nursery grounds. Fish examined in this study were captured in 1996 from the Albemarle Sound and Roanoke River. The sex ratio(males:females) of adult fish sampled from Albemarle Sound and the Roanoke River at Weldon was statistically similar (0. 73 : 1 and 0. 76 : 1, respectively). A 57 % agreement was found between aging fish with scales and otoliths; scales overestimated younger-aged fish and underestimated older-aged fish. Most males were age 3 and most females were age 4; few fish were older than age 4 and the maximum age was 7. Males were generally smaller than females; overlapping lengths and weights at age make estimates of size at age difficult. Some fish were mature by age 2, and all were essentially mature by age 3. Fecundity estimates ranged from 80, 290 to 478, 944 eggs with most fish spawning two or three times before leaving the population (from harvest or natural mortality). Reduced visceral fat of fish in the Roanoke River indicated use of stored lipid reserves during migration. Juvenile <b>hickory</b> <b>shad</b> apparently do not utilize Albemarle Sound as a nursery ground in the same manner as American shad and river herring (A. aestivalis and A. pseudoharengus), but they may use coastal ocean waters.

40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} overlap between zooplankton and larval American shad (Alosa sapidissima), river herring (alewife A. pseudoharengus and blueback herring A. aestivalis), and <b>hickory</b> <b>shad</b> (A. mediocris) was evaluated in lower Roanoke River and Albemarle Sound, North Carolina. Zooplankton abundances {{in this system}} have historically been lower than those found in other coastal river systems. It was hypothesized food limitation during the early life history of alosines was contributing to recruitment failure. Zooplankton and ichthyoplankton samples were collected concurrently March through June 2008 - 09 at 19 stations, within three areas: River, Delta, and Sound. Significant spatial {{and temporal}} differences were observed for alosine abundances. Abundances (number/ 100 m[superscript] 3 ± SD) were significantly higher in 2009 (30. 8 ± 149. 8), than in 2008 (4. 1 ± 20. 9). Across both years, River (21. 0 ± 127. 6) alosine abundances {{were significantly higher than}} those in Delta (7. 4 ± 35. 4) and Sound (4. 6 ± 24. 8). Zooplankton abundances were higher than observed in previous studies and did not differ significantly between years. Zooplankton abundances exhibited the opposite spatial trend of alosines with significantly higher abundances (number/m[superscript] 3 ± SD) observed in the Sound (16, 547 ± 14, 678) than in the River (4, 934 ± 3, 806) and Delta (4, 647 ± 2, 846). Differences in zooplankton composition were evaluated using analysis of similarity. Composition in the Sound significantly differed from the River and Delta. Canonical correspondence analysis explored the relationship between zooplankton and the environment and found that some differences in composition could be explained by salinity preferences of zooplankton taxa. Zooplankton size distribution was evaluated and the most common taxa segregated into two groups based on size. Rotifers and copepod nauplii comprised the small size group and Daphniidae, Bosminidae, calanoid copepods, and cyclopoid copepods composed the larger size class. Mouth gape models were developed for each alosine species and used to estimate maximum prey size at first feeding. At first feeding, alewives, blueback herring, and <b>hickory</b> <b>shad</b> are primarily able to consume copepod nauplii and rotifers. Larval American shad are larger and have a wider potential prey breadth including Bosminidae, cyclopoid copepods, copepod nauplii and rotifers, at first feeding.

The Connecticut River Atlantic Salmon Commission manages the program. Emphasis has been placed on the provision of fish passage at barrier dams. Early fishways were justified on the basis of existing American shad runs, and later upriver fishways were built to support future salmon runs. Fishways existed at five mainstem dams and eight tributary dams, with facilities for downstream fish passage provided at many additional dams. Salmon restoration has been pursued with stocking of hatchery-reared fry and smolts, catch prohibitions, kelt reconditioning, fish health management, and various genetic management and marking schemes.

Fishes were collected seasonally in 3 sites at upstream and 5 sites at downstream of the dam using cast net and kick net. A total number of fish caught from the study area was 8, 733 fish representing 15 families and 45 species, and Cyprinidae and Gobiidae Families had twenty-four (53. 3 %) and four (8. 9 %) species, respectively. However, rest of families composed of one to three species. There was the 2 nd-class endangered species, Sand lamprey (Lampetra reissneri), found in the upstream (Site 3) of the dam, and fourteen Korean endemic species (31. 1 %) including southern king spine loach (Iksookimia hugowolfeldi). In the mean time, one foreign introduced species, Crucian carp. (Carassius cuvieri) was mostly found in upstream of the dam among the 45 species. The number of species in each site ranged 20 to 34 species, and it tended to increase toward to downstream. The species of pale chub (Zacco platypus, 43. 5 % relative abundance) and dark chub (Zacco temminckii, 14. 7 %) were dominant and subdominant species, and 14 species including eel (Anguilla japonica) comprised less than 0. 1 % relative abundance (rare species) of the total catch. Compared to assessments in previous years (1998 ~ 2004), {{the number of species}} found in 2005 was the maximum. Fifteen species were not confirmed at this year even if they were found in previous years, and some of them including <b>hickory</b> <b>shad</b> (Konosirus punctatus) were peripheral species of fish collected in only single year. Whereas three species (Lampetra reissneri, Carassius cuvieri, Hemiculter eigenmanni) was confirmed {{for the first time in}} 2005. Based on the results, modification of fish fauna and community in Tamjin River watershed should be monitored in detail in order to assess any negative effect due to dam construction, and additional investigation for the endangered species needs to be performed to establish conservation of their habitat and population...|$|E
