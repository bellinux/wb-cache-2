Steph has big plans for her wedding day and <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it’s getting out of control as Jack worries about how much it's going to cost, with Jack even suggesting to Frankie and Steph that he should call Johnno and ask him to contribute to the cost of the wedding, a suggestion that Steph and Frankie refute immediately on the basis that Johnno was never very good with money, and also that he was now married to Michelle and was therefore preoccupied with bringing up his new son Presley. With only 48 hours until their big day everything starts to go wrong and when Steph accidentally rips her wedding dress it's the final straw. A devastated Steph announces there's no way the wedding can go ahead on Thursday.|$|E
25|$|A week later, Jake {{leaves to}} go fishing with his crew, one of whom observes that <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a storm is coming in. Peter, still unsure of his crime, returns from prison. Meanwhile, Bess is lying in Porgy's room delirious with fever, which she has had ever since {{returning}} from Kittiwah Island. Serena prays to remove Bess's affliction ("Oh, Doctor Jesus"), and promises Porgy that Bess will be well by five o'clock. As the day passes, a strawberry woman, Peter (the Honey Man) and a crab man each pass by with their wares ("Vendors' Trio"). As the clock chimes five, Bess recovers from her fever. Porgy tells Bess that he knows she has been with Crown, and she admits that Crown has promised to return for her. Porgy tells her she is free to go if she wants to, and she tells him that although she wants to stay, she is afraid of Crown's hold on her. Porgy asks her {{what would happen if}} there was no Crown, and Bess tells Porgy she loves him and begs him to protect her, and he promises that she will never have to be afraid again ("I Loves You, Porgy").|$|E
500|$|The Doni Tondo is {{believed}} to be the only existing panel picture Michelangelo painted without the aid of assistants; and, unlike his Manchester Madonna and Entombment (both National Gallery, London), the attribution to him has never been questioned. [...] The juxtaposition of bright colors foreshadows the same use of color in Michelangelo’s later Sistine ceiling frescoes. The folds of the drapery are sharply modeled, and the skin of the figures is so smooth, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the medium is marble. The surface treatment of the massive figures resembles a sculpture more than a painting. [...] The nude figures in the background have softer modeling and look to be precursors to the ignudi, the male nude figures in the Sistine Ceiling frescoes. Michelangelo’s technique includes shading from the most intense colors first to the lighter shades on top, using the darker colors as shadows, a technique called cangiante. By applying the pigment in a certain way, Michelangelo created an [...] "unfocused" [...] effect in the background and focused detail in the foreground. [...] The most vibrant color is located within the Virgin’s garments, signifying her importance within the image. [...] X-rays of the painting show that Michelangelo incorporated every known pigment used at the time. [...] The masculinity of Mary could be explained by Michelangelo’s use of male models for female figures, as was done for the Sistine Chapel.|$|E

500|$|The Real Housewives of Atlanta {{has been}} {{moderately}} well received by critics. Writing for Common Sense Media, Melissa Camacho spoke favorably of the series' emphasis on [...] "a successful and powerful {{segment of the}} African-American community" [...] {{that appears to be}} frequently neglected by the popular television. Tim Hall from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer commented of his general distaste for reality television, particularly describing The Real Housewives of Orange County as [...] "utterly ridiculous". However, he admitted that the dynamic and conflict between the women, in addition to the wealthy lifestyles they led, to be [...] "somewhat entertaining". In a more mixed review, Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times joked that its portrayal of wealth served as [...] "the best choice for a time capsule of the Bling Decade" [...] when noting the economic downturn the United States experienced around the time that the series premiered, although more seriously stated that the housewives' luxuries [...] "was never all that enviable, and now <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it might not be viable." [...] Hanh Nguyen from Zap2It shared a similar sentiment, criticizing that the [...] "showy elite and rampant consumerism" [...] that the women regularly display [...] "seems rather out of touch" [...] given the United States' economic hardship, although she elaborated that the program [...] " [...] not by any means boring, but you do {{have to be in the}} mood to watch." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{interaction}} between Reynolds and Bullock was well received by critics. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly opined that the chemistry {{between the two}} actors was [...] "fresh and irresistible." [...] Zorianna Kit of The Huffington Post exclaimed that [...] "what [...] audiences of this lite-fare comedy in their seats is the undeniable on-screen chemistry between leads Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds." [...] She continued: [...] "The two are so adept at comedy and have so much fun with one another, viewers watching The Proposal won't be able to resist their charms, even {{when some of the}} plot veers in to unnecessarily silliness." [...] Betsey Sharkley of the Los Angeles Times felt that their relationship was a [...] "cheeky update of The Taming of the Shrew." [...] She opined, [...] "Bullock's deft physical comedy, one of her most endearing qualities, is given a full run. [...] Reynolds' ability to deliver a line, or a look, with withering, surgical precision is there at every turn." [...] Giving it a one out of five stars, The Guardian writer Peter Bradshaw gave a negative reaction to the {{interaction between}} Reynolds and Bullock. Bradshaw stated: [...] "Their initial sparky detestation isn't convincing, and neither is their later thawing and romance. In each scene, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they have never met before. And Margaret isn't permitted to be a convincing cow, because that would make her unsympathetic [...] Andrew can't be a total wimp, because that would be unsexy, so the fundamental comic premises of the film are fudged." ...|$|E
500|$|Peck {{and other}} {{commission}} members were {{not satisfied with}} the design proposals, and suggested some of their own. [...] Barber denigrated these in a letter to Roberts on June 8. [...] Peck had proposed that only the faces of Washington and Lafayette be shown, with no depiction {{of the rest of the}} head. [...] Barber stated, [...] "I am of the opinion that the heads of Washington and Lafayette should be treated from the sculptor's standpoint, and every effort be made to represent them with a grandeur and dignity commensurate with the position they fill in the Nation's history, which certainly could not be done if they are to be shown peeping out of a half moon." [...] At the instructions of Roberts, Barber went to New York and met with Peck over two days on June 14 and 15. Afterwards, Barber reported to the Mint Director, [...] "I think we will hear no more of the Lafayette prayer" [...] and that Peck now appreciated that the space available for a design, even on a silver dollar (the largest US coin) was limited, [...] "and as it is the desire of the Committee [...] to have the monument displayed, the prayer will have to find some other place". Although Barber indicated that the decision of the commission to represent the statue without its pedestal represented progress toward the point where he might engrave dies, [...] "I learned in New York that the work of the sculptor must be submitted to a committee in Paris who will have entire charge of the monument, and the sculptor's work has to be changed in any and every detail until it meets the approval of this Committee of Frenchmen... to me <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it might be sometime in 1900." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film {{received}} negative reviews upon release.

[...] However, he criticized what he felt were poor characterizations and illogical plot elements, ultimately giving the film 2½ stars out of 4. In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby called it [...] "a foolish, depressing, overproduced movie that mixes horror with science fiction to make something that is fun as neither one thing or the other. Sometimes <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it aspired to be the quintessential moron movie of the 80s."

Entertainment Weekly critic Ken Tucker stated [...] "Bad is a superlatively fresh metaphor for a middle-age crisis: It took cancer and lawbreaking to jolt Walt {{out of his}} suburban stupor, to experience life again—to take chances, risk danger, do things he didn't think himself capable of doing. None of this would work, of course, without Emmy winner Cranston's ferocious, funny selflessness as an actor. For all its bleakness and darkness, there's a glowing exhilaration about this series: It's a feel-good show about feeling really bad." [...] San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman claimed [...] "The first three episodes of Season 2 that AMC sent out continue that level of achievement with no evident missteps. In fact, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Gilligan's bold vision for Breaking Bad, now duly rewarded against all odds, has invigorated everyone involved in the project. You can sense its maturity and rising ambition in each episode." [...] Horror novelist Stephen King lauded the series, comparing it {{to the likes of}} Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet.|$|E
2500|$|Mikhail Gershenzon deplored the way Lokhvitskaya {{has been}} totally {{misunderstood}} {{by the general}} readership; only [...] "those enchanted by the subtle aromas of poetry, its musicality, easily recognized her exceptional gift." [...] Speaking of the posthumous compilation Before the Sunset (Перед Закатом), he wrote: [...] "She could rarely fulfill all of her ideas in one piece, but her poetic designs worked best when she herself wasn't aware of their inner meaning. In the art of bringing individual verses, lines even, to perfection, she had no equal. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> not a single Russian poet has ever come as close as she did to Pushkin's lucid clarity, her verses being easily as catchy." [...] Summarizing Lokhvitskaya's development over the years, Gershenzon wrote: [...] "While in her earlier poems there prevailed a 'hurry up, lover, my oil is burning' kind of motif, her latter works documented the process of her soul getting deeper and quieter. As if the moment she spotted this mysterious pattern of things beyond the passions adorning human life's fanciful facade, walls opened wide to let her see through into the unfathomable space." ...|$|E

Mrs Allen was found by a housemate, Miss Jane Plenderleith, who had been away in the country the previous night.
