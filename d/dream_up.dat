25|$|Donahey was a {{very shy}} child when growing up. He would <b>dream</b> <b>up</b> {{imaginary}} characters and The Teenie Weenies as a pastime. He later turned them into a profession {{in the form of}} comic features in newspapers, books and advertising.|$|E
500|$|For the {{remainder}} of his career, much of Zappa's work was influenced by his use of the Synclavier as a compositional and performance tool. Even considering the complexity of the music he wrote, the Synclavier could realize anything he could <b>dream</b> <b>up.</b> The Synclavier could be programmed to play almost anything conceivable, to perfection: [...] "With the Synclavier, any group of imaginary instruments can be invited to play the most difficult passages... with one-millisecond accuracy—every time". Even though it essentially did away with the need for musicians, Zappa viewed the Synclavier and real-life musicians as separate.|$|E

500|$|We {{too often}} forget the {{humanity}} of doctors and nurses. They become godlike {{to most of us}} and yet it is their humanity that makes them so interesting and enjoyable. We are not doing a drama and have no intention of doing anything like dealing with life and death issues. We want to make people laugh so we de-emphasize the more serious elements of hospital life. It isn't that he [...] just sees things differently, he also deals with them differently. That is why Noland will <b>dream</b> <b>up</b> a baby derby, a gambling night at the hospital, a variety show at Christmas and off-track betting when patients get bored with the hospital routine.|$|E
500|$|Billy Dukes of Taste of Country {{praised the}} video saying, [...] "The magic and theatrics she’s {{able to capture}} on stage rival what almost anyone else is able to <b>dream</b> <b>up</b> for a more Hollywood-like “produced” music video." [...] During the week of its release, the music video had over 400,000 views and helped push Swift up the Billboards Social 50, moving her from number {{nineteen}} to ten. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News praised the footage of the video saying that it [...] "perfectly encapsulates the tour's high-octane energy including theatrical set changes, dancers, aerialists, fireworks, pyrotechnics, costume changes and the occasional rainstorm." [...] The video was {{number one on the}} week's most streamed videos on August 27, 2011 for Yahoo! Music. To date, the video has over 38 million views on YouTube.|$|E
500|$|Rinder {{told the}} Tampa Bay Times that interrogations [...] "would {{be carried out}} by whoever {{happened}} to be there– 20 people, 30 people, 50 people, all standing up and screaming at you, and ultimately it sort of devolved into physical violence, torture, to extricate these 'confessions' out of people." [...] According to Rinder, the confessions were sometimes dictated by Miscavige, but more usually the inmates of the Hole would force each other to confess: [...] "The 50 people there are all screaming at me, telling me I've got to confess– I've done that, why don't I just admit it? I stole money, I had affairs– people would just literally <b>dream</b> <b>up</b> bullshit and start screaming it out, and then the mob goes crazy: 'Oh yeah, it must have been that!'" [...] Tom De Vocht, who was also in the Hole, recalled that [...] "everybody in that damned room— people are wild and out of control, I punched somebody. Everybody was punched. And screaming and yelling. It just got like, 'What {{the hell is going on}} here?'" [...] De Vocht rationalized his own involvement on the grounds of self-defense: [...] "If I don't attack I'm going to be attacked. It's a survival instinct in a weird situation that no one should be in." ...|$|E

2500|$|Like many of Marvel's Silver Age characters, Doom was {{conceived}} by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. With the Fantastic Four title performing well, Lee and Kirby {{were trying to}} <b>dream</b> <b>up</b> a [...] "soul-stirring…super sensational new villain." [...] Looking for a name, Lee latched onto [...] "Doctor Doom" [...] as [...] "eloquent in its simplicity — magnificent in its implied menace." ...|$|E
2500|$|The G8 {{summit is}} an {{international}} event which is observed and reported by news media, but the G8's continuing relevance after more than 30 years is somewhat unclear. More than one analyst suggests that a G-8 summit {{is not the place}} to flesh out the details of any difficult or controversial policy issue in the context of a three-day event. Rather, the meeting offers an opportunity to bring a range of complex and sometimes inter-related issues. The G8 summit brings leaders together [...] "not so they can <b>dream</b> <b>up</b> quick fixes, but to talk and think about them together." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Jones, {{reviewing}} {{the book in}} The Times, criticised the hypothesis as magical thinking and pseudoscience, saying that morphic resonance [...] "is so vast and formless that it could easily be made to explain anything, or to dodge round any opposing argument ... Sheldrake has sadly aligned himself with those fantasists who, {{from the depths of}} their armchairs, <b>dream</b> <b>up</b> whole new grandiose theories of space and time to revolutionize all science, drape their wooly generalizations over every phenomenon they can think of, and then start looking round for whatever scraps of evidence that seem to them to be in their favour". Jones argued that without confirmatory experimental evidence, [...] "the whole unwieldy and redundant structure of [...] theory falls to Occam's Razor".|$|E

2500|$|The home {{of choice}} (domus) then became the {{countryside}} villa as {{the rise of}} the Roman Empire made them even wealthier. They could afford almost anything they could <b>dream</b> <b>up</b> {{in the way of a}} residence, especially among the large and middle class Roman landowners. Greek-style architecture became their new villa otium outside of town. In ancient Roman times the [...] "otium villa [...] " [...] was a Dionysian idealistic rural home setting that evoked peace, leisure, simplicity and serenity. [...] Often in ancient writings is found the mention of restorative powers due its natural setting (otium) in the rural country home, contrasted to the busy city life with all the businesses (negotium). The [...] "villa with a garden" [...] and [...] "villa by the sea" [...] was associated with otium.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Late Night host David Letterman was {{preparing}} to leave, prompting executive producer Lorne Michaels {{to search for a}} new host. Michaels approached O'Brien to produce; then-agent Gavin Polone stressed that O'Brien wanted to perform, rather than produce. He arranged with Michaels that O'Brien would do a test audition on the stage of The Tonight Show. Jason Alexander and Mimi Rogers were the guests, and the audience was composed of Simpsons writers. Wolodarksky recalled the experience: [...] "Seeing this friend of yours, this guy that you worked with, walk out from behind that curtain and deliver a monologue was like something you could only <b>dream</b> <b>up</b> that you couldn’t ever imagine actually happening." [...] The performance was beamed by satellite to New York, where Lorne Michaels and NBC executives watched. O'Brien was picked as the new host of Late Night on April 26, 1993. As the writers headed to the voice record for [...] "Homer Goes to College", O'Brien {{received a phone call from}} Polone informing him of the decision. [...] "He was passed out facedown into this horrible shag carpet. He was just quiet and comatose down there on that carpet," [...] recalled postproduction supervisor Michael Mendel. [...] "I remember looking at him and saying, 'Wow. Your life is about to change, in a really dramatic way.'" ...|$|E
