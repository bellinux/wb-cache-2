50|$|Given the {{limitations}} on truck weight and size, increased productivity {{in the industry}} comes from two sources: fewer empty miles and less time waiting between loads. U.S. Department of Transportation figures indicate that empty routes have continued to account for 29% of single-unit truck traffic; this has been equated to an annualized 15 billion gallons of gasoline, $30 billion cost, or 149 million tons of excess carbon emissions. Traditional <b>freight</b> <b>brokers</b> acted as intermediaries to manage the coordination of freight, helping independent drivers or companies match loads with available empty trucks.

50|$|The {{proliferation}} of <b>freight</b> <b>brokers</b> {{called for an}} increase in financial integrity and liability of these companies, which has led to the passing of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). In order to obtain a license to broker freight, a freight brokerage must purchase a surety bond or trust agreement with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). Prior to June 2012 when the bill was signed by President Obama, the surety bond coverage required to hold a broker license was $10,000. Effective October 1, 2013, the surety bond requirement increased to $75,000. On December 12, 2015 the FMCSA brought into effect, the United Registration System.

50|$|Often, an LTL shipper may realize savings by {{utilizing}} a <b>freight</b> <b>broker,</b> online marketplace or other intermediary, instead of contracting directly with a trucking company. Brokers can shop {{the marketplace and}} obtain lower rates than most smaller shippers can obtain directly. In the LTL marketplace, intermediaries typically receive 50% to 80% discounts from published rates, where a small shipper may only be offered a 5% to 30% discount by the carrier. Intermediaries are licensed by the DOT and have requirements to provide proof of insurance.|$|R

50|$|In the United States, {{freight broker}} surety bonds are {{required}} by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to move property such as household goods or freight and motor cargo (vehicles).

50|$|Shipping experts {{optimize}} {{their service}} and costs by sampling rates from several carriers, brokers and online marketplaces. When obtaining rates from different providers, shippers {{may find a}} wide range in the pricing offered. If a shipper in the United States uses a broker, freight forwarder or other transportation intermediary, {{it is common for}} the shipper to receive a copy of the carrier's Federal Operating Authority. <b>Freight</b> <b>brokers</b> and intermediaries are also required by Federal Law to be licensed by the Federal Highway Administration. Experienced shippers avoid unlicensed brokers and forwarders because if brokers are working outside the law by not having a Federal Operating License, the shipper has no protection {{in the event of a}} problem. Also, shippers normally ask for a copy of the broker's insurance certificate and any specific insurance that applies to the shipment.|$|E
50|$|Consolidators, customs brokers, freight forwarders, and NVOCC’s can be {{a factor}} in {{determining}} freight rate because of their experience, business relationships, and the volume at which they operate. These factors help keep the freight rate down for small businesses and the individual with a shipping need. In the commercial trucking industry, many shippers tender loads to <b>freight</b> <b>brokers</b> {{whose job it is to}} find qualified carriers to move the freight at an acceptable price for all parties. Brokers have access to a suite of technological tools to help determine the most cost-effective way to move cargo, including access to load boards. The best load boards provide rate analysis tools based on actual transactions on every lane in North America, since their databases hold a wealth of pricing information. For example, DAT Solutions offers RateView for carriers, brokers and shippers, providing access to shippers’ contract rates and spot market (broker buy) rates. This allows brokers to analyze market demand and capacity to assure competitive pricing.|$|E

Moe expanded to provide fuel, food, and accommodations to truckers on the road, {{the origin of}} Jubitz Truck Stop. The trucking industry was deregulated in the 1970s, encouraging independent truck drivers and small companies to find extra loads rather than returning empty. Mr. Jubitz noticed drivers hanging around his truck stop after the usual meal and shower, {{hoping to find a}} load. So he decided to start signing up brokers and shippers who needed freight hauled from Portland. Before the service, truck drivers seeking loads left handwritten notes on a bulletin board at the Jubitz Truck Stop in Portland, Oregon, U.S. for shippers and <b>freight</b> <b>brokers</b> seeking truckers to move their freight. Jubitz began posting the loads on a monitor at the truck stop and charging drivers a fee for the phone number of the company wanting to move freight.|$|E
