2500|$|The county {{since the}} mid-1990s has seen much real estate {{speculation}} and development and a population increase, as many new residents purchase <b>existing</b> <b>housing</b> <b>stock</b> as well as condominiums in high and mid rise developments, many along the waterfront.

The exploitation of {{certain parts of the}} waterfront and other brownfields led to commercial development as well, especially along former rail yards. Hudson felt the short- and long-term impact of the destruction of the World Trade Center intensely: its proximity to lower Manhattan made it a place to evacuate to, many residents who worked there lost their jobs (or their lives), and many companies sought office space across the river. Re-zoning, the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, and New Jersey State land-use policy of transit villages have further spurred construction. Though very urban and with some of the highest residential densities in the United States the Hudson communities have remain fragmented, due in part to New Jersey's long history of home rule in local government; geographical factors such as Hudson River inlets/canals, the cliffs of the New Jersey Palisades and rail lines; and ethnic/demographic differences in the population. As the county sees more development this traditional perception is challenged.|$|E

40|$|Many New Zealand {{studies have}} argued that house energy {{retrofit}} produces limited benefits, but {{the issue of how}} <b>existing</b> <b>house</b> retrofitting can lead to better energy performance and comfort improvement is little explored. The aim of this thesis was to examine the influence of house retrofit on energy efficiency and thermal comfort, using house model simulation and calculation. This study gives a holistic house retrofit approach in thermal comfort improvement and energy conservation. Three house retrofit categories were defined by household energy breakdown: Space Heating Retrofit, Hot Water System Retrofit and Appliances Retrofit. This study started with an investigation of New Zealand <b>existing</b> <b>house</b> <b>stock.</b> A typical <b>house</b> model was defined by the summarized common physical characteristics. This house model was used for retrofit testing. For the building space heating retrofit study, a series of thermal simulations was completed with different retrofit options. Thermal simulation results were compared both in thermal comfort and space heating energy requirement. It was discovered that the optimum level full insulation retrofit significantly reduced space heating energy requirement and also improved thermal comfort. Retrofit solutions for water heating, lighting and appliances were compared by cost and energy saving. Cost effectiveness cross comparison for all of the retrofit solutions was carried out. Retrofitting for space heating system and hot water system can be considered for long term cost effectiveness. Appliances and lighting retrofit have a higher efficacy than other retrofit options in terms of energy saving and cost benefit cycle. These findings are used to provide suggestions for retrofitting of <b>existing</b> <b>houses...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} how local governments can improve the energy quality of the <b>existing</b> social <b>housing</b> <b>stock.</b> A stakeholder analysis is performed to identify the main drivers and barriers for each stakeholder. Closer analysis of these drivers and barriers reveals that the financial side {{of the problem is}} complicated but manageable and that the crucial factor is communication. Effective communication should be tailored to the reference framework of the target group. These reference frameworks are identified by means of a discourse analysis. Municipalities consequently frame the issue as a climate problem, although energy conservation in housing also has profound poverty, employment and health effects. The climate story does not resonate with the money and comfort discourses of the housing associations and the tenants. The main conclusion from this research is that municipalities should frame and treat energy conservation in housing as a poverty issue, with positive effects on employment, health and climate as well. Reframing the issue and embedding it in the corresponding policy programmes will significantly increase the support base and subsequently unlock budgets on a scale that far exceeds typical funding of climate policy. The main conclusion is embedded in a policy design that also contains an enabling framework based on creating partnerships and closing performance agreements. These two components form the basis of a comprehensive, governance based, policy advice for local governments to bring about energy conservation in the <b>existing</b> social <b>housing</b> <b>stock...</b>|$|R

Conducted study led to the preliminary design of energy refurbishment of the existing building, and its conversion to energy efficient building approaching Zero Energy and Zero CO 2 emission status, covering minimized loads and energy needs exclusively by renewable energy sources. Building’s dynamic behavior and energy efficiency have been optimized implementing BPS. Refurbishment encompassed comprehensive optimization of building’s envelope structure, natural and mixed ventilation, and HVAC system. The implementation of a series of EEI (energy efficiency improvement) measures resulted in significant reduction of buildings energy loads.

The residential sector shows the greatest potential for improvement, with 25 % of global end use demand consumed by houses alone. Retrofitting provides promise for existing houses; increasing their life span whilst enabling upgrades in energy efficiency and spatial qualities. New Zealand's <b>existing</b> <b>house</b> <b>stock</b> is varied {{but one of the most}} prominent house types is the post-war state house, built between 1940 - 1960 across New Zealand. These houses make up the largest proportion of <b>existing</b> <b>houses</b> in New Zealand.

These houses remain stalled in the era in which they were designed and are now socially out of date, failing to meet the variety of needs of New Zealanders today. Changes in society and the way that we use our houses are explored and translated into architectural problems, which are addressed through the design of retrofit solutions. Long Live the State House asks the question: “How can the development of a spectrum of architectural interventions be used to retrofit <b>existing</b> post-war state <b>houses,</b> in order to extend their lifetime and usability, thus improving social, environmental and economic sustainability?” To answer this, the project explores retrofit solutions to current problems prevalent in these post-war state houses and aims to demonstrate alternative solutions to traditional housing models.

A distinctive characteristic of Hong Kong is the large number of high-rise buildings; however, many high-rise buildings in the old districts are in desperate need of maintenance due to deterioration. In order to protect the living conditions, there is an increasing demand for the repair and proper maintenance of <b>existing</b> <b>housing</b> <b>stocks.</b> Unfortunately, most research focuses on new construction with the repair and maintenance sector often being neglected. Of all the construction-related injuries, fall accidents are the leading cause of death and thus provoking great concern among industrial practitioners in Hong Kong. There is an urgent need to investigate the causes of fall accidents and to make recommendations to avoid recurrence of similar accidents. Based on the accident statistics obtained from the Labour Department (LD) of the HKSAR Government over the last five years (2000 - 2004), this paper examines the underlying causes of accidents involving falls from elevation in building repair and maintenance works. The nature of the accidents was analyzed according to the demographic characteristics of the victims, e. g. age and gender. Situations and locations with high risk, and seasonal distributions of accidents were identified. With a better understanding of the underlying causes of fall accidents, effective means can be developed to avoid the recurrence of similar accidents.
