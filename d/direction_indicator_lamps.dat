40|$|Summary There is {{some concern}} that vehicle <b>direction</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>lamps</b> with clear outer lenses make it {{difficult}} in bright, sunny conditions {{to decide whether the}} signal is on or not. This study photo-metrically evaluated, under bright, sunny conditions, both luminance contrast and colour contrast between the on and off states for <b>direction</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>lamps</b> that use either an amber lens or a dear lens. The results indicate that luminance contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using an amber lens. On the other hand, the results indicate that colour contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using a clear lens. Because luminance contrast {{is likely to be the}} primary variable influencing driver performance, these results suggest that using clear-lens direction indicators is likely to make it more difficult to determine, in bright, sunny conditions, whether the signal is on or not. However, the magnitude of the decrement in real-world performance with dear-lens signal lamps remains to be ascertained. ...|$|E

40|$|Development of {{a traffic}} light control system using PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) is {{the title of this}} project. This project is divided into two parts which are {{hardware}} and software. The hardware part for this project is a model of four way junction of {{a traffic light}}. Each lane has two limits switch (input) function as a sensor. Three <b>indicator</b> <b>lamps</b> with different colours (Red, Yellow and Green) are installed at each lane for represents as traffic light signal. This limit switches and <b>indicator</b> <b>lamps</b> are connected to Omron PLC CQM 1 H-CPU 51. The PLC controls every signal which is coming from the inputs (Limit switch) to software and display to the outputs (<b>Indicator</b> <b>lamps).</b> The software part operates with Omron PLC is CX-Programmer. With using this software, the ladder logic diagram is programmed to control the traffic light base on the flow chart. At the end of this project, the traffic light successfully control by PLC...|$|R

5000|$|ISIRI 6505 is a {{standard}} published by the Institute of Standards and Industrial Research of Iran (ISIRI) in 2011 based on Directive 1999/15/EC. It defines [...] "Direction <b>indicator</b> <b>lamps</b> for motor vehicles and their trailers".|$|R
50|$|Other safety {{features}} included soft-padded interior panels for appearance and safety, 3,329 square inches of tempered and laminated safety glass, prismatic rearview mirror, six turn-signal <b>indicator</b> <b>lamps</b> with asymmetrical flash, four-way hazard function, and lane departure function.|$|R

50|$|Another {{modification}} {{made to the}} PDP-10 by CompuServe engineers was {{the replacement}} of the hundreds of incandescent <b>indicator</b> <b>lamps</b> on the KI10 processor cabinet with LED lamp modules. The cost of the conversion was easily offset by the cost savings in electric consumption, the reduction of heat, and the manpower required to replace burned-out lamps. Digital followed this step all over the world. The picture on the right hand side shows the light panel of the MF10 memory which is contemporaneous with the KI10 CPU. This item is part of a computer museum, and was populated with LEDs in 2008 for demonstration purposes only. There were no similar banks of <b>indicator</b> <b>lamps</b> on KL and KS processors.|$|R
50|$|Instrumentation {{consists}} of an analog speedometer and tachometer and basic <b>indicator</b> <b>lamps,</b> incorporated under a tinted window, and a single tripmeter. While it normally was equipped with a centerstand, California models did not have room for one due to additional emissions control equipment.|$|R
50|$|There is a TPWS panel {{located in}} each driving cab {{of a train}} or locomotive. The TPWS panel {{comprises}} two <b>indicator</b> <b>lamps</b> and a push switch. There is also a separate TPWS Temporary Isolation Switch which is not shown in the example photograph.|$|R
50|$|A neon bulb, {{often used}} as an <b>indicator</b> <b>lamp</b> in appliances, {{consists}} of a glass bulb containing two electrodes, separated by an inert gas such as neon at low pressure.

This was updated to the Native American red {{arrowhead}} design for 1957 in all usage except the high-beam <b>indicator</b> <b>lamp,</b> which retained the original logo through 1970. The arrowhead logo is also known as the Dart.|$|R

50|$|An ARI-equipped radio would {{illuminate}} an <b>indicator</b> <b>lamp</b> to {{show that}} this function was in force. Most such radios would use this function further to help users search for ARI broadcasts. In the Radio Data System environment, the TP signal is equivalent to this basic function.|$|R
25|$|The Mark IV, {{launched}} in 1976, introduced a front rubber mounted subframe with single tower bolts and larger bushes {{in the rear}} frame. In addition twin stalk indicators were introduced with larger foot pedals, and from 1977 onwards the rear <b>indicator</b> <b>lamps</b> had the reverse lights incorporated in them.|$|R
50|$|Building {{upon this}} early success, API {{developed}} the RL1000 line of Ethernet 10Base5 transceivers. The RL1000 physical design was patterned on the rugged 3Com 3C107 transceiver, {{with the added}} feature of <b>indicator</b> <b>lamps</b> much like the Cabletron Systems ST500 transceiver, and it became relatively popular as a result.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{simulator}} of {{an on-line}} monitoring {{system for the}} range extender electric vehicle has been developed. The messages from the four control modules, the air pressure and fuel level sensors data, and the on/off switching states of 31 <b>indicator</b> <b>lamps</b> can be received through the control area network (CAN), and displayed on the graphic panel. The simulator was designed using the four DSP boards, variable resistors, and toggle switches instead of the four control modules, sensors, and switching state of <b>indicator</b> <b>lamps</b> on an actual series hybrid electric vehicle (SHEV) bus, respectively. The performance of the monitoring technologies was verified with the simulator at the laboratory, {{and then it was}} tested on an actual SHEV bus. The simulator is very useful at the initial development of the monitoring system at the hybrid-type or electrical vehicles...|$|R
