5|$|The murders {{received}} {{a large amount}} of media attention, both nationally and internationally. The press often compared the murders to those committed by the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, who murdered 13 women and attacked seven others (mostly prostitutes) between 1975 and 1981. There was some concern that the level of media coverage at the time could jeopardise a trial. The murders also sparked <b>debates</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> media over the laws surrounding prostitution.|$|E
5|$|A Confession of Faith {{to replace}} the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646. While there is little record {{of the actions of}} the Assembly during the writing of the Confession, it is clear that there were {{significant}} <b>debates</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Assembly over almost every doctrine found in it. The Confession was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to the Confession, which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved the Confession with revisions to the chapters on church censures, synods and councils, and marriage on 20June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted the Confession without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made this legislation a nullity.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{not invited}} to {{participate}} in the presidential debates because he did not meet the criteria of 15% support in five polls set by the Commission on Presidential Debates. In 2015, Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein filed a lawsuit against the commission, arguing that the commission and its rules violated antitrust law and the First Amendment. In August 2016, the lawsuit was dismissed. Johnson's poll numbers have been averaging between 7 and 9 percent. Johnson's campaign manager Ron Nielson argued for Johnson's inclusion, citing Ross Perot's admission to the <b>debates</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1992 debates, when Perot was polling at 8 percent.|$|E

5|$|Mayor Daley and all law {{enforcement}} officials who had been deposed {{were excluded from the}} report. Also, the 75 credible abuse cases were overlooked; the report focused on doubts about the torture of the four pardoned death row inmates. Among the final costs were $6.2 million for the investigation and $7 million to hire outside counsel for Burge and his cohort. Many activists were disappointed to learn that the statute of limitations meant that Burge would not be prosecuted for torture. <b>Debates</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> op-ed pages continued for days. Egan explained his report to the public with legal theories and federal jurisdiction issues.|$|E
5|$|Nowotny {{was given}} a state funeral in Vienna. The guard of honor was {{composed}} of his friend Karl Schnörrer, Oberst Gordon Gollob, Major Rudolf Schoenert, Hauptmann Heinz Strüning, Major Josef Fözö and Major Georg Christl. The eulogy was delivered by General der Jagdflieger Adolf Galland and Generaloberst Otto Deßloch. Nowotny was buried at the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna in a grave of honor sponsored {{by the city of}} Vienna, which was still part of Nazi Germany. Following an initiative by the Austrian Green Party and <b>debates</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Vienna Landtag, a resolution supported by Social Democrats and Greens was passed to remove the status of honor in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, companies applied {{the principles of}} corporate identity and corporate design to increase awareness and recognition by consumers and differentiation from competitors. Olivetti became famous for its attention to design through their corporate design activities. In 1936 Olivetti hired Giovanni Pintori in their publicity department and promoted Marcello Nizzoli from the product design department to develop design in a comprehensive corporate philosophy. In 1956, inspired by the compelling brand character of Olivetti, Thomas Watson, Jr., CEO of IBM, retained American architect and industrial designer Eliot Noyes to develop a corporate-wide IBM Design Program consisting of coherent brand-design strategy together with a design management system to guide and oversee the comprehensive brand identity elements of: products, graphics, exhibits, architecture, interiors and fine art. This seminal effort by Noyes, with his inclusion of Paul Rand and Charles Eames as consultants, {{is considered to be}} the first comprehensive corporate design program in America. Up to and during the 1960s, <b>debates</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> design community were focused on ergonomics, functionalism, and corporate design, while debates in management addressed Just in time, Total quality management, and product specification. The main proponents of design management at that time were AEG, Bauhaus, HfG Ulm, the British Design Council, Deutscher Werkbund, Olivetti, IBM, Peter Behrens, and Walter Paepcke.|$|E

5|$|The Presiding Officer (or Deputy Presiding Officer) decides {{who speaks}} in chamber debates {{and the amount}} of time for which they are allowed to speak. Normally, the Presiding Officer tries to achieve a balance between {{different}} viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak. Typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time. The Presiding Officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate. Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems. Members may call each other directly by name, rather than by constituency or cabinet position, and hand clapping is allowed. Speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in English, but members may use Scots, Gaelic, or any other language with the agreement of the Presiding Officer. The Scottish Parliament has conducted <b>debates</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gaelic language.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of conducting <b>debates</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gelukpa tradition {{was set in}} many monasteries of the Gelukpa sect, namely the Ganden Monastery, the Sera Monastery, the Drepung Monastery and the JIC, not only in pre-modern Tibet but also in other similar monasteries established in exile, such as in Sera, India. At each location in Tibet, the debates are held under eight debating schedules in a year, depending on the rituals and festivals observed during the whole year. Each daily session is held between eight breaks when students debate on issues of Buddhist scriptures and related subjects. In the Sera monastery, the debate alternated by rituals has a daily schedule (with alterations to suit the climatic season) of the Morning debate (7 AM to 10 AM), Noon debate (11 AM to 1 PM), Afternoon debate (2 PM to 4 PM) and Night debate (8.30 PM to 9.30 PM).|$|E
5|$|Undismayed by {{the loss}} of his papers, Bottomley {{embarked}} on an ambitious expansion scheme. On the basis of a lucrative contract to print the Hansard reports of <b>debates</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Westminster parliament, at the beginning of 1889 he founded the Hansard Publishing Union Limited, floated on the London Stock Exchange with a capital of £500,000. Bottomley boosted the company's credentials by persuading several notable City figures to join the company's board of directors. These included Sir Henry Isaacs, the Lord Mayor-elect of London, Coleridge Kennard, co-founder (with Harry Marks) of the London Evening News, and Sir Roper Lethbridge, the Conservative MP for Kensington North. This board approved the purchase by Bottomley of several printing businesses—he used intermediaries to disguise his considerable personal profits from these transactions. He also persuaded the board to give him £75,000 as a down payment for some publishing firms in Austria for which he was negotiating, although the firms were not acquired. These outgoings and other expenses absorbed the Union's capital, and with few significant revenue streams it quickly ran out of money. Nonetheless, without any statement of accounts, in July 1890 Bottomley announced a profit for the year of £40,877, and declared a dividend of eight per cent.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, {{straight}} {{after finishing}} Cold Feet, Bathurst went straight into filming My Dad's the Prime Minister, a series {{in which he}} portrays fictional British prime minister Michael Philips. The first series was broadcast in a Sunday afternoon CBBC slot in 2003. He watched <b>debates</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons {{to prepare for the}} role but did not base his portrayal on Tony Blair. In 2003, he returned to theatre {{for the first time in}} four years to play Vershinin in The Three Sisters, opposite Kristin Scott Thomas and Eric Sykes. He had not seen The Three Sisters before starring in it. Director Michael Blakemore advised him to turn this to his advantage, as he would not feel he had to live up to previous portrayals. After its run concluded, a special edition of The Three Sisters was filmed with the same cast for television broadcast on BBC Four. In 2005, the second series of My Dad's the Prime Minister was broadcast, now moved to a Friday night time slot to take advantage of the adult humour. The same year, he starred in the ITV thriller The Stepfather playing Christopher Veazey, a man whose daughter goes missing. Bathurst was pleased that this white-collar worker had an emotional side, in comparison to David Marsden, whom he used as a yardstick when accepting those sorts of roles. Also in 2005, he played Mr Sesseman in an adaptation of Heidi and Dottore Massimo in The Thief Lord.|$|E
