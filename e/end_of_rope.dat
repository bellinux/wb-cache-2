60|$|He {{reached up}} and put the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> with the hook, {{over the head of}} the tester bed, where the {{curtains}} ought to hang.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Tod {{put down}} the pail beside the bed, took up the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> with the hook--hesitated, and looked at Tommy Brock. The snores were almost apoplectic; but the grin was not quite so big.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, Trot, being {{invisible}} to all, was roaming around the room, and behind a bench {{she found a}} small <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> which she picked up. Then she seated herself in an out-of-the-way place and quietly waited.|$|E
5000|$|The {{standing}} end is {{the longer}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rope</b> {{not involved in}} the knot, often shown as unfinished. It is often (but not always) the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rope</b> under load after the knot is complete.|$|R
50|$|The dogshank is {{a variant}} of the sheepshank, where the eyes formed at each end have the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rope</b> passed through them to prevent the knot from spilling. At least one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rope</b> must be available.|$|R
50|$|Pioneering skills include knot tying (tying ropes {{together}}), lashing (tying spars {{together with}} rope), whipping (binding the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a <b>rope</b> with thin twine), splicing (joining or binding the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a <b>rope</b> using its own fibres), and skills {{related to the}} use, care and storage <b>of</b> <b>ropes,</b> spars and related pioneering equipment.|$|R
60|$|For a time I {{could see}} nothing of the two men. Next, in the light flashed from the stick, I guessed that Mr. Pike was {{in pursuit of the}} thing. He evidently must have {{captured}} it at the rail against the starboard rigging and caught a turn around it with a loose <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope.</b> As the vessel rolled to windward some sort of a struggle seemed to be going on. The second mate sprang to the mate's assistance, and, together, with more loose ends, they seemed to subdue the thing.|$|E
60|$|Not knowing {{now what}} was to become of him unless he could {{discover}} some other means than those at his command, he climbed back again to the summit of the roof, and started off desperately upon another voyage of discovery. This time he succeeded better than before. He found about a cupola a terrace which he had not earlier noticed, and on this terrace a hod of plaster, a trowel, and a ladder some seventy feet long. He saw his difficulties solved. He passed an <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> about one of the rungs, laid the ladder flat along the slope of the roof, and then, still astride of the apex, he worked his way back, dragging the ladder with him, until he was once more on a level with the dormer.|$|E
60|$|Frank {{held the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> {{in both hands}} firmly, {{twisting}} it for greater security twice round his body: and the slenderest of the sailors, trusting himself the first to this safer bridge, crossed over the chasm with the ease and rapidity due to long practice on the masts and rigging. As soon as he had landed unhurt on the far side, he helped Frank to hold {{the end of the}} rope; and one by one his five companions and the officer last of all made good their passage in the self-same manner. I alone was left to keep up touch and facilitate their return to the hither side; for we felt we must probably fight for Kea. Our plan was to seize her by main force, before the natives were aware, retire with her to our horses, and ride down at all speed to the Hornet at Hilo.|$|E
5000|$|... back splice (also {{called an}} end splice) - A splice where the strands <b>of</b> the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rope</b> are spliced {{directly}} {{back into the}} end without forming a loop. It is used to finish off the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rope</b> {{to keep it from}} fraying. The <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rope</b> with the splice is about twice the thickness of the rest <b>of</b> the <b>rope.</b> With nylon and other plastic materials, the back splice is often no longer used; the rope strands are simply fused together with heat to prevent fraying.|$|R

One <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rope</b> may be anchored below the climber with the coils <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> in a bag on the climber's back, or for single-pitch climbs the device may be secured at ground level, and the climber tied into the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rope.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The triple fisherman's knot is a bend knot, used to join two <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> together. It is an {{extension}} of the double fisherman's knot and is recommended for tying slippery, stiff ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and aramid cored ropes.|$|R
6000|$|As my {{execution}} of the Irish melodies partakes of my imperfect perceptions {{of what is going}} on around me, so what is going on around me becomes something else than what it is. The stokers open the furnace doors below, to feed the fires, and I am again on the box of the old Exeter Telegraph fast coach, and that is the light of the for ever extinguished coach-lamps, and the gleam on the hatches and paddle-boxes is THEIR gleam on cottages and haystacks, and the monotonous noise of the engines is the steady jingle of the splendid team. Anon, the intermittent funnel roar of protest at every violent roll, becomes the regular blast of a high pressure engine, and I recognise the exceedingly explosive steamer in which I ascended the Mississippi when the American civil war was not, and when only its causes were. A fragment of mast on which the light of a lantern falls, an <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> and a jerking block or so, become suggestive of Franconi's Circus at Paris where I shall be this very night mayhap (for it must be morning now), and they dance to the self-same time and tune as the trained steed, Black Raven. What may be the speciality of these waves as they come rushing on, I cannot desert the pressing demands made upon me by the gems she wore, to inquire, but they are charged with something about Robinson Crusoe, and I think it was in Yarmouth Roads that he first went a seafaring and was near foundering (what a terrific sound that word had for me when I was a boy!) in his first gale of wind. Still, through all this, I must ask her (who WAS she I wonder!) for the fiftieth time, and without ever stopping, Does she not fear to stray, So lone and lovely through this bleak way, And are Erin's sons so good or so cold, As not to be tempted by more fellow- creatures at the paddle-box or gold? Sir Knight I feel not the least alarm, No son of Erin will offer me harm, For though they love fellow-creature with umbrella down again and golden store, Sir Knight they what a tremendous one love honour and virtue more: For though they love Stewards with a bull's eye bright, they'll trouble you for your ticket, sir-rough passage to-night! ...|$|E

5000|$|In Tibet, Vajrapani is {{represented}} in many fierce forms. Some of the notable ones are: Vajrapani-Acharya (Dharamapala) in a human form with only one head with a third eye with hair raised and crowned by a skull with fiery expression. His neck is adorned with a necklace of snakes, and with waist band made of tiger skin covered with skulls. Stepping to the right, his lifted hand holds a vajra. When painted in blue colour the image is encircled by flames with images of small Garudas; [...] Nilambara-Vajrapani with one head, with a third eye, a crown made of skull with four or six arms {{and in some cases}} with untidy hair bedecked with vajra and snake. Two hands are crossed to the breast in mystic posture (mudra), the second right hand is lifted up and carries a vajra. Stepping to the right, regally crowned and lying over a bed of snakes; in Achala-Vajrapani form he is shown with four heads, four arms and four legs adorned with symbols of vajra, sword, lasso and skull cup (kapala) and trampling over demons; Mahachakra-Vajrapani is a form with three heads and a third eye, and with six arms and two legs. The icon is adorned with symbols of vajra, snake with yum held in its main hands, and as shakti it to his left is shown holding a skull-cup (kapala) and grigug (chopper or hooked knife). The icon is shown stepping over Brahma on the right and on Shiva to the left; in the Thunderbolt-Wielder form known as [...] "snake charm form" [...] to protect from snake bites, he is depicted sitting on a lotus throne carried by peacocks. The right hand posture holds one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> noose to capture snake demons while the left hand held over the hips carries {{the other end of the}} noose. He is followed by two bodhisattvas - [...] "Sarvanivarana-Vishkambhin, Effacer of Stains, and Samantabhadra, the Entirely Virtuous One". His adornments consist of a tall crown and snakes coiling his arms and ankles. In a painted form, usually in white colour [...] "crossed-vajra" [...] is held to the left raised above the accompanying Bodhisattvas but when painted in blue colour the left hand holds a double vajra; his Garuda form is with wings and claws or with human head with a beak or head with wings fully spread (his painted form is in blue colour). he may be trampling over a demon or dead naga (snake). In some images he is shown carrying a sword, a bottle in the shape of a gourd, a chopper or hands held in a prayer mode.|$|E
