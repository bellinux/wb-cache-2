5|$|In August 1934, the Bassendean Road Board {{applied to}} the Lands Department to change {{the portion of the}} Perth–Guildford road within its {{district}} to Great Eastern Highway. The department refused the request, reasoning that most traffic bound for Midland used The Causeway and travelled {{on the south side of}} the Swan River, and that therefore the Perth–Guildford road should not be part of the main highway. Despite this setback, the Perth Road Board organised a local government conference to consider renaming the road from Perth to Guildford. The issue was considered important, as losing the name to the south side of the river would <b>divert</b> <b>traffic</b> away from the old established centres to the north. The straightening of dangerous bends and the replacement of an old bridge between Bassendean and Guildford were also to be considered. The conference, held on 7 September 1934, was attended by representatives of the Perth, Bayswater, Bassendean, and Guildford road boards, and the Midland Junction Council. Guildford and Midland Junction were still opposed to the renaming, but the others were supportive. Motions that passed included submitting a rename proposal to the state government, urging the government to construct a new bridge at Bassendean, and approaching the government to have the road declared a main road.|$|E
5|$|The depots and airbases {{depended}} on an efficient road network, so the engineers gave this a high priority. A major {{effort was made}} to bring the roads up to all-weather standard before onset of the 1942 wet season. New roads were also built. One of the first was the By Pass Road, which was designed to <b>divert</b> <b>traffic</b> from the main road, which ran around the south eastern end of Jackson Drome, and was therefore an operational hazard. The By Pass Road ran between Jackson and Wards Dromes, and was later extended to Berry, Schwimmer and Durand Dromes. The opening of the new wharf at Tatana Island in October caused a sudden jump in road traffic, so a new Barune Road was opened in November that provided a loop to Jackson and Wards Dromes. Fortunately, the local red shale contained clay and rock fragments, and when laid on a prepared subgrade and watered, either by sprinklers or rain, became hard like concrete. This could take motor vehicle traffic, although it became dusty when dry and slippery when wet. Surfacing material was obtained from the Nine Mile Quarry. Wood was found to be unsuitable for culverts, as it was quickly destroyed by the action of climate and insects. Oil drums were found to be superior, but they rusted, and using them for culverts depleted the drum supply.|$|E

40|$|A welfare {{economic}} {{approach is}} tried to an optimal decision of toll rate {{and expansion of}} urban expressway network in an equilibrium of toll revenues and cost of service supplied. The model, originated with Yamada, is such that the decision comes into optimality when the maximum consumers' surplus is reached in the equilibrium condition. The paper is concerned with some general aspects of the optimal solution and reexamination of the solution obtained {{in the past when}} used a specific demand curve. General aspects obtained are as follows; The extremum condition to consumers' surplus is equivalent to that to <b>diverted</b> <b>traffic</b> (the realized number of expressway users) only when demand curve has such a property that the marginal consumers' surplus to network expansion vanishes. In case that the marginal consumers' surplus does not vanish, the extrema of consumers' surplus is found in the regions of negative marginal <b>diverted</b> <b>traffic</b> if demand curve yields positive marginal surplus, and in the regions of the positive if it gives negative marginal surplus. The contact points of demand and average cost curves give extrema of neither consumers' surplus nor <b>diverted</b> <b>traffic.</b> An implicative finding, made out by Yamada by using a specific demand curve, that optimal network expansion is reached when the marginal service cost to expansion averaged to the marginal <b>diverted</b> <b>traffic</b> to expansion is equal to the value of time saved by using expressway just by mean trip length holds good at the points of the maximum <b>diverted</b> <b>traffic,</b> but not at the contacts of demand and average cost curves. In case of the demand curve, the condition for an equilibrium of revenues and cost to come into existence is that the minimum of the ratio of service cost averaged to the whole population of expressway users to the value of time mentioned above is {{less than or equal to}} e(- 1) ...|$|R
25|$|Over the years, the Stone Store {{suffered}} the cumulative effects of adjacent traffic movements and {{the ravages of}} normal wear and tear. Costly remedial work was required and {{in the 21st century}} a bypass was constructed and opened on 23 June 2008, to <b>divert</b> <b>traffic</b> and protect the building for posterity. The old stone store bridge was completely removed {{in the second half of}} 2008. The reasons for removal of the original bridge are controversial, and there was a groundswell of protest from a number of local residents. The bridge was removed regardless and the debate over whether this was the correct course of action has yet to be resolved in the minds of many residents. The building has been restored to its original state, but does not include the tower on the roof containing the clock removed from the chapel further up the hill, which was removed as a safety measure a long time ago.|$|E
25|$|In August 2010 a {{proposal}} was unveiled by then-Mayor Jerry Sanders and philanthropist Irwin M. Jacobs to <b>divert</b> <b>traffic</b> {{away from the}} central Prado areas of the park, such as the Plaza de Panama {{in front of the}} Art Museum and the California Quadrangle in front of the Museum of Man, and restore the areas to pedestrian use. The plan would provide replacement parking via a two-level parking garage {{at the site of the}} current Spreckles Organ Pavilion parking lot. The plan also called for changes in access to the park via the Cabrillo Bridge. The bridge would become one-way, eastbound only, so that people could enter the park via the Cabrillo Bridge but could exit only via Park Boulevard. Inbound traffic would be deflected via a new bridge offramp through the current Alcazar Gardens parking lot toward the new parking garage. The Alcazar Gardens parking lot would be for disabled parking only and for loading and unloading of passengers. The new parking garage would house 750–900 cars and would be landscaped on top. The plan became controversial because of its alteration to the appearance of the bridge and the possibility of charging for parking in the parking garage. In July 2012 the City Council voted to proceed with the Jacobs plan. Construction was due to begin in October 2012 and be completed in time for the park's centennial in 2015. However, the scheduled start of construction was pushed back to February 2013 due to a legal challenge from the Save Our Heritage Organization (SOHO). In February 2013 a judge voided the project, after which Jacobs withdrew his offer to finance it. Since the Park's master plan already called for removing the 67-space parking lot from the Plaza de Panama, the city went ahead with that portion of the proposal, removing all parking from the plaza and converting it into a pedestrian area with tree planters, seats, and tables.|$|E
500|$|Runcorn is {{situated}} on a spur projecting into the River Mersey, which flows {{to the north}} and then {{to the west of the}} town. On the north bank of the river is another spur forming the West Bank area of Widnes; together these form Runcorn Gap, a narrowing of the River Mersey. Runcorn Gap is crossed by the Runcorn Railway Bridge, which carries the Liverpool branch of the West Coast Main Line, and the Silver Jubilee Bridge, which carries the A533. To the south of the town is the River Weaver and the Weston Canal. Both open into the ship canal. To the southeast of the town run the M56 motorway, the Chester–Manchester railway line, and the main branch of the West Coast Main Line. The town has a system of [...] "expressways", roads designed to <b>divert</b> <b>traffic</b> away from the residential areas. The Central Expressway runs through the centre of the town in a north-south direction.

2500|$|Plans to {{construct}} a bypass of the village of Baldwinsville have existed in some form {{since at least the}} mid-1970s.

Several alignments of varying endpoints and length were considered by NYSDOT; however, all of the potential routes began south of Baldwinsville at NY690 and proceeded generally northeastward along the NY31 corridor to NY481 in the adjacent town of Clay. The 1988 New York Transportation Bond Act, dubbed [...] "Rebuild New York", provided funding for the design and planning stages of the project, and NYSDOT began gathering feedback on the project from the community in June 1991.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{more recent}} {{implementations}} of reversible lanes use a movable barrier {{to establish a}} physical separation between allowed and disallowed lanes of travel.
