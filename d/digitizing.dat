5|$|The {{design process}} {{involves}} trading-off different factors, including colour, contrast and overall disruptive effect. A failure {{to consider all}} elements of pattern design tends to result in poor results. The US Army's Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), for example, adopted after limited testing in 2003–4, performed poorly because of low pattern contrast ("isoluminance"—beyond very close range, the design looks like a field of solid light grey, failing to disrupt an object's outlines) and arbitrary colour selection, neither {{of which could be}} saved by quantizing (<b>digitizing)</b> the pattern geometry. The design was replaced from 2015 with Operational Camouflage Pattern, a non-pixellated pattern.|$|E
5|$|During {{the events}} of Halo 4, the Ur-Didact is accidentally {{released}} from his Cryptum by the Master Chief and Cortana. He immediately retakes control of the Prometheans, forms an alliance with the Storm Covenant, and attacks the UNSC Infinity. After being repelled, the Didact uses his ship, the Mantle's Approach, to retrieve the Composer from the UNSC Station Ivanoff in orbit around Halo Installation 03, followed by the Master Chief and Cortana. After retrieving the Composer, the Didact heads to Earth. Though {{he is able to}} fire the Composer at mid-west North America, <b>digitizing</b> over seven million people, the Chief and Cortana are able to destroy his ship and the Composer with a Havok nuclear warhead. Before his ship explodes, the Didact is incapacitated and falls into a slipspace portal underneath the Composer.|$|E
5|$|Kono {{described}} Clock Tower as {{an experimental}} project {{with a small}} budget and staff. His peers believed that a game where the protagonist runs away from the enemy would not work, but he continued on despite these concerns. Due to lack of staffing resources, developer Human Entertainment could not include mouse support and also needed to shrink the map down significantly. Although the graphics are two-dimensional, the mansion is designed within a 3D space. The character graphics in Clock Tower were created by <b>digitizing</b> photographs of real people, a popular technique of the time. The actress for Jennifer was a woman in Human's planning division. Many of the motions in the game came from her acting, such as hanging from a roof and stumbling in the hallway.|$|E

40|$|A pre-refereeing version {{submitted}} to DGCI 2017. Euclidean rotations in R^ 2 are bijective and isometric maps, but they lose generally these properties when <b>digitized</b> in discrete spaces. In particular, the topological and geometrical defects of <b>digitized</b> rigid motions {{on the square}} grid have been studied. In this context, the main problem {{is related to the}} incompatibility between the square grid and rotations; in general, one has to accept either relatively high loss of information or non-exactness of the applied <b>digitized</b> rigid motion. Motivated by these considerations, we study <b>digitized</b> rigid motions on the hexagonal grid. We establish a framework for studying <b>digitized</b> rigid motions in the hexagonal grid [...] -previously proposed for the square grid and known as neighborhood motion maps.

25|$|Digitized {{embroidery}} design files can {{be either}} purchased or created with industry-specific embroidery <b>digitizing</b> software. Embroidery file formats broadly fall into two categories. The first, source formats, are specific to the software used to create the design.

In this case, the files are available for use with particular embroidery machines and are not easily edited or scaled.|$|E
25|$|Integrated Land and Water Information System (ILWIS) is a {{geographic}} information system (GIS) and remote sensing software for both vector and raster processing.

25|$|Yet another {{limitation}} is in <b>digitizing</b> the inputs for the VII system. VII systems will probably continue to sense existing signs and roadway markings {{but one of}} the goals is to eliminate such signs and markings altogether.

Responsibility for this work would probably fall on the highway agencies which nearly all face difficulties in funding, manpower, and available time. Implementing and maintaining VII systems may therefore require support at the national level.|$|E

Eight orthopantomograms were photographed using a digital camera, Nikon Finepix S 7000, at four different resolution settings - 1 M pix, 3 M pix, 6 M pix and 12 M pix respectively. These thirty two digital images were transferred to a laptop computer, Acer Travelmate 290 E, saved as JPEG files and viewed using ′Planmeca Dimaxis′ software. Five observers made comparison between the film and <b>digitized</b> images and also amongst the images <b>digitized</b> with various pixel strengths.
