40|$|Abstract. The {{performances}} of centrifugal fans, two primary air fans and two secondary air fans {{were tested in}} BECR load and were compared with design parameters. The results show that air fan capacity excesses in practical BECR are 40 % and 80 %, beyond the design value. An operation optimization test offers the suggestions that keep inlet baffles completely open and regulate air fan loads only by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>couplers.</b> It earns about 20 A of the primary air fan di,o, where input voltage is 6000 V. The secondary air fan motor di,o changes from 2 - 27 A depending on the fan load. A driver upgrading prediction shows that the primary air fan di,u would have been over 75 A, and the primary air fan di,u would have been over 90 A, if the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>couplers</b> are substituted for variable-frequency drive...|$|R
2500|$|The {{most visible}} change to Herakles {{was a new}} {{wheelhouse}} installed {{on top of a}} cylindrical pillar housing a spiral staircase, [...] above the old superstructure. The original bridge was retained in full operating condition and could be used when the vessel was not pushing a barge. The forecastle was modified and strengthened to accept Articouple KD-350S <b>hydraulic</b> <b>couplers,</b> later installed in Turku Repair Yard, {{on both sides of the}} superstructure. Other changes included the removal of the towing winch and installation of a new auxiliary diesel generator, Caterpillar DITA 3512 producing , inside the former cargo hold aft of the superstructure to power the bow thruster of the barge. The propulsion gear was upgraded by installing new rudders, steering gear, Vulkan EZR elastic couplings, KaMeWa propeller blades and propeller ducts. The total cost of the conversion was FIM 10 million.|$|R
500|$|The unit {{is based}} on the Swedish X2 {{designed}} by Kalmar Verkstad in the 1980s, and delivered from 1990 to the Swedish State Railways for use in their X 2000 high-speed intercity trains. Although the technology involved is similar, like spot-welded stainless steel car bodies, the Class 71 differs in several ways. First, the unit does not have a separate locomotive unit, but has the motors spread throughout the train, with one powered and one unpowered bogie in each car. The car bodies are totally different in layout, including the doors between bogies instead of {{at the end of the}} cars. In addition, the trains are pressure tight to increase comfort for passengers while passing through tunnels. They also have <b>hydraulic</b> <b>couplers</b> at the ends, which are hidden behind covers when not used. The Class 71 is also shorter, with only three cars, and does not have any tilting technology installed. The exterior design, especially the nose, is quite different. Norges Statsbaner later took order of 22 units of the Class 73, that is almost identical, but has four cars and tilting technology. Class 73's pantograph is pivoted in order to keep it centred under the [...] catenary when the body tilts.|$|R

30|$|During {{the period}} of the ninth five-year {{national}} economic plan, with the cooperation of Zhangjiakou and Northwestern Coal Mining Equipment Manufactory, using CAD technology, the Taiyuan Branch of China Coal Research Institute developed the first scraper conveyors for LTCC face with retractable end chain adjusting device. They were the SGZ 960 / 750 front scraper conveyor and the SGZ 900 / 750 rear scraper conveyor, and also stage loader and crusher. The equipment developed met the requirements from Yankuang Group for a coal production of 10, 000 – 13, 000 t/d. During {{the period of}} the tenth five-year national economic plan, Yankuang Group, the Taiyuan Branch of China Coal Research Institute and Northwestern Benniu Group jointly developed the SGZ 1000 / 1200 and the SGZ 1200 / 1400 long distance high reliability front scraper conveyor and rear scraper conveyor. Currently, the SFZ 1200 / 1400 long distance high reliable rear scraper conveyor is an ultra-heavy scraper conveyor for LTCC faces, which is characterized by its highest power level, widest chute and longest length. Furthermore, it integrated various advanced technologies, including automatic extension of the conveyor end, hydraulic motor chain tensioner, speed adjustment <b>hydraulic</b> <b>coupler</b> and compact chain. In the 1990 s, its main specifications reached an advanced level accepted worldwide. The SGZ 1000 / 1200 front scraper conveyor is currently the largest front scraper conveyor, and can be integrated with various powerful shearers and hydraulic supports. Its installed power is 2  ×  600  kW. The development of the SGZ 1000 / 1200 and the SGZ 1200 / 1400 scraper conveyors enables not only the technical advance in scraper conveyor technology, but also in LTCC technology.|$|E
40|$|Several {{numerical}} {{investigations into}} {{the impact of the}} spear and nozzle configuration of impulse turbine injectors {{can be found in the}} literature, however there is little or no experimental data available for the effect on Turgo impulse turbine performance. A recent 2 D numerical Design of Experiments (DoE) study found that much steeper nozzle and spear angles than the industry standard produced higher efficiencies. This work was extended to compare the performance of an industry standard injector (with nozzle and spear angles of 80 ° and 55 °) and an improved injector with much steeper angles of 110 ° and 70 ° using a full 3 D simulation of the injector, guide vanes and first branch pipe. The impact of the jets produced by these injectors on the performance of a Turgo runner was also simulated. The results for both CFD tools used suggest that steeper injector nozzle and spear angles reduce the injector losses, showing an increase in efficiency of 0. 76 % for the Turgo 3 D injector. In order to investigate the numerical results from the previous studies further, three Turgo impulse turbine injectors were manufactured by Gilbert Gilkes & Gordon Ltd for testing on the 9 ” Gilkes HCTI Turgo rig at the Laboratory of Hydraulic Machines, National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). The injector designs tested were the standard (80 / 55) design, with nozzle and spear tip angles of 80 ° and 55 ° and the Novel 1 design (110 / 70) with nozzle and spear tip angles of 110 ° and 70 ° based on previously published CFD optimisation studies. The optimisations in the previous studies showed that the nozzle and spear angles in the upper limit of the investigated test plan, which was much higher than current industry guidelines, gave higher efficiencies. The DoE response surfaces in that study suggested that the optimum nozzle and spear angles may be even steeper and therefore an additional, third design (Novel 2) with even steeper angles (150 / 90) was also manufactured and tested. This paper presents the experimental data obtained for the three injector designs which were tested in a Turgo model turbine at various rotating speeds and flow rates. The 70 kW Turgo was coupled to a 75 kW DC generator which allowed continuous speed regulation. The inlet conditions into the Turgo model turbine were controlled by a high head adjustable speed multistage pump of nominal operation point Q= 290 m 3 /h, H= 130 m (coupled via a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>coupler</b> to a 200 kW induction motor) which pumped water from the 320 m 3 main reservoir of the Lab. The tests were carried out in single jet and twin jet operation. Testing and calibration of all the sensors was carried out according to testing standard IEC 60193 Hydraulic turbines, storage pumps and pump-turbines – Model acceptance tests (IEC 60193 : 1999). The results show that the Novel 2 injector performs best overall, which is consistent with the results obtained in previous 2 D injector simulations. The achieved turbine efficiency with this injector is of the order of 0. 5 - 1 % higher than the Standard design, for both single and twin jet operation. The Novel 1 injector’s performance is between the Standard and Novel 2 injectors overall. Some images of the jets were also taken at various openings and are presented to qualitatively analyse the impact of each injector design on the disturbances on the outside of the jet. A further 2 D axisymmetric CFD analysis is carried out to validate the measurements and to analyse the mechanisms which lead to injector losses. The results found that the majority of the losses occur in the region just upstream of the nozzle exit, where the static pressure is converted into dynamic pressure and the flow accelerates. In the Standard design, this conversion begins sooner and the flow travels over a longer distance at higher velocities leading to an increase in the losses. The CFD results found the differences between the designs to be smaller than the experiments however the trend of the results was similar, suggesting that the steeper angle injectors achieve higher efficiencies and better jet quality. The next stage of this research is to carry out a CFD analysis of the three injector designs in 3 D, including the guide vanes and branch pipes, to investigate the impact of the steeper angles on the secondary velocities within the jet and the impact this has on the runner performance...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} to achieve stable and uniform uniaxial compression is offered for creep testing of advanced ceramic materials at elevated temperatures, using an innovative self-aligning load-train assembly. Excellent load-train alignment {{is attributed to}} the inherent ability of a unique <b>hydraulic</b> universal <b>coupler</b> to maintain self-aligning. Details of key elements, design concept, and pricniples of operation of the self-aligning coupler are described. A method of alignment verification using a strain-gaged specimen is then discussed. Results of verification tests indicate that bending below 1. 5 % is routinely achievable usin the load-train system. A successful compression creep test is demonstrated using a dumbbell-shpaed Si nitride specimen tested at 1300 C for over 4000 h...|$|R
40|$|BP Norway is {{well versed}} in well {{intervention}} from fixed platforms. The present Skarv field development will however require future subsea well interventions to take place from different floating vessels. BP has extensive experience from subsea fields outside of Norway, and {{it is necessary to}} ensure that the planning and preparations for such activities in Norway are fully up to speed with company competence. This thesis seeks to act as reference work for anyone interested in learning about subsea well intervention in BP Norway, but should not be mistaken for purely theoretical work. The overall goal is to assess how future subsea well intervention operations on Skarv can be performed, optimised and incorporate all BP learning from previous operations in the North Sea, thus contribute to increased hydrocarbon recovery from the Norwegian continental shelf. In order to properly prepare the well intervention department and management systems for the coming challenges, a broad definition of subsea intervention practices, technology and experiences have been described. Subsea wells are expensive to intervene with conventional rigs so the more cost-effective Light Well Intervention (LWI) alternative has been selected as a focus area. Even LWI vessels are expensive machinery so malpractices during operational execution may compromise the good economics of well interventions. The in depth study is focused on experienced unplanned events causing delays or non-productive time (NPT) during operations and thereby reducing operational efficiency. A powerful tool to increase the operation factor (uptime vs. downtime) and economics of subsea interventions is to proactively apply risk management techniques, hence this subject is also incorporated in the in depth study. The thesis is operationally orientated and a wide range of real data has been analysed, including but not limited to operational daily reports, end of well reports, after action reviews, risk assessments, operational guidelines, procedures, practices and investigation reports. The BP advisory team was consistently involved in the process and in addition to analysing documents, expert interviews were conducted. The analysis is by reasoning of the above concentrated on all operations conducted from the three LWI vessels BP had in operation in the North Sea in the time period 2009 - 2011. One of the most important findings is that around 80 % of all lessons learnt stems from ?Planning?, ?Equipment? or ?Operations?, suggesting this should be the main arena for organisational learning focus and future improvement efforts. Among a number of comparable reports, the following example from the LWI vessel Island Constructor operating on the Devenick field in 2011 has helped in narrowing down one of the key causes behind the high number of incidents within the ?Equipment? and ?Operations? categories to interface clashes: ?Unable to land off tree running tool on the subsea tree due to interface issues between the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>couplers.</b> Various attempts to land the tree running tool anyway lead to wear on equipment and 3 coupler shrouds came free. ? Several similar underlying causes have been identified based on commonalities found when cross referencing all the subsea intervention operational lessons for different phases including ?Planning?, ?Rig Up?, ?Personnel?, ?Communication? and ?Miscellaneous? in addition to the above mentioned categories. Some of the documented lessons learnt are repeated at other vessels later in time, questioning the ability to actually benefit from recording these lessons. A recommended risk assessment template has been established in order to assist focus for future planning of similar operations in Norwegian waters. Implementation of the template will improve operational efficiency, reduce unwanted downtime and make BP among the ?best in class? when it comes to practical risk management and organisational learning within subsea LWI operations. Further work should be done to include an even more comprehensive data study to uncover trends that might have gone under the radar. Further work should also focus on providing an effective permanent organisational learning platform to ensure unwanted events do not repeat themselves and that all relevant lessons learnt are indeed incorporated in future operations {{to be able to take}} full advantage of previous successes and failures. All BP experiences should be gathered and processed to get a total experience and risk data bank for these operations. Recommended measures from the risk register should be transformed to updated programmes and procedures. Further work should also seek implementation of the new recommended risk register approach proposed in this thesis for subsea well interventions in the BP organisation...|$|R
