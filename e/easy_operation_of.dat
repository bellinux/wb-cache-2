The low cost and <b>easy</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the diffusive sampling technique makes it an ideal tool for large scale air pollution surveys with a high spatial resolution. Finally, we used Kriging method to draw air pollutions maps related to NO 2 and SO 2 measurements in Shiraz city. These maps conducted us to find number of air pollution monitoring stations. Results show that we need 2 traffic, 3 urban, 1 suburban and 1 industrial station in Shiraz area. In fact, the proposed method in this study provides a useful tool that can be easily applied to other polluted cities.

This method was devised to realize <b>easy</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the twin roll casting and increase of casting speed. Findings: are that 400 -width-strip of 3084, 5182 and 6022 could be cast at speed of 20 m/min. This strip wasabout 4 mm-thick. There were some defects on the surface. As cast strip could be cold-rolled down to sheetof 1 mm-thick. 180 degrees bending test was operated on the 6022 sheet after T 4 heat treatment. Crack did notoccurred at the outer surface when strip was bent at width-direction.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Heat Flow Meter (HFM) Apparatus (ASTM C 518) {{can be an}} ex-tremely {{versatile}} {{test instrument}} used {{in a wide variety}} of conditions. Two special design HFM apparatuses are described here. They are Vacuum-Cryogenic and High Temperature (600 &deg;C) Heat Flow Meters. Calibration technique is the main key to obtaining useful information from testing under these unusual conditions. A few standards are available for use in these areas, however, others must be generated from Guarded Hot Plate (ASTM C 177) tests under similar conditions. Mathematical modeling and statistical regression methods are employed to obtain calibration equa-tions in order to calculate the coefficient or sensitivity under a variety of test condi-tions. Error analysis is used to estimate the uncertainty of these test measurements which is usually greater than under standard conditions. These types of calibration methods have proven to be viable and useful for many years at the Manville-Schuller Mountain Technical Center thermal test labs. This allows the use of HFMs in testing conditions traditionally reserved for Guarded Hot Plates. The lower cost, simpler design, and <b>easier</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the HFM apparatus are significant advantages...|$|R

30|$|From Q 1 to Q 4 {{which were}} asked to {{evaluate}} the usefulness of ROS for executing the learning tasks regarding the requirements {{as described in the}} previous section, we concluded: Firstly, all participants considered ROS more helpful for their searching for related web pages. According to the reasons written down by some of them, we can conclude that the ROS’s resource map was playing a positive role in this procedure, and the two screens for displaying resource map and the actual web page, pointed out by 3 participants, were helpful also. Secondly, all participants consider ROS more helpful when saving the links they found useful. Some participants noted that it was due to the <b>easy</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> dragging and dropping nodes from resource map that facilitated the number of links stored using ROS surpassed that of using IE. Meanwhile, as a participant pointed out that the compulsive operation of creating topics and building connections among them made their search more targeted. Thirdly, 15 participants considered ROS more helpful when reading pages for keyword drawing. The reasons for this choice, according to some participants’ comments, were for the structure of learning topics whose connections were built by themselves previously presented by ROS’s personal topic maps. As a participant stated: “When I looked at the personal topic maps, I can recall the reasons for adding these learning resources to the topics and also be reminded of the relationships among all the learning topics I had created. This helped a lot when {{trying to figure out the}} contents of the web pages, making the drawing keyword map easier.” However, only one participant found it similar whether using ROS or IE, the reason for this was that he/she did not find it more convenient reading pages from personal topic maps than IE’s favorite list as both needed them to selectively read through for keywords. Finally, all participants considered ROS more helpful when reading pages in community-based learning resources for adding keywords to their keyword maps. For those who had written down the reasons for this choice, they attributed their better performance using ROS to the clearer representation of topics and learning resources of the community map.|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy of the University of LutonThe research presented in this thesis describes the development and application of a portable, high-resolution instrument, specifically designed for the at-site monitoring of algae and cyanobacteria in freshwaters. The instrument incorporates a miniature charge-coupled device (CCD) based spectrometer and a low power combined deutelium and tungsten light source, enabling the absorbance to be measured between 200 - 850 nm at a resolution of 1. 3 nm. A transmission dip probe with removable tips of 5, 10 and 40 mm pathlengths forms the sampling device. A specifically developed control program allows <b>easy</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the instrument. A linear response from 0. 0 - 1. 2 AU and a combined {{signal to noise ratio}} of 576 : 1 for the instrument components resulting in a high baseline stability of 1. 0 mAU drift over five hundred measurements being observed. The instrument provides in-vivo absorbance characteristics with high resolution across the visible spectrum. Up to twelve specific spectral features were commonly identified in the absorbance spectra of algae and cyanobacteria between 400 - 750 nm. Individual spectral features were linked to specific pigments, some of which were found to be taxonomically distinct. Fourth derivative analysis was proven to provide further enhancement of subtle spectral features. The instrument has a linear range for chlorophyll a up to 1000 !lg rl and a detection limit of 8) lg rl using the 40 mm pathlength probe. Physiological adaptation to light and nutrient conditions were shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the in-vivo absorbance spectrum, therefore providing potential information on physiological status and health of a natural sample. Spectral analysis using principal component analysis (PCA) with classification based on the soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) method was used to classify nine species from three taxonomic classes, including four cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa, Anabaena variabilis, Aphanizornenon flos-aquae, Synechnococcus sp.), four chlorophyceae (Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus acuminatus, Spirogyra mirabilis, Staurastrurn chaetoceros) and a single bacillariophyceae (Asterionella Formosa). Classification using the SIMCA method proved to be highly reliable and robust. Moreover, the addition of noise was found to have very little effect on the classification. Under laboratory conditions all nine species were correctly classified using 'unknown' spectra. At-site classification of natural samples and laboratory simulations have shown the robustness and reliability of the developed portable instrument. In combination with the data analysis techniques, the instrument is well suited to the proactive at-site assessment of algal and cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic freshwater environments...|$|E
