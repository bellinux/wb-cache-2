25|$|Garuda Vyuha is worshiped in Tantra for Abhichara and {{to protect}} against Abhichara. However, the <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that Garuda is the Sankarshna form of the lord who during {{creation}} primarily possesses the knowledge aspect of the lord (among Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha forms). The {{important point is that}} Garuda represents the five vayus within us : prana, apana, vyana, udana, samana through his five forms Satya, Suparna, Garuda, Tarkshya, Vihageshwara. These five vayus through yoga can be controlled through Pranayama which can lead to Kundalini awakening leading to higher levels of consciousness.|$|E
500|$|While widely {{considered}} to be a pop punk band, Fall Out Boy has also been described as pop rock emo, and emo pop, and cites emo group The Get Up Kids as an influence among many other bands. When interviewed for a retrospective article in Alternative Press at the time The Get Up Kids disbanded in 2005, Pete Wentz stated that [...] "Fall Out Boy would not be a band {{if it were not for}} The Get Up Kids." [...] Early in the band's career, when Jared Logan was producing the group's debut album, he asked bassist Pete Wentz what sound the band desired for recording. Wentz responded by [...] "handing over the first two New Found Glory records". Wentz also cites Green Day, the Ramones, Screeching Weasel, Metallica, Earth Crisis, Gorilla Biscuits and Lifetime as influences. The band acknowledges its hardcore punk roots as an influence; all four members were involved in the Chicago hardcore scene before joining Fall Out Boy. Wentz described the band's affiliation with the genre by saying [...] "I think the <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that we are all hardcore kids that are writing pop music...It gives us a different style because at our core we are always hardcore. That aspect is always going to be evident in the music. We are hardcore kids that couldn't quite cut it as hardcore kids." [...] He referred to Fall Out Boy's genre as [...] "softcore": hardcore punk mixed with pop sensibility. Lead singer Patrick Stump, however, is also influenced by artists he listened to while growing up including Prince, Michael Jackson, and David Bowie.|$|E
2500|$|Under Thomas, {{the site}} became known for {{unsubstantiated}} gossip and [...] "linkbait", or stories whose substance lay solely in the title, {{making it a}} tempting link for other on-line sites but that effectively only [...] "baited" [...] traffic to Valleywag. A small-but-influential tech website hosted by Y Combinator, Hacker News, banned stories from Valleywag. Y Combinator founder Paul Graham wrote “Several users have suggested we ban Valleywag, not for anything in particular that they write about, but because their articles are always such deliberate linkbait. I personally agree. In 99% of Valleywag articles, the most <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> the title.” [...] Sixty percent of Hacker News readers voted yes to the ban.|$|E

2500|$|AllMusic's Heather Phares {{scored the}} soundtrack 3 out of 5, writing [...] "True Crime is {{something}} of an achievement when it comes to gathering popular music in support of a video game." [...] She concluded [...] "It's not a perfect soundtrack, but True Crime is entertaining enough to please gaming and non-gaming rap fans alike." [...] IGN's Spence D scored the soundtrack 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "Where The Streets of LA: The Soundtrack really succeeds is {{in the fact that the}} 20 track album features all new material written specifically for the game." [...] He concluded [...] "The most <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that for all intents and purposes the West Coast gangsta scene, musically speaking, has more or less run its course, succumbing to the bling and blitz of the Dirty South. But this album proves that it's still alive and well. Whatever your take on the gunz-n-thugs mentality may be, one thing can't be denied: the 20 tracks included here are rife with game, style, and serious funktafication." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One more <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> {{done with}} sponges, {{and this is}} when doctors put ether on it, and hold it to people's noses when they have teeth out. I shall do this when I am bigger, and give ether to the sick, so {{they will go to}} sleep and not feel me cut off their legs and arms." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{the next}} most <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to sit and listen to these Gentiles talk about polygamy; and how some portly old frog of an elder, or a bishop, marries a girl--likes her, marries her sister--likes her, marries another sister--likes her, takes another--likes her, marries her mother--likes her, marries her father, grandfather, great grandfather, and then comes back hungry and asks for more. And how the pert young thing of eleven will chance to be the {{favorite}} wife and her own venerable grandmother have to rank away down toward D 4 in their mutual husband's esteem, and have {{to sleep in the}} kitchen, as like as not. And how this dreadful sort of thing, this hiving together in one foul nest of mother and daughters, and the making a young daughter superior to her own mother in rank and authority, are things which Mormon women submit to because their religion teaches them that the more wives a man has on earth, and the more children he rears, the higher the place they will all have in the world to come--and the warmer, maybe, though they do not seem to say anything about that.|$|E
5000|$|While commenting {{over the}} song to Billboards Kenneth Partridge, {{producer}} Jimmy Jam claimed that, [...] "At {{the time we}} did it, {{it was one of}} my favorite songs.

60|$|Many <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> {{to be seen}} in the Room of Magic, {{including}} {{much that}} had been stolen from the Adepts when they were transformed to fishes, but they had to admit that Coo-ee-oh had a rare genius for mechanics, and had used her knowledge in inventing a lot of mechanical apparatus that ordinary witches, wizards and sorcerers could not understand.|$|R

6000|$|Now {{it is an}} irritating and pathetic {{thing that}} the three most popular phrases about Shaw are false. Modern criticism, like all weak things, is {{overloaded}} with words. In a healthy condition of language a man finds {{it very difficult to}} say the right thing, but at last says it. In this empire of journalese a man finds it so very easy to say the wrong thing that he never thinks of saying anything else. False or meaningless phrases lie so ready to his hand that it is easier to use them than not to use them. These wrong terms picked up through idleness are retained through habit, and so the man has begun to think wrong almost before he has begun to think at all. Such lumbering logomachy is always injurious and oppressive to men of spirit, imagination or intellectual honour, and it has dealt very recklessly and wrongly with Bernard Shaw. He has contrived to get about three newspaper phrases tied to his tail; and those newspaper phrases are all and separately wrong. The three superstitions about him, it will be conceded, are generally these: first that he desires [...] "problem plays," [...] second that he is [...] "paradoxical," [...] and third that in his dramas as elsewhere he is specially [...] "a Socialist." [...] And the <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that when we come to his philosophy, all these three phrases are quite peculiarly inapplicable.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{said that}} Paganism is a {{religion}} of joy and Christianity of sorrow; {{it would be just}} as easy to prove that Paganism is pure sorrow and Christianity pure joy. Such conflicts mean nothing and lead nowhere. Everything human must have in it both joy and sorrow; the only matter of interest is {{the manner in which the}} two things are balanced or divided. And the really <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> this, that the pagan was (in the main) happier and happier as he approached the earth, but sadder and sadder as he approached the heavens. The gaiety of the best Paganism, as in the playfulness of Catullus or Theocritus, is, indeed, an eternal gaiety never to be forgotten by a grateful humanity. But it is all a gaiety about the facts of life, not about its origin. To the pagan the small things are as sweet as the small brooks breaking out of the mountain; but the broad things are as bitter as the sea. When the pagan looks at the very core of the cosmos he is struck cold. Behind the gods, who are merely despotic, sit the fates, who are deadly. Nay, the fates are worse than deadly; they are dead. And when rationalists say that the ancient world was more enlightened than the Christian, from their point of view they are right. For when they say [...] "enlightened" [...] they mean darkened with incurable despair. It is profoundly true that the ancient world was more modern than the Christian. The common bond is in the fact that ancients and moderns have both been miserable about existence, about everything, while mediaevals were happy about that at least. I freely grant that the pagans, like the moderns, were only miserable about everything--they were quite jolly about everything else. I concede that the Christians of the Middle Ages were only at peace about everything--they were at war about everything else. But if the question turn on the primary pivot of the cosmos, then there was more cosmic contentment in the narrow and bloody streets of Florence than in the theatre of Athens or the open garden of Epicurus. Giotto lived in a gloomier town than Euripides, but he lived in a gayer universe.|$|E

5000|$|The {{songs that}} you write when you're young {{are just a}} part of you—they stay with you.

So, coming back and stripping them down and trying to revisit them in a kind of honest, genuine fashion was actually—even for an old cynic like me—it turned to be a very moving thing ...

50|$|During {{the period}} of the {{assignment}} of the young preachers are usually not allowed to go home parent. Mental far they were prepared to get used to your parents and be independent.

The conference was also an opportunity for young researchers to meet new colleagues and exchange their views. The interest was very big since only 40 percent of the applicants <b>were</b> accepted.
