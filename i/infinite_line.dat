The method by which they were designed was called the image parameter method and filters designed to this method are called image filters. The image method essentially consists of developing the transmission constants of an infinite chain of identical filter sections and then terminating the desired finite number of filter sections in the image impedance. This exactly corresponds {{to the way the}} properties of a finite length of transmission line are derived from the theoretical properties of an <b>infinite</b> <b>line,</b> the image impedance corresponding to the characteristic impedance of the line.|$|E

60|$|To explain:—Grant the {{abstract}} tendency {{of any one}} atom to any one other as the inevitable result of diffusion from the normal Unity:—or, what is the same thing, admit any given atom as proposing to move in any given direction—it is clear that, since there is an infinity of atoms {{on all sides of}} the atom proposing to move, it never can actually move toward the satisfaction of its tendency in the direction given, on account of a precisely equal and counterbalancing tendency in the direction diametrically opposite. In other words, exactly as many tendencies to Unity are behind the hesitating atom as before it; for it is a mere sotticism to say that one <b>infinite</b> <b>line</b> is longer or shorter than another <b>infinite</b> <b>line,</b> or that one infinite number is greater or less than another number that is infinite. Thus the atom in question must remain stationary forever. Under the impossible circumstances which we have been merely endeavoring to conceive for argument’s sake, there could have been no aggregation of Matter—no stars—no worlds—nothing but a perpetually atomic and inconsequential Universe. In fact, view it as we will, the whole idea of unlimited Matter is not only untenable, but impossible and preposterous.|$|E

40|$|A prior work (see Chapter 8 of the book, ``Graphs and Networks: Transfinite and Nonstandard,'' Birkhauser-Boston, Cambridge, Mass., USA, 2004) {{examined}} {{the propagation of}} an electromagnetic wave on a transfinite transmission line, transfinite {{in the sense that}} infinitely many one-way <b>infinite</b> transmission <b>lines</b> are connected in cascade. That there are infinitely many such one-way <b>infinite</b> <b>lines</b> results in the wave propagating without ever reflecting at some discontinuity. The present work examines the cascade where the cascade terminates after only finitely many one-way <b>infinite</b> transmission <b>lines,</b> with the result that reflected waves are now produced at both the far end {{as well as at the}} initial end of the transfinite transmission line. The question of whether the reflected waves are infini tesimal or appreciable and whether they sum to an infinitesimal or appreciable amount are resolved for both distortionless and lossless lines.
