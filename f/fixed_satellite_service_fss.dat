30|$|In {{the context}} of SatComs, multibeam joint {{processing}} scenarios have been studied in various settings. Specifically, the FL case has been examined in [26 – 33]. Various characteristics of the multibeam satellite channel were taken into account such as beam gain [28, 29, 34], rain fading [30], interference matrix [29] and correlated attenuation areas [28]. Joint processing studies concerning the FL of SatCom systems usually assume fixed users. This assumption originates from the difficulties in acquiring reliable and up to date CSI for the FL of satellite systems. During the CSI acquisition process, the pilot signals need to be broadcasted to the users and then fed back to the transmitter, thus doubling {{the effect of the}} long propagation delay of the satellite channel and rendering the acquired CSI outdated.

As a result, in a suburban MIMO-OFDM LOS scenario, IMT-Advanced base station can provide sufficient coverage to relay station using our developed algorithm because most links from base station to relay station have LOS environment and are free from restriction of antenna spacing.

40|$|Abstract—For <b>fixed</b> <b>satellite</b> <b>services</b> (<b>FSS)</b> the {{performance}} of a single carrier- frequency domain equalizer (SC-FDE) MIMO system concept for line of sight (LOS) MIMO satellite channels is evaluated for the case of orthogonal and nearly orthogonal channels. The channel orthogonality is achieved by adjusting the phase angles within the channel transfer matrix through the LOS path distance which the signals have to travel between the respective transmit-receive antenna pair. This strategy finally leads to locally specific antenna arrangements needed for orthogonal channels with identical eigenmodes and maximum spatial multiplexing gain. For this particular type of channel a system has recently been proposed which revealed a very good performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) and mutual information. However, once the MIMO system has been optimized this way, practical impairments such as movements and maneuvers of the satellite or imperfect antenna arrangements of the user terminals might again cause a violation of the channel orthogonality. In this case the system performance suffers from spatial co-channel interference between the MIMO signal streams, which after all reduces the achievable throughput. This is analyzed and quantified in the paper for a typical scenario, and improvement potential is revealed by the application of a V-BLAST successive interference cancelation (SIC) scheme together with zero-forcing channel equalization.

Spectrum sharing is an effective way of allowing new services to operate without cancelling the existing allocations in the same part of the spectrum. The use of spectrum sharing results in re-use of the available spectrum among different services and, therefore, increases the efficient use of the radio frequencies. However, {{it is necessary to}} carry out extensive feasibility studies into technical or operational compatibility between the services involved. Often, sharing constraints are placed on systems, such as the power of emissions and the transmitter and receiver antenna pointings to reduce the interference into negligible levels. Traditionally, radio spectrum allocated to GSO FSS has been shared with FS. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of low Earth orbits and a number of NGSO FSS constellations has been designed to provide broadband data services. This has led to the allocation of certain bands used by the FS and GSO FSS systems to NGSO FSS. In line with the new allocations, NGSO FSS, GSO FSS and FS systems are required to co-exist in parts of the 12 to 30 GHz frequency range.
