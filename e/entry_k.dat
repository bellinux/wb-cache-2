Provided we have the first row and the first entry in a row numbered 0, the answer will be located at <b>entry</b> <b>k</b> in row n.

40|$|In {{the last}} note, we solve a system S by {{transforming}} it into another equivalent easy–to–solve system, say S ′. But {{what is the}} meaning of the so call easy–to–solve system? We suggest that systems with the augmented matrices in echelon form or even reduced echelon form are easy to solve. In order to enable us to analyze any system of linear equations, we will refine the method in the last section into a row reduction algorithm. This would make our operation more principled. Basic concept: leading <b>entry</b> (<b>k),</b> (row) echelon form (F/), echelon matrix (F/Ý), reduced (row) echelon form ({zF/), reduced (row) echelon matrix ({zF/Ý), pivot position (Ì  ) 2 Echelon Form (F/) Definition 1 (leading entry(k)). Let A be an m × n matrix (m rows and n columns). The leftmost nonzero entry () of the i–th row of A {{is said to be the}} leading entry of the i–th row of A and denote the column position/index of this entry in the i–th row by LP rowi (A). If all the entries of the i–th row are zero (zero row) then define LP rowi (A) : = n + i. Example: 1 − 2 1 00 0 0...|$|E
40|$|Taylor {{presented}} an explicit resolution for arbitrary monomial ideals. Later, Lyubeznik found that already a subcomplex defines a resolution. We {{show that the}} Taylor resolution may be obtained by repeated applica-tion of the Schreyer Theorem from the theory of Gröbner bases, whereas the Lyubeznik resolution {{is a consequence of}} Buchberger’s chain criterion. Finally, we relate Fröberg’s contracting homotopy for the Taylor complex to normal forms with respect to our Gröbner bases and use it to derive a splitting homotopy that leads to the Lyubeznik complex. 1. The Taylor and the Lyubeznik Resolution LetM = {m 1, [...] .,mr} ⊂ P = k[x 1, [...] ., xn] be a finite set of monomials. Taylor [1960] constructed in her Ph. D. thesis an explicit free resolution of the monomial ideal J = 〈M〉. The associated complex consists essentially of an exterior alge-bra and a differential defined via the least common multiples of subsets of M. Let V be some r-dimensional k-vector space with the basis {v 1, [...] ., vr}. If k = (k 1, [...] ., kq) is a sequence of integers with 1 ≤ k 1 < k 2 < · · · < kq ≤ r, we set mk = lcm(mk 1, [...] .,mkq). The P-module Tq = P ⊗ ΛqV is then freely generated by all wedge products vk = vk 1 ∧ · · · ∧ vkq. Finally, we introduce on the algebra T = P ⊗ ΛV the following P-linear differential δ: δvk = q∑ `= 1 (− 1) `− 1 mk mk` vk `, (1) where k ` denotes the sequence k with the <b>entry</b> <b>k</b> ` removed. Obviously, the differ-ential δ respects the grading of T by the form degree, as it maps the component Tq into Tq− 1 (however, in general δ does not respect the natural bigrading of T given by Trq = Pr ⊗ ΛqV). ...|$|E
