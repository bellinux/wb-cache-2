5|$|Judging {{that both}} {{national}} governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems {{that go beyond}} the capacity of individual nation-states to solve, some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C. Partridge, argue that regionalism will be the major force in the coming decades, pockets of power around regional centers: Western Europe around Brussels, the Western Hemisphere around Washington, D.C., East Asia around Beijing, and Eastern Europe around Moscow. As such, the E.U., the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the G-20 will likely become more influential as time progresses. The question then is not whether <b>global</b> <b>governance</b> is gradually emerging, but rather how will these regional powers interact with one another.|$|E

40|$|On the {{one hand}} <b>global</b> water <b>governance</b> {{is one of the}} most active policy fields in the realm of {{sustainable}} development, while the global water crisis and its phenomena are reasonably well understood. On the other hand <b>global</b> water <b>governance</b> still lacks institutionalization and is often referred to as,diffuse‘ and,fragmented‘. Furthermore, the scientific community has added only little to a better understanding of <b>global</b> water <b>governance,</b> so that it can be seen as a,blind spot‘ in the governance research agenda. That is the challenge addressed by this thesis. In its,applied mode‘ the thesis proves the presumption of its author; namely that the characterization of <b>global</b> water <b>governance</b> as,diffuse‘ and ultimately,ineffective‘ runs at least in part counter to the reality of <b>global</b> water <b>governance</b> of the past 30 years. In order to analyze the global dimension of water governance, regime theory will be used as the analytical framework. Describing <b>global</b> water <b>governance</b> as a <b>global</b> water regime allows new light to be shed on this policy field and to understand it as, by and large, a coordinated collective effort addressing the looming global water crisis. Hence, this dissertation may lead to a revaluation of <b>global</b> water <b>governance</b> by the (water) governance research community, as well as providing advice for practitioners dealing with future institutionalization processes in <b>global</b> water <b>governance.</b> The overarching scientific interest relates to a better understanding and explanation of institution and regime building processes in <b>global</b> water <b>governance.</b> A normative-ethical foundation for the role of institutions is briefly presented, too. The thesis then continues with its main research question: Is current <b>global</b> water <b>governance</b> already a <b>global</b> water regime as defined by regime theory? The final answer to this question depends on the theoretical understanding and conceptualization of regimes. If a,classic‘ understanding of regimes is employed – one that refers to legally binding regulatory institutional arrangements between nation states – the answer may be negative. However, if the regime framing can address,soft law‘, other actors than the nation state (while not dismissing the nation state), as well as regime functions other than regulation, a positive answer should be expected. The dissertation accordingly establishes this. In order to address its fundamental research question, the dissertation thoroughly reconstructs the genesis of <b>global</b> water <b>governance</b> over the past 30 years. Besides the incorporation of insights from governance research of the past 20 years, the dissertation develops and applies an integrative theory of regime formation, building on recent developments in regime theory, that allows for a logically coherent application of different,schools of thoughts‘ in regime theory in order to better understand and explain <b>global</b> water <b>governance</b> as a process of regime formation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. UN–Water was {{established}} in 2003 to coordinate United Nations activities on water. There have been no scientific assessments about this coordination mechanism and, hence, {{we focus on the}} role of UN–Water in <b>global</b> water <b>governance.</b> We use an analytical framework to conceptualize relevant natural and social phenomena, actors, and institutions in the field of <b>global</b> water <b>governance.</b> This framework ultimately allows an assessment of UN–Water’s role in this field. Our work draws upon official UN–Water documents, a formal external review of UN–Water, and semistructured expert interviews to assess UN– Water’s influence on global water discourses, particularly on the discourses of water and climate change, and integrated water resources management. This helps to identify UN–Water’s specific functions in the field of <b>global</b> water <b>governance.</b> The mechanism acts as a bridge between the expert-centered background and the political foreground of <b>global</b> water <b>governance.</b> Key Words: <b>global</b> water <b>governance</b> (GWG); integrated water resources management (IWRM); UN–Water; water and climate chang...|$|R

40|$|Background: Global constitutionalism {{is a way}} {{of looking}} at the world, at global rules and how they are made, as if there was a global constitution, {{empowering}} global institutions to act as a global government, setting rules which bind all states and people. Analysis: This essay employs global constitutionalism to examine how and why <b>global</b> health <b>governance,</b> as currently structured, has struggled to advance the right to health, a fundamental human rights obligation enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It first examines the core structure of the <b>global</b> health <b>governance</b> architecture, and its evolution since the Second World War. Second, it identifies the main constitutionalist principles that are relevant for a global constitutionalism assessment of the core structure of the <b>global</b> health <b>governance</b> architecture. Finally, it applies these constitutionalist principles to assess the core structure of the <b>global</b> health <b>governance</b> architecture. Discussion: Leading global health institutions are structurally skewed to preserve high incomes countries' disproportionate influence on transnational rule-making authority, and tend to prioritise infectious disease control over the comprehensive realisation of the right to health. Conclusion: A Framework Convention on Global Health could create a classic division of powers in <b>global</b> health <b>governance,</b> with WHO as the law-making power in <b>global</b> health <b>governance,</b> a <b>global</b> fund for health as the executive power, and the International Court of Justice as the judiciary power...|$|R
40|$|This study {{critically}} {{examines the}} ideas of cosmopolitan liberalism and <b>global</b> liberal <b>governance</b> in relation to new forms of political violence. Cosmopolitan liberal framework appears problematic {{in terms of its}} appeal for universal humanism which makes the approach outdated and naïve. <b>Global</b> liberal <b>governance</b> uses humanitarian argumentation to legitimise its hidden agendas seeking to establish the liberal rule where it sees opportunities. <b>Global</b> liberal <b>governance</b> produces security for those it considers to be worth securing, and thus is far less noble than it is often apprehended to be. During the past couple of decades the nature of political violence has taken new forms and become more complex. The One Child Policy (OCP) in China and human trafficking in general are problems of the new millennium which are unapproachable through cosmopolitan liberal framework and unappealing for <b>global</b> liberal <b>governance.</b> This study illustrates how these forms of new political violence have a capacity to accumulate to new genocides, and in case of China already has. The case of China clearly illustrates how some violations of human rights are left unrecognised as they appear unappealing to <b>global</b> liberal <b>governance,</b> whereas on other cases the liberal regime is willing to use the humanitarianism to justify intervention. Hence, the aim {{of this study is to}} develop critical apprehension of <b>global</b> liberal <b>governance</b> and its relation to new political violence, and thus reveal power structures behind them...|$|R

500|$|The Green party {{politician}} Bob Brown (who {{was arrested}} by the Tasmanian state police for a conscientious act of civil disobedience during the Franklin Dam protest) expresses world conscience in these terms: [...] "the universe, through us, is evolving towards experiencing, understanding and making choices about its future'; one example of policy outcomes from such thinking being a global tax (see Tobin tax) to alleviate global poverty and protect the biosphere, amounting to 1/10 of 1% placed on the worldwide speculative currency market. Such an approach sees world conscience best expressing itself through political reforms promoting democratically based globalisation or planetary democracy (for example internet voting for <b>global</b> <b>governance</b> organisations (see world government) based {{on the model of}} [...] "one person, one vote, one value") which gradually will replace contemporary market-based globalisation.|$|E
500|$|During the 20th century many politicians, such as Woodrow Wilson and Winston Churchill, {{used the}} term [...] "new world order" [...] {{to refer to a}} new period of history characterised by a {{dramatic}} change in world political thought and in the balance of power after World War I and World War II. They all saw the period as an opportunity to implement idealistic proposals for <b>global</b> <b>governance</b> in the sense of new collective efforts to address worldwide problems that go beyond the capacity of individual nation-states to solve, while always respecting the right of nations to self-determination. These proposals {{led to the formation of}} international organizations (such as the UN in 1945 and NATO in 1949), and international regimes (such as the Bretton Woods system (1944-1971) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT, 1947-1994)), which were calculated both to maintain a balance of power in favor of the United States and to regularize cooperation between nations, in order to achieve a peaceful phase of capitalism.

500|$|The global {{financial}} crisis and Great Recession prompted renewed {{discourse on the}} architecture of the {{global financial}} system. These events called to attention financial integration, inadequacies of <b>global</b> <b>governance,</b> and the emergent systemic risks of financial globalization. Since the establishment in 1945 of a formal international monetary system with the IMF empowered as its guardian, the world has undergone extensive changes politically and economically. This has fundamentally altered the paradigm in which international financial institutions operate, increasing the complexities of the IMF and World Bank's mandates. The lack of adherence to a formal monetary system has created a void of global constraints on national macroeconomic policies and a deficit of rule-based governance of financial activities. French economist and Executive Director of the World Economic Forum's Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee, Marc Uzan, has pointed out that some radical proposals such as a [...] "global central bank or a world financial authority" [...] have been deemed impractical, leading to further consideration of medium-term efforts to improve transparency and disclosure, strengthen emerging market financial climates, bolster prudential regulatory environments in advanced nations, and better moderate capital account liberalization and exchange rate regime selection in emerging markets. He has also drawn attention to calls for increased participation from the private sector in the management of financial crises and the augmenting of multilateral institutions' resources.|$|E
