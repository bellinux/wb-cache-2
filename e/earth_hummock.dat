This thesis is primary {{focused on the}} study of temperature regime particularly during freeze-thaw process and also on factors that affect its non-uniformity. Secondary, it refers to the relation between temperature and moisture regime, morphometric characteristics of earth hummocks and their geographical expansion in the world. The information from the literature search is applied to the results from temperature and moisture measurements of the earth hummocks in depths 5 - 40 cm in the Hrubý Jeseník Mountains - Keprník peak in 2005 - 2010. The results show that many factors affect the non-uniformity of temperature regime in different parts of earth hummocks. The most important of them are: the shape of the <b>earth</b> <b>hummock,</b> the aspect orientation, the distribution and the height of snow cover, the wind exposure and the presence of vegetation. There is an interaction between the soil moisture content and the temperature regime, and they are mutually affected.

The impact of <b>earth</b> <b>hummocks</b> on subsurface drainage was studied at three hillslope plots during the snow-free periods of 1993 and 1994 at a small hummock-covered Arctic tundra watershed (Siksik Creek) in north-western Canada. Subsurface drainage occurs preferentially through the unfrozen saturated layer of the inter-hummock area, owing to its relatively high permeability and connected nature. The inter-hummock area is composed of primary channels, oriented in the downslope direction, and secondary channels, obstructed from conducting water directly downslope. Because of their very low hydraulic conductivity, <b>earth</b> <b>hummocks</b> obstruct hillslope drainage.

40|$|Relationships of vegetation, earth hummocks, and {{topography}} {{were studied}} in the high arctic environment of Ellesmere Island, N. W. T., Canada. A belt-transect 2 m wide and 114 m long was established on a south-west facing slope of a small knoll, where well developed earth hummocks were recognized. The belt-transect was sectioned in 2 m × 2 m successive quadrats. For each quadrat, cover degree of individual species and total vegetation was assessed and recorded. After earth hummocks were categorized conveniently into three types according to a degree of being covered by vegetation, the number of earth hummocks in each quadrat was counted for each type. A topographical crosssection along the belt-transect was surveyed, and vegetation and <b>earth</b> <b>hummock</b> characteristics were correlated with topographical position. Well developed earth hummocks were recognized mainly {{at the base of}} a leeward slope of the knoll where snow possibly drifted and stayed long enough to protect vegetation and earth hummocks from strong wind, especially in winter. Vegetation, too, developed well in places where earth hummocks developed well; it consisted predominantly of Salix arctica, Saxifraga oppositifolia, Poa abbreviate, Dryas integrifolia, and Pedicularis arctica. Development of the earth hummocks was regarded as a synergistic product of such factors as fine soil material, topography, snow, permafrost, and vegetation. Snow was considered to play a decisive role in developing and maintaining well developed earth hummocks and vegetation by protecting them from adverse wind effects in winter.

The methodology involved detailed geomorphological mapping and precise measurement with a profileometer. The internal structure of the hummocks was investigated through excavations and sediment sample analyses. Fourteen sites with well-developed <b>earth</b> <b>hummocks</b> (accounting for over 650 individual hummock forms) were investigated.

40|$|The {{northern}} circumpolar permafrost region covers over 15 % of the earth’s land surface, {{and contains}} about 50 % of global belowground organic carbon (OC). There {{has been a}} great deal of recent interest in cataloguing the distribution of organic carbon in these soils, as the Arctic is expected to experience particularly large warming in the coming century, which has potential to cause a release of carbon to the atmosphere and lead to a substantial positive feedback to warming. Despite this concern, little work has been done to elucidate the depth distribution of organic carbon in mineral Cryosols (permafrost-affected soils). In this study, selected mineral Cryosols at Truelove Lowland, Devon Island, Nunavut and near Wright Pass, Yukon were examined. The depth distribution of OC in soils affected by cryoturbation (Turbic Cryosols) and soils not affected by cryoturbation (Static Cryosols) was compared using high depth-resolution GIS-based methods. Density of OC at Truelove Lowland ranged from 185 g OC m- 2 cm- 1 (1 g OC m- 2 cm- 1 = 0. 1 kg OC m- 3) near the surface to 28 g OC m- 2 cm- 1 at 90 cm depth in Turbic Cryosols and 178 g OC m- 2 cm- 1 near the surface to 11 g OC m- 2 cm- 1 at 25 cm depth in Static Cryosols. At Wright Pass, OC density ranged from 334 g OC m- 2 cm- 1 near the surface to 110 g OC m- 2 cm- 1 at 46 cm depth in Turbic Cryosols and 330 g OC m- 2 cm- 1 near the surface to 29 g OC m- 2 cm- 1 at 70 cm depth in Static Cryosols. When depth distribution was compared, it was found that Turbic Cryosols contain up to 125 g OC m- 2 cm- 1 more OC at depths of 20 to 45 cm at Truelove Lowland and up to 148 g OC m- 2 cm- 1 more OC at depths of 12 to 90 cm at Wright Pass. The high depth-resolution method employed in this study can determine OC content for any selected depth range, and could be employed with existing databases of OC to provide vertically-resolved measures of OC. Several existing models of cryoturbation processes were evaluated using data from this study. Soil movement by diapirism or cryohydrostatic movement is an unlikely explanation for the development of cryoturbation features in examined soil. Cryostatic movement and differential frost heave processes, however, are possible explanations for the development of some cryoturbation features. Some evidence suggests that transport of OC in a dissolved state may be important in the genesis of cryoturbation forms. Additionally, several Turbic Cryosol pedons were selected as representative with respect to soil morphology and presumed cryogenesis and were examined using carbon:nitrogen ratio and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to explore OC quality. In all near-surface samples from all pedons examined there was a high proportion of O-alkyl carbon (range from 58. 5 to 60. 2 %) and a high O-alkyl carbon to alkyl carbon ratio (range from 2. 3 to 2. 6). Near-surface OC in examined soils was labile compared to that of temperate ecosystems; however a high arctic nonsorted circle had similar OC lability and degree of humification at depth and near the soil surface (O-alkyl to alkyl carbon ratios of 3. 0 and 2. 6 and carbon to nitrogen ratios of 16. 5 and 16. 6, respectively), while a low arctic <b>earth</b> <b>hummock</b> had chemically transformed OC at depth (O-alkyl carbon contents of 39. 0 and 60. 2 % and O-alkyl to alkyl carbon ratios of 0. 8 and 2. 4, respectively).

The first axis of the ordination corresponds to a complex soil moisture gradient and the second axis corresponds to a complex geology/elevation/climate gradient.

40|$|Abstract: Detailed {{investigations}} of peaty <b>earth</b> <b>hummocks</b> called pounus {{were carried out}} in northemmost Finnish Lapland {{in the vicinity of}} the Kevo Subarctic Research Station. Pounus are complex, often vegetated, cryogenic mounds formed partly of peat. Some have a core of mineral soil or several large stones, or just one frost-heaved boulder covered by peat. They belong to the same group of <b>earth</b> <b>hummocks</b> as thufur and non-sorted circles. The typology of pounus is described and compared with other types of cryogenic earth hum-mocks. Stratigraphical study of pounus shows how cryoturbation has deformed the previous soil horizons of typical Arctic podzols and has been followed by intense peat growth and later frost reactivation. Microstructures in pounus confirm the frost activity and several phases of peat growth during their formation. Alternating warmer and dryer conditions with water-table rise and renewed peat formation could be inferred. The present stage of development is frost reactivation and peat growth. Pounus are relatively young features. The maximum age for pounu development corresponds with the age of peat formation. Peat of a boulder pounu yielded a data of 330 + 70 BP and a minerogenic pounu gave an age of 710 + 50 BP. The Sphagnum peat formation on peat pounus started intensively about 1000 BP. They are random surficial forms with variable control by frost heave and vegetation growth, independent of the presence or absence of permafrost.

40|$|Runoff {{processes}} {{at three}} hummock-covered hillslopes within a 95 ha catchment (Siksik Creek) in the tundra {{region of the}} Canadian western Arctic were studied for three years (1992 - 1994). Measurements over the study included all hydrological inputs, monitoring of active layer and water table depths, chemical tracer-based measurements of subsurface flow velocities, continuous and spot measurements of surface and subsurface discharges, detailed mapping of the hummock distribution and soil types, and continuous gauging of the main stream channel. Tundra is a heterogeneous medium in both horizontal (due {{to the presence of}} periglacial features such as mineral <b>earth</b> <b>hummocks)</b> and vertical (due to abrupt changes in hydraulic conductivity with depth) directions. Hillslope runoff occurs through the unfrozen saturated layer of the interhummock zone (IHZ), owing to its relatively high permeability and connected nature. The subsurface runoff rate is controlled by the saturated layer position and flowpath type. Subsurface flow follows downslope oriented flowpaths (primary and macrochannnel flowpaths), and flowpaths obstructed from conducting directly downslope (secondary flowpaths). The water velocity, discharge and residence time of the subsurface flowpaths are highly variable spatially and temporally as a result of variations in the thickness and elevation of the unfrozen saturated layer; and the composition and arrangement of flowpaths on hillslopes. Rapid subsurface flow (i. e. subsurface flow occurring at surface runoff-like velocities) occurs through the highly conductive near-surface peat as well as through macrochannels. Although surface runoff is rare, the task of transmitting runoff rapidly to the stream is accomplished by rapid subsurface flow. All flowpath types conduct runoff at similarly high rates when the saturated layer is within the highly conductive near surface peats. When the saturated layer is below this near-surface zone, but still within the depth range where macrochannels occur, the macrochannel flowpaths (i. e. flowpaths containing active macrochannels) continue discharging at a relatively high rate, while primary and secondary flowpaths conduct flow at a lower level. Aside from their impact on the composition and arrangement of flowpaths in the IHZ, the presence of mineral <b>earth</b> <b>hummocks</b> on hillslopes increases the tortuosity of flowpaths in the IHZ, and as a result the residence time of runoff on hillslope is increased. Mineral <b>earth</b> <b>hummocks</b> also reduce the volume of runoff reaching the streambank during a runoff event, as a small amount of runoff in the IBZ flows into the hummocks. The presence of hummocks also enhances runoff from hillslopes by displacing the saturated layer of the interhummock zone upward where the hydraulic conductivity can be orders of magnitude higher. The near-stream area has a large impact on hillslope runoff and streamflow because of its location in the basin (surrounding the stream channel), and its deeper peat accumulation (and therefore greater water storage capacity). The rate at which the saturated layer falls away from the surface in the near-stream area varies among plots, and as a result the duration of the spring runoff period (high flow rates), and the nature of its adjustment to the summer regime (low flow rates) varies among the hillslopes. The major hillslope water fluxes and related processes are presented in a conceptual model, which is used as an explanatory framework for the level of flow in the stream channel...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The O’Neill-Miller {{model of}} frost heave, which takes {{account of a}} {{partially}} frozen fringe between the frozen and unfrozen soil, is used to study the mechanism of differential frost heave, which is a possible cause of <b>earth</b> <b>hummocks</b> and stone circles. In order to facilitate this study, the model must firstly be generalised to three dimensions, which requires a modification, due to Gilpin, of Miller’s concept of regelation; secondly, four key simplifications, variously introduced in previous work by Holden, Fowler and Krantz, {{must be made to}} render the computation of the model tractable. With these simplifications, and with the assumption that frozen soil deforms viscously, the model can be reduced to a coupled set of partial differential equations for the frozen soil temperature and velocity. A quasi-stationary stability analysis of the uniform heaving state is conducted on a simplified version of this reduced model to examine whether spatial instabilities can occur in physically realistic conditions.

40|$|The {{formation}} of {{some forms of}} patterned ground, notably <b>earth</b> <b>hummocks</b> and stone circles, is associated with seasonal freezing and a spatial instability in the resulting frost heave. We analyse the Miller model of frost heave for such spatial instability, by incorporating three-dimensionsal heat and mass transfer, and allowing the frozen soil to deform as a viscous medium. We find that the heaving process is generally (but not always) stable, but that if account is taken of a surface snow cover, then the insulating thermal properties of the snow predict that instability will occur if a dimensionless parameter N ? 0 : 02. The parameter N is given by N = j f v s =(ae f gd 2), where j f is the frozen soil viscosity, v s is the surface heave rate, ae f is the frozen soil density, g is gravity, and d is {{the depth of the}} freezing front.

40|$|Frost heave {{describes}} the phenomenon whereby soil freezing causes upwards surface motion {{due to the}} action of capillary suction imbibing water from the unfrozen region below. The expansion of water on freezing is {{a small part of}} the overall surface heave and it is the flow of water towards the freezing front which is largely responsible for the uplift. In this thesis, we analyse a model of frost heave due to Miller (1972, 1978) which is referred to as `secondary frost heave'. Secondary frost heave is characterised by the existence of a `partially frozen zone', underlying the frozen soil, in which ice and water coexist in the pore space. In the first part of the thesis we follow earlier work of Fowler, Krantz and Noon where we show that the Miller model for incompressible soils can be dramatically simplified. The second part of the thesis then uses this simplification procedure to develop simplified models for saline and compressible soils. In the latter case, the development of the theory leads to the consideration of non-equilibrium soil consolidation theory and the formation of segregated massive ice within permafrost. The final part of the thesis extends the simplified Miller model to the analysis of differential frost heave and the formation of patterned ground (e. g. <b>earth</b> <b>hummocks</b> and stone circles).

CLASS simulations with and without the new organic soil parameterisation developed for peatland conditions were compared with three summer months of measurements at each site. The sites are located in a cryoturbated region and are underlain by continuous permafrost and feature mineral soil hummocks and organic soil inter-hummock zones. Results from the peatland version of CLASS showed significant improvement over the standard version although in both cases, there was an underestimation of latent heat fluxes and overestimation of sensible heat fluxes. The observed soil moisture contents are almost constant at both sites. Field photographs show the sites are located in low-lying areas, one in a local depression and the other {{at the bottom of a}} valley. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the constant soil moisture content is maintained by lateral flow from adjacent hillslopes. This assumption could be further supported by the influence of mineral <b>earth</b> <b>hummocks</b> in TVC drainage basin. CLASS is a one-dimensional column model and it is not possible to explicitly represent lateral flow.
