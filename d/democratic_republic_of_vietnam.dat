50|$|One of {{the central}} frustrations of the U.S. {{military}} during the conflict was the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam's</b> (North <b>Vietnam)</b> use <b>of</b> Laos and Cambodia as logistical conduits and base areas. During the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson, the U.S. military was generally not allowed by its civilian commanders to widen the war by attacking the supply routes and sanctuaries in both countries due to their ostensible neutrality. An {{attempt was made to}} capture or destroy the headquarters during Operation Junction City, a massive search and destroy operation launched in the border region in February and March 1967.|$|R

At the time, there was a power vacuum, as both Japan and France had been decimated by the war. There was an outbreak of nationalist fervour in Vietnam; Tảng and Thảo joined the Vanguard Youth, an impromptu independence militia. Tảng was assigned to be the leader of the local unit, but he left the movement soon after, leaving Thảo in command. During this period, Saigon was regularly engulfed in riots.|$|E
5|$|Operation Commando Hunt was {{a covert}} U.S. Seventh Air Force and U.S. Navy Task Force 77 aerial interdiction {{campaign}} {{that took place}} during the Vietnam War.

50|$|In 1946, when Ho {{traveled}} {{outside of}} the country, his subordinates imprisoned 2,500 non-communist nationalists and forced 6,000 others to flee. Hundreds of political opponents were jailed or exiled in July 1946, notably members of the National Party <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> and the Dai Viet National Party, after a failed attempt to raise a coup against the Vietminh government. All rival political parties were hereafter banned and local governments were purged to minimize opposition later on. However, {{it was noted that}} the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam's</b> first Congress had over two-third of its members come from non-Viet Minh political factions, some without election.

5|$|The Vietnam War, (also {{known as}} the Second Indochina War, Vietnam Conflict, and in Vietnam as the American War), took place from 1955 to 1975. The war was fought between the Communist-supported <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> and the United States-supported Republic of Vietnam, {{beginning}} {{with the presence of}} a small number of US military advisors in 1955 and escalating into direct US involvement in a ground war in 1965. US combat forces were withdrawn in early 1973 pursuant to the Paris Peace Accords, but the war continued concluding with the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the French Army at Điện Biên Phủ in 1954, {{followed}} by the Geneva Accords, led to a divided Vietnam. The French-backed State of Vietnam, led by former Emperor Bảo Đại, provisionally held control south of the 17th parallel. Hồ Chí Minh's Viet Minh held the north under the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> which Hồ Chí Minh had proclaimed in 1945. The agreements stated that nationwide elections were {{to be held in}} 1956 to unify the country under a common government. In July 1954, during the transition period, Bảo Đại appointed Diệm as Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|At 18:00 on 29 January 1968, South Vietnamese forces began a 36-hour ceasefire {{in celebration}} of {{the arrival of the}} Year of the Monkey. Earlier, the communists had {{declared}} a seven-day ceasefire as part of the Tet festival, that was normally a period of truce and for community gatherings and family reunions in Vietnamese society. However, unbeknown to the South Vietnamese and their allies, the North Vietnamese leadership had decided to use the cease-fire to launch a large offensive in the south in order to break the deadlock that had developed in the conflict—despite the reluctance of <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> President Ho Chi Minh and Defence Minister General Vo Nguyen Giap.|$|E
25|$|Campaign 139 {{was named}} by the Vietnamese {{communist}} military convention of encoding the founding date in an operational code name; in its case, the 13th day of the 9th month. On 13 September 1969, the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam's</b> General Võ Nguyên Giáp tasked General Vũ Lập with command of Campaign 139, to be waged in Military Region 2 of Laos. Included in the orders were ten Pathet Lao battalions for service; however, those battalions mustered only about 150 men each. Given their propensity for flight rather than fight, they were of dubious military value to Vũ Lập. The major forces in Campaign 139 {{would be the first}} PAVN combined arms team to invade northern Laos. Already in place in MR 2 awaiting Vũ Lập's leadership were 26 People's Army <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> (PAVN) battalions and 60 tanks.|$|R

5|$|Sihanouk came {{to believe}} that {{communist}} triumph in Southeast Asia was inevitable and that Cambodia's military was incapable of defeating the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> (North Vietnam), even with U.S. support. If Cambodia (and his rule) was to survive, he would have to make a bargain with the devil. On 10 April 1965 he broke off diplomatic relations with the U.S. and swung politically to the left. To gain foreign support, both economic and political, Sihanouk turned to the People's Republic of China. One of the terms of the agreement between Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai was that Cambodia would allow the use of its eastern border by the North Vietnamese in their effort to reunify the two Vietnams.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnam War, {{also known}} as the Second Indochina War, and in Vietnam as the American War, {{occurred}} from 1959 to April 30, 1975.

The war was fought between the Communist-supported <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> and the United States supported Republic of Vietnam. It concluded with the defeat and failure of the United States foreign policy in Vietnam. On April 30, 1975, the capital of South Vietnam, Saigon fell to the communist forces of North Vietnam, effectively ending the Vietnam War. Over 8.7 million U.S. forces participated in the Vietnam War; of whom slightly over 47,000 were killed in battle and almost 11,000 more died of non-battle causes.|$|E
5|$|Vietnam is a one-party socialist republic.

In the meantime, the French had started the State <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> and Diệm refused Bảo Đại's offer to become the Prime Minister. On 16 June 1949, he then published a new manifesto in newspapers proclaiming a third force different from Vietminh and Bảo Đại, but raised little interest and otherwise, his statement was evident to both the French and Việt Minh that Diệm was a dangerous rival. In 1950, the Việt Minh lost patience and sentenced him to death in absentia, and the French refused to protect him. Hồ Chí Minh's cadres tried to assassinate {{him while he was}} traveling to visit his elder brother Thục, bishop of the Vĩnh Long diocese in the Mekong Delta. Recognizing of his political status, Diệm decided to leave Vietnam in 1950.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{offers a}} historical sociology of {{the making and}} unmaking of rule in a frontier borderland in Vietnam. By thinking through the social processes accompanying the spatial expansion and configuration of state power, I argue that military conquest was a necessary but insufficient step towards an emergent nationstate's lasting consolidation of territorial claims. Legitimating state claims to territory rested on mutually constitutive and spatialized processes of institutionalizing relations of rule; agrarian development and reciprocal exchange; constructing communities of nation and ethnicity; and social mobilization during, and for purposes of, warfare. Because the first Indochina war ended dramatically in Dien Bien Phu, the past {{of what is now}} a national frontier is remembered and forgotten in particular ways. In Vietnam, the site is celebrated as battle and setting for victory in 1954 of revolutionary ideals over foreign oppression. What is not remembered in such nationalist histories has equal significance for understanding the sometimes contradictory outcomes of state making. This dissertation analyzes human beings as complex, thinking persons with wayward agendas who did not always respond as intended. Grounded in archival research, the dissertation attends {{to the ways in which}} state claims to territory and legitimate rule are contested and how outcomes are contingent and non-linear. The narrative begins when colonial officers and mapmakers encountered the Sipsongchauthai confederation in the late 19 th century, recognized a ruling Thai elite, incorporated them into French Tonkin, and, in so doing, remade the Black River borderlands into an imperial frontier. After World War II, France organized the Thai Federation, created splits among local elites, and unintentionally generated support for the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam's</b> nationalist alternative. Although cadres legitimized national rule by delegitimizing a neocolonial rival, Vietnam's emergent -Northwest[DOUBLE VERTICAL LINE] region reproduced Tonkin's borders and underlying political configuration while political elites reproduced the colonial category of -ethnicity[DOUBLE VERTICAL LINE] to regulate uncertain boundaries between community and territory, land and class. The unsteady incorporation of Black River peoples into Vietnam illustrates an evolving-and ongoing-negotiation between highlands and lowlands, center and frontier, state and society, nation and ethnicity...|$|R
5|$|The Geneva Conference {{opened on}} 8 May 1954, {{the day after}} the {{surrender}} of the garrison. Ho Chi Minh entered the conference on the opening day with the news of his troops' victory in the headlines. The resulting agreement temporarily partitioned Vietnam into two zones: the North was administered by the communist <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> while the South was administered by the French-supported State of Vietnam. The last units of the French Union forces withdrew from Indochina in 1956. This partition was supposed to be temporary, and the two zones were meant to be reunited through national elections in 1956. After the French withdrawal, the United States supported the southern government, under Emperor Bao Dai and Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem, which opposed the Geneva agreement, and which claimed that Ho Chi Minh's forces from the North had been killing Northern loyalists and terrorizing people both north and south. The North was supported by both the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Soviet Union (USSR). This arrangement proved tenuous and escalated into the Vietnam War (Second Indochina War), eventually bringing 500,000 American troops into South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Vietnam was {{in chaos}} after the Japanese invaded {{the country during}} World War II and {{displaced}} the French colonial administration. At {{the end of the}} war, the Japanese left the country and France, severely weakened by political turmoil within the Vichy regime, was unable to exert control. Hồ Chí Minh's Viet Minh declared independence as the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> and battled other Vietnamese nationalist groups as well as French forces for control of the nation. During this time, Cẩn organised a clandestine support base for Diệm in central Vietnam. At the time, Diệm was one of many nationalists who were attempting to stake a claim to national leadership, having spent a decade in self-imposed exile from public affairs. Cẩn helped weaken other anti-communist nationalist groups, such as the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng (Vietnamese Nationalist Party) and the Đại Việt Quốc Dân Đảng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam), which competed with Diệm for support. On 23 October 1955, Diệm toppled Bảo Đại in a fraud-ridden referendum orchestrated by Nhu. Diệm declared himself President of the newly proclaimed Republic of Vietnam three days later.|$|E
5|$|Thi {{was born}} on 23 February 1923 in Huế, then the capital of Vietnam and {{the seat of the}} Nguyễn dynasty. At the time, Vietnam was part of the colony of French Indochina and his father was a {{low-level}} mandarin in the French-controlled monarchy and had served in the French Army during World War I. Thi joined the French Army at 17; a few months later, Imperial Japan invaded Indochina during World War II, wresting control from France. Thi was a Japanese prisoner of war for several months until he escaped amidst the confusion of an Allied bombing raid on the Japanese military jail. According to family documents, Thi was captured and imprisoned by the communist Viet Minh of Ho Chi Minh for three months {{at the end of the}} war in 1945 as they declared independence during the August Revolution. At the time, a power vacuum emerged as the defeated Japanese withdrew from Vietnam. France attempted to reassert its colonial grip over Indochina, while various Vietnamese groups jockeyed for power at the head of an independent country. In 1946, full-scale conflict erupted between the Vietminh, who had declared the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> (DRV) independent, and France. As part of their political effort, the French created the State of Vietnam (SoV), an associated state in the French Union, and installed former Emperor Bảo Đại as the head of state. Thi served in the SoV's Vietnamese National Army (VNA), and rose steadily up the ranks.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, Diệm {{had been}} the Interior Minister of Vietnam, serving under Emperor Bảo Đại. However, he {{resigned}} {{after a few months}} because the French colonial authorities would not give Vietnam any meaningful autonomy, and became a private citizen for the next decade. During World War II, Imperial Japan attacked Indochina and wrested control from France, but when they were defeated by the Allies in 1945, a power vacuum emerged. The communist-dominated Viet Minh of Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> and fought for independence, while the French attempted to regain control of their colony, and created the State of Vietnam under Bảo Đại, which was an associated free state within the French Union. A staunch anti-communist nationalist, Diệm opposed both and attempted to create his own movement, with little success. With both the French and the communists hostile to him, Diệm felt unsafe and went into self-imposed exile in 1950, leaving Vietnam {{for the first time in}} his life. He did so as the communists had sentenced him to death in absentia, while the French refused to give him protection, claiming that they had no resources. Diệm spent most of the next four years in the United States and Europe enlisting support, particularly among fellow Catholic politicians in America and Vatican officials. Diệm's success with the latter group was helped by the fact that his elder brother Ngô Đình Thục was the leading Catholic cleric in Vietnam and had studied with high-ranking priests in Rome.|$|E
5|$|The first {{chairman}} of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly was the scholar Nguyễn Văn Tố; {{he was not a}} member of the Communist Party. On 3March 1946, under the chairmanship of Nguyễn Văn Tố, the National Assembly formed the first government of the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam.</b> Nguyễn Văn Tố was succeeded in office on 9November 1946 by Bùi Bằng Đoàn, a poet and another non-Communist Party member. While he was never a member of the Communist Party, he was a committed revolutionary. Tôn Đức Thắng succeeded Bùi Bằng Đoàn as chairman in 1955, and was the first chairman to be a member of the Communist Party. Trường Chinh became the fourth and longest-serving {{chairman of}} the National Assembly in Vietnamese history, holding the post from 1960 to 1981, when he became {{chairman of the}} State Council, a newly established post. Nguyễn Hữu Thọ, a Southerner, succeeded Trường in 1981, as chairman, but he was {{not a member of the}} Politburo. Nguyễn Hữu Thọ stepped down as chairman in 1987, and was succeeded by Lê Quang Đạo, another non-Politburo member. As with Nguyễn Hữu Thọ, Lê Quang Đạo's tenure lasted one term. Nông Đức Mạnh was elected chairman in 1992, and held office until 2001 Nông was the first chairman who came from a minority background, the Tày, and was the first chairman since Trường who was a Politburo member. Nông stepped down in 2001, and was succeeded by Nguyễn Văn An, who served as chairman from 2001 until 2006. On 26June 2006 Nguyễn Phú Trọng was elected chairman with a majority of 84.58% of the National Assembly deputies in favour. Nguyễn Phú Trọng stepped down in 2011 because of his election to the post of General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, and was succeeded by Nguyễn Sinh Hùng.
