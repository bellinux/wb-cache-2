5|$|Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 (formally {{designated}} D/1993F2) was a comet {{that broke}} apart in July 1992 and collided with Jupiter in July 1994, providing the first <b>direct</b> <b>observation</b> of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects.

5|$|In {{fields such}} as {{astrophysics}} or meteorology, where <b>direct</b> <b>observation</b> or laboratory experiments are difficult or impossible, the scientific method instead relies on observation and logical inference. In such fields, the test of falsifiability is satisfied when a theory is used to predict the results of new observations. When such observations contradict a theory's predictions, it may be revised or discarded if an alternative better explains the observed facts. For example, Newton's theory of gravitation was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity when the latter was observed to more precisely predict the orbit of Mercury.|$|E
5|$|Long-range atomic {{exchange}} {{is a process}} involving an adatom inserting into the surface as in the normal atomic exchange mechanism, but instead of a nearest-neighbor atom it is an atom some distance further from the initial adatom that emerges. Shown in figure 9, this process has only been observed in molecular dynamics simulations {{and has yet to}} be confirmed experimentally. In spite of this long range atomic exchange, as well as a variety of other exotic diffusion mechanisms, are anticipated to contribute substantially at temperatures currently too high for <b>direct</b> <b>observation.</b>|$|E

5|$|Dislocations are {{the most}} common {{structural}} defect in natural diamond. The two major types of dislocations are the glide set, in which bonds break between layers of atoms with different indices (those not lying directly above each other) and the shuffle set, in which the breaks occur between atoms of the same index. The dislocations produce dangling bonds which introduce energy levels into the band gap, enabling the absorption of light. Broadband blue photoluminescence has been reliably identified with dislocations by <b>direct</b> <b>observation</b> in an electron microscope, however, it was noted that not all dislocations are luminescent, and there is no correlation between the dislocation type and the parameters of the emission.|$|E
40|$|Stream-tracer {{injections}} {{were used}} to examine the effect of channel morphology and changing stream discharge on hyporheic exchange flows. <b>Direct</b> <b>observations</b> were made from well networks to follow tracer movement through the hyporheic zone. The reach-integrated influence of hyporheic exchange was evaluated using the transient storage model (TSM) OTIS-P. Transient storage modelling results were compared with <b>direct</b> <b>observations</b> to evaluate the reliability of the TSM. Results from the tracer injection in the bedrock reach supported the assumption that most transient storage in headwater mountain streams results from hyporheic exchange. <b>Direct</b> <b>observations</b> from the well networks hi colluvial reaches showed that subsurface flow paths tended to parallel the valley axis. Cross-valley gradients were weak except near steps, where vertical and cross-valley hydraulic gradients indicated a strong potential for stream water to downwell into the hyporheic zone. The TSM parameters showed that both size and residence time of transient storage were greater in reaches with a few large log-jam-formed steps than in reaches with more frequent, but smaller steps. <b>Direct</b> <b>observations</b> showed that residence times in the unconstrained stream were longer than in the constrained stream and that little change occurred in the location and extent of the hyporheic zone between low- and high-baseflow discharges in any of the colluvial reaches. The transient storage modelling results did not agree with these observations, suggesting that the TSM was insensitive to long residence-time exchange flows and was very sensitive to changes in discharge.

5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the purpose of fungal bioluminescence is to attract arthropods to the fruit body to help disseminate spores. However, there has been no <b>direct</b> <b>observation</b> of this phenomenon. In many species, the mycelium is luminescent, but the fruit body is not, which argues against this hypothesis. Mycelial bioluminence may also function to attract animals that can potentially carry fungal spores in well-hydrated areas, as light emission from the mycelium is higher when it is hydrated. This would presumably increase the chance that spores would be deposited in an environment that is already optimal for growth. Basidiomycete mushrooms are known to be dependent on an adequate moisture supply for proper development. In species with a luminous mycelium, the mycelium would therefore have a dual function in performing the fungal translocation that permits transport of substances from the further environment back to the fruiting body, and in attracting disseminating vectors towards environments favorable for development of the species.|$|E
5|$|The {{parents of}} the {{affected}} individual are typically genetically normal. The extra chromosome occurs by chance. The possibility increases from less than 0.1% in 20-year-old mothers to 3% in those age 45. There is no known behavioral activity or environmental factor that changes the possibility. Down syndrome can be identified during pregnancy by prenatal screening followed by diagnostic testing or after birth by <b>direct</b> <b>observation</b> and genetic testing. More children are born with Down syndrome in countries where abortion is not allowed and in countries where pregnancy more commonly occurs at a later age. About 1.4 per 1000 live births in the United States and 1.1 per 1000 live births in Norway are affected. In the 1950s, in the United States, it occurred in 2 per 1000 live births with the decrease since then due to prenatal screening and abortions. The number of pregnancies with Down syndrome is more than two times greater with many spontaneously aborting. It {{is the cause of}} 8% of all congenital disorders.|$|E

40|$|Measuring behaviour, {{especially}} oral behaviour, {{has always}} been a debated issue: therefore the aim {{of this paper is to}} closely examine the study of oral behaviour in calves and the approaching methodology. Behavioural observations were conducted by two media (<b>direct</b> <b>observations</b> by check sheets and indirect observations by videotapes recorded by cam- eras connected to a digital field switcher and a time-lapse video recorder) in order to compare data and assess the reli- ability and validity of the two methods in identifying some oral behavioural patterns in calves. The study was carried out on 54 Polish Friesian calves housed in group pens and in individual crates. The behaviour of the calves was investigated during the fattening period on the 2 nd, 7 th, 13 th, 18 th and 23 rd week, one hour before and one hour after each of the two meals. Two experienced observers checked the behaviour of the calves, including oral behaviours on structures and buckets and oral stereotypies, by <b>direct</b> <b>observations</b> using a scan sampling every 2 min- utes. The calves' behaviour was also video recorded on the same days in which the <b>direct</b> <b>observations</b> were carried out and analysed by the same two observers. Percentages of time spent on each type of behaviour were calculated and anal- ysed by Chi-square test. Regardless of the housing system, the comparison between <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>observations</b> revealed significant differences in almost every behavioural category. Licking, biting and nibbling structures, nibbling and sucking the bucket, playing with the bucket and the teat, chewing and oral stereotypies were significantly higher in <b>direct</b> <b>observations</b> compared to indirect (P < 0. 001), while inactivity was higher in video recorded observations (P < 0. 001). In conclusion, regardless of the type of housing, our results revealed an objective difficulty in analysing videotapes with very detailed behavioural categories, like oral behaviours. Although video recording can certainly represent a useful and practical alternative to <b>direct</b> <b>observations</b> in many situations, the video recording system used in this study for investi- gating calves' oral behaviour, in spite of the use of multiple cameras, could not replace <b>direct</b> <b>observations,</b> probably due to the restricted field of view, the low depth of focus, the black and white vision, the lack of audio and the time-lapse feature...|$|R

40|$|Intercepted {{rainfall}} may be evaporated {{during or}} after the rain event. Intercepted rain is generally determined as the difference between rainfall measurements outside and inside the forest. Such measurements are often used to discriminate between water storage and evaporation during rain as well. Two well-accepted methods underestimate water storage by a factor two as compared to <b>direct</b> <b>observations.</b> The underestimation of storage is compensated by an overestimation of evaporation during rain {{by a factor of}} three. The <b>direct</b> <b>observations</b> of water storage and evaporation appear to agree with previous <b>direct</b> <b>observations.</b> Thus, it is concluded that these observations are representative Also, our results based on methods using only rainfall measurements inside and outside the forest appear to agree with previous results, This would result in the conclusion that the common methods systematically underestimate water storage and overestimate evaporation during rain. Indeed, the systematic errors {{can be explained by the}} neglect of drainage before saturation. Water storage is better simulated assuming an exponential saturation of a larger storage capacity. A smaller evaporation can be simulated using an appropriate resistance to vapour transport. The observations in dense coniferous forest showed water storage to be the dominant process in rainfall interception, but this conclusion should not be generalized to other forests and climates. <b>Direct</b> <b>observations</b> of water storage and evaporation are recommended to build a realistic set of parameters for rainfall interception studies of the main vegetation types.
