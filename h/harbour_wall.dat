5|$|Cyclone Rewa {{started to}} affect New Caledonia on 5January, before it passed over Grand Terre Island later that day. Rewa dumped over 300mm (12in) of rain on {{parts of the}} archipelago, which made {{all of the major}} rivers {{overflow}} and burst their banks. Several landslides and a death were recorded within New Caledonia, while on the Loyalty Island of Mare, waves from Rewa partially destroyed the <b>harbour</b> <b>wall</b> at Tadine's port.|$|E
5|$|The small burns {{that are}} tributaries to the East Burn {{contributed to the}} {{draining}} of the lands of Dunnikier Estate. The burn emerges from a deep-set culvert to flow under the Victoria Viaduct, down a deep gorge, through the site of Hutchison's Flour Mills before running parallel to the <b>harbour</b> <b>wall</b> and into the sea. From the mid-19th century, the Hutchison's buildings became a significant landmark adjacent to the burn. The flour millers chose this area for its railway connection which linked the main station to the harbour, rather than for the {{need to use the}} burn to power the mills. The West (or Tiel) Burn, was also important, providing power for textile mills. This burn flowed out of the Raith Estate lands where scenically and recreationally it was used to create Raith Lake (with its tributary, the Dronachy Burn). The mill owners in Linktown also made use of the burn.|$|E
25|$|On 14 November 1932, a fire {{broke out}} while Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft was moored at Sumatra Kade, Amsterdam. Tugs towed the burning ship out into the IJ, where she burned for nine days. The ship was too badly damaged to repair, and on 6 December 1932 she was sold for scrap. While she was being towed to the scrapyard, she almost capsized. After this she ran aground and broke free from her tow, hitting the <b>harbour</b> <b>wall</b> at Pernis. Another {{fire broke out}} and she then sank. The ship was raised, and arrived at Hendrik Ido Ambacht for {{scrapping}} on 15 December 1932.|$|E

25|$|From 1 March 1864 until 31 August 1865, Captain Thomas {{measured}} sea temperatures {{from the}} Chain Pier. The data supported {{the acceptance of}} the Gulf Stream as a mechanism to explain the warmer seas around Scotland, especially in the west. In 1869, as an experiment into using electric light for lighthouses, Thomas Stevenson had an underwater cable installed from the eastern breakwater of Granton harbour. An operator on the <b>harbour</b> <b>wall,</b> with a switch and a Bunsen cell (an early form of battery), controlled a light {{on the end of the}} Chain Pier from half a mile (800 m) away.|$|E

On 27 November 1924 Dieppe had a mishap in which she ended up hitting the breakwater at Newhaven Harbour stern first. The tugs Alert and Richmere were sent to her aid. Richmere became disabled when a cable became entangled around her propellor. The Newhaven Lifeboat Sir Fitzroy Clayton was sent to her aid. Richmere ended up being dashed against the <b>harbour</b> <b>wall</b> and sank. Her crew were rescued by the lifeboat and the tug was later raised and repaired. Dieppe managed to dock some five hours after the drama began.|$|E
25|$|Early December {{brought a}} period of cold settled weather to the UK, which offered some respite from the flooding. On 14 December, low {{pressure}} area Nicki brought coastal flooding along the south coast of England and eastern Scotland. Weymouth harbourside was flooded, and 30 homes in Looe were also flooded. Some residents in the Scottish towns of Stonehaven and Peterhead were evacuated. In Kingsbridge, Devon the town centre was flooded after the quay was overtopped and the railway line to Dawlish was disrupted after flooding. £500,000 of damage was caused at North Berwick, Lothian by the waves, with a 15m section of <b>harbour</b> <b>wall</b> brought down in Lossiemouth.|$|E

50|$|In British English, a dock is an {{enclosed}} area of water used for loading, unloading, building or repairing ships. Such a dock may {{be created by}} building enclosing <b>harbour</b> <b>walls</b> into an existing natural water space, or by excavation within what would otherwise be dry land.|$|R

25|$|Since the 17th century {{there have}} been many {{attempts}} to create a harbour for St Agnes. Between 1632 and 1709 the Tonkins, lords of the manor of Trevaunance, expended the family legacy as they tried to build a harbour. Three attempts were made, the last of which was assisted by Henry Winstanley, but that harbour was washed away in 1705. The harbour built in 1710 by an unrelated party was levelled in 1730 by the crashing Atlantic Ocean waves. A new harbour constructed in 1798 supported a fishing industry and allowed for the export of copper ore and the import of coal from South Wales for the smelters at the mines. St Agnes remained a busy port until the collapse of the <b>harbour</b> <b>wall</b> in a storm in 1915/16. There are only remains of the old harbour in existence.|$|E
500|$|The church's {{twin towers}} were {{preserved}} by {{the intervention of}} Trinity House, since they had long been important as a landmark for shipping. Some materials from the structure were incorporated into a replacement church, also dedicated to St Mary, built at Hillborough in the same parish. Much of the rest {{was used for the}} building of a new <b>harbour</b> <b>wall</b> at Margate, known as Margate Pier. Other remnants of the original 7th-century church apart from those on the site include fragments of a high cross of stone that stood inside the church, and two stone columns that formed part of an arch between the nave and chancel, which were still in place when the church was demolished. These are now kept in Canterbury Cathedral, and are among the features that have led to the church being described as an [...] of Anglo-Saxon church architecture and sculpture.|$|E
500|$|The {{demolition}} of this [...] "shrine of early Christendom", and [...] of Anglo-Saxon church architecture and sculpture, was otherwise thorough, {{and it is}} now represented only by the ruins on the site, material incorporated into a replacement parish church at Hillborough, fragments of the cross, and the two stone columns which {{had been part of the}} church's triple arch. The columns and fragments of the cross are on display in Canterbury Cathedral. Two thousand tons of stone from the demolished church were sold and incorporated into the <b>harbour</b> <b>wall</b> at Margate, known as Margate Pier, which was completed in 1815, and more than 40tons of lead was stripped from the church and sold for £900. Trinity House bought what was left of the structure from the parish for £100, to ensure that the towers were preserved as a navigational aid, and built the first groynes, designed to protect the cliff on which the ruins stand. The spires had both been destroyed by storms by 1819, when Trinity House replaced them with similarly shaped, open structures, topped by wind vanes. These structures remained until they were removed some time after 1928. The ruins of the church, and the site of the Roman fort within which it was built, are now in the care of English Heritage, and the sea defences around Reculver are maintained by the Environment Agency.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first record}} of the Cobb, the town's <b>harbour</b> <b>wall,</b> is in a 1328 {{document}} describing it as having been damaged by storms. It was made of oak piles driven into the seabed with boulders stacked between. The boulders had been floated into place, tied between empty barrels. A 1685 account describes it as, [...] "an immense mass of stone, of a shape of a demi-lune, with a bar {{in the middle of}} the concave: no one stone that lies there was ever touched with a tool or bedded in any sort of cement, but all the pebbles of the see are piled up, and held by their bearings only, and the surge plays in and out through the interstices of the stone in a wonderful manner." [...] The Cobb wall provides a breakwater to protect the town from storms and separates Monmouth and Cobb Gate beaches.|$|E

Originally called the [...] "Bath Saloons complex", it had an open air tide-filled swimming bath. The complex was opened in 1853 after Beacon Hill headland was dynamited to make space for it. Charles Dickens was said to have made readings there. In the 1900s a ballroom and a new sea water-filled swimming pool were built. The Marine Spa provided various therapies such as seaweed baths, needle, douche showers, hot and cold water baths and electric shock treatment. Bands such as Ivy Benson and Ted Heath played at Marine Spa ballroom. Four stone arches that were part of the Marine Spa are still visible {{on the outside of the}} <b>harbour</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} 5th Marquess {{inherited}} the family seat, which he renamed Anglesey Castle. Renowned for his lavish spending and flamboyant lifestyle, he converted the family chapel inside the house into a performance space called the Gaiety Theatre. Plays were put on regularly, with [...] "the Dancing Marquess" [...] often taking the lead role himself. The 5th Marquess's extravagant spending drained the family fortune, and after his death in 1905, 6th Marquess began to sell off assets to help restore the solvency of the family. The family also sold off their main home at Beaudesert and their London house, and moved into Plas Newydd permanently. The 6th Marquess made the final big changes to the house by removing the crenellations from the roof, disposing of the theatre, knocking three servants' rooms together to make the dining room and covering over a courtyard to provide a roof for the servants. In the 1930s the artist Rex Whistler was a regular visitor to Plas Newydd. He painted numerous portraits of Lady Caroline Paget, and in 1936-38 painted the largest canvas painting in the UK. It is a trompe-l'oeil seascape painting that fills a whole wall of the dining room with an imagined scene of Italianate churches, castles, Snowdonian mountains and a complete <b>harbour</b> <b>wall,</b> with tricks of perspective that mean the scenes appear to change when seen from different parts of the room.|$|E

50|$|Between 1890 and 1892 {{and between}} 1895 and 1897, a harbour of two stone piers mostly made from granite, {{serpentine}} and elvan with a concrete core was constructed {{with the financial}} help of Lord Robartes of Lanhydrock both for coastal protection and to provide support and an economic base for fishermen, local farmers and local traders {{at a time when}} agriculture was going through a depression.

Although there was not enough throb from the engines to mar the absolute stillness, she came on at a fine speed, and within a few minutes was close to the boom. I had only time to run down to give orders to draw back the boom when she glided in and stopped dead at the <b>harbour</b> <b>wall.</b> Rooke steered her himself, and he says he never was on a boat that so well or so quickly answered her helm.
