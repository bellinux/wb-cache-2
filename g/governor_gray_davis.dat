5|$|Efforts were {{underway}} in 1997 to secure {{federal funding for}} the highway and other infrastructure near the Mexican border, largely supported by Senator Barbara Boxer and Representative Bob Filner, and Representative Bud Schuster, {{the chairman of the}} House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, visited the region before giving informal approval to the proposal. In 1999, <b>Governor</b> <b>Gray</b> <b>Davis</b> approved allocating $27million in federal funding to complete the freeway. Concerns were expressed by local residents and municipal officials regarding the apparent priority of SR125 over SR905 in terms of funding, especially since SR125 was to be constructed as a toll road, and SR905 would compete with the toll road enterprise. In May 1998, Congress approved $54million in funding for the completion of SR905.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps the {{heaviest}} point of controversy {{is the question}} of blame for the California electricity crisis. Former <b>Governor</b> <b>Gray</b> <b>Davis's</b> critics often charge that he did not respond properly to the crisis, while his defenders attribute the crisis to the power trading fraud and corporate accounting scandals and say that Davis did all he could considering the fact that the federal government, not states, regulate interstate power commerce.|$|R

25|$|Simultaneously {{with the}} Domestic Partnership Act of 1999, Assemblymember Carole Migden {{introduced}} Assembly Bill 26 of 1999. As originally drafted, it covered all adult couples, like its unsuccessful senate counterpart. Before bringing {{the bill to}} the Assembly floor, however, Migden narrowed its scope. Based on objections from <b>Governor</b> <b>Gray</b> <b>Davis,</b> {{who did not want}} a competing alternative to marriage for opposite-sex couples, Migden eliminated coverage for opposite-sex couples where either participant was less than 62 years of age. The bill passed, and Davis approved it on October 2, 1999. It provided for a public registry, hospital visitation rights, and authorized health insurance coverage for domestic partners of public employees.|$|E

The expanded rights included standing to sue (for emotional distress or wrongful death), stepparent adoption, a variety of conservatorship rights, the right to make health care decisions for an incapacitated partner, certain rights regarding distribution of a deceased partner’s estate, limited taxpayer rights, sick leave to care for partners, and unemployment and disability insurance benefits. <b>Governor</b> <b>Gray</b> <b>Davis</b> signed the bill into law on October 22, 2001.|$|E

25|$|Opponents {{of legal}} {{recognition}} for same-sex couples filed two lawsuits in the Superior Court of California. In the first case, state senator William “Pete” Knight sued <b>Governor</b> <b>Gray</b> <b>Davis</b> (later substituting Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger) {{on the grounds}} that A.B. 205 impermissibly amended Proposition 22, which Knight authored. Randy Thomasson (an opponent of gay rights and head of the Campaign for California Families) filed a similar lawsuit, which challenged both A.B. 205 and the earlier domestic-partner expansion in A.B. 25. Both lawsuits, consolidated into a single action, failed at the trial and appellate courts. In the wake of those decisions, opponents of legal recognition for LGBT families launched at least two recall efforts against Judge Loren McMaster, who presided over the trial-court hearings. The recall efforts also failed.|$|E

500|$|Solis was an {{environmental}} activist in the State Senate, due to concerns that {{stemmed from a}} childhood spent within smelling distance of the Puente Hills Landfill and making frequent visits to the San Gabriel Mountains. In 1997, she worked to pass environmental justice legislation with a law to protect low-income and minority communities from newly located landfills, pollution sources, and other environmental hazards in neighborhoods that already had such sites. She got the bill, SB 1113, approved over the strong opposition of various business interests, water contractors, and some state government agencies, but Wilson vetoed it. She returned in 1999 with a weakened measure, which was signed by <b>Governor</b> <b>Gray</b> <b>Davis.</b> Calling for [...] "the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and incomes {{with respect to the}} development, adoption, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws", it represented the first legislation {{of its kind in the}} nation and is considered a landmark.|$|E
40|$|Political strategists decide daily how {{to market}} their candidates. Growing {{recognition}} {{of the importance of}} implicit processes (processes occurring outside of awareness) suggests limitations to focus groups and polling, which rely on conscious self-report. Two experi-ments, inspired by national political campaigns, employed Internet-presented subliminal primes to study evaluations of politicians. In Experiment 1, the subliminal word “RATS” increased negative ratings of an unknown politician. In Experiment 2, conducted during former California <b>Governor</b> <b>Gray</b> <b>Davis’s</b> recall referendum, a subliminal photo of Clinton affected ratings of Davis, primarily among Independents. Results showed that subliminal stimuli can affect ratings of well-known as well as unknown politicians. Further, subliminal studies can be conducted in a mass media outlet (the Internet) in real time and supplement voter self-report, supporting the potential utility of implicit measures for campaign decision making...|$|R
