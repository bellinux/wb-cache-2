25|$|In {{the most}} basic form of <b>key</b> <b>recovery</b> through {{differential}} cryptanalysis, an attacker requests the ciphertexts for {{a large number of}} plaintext pairs, then assumes that the differential holds for at least r − 1 rounds, where r is the total number of rounds. The attacker then deduces which round keys (for the final round) are possible, assuming the difference between the blocks before the final round is fixed. When round keys are short, this can be achieved by simply exhaustively decrypting the ciphertext pairs one round with each possible round key. When one round key has been deemed a potential round key considerably more often than any other key, it is assumed to be the correct round key.|$|E

50|$|In June 2017, a {{vulnerability}} (CVE-2017-7526) {{was discovered}} in libgcrypt, a library used by GnuPG, which enabled a full <b>key</b> <b>recovery</b> for RSA-1024 and 1/8th of RSA-2048 keys. This side-channel attack exploits the fact that Libgcrypt used a sliding windows method for exponentiation which leads to the leakage of exponent bits and to full <b>key</b> <b>recovery.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} three contributions {{regarding the}} Soft Analytical Side-Channel Attacks (SASCA) introduced at Asiacrypt 2014. First, we {{compare them with}} Algebraic Side-Channel Attacks (ASCA) in a noise-free simulated setting. We observe that SASCA allow more efficient <b>key</b> <b>recoveries</b> than ASCA, even in this context (favorable to the latter). Second, we describe the first working experiments of SASCA against an actual AES implementation. Doing so, we analyse their profiling requirements, put forward the significant gains they provide over profiled Differential Power Analysis (DPA) in terms of number of traces needed for <b>key</b> <b>recoveries,</b> and discuss the specificities of such concrete attacks compared to simulated ones. Third, we evaluate the distance between SASCA and DPA enhanced with computational power to perform enumeration, and show that the gap between both attacks can be quite reduced in this case. Therefore, our results bring interesting feedback for evaluation laboratories. They suggest that in several relevant scenarios (e. g. attacks exploiting many known plaintexts), taking a small margin over the security level indicated by standard DPA with enumeration should be sufficient to prevent more elaborate attacks such as SASCA. By contrast, SASCA may remain the only option in more extreme scenarios (e. g. attacks with unknown plaintexts/ciphertexts or against leakage-resilient primitives). We conclude by recalling the algorithmic dependency of the latter attacks, and therefore that our conclusions are specific to the AES...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSecure {{implementations}} against side channel attacks usually combine {{hiding and}} masking protections in software implementations. In this work, {{we focus on}} desynchronization protection which is considered as a hiding countermeasure. The idea of desynchronization is to obtain a non-predictable offset of the attacking point {{in terms of time}} dimension. For this purpose, we present exploiting pattern-recognition methods to filter interesting points for obtaining a successful side channel attack. Using this tool as a case study, we completely cancel the desynchronization effect of the CHES 2009 / 2010 countermeasure [2, 3]. Moreover, 25 k traces are needed for a successful <b>key</b> <b>recoveries</b> in case of polymorphism-based countermeasure [4]...|$|R

US government regulations required any users of stronger 56-bit symmetric keys to submit to <b>key</b> <b>recovery</b> through algorithms like CDMF or key escrow, effectively reducing the key strength to 40-bit, and thereby allowing organisations such as the NSA to brute-force this encryption. Furthermore, from 1996 software products exported from the United States were not permitted to use stronger than 56-bit encryption, requiring different software editions for the US and export markets. In 1999, US allowed 56-bit encryption to be exported without key escrow or any other <b>key</b> <b>recovery</b> requirements.|$|E
