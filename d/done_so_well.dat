5|$|In polling, Dodd {{has seemed}} unable {{to break through}} to the top tier. In Nationwide polls he usually only polls at or around 1%. A November 7, 2007 Gallup poll placed him in last place, behind both Joe Biden and Dennis Kucinich at 1%. At the state level, Dodd has also not <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>well.</b> In a November 18, 2007 Iowa poll {{conducted}} by ABC news, he registered with 1% the same number from a similar poll done by ABC news on July 31, 2007. In New Hampshire, a poll conducted by CNN placed Dodd at 1% constant from a September poll but up from polls in June and July. However, on the straw poll level, Dodd was able to gain a victory during an event in South Carolina on March 5, 2007. He won the York County straw poll by receiving 28% of the 100 votes cast. Barack Obama came in second with 24%. Hillary Clinton got 18% and John Edwards received 11%. The victory came two days after Dodd visited the county which probably secured him the win.|$|E

500|$|Critics were {{generally}} positive when reviewing [...] "Eyes of the Insane". Stylus magazine's Cosmo Lee described the track as [...] "a dark, midpaced exploration of a soldier's psyche", and remarked that [...] "it's memorable {{and would be}} a good breather between the usual barnburners". Peter Atkinson of KNAC.com felt that [...] "'Eyes of the Insane' offers a post-traumatic sequel to 'Mandatory Suicide', again with a soundtrack that recalls the original, but boasting a couple truly mammoth hooks that do shake things up." [...] Don Kaye of Blabbermouth made a comparison to a different Slayer track than Atkinson, and commented that [...] "'Eyes of the Insane' and 'Catatonic' both have that slow, grinding feeling of doom that the band has <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> before on classics like 'Dead Skin Mask'." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} in trade publications. The Moving Picture World remarked that the play itself was not well-known, {{but that the}} plot was depicted adequately enough that it may encourage a re-perusal of the play. There was no fault found by the reviewer who stated, [...] "The characters of Hardcastle, Kate and Marlow are admirably done and seem to correctly interpret the original. The staging and costuming are {{in harmony with the}} play and reproduce the scenery of the time depicted with accuracy. The usefulness of a work of this sort does not end with the presentation of the play itself. There is an educational value which includes the costuming and reproduction of the surroundings of the time. These are so unfamiliar now that they afford not a little addition to the interest and pleasure of such a film. The work has been <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> that the company deserves commendation for undertaking the task. It is not an easy manner to reproduce a play of this character, and when it is well done the company performing it deserves praise." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror disagreed on almost all points, [...] "In numerous details the illusion is dispelled, for the scenery is manifestly not of the eighteenth century. No contemporary of Goldsmith ever rode in such a barouche as appears in this film, nor lived in such a house as Mr. Hardcastle. The final tableau is as artificial as set pieces which have gone out of style at funerals. With all of its imperfections there is considerable of virile comedy in the film." [...] Though the Mirror reviewer stated that despite the elimination of the Hastings and Constance Neville subplot, the acting is clear enough that audiences do not need prior knowledge of the play to appreciate the film.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Peter Bogdanovich's ex-wife Polly Platt, a film editor, {{had read}} Hill's script for Hickey & Boggs and {{recommended}} him to co-write The Getaway, which Bogdanovich {{was going to}} make with Steve McQueen. Bogdanovich and Hill worked on the script together in San Francisco while Bogdanovich was directing What's Up, Doc? Hill says that Bogdanovich was interested in making the film a more Hitchcock-type movie. They had completed 25 pages when they went back to L.A., whereupon McQueen fired Bogdanovich without reading any of their work. Sam Peckinpah came on to direct; Hill started from scratch and wrote his own script in six weeks. The resulting movie was a big hit which Hill later described [...] "of the films I wrote, I thought it was far and away the best one, and most interesting." [...] He said the success of the film [...] "was really how I got to be a director; the fact it had <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> put me in line to get a shot." ...|$|E

[...] Before Di's army could arrive, however, Ashina Mochuo completed his pillaging of the northern prefectures and withdrew; Di's army never engaged him. [...] Wu Zetian subsequently commissioned Di to tour the prefectures to pacify the people, and he was said to have <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>well,</b> helping refugees to return to their home, transporting food supplies to places needing them, repairing the roads, and helping the poor. [...] Fearful that other officials would trouble the people with demands for luxury items, he made a good example of eating unrefined foods and prohibiting harassment of the citizens. [...] Meanwhile, though, he was said to have looked down on Lou, not realizing that Lou had been the one that had recommended that he be made chancellor, until Wu Zetian revealed to him that fact, causing him to be embarrassed.|$|E

2500|$|Jagland {{launched}} {{his vision of}} the [...] "Norwegian House" [...] during his tenure as Prime Minister. In his speech to the Storting following his appointment, Jagland described the Norwegian House as a foundation with four pillars. The metaphor represented, [...] "the collective value creation within the ecologically sustainable society". The four pillars that hold up the house were business and labour policy; welfare policy; research and educational policy; and foreign and security policy. Jagland stated that everyone had something to contribute regarding the creation of the house; in particular he stated that the cabinet would cooperate with the opposition to reach these goals. In his speech, Jagland said that he would not deviate much from Harlem Brundtland's policies, but that he would increase the focus on violence, abuse of alcohol and drugs, and crime, including improvement of preventative measures and the courts. He also stated {{that it was important to}} introduce information technology in all parts of the education system. As part of the construction of the Norwegian House, the cabinet also started to appoint lay councils, with expertise within their fields, that would provide them with feedback and inputs on important areas in society. Jagland stated that the purpose was to allow critical voices close access to the political decisions, and increase the number of ideas generated at a political level. Jagland stated in August 2008 that, [...] "the Norwegian House could have been better planned and prepared, but I did not have the time. I took a chance. The Labour Party was down for the count. My goal was to make a good election; and we did. We have not <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> since". Jagland said in an interview, [...] "I still get letters from people who miss the Norwegian House. It was an attempt at something new, a building project that would also inspire the activity on the side of the parties".|$|E
