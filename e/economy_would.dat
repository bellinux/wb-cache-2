Much of the value-added of goods produced through fragmented value chains comes from other countries.

In addition, Nasser's adherence to neutralism regarding the Cold War, recognition of communist China, and arms deal with the Eastern bloc alienated the United States. On 19 July 1956, the US and UK abruptly withdrew their offer to finance construction of the Aswan Dam, citing concerns that Egypt's <b>economy</b> <b>would</b> be overwhelmed by the project.|$|E

However, this loss of revenue was often compensated by higher taxes levied on the merchants.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the {{relationship}} between price level and output was explained by the quantity theory of money; David Hume had presented such a theory in his 1752 work Of Money (Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary, Part II, Essay III). Quantity theory viewed the entire economy through Say's law, which stated that whatever is supplied to the market will be sold—in short, that markets always clear. In this view, money is neutral and cannot impact the real factors in an economy like output levels. This {{was consistent with the}} classical dichotomy view that real aspects of the economy and nominal factors, such as price levels and money supply, can be considered independent from one another. For example, adding more money to an <b>economy</b> <b>would</b> be expected only to raise prices, not to create more goods.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} England in the Middle Ages, from the Norman {{invasion}} in 1066, {{to the death}} of HenryVII in 1509, was fundamentally agricultural, though even before the invasion the market economy was important to producers. Norman institutions, including serfdom, were superimposed on an existing system of open fields and mature, well-established towns involved in international trade. Over the next five centuries the <b>economy</b> <b>would</b> at first grow and then suffer an acute crisis, resulting in significant political and economic change. Despite economic dislocation in urban and extraction economies, including shifts in the holders of wealth and the location of these economies, the economic output of towns and mines developed and intensified over the period. By the end of the period, England had a weak government, by later standards, overseeing an economy dominated by rented farms controlled by gentry, and a thriving community of indigenous English merchants and corporations.|$|E
5|$|With that said, honeybees perform {{some level}} of {{pollination}} of nearly 75% of all plant species directly used for human food worldwide. Catastrophic loss of honeybees could have significant impact, therefore; {{it is estimated that}} seven out of the 60 major agricultural crops in North American <b>economy</b> <b>would</b> be lost, and this is only for one region of the world. Farms that have intensive systems (high density of crops) will be impacted the most compared to non-intensive systems (small local gardens that depend on wild bees) because of dependence on honeybees. These types of farms have a high demand for honeybee pollination services, which in the U.S. alone costs $1.25 billion annually. This cost is offset, however, as honeybees as pollinators generate 22.8 to 57 billion Euros globally.|$|E

5|$|The Lincoln-Liberty Building, {{completed}} in 1932, {{was intended to}} partly house a large men's department store and offices. The building's cornerstone was set on October 1, 1932 with a ceremony attended by William L. Nevin and Wanamaker executives from New York City, Paris and London. The Wanamaker Men's Store opened on October 12, 1932, with four Wanamaker buglers blowing a reveille and the ringing of the building's Founders Bell. Opening during the Great Depression, Nevin said the new building {{was a sign of}} the store's faith that the <b>economy</b> <b>would</b> improve. Intended to rival European department stores in size and selection, the men's store ordered US$2,000,000 worth of merchandise and was the largest store {{of its kind in the}} world. As early as 1939 there were rumors the men's store would close, but Wanamaker's would not close the store unless a replacement tenant would agree to rent the space. When a new tenant was ready to take the store's place in the 1950s, the men's store was relocated to the Wanamaker Building down the street.|$|E

3000|$|... “GDPC” is {{the real}} per capita income. It acts {{as a proxy for}} countries’ overall {{development}} level. On the one hand, we expect that countries with higher development levels would be better equipped, including in terms of skills and institutional sophistication (for example, strong capacity of the tax administration to collect public revenue) to negotiate better contracts with resource-seeking multinationals (MNEs). Thus, advanced <b>economies</b> <b>would</b> be able to collect higher resource revenue than less advanced economies. On the other hand, as resource revenue is not a sustainable source of public revenue, advanced <b>economies</b> <b>would</b> be willing to diversify their public revenue sources, including away from resource revenue to non-resource revenue. In particular, tax administrations in developed countries compared to less advanced economies have the requisite capacity and skills to diversify the sources of their resource revenue, from resource revenue towards non-resource revenue. Therefore, we expect countries with lower development levels to experience a lower extent of the change in the structure of public revenue from resource revenue to non-resource revenue, i.e., a decline in their ratio of resource revenue to non-resource revenue.|$|R
