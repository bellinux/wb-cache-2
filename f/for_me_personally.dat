When asked about his experience with making songs for No Name Face {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Wade said, [...] "DreamWorks has been amazing in letting us make the record. They're super-artist-friendly. They let us make our record the way we wanted to make it. It's the best label we could be on." [...] In an interview with MTV Radio, Wade explained the message behind [...] "Sick Cycle Carousel" [...] and said, [...] "It's one of those songs I'm really afraid to put an explanation to as far as what it's about <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>personally.</b> I don't want it to lose its mystery and mystique. Everyone interprets it differently. It's funny hearing people telling what's it's about to them because then I can go, 'Maybe that's what it's about.' It's got a weird mystique to me still."

500|$|After {{abandoning the}} soundtrack album, Bowie went on tour {{in support of}} Station to Station, commencing 2 February 1976 and {{completing}} on 18 May 1976. Kraftwerk's [...] "Radioactivity" [...] was employed as an overture to the shows, accompanying footage from Luis Buñuel's and Salvador Dalí's surrealist film Un Chien Andalou. The staging featured Bowie, dressed in the Duke's habitual black waistcoat and trousers, a pack of Gitanes placed ostentatiously in his pocket, moving stiffly among [...] "curtains of white light", an effect that spawned the nickname 'the White Light Tour'. In 1989 Bowie reflected, [...] "I {{wanted to go back}} to a kind of Expressionist German-film look... and the lighting of, say, Fritz Lang or Pabst. A black-and-white movies look, but with an intensity that was sort of aggressive. I think <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>personally,</b> theatrically, that was the most successful tour I've ever done." [...] The Station to Station tour was the source of one of the artist's best-known bootlegs, culled from an FM radio broadcast of his 23 March 1976 concert at Nassau Coliseum. A live album was officially released years later.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and American record {{producer}} Jude Cole and was produced by Lifehouse and Jude Cole at Ironworks Studio in Los Angeles. In an interview with The San Bernardino Sun, Wade talked about making songs on the album and said, [...] "This time around it was not about having any preconceived notions. It was about letting the tape machine roll and getting the music down spontaneously." [...] When asked about {{the message of the}} song, Wade said, [...] "I think the main message of this song, at least <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>personally</b> when I was writing the lyrics, is just how difficult it can be to be in a relationship. Sometimes, you do things to disappoint the other person. Letting someone down and trying to repair a relationship that you feel is kind of slipping through your hands a bit." [...] "Whatever It Takes" [...] was originally released with the band's fourth studio album, Who We Are, on June 18, 2007 and was officially solicited as a single to mainstream radio on November 13, 2007.|$|E

500|$|Bataan {{surrendered}} on 9 April, and Corregidor on 6 May. George Marshall {{decided that}} MacArthur would be awarded the Medal of Honor, a decoration {{for which he}} had twice previously been nominated, [...] "to offset any propaganda by the enemy directed at his leaving his command". [...] Eisenhower pointed out that MacArthur had not actually performed any acts of valor as required by law, but Marshall cited the 1927 award of the medal to Charles Lindbergh as a precedent. Special legislation had been passed to authorize Lindbergh's medal, but while similar legislation was introduced authorizing the medal for MacArthur by Congressmen J. Parnell Thomas and James E. Van Zandt, Marshall felt strongly that a serving general should receive the medal from the President and the War Department. MacArthur chose to accept it on the basis that [...] "this award was intended not so much <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>personally</b> as it is a recognition of the indomitable courage of the gallant army which it was my honor to command." [...] Arthur and Douglas MacArthur thus became the first father and son to be awarded the Medal of Honor. They remained the only pair until 2001, when Theodore Roosevelt was awarded posthumously for his service during the Spanish–American War, Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. having received one posthumously for his service during World War II.

500|$|Despite general favor from female viewers' perspective, {{reaction}} from most male viewers was negative. The music video {{was presented to}} a crowd during a promotional party at the Chelsea nightclub Centro-Fly, thrown in celebration of Voodoos January 2000 release. According to a New York Times correspondent, one female viewer at the party [...] "recalled sitting at home, staring at the video, while her boyfriend snapped, 'Turn the channel — I don't {{want to see that}} gay stuff'". D'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video. Tracy Cloherty, program director for the radio station at the time, later commented on the divided reaction to the music video in an interview for The New York Times in 2000, stating [...] "Of course, most of the women loved it. Some of the men said things like: 'We don't wanna see that kind of stuff. Why do {{we have to look at}} that?' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity". Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia. In a 2000 phone interview for The New York Times, D'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video, stating [...] "With men, if there's any negative reaction, I'm not really going to get an honest feedback ... women love it, most definitely. But <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>personally,</b> the response I've got from both men and women has been pretty cool".|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} and release of Neighborhoods was delayed multiple times. The recording's delay {{was due to}} the way the band chose to work — in bits and pieces, alone and together, in a pair of California studios — in addition to each member's busy schedules. The album was recorded at both DeLonge's studio in San Diego and in Los Angeles by Hoppus and Barker. [...] Recording in separate studios was DeLonge's idea, and ideas were exchanged via e-mail. Various engineers met up in person to trade files on hard drives. Although the three musicians were rarely in the same room while recording, opting to work on their parts individually, DeLonge asserted that the method of recording was a more efficient way of working considering the schedules, not {{due to a lack of}} unity within the band. In addition, Barker was releasing a solo record, DeLonge was involved in Angels & Airwaves, and Hoppus had to fly to New York City once a week to film his television show, Hoppus on Music. The record was the band's first to be self-produced, due to the death of long-time producer Jerry Finn in 2008. Not only did Finn helm their last three studio albums, but he served as an invaluable member of the band: part adviser, part impartial observer, he helped smooth out tensions and hone their sound. [...] "I honestly still feel like he’s in the studio with us, because <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>personally,</b> everything that was about {{recording and}} being in a studio, I learned from Jerry," [...] said Hoppus. Instead of a producer, each band member had their own dedicated sound engineer. DeLonge, who was against using a producer after self-producing most of his Angels & Airwaves records, described the band situation as [...] "very democratic," [...] noting that he learned during the recording process to [...] "let go and be okay with not being able to control everything." ...|$|E
