Using sample path methods {{and the notion of}} majorization, we analyze the effect that parameters such as the token buffer capacity and token generation period have on the vector of interdeparture times. In the transient case, we establish the monotonicity of the burst reduction {{in the sense of the}} majorization. In the case that the departure process is asymptotically mean stationary and ergodic, the transient comparison results allow us to establish the monotonicity of the stationary interdeparture times in the sense of the convex ordering.

The specific case discussed here of <b>DG</b> <b>XIII</b> of the European Commission responsible for telecommunications provides an example of attempts by a regulatory agency to broaden the scope of its regulatory reach.

The article discusses the ensuing reactions to this intervention.

40|$|Teletraining aims at the {{innovation}} of training incorporate environments. Flexible learning independent {{of time and}} location should be made possible without giving up direct communication between learners and with teachers {{as it is known}} in the most famous variant of technology based learning, Computer Based Training (CBT). The Commission of the European Community (<b>DG</b> <b>XIII)</b> promotes research, development and the Pan European implementation of telematic systems for flexible and distance learning in a special programme (DELTA). The biggest application project in DELTA, directly aiming at the market, is the Multimedia Teleschool (MTS). Within this project, employees should learn languages together and should gain technical knowledge by cross-border and cross-company communications. The learners are instructed by tutors in centralised training centres of different European distance learning institutes. The technical core of the Teleschool is a computer-conferencing system as well as live TV programmes broadcasted via satellite (DBS), in which the locally distributed learners directly have the possibility - also by video phone - to intervene. Berlitz language courses running for six months are the main focus of applications. The principal customers of these courses are DBP Telekom and France Telecom. The research group technology assessment of WIK evaluates all MTS-courses in terms of acceptance, implementation and costs. After {{the first phase of the}} courses, WIK in its role as formative evaluator organized an exchange of experiences between all actors involved. On the implementation-workshop whose results are published here, user organizations pointed out their implementation problems and course providers gave their solution strategies. The problems of designing interactive TV programmes were described separately and were contrasted with a demanding Multipoint-Videoconference training configuration - the IBM Tele-Academy. On the one hand, the WIK-evaluators outlined the chances and challenges which teletraining offers when the usage of technological potentials is followed consequently, on the other hand they gave some practical hints for the solving of concrete MTS-implementation problems. The reports and the discussions emphasize that the introduction of teletraining in corporate environments is a complex socio-technical process substantially challenging the traditional training practice and involving many motivational, organisational and technical restrictions. Adaptations of the technical and pedagogical configuration of the Teleschool to the requirements and demands of user organisations are necessary. Only the permanent readiness of all actors for organisational learning can lead to a market uptake. Some MTS-courses still have too serious deficits that the search for better alternatives can be finished already at this stage. Offering telecommunication mediated training as a personal service with guaranteed flexibility and a high variety of media is a challenge which should not be underestimated.

The MTS teletraining courses were mainly based on self-study with traditional print and audio media, and on text-based computer conferencing. This was completed by interactive TV broadcasts, with live-feedback from the remote learning sites e. g. via video-conferencing connections. The evaluation findings show that the challenges of teletraining are often underestimated by the employees as well as by their companies. In addition to learning, the participants have to cope with technical and organisational start-up problems, they have to get familiar with new learning technologies and they have to integrate their learning activities into their daily working schedule. Nevertheless, the learners were very interested and motivated to use the innovative learning technologies. Time constraints, because of the parallel learning and work activities, showed to be the main problem for successful course participation. The majority of the learners decided to shift most of their learning activities into their leisure time. The results indicate, that the teletraining learners valued flexibility higher than interactivity and tended to prefer isolated self-learning with individual tutor support to intensive and time-consuming group and collaborative learning, when confronted with a limited time budget. Flexibility and individual tutoring were perceived as the major profits of the teletraining courses by the participants. In the conferencing system {{as well as in the}} interactive TV programmes, the majority of the teletraining participants tended to passive behaviour and had to be encouraged to take over a more active role in the course. Although the level of participation was limited in the MTS language courses, the findings show that the participants, after some exercising and practice, are able to develop new and adequate communication skills for the use of telematic technologies in further training. With an adequate time schedule and some support by tutors and co-ordinators, they perceive a benefit from flexibility as well as from group and interculturat communication. The evaluation results in the MTS project show, that there is no optimal teletraining scenario with an optimal technology configuration. The success and the acceptance of teletraining depends on whether learning technology is implemented in a supportive and flexible learning environment, that is responsive to the participants' needs and abilities. The majority of the learners still regards face-to-face training (individually or in groups) as the optimal training method - especially for language training - that cannot be substituted by teletraining. ' (author's abstract) 'Teletraining wird von vielen Unternehmen als kostensparende bzw. effizienzsteigernde Alternative zur betrieblichen Weiterbildung angesehen. Eine wichtige Voraussetzung fuer den Erfolg des computergestuetzten Fernlernens ist die Akzeptanz bei den Beschaeftigten. Die Frage nach der Akzeptanz war deshalb einer der Schwerpunkte der umfangreichen Begleitforschung zu dem 1992 - 1994 von der EU gefoerderten Teletraining-Projekt 'Multimedia Teleschool' (MTS). Ca. 300 Beschaeftigte aus europaeischen Unternehmen nahmen im Lauf des Projektes an Sprachkursen teil, die u. a. Gruppenlernen in Computerkonferenzen und interaktive TV-Sendungen umfassten. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die hohen Anforderungen von Teletraining an die Motivation und Lernkompetenz der Teilnehmer ebenso wie die technischen und organisatorischen Probleme waehrend der Einfuehrungsphase, haeufig unterschaetzt werden. Das interaktive Lernen in Computerkonferenzen stellte eine besondere Herausforderung fuer die Teilnehmer dar, da es ein aktives Lern- und Kommunikationsverhalten erfordert, das von vielen erst entwickelt werden musste. Die Sprachkursteilnehmer zeigten grosses Interesse an computergestuetztem Fernlernen, eine hohe Lernbereitschaft und akzeptierten auch eine Verlagerung der Lernaktivitaeten in ihre private Freizeit. Flexibles Lernen und die individuelle tutorielle Betreuung wurden als entscheidende Vorteile des Telelernens wahrgenommen. Sie muessen durch geeignete Lernmaterialien, paedagogische Konzepte sowie Curricula ermoeglicht und unterstuetzt werden. Teletraining ist aus Sicht der Lernenden kein Ersatz fuer Praesenzschulungen, sondern wird als sinnvolle Ergaenzung oder auch vorteilhaftere Alternative erkannt, wenn ein geeignetes Lernumfeld es ermoeglicht, die Lernaktivitaeten besser an individuelle Anforderungen und Wuensche anzupassen.
