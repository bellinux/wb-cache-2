50|$|<b>Etaracizumab</b> (also {{known as}} etaratuzumab, MEDI-522, trade name Abegrin) is a humanized {{monoclonal}} antibody {{which is being}} investigated {{for the treatment of}} metastatic melanoma, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer and various other types of cancer. It is manufactured by MedImmune.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe αvβ 3 {{integrin}} {{is expressed}} on proliferating endothelial cells and some cancer cells, but its expression on ovarian cancer cells {{and its potential}} as a therapeutic target are unknown. In this study, expression of the αvβ 3 integrin on ovarian cancer cell lines and murine endothelial cells was tested, {{and the effect of}} a fully humanized monoclonal antibody against αvβ 3, Abegrin (<b>etaracizumab),</b> on cell invasion, viability, tumor growth, and the Akt pathway were examined in vitro and in vivo. We found that <b>etaracizumab</b> recognizes αvβ 3 on the ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV 3 ip 1, HeyA 8, and A 2780 ip 2 (at low levels) but not on murine endothelial cells. <b>Etaracizumab</b> treatment decreased ovarian cancer proliferation and invasion. In vivo, tumor-bearing mice treated with <b>etaracizumab</b> alone gave variable results. There was no effect on A 2780 ip 2 growth, but a 36 % to 49 % tumor weight reduction in the SKOV 3 ip 1 and HeyA 8 models was found (P <. 05). However, combined <b>etaracizumab</b> and paclitaxel was superior to paclitaxel in the SKOV 3 ip 1 and A 2780 ip 2 models (by 51 – 73 %, P <. 001) but not in the HeyA 8 model. Treatment with <b>etaracizumab</b> was then noted to decrease p-Akt and p-mTOR in SKOV 3 ip 1, but not in HeyA 8, which is Akt-independent. Tumors resected after therapy showed that <b>etaracizumab</b> treatment reduced the proliferating cell nuclear antigen index but not microvessel density. This study identifies tumor cell αvβ 3 integrin as an attractive target and defines the Akt pathway as a predictor of response to function-blocking antibody...|$|E
