40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Master of Business Administration, 2016. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 19). This report on the service delivery of Lisky technology Services was prepared {{as part of the}} course requirement for Service Marketing, under the Masters of Business Administration at BRAC University. This extensively explores the service delivery process of Lisky technology Services. It is prepared using different service marketing theories learned {{during the course of the}} current academic semester. In order to make my report more effective <b>I</b> <b>contacted</b> <b>with</b> respondents to analyze and better comprehend the factors that influence the service quality of Lisky technology Services. Our survey had a sample size of many respondents. The objective of the survey was to determine the quality of services Lisky technology provides to its customers in order to increase the level of customer satisfaction. The survey results were then interpreted and the findings were used in preparing the various concepts that are discussed in the report. Then I analyzed customers’ expectations and perceptions towards the services from Lisky technology. Here it was found that the service experience often did not live up to the expectation. I also looked at Lisky technology’s service recovery strategies, as well as the process by which the company designs and develops new services. In the next section, I analyzed Lisky technology’s Service Development & Design. Discussion included how their service is designed to the implementation phase. Next, I explored the Integrated Service Marketing Communication of Lisky technology. Few options were put forward regarding the IMC program for Lisky technology. In the final section, I presented some suggestions to Lisky technology about how they should move forward to further enhance their service. My overall findings appeared to indicate that Lisky technology is surviving on the strength of its reputation. As an old and established company it managed to attract new customers largely through word of mouth. This would indicate that it has a decent number of repeat customers. However, this is not a sustainable strategy, and if Lisky technology is to remain relevant in a rapidly changing business landscape, it must evolve and adapt. It must learn how to leverage new technologies and media to increase customer awareness, and more importantly it must focus more on improving customer satisfaction and loyalty in the long run.

40|$|Attention Restoration Theory {{suggests}} that <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> nature supports attentional functioning, {{and a number}} of studies have found <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> everyday nature to be related to attention in adults. <b>Is</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> everyday nature also related to the attentional functioning of children? This question was addressed through a study focusing on children with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). This study examined the relationship between children's nature exposure through leisure activities and their attentional functioning using both within and between-subjects comparisons. Parents were surveyed regarding their child's attentional functioning after activities in several settings. Results indicate that children function better than usual after activities in green settings and that the 'greener' a child's play area, the less severe his or her attention deficit symptoms. Thus, <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> nature may support attentional functioning in a population of children who desperately need attentional support...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Treating “resting ” <b>contacts</b> (<b>i.</b> e., <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> zero normal {{relative}} velocity), using {{forces is}} problematic due to inconsistent configurations. For this reason, treating resting <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> impulses instead of forces has become common, but this approach also {{suffers from a}} significant problem: applying impulses at the time-of-contact can keep the simulation from advancing. This scenario is analogous {{to one of the}} paradoxes devised by the philosopher Zeno, and has been referred to as a Zeno point in the simulation community. I describe how to avoid Zeno points without violating the theoretical dynamic behavior of the simulated bodies and without permitting interpenetration. Two experiments demonstrate that the method works as desired where alternative approaches that required accepting interpenetration or longer running times were previously required. I...|$|R
