25|$|The good king Gontrand {{first took}} a {{concubine}} Veneranda, a slave belonging {{to one of}} his people, by whom he had a son Gundobad. Later he married Marcatrude, daughter of Magnar, and sent his son Gundobad to Orléans. But after she had a son Marcatrude was jealous, and proceeded to bring about Gundobad's death. She sent poison, they say, and poisoned <b>his</b> <b>drink.</b> <b>And</b> upon his death, by God's judgment she lost the son she had and incurred the hate of the king, was dismissed by him, and died not long after. After her he took Austerchild, also named Bobilla. He had by her two sons, of whom the older was called Clothar and the younger Chlodomer.|$|E
25|$|As the {{deadline}} nears, the LBA executives begin to panic and lash out, {{resulting in a}} contradictory sequence where Wolfe is fired and then rehired within a span of minutes. When all seems lost, however, an anonymous source sends copies of the answers {{to each of the}} contestants, thus voiding the contest and saving LBA. Although Archie, the LBA executives and the police suspect Wolfe of doing so, he insists that he was not responsible, and begins to suspect one of the advertising executives of at least stealing the wallet, if not murdering Dahlmann. After the letters are sent, Vernon Assa approaches Wolfe and attempts to unilaterally dismiss him from the case, but Wolfe refuses. His suspicions aroused, Wolfe summons the major players to his office and claims he will reveal the identity of the thief, and in doing so provide the police with vital information to help them identify the murderer. Before he can do so, however, Vernon Assa is poisoned with cyanide surreptitiously slipped into <b>his</b> <b>drink</b> <b>and</b> dies on the floor of Wolfe's office. Dahlmann's wallet is found in his pocket, suggesting that he was the thief and murderer.|$|E
500|$|In January 2014, Roberts joined Welsh Premier League side Gap Connah's Quay. The [...] "Nomads" [...] {{finished}} tenth in 2013–14. He {{signed with}} Maltese Premier League side Mosta in January 2015. He returned to England {{later in the}} year to play for Witton Albion in the Northern Premier League Division One North, and left the club upon the expiry of his contract on 31 December. In June 2016, Roberts returned to the Welsh Premier League to play for Bangor City. He signed a contract extension four months later. The [...] "Citizens" [...] finished in fourth-place in 2016–17, and qualified for the UEFA Europa League after beating Cardiff Metropolitan University 1–0 in the play-off final; Roberts said [...] "It means everything to the club [...] We’ve worked hard as a unit, not just the players but all the staff". He credited the club with turning his life around and helping him to overcome <b>his</b> <b>drink</b> <b>and</b> gambling problems. However he left the club in July 2017 after having his contract cancelled; Bangor City made a statement to say [...] "when a player states in the week leading up to a massive European game that he no longer wants to play for the club, we were left with no alternative other than to release him from his contract. We wish him well for the future, and hope that one day he realises what a massive opportunity he has given up." ...|$|E

50|$|The Hadith above {{describes}} {{a man who}} earned his money by cheating other people. His money was impure so therefore everything he purchased with his money became impure. <b>His</b> clothes, <b>drink,</b> <b>and</b> food were all purchased with that money which was considered impure, so <b>his</b> clothes, <b>drink</b> <b>and</b> food were all considered impure. According to the above hadith, in Islam a person's du'a will not be accepted by God if he earns unlawful money.|$|R

In the aftermath of the recording, Marston finishes <b>his</b> <b>drink</b> <b>and</b> immediately dies from cyanide poisoning. The remaining guests notice that one of the ten figurines is now broken, and the nursery rhyme appears to reflect the manner of death ("One choked his little self and then there were nine").|$|E

50|$|This ballad {{tells the}} story of a beggar who was born lame and has a wooden leg. The beggar sings of <b>his</b> food, <b>his</b> <b>drinks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> dog. He sings of going to Pimlico with his fellow beggars, where they will all have drinks with girls. He brags of his skills as a beggar, and his ability to evoke pity in others. He lives in a {{hollowed}} out tree, and wonders why anybody would be a king when a beggar's life is so good.|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{but this}} {{assurance}} could have prevailed upon the small nurse {{to indulge in}} such a luxury.

60|$|Huntley {{took the}} hint, {{finished}} <b>his</b> <b>drink,</b> <b>and</b> departed. Saton {{sat for a}} few more minutes alone. Then he too went out into the street, and walked slowly homewards. He let himself into the house in Regent's Park with his latchkey, and went thoughtfully upstairs. The room was still brilliantly illuminated, and the woman who was sitting over the fire, turned round to greet him.|$|E
60|$|This gentleman had {{established}} himself {{very early in}} the evening in this apartment, where, saying he was confoundedly thirsty, he called for a bottle of champagne.

25|$|Rum {{started to}} play an {{important}} role in the political system; candidates attempted to influence the outcome of an election through their generosity with rum. The people would attend the hustings to see which candidate appeared more generous. The candidate was expected to drink with the people to show he was independent and truly a republican. In the 1833 Mississippi state senate election, one candidate, Judge Edward Turner, poured <b>his</b> <b>drinks</b> <b>and</b> socialized with the people. He was more personal and it appeared as if he was going to win. The other candidate, a Methodist parson named Dick Stewart, announced he would not be pouring their <b>drinks</b> <b>and</b> they could have as much as they wanted; Dick Stewart won.|$|R
50|$|As an 8-year-old, Hazes {{is ordered}} by his {{aggressive}} father Joop {{to sing in}} pubs and at markets. Joop uses the collected money to buy <b>his</b> <b>drinks</b> <b>and</b> even forces <b>his</b> son to <b>drink</b> beer. One day the famous John Kraaijkamp Sr. hears André singing at the Albert Cuyp Market. He tries to convince Joop to have André on national television. Joop is not impressed; he thinks that his other son sings much better, until he finds out about the financial benefits. The performance is a success and subsequently Hazes records two duets with Kraaijkamp (Droomschip and Guanita) for single-release; it makes no impact.|$|R

"ANECDOTE OF HIS MAJESTY.--At {{the review}} of troops (Police) yesterday, his Majesty, going up to one old grognard and pulling him by the ear, said, 'Wilt thou have a cross or another ration of wine?'

Before {{he had made}} more than a blot, he suddenly started up, impelled by the impact of an idea colliding with his consciousness. He stood upon his feet and swayed back and forth before them, reflecting in his startled eyes the thought process that was taking place behind. Then he reached his conclusion. A benevolent radiance suffused his countenance. He turned to the faro dealer, took his hand, and spoke solemnly.|$|E

[...] And Mr. Moulder in the excitement of the moment puffed hard at his pipe, took a long pull at <b>his</b> <b>drink,</b> <b>and</b> dragged open his waistcoat.

60|$|At last, {{dinner was}} over; the things were taken away, they both drew their chairs over the fire, {{and began the}} {{business}} of the evening--the making and consumption of punch. Barry had determined to begin upon the subject which lay so near his heart, at eight o'clock. He had thought it better to fix an exact hour, and had calculated that the whole matter might be completed before Colligan went over to the inn. He kept continually looking at his watch, and gulping down <b>his</b> <b>drink,</b> <b>and</b> thinking over and over again how he would begin the conversation.|$|E
60|$|I {{remained}} {{a very long}} time upon the roof, wondering at the grotesque changes of the day. I recalled my mental states from the midnight prayer to the foolish card-playing. I had a violent revulsion of feeling. I remember I flung away the cigar with a certain wasteful symbolism. My folly came to me with glaring exaggeration. I seemed a traitor to my wife and to my kind; I was filled with remorse. I resolved to leave this strange undisciplined dreamer of great things to <b>his</b> <b>drink</b> <b>and</b> gluttony, and to go on into London. There, it seemed to me, I had the best chance of learning what the Martians and my fellowmen were doing. I was still upon the roof when the late moon rose.|$|E
