5|$|The {{proposed}} redefinition was criticised as ambiguous: Astronomer Phil Plait and NCSE writer Nick Matzke both {{wrote about}} why they thought the redefinition was not, in general, a good one. It defined a planet as orbiting a star, which would have meant that any planet ejected from its star system or formed outside of one (a rogue planet) {{could not have been}} called a planet, even if it <b>fit</b> <b>all</b> other definitions. A similar situation already applied to the term 'moon', such bodies ceasing to be moons on being ejected from planetary orbit; this usage had widespread acceptance. Similarly, the redefinition did not differentiate between planets and brown dwarf stars. Any attempt to clarify this differentiation was to be left until a later date.|$|E
5|$|The ship's air {{group was}} {{originally}} intended to consist of 12 Mitsubishi A5M 'Claude' fighters, plus four in storage, 18 Aichi D3A 'Val' dive bombers, plus two in reserve, and 18 Nakajima B5N 'Kate' torpedo bombers. This was revised to substitute a dozen Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, and three in storage for the A5Ms {{by the time the}} ship commissioned in 1942. As a result of the lessons learned from the Battle of Midway in June, the ship's fighter complement was strengthened to 21 Zeros, and the other aircraft reduced to 12 D3As and 9 B5Ns. By the end of the year, six more Zeros replaced an equal number of D3As. Although it was possible to <b>fit</b> <b>all</b> these aircraft into the hangars, eight or nine were usually stored on the flight deck to reduce cramping below decks.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the planned refit of HMS Eagle {{to allow her to}} operate the Phantom, a total of 20 airframes that had originally been ordered for the Fleet Air Arm were diverted to the Royal Air Force to serve in the air defence role. At the time, the RAF's primary interceptor was the English Electric Lightning, which suffered badly both in terms of range, loiter time and weapons <b>fit,</b> <b>all</b> of which hampered its effectiveness, especially in long interceptions of Soviet Air Forces and Soviet Naval Aviation bombers and reconnaissance aircraft over the North Sea and North Atlantic. So a new Phantom squadron was formed at RAF Leuchars, the UK's most northerly air defence base at the time, {{to take advantage of the}} improvements that the Phantom provided over the Lightning – it could carry more fuel, and could thus fly further for longer; it was fitted with a more powerful radar; and it could carry more missiles (up to 8, compared to 2 for the Lightning). On 1 September 1969, 43 Squadron was formed at Leuchars, operating as part of the UK's northern QRA zone alongside the Lightnings of 11 Squadron and 23 Squadron until, in 1972, 11Squadron was redeployed to join 5 Squadron at RAF Binbrook and was replaced by the Royal Navy Phantoms of the Phantom Training Flight (PTF) and 892 Naval Air Squadron.|$|E

5|$|Loxton {{had scored}} 203 runs in three innings {{at an average}} of 101.50, but was not selected, nor was middle-order batsman Harvey, who had scored a century in the {{previous}} Test against India. Harvey struggled to adapt to English conditions at the start of his first tour and made only 83 runs at 16.60 in five innings on tour. Brown, who had scored 527 runs at 75.28 for the season so far, including three centuries in his last three innings, was played out of position in the middle-order, even though he had batted as an opener in every tour match other than against Worcestershire. Due to the rotation policy in the tour matches, only two of the three openers Brown, Morris and Barnes played in any one game while the other rested, except when Bradman tried to <b>fit</b> <b>all</b> three in a full-strength team by having Brown in the middle-order. The team was exactly the same as for the opening fixture against Worcestershire.|$|E

25|$|The only {{modification}} {{which did}} deliver any noticeable benefit was the fitting of 92178 {{with a double}} blastpipe and chimney during its construction. Following delivery in September 1957, it was subjected to extensive testing, both in the Rugby test plant and on service trains. After {{the completion of the}} tests in February 1958, it was decided to <b>fit</b> <b>all</b> 9Fs built subsequently with double blastpipes and chimneys; these were numbers 92183 onwards, also 92165–7.

25|$|The Mac Mini is an {{entry-level}} computer intended for budget-minded customers. Until the 2011 release, the Mac Mini had much less processing power {{than the other}} computers of the Macintosh lineup. Unlike regular desktop computers, which use standard-sized components such as 3.5-inch hard drives and full-size DIMM's, Apple uses lower-power laptop components in the Mac Mini to <b>fit</b> <b>all</b> the necessary components into the small case and to prevent overheating. Previously, with the choice of components on the older models, the machine was considered somewhat slower than standard desktop computers. It also had less storage and memory than comparable desktops. However, the 2011 upgrade addressed many of these previous complaints.|$|E
25|$|Though it did {{represent}} {{a complex and}} gradual change in the shopping and self-presentation habits of both men and women, the idea of metrosexuality was often distilled in the media down to a few men and a short checklist of vanities, like skin care products, scented candles and costly, colorful dress shirts and pricey designer jeans. It was this image of the metrosexual—that of a straight young man who got pedicures and facials, practiced aromatherapy and spent freely on clothes—that contributed to a backlash against the term from men who merely wanted to feel free to take more care with their appearance than had been the norm in the 1990s, when companies abandoned dress codes, Dockers khakis became a popular brand, and XL, or extra-large, became the one size that <b>fit</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E

25|$|The South Ferry station, {{which serves}} the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line exclusively, has two tracks and one island {{platform}}, {{and is the}} only IRT platform currently in use.

This station was built as a replacement for the loop station, which was relegated to being used for turn-arounds once the new station opened. Unlike the loop station, this station only can access IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line local trains, and does not connect with the Lexington Avenue Line. It allows 24 trains per hour (or one every 2 minutes and 30 seconds) to terminate at the station.|$|E
25|$|Tatian's harmony {{follows the}} gospels closely {{in terms of}} text but, in order to <b>fit</b> <b>all</b> the {{canonical}} material in, he created his own narrative sequence, which is different from both the synoptic sequence and John's sequence; and occasionally creates intervening time periods that are found in none of the source accounts. This sequence is coherent and consistent within itself, but not necessarily consistent with that in all {{or any of the}} separate canonical gospels; and Tatian apparently applies the same principle in respect of the narrative itself. Where the gospels differ from one another in respect of the details of an event or teaching; the Diatessaron resolves such apparent contradictions by selecting one or another alternative wording and adding consistent details from the other gospels; while omitting apparent duplicate matter, especially across the synoptics. Hence, in respect of the healing of the blind at Jericho the Diatessaron reports only one blind man, Bartimeaus, healed by Jesus when leaving the city according to the account in Mark 10:46ff (expanded with phrases from Luke 18:36-37); consequently omitting any separate mention of two unnamed blind men healed by Jesus leaving Jericho (Matthew 20:29ff), and also the healing by Jesus entering Jericho the previous day of a single unnamed blind man (Luke 18:35ff).|$|E
25|$|Following {{the defeat}} of the Bahrag and the Bohrok's return to their nests, the Toa Nuva collect their new Kanohi Nuva masks and return to their villages to help in the {{reconstruction}} after the damage the swarms caused. However, six new elite Bohrok - the Bohrok-Kal - appear with the intention of releasing the Bahrag so the Bohrok may swarm again. Each Kal steals a Nuva symbol tablet, robbing the heroes of their command of the elements. Relying solely on their mask powers and combat skills, the Toa Nuva chase the Bohrok-Kal all over Mata Nui and eventually find them in the Bahrag's underground nest. The Kal defeat the Exo-Toa guards with ease before attempting to <b>fit</b> <b>all</b> six plaques onto the Nuva cube in order to re-awake the swarm queens. Before the tablets join, Tahu unleashes a secret weapon: the Kanohi Vahi - the legendary Mask of Time - to slow down time around them. Though unable to directly attack the Kal, the gambit buys the Toa time to devise a new strategy. Using their connections to their tablets, they feed energy into the elite Bohrok, making them believe that their power alone can cleanse the island. However, the Kal's powers soon run wild and destroy them. The Toa Nuva exit the nest, and after hiding their tablets in secret locations, enjoy a new time of peace on Mata Nui.|$|E
