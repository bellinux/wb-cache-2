25|$|The Ford Building is a steel-framed, eighteen-story office {{building}} constructed in 1907–1908 by D. H. Burnham & Company for glass manufacturers Edward Ford {{and his son}} John B. Ford. The Fords had established the Edward Ford Plate Glass Company (later merging to become Libbey–Owens–Ford) near Toledo, Ohio in 1899, after disinvesting themselves of the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company founded by Edward's father, John Baptiste Ford. The Fords constructed this building in Detroit as an <b>investment</b> <b>property</b> after unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate property purchases in Toledo.|$|E

It was not until the autumn of 1967 that Apple finally opened a London office. Since the Beatles already owned a four-story building at 94 Baker Street that had been purchased as an <b>investment</b> <b>property</b> by their accountants, they decided that Baker Street was as good a location as any for Apple. In September they set up an office for Apple Publishing in the Baker Street building. With Epstein's death, there was nobody in the Beatles' inner circle with business acumen who could manage the company, and, as with their band affairs, the Beatles decided that they would manage it themselves.|$|E

2500|$|Because of less-costly {{land and}} lower taxes, {{much of the}} growth in the {{metropolitan}} area is taking place outside of the city of Albuquerque itself. In Rio Rancho to the northwest, the communities east of the mountains, and the incorporated parts of Valencia County, population growth rates approach twice that of Albuquerque. The primary cities in Valencia County are Los Lunas and Belen, both of which are home to growing industrial complexes and new residential subdivisions. The mountain towns of Tijeras, Edgewood, and Moriarty, while close enough to Albuquerque to be considered suburbs, have experienced much less growth compared to Rio Rancho, Bernalillo, Los Lunas, and Belen. [...] Limited water supply and rugged terrain are the main limiting factors for development in these towns. The Mid Region Council of Governments (MRCOG), which includes constituents from throughout the Albuquerque area, was formed to ensure that these governments along the middle Rio Grande would be able {{to meet the needs of}} their rapidly rising populations.

40|$|Prior {{studies in}} Malaysia {{indicate}} that fair value of <b>investment</b> <b>properties</b> are not value relevant in various industries. Unlike those industries, Malaysian Real Estate Investment Trusts (MREITs) is a capital-intensive industry where the <b>investment</b> <b>properties</b> {{made up the}} majority of the MREITs total assets. Furthermore this industry is subjected to stringent monitoring by the Securities Commission (SC) which requires MREITs to adopt the fair value model and revalue their <b>investment</b> <b>properties</b> for at least once in every three years. Therefore, results from previous studies cannot be generalized to this industry. Hence, this study investigates whether fair value on <b>investment</b> <b>properties</b> is value relevant in the MREIT industry. It also examines the effect of board characteristics on the share prices of MREITs. Secondary data was obtained from annual reports of twelve listed MREITs on Bursa Malaysia from 2006 to 2011 and analyzed using multiple regression analysis. The results indicate that the information on the fair value of <b>investment</b> <b>properties</b> (as presented in balance sheet) is significantly related to share price of MREITs. However, the changes in fair value (revaluation surplus), as presented in income statement is not significantly related to the share price. The findings suggest that only fair value of <b>investment</b> <b>properties</b> (FVIP) is useful for investors to make their investment decisions. This study also found a positive and significant association between board independence and share prices of MREITs. It indicates that independence of directors in MREIT firms is also important to investors that it is reflected in the share price. This study adds to the limited literature on MREITs. The results indicate that investors do value the fair value information provided by MREITs and support the fair value accounting in REITs. The findings of this study could be used by regulators in improving the future revaluation guidelines for the REIT industry...|$|R
