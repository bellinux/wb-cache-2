25|$|The {{most direct}} evidence, {{according}} to Kahneman, is a 1973 experiment that used a psychological profile of TomW., a fictional graduate student. One group of subjects had to rate Tom's similarity to a typical student {{in each of}} nine academic areas (Law, Engineering, Library Science etc.). Another group had to rate how {{likely it is that}} Tom specialised in each area. If these ratings of likelihood are governed by probability, then they should resemble the base rates, i.e., the proportion of students in each of the nine areas (which had been separately estimated by a third group). A probabilistic judgment would say that Tom {{is more likely to be}} a Humanities student than Library Science, because many more students study Humanities, and the additional information in the profile is vague and unreliable. Instead, the ratings of likelihood matched the ratings of similarity almost perfectly, both <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> a similar one where subjects judged the likelihood of a fictional woman taking different careers. This suggests that rather than estimating probability using base rates, subjects had substituted the more accessible attribute of similarity.|$|E

50|$|Children {{less than}} five years of age had the highest {{mortality}} rate and DALYs, emphasizing the known effect of malaria on this population group. Females lost more DALYs than males in all age groups, which altered the picture displayed by the incidence rates alone. The epidemiological estimates and DALYs calculations in this study form a basis for comparing interventions that affect mortality and morbidity differently, by comparing the amount of burden averted by them. The DALYs would mark the position of malaria among the rest of the diseases, if compared to DALYs due to other diseases. Uncertainty around the estimates should be considered when using them for decision making and further work should quantify this uncertainty to facilitate utilisation of the results. More epidemiological studies are required to fill in the gaps revealed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> to more accurately determine the effect and burden of the disease.|$|E

5000|$|Along with {{influencing}} {{the structure of}} soils and ocean communities, Nitrososphaera gargensis also {{plays a role in}} food production. [...] Since nitrogen is required for food production, fertilizers containing nitrogen are used. This leads to pollution that can harm the environment and end up in wastewater. Therefore, researchers are trying to develop ways to remove the nitrogen from the affected areas. Organisms similar to Nitrososphaera gargensis were found to oxidize ammonia <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> <b>and</b> with this knowledge, the researchers plan on coupling this ability with other processes in the nitrogen cycle in order to remove the form of nitrogen that is polluting the area. Such couplings could occur {{due to the fact that}} AOA are not affected by nitrous acid concentrations whereas nitrite-oxidizing bacteria are inhibited by this chemical. In this difference, techniques could be developed to foster deammonification, which is more cost-effective. Overall, in these studies, researchers are trying to find the correct balance in a thermophilic bioreactor in order to eliminate nitrogen.|$|E
5000|$|Bacterial small RNAs (sRNA) are an {{important}} class of regulatory molecules in bacteria such as Brucella. They are often bound to the chaperone protein Hfq, which allows them to interact with mRNA(s). In Brucella suis 1330 RNA sequencing identified a novel list of 33 sRNAs and 62 Hfq-associated mRNAs. [...] In Brucella melitensis eight novel sRNA genes were identified using bioinformatic and experimental approach. One of them BSR0602 was found to modulate the intracellular survival of B. melitensis [...] In another large-scale deep sequencing study 1321 sRNAs were identified in B. melitensis. [...] BSR0441 sRNA was further investigated <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> shown to play role in the intracellular survival. sRNA BM-sr0117 from Brucella melitensis was identified and shown to be bound to and cleaved by Bm-RNase III.

50|$|One study {{concluded}} that women whose epidural infusions contained fentanyl {{were less likely to}} fully breastfeed their infant in the few days after birth and more likely to stop breastfeeding in the first 24 weeks. However, this study has been criticized for several reasons, one of which is that the original patient records were not examined <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> <b>and</b> so many of the epidural infusions were assumed to contain fentanyl when almost certainly they would not have. In addition, all those who had received epidural infusions in this study had also received systemic pethidine, which would be {{much more likely to be}} the cause of any effect on breastfeeding due to the higher amounts of medication used via that route. If this were the case, then early epidural analgesia which avoided the need for pethidine would be expected to improve breastfeeding outcomes rather than worsen them. Traditional epidural for labor relieves pain reliably only during first stage of labor (uterine contractions until cervix is fully open). It does not relieve pain as reliably during the second stage of labor (passage of the fetus through the vagina).|$|E

5000|$|In {{a direct}} {{investigation}} of Kohlberg’s necessary but not sufficient argument, Walker tested {{the hypothesis that}} only children who had attained both beginning formal operations and role taking stage 3 could progress to Kohlberg’s moral stage 3. 146 grade 4-7 children participated <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> <b>and</b> the results strongly supported the hypothesis, given that only children who had the beginning formal substage of cognitive development and role taking stage 3 progressed to moral stage 3. Further support came from the study’s demonstration that a short role playing treatment stimulated progress in moral reasoning in a 6-week follow-up retest. Krebs and Gilmore also directly tested Kohlberg’s necessary but not sufficient argument of moral development in 51 children, ages 5-14, {{for the first three}} stages of cognitive, role taking, and moral development. [...] Results generally supported Kohlberg’s view, but not as strongly, given that it was only demonstrated that cognitive development is a prerequisite for role taking development, and not for moral development. Based on these results, researchers have suggested that moral education programs underlain by Kohlberg’s theory must first ensure that the prerequisite cognitive and role taking abilities have developed.|$|E

50|$|From the {{statistics}} cited above we can deduce {{that there were}} 976 PS patients, with 91% of those involving hemorrhage. This results {{in a total of}} 888 PS patients that {{died as a result of}} hemorrhage. From these hemorrhagic cases we find that 19.2% involved junctional hemorrhage resulting in a potentially survivable subgroup of 171 patients from this study. Therefore, if a device that can control junctional hemorrhage had been available, 171 persons with life-threatening hemorrhage from junctional regions could have been treated near the point of injury most probably resulting in reduced mortality in this subgroup. And if that junctional device were multi-site capable so it could also be used to control extremity hemorrhage if needed then perhaps more in the peripheral-extremity sub-group could have survived. Additionally it is unclear to what extent that the authors of this study categorized inter-pelvic bleeding, a common component of both amputations from blast and from blunt trauma like motor vehicle accidents, as truncal hemorrhage. However it is very clear that if a device were capable of controlling not only junctional hemorrhage but was also clearly indicated and effective for controlling inter-pelvic hemorrhage, it could potentially change which injuries are viewed as “potentially survivable” <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> thereby further expand survivability.|$|E

My hope is that the insights provided here, and those drawn from feminist scholarship in the other disciplines, will help frame the parameters of future research—bridging the gender similarities/differences divide and documenting girls’ victimization, resistance, and agency in ways that capture their full humanity.” ...|$|E

5000|$|In another often-cited study, Freedman {{focused on}} the issue of MI {{prevention}} by selecting 121 patients with severe single vessel disease. 64 had Q-wave infarction and 57 did not; 32 had unstable angina or subendocardial infarction. 74 totally occluded vessels and 47 subtotally occluded vessels were identified <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> <b>and</b> the presence of total occlusion was the most significant predictor of the existence of collaterals. 63 of 74 (85%) of the [...] "totalled" [...] vessels were accompanied by evidence of collaterals, compared to 8 of 47 (17%) of the subtotalled vessels (p=0.001). Collaterals were completely absent beside arteries with less than 90% stenosis. Totally occluded arteries were found in 29 of 57 patients in the group without Q-wave myocardial infarctions, and all 29 showed collaterals. In comparison, 76% of those who lacked totally occluded arteries showed collaterals (p is less than 0.005). In contrast, all 24 of those 57 patients without Q-wave MI's who did not have collaterals had subtotal stenosis of their diseased vessel. Though smoking, cholesterol levels, and the presence of angina did not differ between the groups, the presence of subendocardial infarction was significantly greater in those with collaterals, suggesting either that subendocardial infarction precipitates the formation of collaterals to an extent comparable to Q-wave infarcts, or that preexisting collaterals prevent subendocardial infarctions from becoming transmural infarctions.|$|E
5000|$|The 2000 work, The Ecclesiastical Organisation of the Church of the East, 1318-1913, {{offers an}} {{explanation}} {{in the first}} chapter: The terminology {{used in this study}} deserves a word of explanation. Until recently the Church of the East was usually called the [...] "Nestorian" [...] church, and East Syrian Christians were either [...] "Nestorians" [...] or (after the schism of 1552) by the ethnic and geographic misnomer [...] "Chaldeans". During the period covered in this study, the word [...] "Nestorian" [...] was used both as a term of abuse by those who disapproved of the traditional East Syrian theology, as a term of pride by many of its defenders (including Abdisho of Nisibis in 1318, the patriarch Eliya X Yohannan Marogin in 1672, and the patriarch Shimun XVII Abraham in 1842), and as a neutral and convenient descriptive term by others. Nowadays it is generally felt that the term carries a stigma, and students of the Church of the East are advised to avoid its use. In this thesis the theologically neutral adjective [...] "East Syrian" [...] has been used wherever possible, and the term [...] "traditionalist" [...] to distinguish the non-Catholic branch of the Church of the East after the schism of 1552. The modern term [...] "Assyrian", often used in the same sense, was unknown for most of the period covered <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> <b>and</b> has been avoided.|$|E
5000|$|Bayton’s {{research}} interests were widespread. He furthered psychological research {{in areas of}} personality, race, social issues, and consumer psychology. His research was generally of an applied nature, and thus, his efforts helped increase the scope and depth of applied {{work in the field}} of psychology. [...] In particular, several studies conducted by Bayton foreshadowed the emergence of system-justification theory, which addresses the tendency to support the status-quo or the “system,” even when the “system” may not be beneficial to an individual or group. In particular, the idea of out-group favoritism (a subset of system-justification theory), or viewing a high-status group positively and one’s own low-status group more negatively, emerges in Bayton’s research. [...] In his study, “Negro perception of Negro and white personality traits,” he found that Black participants perceived Whites as having more positive temperaments than Blacks. He theorized that this bias resulted from a tendency to “idealize the aggressor” and “incorporate his negative views” into participants’ views of their minority group. [...] In other words, out-group favoritism emerged <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> <b>and</b> the participants appeared to support a racial hierarchy, or “system,” that was not beneficial to these subjects. Additionally, in another of Bayton’s studies, “Evaluative Race-Class Stereotypes by Race and Perceived Class of Subjects,” subjects assigned more advantageous traits to the middle as opposed to the lower class regardless of their own class. This study also illustrates a tendency for people to justify the [...] "system", or in other words, support the American ideal of a social meritocracy whether or not this [...] "system" [...] is truly just or beneficial to them.|$|E
