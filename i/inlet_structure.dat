40|$|The {{frequency}} of on-site systems {{for treatment of}} domestic wastewater is increasing with new residential development in both rural and low-density suburban areas. Subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SFCW) have emerged as a viable option to achieve advanced or secondary treatment of domestic wastewater. The pollutant removal efficiency in SFCW depends on design parameters. Many of these factors have been investigated while others such as aspect ratio, design of water <b>inlet</b> <b>structure</b> and method of dosing the wetland {{have yet to be}} fully examined. This study examined the effect of aspect ratio and header design on BOD 5 removal efficiency as well as the impact of flow rate on flow distribution in a SFCW. An aspect ratio of 4 : 1 achieved 10 % greater removal of organic matter than a 1 : 1 ratio. Tracer studies demonstrated that wetlands loaded at a constant rate of 3. 8 L/min and 7. 6 L/min experienced preferential flow. In addition, tracer studies showed wetlands with leaching chambers as headers failed to achieve equal flow distribution. An improvement in effluent water quality was achieved by replacing the leaching chamber for a perforated manifold as the <b>inlet</b> <b>structure.</b> This study demonstrated the importance of the careful selection of aspect ratio and means by which water is introduced to the wetland in the design of SFCW...|$|E

Unfortunately, the prospect of utilizing lighweight, high strength composites for <b>inlet</b> <b>structures</b> of jet engines has been frustrated by the low transverse thermal conductivity of such materials. It was the objective of this program to develop an advanced materials and design concept for anti-icing composite structures. The concept that was evaluated used capillary glass tubes embedded on the surface of a composite structure with heated air ducted through the tubes. An analytical computer program was developed to predict the anti-icing performance of such tubes and a test program was conducted to demonstrate actual performance of this system.

Age- 0 sturgeon were capable of accessing most chutes; however, accessibility appeared limited at sites with highly restrictive <b>inlet</b> <b>structures.</b> Our results suggest that future consideration of chute inlet designs that meet authorized Missouri River purposes while providing improved fish access is warranted. Additionally, capture sites for exogenously feeding age- 0 sturgeon were usually deeper (3 ̆e 1. 5 m) and faster (3 ̆e 0. 5 m/s) than sites without sturgeon in chute and adjacent main-stem habitats.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{morphing}} {{air inlet}} is a structure with shape-changing capability. Shapes include {{that which is}} flush with an aerodynamic surface and also a submerged divergent channel suitable for use in an aircraft cooling system. The air <b>inlet</b> <b>structure</b> is multistable in order that it can ‘snap ’ open and closed and not require any external holding force to maintain its geometry. Structural multistability is achieved using a novel combination of material prestress and bending stiffness tailoring. Analytical and finite element models are developed in order to explain how this multistability is achieved and to predict the actuator requirements and bending strains within the structure. The air inlet design is autoclave man-ufactured from carbon fiber reinforced plastic and tested as a proof-of-concept demonstrator. The bending stiffness tailoring enables the structure to fulfill the conflicting requirements of large deformations, low mass, and high stiffness to withstand external loads. The simple construction also aids ease of maintenance and reliability. The morphing demonstrator behaves as a one degree-of-freedom system enabling simple actuation solutions, such as inflat-able bladders, to be feasible...|$|E

Little {{information regarding the}} inlet mechanical design {{is available in the}} preliminary design phase, so it is necessary to first develop a reasonable structural design before estimating the inlet weight. The Internally Pressurized Structure Synthesis and Optimization (IPSSO) program, employing an analytical approach, was chosen for evaluation due to its combined design and analysis capabilities. The inlet design produced by IPSSO was then analyzed using the NASTRAN finite element program. The finite element analysis was performed to help identify the limitations of the analytically based code as well as to evaluate NASTRAN for this application. Comparison between the IPSSO inlet weight and that of a similar inlet developed by the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group was also made.

The flow angles can’t be directly considered as the blade profile’s structure angles, so it is necessary to modify the calculated flow angles to obtain structure angles. Through the analysis, in order to improve the performance of the turbodrill, the flow angles should be modified to get the structure angles toward reducing direction. In this paper, the hydraulic efficiency and circumferential force fx are selected as evaluation parameters, cascade CFD models are built and calculated with the different modified angles. What’s more, the modified inlet and outlet flow angle impact on the turbine performance has been analysed, the given angle modification range is greatly narrowed in existing literature, which allow the designers determine modified value easily in the angle modification process...|$|E

In this study, two dimensional (2 -D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were compared to experimental residence time distributions (RTD) from literature. In one of the-three geometries simulated, the 2 -D CFD model successfully predicted the experimental RTD. However, flow patterns {{in the other two}} geometries were not well described due to the difficulty of representing the three dimensional (3 -D) experimental inlet in the 2 -D CFD model, and the sensitivity of the model results to the assumptions used to characterise the inlet. Neither a velocity similarity nor geometric similarity approach to inlet representation in 2 -D gave results correlating with experimental data. However. it was shown that 2 -D CFD models were not affected by changes in values of model parameters which are difficult to predict, particularly the turbulent inlet conditions. This work suggests that 2 -D CFD models cannot be used a priori to give an adequate description of the hydrodynamic patterns in WSP. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Partial rehabilitation consisted of the same improvements {{with the exception of the}} re-use system. The mean water use per watering of 0. 61 Â± 0. 08 Ml/ha for the fully rehabilitated farm was approximately one third of that for non-rehabilitated farms (1. 89 Â± 0. 15 Ml/ha) and two thirds of that for partially rehabilitated farms (0. 99 Â± 0. 07 Ml/ha). These differences were statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. A large improvement in efficiency of water use was achieved by upgraded water delivery infrastructure and laser levelling of paddocks. Considerable improvement in water use efficiency was also gained, however, only by installation of re-use systems.

The radial position increase of the knot closer to the leading edge gives an overall increase of the pressure recovery level for both flight conditions. The radial position change of the knot close to the throat diameter leads to the global maximum of the absolute total pressure recovery almost independent of the axial position change of the same knot, for both flight conditions.

Compressed air flow is controlled by a PLC/solenoid valve system that acts to pulse air introductions at high frequency so as to actively herd fish toward upstream water <b>inlet</b> <b>structures.</b> ADP allows for control of progression (sweep) speed, direction, energy level and frequency of repeat sweeps. Tests of ADP were conducted using actively migrating wild adult Connecticut River American shad (Alosa sapidissima) collected mid-May through early June 2014 (N= 408). Collected fish were measured for length, sexed, and tagged externally with 23 mm half-duplex PIT tags and held overnight. Trials were performed in a laboratory flume measuring 3 m X 18 m that received Connecticut River water {{at a rate of}} 368 l/s which provided a working depth of 137 cm. Water entered the flume via a contracted rectangular weir 91 cm in width with a delta H of 35. 6 cm. The flume bulkhead supporting the weir incorporated aprons and a ramped floor to streamline flow. The floor of the flume incorporated 14 recessed rows of diffusers positioned at 1. 2 m centers along its longitudinal axis. Each row relied on 17 diffusers for air release.
