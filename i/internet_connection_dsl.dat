50|$|A videoconference, or videoteleconference (VTC), {{is a set}} of {{telecommunication}} technologies allowing two or more {{locations to}} interact via two-way video and audio transmissions simultaneously. There are basically two types of videoconferencing; dedicated VTC systems have all required components packaged into a single piece of equipment while desktop VTC systems are add-ons to normal PC's, transforming them into VTC devices. Simultaneous videoconferencing among three or more remote points is possible by means of a Multipoint Control Unit (MCU). There are MCU bridges for IP and ISDN-based videoconferencing. Due to the price point and proliferation of the Internet, and broadband in particular, there has been a strong spurt of growth and use of H.323-based IP videoconferencing. H.323 is accessible to anyone with a high speed <b>Internet</b> <b>connection,</b> such as <b>DSL.</b> Videoconferencing is utilized in various situations, for example; distance education, telemedicine, Video Relay Service, and business.|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} of smartphone ability is rapidly increasing the power consumption. Many {{methods have been}} proposed to reduce smartphone power consumption. Most of these methods use the <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> control based {{on the availability of}} the battery power level regardless of when and where a waste of energy occurs. This paper proposes a new approach to control the <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> based on idle time using user behavior pattern analysis. User behavior patterns are used to predict idle time duration. <b>Internet</b> <b>connection</b> control performed during idle time. During idle time <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> periodically switched on and off by a certain time interval. This method effectively reduces a waste of energy. Control of the <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> does not interfere the user because it is implemented on idle time.
