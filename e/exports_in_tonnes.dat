25|$|The {{company was}} hit by the Great Depression as ore prices fell in 1930. Production was reduced by {{reducing}} the work to a four-day week, which continued for seven months. Although ore prices varied, the company had made a profit throughout the 1930s. Knudtzen retired as chief of operations in 1935 {{and was replaced by}} Hans Torgersrud. The following year Sydvaranger bought forty percent of the shipping company Malmfart, which signed a ten-year contract to ship ore. The company's first ship was the 1919 SS Varangmalm. Malmfart later bought SS Varangberg, and both ships were sunk in 1939. Work with establishing mining at Grunntjern and Søstervann started in 1937. From 1938 mining started at Kjellmannsåsen, where there sufficient concentration to allow it to be direct shipping ore. This was the first time trucks were used for transport. The company <b>exported</b> 900,000 <b>tonnes</b> <b>in</b> 1938. From 1939 production was more difficult and was periodically stopped. However, an agreement was signed on 11 July 1939 to establish Harefossen Kraftselskap which would build a power station at Harefossen in Passvikelva.|$|R
50|$|The {{centre of}} {{ecological}} diversity for durians is {{the island of}} Borneo, where {{the fruit of the}} edible species of Durio including D. zibethinus, D. dulcis, D. graveolens, D. kutejensis, D. oxleyanus and D. testudinarum is sold in local markets. In Brunei, D. zibethinus is not grown because consumers prefer other species such as D. graveolens, D. kutejensis and D. oxleyanus. These species are commonly distributed in Brunei, and together with other species like D. testudinarum and D. dulcis, represent rich genetic diversity.Although the durian is not native to Thailand, the country is currently one of the major exporters of durians, growing 781,000 tonnes of the world's total harvest of 1,400,000 <b>tonnes</b> <b>in</b> 1999, 111,000 <b>tonnes</b> of which it exported to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Canada.
