Because a significant portion of his income is derived from selling his original artwork, he is reluctant to learn how to produce his work digitally.|$|E

500|$|... {{the latest}} update was version 0.43.05, with it {{completing}} 14 years in development despite being an alpha version. Adams {{and his brother}} have a to-do list of features the game should have before version 1.0 and the version number is the percentage progress of its completion. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been able to maintain focus by shifting his attention to {{different aspects of the}} game, given its large coverage. While regular game development aim to perfect their work for release, he considers that a drawback since he continues exploring and learning while adding new features. Wired and Rock, Paper, Shotgun called some of its bug fixes unintentional and funny, with PC Gamer saying it makes an entertaining RSS feed to subscribe to. Adams has two favorite bugs. One is about a farmer dwarf planting his own bed. The other involves a dwarven executioner, with broken arms unable to use his hammer, delivering punishments by biting his victims and tearing off their limbs, keeping one in his mouth for years.|$|E
