5|$|During the Song dynasty {{there was}} also great amount of {{attention}} given to the building of efficient automotive vessels known as paddle wheel craft. The latter had been known in China perhaps since the 5th century, and certainly by the Tang dynasty in 784 with the successful paddle wheel warship design of Li Gao. In 1134 the Deputy Transport Commissioner of Zhejiang, Wu Ge, had paddle wheel warships constructed {{with a total of}} nine wheels and others with thirteen wheels. However, there were paddle wheel ships in the Song that were so large that 12 wheels were featured {{on each side of the}} vessel. In 1135 the famous general Yue Fei (1103–1142) ambushed a force of rebels under Yang Yao, entangling their paddle wheel craft by filling a lake with <b>floating</b> <b>weeds</b> and rotting logs, thus allowing them to board their ships and gain a strategic victory. In 1161, gunpowder bombs and paddle wheel crafts were used effectively by the Song Chinese at the Battle of Tangdao and the Battle of Caishi along the Yangtze River against the Jurchen Jin dynasty during the Jin–Song Wars. The Jurchen invasion, led by Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing), failed to conquer the Southern Song. In 1183 the Nanjing naval commander Chen Tang was given a reward for constructing ninety paddle wheel craft and other warships. In 1176, Emperor Xiaozong of Song (r. 1162–1189) issued an imperial order to the Nanjing official Guo Gang (who desired to convert damaged paddle wheel craft into junk ships and galleys) not to limit the number of paddle wheel craft in the navy's dockyards, since he had high esteem for the fast assault craft that won the Chinese victory at Caishi. However, paddle wheel craft found other uses besides effective assaults in warfare. The Arab or Persian Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for Quanzhou, the Muslim Pu Shougeng (who served from 1250 to 1275) noted that paddle wheel ships were also used by the Chinese as tugboats for towing.|$|E
500|$|Rusalkas are the Slavic {{counterpart}} of the Greek sirens and naiads. [...] The nature of rusalkas varies among folk traditions, {{but according to}} ethnologist D.K. Zelenin they all share a common element: they are the restless spirits of the unclean dead. [...] They are usually the ghosts of young women who died a violent or untimely death, perhaps by murder or suicide, before their wedding and especially by drowning. Rusalkas are said to inhabit lakes and rivers. [...] They appear as beautiful young women with long pale green hair and pale skin, suggesting a connection with <b>floating</b> <b>weeds</b> and days spent underwater in faint sunlight. They can be seen after dark, dancing together under the moon and calling out to young men by name, luring them to the water and drowning them. The characterization of rusalkas as both desirable and treacherous is prevalent in southern Russia, the Ukraine and Belarus, and was emphasized by 19th-century Russian authors. The best-known of the great Czech nationalist composer Antonín Dvořák's operas is Rusalka.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The harpacticoid copepod Parathalestris croni, a {{widespread}} pelagic {{species of the}} northern North Atlantic, {{was found to be}} closely associated with seaweed originating in the intertidal zone float-ing {{on the surface of the}} sea around Iceland. The abundance of the copepod increased with distance from the shore and it showed a special affinity for the brown alga Ascophyllum nodosum. The cope-pods in the macroalgal clumps were mostly ovigerous females, and the seaweed clearly serves a nest function. The eggs were deposited on the seaweed where the nauplii, which are unable to swim, crawl on the algae until they metamorphose into the first copepodite stage (CI). The CI copepodites leave the <b>floating</b> <b>weed,</b> and the juvenile stages may eventually disperse widely in the water column until <b>floating</b> <b>weed</b> is colonized, probably by adults or juveniles in the last one or two copepodite stages. Parathalestris croni is one of a group of very few species known or suspected to be dependent for sur-vival on the extremely unpredictable habitat of <b>floating</b> <b>weed</b> in the northern North Atlantic...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} explore {{effective}} methods for weed control in paddy fields, we investigated {{the dynamics of}} weed seeds in Nanjing from June to November of 2005. A total of 24 weed species representing 15 families were found before seedling transplanting and at late growth stage of rice, while during irrigation stage, 26 species of 17 families were identified from <b>floating</b> <b>weed</b> seeds. The two stages shared 18 weed species, accounting for 56. 25 % of the total weeds. Most of them belonged to Gramineae, Polygonaceae, Ranunculaceae, Primulaceae, Cyperaceae, Compositae, and Pontederiaceae. There were more weed seeds and more species floating at the edge than {{in the middle of}} the paddy field. Some <b>weed</b> seeds could <b>float</b> longer, such as Beckmannia syzigachne, Lysimachia candida, Ranunculus chinensis, Rumex dentatus, Cnidium monnieri, and Alopecurus aequalis. Many <b>floating</b> <b>weed</b> seeds aggregated around rice stubble. In general, seeds began to sink abruptly after floating for two days, and most of them fell to the bottom after eight days. It is obvious that weeds in paddy fields can disperse through floating. Therefore, to filtrate water or clean <b>floating</b> <b>weed</b> seeds can help to reduce the seed weed amount so as to control weeds in paddy fields...|$|R
2500|$|In the {{following}} three years, Ozu accomplished the (in the opinion of one scholar) “astonishing” feat of winning, {{three times in a}} row, the “Best Film” award in Kinema Junpo magazine's [...] "Best Ten" [...] critics’ prize, the most prestigious of Japanese film awards at that time. These three films were I Was Born, But... (Umarete wa Mita Keredo, 1932), Passing Fancy (Dekigokoro, 1933) and A Story of <b>Floating</b> <b>Weeds</b> (Ukigusa Monogatari, 1934), respectively. Other films Ozu directed during the 1930s also won prizes in these annual awards. One critic, Hideo Tsumura, wrote in 1938 that Japan had produced thus far only two great filmmakers: Ozu and his close friend Sadao Yamanaka. Since Yamanaka made films exclusively of the jidaigeki type, Tsumura's statement would seem to indicate that, to this critic and perhaps to others, Ozu had become the preeminent shomingeki director.|$|E

60|$|The {{normal course}} of events where new land rises above the sea is {{something}} like this, as oceanic isles have sufficiently demonstrated. The rock when it first emerges from the water rises bare and rugged like a sea-cliff; no living thing, animal or vegetable, is harboured anywhere on its naked surface. In time, however, as rain falls upon its jutting peaks and barren pinnacles, disintegration sets in, or, to speak plainer English, the rock crumbles; and soon streams wash down tiny deposits of sand and mud thus produced into the valleys and hollows of the upheaved area. At the same time lichens begin to spring in yellow patches upon the bare face of the rock, and feathery ferns, whose spores have been wafted by the wind, or carried by the waves, or borne on the feet of unconscious birds, sprout here and there from the clefts and crannies. These, as they die and decay, in turn form {{a thin layer of}} vegetable mould, the first beginning of a local soil, in which the trusty earthworm (imported in the egg on driftwood or <b>floating</b> <b>weeds)</b> straightway sets to work to burrow, and which he rapidly increases by his constant labour. On the soil thus deposited, flowering plants and trees can soon root themselves, as fast as seeds, nuts or fruits are wafted to the island by various accidents from surrounding countries. The new land thrown up by the great eruption of Krakatoa has in this way already clothed itself from head to foot with a luxuriant sheet of ferns, mosses, and other vegetation.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile, it must {{be remembered}} that this gulf-weed has not, as some of the uninitiated fancy from its name, {{anything}} to do with the Gulf Stream, along the southern edge of which we were steaming.

One glance at a bit of the weed, as it floats past, showed that it is like no Fucus of our shores, or anything we ever saw before. The difference of look is undefinable in words, but clear enough. One sees in a moment that the Sargassos, of which there are several species on Tropical shores, are a genus of themselves and by themselves; and a certain awe may, if the beholder be at once scientific and poetical, come over him at the first sight of this famous and unique variety thereof, which has lost ages since the habit of growing on rock or sea-bottom, but propagates itself for ever floating; and feeds among its branches a whole family of fish, crabs, cuttlefish, zoophytes, mollusks, which, like the plant which shelters them, are found nowhere else in the world. And that awe, springing from 'the scientific use of the imagination,' would be increased if he recollected the theory--not altogether impossible--that this sargasso (and possibly some of the animals which cling to it) marks the site of an Atlantic continent, sunk long ages since; and that, transformed by the necessities of life from a rooting to a floating plant, ...|$|E

40|$|Hydrological changes {{associated}} with irrigation, {{in conjunction with}} increased nutrient concentrations and aquatic plant densities, have greatly impacted fish habitat values on the Burdekin River floodplain. The two most significant weeds in the Burdekin floodplain are water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and para grass (Urochloa mutica). Water hyacinth creates a base for the para grass (and then other weeds) to grow out into deeper water, creating weed mats that can then only be removed by mechanical means or floods of the largest magnitude. We attempted to rehabilitate floodplain lagoons by the mechanical removal of <b>floating</b> <b>weed</b> mats and monitored the result by measuring the subsequent effects on fish habitats and fish communities. Prior to weed removal, fish habitats were generally of poor quality, and fish community structure was skewed away from rich native assemblages to depauperate communities dominated in some instances by alien species. Poor water quality arising from <b>floating</b> <b>weed</b> mats {{is considered to be}} the main determinant of reduced fish abundance and diversity. After mechanical weed removal, recovery of water quality and physical habitat led to the re-establishment of many native fish species. Key refuge habitats within the distribution channels were a critical source of recruits for fishes dispersing during times of elevated seasonal flows into the newly rehabilitated reaches. This study demonstrates that <b>floating</b> alien <b>weed</b> mats have significant negative effects upon aquatic communities and that mechanical removal of these weed mats (as opposed to chemical removal) results in dramatic improvements in native fish species richness and abundance.
