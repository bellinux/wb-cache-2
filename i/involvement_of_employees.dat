However, during the process of innovation, the unique characteristic of family firms that consisted of family and non-family employees need to be taken into consideration. Different perspectives and objectives from these two different employees could lead to complexity during such innovation process. This study looked at how far are the <b>involvements</b> <b>of</b> non-family <b>employees</b> during product innovation in a family firm called Zara Foodstuff Industries Sdn. Bhd. The findings from this case study suggests few factors that need to be taken into consideration by family firms such as the relationship between family and non-family employees and the centralized decision-making process. Such characteristics were seen as those that could prohibit the <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> non-family <b>employees</b> during such innovation process. At the same time, there is also a linkage of cultural factor such as the high power distance that could inhibit such involvement.

5000|$|Packages {{may also}} vary if the {{employee}} is laid off, or voluntarily quits {{in the face}} of a layoff (VRIF). The method of separation may have an effect on a former employee's ability to collect whatever form of unemployment compensation might be available in their jurisdiction. In many U.S. states, workers who are laid off can file an unemployment claim and receive compensation. Depending on local or state laws, workers who leave voluntarily are generally ineligible to collect unemployment benefits, as are those who are fired for gross misconduct. Also, lay-offs due to a firm's moving production overseas may entitle one to increased re-training benefits. Some companies in the United States utilize Supplemental Unemployment Benefits. Since they were first introduced by organized labor and the Department of Labor in the early 1950s, and first issued in a Revenue Ruling by the IRS in 1956, [...] SUB-Pay Plans have enabled employers to supplement the receipt of state unemployment insurance benefits for employees that experience an involuntary layoff. By establishing severance payments as SUB-Pay benefits, the payments are not considered wages for FICA, FUTA, and SUI tax purposes, and employee FICA tax. To qualify for SUB-Pay benefits, the participant must be eligible for state unemployment insurance benefits and the separation benefit must be paid on a periodic basis. There have also been increasing concerns about the organizational effectiveness of the post-downsized ‘anorexic organization’. The benefits, which organizations claim to be seeking from downsizing, center on savings in labor costs, speedier decision making, better communication, reduced product development time, enhanced <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> and greater responsiveness to customers (De Meuse et al. 1997, p. 168). However, some writers draw attention to the ‘obsessive’ pursuit of downsizing to the point of self-starvation marked by excessive cost cutting, organ failure and an extreme pathological fear of becoming inefficient. Hence ‘trimming’ and ‘tightening belts’ are the order of the day.|$|E

The benefits associated with the holistic <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> {{for the duration of}} quality projects is an often debated issue. In light of this, deriving the true benefit (if any), of unreservedly involving employees in quality initiatives becomes an interesting proposition that may provide new information from a local perspective. Review of the associated literature provided the study with the grounding of several theories that provide a consensus for employee involvement in quality as a necessity for business excellence. However, employee involvement in quality is still not prevalent in many local companies. Two separate locally based multinational firms were selected as participants in this study so as to gain a better perspective and understanding of the current status of employee involvement in quality efforts. The results of the investigation indicate a positive interrelation between the <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> in quality projects and the subsequent success of these projects.

40|$|This {{academic}} {{essay is}} built on a qualitative study about middle managers experience of the communication and the <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> {{in the process of}} change. Nine middle managers within Swedish primary care have been interviewed with the purpose of researching different middle managers different and similar views on the communication in the process of change. In the essay, our collected empiricism is set against theories like Kurt Lewin's (1951) model of change and the model of communication created by Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver (1963). A mutual view on the communication that emerged in our research was that the early <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> in the process of change is highly substantial. This has been done in different ways and with partially different outcomes, which appears in our research. The employees participated in an early stage so that they could get {{a better understanding of the}} change and be a part of it and affect the outcome. We also learned that several middle managers saw the informal information as crucial in the process of change. Seven out of the nine respondents tried their ideas of change with employees during coffee breaks or in the corridors in an informal way to get their crew onboard on the change early in the process. The ones who went about the informal way were successful to a greater extent to get their employees to participate in the change. ...|$|E
