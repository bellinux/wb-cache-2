The fluorine content {{of the most common}} grades varies between 66 and 70%.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hexafluoropropylene</b> oxide (HFPO) is an {{intermediate}} used in industrial organofluorine chemistry; specifically it is a monomer for fluoropolymers. This colourless gas is the epoxide of <b>hexafluoropropylene,</b> that is fluorinated analog of propylene oxide, HFPO {{is produced by}} DuPont and 3M and as a precursor to the lubricant Krytox and related materials. It is generated by oxidation of perfluoropropylene, e.g. with oxygen {{as well as other}} oxidants.|$|E

50|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, {{approximately}} 95 percent of chloropropanes {{were being used}} as chemical intermediates. Chemical intermediates are industrial chemicals that are used {{as the starting point}} to produce other chemicals. 1,2,3-TCP is currently used as an intermediate in the production of polysulfone liquid polymers, the synthesis of <b>hexafluoropropylene,</b> and as a cross-linking agent in the synthesis of polysulfides. Polysulfone liquid polymers are used in the following industries: aerospace, automotive, consumer goods, electrical and electronic, health care, and in industrial equipment, such as compressor and pump valve components. <b>Hexafluoropropylene</b> is a fluorointermediate that is a key building block required to produce Teflon fluoropolymers; it has applications in the agrochemical, electronics, dyes/pigments, pharmaceutical, and specialty polymermarkets. Polysulfides are used as catalyst sulfidation agents and in the formulation of lubricant additives created for use in high-pressure environments or applications.|$|E
50|$|Acyclic perfluoroethers are known, e.g. O(C2F5)2, the {{analogue}} of diethylether. More {{interesting and}} more useful are the cyclic ethers, especially, the epoxides. Thus tetrafluoroethyene oxide and <b>hexafluoropropylene</b> oxide {{are two of}} the simplest cyclic perfluoroethers. It is a precursor to perfluoro(methyl vinyl ether) (CF2=CFOCF3) and perfluoro(propyl vinyl ether) are used as a comonomers with tetrafluoroethylene.|$|E
50|$|Fluorinated {{ethylene}} propylene or FEP is a copolymer of <b>hexafluoropropylene</b> and tetrafluoroethylene. It {{differs from}} the PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) resins {{in that it is}} melt-processable using conventional injection molding and screw extrusion techniques. Fluorinated ethylene propylene was invented by DuPont and is sold under the brandname Teflon FEP. Other brandnames are Neoflon FEP from Daikin or Dyneon FEP from Dyneon/3M.|$|E
50|$|FEP is {{produced}} by free-radical polymerization of mixtures of tetrafluoroethylene and <b>hexafluoropropylene.</b> The mixture is biased {{to compensate for the}} relatively low reactivity of the propylene component. The process is typically initiated with peroxydisulfate, which homolyzes to generate sulfate radicals. Because FEP is poorly soluble in almost all solvents, the polymerization is conducted as an emulsion in water, often using a surfactant such as PFOS. The polymer contains about 5% of the propylene component.|$|E
50|$|Fluoro{{elastomers}}, {{like other}} elastomers (artificial rubbers), consist of disordered polymer chains connected in three dimensions. The main challenges in making fluorelastomers are cross-linking (reacting the unreactive polymers), {{as well as}} removing the HF formed during curing. There are three main families of fluoroelasters. VDF/HFP is a copolymer system of vinylidene fluoride and (at least 20%) <b>hexafluoropropylene.</b> TFE/propylene is another copylymer system with better chemical resistance to some solvents. TFE/PMVE (perfluoromethylvinyl ether) is a copolymer system which creates a perfluorinated fluoroelastomer.|$|E
50|$|Perfluoroalkoxy alkanes or PFA are fluoropolymers. They are {{copolymers}} of tetrafluoroethylene (C2F4) and perfluoroethers (C2F3ORf, where Rf is a perfluorinated group such as trifluoromethyl (CF3)). In {{terms of}} their properties, these polymers are similar to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The big {{difference is that the}} alkoxy substituents allow the polymer to be melt-processed. On a molecular level, PFA has a smaller chain length, and higher chain entanglement than other fluoropolymers. It also contains an oxygen atom at the branches. This results in a material that is more translucent and has improved flow, creep resistance, and thermal stability close to or exceeding PTFE. Similarly advantaged processing properties are found in fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), the copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and <b>hexafluoropropylene.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fires {{with high}} {{availability}} of oxygen burn {{at a high}} temperature and with small amount of smoke produced; the particles are mostly composed of ash, or with large temperature differences, of condensed aerosol of water. High temperature also leads to production of nitrogen oxides. Sulfur content yields sulfur dioxide, or in case of incomplete combustion, hydrogen sulfide. Carbon and hydrogen are almost completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water. Fires burning with lack of oxygen produce a significantly wider palette of compounds, many of them toxic. Partial oxidation of carbon produces carbon monoxide, nitrogen-containing materials can yield hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, and nitrogen oxides. Hydrogen gas can be produced instead of water. Content of halogens such as chlorine (e.g. in polyvinyl chloride or brominated flame retardants) may lead to production of e.g. hydrogen chloride, phosgene, dioxin, and chloromethane, bromomethane and other halocarbons. Hydrogen fluoride can be formed from fluorocarbons, whether fluoropolymers subjected to fire or halocarbon fire suppression agents. Phosphorus and antimony oxides and their reaction products can be formed from some fire retardant additives, increasing smoke toxicity and corrosivity. Pyrolysis of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), e.g. from burning older transformer oil, and to lower degree also of other chlorine-containing materials, can produce 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, a potent carcinogen, and other polychlorinated dibenzodioxins. Pyrolysis of fluoropolymers, e.g. teflon, in presence of oxygen yields carbonyl fluoride (which hydrolyzes readily to HF and CO2); other compounds may be formed as well, e.g. carbon tetrafluoride, <b>hexafluoropropylene,</b> and highly toxic perfluoroisobutene (PFIB).|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{relates the}} results of the preliminary investigation into the catalytic interaction of PTFE with various inorganic materials, with the primary goal of find catalysts that will greatly increase the yield of the high value pyrolysis products, most notably <b>hexafluoropropylene</b> and octafluorocyclobutane. This dissertation is divided into three parts, viz. : A review on the literature concerning PTFE pyrolysis; a brief description of facilities built for this research; and {{the results of}} the experimental work. The experimental work was conducted with a hyphenated TGA-FTIR system in which samples of commercial PTFE mixed with catalyst were pyrolysed. Some sulfates, fluorides and common oxides of the fourth period- and group 13 metals were used as catalysts. It was found that the fluorides of the fourth period metals Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Fe and Mn are generally inert with respect to reformation of the gas phase. The sulfates of these metals produced mixed results with NiSO 4 increasing the yield of <b>hexafluoropropylene</b> whilst CuSO 4 and CoSO 4 produced unidentified side products and the rest being inert. The oxides also produced mixed results with CuO readily oxidising PTFE to CO 2. Among the group 13 metals, the fluoride, sulphate, and common oxide of aluminium gave the best results, converting the PTFE pyrolysates almost completely to <b>hexafluoropropylene</b> and hexafluoroethane. Reaction mechanisms for the conversion of the pyrolysates on Al 2 O 3 are proposed. No impact was noticed on the yield of octafluorocyclobutane or the yield of the octafluorobutene isomers. Research recommendations include: Metal oxides examined here should be tested further by examination of the metals in their 3 + and 2 + oxidation states, where the applicable oxide has not been covered; the phosphates of the metals examined here should also be studied to determine if the presence of a phosphorous atom will affect the reactivity; and ab initio work should be conducted to gain insight as to which crystal surfaces are responsible for the catalytic effects of the relevant materials. The work detailed here was limited to a qualitative investigation of the PTFE/catalyst system and does not include deep theoretical treatment of such topics as pyrolysate mass transfer and catalyst surface conditions.
