5|$|In {{the centre}} of the town lies Weymouth Harbour; {{although}} it was the reason for the town's foundation, the harbour separates the two areas of Melcombe Regis (the main town centre) and Weymouth (the southern harbourside) from <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> <b>Since</b> the 18th century they have been linked by successive bridges over the narrowest part of the harbour.

Over time Alvo's behaviour becomes increasingly erratic, and he is later killed by {{a man in a}} Tony Blair mask for taking a drug boat the group used earlier. The four clean the boat to remove evidence of their presence, when they are mistaken for drug dealers and paid three million euros.
