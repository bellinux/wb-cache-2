500|$|Specimen AMNH NJ-90Z {{is a small}} {{wedge-shaped}} {{fragment of}} pileus which was accidentally fractured during preparation for study, splitting it in half. Though the researchers had not intended to perform destructive analysis on the sample, this fracturing warranted the sacrifice of {{some parts of the}} specimen for structural and molecular study. [...] Small pieces of the specimen were mounted directly on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) stubs and sputter coated with a gold/palladium alloy. [...] The resulting images showed that little intact tissue remained, and only fragmented and crushed basidiospores were seen. [...] Another sample of the specimen was mounted in spurr's resin (an embedding medium used in electron microscopy) and sectioned with a diamond knife; the resulting sections were examined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). [...] The lack of discernible biological material from the mushroom seen in the SEM study was confirmed in the TEM analysis. [...] A final section of the fossil was selected to attempt DNA sequencing. [...] A small sample of the fossil was extracted at the AMNH and sent to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology for DNA amplification. [...] None of the three selected extracts showed any results after the amplification was attempted. [...] It is possible that the fractures and <b>flowlines</b> which split AMNH NJ-90Z during initial preparation had already penetrated into the fossil and destroyed the hermetic seal which would have been needed for preserving the organic matter of the mushroom.|$|E
2500|$|As glaciers {{move over}} their beds, they entrain and move {{material}} of all sizes. Glaciers can carry the largest sediment, {{and areas of}} glacial deposition often contain {{a large number of}} glacial erratics, many of which are several metres in diameter.

Sediment entrained in glaciers often moves approximately along the glacial <b>flowlines,</b> causing it to appear at the surface in the ablation zone.|$|E

40|$|We apply a novel {{one-dimensional}} glacier hydrology {{model that}} calculates hydraulic {{head to the}} tidewater-terminating Sermeq Avannarleq <b>flowline</b> of the Greenland ice sheet. Within a plausible parameter space, the model achieves a quasi-steady-state annual cycle in which hydraulic head oscillates close to flotation throughout the ablation zone. Flotation is briefly achieved during the summer melt season along a approx. 17 km stretch of the approx. 50 km of <b>flowline</b> within the ablation zone. Beneath {{the majority of the}} <b>flowline,</b> subglacial conduit storage closes (i. e. obtains minimum radius) during the winter and opens (i. e. obtains maximum radius) during the summer. Along certain stretches of the <b>flowline,</b> the model predicts that subglacial conduit storage remains open throughout the year. A calculated mean glacier water residence time of approx. 2. 2 years implies that significant amounts of water are stored in the glacier throughout the year. We interpret this residence time as being indicative of the timescale over which the glacier hydrologic system is capable of adjusting to external surface meltwater forcings. Based on in situ ice velocity observations, we suggest that the summer speed-up event generally corresponds to conditions of increasing hydraulic head during inefficient subglacial drainage. Conversely, the slowdown during fall generally corresponds to conditions of decreasing hydraulic head during efficient subglacial drainage...|$|R
40|$|Onshore oil {{production}} pipelines are major installations in the petroleum industry, stretching {{many thousands of}} kilometres worldwide which also contain <b>flowline</b> additives. The current study focuses {{on the effect of}} the <b>flowline</b> additives on soil physico-chemical and biological properties and quantified the impact using resilience and resistance indices. Our findings are the first to highlight deleterious effect of <b>flowline</b> additives by altering some fundamental soil properties, including a complete loss of structural integrity of the impacted soil and a reduced capacity to degrade hydrocarbons mainly due to: (i) phosphonate salts (in scale inhibitor) prevented accumulation of scale in pipelines but also disrupted soil physical structure; (ii) glutaraldehyde (in biocides) which repressed microbial activity in the pipeline and reduced hydrocarbon degradation in soil upon environmental exposure; (iii) the combinatory effects of these two chemicals synergistically caused severe soil structural collapse and disruption of microbial degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons...|$|R
40|$|We first {{analytically}} {{determine the}} relationship between velocity field and isochrone geometry along a steady <b>flowline</b> of an ice sheet. The method {{is based upon the}} stream function and its vertically normalized form, the normalized stream function (NSF). We show that the slope of the isochrones is the slope of the iso-NSF lines, plus a path term which is the cumulative result of the past trajectory of the ice particles. Secondly, we show how this property can be used to infer the internal velocity field from isochrones along a <b>flowline</b> with known mass balance conditions. We illustrate the method on two different situations: varying basal sliding and varying velocity profile around a divide. Third and finally, we show how internal layers can be inverted to infer the surface accumulation rate and we apply this method on a <b>flowline</b> downstream of the EPICA Dronning Maud Land drilling site...|$|R
