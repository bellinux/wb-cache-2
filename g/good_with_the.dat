Due to distraction from his neighbours on the Balkan frontier, Manuel was kept from his main objective, the subjugation of the Normans of Sicily. Relations had been <b>good</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Serbs and Hungarians since 1129, so the Serb rebellion came as a shock. The Serbs of Rascia, being so induced by Roger II of Sicily, invaded Byzantine territory in 1149.|$|E

500|$|Julius Carry saw great {{potential}} {{in the character of}} Bowler. He had researched black cowboys for a project in college and used that knowledge in his portrayal of Bowler. Carry said that Bowler was similar to the real-life black deputy U.S. Marshal Bass Reeves, in that [...] "Reeves always got his man and would often pull off incredible tricks to bring people in." [...] Carry knew Clemenson from the time they worked together on the Western television pilot Independence. He had no knowledge of Campbell, but approved of the choice for the leading man after watching Army of Darkness. He later told Starlog, [...] "I saw that he would be very <b>good</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> physical stuff and that he could deliver a one-liner. I knew the situation would be good." [...] The original direction for Bowler was to have him constantly oppose Brisco, but as the series progressed the writers saw the good-natured chemistry between the actors and decided to make Brisco and Bowler a team. Bowler's race was never an issue in the show. [...] According to Cary Darling, a television critic, this attitude is different from serious Westerns and [...] "may hew more to the truth than one might think". [...] He said historians have noted that black cowboys were common and that conflicts with white cowboys were rare.|$|E

It's pretty twisted." [...] Weiland's lyrics reflected on his relationship with his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, and his history with drug abuse. Speaking of the at-times strange lyrics, Weiland cited The Beatles' [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] as an inspiration.

[...] "Between the Lines" [...] was originally the working title of the song, which Weiland incorporated into his lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Mystic Quest was {{developed}} in a graphic and gameplay style similar to Final Fantasy Legend III (part of the aforementioned SaGa series). The gameplay shares numerous similarities with that title, featuring a very similar battle system, graphical interface, and dungeon system. Even the jump feature from Final Fantasy Legend III has been reproduced, {{and almost all of}} the icons - from caves to the enemy sprites - are a color-upgraded version of Final Fantasy Legend IIIs character set. Besides allowing for computer-controlled allies, the game did away with random battles, complicated storylines, and text-based menus. To appeal to the perceived tastes of North American audiences, which gravitated towards fast-paced games, Square included action-adventure game elements; players could now brandish weapons outside of battle, jump, use a grappling hook, and set bombs to open new paths. North American translator Ted Woolsey explained that [...] "The action/adventure players...are larger in numbers and the demographic is different. They tend to be younger and like the idea of jumping straight into the action with a sword in their hands; it's an empowerment issue - you get to go out there, start whacking things and it feels <b>good!</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> more traditional RPGs, it takes a good 15 or 20 hours of playing before you're finally hooked." [...] Woolsey stated that Mystic Quest was one of the easiest games he had to translate, due to the game's small size. Because the game was marketed towards a younger demographic, the game sold for US$39.99. Mystic Quest also came with an Official Strategy Guide that helped inexperienced and new RPG players complete it.|$|E
