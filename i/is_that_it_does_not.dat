5|$|A {{somewhat}} different design of cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach is called a rotary broach or wobble broach. One of the biggest advantages {{to this type of}} broaching <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> require a broaching machine, but instead is used on lathes, milling machines, screw machines or Swiss lathes.|$|E

25|$|A {{distinguishing}} {{characteristic of}} Temple Food <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> use the common five strong-flavoured ingredients of Korean cuisine--(garlic, spring onion, wild rocambole, leek, and ginger), and meat.|$|E
25|$|An initial {{limitation}} of the twin design <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> afford an opportunity to consider both Shared Environment and Non-additive genetic effects simultaneously. This limit can be addressed by including additional siblings to the design.|$|E
25|$|The D'Amico {{classification}} stratifies men by low, intermediate, or {{high risk}} based on stage, grade, and PSA. It is used widely in clinical practice and research settings. The major downside to the 3-level system <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> account for multiple adverse parameters (e.g., high Gleason score and high PSA) in stratifying patients.|$|E

25|$|The {{positive}} tradeoff {{of using}} applicative order <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> cause unnecessary computation, if all arguments are used, because it never substitutes arguments containing redexes and hence never needs to copy them (which would duplicate work). In the above example, in applicative order (λx.xx) ((λx.x)y) reduces first to (λx.xx)y {{and then to}} the normal order yy, taking two steps instead of three.|$|E
25|$|Under the VEI, ash, lava, lava {{bombs and}} {{ignimbrite}} are all treated alike. Density and vesicularity (gas bubbling) of the volcanic products {{in question is}} not taken into account. In contrast, the DRE (dense-rock equivalent) is sometimes calculated to give the actual amount of magma erupted. Another weakness of the VEI <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> {{take into account the}} power output of an eruption, which makes the VEI extremely difficult to determine with prehistoric or unobserved eruptions.|$|E
25|$|The main {{advantage}} of the flux balance approach <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> require any knowledge of the metabolite concentrations, or more importantly, the enzyme kinetics of the system; the homeostasis assumption precludes the need for knowledge of metabolite concentrations at any time {{as long as that}} quantity remains constant, and additionally it removes the need for specific rate laws since it assumes that at steady state, there is no change {{in the size of the}} metabolite pool in the system. The stoichiometric coefficients alone are sufficient for the mathematical maximization of a specific objective function.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} downside {{with this}} method of classification <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not distinguish between particular classes of locomotive, so many very different types would have been classified '4F' for instance.|$|R
50|$|The {{value of}} such a craft at the time <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not depend on wind to propel it, and it could operate stealthily in and around harbors and rivers at night.|$|R
30|$|The main {{drawbacks}} of this metric <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> {{not distinguish}} {{the qualities of}} the good links of a path, and the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may not {{take into consideration the}} hop count of a path.|$|R
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used woods are Sitka spruce and Douglas fir, which offer excellent strength-to-weight ratios. Wooden structural members are joined with adhesive, usually epoxy. Unlike the wood construction techniques used in other applications, virtually all wooden joints in aircraft are simple butt joints, with plywood gussets. Joints {{are designed to be}} stronger than the members. After the structure has been completed, the aircraft is covered in aircraft fabric (usually aircraft-grade polyester). The advantage of this type of construction <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> require complex tools and equipment, but commonplace items such as saw, planer, file, sandpaper, and clamps.|$|E
25|$|A major {{criticism}} {{leveled at}} this justification <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> fulfill {{one of the}} requirements of a just war and that in waging war preemptively, the United States undermined international law and {{the authority of the}} United Nations, particularly the United Nations Security Council. On this ground, by invading a country that did not pose an imminent threat without UN support, the U.S. violated international law, including the UN Charter and the Nuremberg principles, therefore committing a war of aggression, which is considered a war crime. Additional criticism raised the point that the United States might have set a precedent, under the premise of which any nation could justify the invasion of other states.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} proposed, {{originally}} in the Druidic journal Aisling that Gardner's New Forest coven was the pagan {{section of the}} Order of Woodcraft Chivalry; this order performed rituals in the New Forest in the early 1920s and its pagan section honoured a moon goddess and a horned god, and believed in ritual nakedness. One of Ronald Hutton's informants reports that Gardner was familiar with this order at least by the 1950s. A major difficulty with identifying this group with the New Forest coven <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> appear to have met in the New Forest between 1934 and 1945. Gardner records a working by the coven in the New Forest in 1940 against the projected Nazi invasion.|$|E

30|$|Other {{problems}} of the proposed method <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not consider the character’s emotions and behaviors/activities.

25|$|A {{particularly}} prominent {{criticism of}} strong reciprocity theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> correspond to behavior {{found in the}} actual environment. In particular, the existence of third party punishment {{in the field is}} called into question. Some have responded to this criticism by pointing out that if effective, third party punishment will rarely be used, and will therefore be difficult to observe. Others have suggested that there is evidence of third party costly punishment in the field. Critics have responded to these claims by arguing that it is unfair for proponents to argue that both a demonstration of costly third party punishment as well as a lack of costly third party punishment are both evidence of its existence. They also question whether the ethnographic evidence presented is costly third party punishment, and call for additional analysis of {{the costs and benefits of}} the punishment. Other research has shown that different types of strong reciprocity do not predict other types of strong reciprocity within individuals.|$|E
25|$|A further {{limitation}} of the correlation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> necessarily imply that the causality runs from income to health. It could actually be that better health, as proxied by life expectancy, contributes to higher incomes, rather than vice versa. Better health can increase incomes because healthier individuals {{tend to be more}} productive than sick ones; on average they work harder, longer and are more capable of focusing efficiently on production tasks. Furthermore, better health may affect not just the level of income but also its growth rate through its effect on education. Healthier children spend more time at school and learn faster, thus acquiring more human capital which translates into higher growth rates of incomes later in life. Diseases such as malaria can short circuit these processes. Likewise there is evidence that more healthy individuals save more and thus contribute to the faster accumulation of physical capital of an economy. Jeffrey Sachs in particular has emphasized the role that the disease burden has played in the impoverishment of countries located in the tropical zones.|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} {{disadvantage of}} the impedance analogy <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> preserve the topology {{of the mechanical}} system.

500|$|The {{principal}} {{disadvantage of}} the mobility analogy <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> maintain the analogy between electrical and mechanical impedance. [...] Mechanical impedance is represented as an electrical admittance and a mechanical resistance is represented as an electrical conductance in the electrical equivalent circuit. [...] Force is not analogous to voltage (generator voltages are often called electromotive force), but rather, it {{is analogous to}} current.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, this {{rule of thumb}} came into being, {{developed}} by R. H. Kraft. [...] It was noted from rainfall amounts (in imperial units) reported by the first order rainfall network in the United States that the storm total rainfall fit a simple equation: [...] 100 divided by the speed of motion in knots. [...] This rule works, even in other countries, {{as long as a}} tropical cyclone is moving and only the first order or synoptic station network (with observations spaced about [...] apart) are used to derive storm totals. [...] Canada uses {{a modified version of the}} Kraft rule which divides the results by a factor of two, which takes into account the lower sea surface temperatures seen around Atlantic Canada and the prevalence of systems undergoing vertical wind shear at their northerly latitudes. [...] The main problem with this rule is that the rainfall observing network is denser than either the synoptic reporting network or the first order station networks, which means the absolute maximum is likely to be underestimated. [...] Another problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> take the size of the tropical cyclone or topography into account.|$|E
500|$|In {{a lecture}} {{to a group}} of law {{students}} shortly before the decision was released, Harlan commented that the Chinese had long been excluded from American society [...] "upon the idea that this is a race utterly foreign to us and never will assimilate with us." [...] Without the exclusion legislation, Harlan stated his opinion that vast numbers of Chinese [...] "would have rooted out the American population" [...] in the western United States. Acknowledging the opposing view supporting citizenship for American-born Chinese, he said that [...] "Of course, the argument on the other side is that the very words of the constitution embrace such a case." [...] Commenting on the Wong Kim Ark case shortly after the issuance of the Court's ruling in 1898, San Francisco attorney Marshall B. Woodworth wrote that [...] "the error the dissent apparently falls into <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> recognize that the United States, as a sovereign power, has the right to adopt any rule of citizenship it may see fit, and that the rule of international law does not furnish [...] the sole and exclusive test of citizenship of the United States".|$|E
