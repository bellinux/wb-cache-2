50|$|Faroese sheep tend to {{have very}} little <b>flocking</b> <b>instinct</b> due to no natural predators, and will range freely year round in small groups in pastureland, which ranges from meadows, to rugged rocky mountaintops and lush bird-cliffs. They are most {{closely related to the}} Norwegian Spælsau and Icelandic sheep.|$|E
50|$|This breed has {{extremely}} fine fleece and, {{in contrast}} to mouflon, the inner fleece is highly developed {{and it is difficult}} to distinguish an outer coat. This is a clear indication that the Soay are indeed the product of a domesticated breed in prehistoric times. The breed also lacks the <b>flocking</b> <b>instinct</b> of many breeds. Attempts to work them using sheep dogs result in a scattering of the group.|$|E
50|$|The Katahdin is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} sheep developed in Maine, United States and named after Mount Katahdin - the highest peak in Maine. The breed was developed during {{in the second}} half of the 20th century by Michael Piel who, after reading an article in the February 1956 National Geographic, imported selected St. Croix sheep chosen by Dr. Richard Marshall Bond, Director of the Virgin Islands branch of the U.S.D.A., and crossed them with various other breeds including the Suffolk, selecting lambs based on hair coat, meat-type conformation, high fertility, and <b>flocking</b> <b>instinct.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Originally it is {{compact and}} lightly built {{and does not}} need much {{concentrated}} food. The meat has relatively little fat. The Spælsau gives rich milk, has a strong <b>flock</b> <b>instinct,</b> and manages well outdoors most of the year. But it is vulnerable to eye disease caused by eating the plant Bog Asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum). Wool colours include black and white but common among older types (Gamalnorsk and Villsau) are many variations and shades of grey (known as `blue`) and brown (known as `red`) ...|$|R
5000|$|The Meatmaster is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} sheep native to South Africa. Bred {{in the early}} 1990s from various hair sheep breeds, the Meatmaster was created {{with the goal of}} improving the meat characteristics of African fat-tailed sheep breeds. The fat-tailed sheep had various advantageous characteristics such as hardiness and suitability for desert life, but was slow to mature, had a poor distribution of fat and lacked the muscling of the hind quarters of European breeds. The composite breed increased the amount of muscle and had a better distribution of fat but retained the hair (rather than wool) coat and other desirable traits such as resistance to tick-borne diseases and a good <b>flocking</b> <b>instinct.</b>|$|E
