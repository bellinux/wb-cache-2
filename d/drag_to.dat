5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} interacts with the stellar wind. As the wind {{moves away from the}} star its rate of angular velocity slows. The {{magnetic field}} of the star interacts with the wind, which applies a <b>drag</b> <b>to</b> the stellar rotation. As a result, angular momentum is transferred from the star to the wind, and over time this gradually slows the star's rate of rotation.|$|E
25|$|The {{students}} at Akaflieg Berlin {{set out to}} improve the performance of modern gliders by reducing <b>drag.</b> <b>To</b> improve a modern glider's performance through modifying the aerofoil sections is time consuming and very costly, so to reduce costs the group utilised production wings from a Schemp-Hirth Janus B, shortened to 18.2m (59.71 feet), allowing the students to concentrate their efforts and budget on improving the fuselage.|$|E

25|$|During gliding, lift {{plays an}} {{increased}} role. Like drag, lift {{is proportional to}} velocity squared. Gliding animals will typically leap or drop from high locations such as trees, just as in parachuting, and as gravitational acceleration increases their speed, the aerodynamic forces also increase. Because the animal can utilize lift and <b>drag</b> <b>to</b> generate greater aerodynamic force, it can glide at a shallower angle than parachuting animals, allowing it to cover greater horizontal distance in the same loss of altitude, and reach trees further away.|$|E

25|$|The Ju 88C was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} fighter-bomber and heavy fighter by adding fixed, forward-firing guns to the nose while retaining some bomb carrying ability of the A-series bomber. The C-series had a solid metal nose, typically housing one 20mm MG FF cannon and three 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 machine guns. The aircraft retained the ventral Bola gondola under the crew compartment though individual units sometimes removed this to reduce weight and <b>drag</b> <b>to</b> enhance performance. The Ju-88C was later used as a night fighter, and this became its main role.|$|E

25|$|Lever drags {{work through}} cam action to {{increase}} or decrease pressure on the drag washers located on the spool itself. Most lever drags offer preset drag positions for strike (reduced <b>drag</b> <b>to</b> avoid tearing the hook out of the fish), full (used once the hook is set) and freespool (see above). Lever drags are simpler and faster to adjust during the fight. And, since they use the spool for the washer stack rather than the drive gear, the washers can be larger, offering more resistance and smoother action. The disadvantage is that in freespool, there can be residual and unwanted resistance since the drag mechanism may not be {{completely out of the}} picture without resorting to more complex mechanics.|$|E
25|$|According to Le Sage's theory, an {{isolated}} body {{is subjected to}} drag {{if it is in}} motion relative to the unique isotropic frame of the ultramundane flux (i.e., the frame in which the speed of the ultramundane corpuscles is the same in all directions). This {{is due to the fact}} that, if a body is in motion, the particles striking the body from the front have a higher speed (relative to the body) than those striking the body from behind - this effect will act to decrease the distance between the sun and the earth. The magnitude of this drag is proportional to vu, where v is the speed of the particles and u is the speed of the body, whereas the characteristic force of gravity is proportional to v2, so the ratio of <b>drag</b> <b>to</b> gravitational force is proportional to u/v. Thus for a given characteristic strength of gravity, the amount of drag for a given speed u can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the speed v of the ultramundane corpuscles. However, in order to reduce the <b>drag</b> <b>to</b> an acceptable level (i.e., consistent with observation) in terms of classical mechanics, the speed v must be many orders of magnitude greater than the speed of light. This makes Le Sage theory fundamentally incompatible with the modern science of mechanics based on special relativity, according to which no particle (or wave) can exceed the speed of light. In addition, even if superluminal particles were possible, the effective temperature of such a flux would be sufficient to incinerate all ordinary matter in a fraction of a second.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} reel or trolling reel {{is similar}} to the baitcasting reel. There are two types of trolling reels, star drag reels and lever drag reels. Star drag reels are like baitcasters, but you move a little lever to put it into free spool. They have a star drag and you have to keep your thumb on them to keep off backlash. The lever drag reel uses the <b>drag</b> <b>to</b> put itself into free spool. It is very difficult to cast a conventional reel, most oven line is dropped behind a boat and left to drift. Conventional reels are for really big fish and are usually used offshore. They are designed for trolling but can also be used for butterfly jigging and Deep-sea fishing ("deep drop"). They are mounted on short rods.|$|E

25|$|Grooming {{attachments}} – Attachments {{for large}} groomers include: a front blade, a tiller, a renovator and track setter. The leading front blade repositions snow {{in front of}} the machine for trailing equipment to recondition. The renovator digs into the snow pack to aerate and mix the old and new snow up to 30cm deep, as needed. The tiller attached behind the machine conditions the snow into aa soft, granular consistency, ready for its comb, which packs the snow into a finished surface. For setting classic tracks, the groomer trails special pans, which mould the tracks. Attachments for snowmobiles perform the same functions at a smaller scale and include a roller to compact the snow over a wide swath and a <b>drag</b> <b>to</b> level the snow behind the roller.|$|E
25|$|The XP-82 {{was to be}} {{powered by}} two Packard-built Rolls-Royce V-1650 Merlin engines. Initially, the left engine was a V-1650-23 with a gear {{reduction}} box to allow the left propeller to turn opposite to the right propeller, which was driven by the more conventional V-1650-25. In this arrangement both propellers would turn upward {{as they approached the}} center wing, which in theory would have allowed better single-engine control. This proved not to be the case when the aircraft refused to become airborne during its first flight attempt. After a month of work North American engineers finally discovered that rotating the propellers to meet in the center on their upward turn created sufficient <b>drag</b> <b>to</b> cancel out all lift from the center wing section, one quarter of the aircraft's total wing surface area. The engines and propellers were then exchanged, with their rotation meeting on the downward turn, and the problem was fully solved. The first XP-82 prototype (44-83886) was completed on 25 May 1945, and made the type's first successful flight on 26 June 1945. This aircraft was accepted by the Army Air Forces on 30 August 1945, whose officials were so impressed by the aircraft, while still in development, that they ordered the first production P-82Bs in March 1945, fully three months before its first flight.|$|E

500|$|Mirs deorbit {{was carried}} out in three stages. The first stage {{involved}} waiting for atmospheric <b>drag</b> <b>to</b> reduce the station's orbit to an average of [...] This began with the docking of Progress M1-5, {{a modified version of the}} Progress-M carrying 2.5 times more fuel in place of supplies. The second stage was the transfer of the station into a 165×220km (103×137mi) orbit. This was achieved with two burns of Progress M1-5's control engines at 00:32 UTC and 02:01 UTC on 23 March 2001. After a two-orbit pause, the third and final stage of the deorbit began with the burn of Progress M1-5's control engines and main engine at 05:08 UTC, lasting 22+ minutes. Atmospheric reentry (arbitrarily defined beginning at 100km/60mi AMSL) occurred at 05:44 UTC near Nadi, Fiji. Major destruction of the station began around 05:52 UTC and most of the unburned fragments fell into the South Pacific Ocean around 06:00 UTC.|$|E

500|$|A six-inch manilla rope {{was passed}} from the tanker's stern to the destroyer's midship oiling bollard, the idea being to take the stern to port, whilst the {{minesweeper}} [...] towed her; but Ledbury put on too much weight and the minesweeper's tow parted. Penn then asked Ledbury to take the tanker in tow from ahead, which was done, using the tanker's tow and a shackle of Ledburys towing hawser-cable. Rye took the destroyer in tow to keep the ship from falling off, whilst Penn went alongside the starboard side of the tanker {{to act as a}} <b>drag</b> <b>to</b> keep her straight. Ledburys gunner, {{who was in charge of}} the towing party on board the tanker tried out all the tanker's guns, which proved valuable as at 10:44 the flotilla was attacked by nine Stukas. Just before the attack, American survivors from the merchantman Santa Elisa asked Commander Hill to take a party aboard Ohio to repair and man one of the anti-aircraft guns, an offer gratefully accepted by Ledburys captain. In the attack, Ledbury received a near miss within a few feet of the fo'c'sle, which fortunately was an oil bomb and caused no casualties. There was also a near miss astern. Help was however on the way, since Malta based Spitfires covered the ships and broke many enemy formations. This was the last successful attack, and Ledbury, Penn and Bramham secured either side of the tanker, and by some very skilful seamanship and endurance on the part of the crews brought Ohio into Valletta Harbour.|$|E

2500|$|The Goshawk was {{developed}} from the Kestrel IV prototype engine, to use evaporative (also known as [...] "steam") cooling. Rather than keep the cooling liquid below its boiling point in the cooling system, the coolant was allowed to boil; the phase change from liquid to vapour takes more heat from the engine, so less coolant is needed. However, instead of a radiator to take {{the heat from the}} coolant, a condensor was required to turn the vapour back to liquid.

2500|$|With {{spinning}} reels, closed-face reels {{and conventional}} reels with star drags, {{a good starting}} point is to set the <b>drag</b> <b>to</b> about one-third to one-half the breaking strength of the line.

For lever drag reels with a strike position, most anglers start by setting the drag at the strike position to one-third the break strength of the line. This usually allows the full position to still be safely under the line rating while providing flexibility during the fight. Depending on the conditions, some anglers may leave their reels in freespool then setting the anti-reverse or engaging the drag on hookup.|$|E
