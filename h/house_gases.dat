The behaviour of ducks, broilers, laying hens and turkeys was observed to assess differences in susceptibility between species and to assess animal welfare implications following exposure to CO 2 treatment. All birds were individually exposed to CO 2 concentrations, which increased from 0 % to 45 % {{at a rate of}} 14 l/min. The results discussed in this paper suggest that there are slight to occasionally significant differences, which might also be age related between different poultry species exposed to whole <b>house</b> <b>gassing</b> with CO 2. However, these differences are not so substantial so as to make it necessary to set different welfare criteria in relation to whole <b>house</b> <b>gassing</b> for the examined species...|$|R

40|$|This {{work has}} been carried out as part of the REFIT project (‘Personalised Retrofit Decision Support Tools for UK Homes using Smart Home Technology’, £ 1. 5 m, Grant Reference EP/K 002457 / 1). A simple {{data-driven}} Lumped Parameter thermal model is developed linking the radiator surface temperature to the whole <b>house</b> <b>gas</b> consumption using operational data collected from a real house. The indoor room air temperatures, the radiator surface temperatures and the whole <b>house</b> <b>gas</b> consumption are used as input data. The model parameters are estimated using the Ordinary Least Squares technique. Results show that an improved fit can be achieved by excluding data points for which gas consumption is being used for purposes other than space heating using a lower threshold (Tr,pred-Tr,meas) of 1 oC during the model calibration. Finally, the model is applied to disaggregate the gas consumption data that are linked to space heating from the original whole <b>house</b> <b>gas</b> consumption at half -hourly intervals...|$|R

5000|$|Increase in population, Economic {{issues are}} the some factors which have {{escalated}} the energy demand across the world. In developed countries, {{the growth rate}} of energy consumption rate is 1.1%/year while in developing countries the energy consumption growth rate approximately 3 time to that of developed countries. Beside this high growth in energy consumption it also causes to increase the production of green <b>house</b> <b>gases</b> to the atmosphere. The increase in demand of energy, limited resource of convention energy sources, hike in conventional fuel prices, global warming are some important factors which Impetus us to adopt energy saving techniques and alternative sources of energy. Building sector consumes one third of world's resources. Building currently shares approximately 40% of energy in most of the countries and are considered among the largest end-use sector. As per International energy agency (IEA) world energy consumption and green <b>house</b> <b>gases</b> level is going to increase rapidly every year. IEA recognize the building sector {{as one of the most}} cost effective sector where energy consumption can be reduced [...] It is estimated that the energy consumption can be reduced to 1509 million tonnes of equivalent (Mtoe) and at the same time it will cause to reduce the green <b>house</b> <b>gases</b> production up to 12.6 gigatonnes(Gt) by 2050.
