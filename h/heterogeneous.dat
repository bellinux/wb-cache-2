25|$|<b>Heterogeneous</b> {{catalysts}} for hydrogenation {{are more}} common industrially. As in homogeneous catalysts, the activity is adjusted through changes in the environment around the metal, i.e. the coordination sphere. Different faces of a crystalline <b>heterogeneous</b> catalyst display distinct activities, for example. Similarly, <b>heterogeneous</b> catalysts are affected by their supports, i.e. the material upon with the <b>heterogeneous</b> catalyst is bound.|$|E

25|$|Catalysts {{are usually}} {{classified}} into two broad classes: homogeneous catalysts and <b>heterogeneous</b> catalysts.

25|$|George Bentham {{published}} his {{arrangement of the}} Banksia in his landmark 1870 publication Flora Australiensis. The number of recognised Banksia species was reduced to 46, and Meissner's four <b>heterogeneous</b> series were replaced by four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters, taking the number of sections to five. Three of these sections were fairly well-defined and homogeneous, while another, Orthostylis, was somewhat <b>heterogeneous.</b> The fourth, Cyrtostylis, was erected to contain the species that did not belong in the other sections, and was therefore highly <b>heterogeneous.</b> Despite these shortcomings, this arrangement would stand for over 100 years.|$|E

25|$|<b>Heterogeneous</b> {{catalysts}} {{are usually}} solids, powdered {{in order to}} maximize their surface area. Of particular importance in <b>heterogeneous</b> catalysis are the platinum group metals and other transition metals, which are used in hydrogenations, catalytic reforming and in the synthesis of commodity chemicals such as nitric acid and ammonia. Acids are an example of a homogeneous catalyst, they increase the nucleophilicity of carbonyls, allowing a reaction that would not otherwise proceed with electrophiles. The advantage of homogeneous catalysts is the ease of mixing them with the reactants, but they may also be difficult to separate from the products. Therefore, <b>heterogeneous</b> catalysts are preferred in many industrial processes.|$|E

25|$|George {{followed}} Brown in dividing Banksia {{into two}} subgenera, Banksia and Isostylis. He then divided subgenus Banksia into two sections: Banksia for species with straight or slightly curved styles, and Oncostylis for species with hooked styles. These two sections were then divided into nine and three series respectively. The arrangement into series largely followed Bentham, with series Orthostylis remaining somewhat <b>heterogeneous,</b> and Cyrtostylis remaining highly <b>heterogeneous.</b>|$|E

25|$|The most-general {{method of}} {{asymmetric}} pyridine hydrogenation {{is actually a}} <b>heterogeneous</b> method, where asymmetry is generated from a chiral oxazolidinone bound to the C2 position of the pyridine. Hydrogenating such functionalized pyridines {{over a number of}} different <b>heterogeneous</b> metal catalysts gave the corresponding piperidine with the substituents at C3, C4, and C5 positions in an all-cis geometry, in high yield and excellent enantioselectivity. The oxazolidinone auxiliary is also conveniently cleaved under the hydrogenation conditions.|$|E

25|$|In catalysis, the {{reaction}} does not proceed directly, but through reaction {{with a third}} substance known as catalyst. Although the catalyst takes part in {{the reaction}}, it is returned to its original state {{by the end of}} the reaction and so is not consumed. However, it can be inhibited, deactivated or destroyed by secondary processes. Catalysts can be used in a different phase (<b>heterogeneous)</b> or in the same phase (homogeneous) as the reactants. In <b>heterogeneous</b> catalysis, typical secondary processes include coking where the catalyst becomes covered by polymeric side products. Additionally, <b>heterogeneous</b> catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid–liquid system or evaporate in a solid–gas system. Catalysts can only speed up the reaction – chemicals that slow down the reaction are called inhibitors. Substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters, and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons. With a catalyst, a reaction which is kinetically inhibited by a high activation energy can take place in circumvention of this activation energy.|$|E

According to Charles Holcombe, the early Tujue population was rather <b>heterogeneous</b> {{and many of the}} names of Türk rulers, including the two founding members, are not even Turkic.
