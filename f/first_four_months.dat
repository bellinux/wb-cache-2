Furthermore within the <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>month</b> after leaving the programme, the estimated effect was about half a month additional employment for the participants.

5|$|During the off-season, it was {{revealed}} that Kesler had been playing with a shoulder injury since February 2012. Suffering from a torn labrum, he underwent surgery for the injury in May. Initially expected to have recovered by mid-November, his rehabilitation was extended for several months due to an additional wrist injury which he received surgery for in late-June. As a result, he made his 2012–13 season debut on February 15, 2013, in a 4–3 loss to the Dallas Stars. Due to the NHL lockout, which cancelled the <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> of the season, Kesler only missed 12 games. Within seven games, however, Kesler was back on the injured reserve with a broken foot. He initially sustained the injury in his first game against Dallas, but subsequent X-rays came back negative.

5|$|Government of Ontario Transit (later {{abbreviated}} as 'GO Transit') {{started as}} a three-year long experiment on May 23, 1967 running single-deck trains powered by diesel locomotives in push-pull configuration on a single rail line along Lake Ontario's shoreline. GO Train service ran throughout the day from Oakville to Pickering with limited rush hour train service to Hamilton. The experiment proved to be extremely popular; GO Transit carried its first million riders during its <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>months,</b> and averaged 15,000 per day soon after. This line, now divided as the Lakeshore East and Lakeshore West lines is the keystone corridor of GO Transit. Expansion of rail service continued in the 1970s and 1980s, aimed at developing ridership in {{with the introduction of}} the Georgetown (now Kitchener) line in 1974 and the Richmond Hill line in 1978. The Milton GO Train line opened in 1981, followed by the Bradford (now Barrie) and Stouffville lines a year later, establishing the 7 rail corridors that today's rail service is based upon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the idea}} of Matt Bozon, who created the game's {{universe}} based on Erin's character, at the beginning, the game was planned for the SNES or PC. He and Erin pitched the game with help from veteran programmer Jimmy Huey, who worked with WayForward at the time. After the completion of Xtreme Sports, Voldi Way, the founder and owner of WayForward, greenlit a Game Boy Color version of the game. As Huey had already built a graphics engine for Xtreme Sports, this engine was adapted to suit Shantaes needs. This allowed the game to showcase rare effects on GBC games, like parallax scrolling and transparency effects. In the <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> of development, the team created most of the animation, and Huey programmed an art-capturing tool that allowed to take full-colored animation frames, turn them into three-colour chunks and reassemble the whole on the GBC's screen.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes {{started his}} {{football}} career at non-League side Newmarket Town, {{breaking into the}} club's youth team {{at the age of}} 17.

He scored 21goals for Newmarket in the Eastern Counties League during the <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> of the 2003–04 season. After trials with Yeovil, Norwich and Ipswich Town, Rhodes signed with Brentford in November 2003 for £10,000.

In total, Trump received $300 million from the sale of the condominiums, which more than offset the $200 million cost of construction. However, by 1991, Trump was already involved in lawsuits against residents: in October of that year, he successfully sued actor Pia Zadora and her husband, businessman Meshulam Riklis, to collect $1 million in unpaid rent.|$|E
