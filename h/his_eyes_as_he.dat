5|$|Alexander swore {{the oath}} of loyalty to the Greek {{constitution}} {{on the afternoon of}} 11 June 1917 in the ballroom of the Royal Palace. Apart from the Archbishop of Athens, Theocletus I, who administered the oath, only King Constantine I, Crown Prince George and the king's prime minister, Alexandros Zaimis, attended. There were no festivities. The 23-year-old Alexander had a broken voice and tears in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> made the solemn declaration. He knew that the Entente and the Venizelists would hold real power and that neither his father nor his brother had renounced their claims to the throne. Constantine had informed his son that he should consider himself a regent, rather than a true monarch.|$|E
25|$|Watching Shastri bat is like {{admiring the}} Qutub Minar; tall, timeless, solid. You admire {{it for the}} virtues, not for its style. For nine hours and 21 minutes, he chiselled away the England attack and the {{sculpture}} that he left behind represented perseverance and craft. There was the usual stoic, expressionless face under the helmet, but {{you could see the}} determination in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> planted himself at the wicket, struck root and bore fruit.|$|E
25|$|Nicholas's life passes before <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> falls. He smashes {{through a}} glass roof and lands on a giant air bag. Emergency medical {{technicians}} carefully remove him, and he finds himself in a ballroom full of his friends, family, and every figure involved in his Game; it had been just a game all along. Conrad is alive and well, and explains that he initiated the game to get his brother to embrace life and not to end up like their father. Nicholas bursts into tears, relaxes, and begins to enjoy the party once his shock has dissipated. When he sees that Christine has left the party, he follows her outside to her cab. He asks her to dinner, and she offers to share a coffee with him before her flight takes her to her next game assignment in Australia.|$|E
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> glanced suspiciously at his wife, fell on Trudaine's gift-book, {{which she}} still held unconsciously.|$|R
60|$|Deringham {{took up the}} paper, {{and again}} there was the little {{movement}} {{at the corners of}} <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> read.|$|R
60|$|Lord Ormersfield {{had heard}} these few last words, {{and there was}} deep thought in <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> bade <b>his</b> cousins {{farewell}} at the hall door.|$|R
25|$|Kate and Sawyer {{travel to}} Hydra Island via Desmond's boat Elizabeth, {{to the site}} of the Ajira Airlines plane where Lapidus, Richard and Miles have been quickly trying to make it air-worthy. Kate convinces Claire she can help her raise Aaron and they head for the plane. After Kate, Sawyer and Claire board the plane, Lapidus {{successfully}} gets it off the island. Jack leads Hurley and Ben back to the heart of the Island, where Jack convinces an emotional Hurley to take over as the protector of the island, stating Hurley was always meant to be the leader. Hurley and Ben lower Jack to the dry pool where he rescues a barely conscious Desmond. Jack manages to restore the light by replacing the stone plug, and is enveloped in the light that surrounds him. Hurley, in his role as the new protector of the island, does not know what to do. Ben tells him he should help Desmond get home and suggests there may be a better way of protecting the island than how Jacob did. Hurley asks him for help, and Ben is honored. Jack reawakens outside by a river and walks toward the bamboo forest. After Jack collapses to the ground, Vincent approaches him and lies next to him. Jack gazes happily at the sky while watching the Ajira plane fly overhead away from the island. Jack slowly closes <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> dies.|$|E
500|$|His father coached {{him until}} high school, and was {{especially}} tough. When Kinsler was 13 years old, {{and the best}} player on a PONY league team coached by his father that was playing for a championship, his dad caught Kinsler rolling <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> gave the team orders. [...] "I benched him, without hesitation", said his father. With Kinsler on the bench, the team lost the game.|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 12 {{midnight on}} 21 September 1986, Wood {{went to the}} playroom in the mansion and killed his mistress Danielle Ledez by shooting her once in the head. [...] Ledez was 10 weeks pregnant by Wood. [...] Wood then proceeded to play hide-and-seek with Ledez's daughter Stephanie (aged 3), after which he led her into Christopher's bedroom and shot her twice in the head, killing her instantly. He then took Ledez's son Christopher (aged 5) {{into the bathroom and}} told him to close <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had a surprise for him, then shot him twice in the head. Wood then bludgeoned the boy with a large ruler four or five times {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, child, what is it?" [...] she asked, {{catching}} <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> stole a shy {{glance at}} her, {{one of many}} which she had not seen.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a slight}} flush on his cheeks, an added lustre in <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> took Wilding's hand and shook it heartily before Wilding had time to kiss His Grace's.|$|R
60|$|To-night Mr. Ketchmaid, meeting <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{entered the}} bar, nodded curtly. The {{shoemaker}} had stayed away three {{days as a}} protest, and the landlord was naturally indignant at such contumacy.|$|R
500|$|Everyone who was {{fortunate}} enough to be in the audience agreed that it was the musical event of their lives, and after the performance of the last number there was an ovation to the composer which I have never seen equalled anywhere, the entire audience rose to their feet and shouted with enthusiasm, and probably the calmest man in the whole hall was the composer himself; he bowed repeatedly with that distinction of manner which was so typical of him... As calm as Sibelius had appeared on the stage, after his part was over he came up stairs and sank into a chair in one of the dressing rooms and was very much overcome. Some people declared that he wept. Personally I do not think that he did, but there were tears in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> shook our hands and thanked us for what he was pleased to call the [...] "honor we had done him".|$|E
2500|$|While {{teaching}} Torah, Judah {{would often}} interrupt the lesson {{to recite the}} Shema Yisrael. He passed his hand over <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> said it. (Berachot 13b) ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{memories}} of Svetlana Aliluyeva, Chiaureli approached her father with the idea to combine the fate of his son, Yakov Dzhugashvili, in the plot. Stalin promptly rejected this. Soviet actor Artyom Karapetian claimed Chiaureli's wife, actress Veriko Anjaparidze, told him Stalin was so outraged when he heard of this that Lavrentiy Beria – who was standing nearby – [...] reached into his trousers' pocket, [...] "presumably, for his gun." [...] The director's daughter, Sofiko Chiaureli, recounted that her father [...] "knew he was saved" [...] when Stalin wiped tears from <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> watched Gelovani descend from the plane and muttered [...] "If only I had gone to Berlin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said old Mr. Salton, [...] "it {{is quite}} time you young people {{departed}} for that honeymoon of yours!" [...] There was {{a twinkle in}} <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "There are one or {{two things}} that I am not up to yet," [...] he answered, with a laugh {{in the corner of}} <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> waxed <b>his</b> thread with a flourish.|$|R
60|$|Apparently Cuffy was of {{the same}} opinion, for he did not wag even the point of his tail, and there was {{something}} dubious in the glance of <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> waited for more.|$|R
60|$|The Captain applied his {{binocular}} {{telescope to}} <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke.|$|E
60|$|Eustace could {{scarcely}} believe <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> looked where the boy pointed.|$|E
60|$|Draconmeyer {{tried hard}} to keep the light from <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> leaned towards her.|$|E
6000|$|... "One of Sankey's hymns," [...] {{said the}} sergeant, with the remotest {{semblance of a}} twinkle in <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> took a small hymn-book from under his pillow {{and gave it to}} his friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-by." [...] He {{still held}} her hand. Presently he drew {{her back into}} the room, closing the door carefully, and glancing around. There was a look of {{profound}} cunning in <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> said slowly,-- ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{no mistaking}} the sly leer which {{appeared}} in <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke. Lydie felt her cheeks flaming up with sudden wrath; wrath, which as quickly gave way to an awful, an unconquerable horror.|$|R
60|$|Damer flushed a little, {{and a look}} of vindictive malice {{crept into}} <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> rose.|$|E
60|$|Clarence protested with {{a visible}} {{pleasure}} in <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> held back a spray before the opening.|$|E
60|$|He checked her. The tears rose in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{drew her}} gently {{back into the}} room.|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} one trouble with the battery which did not reach <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> turned it around and started it up. That was that {{a portion of the}} {{insulation}} of a main wire was worn off.|$|R
6000|$|Another beefsteak to <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{sat in the}} drawing-room, a cold-water bandage, or {{any little}} medical {{appliance}} of that sort;--these were the things which Lady Amelia would, in her domestic good nature, condescend not to mind! ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{steadiness}} of his manner, and {{the intelligence}} of <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever other unpardonable folly might bring him to Cleveland, he was not brought there by intoxication, she said, after a moment's recollection, ...|$|R
60|$|Winston smiled, {{though there}} was a wistfulness in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> saw the faint bewilderment in his companions' faces.|$|E
60|$|Red Gallagher {{staggered}} to his feet. Already {{the horror}} of the murderer was in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> glanced furtively around.|$|E
60|$|David's teeth came together. There was {{lightning}} in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{glanced down}} through the trees towards Vont's little cottage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nice {{little thing}} she is too," [...] said the waterman, {{watching}} the other {{out of the}} corner of <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> bent to <b>his</b> oars. [...] "Rides the water like a duck. Her cap’n knows a thing or two, I’ll bet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come on, then; we'll {{feed the}} stock, and then I'll {{show you how}} to yoke oxen," [...] said Saul, with a twinkle in <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> led the way, when his new aide had muffled himself up as if for a polar voyage.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a little}} crowd round the smith's house, {{and in spite of}} his unmilitary predilections, he could not help feeling proud at the public {{testimony}} that was paid to his sons' merits: he showed this by the tear that stood in <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> said: ...|$|R
