Initial studies were conducted on Nomex Type 455 (polyamide) fabrics dyed to three commercial shades in both pilot scale and full scale in-plant experiments. Dyebaths have been used up to 15 times before being discharged. Color reproducibility, color uniformity, crockfastness and flammability of samples dyed by the reuse system were comparable to those achieved with conventional dyeing. Significant reductions in dye, chemical, water and energy requirements were achieved in the reuse dyeings. The capital cost for modification of a typical <b>jet</b> <b>dyeing</b> machine for reuse dyeing and for the required analytical instrumentation was $ 1 5, 000.

40|$|The present work {{examines}} {{and models}} physico-chemical aspects of dyeing processes of cotton fibre with a direct dye (C. l. Direct Yellow 162). The models and methods {{in this thesis}} were developed {{with the aim of}} providing analytical tools that could help to cut back dyeing process times compared to current standard industrial practice, to reduce the need for dye additions and re-works, and to diminish or eliminate the use of some types of auxiliary, such as levelling agents. Theoretical considerations revealed that three parameters appear to be central to the scaling of <b>jet</b> <b>dyeing</b> equipment: the liquor ratio, the number of fabric as well as of dyeliquor revolutions per minute and the dimensionless parameter L, which describes the influence of the tlow regime in the dyeing machine on the exhaustion kinetics. Experiments on the pilotscale <b>jet</b> <b>dyeing</b> machine showed that, under scaled-down industrial process conditions, the dye uptake rate was not affected by boundary layer effects. Several thermodynamic models were examined for their accuracy to predict the dye amount sorbed by the fibre under equilibrium conditions. Two versions of the Gouy-Chapman model and three models derived from the Donnan membrane equilibrium were evaluated. Best overall results were obtained with a GOlly-Chapman model using a variable fibre saturation molality for the dye. The average back-prediction error of this model for the dye on fibre amount was below two per cent. A newly developed model of the exhaustion kinetics of the dyeing process interprets the dye uptake rate as a combination of rapid dye adsorption at the fibre surface with slow diffusional dye transfer from the surface into the fibre interior. The model predicted the exhaustion values of isothermal experiments with an average accuracy of + 1 - 2. 3...|$|E

40|$|Recently we {{reported}} the first laser spectroscopic {{measurement of the}} transition frequency of the 58. 4 nm resonance line of 4 He, resulting in accurate values for the binding energy and the Lamb shift for its ground state. In contrast to the extensively investigated hydrogen atom, the Lamb shift in helium also contains a two-electron contribution. This shift is {{an order of magnitude}} larger in the ground state than in excited states of He. Accurate calculations show that the two-electron shift contributes - 0. 1404 cm- 1 to a total Lamb shift of + 1. 3745 cm- 1. The ground state Lamb shift was first measured by Herzberg in 1958 with an accuracy of 0. 15 cm- 1. The main experimental difficulty to improve this accuracy lies in the generation of tunable and narrowband extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation at 58. 4 nm required to excite the 11 S- 21 P transition. Until recently the shortest wavelength produced with nanosecond pulsed lasers in combination with harmonic conversion techniques was 66 nm. We succeeded in the generation of narrow bandwidth (0. 3 cm- 1) XUV radiation at 58. 4 nm by fifth-harmonic conversion of UV-light (30 - 40 mJ in 5 ns) from a frequency-doubled pulsed dye laser at 584 nm in a pulsed acetylene <b>jet.</b> The <b>dye</b> laser is pumped by an injection seeded Nd:YAG laser. It is estimated that on the order of 105 photons per laser pulse are generated. The XUV beam perpendicularly intersects a pulsed beam of He seeded in Kr to reduce Doppler effects. The helium atoms are excited by the XUV light and subsequently ionized with the UV light, that spatially and temporally overlaps the XUV beam. Ion-detection is performed after a mass-selecting time-of-flight region with an electron multiplier and a boxcar integrator. A recorded spectrum of the resonance line of 4 He at 58. 4 nm is shown in Fig. 1. A simultaneously recorded I 2 -absorption spectrum at the fundamental wavelength (584 nm) is shown as well. This spectrum is used for the calibration. The etalon transmission fringes are employed for linearization of the wavelength scan. The obtained transition frequency for 4 He is 171134. 89 ± 0. 03 cm- 1. From this a Lamb shift for the ground state of + 1. 38 cm- 1 is extracted, in good agreement with the theoretical value of 1. 3745 cm- 1. A measurement of the transition frequency of 3 He will be performed as well. Results will be presented at the conference. Moreover work is in progress to reduce the linewidth of the XUV radiation. For this purpose the pulsed dye laser will be replaced by an injection seeded optical parametric oscillator with a nearly Fourier-transform limited output. We expect to reduce the present error limit of 0. 03 cm- 1 by at least an order of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} studies {{were made on}} two classes of buoyant jet problems, namely: 1) an inclined, round buoyant jet in a stagnant environment with linear density-stratification; 2) a round buoyant jet in a uniform cross stream of homogeneous density. Using the integral technique of analysis, assuming similarity, predictions can be made for, jet trajectory, widths, and dilution ratios, in a density-stratified or flowing environment. Such information is of great importance {{in the design of}} disposal systems for sewage effluent into the ocean or waste gases into the atmosphere. The present study of a buoyant jet in a stagnant environment has extended the Morton type of analysis to cover the effect of the initial angle of discharge. Numerical solutions have been presented for a range of initial conditions. Laboratory experiments were conducted for photographic observations of the trajectories of <b>dyed</b> <b>jets.</b> In general the observed jet forms agreed well with the calculated trajectories and nominal half widths when the value of the entrainment coefficient was taken to be α = 0. 082, as previously suggested by Morton. The problem of a buoyant jet in a uniform cross stream was analyzed by assuming an entrainment mechanism based upon the vector difference between the characteristic jet velocity and the ambient velocity. The effect of the unbalanced pressure field {{on the sides of the}} jet flow was approximated by a gross drag term. Laboratory flume experiments with sinking jets which are directly analogous to buoyant jets were performed. Salt solutions were injected into fresh water at the free surface in a flume. The jet trajectories, dilution ratios and jet half widths were determined by conductivity measurements. The entrainment coefficient, α, and drag coefficient, Cd, were found from the observed jet trajectories and dilution ratios. In the ten cases studied where jet Froude number ranged from 10 to 80 and velocity ratio (jet: current) k from 4 to 16, a varied from 0. 4 to 0. 5 and Cd from 1. 7 to 0. 1. The jet mixing motion for distances within 250 D was found to be dominated by the self-generated turbulence, rather than the free-stream turbulence. Similarity of concentration profiles has also been discussed...|$|R
40|$|Differential {{diffusion}} in {{a turbulent}} jet was investigated experimentally. The two primary objectives {{associated with this}} work were to systematically study: (i) the Reynolds number dependence, and (ii) the radial distribution of differential diffusion in the jet. These goals were simultaneously achieved, along with several secondary objectives, such as determining the scales at which differential diffusion is manifested and examining the effect of background turbulence on differential diffusion. Experiments were performed in a momentum-driven, axisymmetric turbulent water jet, containing two passive scalars (fluorescent dyes) with differing molecular diffusivities (D). The jet issued into either a quiescent background or an approximately homogeneous, isotropic turbulent background. To determine the Reynolds number dependence, tests were conducted at five jet Reynolds numbers, ranging from Re = 900 to Re = 10600. (Re = u 0 d/v, where u 0 is the jet exit velocity, d is the jet exit diameter, and v is the kinematic viscosity.) Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) was employed to obtain instantaneous individual species concentrations at a downstream location, located in the self-similar region. At each Reynolds number, measurements were acquired at radial positions extending from the jet centreline to its edges. The normalized concentration difference, Z, was defined to elucidate differential diffusion effects. Statistics of this parameter revealed the magnitude of differential diffusion at each Reynolds number and radial location. In particular, the root-mean square of the normalized concentration difference, Z rms, gave {{an indication of the}} intensity of these effects. Centreline results showed that differential diffusion effects slowly decay with increasing Reynolds number, scaling as Zrms ∝ Re- 0. 09. Even though the effects were decreasing, they were still non-zero at the highest Reynolds number studied (Zrms = 0. 064 at the centreline at Re = 10600). Differential diffusion effects were also shown to increase (i) with increased radial position from the centreline, and (ii) {{in the presence of a}} turbulent background. These two instances, along with the increased differential diffusion at lower Reynolds numbers, support the hypothesis of an increase of differential diffusion effects as the occurrences of interfaces between <b>dyed</b> <b>jet</b> fluid and entrained ambient fluid increases. Also presented are the first experimental measurements of the spectrum of the normalized concentration difference, EZ(K 1 eta). These revealed the scales at which differential diffusion manifests itself. In all instances, these spectra were observed to decrease with wavenumber over all wavenumbers, consistent with a flow dominated by the decay of its scalar field. Although differential diffusion effects are molecular in origin, they persist at scales larger than the Kolmogorov scale...|$|R
