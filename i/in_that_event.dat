5|$|When Edward {{found out}} about Harclay's treason, he issued an order for the earl's arrest.

Lucy, who acted with only a small force, was clearly trusted by Harclay, so the arrest must have been conducted as a surprise manoeuvre. The enmity between Lucy and Harclay could stem from a dispute over the honour of Papcastle. In 1322, Harclay had also briefly disseised Lucy of his lands after the 1322 rebellion, even though Lucy had taken no part <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>event.</b>|$|E
