40|$|This paper appraises {{the efforts}} of {{official}} creditors to help <b>highly</b> indebted <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> escape the vicious cycle of debt unsustainability. It examines three major models through which <b>highly</b> indebted <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> were assisted to achieve debt sustainability, namely; the Baker Plan, the Brady Plan and the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. In spite of the huge monetary costs incurred to run these programmes, debt sustainability {{continues to be a}} major challenge for most of the economies that benefitted from debt relief. The example of Ghana, a beneficiary of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative is highlighted to support the general evidence from literature. <b>Highly</b> indebted <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> certainly need more than debt relief, and it is probably becoming clearer that money {{may not be the most}} important need of developing economies...|$|R
25|$|Medical tourism {{refers to}} people {{traveling}} {{to a country}} {{other than their own}} to obtain medical treatment. In the past this usually referred to those who traveled from less-developed countries to major medical centers in <b>highly</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> for treatment unavailable at home. However, in recent years it may equally refer to those from developed countries who travel to developing countries for lower priced medical treatments. The motivation may be also for medical services unavailable or illegal in the home country.|$|E

In developing countries, particularly those that are sub-tropical or tropical such as India, the per person energy use rate is closer to 0.7kW. Bangladesh has the lowest consumption rate with 0.2kW per person.|$|E

Mexico's medical infrastructure is highly rated for the most part and is usually excellent in major cities, but rural communities still lack equipment for advanced medical procedures, forcing patients in those locations to travel to the closest urban areas to get specialized medical care. [...] Social determinants of health can be used to evaluate the state of health in Mexico.|$|E
30|$|Looking {{closely at}} the figure, we see that, among the Confucian countries, {{democracy}} is valued highest among the Chinese and lowest among the Japanese. We might have expected a reverse relationship, since China is still communist, while Japan has been a democracy since 1945 and is a <b>highly</b> <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> in terms of industrial structure and education. However, notably, the notions of democracy vary between countries, since democracy is also embedded in each culture.|$|R

2500|$|South Korea {{is one of}} the world's most <b>highly</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> and {{including}} it with developing countries like the BRICs is not deemed correct. However, commentators such as William Pesek from Bloomberg argue that Korea is [...] "Another 'BRIC' in Global Wall", suggesting that it stands out from the Next Eleven economies with its BRIC-like growth rate, despite its Human Development Index being higher than some of the world's most advanced economies, including France, UK, Austria, Denmark, Finland and Belgium. South Korean workers are the wealthiest among major Asian countries, with a higher income than Japan and the strongest growth rate in the OECD. More importantly, it has a significantly higher Growth Environment Score (Goldman Sachs' way of measuring the long-term sustainability of growth) than all of the BRICs or N-11s. According to the IMF, South Korea's GDP measured by purchasing power parity is already larger than Canada and Spain. In terms of GDP per capita (PPP), South Korea overtook Spain in 2010. According to Citibank, South Korea will continue by overtaking Germany, Britain, Australia and Sweden by 2020, surpassing Canada, Switzerland, Netherlands and Norway by 2030 and taking over the United States by 2040 to become the world's wealthiest major economy. While measuring the South Korean economy by nominal GDP is inaccurate as the South Korean won is artificially kept low to boost exports, IMF predicts South Korea's nominal GDP and GDP per capita will surpass Spain in 2015. Economists from other investment firms argue that even when measured by nominal GDP per capita, South Korea will achieve over $145,000 in 2040, surpassing the United States, suggesting that wealth is more important than size for bond investors, stating that Korea's credit rating will be rated AAA sooner than 2050.|$|E

30|$|For Japan, {{which is}} a {{consolidated}} democracy and a <b>highly</b> <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> in terms of industry and education, we see no significant correlation between education and the preference for self-expression values and support for democracy.

This form of education stands {{in sharp contrast to}} the Western ideal of reflexive scrutinizing. However, since the survey in Japan dates from 2010, it would be interesting to see whether the Fukushima atomic disaster has led to a process of awareness in the direction of more reflexive scrutinizing.|$|R
