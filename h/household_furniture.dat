Didius Julianus outbid everyone else for the price of 6,250 drachmas per guard, an act that initiated a brief civil war.

25|$|Benvenuto Cellini worked {{almost ten}} years on this bronze (1545-1554). His wax design was {{immediately}} approved by Cosimo I de' Medici. He met numerous difficulties which, according to his autobiography, almost {{brought him to the}} brink of death. The casting of this bronze statue was several times unsuccessful. When attempting again, the melting furnace got overheated, spoiling the casting of the bronze. Cellini gave orders to feed the furnace with his <b>household</b> <b>furniture</b> and finally with about 200 pewter dishes and plates, and his pots and pans. This caused the bronze to flow again. After the bronze had cooled, the statue was finished, except for three toes on the right foot. These were added later.|$|E
25|$|Factories {{were needed}} to produce {{affordable}} wooden <b>household</b> <b>furniture</b> for the southern market. The first furniture company, the High Point Furniture Manufacturing Company, was formed in 1889. Subsequently, from 1890-1900, 38 new furniture factories opened in the state, with 13 of those in High Point. The Southern Railway line was formed in 1894, and High Point was shipping eight fully loaded freight cars of furniture each day by 1898. By {{the turn of the}} century, High Point had become the leading furniture center in the South, with over 40 furniture companies located within the city and the surrounding area. Meanwhile, other manufacturers set up local factories to provide related products like veneers, plate glass, mirrors, paint, and locks to furniture companies.|$|E
25|$|Relief (keurmede): Usually {{the lord}} was {{entitled}} to levy a relief duty or heriot which was sometimes referred to in Dutch as the recht van de dode hand, or ‘dead hand right’. This was an inheritance tax on a deceased tenant’s estate that granted the privilege to an heir to succeed to the deceased’s estate. The amount was usually {{in the order of}} 5% {{of the value of the}} real property. Sometimes the lord also had the right to take the deceased’s best chattel (beste kateil/katell). Depending on the region, this was also referred to as the ‘best beast’ (beste hoofd), referring to the best animal in the herd, or the ‘high chair’ (hoogstoel), meaning the nicest piece of <b>household</b> <b>furniture.</b> Often there was also a special relief for the estate of a ‘foreigner’ (inwijkeling), that is, someone not born in the heerlijkheid, and illegitimate children.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the reasons}} kings of the period were so often adverse to pitched battles {{was the fact that}} they {{travelled}} as an itinerant government and nomadic treasury, which were too valuable to lose on the battlefield. And since kings of this period often travelled as peripatetic courts, Philip's baggage train contained not just personal effects, such as <b>household</b> <b>furniture</b> but the necessary paraphernalia for government and tax collecting. Among the French king's luggage, captured by the English, were his personal seal, and important archival documents such as financial records, domanial charters, payment inventories, and rent and toll receipts. Also captured was a great quantity of treasure, 'whose value was immense,' said one French chronicler. Philip beat a hasty retreat across the River Epte, and in doing so, the bridge collapsed {{under the weight of the}} retreating army. This apparently resulted in the French king getting soaked through, which one writer has described as 'a condition which delighted Richard.' [...] The English King may have come 'within minutes' of capturing Philip, but, being overly-enthusiastic in his attempt to capture Philip, rode a great distance past the chapel where Philip was actually hiding, allowing him to escape.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{indication}} that Hathaway {{may have been}} financially secure in her own right. The National Archives states that [...] "beds and other pieces of <b>household</b> <b>furniture</b> were often the sole bequest to a wife" [...] and that, customarily, the children would receive the best items and the widow the second-best. In Shakespeare's time, the beds of prosperous citizens were expensive affairs, sometimes equivalent in value to a small house. The bequest was thus not as minor {{as it might seem}} in modern times. In Elizabethan custom the best bed in the house was reserved for guests. If so, then the bed that Shakespeare bequeathed to Anne could have been their marital bed, and thus not intended to insult her.|$|E

2500|$|The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 had ceded Acadia to England, {{but without}} specifying where the {{boundary}} was between Acadia and {{what remained of}} New France. This led to ongoing skirmishes until June 1755 when, {{as part of a}} wider struggle of the British and French of North American colonies, the French were defeated at the Battle of Beausejour. This led to the removal of most of the French military from Acadia. Six weeks later, Governor Charles Lawrence, without distinguishing between neutral Acadians and those who had resisted the British, wrote that the Acadians [...] "shall be removed out of the country as soon as possible, and as to those about the isthmus who were in arms and therefore entitled to no favour from the government it is determined to begin with them first".

2500|$|The {{furniture}} industry and developing textile manufacturing {{set the pace}} for two 20th century growth booms in High Point. Over {{the decade of the}} 1920s, the population grew from 14,302 to 36,745 as $20 million of building permits were issued and $26 million was spent on city improvements. The Great Depression did not seem to affect the southern furniture market which produced trendy and affordable furnishings as much as those in the North that produced traditional, luxurious products. Rebounding by 1935, North Carolina was second only to New York in US furniture production. Meanwhile, the High Point Market continued to set furniture trends and to be a national economic indicator; the $5 billion in sales in 1947 after World War II forecast a postwar boom. The 1950s' growth of the furniture market mirrored that of High Point's second population boom from 39,973 in 1950 to 62,063 in 1960. By 1959, North Carolina had become the state employing the most {{number of people in the}} {{furniture industry}}, beating out New York. In 1961, The State magazine declared that [...] "High Point, in Guilford County, is the world's leading manufacturing center of wood furniture. It is also the location of one of the nation's principal furniture markets." [...] Four international furniture shows were being hosted by High Point at that time, including the High Point Market (still known then as the Southern Furniture Exposition), which The State reported was drawing crowds of five to six thousand buyers. Throughout the end of the 20th century, North Carolina continued to lead the nation in the production of both upholstered and wooden <b>household</b> <b>furniture.</b> The furniture was slightly styled and inexpensive, to meet the needs of all income levels, but lost its regional characteristics. Some local artisans still maintained a unique and high quality wooden product. High Point became known as the [...] "Furniture Capital of the World" [...] in the 1980s during the golden era of North Carolina furniture manufacturing.|$|E
