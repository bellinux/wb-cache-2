For this, a structured questionnaire was developed to investigate operational characteristics and basic data on <b>dairy</b> <b>goat</b> husbandry and breeding. The addresses of commercial <b>dairy</b> <b>goat</b> farms where ob-tained from goat breeders associations. The feedback from goat farmers was very high (94 %). Most <b>dairy</b> <b>goat</b> farms are organic farms and belong to specific certifying organisations. Most farms (87 %) farm less than 50 ha of agricultural land and keep between 60 and 100 goats. The German Fawn is the predominant breed (80 %) in female goats. There is a large variation in numbers of male goats per farm and also in their breed. The marketing of surplus kids is mainly directly to the consumer and below 12 weeks of age. Finally, commercial <b>dairy</b> <b>goat</b> farming in south Germany secures an income to small family farms. So far, there is no consistent breeding strat-egy.

A survey of <b>dairy</b> <b>goat</b> farms in and around Pretoria carried out by means of a questionnaire revealed that most of the smallholder <b>dairy</b> <b>goat</b> farms surveyed used an extensive type of production system. The method of milking varied with the type of production system, i. e. machine milking; bucket system machine milking and hand-milking, respectively. Udder half milk samples (n= 270) were analysed, of which 31. 1 % were infected with bacteria. The lowest intra-mammary infection was found amongst goats in the herd under the extensive system (13. 3 %), compared with 43. 3 % and 36. 7 % infection rates under the intensive and semi-intensive production systems, respectively. Staphylococcus intermedius (coagulase positive), Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus simulans (both coagulase negative), were {{the most common cause of}} intramammary infection with a prevalence of 85. 7 % of the infected udder halves. The remaining 14. 3 % of the infection was due to Staphylococcus aureus. Bacteriology of bulk milk samples on the other hand, showed that raw milk obtained by the bucket system milking machine had the lowest total bacterial count (16 450 colony forming units (CFU) /mℓ) compared to that by pipeline milking machine (36 300 CFU/mℓ) or handmilking (48 000 CFU/mℓ). No significant relationship was found between the somatic cell counts (SCC) and presence of bacterial infection in goat milk.
