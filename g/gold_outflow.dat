This state of affairs lasted until the Great Depression (1929-1939) forced countries off the gold standard. In September 19, 1931, speculative attacks on the pound forced Britain to abandon the gold standard. Loans from American and French Central Banks of £50,000,000 were insufficient and exhausted in a matter of weeks, due to large <b>gold</b> <b>outflows</b> across the Atlantic. The British benefited from this departure. They could now use monetary policy to stimulate the economy. Australia and New Zealand had already left the standard and Canada quickly followed suit.|$|R

25|$|By 1968, {{the attempt}} to defend the dollar at a fixed peg of $35/ounce, {{the policy of the}} Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson administrations, had become {{increasingly}} untenable. <b>Gold</b> <b>outflows</b> from the U.S. accelerated, and despite gaining assurances from Germany and other nations to hold gold, the unbalanced fiscal spending of the Johnson administration had transformed the dollar shortage of the 1940s and 1950s into a dollar glut by the 1960s. In 1967, the IMF agreed in Rio de Janeiro to replace the tranche division set up in 1946. Special drawing rights (SDRs) were set as equal to one U.S. dollar, but were not usable for transactions other than between banks and the IMF. Nations were required to accept holding SDRs equal to three times their allotment, and interest would be charged, or credited, to each nation based on their SDR holding.

In fact, the worst period of 1932 – the Great Depression had passed, but the recovery was slow and weak. During the financial crisis of 1933 that culminated in the banking holiday in March 1933, a lot of gold flowed out from the Fed, some of them flow out to individuals and companies in the United States.

In the spring and summer of 1933, the Roosevelt government suspended the gold standard. The Emergency Banking Act gave the President the power to control international and domestic gold sports. It also gave the treasury secretary the power to surrender of gold coins and certificates. On April 20, President Roosevelt issued a formal announcement of the moratorium on the gold standard. The announcement prohibited gold exports, and prohibited financial institutions from converting money and deposits into gold coins and ingots. The action prevented the <b>gold</b> <b>outflow.</b> Soon, the Roosevelt government weakened the connection with gold once again.

The President Roosevelt also used the silver standard instead of gold to exchange dollars, it determined by the price of the bank. In April 1933, Roosevelt decided to abolish the gold standard through the New Deal. He abandoned this traditional monetary policy is mainly due to the big crisis to the original monetary policy failure.

Countries imposing capital controls also appear to perform similar to the gold bloc countries once the latter group of countries finally abandoned gold. Time series regressions further demonstrate that countries imposing capital controls refrained from fully utilizing their newly acquired monetary policy autonomy. Even so, capital controls remained in place as instruments for manipulating trade flows and for preserving foreign exchange for the repayment of external debt. ...|$|R

50|$|Gerard de Malynes (1586-1641), another bullionist, {{published}} a book called A Treatise of the Canker of England's Common Wealth, in which he asserted that the exchange of foreign currency had been a trade of value rather than exchanging the weight of metals.

40|$|Views {{expressed}} do {{not necessarily}} reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve’s actions to support financial marketsand the broader economy have resulted in a large increasein bank reserves—both total reserves and reserves held in excess of legal requirements—since September 2008. 1 Excess reserves have risen from an average of less than 5 percent of total reserves during the 5 years ending in August 2008 to more than 90 percent since November 2008. Many observers contend that the large increase in excess reserves poses a significant inflation risk. A look back at a similar episode during the 1930 s provides some insights about how not to reduce excess reserves. As in the current situation, excess reserves grew rapidly and became a high percentage of total reserves during the mid- 1930 s. Depositor runs on banks and <b>gold</b> <b>outflows</b> caused reserves to contract sharply between 1929 and early 1933; subsequently, reserves began to grow in 1933 with the introduction of federal deposit insurance.

40|$|This work explores how Argentina {{overcame the}} Great Depression and asks whether active {{macroeconomic}} interventions made any {{contribution to the}} recovery. In particular, we study Argentine macroeconomic policy as it deviated from gold-standard orthodoxy after the final suspension of convertibility in 1929. As elsewhere, fiscal policy in Argentina was conservative, and had little power to smooth output. Monetary policy became heterodox after 1929. The {{first and most important}} stage of institutional change took place with the switch from a metallic monetary regime to a fiduciary regime in 1931; the Caja de Conversi¢n (Conversion Office, a currency board) began rediscounting as a means to sterilize <b>gold</b> <b>outflows</b> and avoid deflationary pressures, thus breaking from orthodox game. and were not enough to fully offset the incipient monetary contractions: the recovery derived from changes in beliefs and expectations surrounding the shift in the monetary and exchange-rate regime, and the delinking of gold flows and the money base. Agents perceived a new regime, as shown by the path of consumption, investment, and estimated ex ante real interest rates: the predated a later, and supposedly more significant, stage of institutional reform, namely the creation of the central bank in 1935. Still, the extent of intervention was weak, and insufficient to fully offset external shocks to prices and money. Argentine macropolicy was heterodox in terms of the change of regime, but still conservative in terms of the tentative scope of the measures taken. ...|$|R
40|$|At a {{distance}} of nearly two centuries since it broke out, the Bullion Controversy is still an endless source of questions and interpretations. The most recent contributions to the debate have focussed mainly on two points. The first is the position taken by one of most eminent participants in the controversy, David Ricardo. The second is the microeconomics of precious metals flows and {{the workings of the}} connected markets: the market for bills of exchange and the market for gold. Here attention has shifted from the question “Why?” (real vs. monetary causes of gold flows) to the question “How?” (which markets move first? Which are the signals that prompt the behaviour of the agents?). Following this trend, a recent interpretation of Ricardo’s monetary theory (De Boyer in this volume and 2007) claims that Ricardo rejected the “gold points” mechanism that Thornton had suggested and was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for <b>gold</b> <b>outflows.</b> In this note I will argue, instead, that Ricardo, like Thornton, Malthus and most {{of the participants in the}} controversy aligned in the Bullionist camp, was well aware of the mechanics of gold movements and, indeed, based his theory on it. However, De Boyer is right in pointing out that there are some obscurities in Ricardo’s writings regarding the role played by commodity prices in variations in the rate of exchange and in the transmission mechanism of an ‘overissue’. The fact that Ricardo dwelt little on this issue, may have been due to the consideration that it was common ground and required no further clarification, or even to sheer lack of interest, his main focus being the value of the currency, measured by its purchasing power over gold, and not the dynamics of international trade...|$|R
40|$|THE {{events of}} the past few years have alerted economists and non-economists alike to the {{difficulty}} of choosing appropriate monetary policies while making the implicit assumption that the economy is closed. The problems posed for policy-makers by the existence of a deficit in the balance of payments and a continued <b>gold</b> <b>outflow</b> are familiar enough. Indeed, the balance-of-payments deficit and the <b>gold</b> <b>outflow</b> have received so much recent attention that it is perhaps time to recall that there are also dangers in ignoring or minimizing certain domestic effects of monetary policy. The dangers result from the tendency to equate monetary policy with its effect upon interest rates and its effects on gold outflows and balance-of-payments deficits through interest rates. My conclusion that the domestic effects of changes in money are often ignored is based on several sources. Some of these are familiar; for example, the analysis that was widely used to support the 1964 tax cut in the United States, and recent governmental policy statements suggesting that monetary policy be used for balance-of-payments purposes, while fiscal policy be used to stimulate the domestic economy. More disturbing are the indications of a possible change in current monetary policy that is reflected in a reduced growth rate of the money supply. Enticing as it is to speculate about the present direction of policy, it is probably more fruitful to discuss the rationale used to justify the policy actions of the last few years...|$|E
40|$|Between 1958 and 1968, {{the primary}} {{objective}} of U. S. foreign economic policy {{was to find a}} way to control the American balance of payments deficit and stem the loss of gold from the American Treasury. Many of the policies which were enacted or considered in order to solve the payments problem and ease the gold drain conflicted with the larger goals of American foreign policy and domestic economic policy. This clash created enormous tensions within both the U. S. government and the Western Alliance, and impacted a whole range of policies, from American troop deployments overseas to American investment in Europe. Despite these political tensions, American policy-makers feared an economic catastrophe if the balance of payments deficit was not reduced and the <b>gold</b> <b>outflow</b> ended. Many policy-makers, correctly or not, drew parallels with the international monetary conditions of the 19302 ̆ 7 s, and feared that a failure to correct the problem could unleash an international economic collapse and political disaster. ^ Three successive administrations were obsessed with trying to end the U. S payments imbalance and <b>gold</b> <b>outflow</b> without jeopardizing America 2 ̆ 7 s vast political and military commitments around the world. Each administration produced controversial programs to limit or end the deficit, all to no avail.

Yet despite the obvious importance of this subject, there has never been a full-scale diplomatic or economic history of the attempt by American policy-makers to understand and solve the vexing problem of the balance of payments deficit.

The absence of an operational central bank encouraged Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo to improvise the modern principle of aiming an independent weapon at each policy target. He employed a form of capital controls to deal with the external threat, shutting the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for more than four months to prevent Europeans from selling their American securities and demanding gold in return.

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{has that}} {{peripheral}} economies had to `play {{by the rules}} of the game` under the Classical Gold Standard (1870 s- 1914), while core countries could get away with frequent violations. Drawing on the experience of three core economies (England, France, Germany) and seven peripheral economies (Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Norway, Serbia, Sweden), my paper argues for a more nuanced perspective on the European periphery. While the conventional view might be true for some countries - most notably the Balkan countries - our findings, based on a VAR model and impulse response functions, suggest that the average gold drain that a specific peripheral economy was exposed to differed substantially from country to country. We also show that some of the peripheral economies, most notably Austria-Hungary, always enjoyed enough pulling power via discount rate policy to reverse quickly any such <b>gold</b> <b>outflow.</b> In sum, while the experience of some peripheral economies under gold was poor and hence normally short-lived, the experience of other peripheral countries resembled more those of the core economies. ...|$|E

The biggest <b>gold</b> <b>outflow</b> in a generation imperiled America's ability to repay its debts abroad. Fear that the United States would abandon the gold standard sent the dollar plummeting on world markets.

He shut the New York Stock Exchange for more than four months to prevent Europeans from selling their American securities and demanding gold in return. He smothered the country with emergency currency to prevent a replay of the bank runs that swept America in 1907. And he launched the United States as a world monetary power by honoring America's commitment to the gold standard. His actions provide a blueprint for crisis control that merits attention today. McAdoo's recipe emphasizes an exit strategy that allows policymakers to throttle a crisis while minimizing collateral damage. When Washington Shut Down Wall Street recreates the drama of America's battle for financial credibility. McAdoo's accomplishments place him alongside Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan as great American financial leaders.
