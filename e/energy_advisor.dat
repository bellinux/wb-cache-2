2500|$|Romney's {{energy plan}} that was {{unveiled}} in August 2012 would maintain subsidies for oil companies, which Romney's rival for the presidency, Obama, would eliminate. During the 2008 presidential campaign, in November 2007 {{when all of}} the Democratic presidential candidates were calling for eliminating billions of dollars of tax breaks for oil companies, Romney told the New York Times, [...] "Now is not the right time to raise taxes on our oil companies." [...] Throughout most of the 2012 presidential campaign, Romney himself made almost no public statements directly commenting on tax breaks for oil and gas companies; and the Romney campaign declined to respond to repeated requests from the Tampa Bay Times Politifact and The Washington Post's Fact Checker to clarify his position. However, he did tell a town hall gathering in April 2012 that, in contrast to Obama, {{he did not want to}} raise taxes on oil companies. Romney's chief <b>energy</b> <b>advisor</b> also testified before Congress twice during the campaign on behalf of the oil and gas industry that Congress should maintain tax benefits for oil and gas producers. During the first presidential debate between Romney and Obama, in October 2012, Romney hinted for the first time that as president he might consider eliminating $2.8 billion in tax breaks for oil and gas producers if Congress would agree to cut the tax rate for all corporations by 30%.|$|E

In addition to documenting how the system was appropriated in advisory work, we elaborate the ‘overhead cost’ of building collaborative action into connected devices and sensing systems, and the commensurate need to support discrete workflows and accountability systems to enable the methodical incorporation of the IoT into collaborative action.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present how, using a {{visualization}} method, electricity use can be derived from the everyday activity patterns of household members. Target groups are, on the one hand, professionals in the energy sector and <b>energy</b> <b>advisors</b> who need more knowledge about household energy use, and, on the other hand, household members wanting to reduce the energy use by revealing their own habits and thereby finding out how changed activity performance may influence electricity use. The focus is on the relation between utilizing electric appliances to perform everyday life activities and the use of electricity. The visualization method is based on the time-geographic approach developed by Hägerstrand and includes a model that estimates appliance electricity use from household members’ activities. Focus, in this paper, is put on some basic activities performed to satisfy daily life needs: cooking and use of information, communication and entertainment devices. These activities appear frequently in the everyday life of households, even though not all household members perform them all. The method is applied on a data material comprising time-diaries written by 463 individuals (aged 10 to 85 +) in 179 households in different parts of Sweden. The visualization method reveals when and for how long activities that claim electric appliances are performed by which individual(s). It also shows electricity load curves generated from the use of appliances at different levels, such as individual, household and group or population levels. At household level the method can reveal which household members are the main users of electricity, i. e. the division of labour between household members. Thereby it also informs about whom could be approached by energy companies and <b>energy</b> <b>advisors</b> in information campaigns. The main result of the study is that systematic differences in activity patterns in subgroups of a population can be identified (e. g. men and women) but that directed information based on these patterns has to be made with care and with the risk of making too broad generalizations...|$|R
40|$|Purpose / Context – Energy {{efficiency}} measures/ private home-owners/ {{decision process}} Methodology / Approach –Explorative research/ qualitative interviews/ content analysis Results – Decisions towards energetic renovation measures {{can be characterized}} as a strategic consumer decision rather than the often assumed purely investment decision. Emotionally shaped motives seem to displace rational determinants such as financial savings and amortization. Key Findings / Implications – The argumentation should focus more specifically on the advantages of the measures that are non-financial. This primarily includes the improvement of the indoor climate and the accentuated well-being that goes with it hand in hand. To sustainably activate potential renovators the supply of out-reach consulting through <b>energy</b> <b>advisors</b> and local craftsmen should be enforced. Originality – The study makes an attempt to reconsider the decision-making process from the per-spective of consumer research in order to understand home-owners reluctance to conduct energy efficiency measures to their homes...|$|R

Romney's proposal, which was launched the same week as two industry fundraisers netted $10 million for the campaign, was seen as going beyond roots in the Sagebrush Rebellion of the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the sometimes controversial permitting policies of the George W.
