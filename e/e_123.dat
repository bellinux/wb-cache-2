40|$|AbstractFemtosecond time-resolved {{absorption}} {{measurements were}} performed to investigate {{the influence of the}} pH, imidazole concentration, and point mutations on the isomerization process of Channelrhodopsin- 2. Apart from the typical spectral characteristics of retinal isomerization, an additional absorption feature rises for the wild-type (wt) on a timescale from tens of ps to 1  ns within the spectral range of the photoproduct and is attributed to an equilibration between different K-intermediates. Remarkably, this absorption feature vanishes upon addition of imidazole or lowering the pH. In the latter case, the isomerization is dramatically slowed down, due to protonation of negatively charged amino acids within the retinal binding pocket, e. g., <b>E</b> <b>123</b> and D 253. Moreover, we investigated the influence of several point mutations within the retinal binding pocket <b>E</b> <b>123</b> T, <b>E</b> <b>123</b> D, C 128 T, and D 156 C. For <b>E</b> <b>123</b> T, the isomerization is retarded compared to wt and <b>E</b> <b>123</b> D, indicating that a negatively charged residue at this position functions as an effective catalyst in the isomerization process. In the case of the C 128 T mutant, all primary processes are slightly accelerated compared to the wt, whereas the isomerization dynamics for the D 156 C mutant is similar to wt after addition of imidazole...|$|E

40|$|Epidermal {{growth factor}} (EGF) -like modules are defined {{in part by}} six cysteines joined by disulfides in a 1 – 3, 2 – 4, and 5 – 6 pattern. Thrombospondin- 1 (TSP- 1) is a multimodular {{glycoprotein}} with three EGF-like modules, E 1, E 2, and E 3, arranged in tandem. These modules likely propagate conformational changes between surrounding C-terminal and N-terminal elements of TSP- 1 and interact with other extracellular molecules. E 1, E 2, and their homologs in other TSPs are unique among EGF-like modules in having two residues rather than one between Cys- 4 and Cys- 5. In addition, E 2 has a calcium-binding site and an unusually long loop between Cys- 5 and Cys- 6. The structure of E 1, E 2, or E 3 expressed alone changed little upon heating as monitored by far-UV CD, whereas more marked changes occurred in E 12, E 23, and <b>E</b> <b>123</b> tandem constructs.

40|$|Channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2) {{has become}} an {{indispensable}} tool in neuroscience, allowing precise induction of action potentials with short light pulses. A limiting factor for many optophysiological experiments is the relatively small photocurrent induced by ChR 2. We screened {{a large number of}} ChR 2 point mutants and discovered a dramatic increase in photocurrent amplitude after threonine-to-cysteine substitution at position 159. When we tested the T 159 C mutant in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, action potentials could be induced at very low light intensities, where currently available channelrhodopsins were unable to drive spiking. Biophysical characterization revealed that the kinetics of most ChR 2 variants slows down considerably at depolarized membrane potentials. We show that the recently published <b>E</b> <b>123</b> T substitution abolishes this voltage sensitivity and speeds up channel kinetics. When we combined T 159 C with <b>E</b> <b>123</b> T, the resulting double mutant delivered fast photocurrents with large amplitudes and increased the precision of single action potential induction over a broad range of frequencies, suggesting it may become the standard for light-controlled activation of neurons...|$|E

40|$|Canavan {{disease is}} {{inherited}} as an autosomal recessive trait that {{is caused by}} the deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA). The majority of patients with Canavan disease are from an Ashkenazi Jewish background. Mutations in ASPA that lead to loss of enzymatic activity have been identified, and E 285 A and Y 231 X are the two predominant mutations that account for 97 % of the mutant chromosomes in Ashkenazi Jewish patients. The current study was aimed at finding the molecular basis of Canavan disease in 25 independent patients of non-Jewish background. Eight novel and three previously characterized mutations accounted for 80 % (40 / 50) of mutant chromosomes. The A 305 E missense mutation accounted for 48 % (24 / 50) of mutant chromosomes in patients of western European descent, while the two predominant Jewish mutations each accounted for a single mutant chromosome. The eight novel mutations identified included 1 - and 4 -bp deletions (32 deltaT and 876 deltaAGAA, respectively) and I 16 T, G 27 R, D 114 <b>E,</b> G <b>123</b> <b>E,</b> C 152 Y, and R 168 C missense mutations.

40|$|Recently, Gunyadin et al. [1] {{designed}} and validated an engineered mutant of channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2) labeled <b>E</b> <b>123</b> T to accelerate channel kinetics of ChR 2 light gated ion channels. They reported a monoexponential decay for <b>E</b> <b>123</b> T photocurrent after {{the light is}} turned off. This {{is in contrast to}} the photocurrent characteristics of the wild type ChR 2, which not only exhibits slower channel kinetics, but the decay after the light is turned off is bi-exponential. In earlier work, Nikolic et al. [2] had captured the bi-exponential decay of wild type ChR 2 in a four state transition rate model. Our goal in this work is to determine the conditions under which the four state model proposed by Nikolic et al. [2] can exhibit fast mono-exponential decay seen for the <b>E</b> <b>123</b> T mutant of ChR 2. We start from the four state transition rate model proposed by Nikolic et al. [2]. This model consists of two closed dark adapted states C 1 and C 2 and two open light adapted conducting states O 1 and O 2. The unknown parameters of the model to be estimated from experimental data are: transition rate parameters: {Gd 1,Gd 2,Gr, e 12, e 21 }, parameters ε 1 and ε 2 that capture the efficiency of light induced transition of the closed states, and the parameter g, which captures the relative permeability of the two open states to ion flow. We first identify constraints on the four state model parameters based on the experimental data by Nikolic et al. [2] on wild type ChR 2 photo-current generated in hippocampal cells for light stimulation with intensities I={ 0. 9, 11 } mW/mm 2. We show that the problem of estimating the unknown parameters defined above from the model derived constraints represents an under-determined system.

Swapping F 1 hairpins between the enzymes resulted in hybrid proteins resembling the donor proteins. Surprisingly, mutation of the intercalating residue F 102 {{had little effect on}} activity, while the double mutant V 101 A/F 102 A was catalytically impaired.
