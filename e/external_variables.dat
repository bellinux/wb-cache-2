2500|$|Oftentimes {{divorce is}} viewed as {{detrimental}} to one’s emotional health, but {{studies have shown that}} cultivating resilience may be beneficial to all parties involved. The level of resilience a child will experience after their parents have split is dependent on both internal and <b>external</b> <b>variables.</b> Some of these variables include their psychological and physical state and the level of support they receive from their schools, friends, and family friends. The ability to deal with these situations also stems from the child’s age, gender, and temperament. Children will experience divorce differently and thus their ability to cope with divorce will differ too. About 20–25% of children will “demonstrate severe emotional and behavioral problems” when going through a divorce. This percentage is notably higher than the 10% of children exhibiting similar problems in married families. Despite having divorces parents of approximately 75–80% of these children will [...] "develop into well-adjusted adults with no lasting psychological or behavioral problems". This comes to show that most children have the tools necessary to allow them to exhibit the resilience needed to overcome their parents’ divorce.|$|E

2500|$|Light is {{important}} to lotic systems, because it provides the energy necessary to drive primary production via photosynthesis, and can also provide refuge for prey species in shadows it casts. [...] The amount of light that a system receives {{can be related to}} a combination of internal and external stream variables. [...] The area surrounding a small stream, for example, might be shaded by surrounding forests or by valley walls. [...] Larger river systems tend to be wide so the influence of <b>external</b> <b>variables</b> is minimized, and the sun reaches the surface. [...] These rivers also tend to be more turbulent, however, and particles in the water increasingly attenuate light as depth increases. [...] Seasonal and diurnal factors might also play a role in light availability because the angle of incidence, the angle at which light strikes water can lead to light lost from reflection. [...] Known as Beer's Law, the shallower the angle, the more light is reflected and the amount of solar radiation received declines logarithmically with depth. Additional influences on light availability include cloud cover, altitude, and geographic position (Brown 1987).|$|E

40|$|We propose two {{new methods}} for {{estimating}} models with nonseparable errors and endogenous regressors. The first method estimates a local average response. One estimates {{the response of}} the conditional mean of the dependent variable to a change in the explanatory variable while conditioning on an <b>external</b> <b>variable</b> and then undoes the conditioning. The second method estimates the nonseparable function and the joint distribution of the observable and unobservable explanatory <b>variables.</b> An <b>external</b> <b>variable</b> is used to impose an equality restriction, at two points of support, on the conditional distribution of the unobservable random term given the regressor and the <b>external</b> <b>variable.</b> Our methods apply to cross sections, but our lead examples involve panel data cases in which the choice of the <b>external</b> <b>variable</b> is guided by the assumption that the distribution of the unobservable variables is exchangeable in the values of the endogenous variable for members of a group.

In this study, different models are compared so as to propose the best one. From the results, systematic equations forecast better than single equation do.
