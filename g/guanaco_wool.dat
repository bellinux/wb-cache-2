30|$|Monitoring guanacos in Santa Cruz {{could be}} wrongly {{considered}} unaffordable by wildlife managers if not evaluated within a cost-benefit analysis. The economic cost of well interspersed survey transects throughout the territory, {{developed by a}} team of three experienced observers during 10 to 15 days, should be counterbalanced against the potential economic benefit of direct income derived from guanaco products and the large conservation benefits arising from land use diversification. Additionally, considering the relatively predictable guanaco local distribution due to male territorial fidelity over the years, the effect of management practices on guanaco populations could be easily surveyed and monitored to evaluate trends (Young and Franklin 2004 a). The sustained yield harvesting of <b>guanaco</b> <b>wool</b> and/or meat, complementary or supplementary to sheep ranching, may be {{the most effective way to}} conserve guanacos (Fritz and Franklin 1994) and other wildlife, if land owners acknowledge the potential economic return of this species. Diversifying land uses and adopting sustainable forms of guanaco exploitation should be the shared objectives of Argentine wildlife agencies, as a potential mechanism pursuing both the reduction of the ecological damage of sheep overgrazing and the socioeconomic improvement of rural communities in Patagonia rangelands.|$|E
50|$|Guanaco fiber is {{particularly}} prized for its soft, warm feel and {{is found in}} luxury fabric. The <b>guanaco's</b> soft <b>wool</b> is valued second only {{to that of the}} vicuña. The pelts, particularly from the calves, are sometimes used as a substitute for red fox pelts, because the texture is difficult to differentiate. Like their domestic descendant, the llama, the guanaco is double-coated with coarse guard hairs and a soft undercoat, the hairs of which are about 16-18 µ in diameter and comparable to the best cashmere.|$|R
40|$|Felting is {{a unique}} {{attribute}} of animal fibres used {{for the production of}} a range of industrial and apparel textiles. Felting can be an adverse attribute as a consequence of dimensional shrinkage during laundering. As there is little objective information regarding the feltability of rare animal fibres or the factors which may affect felting three investigations were undertaken. A survey (n = 114) of the feltability of cashmere from different origins of production, cashgora, quivet, camel hair, llama, <b>guanaco,</b> bison <b>wool,</b> cow fibre and yak wool quantified the large variation between and within these fibre types. Cashmere from some origins and cashgora produced higher feltball density than the other fibres. Different nutritional management of cashmere goats (n = 35) showed that cashmere grown by poorly fed goats had a lower propensity to felt compared with cashmere grown by better fed goats. A consequence of the progressive blending of cashmere (n = 27) with a low propensity to felt superfine wool (high fibre curvature) increased the propensity of the blend to felt, but when the same cashmere was blended with low curvature superfine wool, there was little or no effect on feltability. The mechanisms which lead to variance in feltability of these fibres were quantified with multiple regression modelling. The mechanisms were similar to those reported for wools, namely variations in the resistance to compression, fibre curvature and mean fibre diameter, with likely effects of fibre crimp form. It is possible to source cashmere and other animal fibres which have different propensities to felt and therefore to produce textiles which are likely to have different textile properties. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Softness of apparel {{textiles}} {{is a major}} attribute {{sought by}} consumers. There is surprisingly little objective information on the softness properties of rare animal fibres, particularly cashmere, alpaca and mohair. Samples {{of these and other}} rare animal fibres from different origins of production and processors were objectively measured for fibre diameter, fibre curvature (FC, crimp) and resistance to compression (softness). While there were curvilinear responses of resistance to compression to FC and to mean fibre diameter, FC accounted for much more of the variance in resistance to compression. Fibre type was an important determinant of resistance to compression. The softest fibres were alpaca, mohair and cashgora and all of the fibres measured were softer than most Merino wool. Quivet, llama, camel, <b>guanaco,</b> vicuña, yak <b>wool,</b> bison wool, dehaired cow down and Angora rabbit were also differentiated from alpaca, mohair and cashmere. There were important differences in the softness and FC of cashmere from different origins with cashmere from newer origins of production (Australia, New Zealand and USA) having lower resistance to compression than cashmere from traditional sources of China and Iran. Cashmere from different origins was differentiated on the basis of resistance to compression, FC and fibre diameter. Cashgora was differentiated from cashmere by having a lower FC and lower resistance to compression. There were minority effects of colour and fibre diameter variation on resistance to compression of cashmere. The implications of these findings for the identification and use of softer raw materials are discussed...|$|R
