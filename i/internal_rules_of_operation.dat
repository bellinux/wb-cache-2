In the House, a Rules Committee guides legislation; in the Senate, a Standing Rules committee is in charge. Each branch has its own traditions; for example, the Senate relies heavily on the practice of getting [...] "unanimous consent" [...] for noncontroversial matters. House and Senate rules can be complex, sometimes requiring a hundred specific steps before becoming a law. Members sometimes use experts such as Walter Oleszek, a senior specialist in American national government at the Congressional Research Service, to learn about proper procedures.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{category}} focuses on deficits in social cognition. Simon Baron-Cohen's empathizing-systemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop <b>internal</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism {{is an extreme}} case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing. [...] These theories are somewhat related to Baron-Cohen's earlier theory of mind approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis {{is supported by the}} atypical responses of children with autism to the Sally-Anne test for reasoning about others' motivations, and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in Pathophysiology maps well to the hypothesis. However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on {{the charter}} at the {{foundation}} of the entity, and depending on the legal framework under which the entity was created, the form of ownership is determined once and for all time. To change it requires significant work in terms of communicating with stakeholders (member-owners, governments, etc.) and acquiring their approval. Whatever structural constraints or disadvantages exist at the creation thus remain {{an integral part of the}} entity. Common in for instance New York City, Hamburg and Berlin in Germany is a form of real estate ownership known as a cooperative (also co-operative or co-op, in German Wohnungsgenossenschaft - apartment co-operative, also [...] "Wohnbaugenossenschaft" [...] or simply [...] "Baugenossenschaft") which relies heavily on <b>internal</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> instead of the legal framework governing condominium associations. These [...] "co-ops", owning the building for the mutual benefit of its members, can ultimately perform most of the functions of a legally constituted condominium, i.e. restricting use appropriately and containing financial liabilities to within tolerable levels. To change their structure now that they are up and operating would require significant effort to achieve acceptance among members and various levels of government.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} question {{under what conditions}} will rank and file legislators favor or oppose changes in a legislature?s <b>internal</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> order. The study deviates from previous approaches {{to the study of}} legislatures in four primary ways: 1) the study moves from advanced democratized cases of the U. S. Congress and British House of Commons to cases of neo-democracies; 2) the study considers the interaction between the design of the electoral system and its impact on legislature organization; 3) in addition to chamber level factors, party and individual level factors are considered; and 4) the theory considers when legislators will rebel against attempts by party leadership to alter the <b>internal</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> order. The central question focused on is what factors influence legislators? willingness to speak out or vote against changes in the <b>internal</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> order following a change in the electoral system design. The theory proposed {{that when it comes to}} changing the <b>internal</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> order of a legislative chamber, the effective number of parties in the chamber, the effect of proposed changes in the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> order on legislator behavior, party discipline, and the nature of legislator ambition affect the probability that change occurs. Experimental and statistical methodologies are used to test the hypotheses derived from the theory. Original data were collected from experiments conducted on undergraduate pupils at Texas A&M University. For the statistical analyses, a data set of proposed changes in the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> order were compiled using archived data from the Colombian Senate and Peruvian Congress. This multi-method approach was used because of the nature of the question under examination and to minimize limitations of the individual methodologies. The experimental analyses demonstrate that the <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> the theory are supported in the controlled environment of the experiment. The results from the statistical analyses were, within the restrictions imposed by the data, consistent with both theoretical expectations and the experimental findings. The most consistent factor influencing change in the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> order is the effect of the proposal followed by party discipline...|$|R

5000|$|If it is {{important}} to be secure, then it {{is important}} to be sure all of the security policy is enforced by mechanisms that are strong enough. There are many organized methodologies and risk assessment strategies to assure completeness of security policies and assure that they are completely enforced. In complex systems, such as information systems, policies can be decomposed into sub-policies to facilitate the allocation of security mechanisms to enforce sub-policies. However, this practice has pitfalls. It is too easy to simply go directly to the sub-policies, which are essentially the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> and dispense with the top level policy. That gives the false sense that the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> address some overall definition of security when they do not. Because it is so difficult to think clearly with completeness about security, <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> stated as [...] "sub-policies" [...] with no [...] "super-policy" [...] usually turn out to be rambling rules that fail to enforce anything with completeness. Consequently, a top-level security policy is essential to any serious security scheme and sub-policies and <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> are meaningless without it.|$|R
