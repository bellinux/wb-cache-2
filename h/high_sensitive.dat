It is also demonstrated that serum gamma-glutamyltransferase activity is an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction and cardiac death in patients with coronary artery disease. Although the relationship between gamma-glutamyltransferase and coronary artery disease has been reported, not many studies have shown the relationship between changes ofgamma-glutamyltransferase in acute coronary syndromes and a well established coronary risk factor <b>high</b> <b>sensitive</b> C-reactive protein. (hs-CRP). Aims: In this study, how gamma-glutamyltransferase levels changed in acute coronary syndromes and its relationship with <b>high</b> <b>sensitive</b> C-reactive protein if any were studied. Patients & Methods:This trial was carried out at Kosuyolu Cardiovascular Training and Research Hospital and Van Yuksek Ihtisas Hospital, Turkey. 219 patients (177 males and 42 females) presenting with acute coronary syndrome, and 51 control subjects between September 2007 and September 2008 were included in the study.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to observe if rapid injection of local anesthetics via a 27 G Whitacre needle led to <b>higher</b> <b>sensitive</b> block levels compared to a 24 G Sprotte needle. Methods : 20 ASA I or II patients scheduled for elective orthopedic surgery of the lower limbs were randomized in two groups after 1 KB approval and verbal consent. The two groups received a standard infusion line with 500 ml lactate-Ringer solution. The first group received a combined spinal epidural anesthesia in a sitting position at L 2 - L 3 interspace via a 17 G Tuohy-Weiss needle with loss of resistance to air after which a 27 G long spinal needle with the side-port in a cephalad direction was inserted and 3 ml heavy bupivacaine were injected in 10 seconds after obtaining free flow of CSF. The second group received spinal anesthesia in the same position with a 24 G Sprotte needle with the side-port in a cephalad direction and received the same amount of heavy bupivacaine in 10 seconds. In the two groups, patients were placed supine four minutes after the spinal. All patients were monitored with one lead ECG, SpO 2 and N 1 BP. Sensitive block levels were measured in the midline with ether every five minutes from 5 to 40 minutes after the spinal. Blood pressure was closely monitored and a 20 % decrease or a blood pressure < 100 nunHg was treated by atropine or ephedrine or phenylephrine depending on the heart rate. Results :The two groups were demographically comparable. Sensitive block levels were significantly higher in the 27 G group from 20 to the end of the measurements. At 20 minutes, mean levels in thoracic dermatomes were : 5. 6 in the 27 G group and 7. 8 in the 24 G group (p= 0. 024 / Mann-Whitney). At 25 minutes, mean levels in thoracic dermatomes were : 5. 1 in the 27 G group and 7. 1 in the 24 G group (p= 0. 015). At 30, 35 and 40 minutes, mean levels in thoracic dermatomes were : 5 in the 27 G group and 7 in the 24 G group (p< 0. 025). The use of vasopressors was not different between the two groups. Conclusions :We observed <b>higher</b> <b>sensitive</b> block levels with a mean difference of two dermatomes when we performed fast injection through a 27 G Whitacre spinal needle compared to a 24 G Sprotte needle with a large side-port.

Bu çalışmanın amacı, metabolik sendromlu hastalarda serum prokalsitonin, total sialik asid ve hassas C-reaktif protein düzeylerini birlikte inceleyerek metabolik sendromun tanısında biyokimyasal belirteç olarak rollerini değerlendirmektir. Çalışmamıza yeni metabolik sendrom tanısı alan 30 - 60 yaş arası 45 metabolik sendromlu olgu ve 31 sağlıklı gönüllü dahil edildi. Metabolik sendrom tanısı 'The İnternational Diabetes Federation' kriterlerine göre konuldu. Serum total sialik asid düzeyleri metabolik sendromlu hasta grubunda kontrol grubundan anlamlı olarak yüksekti (p 0. 05). Hasta grubunda total sialik asid ile vücut kitle indeksi (p= 0. 009), insülin (p= 0. 001) ve 'Homeostasis Model Assesment' indeksi (p= 0. 014) arasında pozitif korelasyon saptandı.

In {{the patient}} group, {{there was a}} {{positive}} correlation between total sialic acid levels and body mass index (p= 0. 009), insulin (p= 0. 001) and Homeostasis Model Assesment index (p= 0. 014).

In the regression analysis that was performed to investigate the variables that could have effects on serum total sialic acid and <b>high</b> <b>sensitive</b> C-reactive protein, it was found that on the total sialic acid levels, both of body mass index and insulin and on the CRP levels just the body mass index were determinant factors.

In addition, it was exposed that total sialic acid had higher sensitivity than <b>high</b> <b>sensitive</b> C-reactive protein in parallel with previous studies. In conclusion, in our study, it was observed that the levels of serum <b>high</b> <b>sensitive</b> C reactive protein and total sialic acid were significantly increased in metabolic syndrome.

Therefore, serum <b>high</b> <b>sensitive</b> C reactive protein and total sialic acid levels may be used as biochemical markers for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—A {{prospective}} study was undertaken on {{the diagnosis of}} herpes simplex encephalitis (HSVE) by comparing chemiluminescence assay (CL) and two different sensitive polymerase chain reactions (PCRs).  METHODS—The materials comprised 53 serial CSF samples from 31 patients with acute encephalitis with suspected HSVE. Each CSF was distributed to three independent laboratories to perform quantitative measurements by CL, the low sensitive (single) PCR, and <b>high</b> <b>sensitive</b> (nested) PCR. The CL provided a method of detecting HSV itself and the small fragment with HSV antigenicity which was composed of viral component proteins. The serial CSFs were found retrospectively to comprise 24 samples from 11 patients with HSVE due to HSV 1 and 29 samples from 20 patients with non-HSVE.  RESULTS— the CL showed 50 to 48 000 pfu/ml in all samples of HSVE (except one) taken from the 3 rd to the 25 th day. The low sensitive PCR demonstrated 50 to 47 000 pfu/ml in only six samples of HSVE. The <b>high</b> <b>sensitive</b> PCR disclosed less than 100 to 120 000 copies/ml in 11 samples of HSVE. At the acute stage from the 1 st to 7 th day, the sensitivities of CL and the <b>high</b> <b>sensitive</b> PCR were 100 %, but that of the low sensitive PCR was 75 %. The sensitivity of CL {{was significantly higher than}} those of both PCRs after the acute stage on the 15 th to 32 nd day. The specificities and positive predictive values of the three methods were 100 %. However, the negative predictive value of CL was significantly higher than that of the low sensitive PCR.  CONCLUSIONS—The sensitivity of CL is equivalent to that of the <b>high</b> <b>sensitive</b> PCR during the acute stage and significantly higher than that of the <b>high</b> <b>sensitive</b> PCR after the acute stage. A clear difference in sensitivity exists between the different PCRs. A combination of the PCR, chemiluminescence assay, and serological antibody diagnosis is currently considered the most effective approach for the clinical diagnosis of HSVE. ...|$|E
