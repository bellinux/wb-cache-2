40|$|Samples of {{terrestrial}} atmospheric gasses from a free body of such gasses using a device {{characterized by a}} plurality of tubular bodies adapted to be mounted in side by side relation on a motorized highway vehicle in mutual parallelism with the axis of the normal path of travel for the vehicles. Each of the bodies is of a cylindrical configuration and has an axial opening at each of its opposite ends through which a linear flow path is defined. A pair of pivotally supported, spring-biased sealing caps is mounted adjacent {{to the ends of}} the body and continuously urged into a hermetic sealing relationship. A restraint for securing the caps against spring-urged pivotal displacement, includes a separable, normally tensioned line interconnecting the caps and an operable release mechanism for simultaneously releasing the caps for spring-urged displacement. A <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> <b>cutter</b> is included for separating the line, whereby samples of air are trapped in the body as the caps are spring-driven to assume an hermetically sealed relation with the openings defined in each of the opposite ends of the body...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe study {{algorithmic}} {{questions related}} to cutting polyhedral shapes with a <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> <b>cutter.</b> Such cutters are popular manufacturing tools for cutting expanded polystyrene (styrofoam) with a thin, moving heated wire. In particular, we study the question of polyhedral-wise continuity: Can a given object be cut out without disconnecting and then reattaching the wire? In an abstract setting this question translates to properties of sets of lines and segments and therefore becomes suitable for computational geometry techniques. On the combinatorial and algorithmic levels the results and methods are related to two problems: (1)  given a set F={f 1,…,fk} of polygons and a polygon f, decide {{if there is a}} subset of lines in the set of lines not stabbing F that cover f; (2)  construct the connectivity graph for free movements of lines that maintain contact with the polyhedral shape. Problem (1) is solved with the dual projection and arrangements of convex and concave x-monotone curves. Problem (2) can be solved with a combination of the skewed projections [6] and hyperbola arrangements proposed by McKenna and O'Rourke [11]. We provide an O(n 5) algorithm for constructing a cutting path, if it exists. The complexity of the algorithm is determined by the O(n 4) size of the connectivity graph and the cost of solving (2) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{principle}} {{reasons for}} using the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> type of anemometer for turbulence measurements are outlined {{and some of the}} objectionable features limiting the applicability of the conventional type anemometer are pointed out. A brief historical background of the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> anemometer is followed by a consideration of various possibilities of improving the method of measuring the intensity of turbulence. This analysis purposes to show why such improvements can only be realized by a direct calibration of the <b>hot</b> <b>wire’s</b> response to velocity fluctuations. The consequent development of a new technique, referred to as the “Vibrator Method,” is then explained. A general discussion of the results of a series of investigations using the Vibrator method is then presented and includes: a comparison with the orthodox method; the response of the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> to periodic fluctuations relative to the validity of the theory of <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> lag; an extension of the method to correlation measurements using two <b>hot</b> <b>wires,</b> and other applications.

40|$|The {{question}} of whether a random measure of particle velocities yields a good statistical estimate of the stationary condition of the turbulence flow field was investigated by comparing hot-wire and laser velocimeter turbulence intensity measurements. Great care was taken to insure that the instrument precision of both the laser velocimeter and <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> was maximized. In this attempt to reduce the measurement uncertainties in the <b>hot</b> <b>wire,</b> direct digitization of the analog output signal was performed with point-by-point conversion to velocity through a spline fit calibration curve and the turbulence intensity function was calculated statistically.

40|$|The <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> method, with pH and {{temperature}} sensors, was evaluated {{to determine its}} usefulness and application for cheese production automation. Coagulation of milk substrate was measured with the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> instrument and by four other methods: Formagraph, Brookfield®, vixcometer, Omnispec™ bioactivity monitor, and Sommer and Matsen rolling bottle method. The <b>hot</b> <b>wire,</b> using the time at maximum slope, detected coagulation before methods that measure resistance to shear, and after methods that measure light reflectance. Coagulation time was {{not significantly different from}} the industry standard rolling bottle method used by Sommer and Matsen. the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> instrument was also used to distinguish samples that formed curd at different rates. This was accomplished by measuring the rate of temperature change of the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> probe during curd formation. Milk samples of varying protein, fat, and calcium concentrations were prepared to determine if the instrument could be used to predict a consistent curd cut-point. The pH level was also adjusted, and rennet additions were varied. Coagulation was monitored simultaneously with the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> system and a Formagraph. All five factors (pH, calcium, fat, protein, and rennet) had significant effects on cut time estimations (CT 20) on the Formagraph. Linear correlations (R 2) ranging from. 74 to. 94 were obtained using stepwise regressions when comparing <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> and compositional data with the Formagraph. A Formagraph was used to measure effects of calcium, pH, and rennet changes on the coagulation properties of late lactation milk. Calcium, pH, and rennet treatments significantly affected the coagulation parameters measured by the Formagraph. However, response among the poor coagulating samples to treatments to improve coagulation was sample dependent. General composition and SDS-PAGE fractionation data could not be used as an indicator of poor or good coagulability of samples. The <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> method worked well for monitoring coagulation time and curd firming rate, but did not measure maximum curd firmness well. Curd firming rates determined from the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> data are acceptable for estimation of a curd cut time. Added benefits of the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> method for monitoring cheese manufacture are that stirring, coagulation, and healing of curd can also be measured. Therefore, the rates of change of important parameters, such as pH, temperature, and coagulation during critical processing steps, can easily be determined by a computer and displayed, printed out, or saved for future evaluation...|$|R
