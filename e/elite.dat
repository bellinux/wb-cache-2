5|$|Robert Hartwell {{notes that}} in the Northern Song dynasty there were two types of elites who {{dominated}} the civil service: a founding <b>elite</b> and a professional <b>elite.</b> The founding <b>elite</b> consisted of the North China military governors of the 10th century, their associates, personal staffs, and bureaucrats who {{had served in the}} capitals of the administrations of the previous Five Dynasties. The professional bureaucracy consisted of <b>elite</b> families who had established residence in Kaifeng or subordinate capitals, claimed prestigious clan ancestry, had intermarried with other prominent families, had members in higher offices over generations, and periodically dominated Song government until the 12th century. The prominent families of this professional <b>elite</b> accounted for 18 of the 11th century chancellors, the highest official post. From 960 to 986, the founding military <b>elite</b> from Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Hebei represented 46% of fiscal offices, people from districts in Songzhou—the military governorship of the founding emperor—represented 22% of fiscal offices, and those from Kaifeng and Luoyang filled 13% of fiscal posts. In the same period, the founding <b>elite</b> and professional <b>elite</b> filled over 90% of policy-making positions. However, after 983, when the south had been conquered and consolidated into the empire, a semi-hereditary professional <b>elite</b> gradually replaced the founding <b>elite.</b> After 1086 not a single family of the founding <b>elite</b> had a member in either policy-making or financial positions. Between 998 and 1085, the 35 most important families of the professional <b>elite</b> represented only 5% of the families that had members in policy-making offices, yet they disproportionately held 23% of these positions. By the late 11th century the professional <b>elite</b> began to break apart as a distinguishable status group aiming for civil service. They were replaced by a multitude of local gentry lineages who had their children pursue a slew of different professions other than official careers. Hartwell states that this shift of power {{was the result of the}} professional elite's lineage strategies being undermined by the rise of factional partisan politics in the latter half of the 11th century.|$|E

I argue that the politics of multiracial officials depends on their specific racial backgrounds, not just their multiracial status. I find evidence that non-Black multiracial <b>elites</b> have freedom to assert their identities in ways not available to multiracial-Black <b>elites,</b> suggesting that the American historical context of anti-miscegenation and the one-drop rule still has ramifications for minority <b>elites</b> today.

The stability of local <b>elites</b> is {{for the purposes of this}} thesis defined as the number of election of the same representatives in communal elections in between 1994 and 2010. There are three main objectives in the thesis. Firstly, to prove a dependence between stability of local <b>elites</b> and population of the municipality. Secondly, to find if there is statistically significant dependence between stability of local <b>elites</b> and selected development factors. Thirdly to identify spatial patterns of high and low stability of local <b>elites</b> in the Czech Republic. To complete this objectives required to design methodology and calculate stability of local <b>elites</b> for the municipalities of Czech Republic and then to categorize it according to its level of stability (low, medium, high). On behalf of several quantitative analyses the indirect dependence between stability of local <b>elites</b> and the municipality population has been proven as well as the dependence between the selected development factors (intensity of flat construction, unemployment and percentage of undergraduates).
