40|$|Objective: The authors {{examine whether}} an {{innovative}} family economic empowerment intervention addresses mental health functioning of AIDS-affected children in communities heavily impacted by HIV/AIDS in Uganda. Methods: A cluster {{randomised controlled trial}} consisting of two study arms, a treatment condition (n= 179) and a control condition (n= 118), {{was used to examine}} the impact of the family economic empowerment intervention on children's levels of hopelessness and depression. The intervention comprised matched children savings accounts, financial management workshops and mentorship. Data were collected at baseline and 12 months post-intervention. Results: Using multivariate analysis with several socioeconomic controls, the authors find that children in the treatment condition (receiving the <b>intervention)</b> <b>report</b> significant improvement in their mental health functioning. Specifically, the intervention reduces hopelessness and depression levels. On the other hand, children in the control condition (not receiving the <b>intervention)</b> <b>report</b> no changes on both measures. Conclusions: The findings indicate that children with poor mental health functioning living in communities affected by HIV/AIDS may benefit from innovative family economic empowerment interventions. As measures of mental health functioning, both hopelessness and depression have long-term negative psychosocial and developmental impacts on children. These findings have implications for public health programmes intended for long-term care and support of children living in resource poor AIDS-impacted communities. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

A systematic search of electronic databases for original research articles published in peer-review journals between January 1985 and the end of June 2006 was carried out. A total of 19 studies that <b>reported</b> <b>intervention</b> effects on physical activity and mediators of behavioural change were identified. The most common mediators reported included physical activity knowledge or beliefs (11 studies); self-efficacy (8 studies); and enjoyment or preference for physical activity (6 studies).

40|$|Background : The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if patients with advanced breast cancer and their family caregivers, who participated in a family based <b>intervention,</b> <b>report</b> better quality of life and other psychosocial outcomes than dyads who received standard care alone. Methods : Using a randomized clinical trial, 134 patients and their family caregivers were assigned to usual care (control) or to usual care plus the family intervention (experimental condition). Dyads were assessed at baseline, three- and six-months later. The intervention consisted of five sessions and addressed family involvement, optimistic attitude, coping effectiveness, uncertainty reduction, and symptom management. Results : Patients in the family intervention reported significantly less hopelessness and less negative appraisal of illness than controls; their family caregivers reported significantly less negative appraisal of caregiving. Intervention effects were evident at three-months, but were not sustained at six-months. No difference was found in the quality of life of dyads in experimental or control conditions. Conclusions : Although the family intervention had positive effects initially, these effects were not sustained over time.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the economic efficiency of alternative types of intervention with language-impaired preschool children. Forty children {{were randomly assigned to}} one of four groups: (a) home-based (parent-delivered) intervention, (b) center-based intervention, (c) both center- and home-based intervention, and (d) no treatment. The home intervention program taught parents to incorporate therapy techniques into ordinary parent-child interactions in the home and to create a language-stimulating home environment. Center-based treatment emphasized language development in individual, small group, and large group settings. The combined intervention group received both the home- and center-based programs. Program effectiveness was measured with two language scales (PLS-R, APPS). Cost analysis encompassed all resources consumed by the program, including the time contributed by parents and students. The results indicated that the home-based program was more efficient. The center-based intervention was more expensive and less effective. Combining the two types of intervention increased costs without significantly increasing effectiveness. Although the study was limited in size and duration, it suggests that future research should investigate the potential of parent-delivered services to be effective, low-cost alternatives to center-based early intervention. 0 Most studies of early <b>intervention</b> <b>report</b> positive outcomes, although program effec-tiveness varies for reasons that are not en-tirely clear but that may relate to program characteristics such as intensity and paren...|$|E

Medication and surgical treatments are potentially available to those unable to implement 'lifestyle interventions' effectively by achieving losses of between 5 kg and 10 kg. It is accepted that the minimum of 5 % weight loss is required to achieve clinically-meaningful benefits. Dietary treatments differ widely. Successful weight loss is most often associated with quantification of energy intake rather than macronutrient composition. Most dietary intervention studies secure a weight loss of between 5 kg and 10 kg after intervention for 6 months, with gradual weight regain at I year where weight changes are 3 - 4 kg below the starting weight.

Design Analysis of a random sample of systematic reviews of non-pharmacological stroke interventions; online survey of review authors. Data sources and study selection The Cochrane Library and PubMed were searched for potentially eligible systematic reviews and a random sample of these assessed for eligibility until 60 (30 Cochrane, 30 non-Cochrane) eligible reviews were identified. Data collection In each review, the completeness of the intervention description in each eligible trial (n= 568) was assessed by 2 independent raters using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist. All review authors (n= 46) were invited to complete a survey. Results Most reviews were missing intervention information for the majority of items. The most incompletely described items were: modifications, fidelity, materials, procedure and tailoring (missing from all interventions in 97 %, 90 %, 88 %, 83 % and 83 % of reviews, respectively). Items that scored better, but were still incomplete for the majority of reviews, were: ‘when and how much’ (in 31 % of reviews, adequate for all trials; in 57 % of reviews, adequate for some trials); intervention mode (in 22 % of reviews, adequate for all trials; in 38 %, adequate for some trials); and location (in 19 % of reviews, adequate for all trials).

The primary aim is to evaluate whether adult consumers accessing services where staff have received the <b>intervention</b> <b>report</b> superior recovery outcomes compared to adult consumers accessing services where staff have not yet received the intervention. A qualitative sub-study aims to examine staff and consumer views on implementing recovery-oriented practice.

Methods: The mixed methods design incorporates a two-step stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) examining cross-sectional data from three phases, and nested qualitative and process evaluation sub-studies. Participating specialist mental health care services in Melbourne, Victoria are divided into 14 clusters with half randomly allocated to receive the staff training in year one and half in year two. Research participants are consumers aged 18 - 75 years who attended the cluster within a previous three-month period either at baseline, 12 (step 1) or 24 months (step 2). In the two nested sub-studies, participation extends to cluster staff. The primary outcome is the Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery collected from 756 consumers (252 each at baseline, step 1, step 2). Secondary and other outcomes measuring well-being, service satisfaction and health economic impact are collected from a subset of 252 consumers (63 at baseline; 126 at step 1; 63 at step 2) via interviews. Interview based longitudinal data are also collected 12 months apart from 88 consumers with a psychotic disorder diagnosis (44 at baseline, step 1; 44 at step 1, step 2). cRCT data will be analyzed using multilevel mixed-effects modelling to account for clustering and some repeated measures, supplemented by thematic analysis of qualitative interview data. The process evaluation will draw on qualitative, quantitative and documentary data.

A twelve month follow up will be completed by March 2013 and results are expected by April 2013. DiscussionThis cluster randomized community intervention trial on DSS will enable policy makers to find out the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and cost utility of decision support system for management of blood pressure among hypertensive patients in India. Most of the previous studies on decision support system have focused on physician performance, adherence and on preventive care reminders. The uniqueness of the proposed study lies in finding out the effectiveness of a decision support system on patient related outcomes.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether a couple-oriented intervention for osteoarthritis (OA) was more efficacious than a patient-oriented intervention and whether each intervention was more efficacious than usual medical care. Research Design: 242 older adults with OA and their spouses {{were randomly assigned to}} patient-oriented education and support, couple-oriented education and support, or usual care. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses indicated {{no significant differences between the}} 3 study conditions in outcomes for individuals with OA or their spouses. Completers analyses showed that at the 6 -month follow-up, contrary to prediction, individuals with OA who received the patient-oriented <b>intervention</b> <b>reported</b> greater reductions in pain and improvements in physical function than those who received the couple-oriented intervention. At the postintervention assessment, spouses who received the couple-oriented <b>intervention</b> <b>reported</b> greater reductions in stress and a trend toward less critical attitudes than spouses of individuals with OA who received the patient-oriented intervention. Moderator analyses indicated that female spouses and spouses with high marital satisfaction who received the couple-oriented intervention also experienced better outcomes in terms of depressive symptoms and caregiver mastery. Conclusions: A couples approach to education and support for OA may offer no advantage for individuals with OA but may prove helpful for spouses, thereby indirectly benefiting individuals with OA over time...|$|R
40|$|This chapter reviews {{empirical}} {{studies that have}} examined nature of science (NOS) and argumentation in science education. The review sought to explore {{the nature of this}} relationship and examined studies conducted in socioscientific and scientific contexts. A critical review of 23 {{empirical studies}} from high-quality science education journals found many similarities regarding {{the nature of the relationship}} between NOS and argumentation in both contexts. Assessment studies in both contexts found evidence of the influence of NOS views on reasoning and positive relationships linking informed views of NOS to high-quality argumentation. Intervention studies in both contexts indicate that NOS views influence argumentation, although in different ways. An important point of difference between contexts related to the inclusion of explicit NOS instruction, with socioscientific <b>interventions</b> <b>reporting</b> improvements in NOS views with explicit NOS instruction; whereas scientific <b>interventions</b> <b>reported</b> improvements in NOS views without implementing explicit NOS instruction. The duration of the intervention was also found to be a pivotal factor in the success of the examined studies, with longer interventions producing more favourable results. In addition, studies underpinned by sociocultural perspectives were generally successful in achieving their desired aims.

40|$|Rationale, {{aims and}} {{objectives}} Evidence-based practice {{is becoming increasingly}} important in primary care physiotherapy. Clinical practice needs to reflect current best evidence and be concordant with evidence-based clinical guidelines. There is limited knowledge about therapeutic interventions used in primary care physiotherapy in Sweden. The objectives were to examine preferred treatment <b>interventions</b> <b>reported</b> by publicly employed physiotherapists in primary care for three common musculoskeletal disorders (low back pain, neck pain and subacromial pain), {{the extent to which}} these interventions were supported by evidence, and associations with demographic variables. Methods 419 physiotherapists in primary care in western Sweden were surveyed using a validated web-based questionnaire. Results The survey was completed by 271 respondents (65 %). Median number of <b>interventions</b> <b>reported</b> was 7 (range 1 – 16). The most common treatment interventions across the three conditions were advice on posture (reported by 82 – 94 %), advice to stay active (86 – 92 %), and different types of exercise (65 – 92 %). Most of these interventions were supported by evidence. However, interventions with insufficient evidence, such as advice on posture, TENS and aquatic exercise, were also used by 29 – 96 %. Modalities such as laser therapy and ultrasound were sparingly used (< 5 %), which is in line with evidence. For neck pain, use of evidence-based interventions was associated with gender and for subacromial pain, with work experience. Conclusions Advice and exercise therapy were the <b>interventions</b> most frequently <b>reported</b> across the three diagnoses, illustrating an active treatment strategy. While most <b>reported</b> <b>interventions</b> are supported by evidence, interventions with unclear or no evidence of effect were also used to a high extent.
