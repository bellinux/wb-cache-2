40|$|Applying the pretensioners and {{the belt}} <b>force</b> <b>limiters</b> in cars had a {{positive}} impact on the seat belts effectiveness in protecting the people driving against the effects of collisions. In this way, delayed action of the seat belts, resulting from the flexibility of the belt and the operating time of the retractor locking mechanism, was partially eliminated. The tasks and properties of the pretensioners and <b>force</b> <b>limiters</b> used in cars will be described in the paper. Implementations of the forces acting at the driver's lap belts and shoulder belts during a frontal collision into a rigid barrier, at the speed of 56 km/h, will be presented. On this basis the properties of the pretensioners and belt <b>force</b> <b>limiters</b> will be determined. The characteristics of rigidity (force- displacement) of the shoulder belts of various designs will be presented, too. On the basis {{of the results of the}} crash tests (NHTSA, USA) for several cars the dynamic loads, which act on the driver during a frontal collision into a rigid barrier, will be analysed. The biomechanical indices of the human immune to the effects of shock loads will be taken into account. The analysis will include the passenger cars (sedan) from the years 1995 – 2004, which were fitted with the seat belts of various designs...|$|R

40|$|We {{successfully}} utilise the SPARC code {{to model}} fast-Alfvén mode conversion {{in the region}} c_A ≫ c_S via 3 -D MHD numerical simulations of helioseismic waves within constant inclined magnetic field configurations. This was achieved only after empirically modifying the background density and gravitational stratifications in the upper layers of our computational box, as opposed to imposing a traditional Lorentz <b>Force</b> <b>limiter,</b> to ensure a manageable timestep. We found that the latter approach inhibits the fast-Alfvén mode conversion process by severely damping the magnetic flux above the surface.

40|$|During the {{placement}} of components in micro-assembly, high impact forces occur. The current approach is to reduce these impact forces by coupling the gripper to the drive unit of {{the placement}} device with 5 DOF, wherein the gripper that contacts the component has a relatively low mass. To prevent the gripper from bouncing back {{at the end of}} the placement collision a force must be exerted between gripper and drive unit, which can significantly increase the impact forces. A solution has been found to realise an adequate force build-up between gripper and drive unit such that a rebounce of the gripper is prevented without significantly increasing the impact forces. This solution can be implemented relatively easily by placing a spring between gripper and drive unit combined with a <b>force</b> <b>limiter...</b>|$|E
40|$|In the Netherlands, {{the use of}} {{seat belts}} results in a yearly {{reduction}} of hundreds of fatalities. Seat belts {{reduce the risk of}} fatal injury by 37 to 48 %, depending on the position in the car. At 50 %, the effect of child protection devices is even slightly higher. When last measured (in 2010), 97 % of the front seat occupants in cars used a seat belt, and so did approximately 82 % of backseat occupants. In delivery vans, lorries and buses equipped with seat belts, the use of seat belts is lower. Circa 68 % of children are transported with sufficient protection. Seat belts are continuously being improved. For instance, there are systems to reduce the forces that seat belts exert on the human body (the seat belt tensioner and the <b>force</b> <b>limiter)</b> and to activate the seat belt earlier during the crash process (pre-crash sensors). Front airbags supplement seat belts. Airbags in the outer sides of the seats and in the rim of the roof have an important independent function in case of side-crashes or when the car hits a tree or other vertical object from the side...|$|E

40|$|The {{side impact}} gained more {{importance}} {{in the course of}} the last years. This is partially because of the fact that the safety level in the frontal impact rose clearly by many safety devices (Airbag, pre-tensioner, belt <b>force</b> <b>limiter,</b> crash zone, strong passenger compartment …). The reason for the high risk in side impacts is that bullet and target vehicle are mostly not compatible with each other. In the context of this work an investigation of the influences factors in side impact compatibility was carried out. The importance of the side impact was illustrated by accident data. Large progress in the area of soft and hardware made it possible to calculate numerically within a short time and with small costs physical procedures with sufficient accuracy. Numerical Simulation was used to investigate the influence factors of the side impact. The numeric models were validated on the basis a physical test. Before however the results from simulation and reality could be compared, three stages of the numerical model were numerically illustrated. In the first a dummy sat in an abstracted model of a vehicle interior. The models were extended up to the next model stage, in which a whole vehicle was represented by ellipsoids and by the numeric model of a EEVC Side Impact barrier. However it was recognized that the complex technical and geometrical structures of a vehicle body can be better illustrated by the finite element analysis method (FEA). Accordingly, FEA was used in the next model stage, which confirmed at the same time the numeric representation of the side impact model. After satisfying security of the numeric model twelve simulations were accomplished, in which different parameters were changed. Vehicle mass, barrier impact speed, the front of the bullet vehicle and the point of impact were changed. Measurement results of two EUROSID and the deformation mode of the target vehicle were evaluated in these parameter variations. It was shown that against expectation an even and wide intrusion did not always affect the Dummy results positively. From these parameter variations one case was selected and conducted a physical test for validation. This case represents "worst case" for the target vehicle, since in this impact configuration the bullet vehicle is over-riding the side sill of the target vehicle. The results from simulation and reality show to a large extent good agreements regarding deformations and the kinematics of both vehicles and dummies. A suggestion on the improvement of the compatibility in side impacts was realised. This consisted of filling the side sill of the target vehicle with polyurethane foam to stiffen the side sill and provide additional energy absorption potential at the same time. Thus both intrusion and lateral acceleration of the target vehicle were reduced. Both reduced the occupant load in the target vehicle. The best foam specification was identified by parameter variations with the target of minimising the occupant load. The effectiveness of this measure could be proven. In order to confirm the results, a final validation test was carried out. It can be stated that the used numerical models, in particular for the selected task, were well suitable. The results of this work support the statement that the selected measure – to fill the side sill with a suitable foam – improves the compatibility in side impacts...|$|E

50|$|For the Captiva, the {{production}} {{version of the}} S3X, both five- or seven-seat configurations are available. Standard safety features include: anti-lock brakes, electronic stability control (ESC), front seatbelt pre-tensioners and <b>force</b> <b>limiters,</b> and driver and front passenger airbags. Side curtain airbags are standard on higher luxury level variants in some markets. In crash safety tests conducted by Euro NCAP, the Captiva was given a {{four out of five}} star crash rating. The results from the test were helped by the use of high-strength steel used in the body shell which was designed to spread crash forces over distinct load channels, therefore ensuring the safety of the occupants within the safety cell. The vehicle's optional active all-wheel drive system is fully incorporated with the ESC and anti-lock braking systems, consequently increasing car handling and control. When the vehicle detects a loss of traction, the all-wheel drive mode is activated automatically. In ordinary driving situations, only the vehicle's front wheels are employed.|$|R

50|$|Standard {{active safety}} {{features}} also include electronically controlled braking (ECB), anti-lock brakes (ABS), and traction control (TRAC). The stability/traction control system, Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) (with disable button), incorporates Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB), Anti-Lock Brakes (ABS), Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), Traction Control (TRC) and Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) {{active safety systems}} with the Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS), Electric Power Steering (EPS) and Variable Gear Ratio Steering (VGRS) systems. VDIM integrates these systems to improve vehicle responsiveness to driver input and prevent loss of control. An Emergency Steering Assist system acts to minimize body roll and improve vehicle responsiveness in sudden maneuvers. This system reduces the steering gear ratio and prompts the suspension to adopt stiffer settings, helping make emergency maneuvers more stable and controlled. Passive safety features include eight to ten standard airbags (depending on model, up to eleven with upgraded rear seats), passenger detection systems, front and rear crumple zones, three-point seatbelts with pretensioners and <b>force</b> <b>limiters,</b> and a reinforced steel body. Dual-stage driver and twin-chambered front passenger airbags, front knee airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, and Thorax-Abdomen-Pelvis (TAP) airbags are also installed.|$|R

Rebecca Two tends to her twin sister`s bullet wound, inflicted by Will during the ambush. The Rebeccas spot in the distance a modern metropolis, with helicopters and other vehicles, including cars resembling Volkswagens. Rebecca Two sees a Limiter flare, and then signals back by blowing up a gas tank at the end of the mine shaft. She then continues to carry her dying sister toward the city. The Rebeccas find the city, and realise it is well maintained and populated. They, being potentially hostile outsiders, frighten a small amount of people, and that results in the arrival of a squad of the local army. The people of the city are from an expeditionary force from Nazi Germany that arrived during World War II. The <b>Limiter</b> <b>forces</b> arrive shortly, and a short staredown occurs, and after a Limiter medic begins to operate on Rebecca One, Rebecca Two and the Limiter General begin to talk about their identity to the authorities of the city.
