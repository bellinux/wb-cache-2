When testing the alternative hypothesis, whether stock prices significantly reacts to the announcement of right & <b>debenture</b> <b>issues,</b> results of all models show positive market reaction during the 30 days prior to the announcement and react negatively from 2 days after the announcements for right <b>issues,</b> but for <b>debenture</b> <b>issues</b> market reacted negatively during the period prior to <b>debenture</b> <b>issues</b> and continue to do the same during the post event period. Although the magnitude and significance of abnormal return generated through three alternatives methods differ, the pattern of the CAAR of all models are similar.

50|$|After the WWII, the Fanling {{property}} had badly {{suffered from}} general neglect which was understandable in the circumstances. The trees {{had been cut}} down for fuel {{and parts of the}} course including most of the greens had been used for vegetable cultivation. The New Course had been used for training and a large number of fox holes had been built. The clubhouse was requisitioned by the British Army after the war. The rehabilitation was as expensive as had been forecast. The Club not only spent all its account balances but had to arrange for an overdraft which at one time was over $400,000. (The price of daily newspaper in Hong Kong was 20 cents in 1947/48.) To reduce this liability a <b>debenture</b> <b>issue</b> was authorised on the basis of HK$500 per member. A few of the long established firms such as the Hong Kong Bank and Jardines also took up a number of the debentures to aid the Club. In 1963, an EGM was called and a Fanling Development Scheme was approved. Two resolutions were passed authorising the Committee to proceed with a scheme for the extension of the Fanling clubhouse and the issue of debentures to the amount of HK$900,000 to cover the costs. A building levy of HK$5 per month for all members was also introduced. Actual and estimated capital expenditure on the improvement to the clubhouse totalled HK$1,214,000. In early 1970s, to raise capital for the new complex, including the swimming pool and the mixed accommodation, a scheme of Nominee Memberships was introduced. On payment of HK$5,000 - soon raised to HK$10,000 - a firm became entitled, after approval by the Club, to nominate an employee to membership. The Nominee Memberships were transferable, again subject to the Club's approval, on payment of a commission to the Club. At the AGM in 1980, it was decided to issue 30 Nominee Memberships to meet the expense of a redevelopment scheme to include a swimming pool and squash courts in Deep Water Bay. The new building at Deep Water Bay was completed in early 1983 {{at a cost of about}} HK$25 million. The financial problems were eventually overcome. Following many years of loss, a profit was reported in 1984 for the third year running. Since then, the Club has remained in the black.|$|E

50|$|Insurance is {{restricted}} to registered member institutions, and covers only the first $100,000 in very specific categories of accounts, such as savings accounts and chequing accounts, guaranteed investment certificates (GICs) and other term deposits with an original term to maturity of five years or less, money orders, travellers' cheques and bank drafts issued by CDIC members and cheques certified by CDIC members, and <b>debentures</b> <b>issued</b> by loan companies that are CDIC members. Credit unions and Quebec and New Brunswick's caisses populaires are not insured federally, because they are created under provincial charters and backed by provincial insurance plans, which generally follow the federal model. Deposits in foreign currencies are not insured, even when held by a registered CDIC financial institution. Guaranteed Investment Certificates with a term longer than 5 years are also not insured. Funds in foreign banks operating in Canada are not covered. Some funds in Registered Retirement Savings Plans or Registered Retirement Income Funds at a bank may not be covered if they are invested in mutual funds or held in specific instruments like <b>debentures</b> <b>issued</b> by government or corporations. The general principle is to cover reasonable deposits and savings, but not deposits deliberately positioned to take risks for gain, such as mutual funds or stocks.|$|R

40|$|It {{shall be}} {{the purpose of this}} study to examine the new issues of {{industrial}} subordinated debentures in the period, 1955 - 1965, and seek to determine the prominent provisions of the subordinated debenture contract and if there have been any significant trends or changes in the contractual provisions during this period. The sources of data used in this study were the new issues of industrial subordinated <b>debentures</b> <b>issued</b> by industrial firms during the period, 1955 - 1965, with these limitations: (1) The <b>issues</b> of subordinated <b>debentures</b> of United States corporations were obtained by a search throughout the 1965 issue of Moody’s Industrial Manual and the indexes of the 1955 - 1964 and the 1966 issue of Moody’s Industrial Manual. This search resulted in a total of 535 new issues which accounted for a total volume of $ 5. 3 billion. (2) A sample of ninety-four subordinated <b>debenture</b> <b>issues</b> with a total volume of $ 697 million was selected from the universe of 535 new issues. The universe was arranged in alphabetical order by the year of issuance and each sixth issue was made part of the sample. In some instances, Moody’s Industrial Manual did not provide sufficient information for the purposes of the study and this necessitated the use of the seventh issue in the list. The study to determine whether there have been any significant trends in the contractual provisions and the major contractual provisions of industrial subordinated debentures will be approached by an examination of the major provisions, individually in each chapter of this thesis.

The purchase of the freehold on the land and the construction of the building was funded through donations amassed between 1919 and 1932, and <b>debentures</b> <b>issued</b> to insurance companies.

50|$|Shareholder {{dissatisfaction with}} the {{management}} of the IoWR continued to simmer despite the declaration of the highest-ever dividend on the ordinary stock. At a shareholders' meeting on 21 February 1883, a shareholder complained that running costs were too high, at 53% of gross receipts. In fact shareholders could expect a regular dividend as high as any paid by a railway company in Great Britain, but the differing classes of stock, with preference and <b>debenture</b> <b>issues,</b> which had differing levels of dividend distribution, continued to generate dissatisfaction. In 1889 the company placed a Bill before Parliament to consolidate and rearrange the capital: it received the Royal Assent on 25 July 1890. The authorised capital was £402,312 and borrowings amounted to £196,911.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze {{earnings}} management (EM) surrounding <b>debenture</b> <b>issues</b> of companies listed on the BM&FBOVESPA. EM is an intentional intervention in external financial reports in order to obtain some private gain. This practice is especially important at the time of <b>issuing</b> <b>debentures</b> because if earnings are inflated, investors may pay an artificially high price. To measure earnings management, current discretionary accruals were used as a proxy, based on the Modified Jones and Modified Jones with ROA econometric models. All of the regressions considered the fixed effects of the companies and the time series effects of the analyses. Evidence was found that companies inflate their financial results in the issuing period in order to positively influence their investors. The results suggest that there is EM in the quarter preceding the issue (t = - 1), indicating the influence that investors may have been under when making the decision to invest in debentures from these companies. In addition, it was verified that companies with higher debt, profitability, and sales growth ratios have higher levels of earnings management. The reputation of the auditor was not statistically significant regarding reductions in the level of management. The results also show that companies listed on Level II and New Market had higher levels of management when considering the Modified Jones with ROA model. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a greater level of earnings management in companies that <b>issue</b> <b>debentures</b> in the period preceding the event. Finally, the variable that is directly related to the level of earnings management is sales growth...|$|R

5000|$|In 1870, {{the town}} of Houlton offered a bonus of $30,000 to any company which would build, before 1872 had elapsed, a railway {{connecting}} Houlton with the terminus of the New Brunswick and Canada Railway near Debec, New Brunswick in Carleton County. [...] The Houlton Branch Railway Company was prepared to build the railway, on condition that {{the town of}} St. Stephen also pay a bonus, of $15,000. The Legislature of New Brunswick then passed an Act authorising the county of Charlotte to <b>issue</b> <b>debentures</b> to raise the $15,000, to be paid by municipal assessments on the real and personal property of the inhabitants of St. Stephen, provisional on a majority of two-thirds of the ratepayers of the parish of St. Stephens. [...] After the Act was passed, on 11 August 1870 {{there was a meeting}} of the ratepayers of St. Stephen, as required by the statute. [...] The requisite majority in favour of the Act was obtained and the <b>debentures</b> <b>issued.</b> The general sessions of the County of Charlotte then issued the necessary assessment on St. Stephen to pay the interest on the debentures. Some residents of St. Stephen, who included William T Black amongst their number, challenged the assessment in the courts.
