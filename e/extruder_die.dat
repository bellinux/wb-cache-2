40|$|<b>Extruder</b> <b>die</b> {{coatings}} {{were studied}} in the extrusion of modified polyethylene (PE-mod). When PE-mod is extruded at elevated temperatures, it will change into a high-viscosity polymer melt causing high pressure inside the <b>extruder</b> <b>die.</b> The temperature is elevated to activate a cross-linking reaction to endow the end product with favoured properties. However, the increased pressure renders difficulties in the extrusion process reducing production rate and increasing power consumption. For the efficient extrusion of PE-mod, a lubricant, non-sticking, and wear resistant coating is needed. Pressure drop across the <b>extruder</b> <b>die</b> can be decreased by increasing wall slipping. Certain molten polymers exhibit wall slip behaviour along the <b>extruder</b> <b>die</b> surface under sufficient shear stress. Low surface energy coatings, namely fluoropolymers, can substantially enhance slipping but their propensity to wear causes problems. By studying factors inducing wall slip, different coatings and surface treatments were chosen for comparative testing. Tests were done using a cone extruder with a custom fabricated annular <b>extruder</b> <b>die.</b> Pressure drop and drag force exerted on the torpedo of the die by flowing polymer melt were measured. Altogether six coatings were tested and a two-day continuous ex-trusion experiment was conducted for a fluoropolymer coating to gain better under-standing of the wear characteristics. In addition to pressure and force measurements, post-extrusion analyses for the fluoropolymer coating were made using scanning elec-tron microscopy (SEM), optical profiling, infrared spectroscopy (IR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Fluoropolymer coatings were shown to exhibit the strongest wall slipping behaviour by gaining the lowest pressure drops and drag forces over the <b>extruder</b> <b>die</b> surface at the same throughput rate. Wear characterization revealed intriguing result: the slipping be-haviour of fluoropolymer coating is impaired by small fractions of PE-mod sticking {{on the surface of}} the coating. Furthermore, several improvements were suggested in order to perfect the measurement facilities. /Kir 1...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, a {{regression}} model was constructed {{to optimize the}} relationships between the void fraction of foamed HDPE/wood-flour composites, the processing conditions (<b>extruder’s</b> <b>die</b> temperature and screw speed rate), and the formulation compositions [chemical foaming agent (CFA) concentration and the moisture content of wood flour] by applying a four-factor central composite design (CCD) statistical approach. Design Expert software was employed to carry out the experimental design, statistical analysis, and numerical optimization. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the model showed that the void fraction of HDPE/wood-flour composites was a strong function of the <b>extruder’s</b> <b>die</b> temperature, the screw speed rate, and the moisture content of wood flour, while independent of the CFA content within the studied range (0 1 %). In addition, the moisture content of wood flour and the extruder’s screw speed rate exhibited significant interaction effect on the void fraction of the foamed composites. The response surface optimization generated using the regression model suggests that HDPE/wood-flour composite foams with the highest void fraction can be achieved {{at the highest levels of}} extruder’s screw speed rate (120 rpm) and moisture content of wood flour (12 %), together with the lowest levels of <b>extruder’s</b> <b>die</b> temperature (170 C) and no chemical foaming agent.

40|$|Starch, as {{a natural}} polymer, can be {{processed}} by techniques such as extrusion into films/sheets, foams, shaped articles, etc. During processing, starch experiences a phase transition (gelatinization/melting) from native granular form to homogeneous molten form, which can be enhanced by shear treatment. The processing rheology of starch melt has {{a close relationship with}} thermomechanical input. Both phase transition and rheology play critical roles in starch processing and can be largely influenced by plasticizer type and content and starch type and structure (amylose/amylopectin ratios). Due to the inherent drawbacks of starch, starch-based blends (e. g., with biodegradable aliphatic polyesters) and (nano) composites (e. g., with cellulose or nanoclays) have been widely examined. The production of high-performance plasticized starch-based materials relies on the facility (<b>extruder,</b> <b>die,</b> takeoff device, etc.), sample preparation and processing strategies (plasticizer addition method, blending sequence, orientation, etc.), and the control of processing conditions (temperature, pressure, shear rate, etc.) ...|$|E

The rapid response of the technique enabled melt temperature within the extruder screw channel to be monitored in real time, allowing quantification of the thermal stability of the extrusion process. Two polyethylenes were used in experiments with three extruder screw geometries at a range of screw speeds. Data generated by the infrared sensor was found to be highly sensitive to thermal fluctuations relating to the melting performance of the extruder screw. Comparisons made with an intrusive thermocouple grid sensor located in the <b>extruder</b> <b>die</b> suggested that the infrared technique was able to provide a similar level of information without disturbing the process flow.

Design/methodology/approach: The capacity of a CNC extruder was calculated and decided as analyzing the FEM results performed by commercial software DEFORM- 2 D. CNC <b>extruder</b> and <b>die</b> set for variable section extrusion was invented by field extrusion experts. Findings: CNC extruder had a key role in variable extrusion process. Furthermore there was few die sets with mold feeding parts for aluminum extrusion. To be capable of extruding aluminum products with variable cross section are CNC <b>extruder</b> and the <b>die</b> set. Research limitations/implications: For future research of developed CNC extruder, frame structures of the extruder would be analyzed and designed using FE analysis. In addition CNC extruder would be operated by the control program for variable section as a PC version. Practical implications: Aluminum parts with variable section would increase as utilizing the CNC extruder and cost price of the parts be down. Many industrial products using the variable section extrusion process would be used in diverse fields. Originality/value: Extruded aluminum part with variable section is rarely used since extruders don’t be designed and developed for variable section extrusion. It is important that an extruder with CNC control, which could be easily handled and have accessible software to be operated by field user, are invented. As stated above, CNC extruder is needed for production of industrial products with variable section for today.

Our results clearly confirm the hypothesis that the flow jumps from one stable branch to the other during oscillations as suggested in the literature. The role of the melt compressibility in the reservoir is also established. The effect of the average mass flow rate imposed by the extruder Q(IN) on the respective compression and decompression phases is in good agreement with the effect predicted by the mass balance in the reservoir.

40|$|Melt {{viscosity}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} factors affecting product quality in extrusion processes particularly with regard to recycled polymers. However, due to wide variability in the physical properties of recycled feedstock, it is difficult to maintain the melt viscosity during extrusion of polymer blends and obtain good quality product without generating scrap. This research investigates the application of ultrasound and temperature control in an automatic extruder controller, which has ability to maintain constant melt viscosity from variable recycled polymer feedstock during extrusion processing. An ultrasonic modulation system has been developed and fitted to the extruder prior to the die to convey ultrasonic energy from a high power ultrasonic generator to the polymer melt. Two separate control loops have been developed to run simultaneously in one controller: the first loop controls the ultrasonic energy or temperature to maintain constant die pressure, the second loop is used to control extruder screw speed to maintain constant throughput at the <b>extruder</b> <b>die.</b> Time response and energy consumption of the control methods in real-time experiments are also investigated and reported this paper...|$|E

In addition, RSM allowed multiresponse optimization of acid casein production using unique and newly developed optimization techniques.

40|$|The ever-growing {{emission}} {{of greenhouse gases}} {{has been a major}} contributor to climate change. Solutions include CO 2 storage and utilisation. Moreover, scarcity of non-renewable resources has driven adoption of biocomposites. Therefore merging CO 2 utilisation with biocomposites was investigated. Combinations of natural fibres and solutions were screened for their CO 2 capture capacity, and chosen for optimisation of reaction pressure, temperature and time using the response surface method (RSM) to maximise CO 2 capture. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to carry out kinetic analysis of isothermal CO 2 capture, using the optimised sorbents. Sorbents were also pyrolised and decomposition temperatures indicated presence of ammonium bicarbonate and carbonate, and sodium bicarbonate, which were also confirmed with FTIR and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Recycled LDPE was compounded with sorbents to make biocomposites, and the effect of sorbent loading and <b>extruder</b> <b>die</b> temperature on their physical properties was modelled with RSM. The densities, yield and ultimate strengths were higher at lower sorbent-loadings and die temperatures, whereas Young’s moduli were higher at higher sorbent-loadings and die temperatures.

40|$|Two {{types of}} polylactic acid (PLA) films (one {{amorphous}} and one semi-crystalline) were produced by sheet extrusion. Talc {{was used as}} a nucleation agent for the semi-crystalline PLA. The films were annealed above their T-g or were uniaxially orientated in two ways: (1) via a drawing system in front of the <b>extruder</b> and <b>die</b> or (2) via a three-roller stretching system. The slower crystallization rate and lower melting stress of the PLA resulted in amorphous film using the drawing system. Annealing above T-g increased crystallinity and polymer chain relaxation, which resulted in increases in both strength and toughness. Stretching above T-g also produced simultaneous crystallization and chain relaxation, which resulted in increases in both modulus and toughness. Both modulus and tensile strength in the stretching direction were higher than in the crosswise direction. Talc acted not only as a rigid filler to reinforce the PLA, but also as a nucleation agent for the PLA, especially during annealing...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{specific}} peel system low-density polyethylene/isotactic poly-butene- 1 (PE-LD/iPB- 1), {{which is}} often used for protective packages, was investi-gated in this study. The required peel force to open the package depends {{on the content of}} iPB- 1 and on the processing conditions of the blowing process. Commer-cial products have a constant amount of iPB- 1. Thus, a defined peel force can be adjusted by varying the processing conditions. The standard peel system PE-LD with 6 wt % iPB- 1 was investigated in dependence on the processing conditions. The most important processing parameters of the processing line (<b>extruder,</b> <b>die</b> head, tube forming area) were varied and their influence on the peel properties was examined. For example the temperatures of the melt within the extruder, the size of the die gap within the die head, and the cooling behavior of the film bubble were investigated. Higher melt temperatures within the extruder decreased the peel force. The investigations also revealed a strong dependence of the peel force {{on the size of the}} die gap and on the degree of cooling. The new developed parameter time of solidification was used to characterize the cooling behavior.

The variations in MFI are due to differences in the source of the recycled material used. The work describes how melt viscosity for specific extruder/die system is calculated in real time using the rheological properties of the materials, the pressure drop through the <b>extruder</b> <b>die</b> and the actual throughput measurements using a gravimetric loss-in-weight hopper feeder.

Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory (U. S. DOE-NETL), to support the development of rapid-setting, ash-based, fiber-incorporated ''green'' building products. Green building materials are a rapidly growing trend in the building and construction industry in the US. A two phase project was implemented wherein Phase I assessed, through chemical and physical testing, ash, ash-based cement and fiber composites exhibiting superior structural performance when applied to the AeRock mixing and extrusion process and involved the conduct of pilot-scale production trials of AeRock products, and wherein Phase II involved the design, construction, and operation of a commercial-scale plant to confirm production issues and to produce panels for performance evaluations. Phase I optimized the composite ingredients including ash-based cement, Class F and Class C DFGD ash, and various fiber reinforcements. Additives, such as retardants and accelerators, were also evaluated as related to extruder performance. The optimized composite from the Phase I effort was characterized by a modulus of rupture (MOR) measured between 1, 931 and 2, 221 psi flexural strength, comparable to other wood and non-wood building materials. Continuous extrusion of the optimum composite in the AeRock pilot-scale facility produced an excellent product that was assembled into a demonstration for exhibit and durability purposes. Finishes, from plain to marbled, from bright reds to muted earth tones and with various textures, could easily be applied during the mixing and extrusion process. The successful pilot-scale demonstration was in turn used to design the production parameters and <b>extruder</b> <b>dies</b> for a commercial scale demonstration at Ultrapanel Pty, Ltd of Ballarat, Australia under Phase II.

Uncompatibilized PBT/ABS 60 / 40 (wt %) and compatibilized PBT/ABS/MMA-GMA with 2 and 5 wt % of MMA-GMA showed refined cocontinuous morphologies at {{the front end of}} the extruder, which coarsened towards the extruder outlet. Coarsening in uncompatibilized PBT/ ABS blends is much more pronounced than in the compatibilized PBT/ABS/MMA-GMA equivalents and decreases with increasing amounts of the MMA-GMA. For both systems, significant refinement on the phase morphology was found to occur after the blends pass through the <b>extruder</b> <b>die.</b> This phenomenon was correlated to the capacity of the die in promoting particles break-up due to the extra elongational stresses developed at the matrix entrance. Injection molding induces coarsening of the ABS domains in the case of uncompatibilized PBT/ABS blends, while the reactive blend kept its refined phase morphology. Therefore, the compatibilization process of PBT/ABS/ MMA-GMA blends take place progressively leading to a further refinement of the phase morphology in the latter steps, owing to the slow reaction rate relative to epoxide functions and the carboxyl/hydroxyl groups...|$|E

A decrease in screw rotation speed also provided improved cocrystal yield due to the material experiencing longer residence times within the process. A partial least squares analysis in this region of NIR spectrum correlated well with PXRD data, providing a best fit with cocrystal conversion when a limited range of process conditions were considered, for example a single set temperature.

Changing the indicated input parameters, spread calculated and produced the dimension of the desired die. A sequence of calculations and AutoCAD diagrams were produced for the specific die requirements. With this information at hand, Sri Lankan industries can start manufacture of the extruder dies for production of plasticized PVC pipes on a good theoretical basis ensuring success, instead importing...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{two-dimensional}} flow simulation in food <b>extruder</b> <b>die</b> for intermeshing co-rotating twin-screw extruder were performed by solving Navier-Stokes equation and continuity equation for non-Newtonian fluid using finite element computer package, ANSYS/FLOTRAN. The {{objective of the}} study is to determine the nature of flow, heat and pressure distribution in the die and to determine the effect of screw speed on process parameters such as temperature, pressure and flow rate in the die. Four different die geometries were used. The levels of temperature considered were 120, 140, 160 and 180 0 C. The screw speeds (taken as inlet velocity for the die) were 120, 160, 200 and 240 rpm. The results are presented for the flow profile, pressure distribution, temperature distribution and flow rate. For all the velocities considered, temperature has no significant effect on the velocity vector. The flow rate increases with increase in inlet velocity. Extruder throughput has a significant effect on the flow rate as reflected in higher flow rate recorded for increased throughput. Dough temperature has no effect on flow rate within the temperature range of 120 0 C to 180 0 C. The temperature of the dough decreases as it flows through the die. The values of temperature obtained for die exit temperature by simulation and experiment compare favorably. This shows that the simulation procedure employed is reliable enough to accurately predict the temperature of the dough at any point in the di...|$|E
40|$|A twin-screw {{extruder}} and a rotational rheometer {{were used}} to generate shear forces in concentrated gelatin inoculated with a heat-resistant isolate of a vegetative bacterial species, Microbacterium lacticum. Shear forces in the extruder were mainly controlled by varying the water feed rate. The water content of the extrudates changed between 19 and 45 % (wet weight basis). Higher shear forces generated at low water contents and the calculated die wall shear stress correlated strongly with bacterial destruction. No surviving microorganisms could be detected at the highest wall shear stress of 409 kPa, giving log reduction of 5. 3 (minimum detection level, 2 × 104 CFU/sample). The mean residence time of the microorganism in the extruder was 49 to 58 s, and the maximum temperature measured {{in the end of}} the die was 73 °C. The D 75 °C of the microorganism in gelatin at 65 % water content was 20 min. It is concluded that the physical forces generated in the reverse screw element and the <b>extruder</b> <b>die</b> rather than heat played a major part in cell destruction. In a rotational rheometer, after shearing of a mix of microorganisms with gelatin at 65 % (wt/wt) moisture content for 4 min at a shear stress of 2. 8 kPa and a temperature of 75 °C, the number of surviving microorganisms in the sheared sample was 5. 2 × 106 CFU/g of sample compared with 1. 4 × 108 CFU/g of sample in the nonsheared control. The relative effectiveness of physical forces in the killing of bacteria and destruction of starch granules is discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAt present, wood {{particles}} (wood flour) with a low {{aspect ratio}} are mostly used as fillers in wood-plastic composites (WPC). Reinforcement of WPC and improved strength properties may {{be achieved by}} using real wood fibres with a high aspect ratio. WPC based on 70 % (wt.) refiner (TMP) wood fibres and mechanically processed hemp fibres were extruded in a two-step process. Eleven compounds based on the two natural fibre types were prepared using a thermokinetic mixer and extruded in a conical, counter-rotating twin-screw extruder. Additional formulation components were polypropylene fibres, maleic anhydride-modified polypropylene (MAPP) and lubricant. It was determined that compounding in a thermokinetic mixer is a useful step for processing of WPC with refiner and hemp fibres as little fibre damage occurred. However, during extrusion, both natural fibre types were severely shortened due to strong shear forces, and homogeneous dispersion of fibres in the matrix was not achieved. WPC based on hemp fibres displayed the best strength properties of the formulations tested. Current <b>extruder</b> screw and <b>die</b> configurations need to be modified to achieve improved fibre reinforcement and to create new, structurally demanding applications for WPC...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the retention of flavour volatiles encapsulated in water-insoluble systems during high temperature–short time extrusion process. A protein precipitation method was used to produce water-insoluble capsules encapsulating limonene, and the capsules were added to the extruder feed material (cornstarch). A twin-screw extruder was used to evaluate the effect of capsule level of addition (0 – 5 %), barrel temperature (125 – 145 °C) and screw speed (145 – 175 r. p. m.) on <b>extruder</b> parameters (torque, <b>die</b> pressure, specific mechanical energy, residence time distribution) and extrudate properties [flavour retention, texture, colour, density, expansion, water absorption index, water solubility index (WSI) ]. Capsule level had a significant effect on extrusion conditions, flavour retention and extrudate physical properties. Flavour retention increased with the increase in capsule level from 0 % to 2. 5 %, reached a maximum value at capsule level of 2. 5 % and decreased when the capsule level increased from 2. 5 % to 5 %. The die pressure, torque, expansion ratio, hardness and WSI exhibited the opposite effect with the presence of capsules...|$|R
40|$|The {{extrusion}} of polymer melts {{is often}} rate {{limited by the}} onset of an elastic surface instability known as sharkskin. Appearance of these surface distortions is generally unacceptable for commercial applications. The desire to forestall the onset of sharkskin to higher output rates has motivated {{a considerable amount of}} research to characterize the nature of the instability. In this manuscript, we will present a series of detailed experiments using a custom fabricated <b>extruder</b> and <b>die.</b> By incorporating thermal breaks and precise localized temperature control of the die and barrel, predetermined temperature gradients could be induced across the extrudate. Polymers are typically very poor thermal conductors, and therefore the effects of heating or cooling from a boundary can be designed to only affect the properties of the extrudate very close to the die wall. We will present data correlating the amplitude and frequency of the sharkskin instability to the bulk and die surface temperature as well as the shear rates. The result is a quantitative processing map that characterizes the instability and demonstrates that by modifying the rheology of the polymeric fluid very near the die exit corner, it is possible to suppress or control the sharkskin instability through isolated die heating or cooling. By reformulating our data into Weissenberg and Deborah numbers using the relaxation time evaluated at the wall temperature, we demonstrate that the sharkskin surface instability is dependent only on flow kinematics and viscometric properties of the fluid very near the die wall, a result of the stress singularity present at the die exit, and independent of bulk fluid properties. This technique could conceivably increase the profitability of extrusion processes and be extended to develop precisely-controlled sharkskin for designing specific functionality into extruded surfaces...|$|R
