40|$|Measurements of {{the total}} ozone content of the atmosphere, made with seven ground based {{instruments}} at a site near Wallops Island, Virginia, are discussed in terms for serving as control values with which the rocketborne sensor data products can be compared. These products are profiles of O 3 concentration with altitude. By integrating over the range of altitudes from the surface to the rocket apogee and by appropriately estimating the residual ozone amount from apogee {{to the top of}} the atmosphere, a total ozone amount can be computed from the profiles that can be directly compared with the ground based instrumentation results. <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometers</b> were used for two of the ground-based instruments.

Results from the TOMS/Dobson instrument comparisons through 1990 have been presented by McPeters and Komhyr (1991). <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> 83 was established as the standard instrument for the U. S. A. Dobson instrument station network in 1962. In 1980, the instrument was designated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) as the Standard <b>Dobson</b> <b>Spectrophotometer</b> for the World. Long-term ozone measurement precision of the instrument has been maintained at plus or minus 0. 5 percent (Komhyr et al., 1989). On an absolute scale, the ozone measurement accuracy of the instrument is estimated to plus or minus 3 percent. In early April, 1990, comparison of total ozone and vertical distribution (Umkehr) observations were made {{for the first time}} with <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> 8. 3. The work was conducted at the NOAA Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) in Boulder, Colorado, and at the research and instrument manufacturing facility of the Ball Aerospace System Division located about 2 km east of Boulder. (The SBUV- 2 S/N- 2 instrument, built by Ball Aerospace Systems Division, is scheduled for launch aboard the NOAA- 13 satellite).

50|$|<b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometers</b> {{can be used}} {{to measure}} both total column ozone and {{profiles}} of ozone in the atmosphere. Ozone is tri-atomic oxygen, O3; ozone molecules absorb harmful UV light in the atmosphere before it reaches the surface of the earth. No UVC radiation penetrates to the ground as it is absorbed in the ozone-oxygen cycle. However some longer-wave and less harmful UVB and most of the UVA is not absorbed as ozone is less opaque to these frequencies, so they penetrate to the ground level of Earth in higher quantities. The sources of light used may vary. Beside the direct sun light, the light from the clear sky, moon or stars may be used.|$|R

40|$|Determinations {{of global}} total ozone amounts {{have been made}} from {{recently}} reprocessed measurements with the SBUV/ 2 on the NOAA- 11 environmental satellite since January 1989.

The SBUV/ 2 data set discussed here traces the Northern Hemisphere total ozone from 1989 to the present, showing a marked decrease from the average of those years starting in the summer of 1992 and continuing into 1993, with an apparent returning to more normal levels in late 1993...|$|R
40|$|A global {{ozone data}} set {{covering}} {{the two years}} from November 1978 until October 1980, {{with an average of}} 1200 profiles per day, has been produced and archived from the solar backscattered ultraviolet (SBUV) instrument flown on the NIMBUS 7 spacecraft. The SBUV ozone profiles are compared with measurements from chemical and optical sensors launched on balloons and rockets and with ozone profiles obtained from the ground-based <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometers</b> using the Umkehr method. The biases between the SBUV results and the balloon and Umkehr results are generally less than 10 percent. These biases are functions of layer height and latitude and are believed to be largely due to inconsistencies in the ozone absorption cross sections used for the various measurement systems. The precision of the SBUV measurements is found to be better than 8 percent for pressures between 1 and 64 mbar and better than 15 percent from 64 to 253 mbar...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{ozone layer}} is under threat due to warming in the {{troposphere}} {{brought about by}} the increase in greenhouse gases (GHG) concentrations. Warming in the troposphere makes the stratosphere cooler, producing polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) that support chemical reactions that produce active chlorine which destroys ozone. Ozone measurements and analyses with different instrument platforms (satellite-borne and ground-based) must still be performed as they remain essential even with the signing of the Montréal Protocol. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) contributes to the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) Program of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) [2006 - 2013] by measuring daily total ozone column using a <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer.</b> Maximum amount of ozone was observed during the northern hemisphere summer period and minimum throughout the northern hemisphere winter due to unequal solar radiation which is a factor for ozone production. The differences between satellite-borne and ground-based ozone measuring instruments were investigated and it was found out that the measurements vary due to local weather events, solar zenith angle, sky conditions, and the relatively large footprint of the satellites. Comparing the ground-based <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> and the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) instrument on-board the ENVISAT satellite yielded a correlation coefficient and a root-mean-squar...|$|E

Maximum ozone concentrations occur during local spring (September-October), and minimum concentrations during late autumn (April-May); the seasonal variation {{is much larger}} in the troposphere than in the stratosphere. If there were no seasonal variation in the stratosphere, the seasonal variation observed in the troposphere alone would be sufficient to drive a total ozone column variation of about 5 percent.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the susceptibility of the <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> No. 118 to stray light interference. In this regard, {{a series of}} total ozone content measurements were carried out in Athens, Greece for air-mass values (μ) extending up to μ = 5. The monochromatic-heterochromatic stray light derived by Basher's model was used in order to evaluate the specific instrumental parameters which determine if this instrument suffers from this problem or not. The results obtained indicate that the measurements made by the Dobson instrument of the Athens station for air mass values up to 2. 5, underestimates the total ozone content by 3. 5 DU in average, or about 1 % of the station's mean total ozone content (TOC). The comparison {{of the values of}} the same parameters measured 15 years ago with the present ones indicates the good maintenance of the <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> No. 118. This fact is of crucial importance because the variability of the daily total ozone observations collected by the Athens Dobson Station since 1989 has proved to be representative to the variability of the mean total ozone observed over the whole mid-latitude zone of the Northern Hemisphere. This stresses the point that the Athens total ozone station, being the unique Dobson station in south-eastern Europe, may be assumed as a ground truth station for the reliable conversion of the satellite radiance observations to total ozone measurements...|$|E
40|$|NOAA’s {{program of}} long term {{monitoring}} of the vertical distribution of ozone with Electrochemical Concentration Cell (ECC) ozonesondes has undergone a number of changes over the 50 year record. In order to produce a homogenous data set, these changes must be documented and where necessary, appropriate corrections applied. This is the first comprehensive and consistent reprocessing of NOAA’s ozonesonde data records that corrects for these changes using the rawest form of the data (cell current and pump temperature) in native resolution {{as well as a}} point by point uncertainty calculation that is unique to each sounding. The reprocessing is carried out uniformly at all eight ozonesonde sites in NOAA’s network with differences in sensing solution and ozonesonde types accounted for in the same way at all sites. The corrections used to homogenize the NOAA ozonesonde data records greatly improve the ozonesonde measurements with an average one sigma uncertainty of ± 4 – 6  % in the stratosphere and ± 5 – 20  % in the troposphere. A comparison of the integrated column ozone from the ozonesonde profile with co-located <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometers</b> total column ozone measurements shows agreement within ± 5  % for >  70  % of the profiles.

40|$|The Nimbus- 7 and Earth Probe Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data {{as well as}} SBUV and SBUV/ 2 {{data have}} been {{reprocessed}} with a new retrieval algorithm (Version 8) and an updated calibration procedure. An overview will be presented systematically comparing ozone values to an ensemble of Brewer and <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometers.</b> The comparisons were made {{as a function of}} latitude, solar zenith angle, reflectivity and total ozone. Results show that the accuracy of the TOMS retrieval has been improved when aerosols are present in the atmosphere, when snow/ice and sea glint are present, and when ozone in the northern hemisphere is extremely low. TOMS overpass data are derived from the single TOMS best match measurement, almost always located within one degree of the ground station and usually made within an hour of local noon. The Version 8 Earth Probe TOMS ozone values have decreased by an average of about 1 % due to a much better understanding of the calibration of the instrument. N- 7 SBUV as well as the series of NOAA SBUV/ 2 column ozone values have also been processed with the Version 8 algorithm and have been compared to values from an ensemble of groundstations.

40|$|The {{total ozone}} {{variations}} over Europe (~ 50 ° N) {{in the period}} 1964 – 2004 are analyzed for detection of signals of ozone recovery. The ozone deviations from the long-term monthly means (1964 – 1980) for selected European stations, where the ozone observations (by the <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometers)</b> {{have been carried out}} continuously for at least 3 – 4 decades, are averaged and examined by a regression model. A new method is proposed to disclose both the ozone trend variations and date of the trend turnaround. The regression model contains a piecewise linear trend component and the terms describing the ozone response to forcing by "natural" changes in the atmosphere. Standard proxies for the dynamically driven ozone variations are used. The Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) methodology and principal component analysis are used to find an optimal set of the explanatory variables and the trend pattern. The turnaround of the ozone trend in 1994 is suggested from the pattern of the piecewise linear trend component. Thus, the changes in the ozone mean level are calculated over the periods 1970 – 1994 and 1994 – 2003, for both the original time series and the time series having "natural" variations removed. Statistical significance of the changes are derived by bootstrapping. A first stage of recovery (according to the definition of the International Ozone Commission), i. e. lessening of a negative trend, is found over Europe. It seems possible that the increase in the ozone mean level since 1994 of about 1 – 2 % is due to superposition of the "natural" processes. Comparison of the total ozone ground-based network (the <b>Dobson</b> and Brewer <b>spectrophotometers)</b> and the satellite (TOMS, version 8) data over Europe shows the small bias in the mean values for the period 1996 – 2004, but the differences between the daily ozone values from these instruments are not trendless, and this may hamper an identification of the next stage of the ozone recovery over Europe.
