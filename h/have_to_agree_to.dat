25|$|After the 1985 season, the White Sox {{came close}} to trading Fisk to the New York Yankees for {{designated}} hitter Don Baylor. Baylor was unhappy with the Yankees since he did not play every day as he wanted (despite being the team's regular DH) and asked to be traded. The potential deal was complicated in that the White Sox would have to re-sign Fisk, a free agent, and that both players would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> the trade. Negotiations between the two teams ended when {{they were unable to}} reach an agreement. The White Sox re-signed Fisk, who remained with the club until the end of his career. During spring training in 1986, the Yankees traded Baylor to the Boston Red Sox for designated hitter Mike Easler.|$|E
25|$|The CAP {{has always}} been a {{difficult}} area of EU policy to reform; it is a problem that began in the 1960s and one that has continued to the present, albeit less severely. Changes to the CAP are proposed by the European Commission, after a public consultation, which then sends its proposals to the Council and to the European Parliament. Both the Council and the European Parliament <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> any changes. The Parliament was involved in the process of change {{for the first time in}} 2013. The involvement of the Parliament, which represents the citizens, increases the democratic legitimacy of the CAP. Outside Brussels proper, the farming lobby's power has been a factor determining EU agricultural policy since the earliest days of integration.|$|E

25|$|The Munich Agreement of 1938 did {{not last}} for long. In March 1939 the German {{occupation}} of Czechoslovakia began with the invasion of Bohemia and Moravia, leaving Slovakia as a German puppet state. Lithuania was forced {{to give up its}} Klaipėda Region (Memelland). Formal demands were made for the return of the Free City of Danzig to Germany, even though its status was guaranteed by the League of Nations. In early 1939 Hitler proposed Poland an alliance on German terms, with an expectation of compliance. The Polish government would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> Danzig's incorporation by the Reich and to an extraterritorial highway passage connecting East Prussia with the rest of Germany through the so-called Polish Corridor (an area linking the Polish mainland with the Baltic Sea). Poland would join an anti-Soviet alliance and coordinate its foreign policy with Germany, thus becoming a client state. The independence-minded Polish government was alarmed and a British guarantee of Poland's independence was issued on 31 March 1939. Reacting to this act and to Poland's effective rejection of the German demands, Hitler renounced the existing German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact on April 28.|$|E
500|$|As the {{negotiations}} continued into 1996, a panel appointed by Houston mayor Bob Lanier reported that {{building a new}} arena was [...] "essential to keep pro sports in Houston". After Watson rejected a contract buyout proposal of $30 million, the Rockets filed a legal challenge against their lease, stating the [...] "need {{to be able to}} buy out" [...] of the lease. However, the city of Houston filed a counterclaim to force the Rockets to stay at the Summit, saying that if the Rockets did not honor their contract, then they might [...] "have no incentive to honor any new agreement with the city of Houston to play in a new downtown sports arena". The validity of the lease was eventually upheld, and in April 1997, Lanier announced that the Rockets and Watson would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> share control of the new arena equally, or lose access to it altogether. After both parties agreed to the terms, a bill that authorized increased taxes to pay for a new arena was signed into law in July, by then-Governor George W. Bush.|$|E

[...] The paperwork for the plea agreement was to be finalized in March 2000 for the former Ford Motor Company employee {{to plead guilty to}} one count of federal gambling and one count of income tax evasion. [...] He and his son, Carlton, backed out in May 2000, preferring to take their chances at trial due to the likelihood of light punishment for first-time offenders. [...] Under the plea agreement in which they would have forfeited $100,000 and faced 615 months in prison, they {{would have been able to}} keep their homes.

William <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> three important principles before Llywelyn would release him. Firstly, William was to pay a ransom of £2,000, “a sum corresponding so precisely to that which Llywelyn <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay the king that it is reasonable to conjecture that the prince meant the one liability to discharge the other," [...] according to J.E. Lloyd. William de Braose then <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> never take up arms against Llywelyn ever again. [...] Lastly, William <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> arrange the marriage between his eldest daughter and co-heiress Isabella, with the lordship and castle of Builth as her marriage dowry, to Dafydd, Llywelyn’s heir.

2500|$|Jaffe {{eventually}} set {{three conditions}} for the casting of Brando: That {{he would have to}} take a fee far below what he typically received; he'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> accept financial responsibility for any production delays his behavior cost; and he had to submit to a screen test. Coppola convinced Brando to a videotaped [...] "make-up" [...] test, in which Brando did his own makeup (he used cotton balls to simulate the character's puffed cheeks). Coppola had feared Brando might be too young to play the Don, but was electrified by the actor's characterization as the head of a crime family. Even so, he had to fight the studio in order to cast the temperamental actor. Brando had doubts himself, stating in his autobiography, [...] "I had never played an Italian before, and I didn't think I could do it successfully." [...] Eventually, Charles Bluhdorn, the president of Paramount parent Gulf+Western, was won over to letting Brando have the role; when he saw the screen test, he asked in amazement, [...] "What are we watching? Who is this old guinea?" [...] Brando was signed for a low fee of $50,000, but in his contract, he was given a percentage of the gross on a sliding scale: 1% of the gross for each $10million over a $10million threshold, up to 5% if the picture exceeded $60million. According to Evans, Brando sold back his points in the picture for $100,000, as he was in dire need of funds. [...] "That $100,000 cost him $11million," [...] Evans claimed.|$|E

He supposed he was overjoyed, but he missed the feeling of elation which he had experienced some four months ago when he had bagged a snow-leopard with a lucky shot after a day’s fruitless stalking.
