5|$|The {{nature of}} {{agricultural}} production {{was determined by}} the land and climate. The cold and wet climate meant that more oats and barley were grown than corn. The evidence of bones indicates that cattle were by far the most important domesticated animal, followed by pigs, sheep and goats, while domesticated fowl were very rare. Bone evidence indicates that there was a significant growth in the <b>fish</b> <b>trade</b> around 1000. This increased marine exploitation of the Highlands and Islands may have been {{as a result of the}} arrival of Scandinavian settlers in this period.|$|E
5|$|A. ocellatus is {{native to}} Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, and French Guiana, and occurs in the Amazon River basin, along the Amazon, Içá, Negro, Solimões, and Ucayali River systems, {{and also in the}} Approuague and Oyapock River drainages. In its natural environment, the species {{typically}} occurs in slow-moving white-water habitats, and has been observed sheltering under submerged branches. Feral populations also occur in China, northern Australia, and Florida, USA as a byproduct of the ornamental <b>fish</b> <b>trade.</b> The species is limited in its distribution by its intolerance of cooler water temperatures, the lower lethal limit for the species is 12.9°C (55.22°F).|$|E

Another wave of Norse settlement along the coast of Finnmark province is triggered by the <b>fish</b> <b>trade</b> in the 14th century. However, these highly specialized fishing communities made little impact on the Sami lifestyle, and in the late Middle Ages, the two communities could exist alongside each other with little contact except occasional trading.|$|E

25|$|The {{well-known}} red-tailed black shark (Epalzeorhynchos bicolor) {{from the}} Mae Klong river of The Bridge on the River Kwai fame possibly only survives in captivity. Ironically, while pollution {{and other forms}} of overuse by humans have driven it from its native home, it is bred for the aquarium <b>fish</b> <b>trade</b> by the thousands. The Yarqon bleak (Acanthobrama telavivensis) from the Yarqon River had to be rescued into captivity from imminent extinction; new populations have apparently been established again successfully from captive stock. Balitoridae and Cobitidae, meanwhile, contain {{a very large number of}} species about which essentially nothing is known except how they look and where they were first found.|$|E
25|$|Live food {{fish are}} often transported in tanks at high expense for an {{international}} market that prefers its seafood killed immediately before it is cooked. This process originally was started by Lindeye. Delivery of live fish without water is also being explored. While some seafood restaurants keep live fish in aquaria for display purposes or for cultural beliefs, the majority of live fish are kept for dining customers. The live food <b>fish</b> <b>trade</b> in Hong Kong, for example, is estimated to have driven imports of live food fish to more than 15,000 tonnes in 2000. Worldwide sales that year were estimated at US$400million, according to the World Resources Institute.|$|E
25|$|Cod {{has been}} an {{important}} economic commodity in international markets since the Viking period (around 800 AD). Norwegians traveled with dried cod and soon a dried cod market developed in southern Europe. This market has lasted for more than 1,000 years, enduring the Black Death, wars and other crises, and is still an important Norwegian <b>fish</b> <b>trade.</b> The Portuguese began fishing cod in the 15th century. Clipfish is widely enjoyed in Portugal. The Basques {{played an important role in}} the cod trade, and allegedly found the Canadian fishing banks before Columbus' discovery of America. The North American east coast developed in part due to the vast cod stocks. Many cities in the New England area are located near cod fishing grounds. The fish was so important to the history and development of Massachusetts, the state's House of Representatives hung a wood carving of a codfish, known as the Sacred Cod of Massachusetts, in its chambers.|$|E

25|$|The Adyar river {{originates}} from Malaipattu tank near Manimangalam {{village in}} Sriperumbudur Taluk at about 15km west of Tambaram and gains momentum as a stream from Chembarambakkam lake. It runs through Chennai for 42km before draining into the Bay of Bengal, forming an estuary, which {{extends from the}} Adyar Bridge to the sandbar {{at the edge of}} the sea, with some small islets in-between. Just before joining the sea at a sand bar on the shore, one part of the river takes off northward beyond the Chettinad Palace as a small inlet of water forming a tidal creek. The creek takes a U-turn near Foreshore Estate. It surrounds what was formerly called Quibble Island, stopping short of completely encircling it. The estuary covers an area of about 300 acres. The low salinity, good shelters, calm conditions and high plankton availability in the creek serves as a good nursery for fish. The flow of tidal water in and out of the creek allowed for easy travel of boats. It therefore encouraged fishing and there was a thriving economy of <b>fish</b> <b>trade</b> here. However, with the city's sewage and effluence from its various industries, for some time, emptying into the river, the biological activities in the region was affected.|$|E
25|$|In {{a recent}} {{interpretation}} of the Dieppe maps, Professor Gayle K. Brunelle of California State University argued that the Dieppe school of cartographers {{should be seen as}} acting as propagandists for French geographic knowledge and territorial claims. The decades from about 1535 to 1562 when the Dieppe school of cartographers flourished were also the period in which French trade with the New World was at its 16th-century height, in terms of the North Atlantic <b>fish</b> <b>trade,</b> the fur trade, and, most important for the cartographers, the rivalry with the Portuguese for control of the coasts of Brazil and the supplies of lucrative brazilwood. The bright red dye produced from brazilwood replaced woad as the primary dyestuff in the cloth industry in France and the Low Countries. The Dieppe cartographers used the skills and geographic knowledge of Portuguese mariners, pilots and geographers working in France to produce maps meant to emphasize French interests in and dominion over territory in the New World that the Portuguese also claimed, both in Newfoundland and in Brazil. Brunelle noted that, in design and decorative style the Dieppe maps represented a blending of the latest knowledge circulating in Europe with older visions of world geography deriving from Ptolemy and mediaeval cartographers and explorers such as Marco Polo. Renaissance mapmakers such as those based in Dieppe relied heavily on each other's work, as well as on maps from previous generations, and thus their maps represented a mixture of old and new information often coexisting uneasily in the same map.|$|E
500|$|In 1814 the Royal Dockyard was {{transferred}} to Pembroke Dock; though, when Robert Fulke Greville inherited the estate in 1824, a commercial dock was started which became {{the home of a}} successful fishing industry. By 1849, the district of Hakin was described as a considerable centre of boat building, and by 1906, Milford had become the sixth largest fishing port in the UK, and its population rose. [...] The Pembrokeshire Herald claimed in 1912 that [...] "the <b>fish</b> <b>trade</b> is Milford's sole industry....the population of the town has doubled by means of it".|$|E

500|$|Both fried {{fish and}} fried chipped {{potatoes}} are of Victorian origin. The Fish Trades Gazette of 29 July 1922 stated that [...] "Later there was introduced {{into this country}} the frying and purveying of chip potatoes from France... which had made the fried <b>fish</b> <b>trade</b> what it is today." [...] The Times recorded that [...] "potatoes chipped and fried in the French manner were introduced in Lancashire with great success about 1871." [...] Fish and chip shops in the 1920s were often run by Jews or Italians. A slightly earlier date is available for chips in London, however, as Dickens's 1859 A Tale of Two Cities mentions [...] "husky chips of potatoes, fried with some reluctant drops of oil".|$|E
2500|$|The Cyprinidae in {{particular}} are important {{in a variety of}} ways. Many species are important food fish, particularly in Europe and Asia.

2500|$|In late 1974, {{the fishing}} {{enterprise}} Protéine, owned by former president and Saad opponent Chamoun, attempted to streamline fishing off of Sidon's coast, and monopolize the <b>fish</b> <b>trade</b> there.

Pressured by his popular base, Saad organized {{a general strike}} and large demonstrations against Protéine's announced move on 26 February 1975.

2500|$|There {{are several}} disused sidings {{on the beach}} at Dungeness. These were used by {{fishermen}} to help move their hauls across the shingle. This joint provision was to allow transport of fish from Dungeness to Hythe and there to transfer it to road. The company had four-wheel fish wagons, stencilled [...] "Fish Only". The service was developed from 1937 following closure of the South Eastern Railway's Dungeness line that year. The <b>fish</b> <b>trade</b> developed in a small way and was withdrawn. Two such sidings are still in place but are both in a very poor state of repair although they were used by fishermen to transport fish across the beach for many years after the main railway service was withdrawn.|$|E

The North American east coast developed in part due to the vast amount of cod, and many cities in the New England area spawned near cod fishing grounds. [...] New England profited greatly from the golden trade route between England, Africa, the West Indies, and New England in the 17th and 18th centuries. [...] New England cod went to England and then to the West Indies to feed slaves working in the sugar cane fields producing molasses for rum manufacture in Massachusetts and England to be used as payment for more slaves from West African slave traders to be used in the ever expanding sugar cane fields in the West Indies.|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} greater game than this. There was Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle himself, in the odour of Circumlocution--with the very smell of Despatch-Boxes upon him.

That was, in other words, that this great statesman was always yet to be told that it behoved the Pilot of the ship to do anything but prosper in the private loaf and <b>fish</b> <b>trade</b> ashore, the crew being able, by dint of hard pumping, to keep the ship above water without him. On this sublime discovery in the great art How not to do it, Lord Decimus had long sustained the highest glory of the Barnacle family; and let any ill-advised member of either House but try How to do it by bringing in a Bill to do it, that Bill was as good as dead and buried when Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle rose up in his place and solemnly said, soaring into indignant majesty as the Circumlocution cheering soared around him, that he was yet to be told, My Lords, that it behoved him as the Minister of this free country, to set bounds to the philanthropy, to cramp the charity, to fetter the public spirit, to contract the enterprise, to damp the independent self-reliance, of its people.
