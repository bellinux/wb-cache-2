500|$|Brain-computer {{interfaces}} (BCIs) are {{a developing}} technology that clinicians hope {{will one day}} bring more independence and agency to the severely physically disabled. Those the technology {{has the potential to}} help include people with near-total or total paralysis, such as those with tetraplegia (quadriplegia) or advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); BCIs are intended to help them to communicate or even move objects such as motorized wheelchairs, neuroprostheses, or robotic grasping tools. Few of these technologies are currently in regular use by people with disabilities, but a diverse array are in development at an experimental level. One type of BCI uses event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the mu wave in order to control the computer. This method of monitoring brain activity takes advantage of the fact that when a group of neurons is at rest they tend to fire in synchrony with each other. When a participant is cued to imagine movement (an [...] "event"), the resulting desynchronization (the group of neurons that was firing in synchronous waves now firing in complex and individualized patterns) can be reliably detected and analyzed by a computer. Users of such an interface are trained in visualizing movements, typically of the foot, hand, and/or tongue, which are each in different locations on the cortical homunculus and thus distinguishable by an electroencephalograph (EEG) or <b>electrocorticograph</b> (ECoG) recording of electrical activity over the motor cortex. In this method, computers monitor for a typical pattern of mu wave ERD contralateral to the visualized movement combined with event-related synchronization (ERS) in the surrounding tissue. This paired pattern intensifies with training, and the training increasingly takes the form of games, some of which utilize virtual reality. Some researchers have found that the feedback from virtual reality games is particularly effective in giving the user tools to improve control of his or her mu wave patterns. The ERD method can be combined with one or more other methods of monitoring the brain's electrical activity to create hybrid BCIs, which often offer more flexibility than a BCI that uses any single monitoring method.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{present the}} case of a patient with {{epilepsy}} arising from cortical dysplasia in his precentral gyrus. The lesion was resected {{based on the results of}} video-ECoG (<b>electrocorticograph)</b> monitoring and electrical cortical stimulation. The patient has been seizure-free for 1 year since operation, and no neurological deficits have been observed. We discuss possible mechanisms of cortical reorganization in this patient and the features of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) IIb in eloquent cortices...|$|E

Bradycardia during exposure to CO 2 is associated with nociception and pain. However, it is unclear if bradycardia occurs before loss of consciousness as definitions of loss of consciousness vary in the literature. The objectives of this study were to explore the relationship between recumbency, loss of righting reflex (LORR) and a quiescent electromyograph as measures of loss of consciousness, and identify the onset of bradycardia in relation to these measures. Our primary hypothesis was that CO 2 exposure would result in bradycardia, which would precede LORR. Thirty-two adult, female Sprague-Dawley rats were instrumented with a telemetry device and {{randomly assigned to one of}} four killing methods (concentrations of 100 % CO 2, CO 2 (70 %) /O 2 (30 %), isoflurane (5 %) and intraperitoneal pentobarbital (200 mg/kg). Time to achieve recumbency, LORR, quiescent electromyograph, isoelectric <b>electrocorticograph,</b> heart rate and apnea were recorded. The general order of progression was recumbency, LORR, quiescent electromyograph, isoelectric <b>electrocorticograph</b> and apnea. Recumbency preceded LORR in the majority of animals (CO 2; 7 / 8, CO 2 /O 2; 8 / 8, isoflurane; 5 / 8, pentobarbital; 4 / 8). Bradycardia occurred before recumbency in the CO 2 (p = 0. 0002) and CO 2 /O 2 (p = 0. 005) groups, with a 50 % reduction in heart rate compared to baseline. The slowest (time to apnea) and least consistent killing methods were CO 2 /O 2 (1180 Â± 658. 1 s) and pentobarbital (875 [239 to 4680]s). Bradycardia, and consequently nociception and pain, occurs before loss of consciousness during CO 2 exposure. Pentobarbital displayed an unexpected lack of consistency, questioning its classification as an acceptable euthanasia method in rats...|$|E
