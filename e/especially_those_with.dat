5|$|Several cultivars of P.atriplicifolia {{have been}} developed. They are {{primarily}} distinguished by {{the height of}} mature plants {{and the depth of}} the leaf-margin incisions. Many of these cultivars, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> deeply incised leaves, may actually be hybrids of P.atriplicifolia and P.abrotanoides. In that context, some may be referred to by the hybrid name P. ×hybrida.|$|E

5|$|Diamonds occur {{most often}} as {{euhedral}} or rounded octahedra and twinned octahedra known as macles. As diamond's crystal structure has a cubic {{arrangement of the}} atoms, they have many facets that belong to a cube, octahedron, rhombicosidodecahedron, tetrakis hexahedron or disdyakis dodecahedron. The crystals can have rounded off and unexpressive edges and can be elongated. Diamonds (<b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> rounded crystal faces) are commonly found coated in nyf, an opaque gum-like skin.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{construction}} {{began to}} widen I-94/I-69 approaching the Blue Water Bridge, a project completed in 2012. The widening project added dedicated lanes for local traffic and for Blue Water Bridge traffic {{with a new}} permanent welcome center expected to open in 2015, replacing the temporary one near Capac. The lane configuration changes have confused drivers in the area, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> outdated GPS devices, a problem first noted as the department was preparing to reopen the freeway in October 2012. As a result, MDOT installed updated signs complete with American and Canadian flags to help prevent drivers from heading to Canada by mistake.|$|E
5|$|Like the lanthanides, all {{actinides}} {{are highly}} reactive with halogens and chalcogens; however, the actinides react more easily. Actinides, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> {{a small number}} of 5f-electrons, are prone to hybridization. This is explained by the similarity of the electron energies at the 5f, 7s and 6d shells. Most actinides exhibit a larger variety of valence states, and the most stable are +6 for uranium, +5 for protactinium and neptunium, +4 for thorium and plutonium and +3 for actinium and other actinides.|$|E

5|$|There {{are certain}} distributions, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> {{three or more}} parameters, whose likelihoods may become {{infinite}} along certain paths in the parameter space. Using maximum likelihood to estimate these parameters often breaks down, with one parameter tending to the specific value that causes the likelihood to be infinite, rendering the other parameters inconsistent. The method of maximum spacings, however, being dependent on the difference between points on the cumulative distribution function and not individual likelihood points, does not have this issue, and will return valid results over a much wider array of distributions.|$|E
5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} of Miniature Schnauzers {{at a little}} over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, {{which can be treated}} with a variety of methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> uncropped ears; ear examinations {{should be part of the}} regular annual check up. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.|$|E
