50|$|A Buchan Trap (alternative names: Bristol {{interceptor}}, interceptor {{trap and}} disconnecting trap) is a device made from fireclay {{located in a}} <b>domestic</b> <b>sewer</b> pipe to prevent vermin entering the pipe. The trap uses a water seal to prevent rats and mice climbing any further along the pipe. Waste flows from the house through a U-bend in the trap. This {{means that there is}} always water in the pipe preventing the passage of anything from the other direction. The device is a large clay U-bend with air-inlets and vents at the top. It is located below the ground level, but can be accessed through the air-inlet and a rodding hole. This hole allows drain rods to unblock anything located {{at the bottom of the}} U-bend.|$|E

There are three sources of TDS in the western sewer system; trade waste inputs (industrial processing and neutralisation), domestic inputs and infiltration from groundwater sources. This paper presents {{an investigation of the}} TDS characteristics for the influent at WTP and of a sample of domestic wastewater catchment from a residential sewer. The average flow-weighted TDS concentration at WTP was 913 mg/L and average flowweighted TDS concentration in the <b>domestic</b> <b>sewer</b> line was 319 mg/L. The average total load calculated at WTP was determined to be 444 tonnes/day but it was estimated that the TDS load at WTP from City West Water residential customers was only about 37 tonnes/day.

With this aim, the method Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL), from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), was applied. The results revealed that the Ammonia loads increased progressively through the Atibaia River, especially due to the point sources. The daily Ammonia loads assumed values that ranged from 30 to 5000 kg NH 3. The tolerance capacity of the waters of the Atibaia River, to protect aquatic life against the toxic effects of the Ammonia, has been violated in reaches near its mouth. The impairment of these waters was more intense during the dry season.

40|$|Odour {{emissions}} from {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTPs) {{are considered to be}} the main causes of disturbance noticed by the exposed population and have relevant impacts on both tourism economy and land costs. Odour impact from WWTPs is generated by primary and secondary odour emissions. Primary odour emissions are related especially to the wastewater type and variability discharged into the sewer and directed to the WWTP, and to the wastewater collection and sewage system. Secondary odours are related to the treatment units of the plant. Several studies describe the key role of primary odour emissions and how they are strongly related to odour impacts of WWTPs. In this way, a opportune characterization of the emission capacity of primary odour could be an effective way to control odour emission in the WWTPs. In this study the odour emission capacity (OEC) of different <b>domestic</b> <b>sewers</b> was described and investigated; a correlation between the OEC and the main physical-chemical parameters of wastewater quality was also carried out. Results of this study identify the optimum conditions for sampling and measuring OEC in wastewaters and define its dependence by wastewater quality.

The presence of human serum in tap water slowed the rate of HIV inactivation through 8 h but did not stabilize the virus through 24 h. In addition, blood from stage IV AIDS patients was introduced into tap water, and the recovery of HIV was monitored by using both an infectivity assay and polymerase chain reaction amplification of viral sequences. Virally infected cells were no longer detectable after 5 min in dechlorinated tap water, while little diminution in amplifiable sequences was observed over 2 h.

All samples contained various concentrations of these tracers, indicating a widespread sanitary contamination in urban environments. Fecal coliforms and caffeine levels ranged over several {{orders of magnitude}} with a modest correlation between caffeine and fecal coliforms (R 2 value of 0. 558). An arbitrary threshold of 400 ng caffeine L− 1 allows us to identify samples with an elevated fecal contamination, as defined by more than 200 colony-forming units per 100 mL (cfu 100 mL− 1) of fecal coliforms. Low caffeine levels were sporadically related to high fecal coliform counts. Lower levels of caffeine and fecal coliforms were observed in the brooks while the larger streams and storm water discharge points contained over ten times more. The carbamazepine data showed little or no apparent correlation to caffeine. These data suggest that this storm water collection system, located in a highly urbanized urban environment, is widely contaminated by <b>domestic</b> <b>sewers</b> {{as indicated by the}} ubiquitous presence of fecal contaminants as well as caffeine and carbamazepine.

To analyzed and sewer system design, we can used EPA SWMM 5. 0 with small bore sewer as the main idea for sewer system. Specification that should be fulfilled are minimum pipe slope more than 0. 006, flow rate between 0. 6 - 3 m/s, and water flow quantity in pipe between 0. 2 - 0. 8 of pipe diameter. For treatment plants used septic tank as primary treatment and anaerobic filter as secondary treatment. Total cost for this design are planned Rp 133. 819. 636. 500, 00 with construction duration for one year and ten months...|$|R

Os ensaios eletroquímicos foram realizados sobre eletrodos de platina e carbono vítreo. A técnica de fotoeletrocatálise foi aplicada empregando-se placas de titânio recobertas com nanocamadas de TiO 2. Como fonte de radiação ultravioleta utilizou-se uma lâmpada de vapor de mercúrio de 125 W tanto na fotoeletrocatálise como na fotólise. Através dos estudos da oxidação do estradiol por voltametria cíclica, sobre os eletrodos acima mencionados, foi possível definir o seu potencial de oxidação em soluções de KCl e tampão fosfato (pH 7), sobre platina e carbono vítreo. Estes parâmetros serviram de base para a realização das eletrólises sob condições controladas. A fotoeletrocatálise do estradiol foi realizada sobre Ti/TiO 2 preparado por técnica sol-gel e se mostrou muito mais efetiva que a eletrólise eletrolítica. Finalmente, a fotólise também foi testada empregando-se apenas a lâmpada de vapor de mercúrio. Neste último caso a degradação do estradiol foi ligeiramente inferior que aquela observada por fotoeletrocatálise. Identificou-se que em soluções de KCl há a formação de hipoclorito, o que auxilia o processo oxidativo do estradiol. Espectroscopia de UV-vís e cromatografia líquida (HPLC) foram empregadas para acompanhar os processos de degradação. Apesar de ter sido observado o surgimento de bandas e picos cromatográficos devidos aos produtos formados, não foi possível identifica-los. In {{this project}} {{the use of}} three techniques was investigated: (i) electrolysis, (ii) photoelectrocatalysis and (iii) photolysis, in the degradation of the hormone estradiol, commonly found in the <b>domestic</b> <b>sewers.</b> This hormone can generate serious concerns with a disastrous action that can provoke in the wild and human life. The electrochemistry studies were accomplished on platinum and glassy carbon electrodes. The photoelectrocatalysis technique was applied using titanium plate covered with nanolayers of TiO 2. As a source of ultra-violet radiation was used a lamp bulb of mercury vapor of 125 W for the photoelectrocatalysis as also in the photolysis. Through the studies of the oxidation of the estradiol by cyclic voltammetry, on the electrodes above mentioned, {{it was possible to}} define the oxidation potential of the organic specie in both solutions, KCl and phosphate buffers (pH 7), for platinum and glassy carbon. These parameters served as base for the realization of the electrolysis under controlled conditions. The photoelectrocatalysis of the estradiol was accomplished on Ti/TiO 2 prepared by sol-gel technique and it was shown much more effective than the electrolyitc electrolysis. Finally, the photolysis was also tested being just used the mercury vapor lamp. In this last case the degradation of the estradiol was lightly inferior to that observed by photoelectrocatalysis It was identified that in solutions of KCl there is the hypochlorite formation, what aids the oxidation of the estradiol. Spectroscopy of UV-vis and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to accompany the degradation processes. In spite of the appearance of bands and chromatographyc peaks owed to the formed products having been observed, however, it were not possible identify them...|$|R

The maintenance of the network is inadequate. Therefore, no information is available about the deposits of sewer sediments within the network. A recent pilot investigation is summarised here, which showed that: (1) Deposits do exist in the Athens storm sewer system and may constitute a serious problem for the proper hydraulic function of the network. (2) The sediment discharge capacity of the network during moderate storm events seems to be modest, as deposits of very fine material were traced at certain locations. (3) The finer deposits have high organic loads, which may have been caused by illegal connections of <b>domestic</b> and industrial <b>sewers.</b> These deposits are likely to develop some kind of cohesiveness because dry periods are usually long for the Athens climate...|$|R

40|$|Phosphorus is {{an element}} {{essential}} for life. Concerns regarding long-term security of supply and issues related to eutrophication of surface waters once released into the aquatic environment have led governments to consider and apply measures for reducing the use and discharge of phosphorus. Examples of source control include legislation to reduce phosphorus use in domestic detergents. This research shows that other domestic sources of phosphorus also contribute significantly to the <b>domestic</b> load to <b>sewer</b> and that overall, domestic sources dominate loads to sewage treatment works. Estimates provided here show that although the natural diet contributes 40 % of the domestic phosphorus load, other potentially preventable sources contribute significantly to the estimated 44, 000 tonnes of phosphorus entering UK sewage treatment works each year. In the UK, food additives are estimated to contribute 29 % of the domestic load; automatic dishwashing detergents contribute 9 % and potentially increasing; domestic laundry 14 %, including contributions from phosphonates, but decreasing; phosphorus dosing to reduce lead levels in tap water 6 %; food waste disposed of down the drain 1 %; and personal care products 1 %. Although UK data is presented here, it is anticipated that similar impacts would be expected for other developed economies. Consideration of alternatives to all preventable sources of phosphorus from these sources would therefore offer potentially significant reductions in phosphorus loads to sewage treatment works and hence to the aquatic environment. Combining all source control measures and applying them to their maximum extent could potentially lead to the prevention of over 22, 000 tonnes-P/year entering sewage treatment works...|$|R

Nesse município, as medidas de saneamento básico não se diferenciam dos demais municípios do Brasil, pois as ações antrópicas refletem sobre a qualidade da água de seus mananciais, principalmente, pelo despejo direto de esgotos domésticos e industriais, a ocupação desordenada do solo e a ausência de mata ciliar. Realizaram-se oito amostragens dos rios referidos, no perímetro urbano quanto à presença de coliformes totais e fecais. Verificou-se a presença de coliformes totais em todas as amostras e em sete delas confirmou se a presença de coliformes fecais, sendo que nos pontos de amostragem B e E registraram-se os mais altos níveis desse grupo de bactérias. Tal fato exige a tomada de medidas em conformidade com a legislação ambiental, que preconiza o tratamento de esgotos, a recomposição da mata ciliar e a desocupação das áreas de preservação permanente.

ABSTRACTThe {{objective}} of this study aimed to evaluate {{the quality of the}} waters of the Alegria river and its affluent identified as Bolinha river, through the microbiological analysis parameters in the urban área of the city of Medianeira, Paraná state, Brazil. In this city, the basic sanitation procedures do not differ from other Brazilian municipalities, therefore the anthropic actions reflect mainly the quality of its water sources, through the direct ousting of <b>domestic</b> and industrial <b>sewers,</b> the disordered occupation of the ground and the absence of ciliar bush. Eight samples of these rivers in the urban perimeter had been investigated for the presence of total and feacal coliforms. The presence of total coliformes in all the samples were observed as the confirmation of the presence of feacal coliforms in seven samples. It also was observed that at the B and E sampling points, the highest levels of this group of bacteria were registered. Such occurrence demands measures in conformity with the environmental legislation, that praises the treatment of sewers, resetting of the ciliar bush, and the unoccupation of thepermanent preservation areas.

40|$|Constructed {{wetlands}} {{have become}} a popular treatment alternative, in Europe and USA, mostly for handling municipal wastewaters of small communities. Although treatment of stormwater, combined sewer overflows and wastewaters of different origins such as acid-mine drainage, or agricultural runoff, have also been reported. These treatment systems are complex assemblage of water, substrate, plants, litter (primarily fallen plant material), invertebrates (mostly insects larvae and worms) {{and an array of}} microorganisms (most importantly bacteria). The pollutants in such systems are removed through a combination of physical, chemical and biological processes, including sedimentation, precipitation, adsorption to soil particles, assimilation by plant tissue and microbial transformations. A number of intermittently loaded vertical-flow treatment systems have been constructed in several places of Central-North Europe (especially in Germany and in UK), mainly for the wastewater management of small or remote villages and their performance is considered as very sufficient. However, due to the complexity of these systems relatively little information has been reported so far regarding the effect of specific operational parameters, as well as this respective mechanisms of this treatment method and the localized climatic conditions. For this reason the objective of the present dissertation was: (a) to examine with the performance of laboratory experiments the soil part of the systems, using artificial or real wastewater corresponding to wastestreams of different origins (e. g. dilute untreated domestic sewage, secondary treated <b>domestic</b> sewage, Combined <b>Sewer</b> Overflow and storm water runoff) and (b) {{to examine the effects of}} operating conditions and the particular Greek climatic conditions on the performance of semi-pilot vertical flow constructed wetlands, planted with P. australis and receiving synthetic wastewater simulating medium strength domestic sewage. The laboratory experiments were conducted in Plexiglas columns. The total height of the columns was 2 m, and the internal diameter was 19 cm. The sand layer was 90 cm height, while the gravel layer that was placed on top and bottom of the sand layer, in order to enhance the flow uniformity, was 5 cm height (each). The columns were fed in a batch sequence in order to allow the proper intermittent aeration of the soil bed. Every 72 hours (for a three month period) 8. 5 L of the respective wastewater were applied batch wise to the columns from the top and drained (by gravity) from the bottom (that is that the entire wastewater volume was applied at once). The performance of these sand filters was evaluated in respect to the removal of TSS, COD and nutrients. The observations during the testing period revealed significant reductions of TSS, when existing in the influent; the mean removal efficiency of this parameter was 82 % in the case of dilute wastewater examination. The addition of inoculum in the feed produced better results, in terms of COD removal. The mean COD removal efficiency was 50 % of the uninoculated column, but increased to 70 % for the case of inoculated columns. Significant amounts of PO 4 -P were also removed; the mean removal efficiencies of this parameter were ranging between 85 to 95 %. Only in the case when dilute wastewater was examined, the mean removal efficiency was lower (50 %). ...|$|R
