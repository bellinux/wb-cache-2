5|$|The fairy shrimp {{is found}} in {{temporary}} pools of water, from seasonal ponds to muddy ruts, preferring sites with regular disturbance, such as passing tractors or livestock. It has {{a broad range of}} ecological tolerances, in terms of temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH, but cannot coexist with predatory fish. C. diaphanus swims with its ventral side upwards, and is a <b>filter</b> <b>feeder,</b> collecting zooplankton and detritus with its phyllopodia.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop {{lives on}} the seabed in the sublittoral zone between low tide mark and a depth of , on soft {{sediment}} or on rock, particularly in areas with a strong current. It is a <b>filter</b> <b>feeder,</b> sieving microscopic algae from water that passes through its gills. It is preyed on by starfish, octopuses and sea otters. It can detect predators by smell and by sight and can swim away from them by opening and closing its valves. Other organisms often grow on the exterior of its shell and it often forms a symbiotic relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on the upper valve and helps protect it from predators.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop anchors {{itself to}} the {{substrate}} with a few byssus threads. It is unclear what {{the purpose of these}} is but they may serve to help orient the scallop with regard to the current for optimal feeding. Another possibility is that they may angle the scallop ready for a quick getaway. They are easily broken when the scallop starts to swim. It is a <b>filter</b> <b>feeder.</b> It exposes its mantle by separating its valves and passes water through its gills by ciliary action. A large scallop can process about 4 litres of water an hour per gram of its weight. Phytoplankton are sieved from the water by the gills and moved to the mouth in ciliated grooves. Here they are sorted by a pair of labial palps (mouth appendages), before being ingested. Rejected particles are formed into mucous-wrapped blobs. These are ejected from the mantle cavity at intervals along with the faeces by a rapid clapping of the valves. When the gonads are ripening, a raised level of microalgae in the diet has been found to increase gonadal development. At this time, glycogen storage in the main adductor muscle is depleted as energy is transferred from there to the gonads.|$|E

50|$|<b>Filter</b> <b>feeders</b> are a {{sub-group}} of suspension feeding {{animals that}} feed by straining suspended matter and food particles from water, typically by passing the water over a specialized filtering structure. Some animals that use {{this method of}} feeding are clams, krill, sponges, baleen whales, and many fish (including some sharks). Some birds, such as flamingos and certain species of duck, are also <b>filter</b> <b>feeders.</b> <b>Filter</b> <b>feeders</b> {{can play an important}} role in clarifying water, and are therefore considered ecosystem engineers.|$|R

25|$|Semibalanus balanoides is a <b>filter</b> <b>feeder,</b> {{using its}} {{thoracic}} appendages, or cirri, to capture zooplankton and detritus from the water. If {{there is a}} current, then the barnacle holds its cirri stiffly into the flow, but {{when there is no}} current, the barnacle beats its cirri rhythmically. Plankton levels are highest in Spring and Autumn, and drop significantly during Winter, when the barnacles are dependent on reserves of food which they have stored.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} {{decline in}} Antarctic krill biomass {{may have been}} caused by the reduction of the pack ice zone due to global warming. Antarctic krill, especially {{in the early stages of}} development, seem to need the pack ice structures in order to have a fair chance of survival. The pack ice provides natural cave-like features which the krill uses to evade their predators. In the years of low pack ice conditions the krill tend to give way to salps, a barrel-shaped free-floating <b>filter</b> <b>feeder</b> that also grazes on plankton.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the outlet}} of Lake Belau (Alte Schwentine) abundance, biomass (as dry matter, DM) and {{secondary}} production of benthic macroinvertebrates were investigated at three stream sections with different {{distance to the}} upstream lake. A box sampler with a square area of 500 cm 2 was used. The number of individuals ranged from 8, 067 to 20, 964 ind m− 2. Most individuals belonged to the collectors and <b>filter</b> <b>feeders.</b> At section I near the upstream lake 65. 9 % were collectors and 25. 6 % were <b>filter</b> <b>feeders.</b> At the downstream section III 76. 9 % were collectors and 11. 8 % were <b>filter</b> <b>feeders.</b> The biomass ranged from 140 to 335 g DM m− 2 and was dominated by <b>filter</b> <b>feeders</b> at all stream sections (128. 2 to 326. 2 g m− 2). At section I <b>filter</b> <b>feeders</b> contributed with 97. 4 % and collectors only with 1. 9 % to the total biomass. Secondary production varied from 56. 5 to 215. 1 g DM m− 2 yr− 1 and was dominated by the filter-feeders (35. 0 to 192. 6 g DM m− 2 yr− 1). Production of collectors varied between 11. 8 and 44. 4 g m− 2 yr− 1. The distance from the upstream lake is less important for macroinvertebrate density than {{the different types of}} substrate with their proportional areas at the stream sections. With increasing distance from the lake macroinvertebrate biomass decreases due to high proportions of molluscs. Production of <b>filter</b> <b>feeders</b> decreases with increasing distance from the upstream lake. Production is primarily determined by availability of allochthonous material from the lake and muchless by the structures at the stream banks or the substrate {{at the bottom of the}} stream...|$|R
2500|$|They {{possess the}} typical shark lamniform body plan {{and have been}} mistaken for great white sharks. The two species can be easily {{distinguished}} by the basking shark's cavernous jaw, up to [...] in width, longer and more obvious gill slits that nearly encircle the head and are accompanied by well-developed gill rakers, smaller eyes, much larger overall size and smaller average girth. Great whites possess large, dagger-like teeth; basking shark teeth are much smaller [...] and hooked; only the first three or four rows of the upper jaw and six or seven rows of the lower jaw function. In behaviour, the great white is an active predator of large animals and not a <b>filter</b> <b>feeder.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{basking shark}} is a {{cosmopolitan}} [...] migratory species, {{found in all}} the world's temperate oceans. A slow-moving <b>filter</b> <b>feeder,</b> its common name derives from its habit of feeding at the surface, appearing to be basking in the warmer water there. It has anatomical adaptations for filter feeding, such as a greatly enlarged mouth and highly developed gill rakers. Its snout is conical and the gill slits extend around {{the top and bottom}} of its head. The gill rakers, dark and bristle-like, are used to catch plankton as water filters through the mouth and over the gills. The teeth are very small and numerous, and often number one hundred per row. The teeth have a single conical cusp, are curved backwards, and are the same on both the upper and lower jaws. This species has the smallest weight-for-weight brain size of any shark, reflecting its relatively passive lifestyle.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} much {{discussion}} about the feeding habits of Struthiomimus. Because of its straight-edged beak, Struthiomimus {{may have been an}} omnivore. Some theories suggest that {{it may have been a}} shore-dweller and may have been a <b>filter</b> <b>feeder.</b> Some paleontologists noted that it was more likely to be a carnivore because it is classified within the otherwise carnivorous theropod group. This theory has never been discounted, but Osborn, who described and named the dinosaur, proposed that it probably ate buds and shoots from trees, shrubs and other plants, using its forelimbs to grasp branches and its long neck to enable it accurately to select particular items. This herbivorous diet is further supported by the unusual structure of its hands. The second and third fingers were of equal length, could not function independently, and were probably bound together by skin as a single unit. The structure of the shoulder girdle did not allow a high elevation of the arm nor was optimised for a low reach. The hand could not be fully flexed for a grasping motion or spread for raking. This indicates that the hand was used as a [...] "hook" [...] or [...] "clamp", for bringing branches or fern fronds at shoulder height within reach. However, these adaptations might have been used for wing feather support instead.|$|E
