The culvert fence is made {{small enough to}} encourage the beavers to dam on it, but the resulting pond is prevented from rising to a dangerous level by a Pond Leveler Pipe installed through the culvert fence. The Fence and Pipe flow device needs very little maintenance and limits where and <b>how</b> <b>high</b> <b>the</b> beavers can dam; however, to be most effective, the intake end of the pipe should usually sit in at least 3 feet of water. When this water depth is not possible, a simple Culvert Protective Fence {{may be the best}} option.|$|E
25|$|A Snyder {{column is}} an {{extremely}} effective air-cooled column used in selected fractional distillations. It is a single glass tube {{with a series of}} circular indentations/restrictions in the walls of the cylinder (e.g., 3 or 6) in which rest, inverted, the same number of roughly tear-shaped, hollow, sealed glass stoppers; above each point where an inverted tear-shaped stopper rests, the cylinder has further Vigreux-type indentations, in this case serving to limit <b>how</b> <b>high</b> <b>the</b> glass stopper can be raised (by vapor flow) above its resting place, where, when not raised, it seals the circular opening created by the circular indentation. These floating glass stoppers act as check valves, closing and opening with vapor flow, and enhancing vapor-condensate mixing. A standard application of Snyder columns, is as the condenser/fractionation column above a Kuderna-Danish concentrator, used to efficiently separate a low boiling extraction solvent such as methylene chloride from volatile but higher boiling extract components (e.g., after the extraction of organic contaminants in soil).|$|E
25|$|Compared to filters {{that hang}} {{on the back of}} the aquarium, canister-style {{external}} filters offer a greater quantity of filter materials to be used along with a greater degree of flexibility with respect to filter material choice. Water enters the canister filled with the chosen filter material through an intake pipe at the bottom of the canister, passes through the material, and is fed back to the aquarium through the return pipe. Water is forced to circulate through the filter by a pump typically installed at the top of the canister. It is important to note that canister filters are sealed, fully flooded systems, meaning that the aquarium, intake pipe, filter interior and the return pipe form a continuous body of water. In this configuration both the intake and return path form two siphons, which precisely counterbalance each other. Under these circumstances, the filter pump does not have to spend any effort to lift the water back to the aquarium, regardless of <b>how</b> <b>high</b> <b>the</b> latter is installed above the canister. The pump should only be powerful enough to push the water through the filtering material as well as overcome the drag in the intake and return pipes. This makes canister filter pumps virtually insensitive to the height difference between the aquarium and the filter (although exceeding the manufacturer-specified height limit can lead to leaks).|$|E

500|$|Due {{to their}} lackluster 2013 performance, the Phillies had the seventh first-round {{pick in the}} June 5–7 MLB draft. They {{selected}} Aaron Nola, a starting pitcher from Louisiana State University predicted {{by many to be}} one of the first draft picks to reach the major leagues, for fast-tracking through the Phillies' minor-league system. In the second round, they selected another pitcher – lefthander Matt Imhof, who played college ball with the Cal Poly Mustangs – and selected Aaron Brown, a pitcher-outfielder from Pepperdine, in the third round. The Phillies changed their organizational draft philosophy from drafting unpolished players with potential to selecting players ready to contribute to the big-league club, picking only one high-school player in the first 28 rounds. Michael Baumann wrote on the Crashburn Alley blog, [...] "Given <b>how</b> <b>high</b> <b>the</b> Phillies drafted and how bad their farm system is at the top, I wanted them to get back into the game with one swing. This draft won’t do that, but generally you want to get at least one good major league player out of every draft class, plus some odds and ends." ...|$|E

Her act featured the songs [...] "The Tiddly Wink", [...] "I'd Like to Live in Paris All the Time (The Coster Girl in Paris)", and [...] "The Aviator". The numbers were popular, {{partly due to}} the Americanisation of each song's lyrics. On a personal level, Lloyd's time in America was miserable and was made worse by the increasing domestic abuse she received from Dillon. [...] The assaults caused her to miss several key performances, which angered the theatre manager, Edward Albee, who threatened her with a breach of contract action. [...] She claimed that illness made it difficult for her to perform and protested at her billing position. The theatrical press were not convinced. The New York Telegraph speculated [...] "In vaudeville circles her domestic relations are thought to be at the bottom of her attacks of disposition."

2500|$|Short selling is {{sometimes}} referred to as a [...] "negative income investment strategy" [...] because there is no potential for dividend income or interest income. Stock is held only long enough to be sold pursuant to the contract, and one's return is therefore limited to short term capital gains, which are taxed as ordinary income. For this reason, buying shares (called [...] "going long") has a very different risk profile from selling short. [...] Furthermore, a [...] "long's" [...] losses are limited because the price can only go down to zero, but gains are not, as there is no limit, in theory, on <b>how</b> <b>high</b> <b>the</b> price can go. [...] On the other hand, the short seller's possible gains are limited to the original price of the stock, which can only go down to zero, whereas the loss potential, again in theory, has no limit. [...] For this reason, short selling probably is most often used as a hedge strategy to manage the risks of long investments.|$|E
2500|$|Chair Entertainment's {{creative}} director Donald Mustard stated {{that much of}} Shadow Complex is based around the gameplay of Super Metroid, a game he considers [...] "the pinnacle of 2D game design". Much of their effort was in creating the Metroid-style of gameplay, a first for their company. The first month of development was spent having the team replaying the various Metroid games {{in order to establish}} the language and concepts of such games for development in order to expand on enjoyable sections while avoiding the mistakes of these games. Chair's design process started by drawing out the game's world on graph paper, using the concepts of tile-based games to craft out the world, despite the final game not being tile-based. This process set certain rules, such as <b>how</b> <b>high</b> <b>the</b> character may jump with the various upgrades or how far the character must run before a certain power would activate. They then played out the game on this paper map {{to make sure that all}} parts of the game were possible to complete. Such a map was also used to help with the game's pacing, making sure that the player's interest in the game would remain despite the acquisition of more and more powerups.|$|E
2500|$|The Van de Graaff {{generator}} {{was invented}} by American physicist Robert J. Van de Graaff in 1929 at MIT as a particle accelerator. The first model was demonstrated in October 1929. [...] In the Van de Graaff machine, an insulating belt transports electric charge to the interior of an insulated hollow metal high voltage terminal, where it is transferred to the terminal by a [...] "comb" [...] of metal points. [...] The advantage of the design was that {{since there was no}} electric field in the interior of the terminal, the charge on the belt could continue to be discharged onto the terminal regardless of <b>how</b> <b>high</b> <b>the</b> voltage on the terminal was. [...] Thus the only limit to the voltage on the machine is ionization of the air next to the terminal. [...] This occurs when the electric field at the terminal exceeds the dielectric strength of air, about 30kV per centimeter. Since the highest electric field is produced at sharp points and edges, the terminal is made {{in the form of a}} smooth hollow sphere; the larger the diameter the higher the voltage attained. [...] The first machine used a silk ribbon bought at a five and dime store as the charge transport belt. In 1931 a version able to produce 1,000,000 volts was described in a patent disclosure.|$|E
