The {{effect of}} various fuel <b>injection</b> <b>advance</b> angles on the {{emissions}} of an electronically controlled, high pressure, common rail, turbocharged GW 4 D 20 diesel engine fuelled with different pistacia chinensis bunge seed biodiesel/diesel blends has been experimentally investigated. The {{results indicate that}} brake specific fuel consumption reduces with the increasing of fuel <b>injection</b> <b>advance</b> angle, and the BSFC of blends is higher than diesel. At 25 % load, CO and THC are significantly reduced compared with higher load. The CO emission increases with the increment of fuel <b>injection</b> <b>advance</b> angle. At 75 % load, the CO of B 10 is lowest, B 20 highest. At the same speed, NOx increases with increment of fuel <b>injection</b> <b>advance</b> angle for diesel and biodiesel blends dramatically. However, NOx of blends and diesel are deteriorated at high load, {{but there are no}} obvious differences among them...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the combustion of gasoline, safety, and diesel fuels {{was made in the}} NACA combustion apparatus under conditions of temperature that permitted ignition by spark with direct fuel injection, in spite of the compression ratio of 12. 7 employed. The influence of such variables as <b>injection</b> <b>advance</b> angle, jacket temperature, engine speed, and spark position was studied. The most pronounced effect was that an increase in the <b>injection</b> <b>advance</b> angle (beyond a certain minimum value) caused a decrease in the extent and rate of combustion. In almost all cases combustion improved with increased temperature. The results show that at low air temperatures the rates of combustion vary with the volatility of the fuel, but that at high temperatures this relationship does not exist and the rates depend to a greater extent on the chemical nature of the fuel...|$|R

Three cam-operated fuel-injection pumps, two pumps cams, and an automatic injection valve with two different nozzles were used. Ignition lag was considered to be the interval between the start of injection of the fuel as determined with a Stroborama and the start of effective combustion as determined from the indicator diagram, the latter being the point where 4. 0 x 10 (exp- 6) pound of fuel had been effectively burned. For this particular engine and fuel it was found that: (1) for a constant start and the same rate of fuel injection up the point of cut-off, a variation in fuel quantity from 1. 2 x 10 (exp- 4) to 4. 1 x 10 (exp- 4) pound per cycle has no appreciable effect on the ignition lag; (2) <b>injection</b> <b>advance</b> angle increases or decreases the lag according to whether density, temperature, or turbulence has the controlling influence; (3) increase in valve-opening pressure slightly increases the lag; and (4) increase of inlet-air pressure, compression ratio, and engine speed reduces the lag...|$|R

40|$|Societal {{concerns}} on combustion-based {{fuel consumption}} are ever-increasing. With respect to internal combustion engines, this translates to {{a need to}} increase brake fuel conversion efficiency (BFCE). Diesel engines are a relatively efficient internal combustion engine to consider for numerous applications, but associated actions to mitigate certain exhaust emissions have generally deteriorated engine efficiency. Conventionally, diesel engine emission control has centered on in-cylinder techniques. Although these continue to hold promise, the industry trend is presently favoring the use of after-treatment devices which create new opportunities to improve the diesel engine's brake fuel conversion efficiency. This study focuses on injection timing effects on the combustion processes, engine efficiency, and the engine system's responses. The engine in the study is a medium duty diesel engine (capable of meeting US EPA Tier III off road emission standards) equipped with common rail direct fuel injection, variable geometry turbo charging, and interfaced with a custom built engine controller. The study found that injection timing greatly affected BFCE by changing the combustion phasing. BFCE would increase up to a maximum then begin to decrease as phasing became less favorable. Combustion phasing would change from being mostly mixing controlled combustion to premixed combustion as <b>injection</b> timing would <b>advance</b> allowing more time for fuel to mix during the ignition delay. Combustion phasing, in turn, would influence many other engine parameters. As <b>injection</b> timing is <b>advanced,</b> in-cylinder temperatures and pressures amplify, and intake and exhaust manifold pressures deteriorate. Rate of heat release and rate of heat transfer increase when <b>injection</b> timing is <b>advanced.</b> Turbocharger speed falls with the <b>advancing</b> <b>injection</b> timing. Torque, however, rose to a maximum then fell off again even though engine speed and fueling rate were held constant between different injection timings. Interestingly, the coefficient of heat transfer changes from a two peak curve to a smooth one peak curve as the <b>injection</b> timing is <b>advanced</b> further. The major conclusion {{of the study is}} that <b>injection</b> <b>advance</b> both positively and negatively influences the diesel engine's response which contributes to the brake fuel conversion efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Pinch {{analysis}} {{is based on}} the hot, cold and grand composite curves and is the most commonly-used approach to identify strategies for reducing energy consumption by heat exchanger network retrofit. This method was originally developed for the synthesis of new networks, and there remain certain difficulties for its application to improve existing networks. The <b>advanced</b> composite <b>curves</b> have been developed for retrofit situations specifically, and use data about existing heat exchangers to provide more information about the modifications necessary to achieve heat savings. Bridge analysis, which {{is based on the}} energy transfer diagram, is a new method and enumerates the sets of heat transfer modifications necessary to save energy. In this paper, the grand composite <b>curve,</b> the <b>advanced</b> composite <b>curves</b> and the energy transfer diagram have been constructed for analysis of the heat exchanger network of a kraft pulp mill. Links between these methods are made explicit; then results are discussed and compared. It is shown that the information provided by these approaches is consistent; however, the level of detail progressively increases from the grand composite <b>curve</b> to the <b>advanced</b> composite <b>curves</b> until the energy transfer diagram. Fundamentally, reducing the energy consumption implies decreasing the flow rate of heat cascaded through the network from the hot utility until the environment. As a consequence, any heat savings solution includes network modifications bridging coolers to heaters. Traditional pinch analysis does not provide information about the network modifications required after removal of cross-pinch transfers, while the <b>advanced</b> composite <b>curves</b> indicate the heat savings potential attainable through modifications of few existing heat exchanger units. Bridge analysis provides more detail about heat savings modifications, which bridge existing heaters and coolers, than traditional pinch analysis and the <b>advanced</b> composite <b>curves</b> do...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Concern {{over the}} {{environment}} and=or {{the increasing demand}} for conventional fossil fuel has promoted interest {{in the development of}} alternative sources of fuel energy for internal combustion (IC) engines. The effect of <b>advanced</b> <b>injection</b> timing on the performance of natural gas used as primary fuel in dual-fuel combustion has been examined. Satisfactory diesel engine combustion demands self-ignition of the fuel as it is injected near the top dead centre (TDC) into the hot swirling compressed cylinder gas. Longer delays between injection and ignition lead to unacceptable rates of pressure rise (diesel knock) because too much fuel is ready to burn when combustion eventually occurs. Natural gas has been noted to exhibit longer ignition delays and slower burning rates especially at low load levels hence resulting in late combustion in the expansion stroke. <b>Advanced</b> <b>injection</b> timing is expected to compensate for these effects. The engine has standard injection timing of 30 before TDC (BTDC). The <b>injection</b> was first <b>advanced</b> by 5 : 5 given injection timing of 35 : 5 BTDC.
