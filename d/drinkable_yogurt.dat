25|$|Camel milk is {{a staple}} food of desert nomad tribes and is {{sometimes}} considered a meal {{in and of}} itself; a nomad can live on only camel milk for almost a month. Camel milk is rich in vitamins, minerals, proteins, and immunoglobulins; compared to cow's milk, it is lower in fat and lactose, and higher in potassium, iron, and vitamin C. Bedouins believe the curative powers of camel milk are enhanced if the camel's diet consists of certain desert plants. Camel milk can readily {{be made into a}} <b>drinkable</b> <b>yogurt,</b> as well as butter or cheese, though the yields for cheese tend to be low.|$|E

Using a discrete choice (nested-logit) model and scanner data of yogurt purchases in the Italian market, this paper analyzes the demand for both conventional and functional yogurts assessing also the role of health-related demographics as shifters. The empirical results show that, in the category analyzed, while higher prices are still a deterrent for the success of some functional products, <b>drinkable</b> functional <b>yogurts</b> appear successfully differentiated, benefitting from a relatively low own-price elasticity of demand. The results suggest also that health-related consumers’ characteristics {{play an important role in}} shifting the demand for yogurts (both conventional and functional), indicating that, consistently with previous findings, consumers aiming to improve (or maintain) their health status are more inclined to buy functional products than conventional ones.

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes {{leads to}} severe health {{problems}} and is the third {{leading cause of death}} among the major 5 pathogens. A synthesized novel sugar ester, lactose monolaurate (LML), has antimicrobial properties against Listeria monocytogenes. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of LML is less than 5 mg/mL (9. 5 mM) in growth media. To determine which moiety of LML dominates in its bacteriostatic activities, the antibacterial effect of lactose, lauric acid and Tween 20 were tested. Lactose has no inhibition effect on Listeria. Lauric acid and Tween 20 had some antimicrobial effect (3. 48 and 1. 59 log reduction respectively), but did not have a bactericidal effect as LML did. To determine the antibacterial effect of LML on L. monocytogenes a 5 -strain cocktail of L. monocytogenes with an initial concentration of approximately 5 log CFU/mL was incubated in milk, yogurt and cottage cheese. The effects were determined via plate counts after 24 -hour incubation at 37 °C. LML had at least a 4 log reduction and killed all the bacteria at 5 mg/mL in fat-free milk, fat-free <b>drinkable</b> <b>yogurt,</b> 1 % fat <b>drinkable</b> <b>yogurt,</b> and fat-free cottage cheese. LML also showed bacteriostatic effect in low-fat milk, whole milk, 1. 5 % fat <b>drinkable</b> <b>yogurt,</b> and 2 % fat cottage cheese with a log reduction varying from 3. 54 to 4. 35. These tests showed that the antibacterial effect of LML was related to the fat content of the dairy products as well as temperature. LML only inhibited Listeria at room temperature (37 °C) and showed no inhibitive effects at refrigeration temperature (4 °C). LML can inhibit the viable but nonculturable state of Listeria monocytogenes for up to 6 weeks at room temperature...|$|E

40|$|Whey is a {{byproduct}} of cheese making; whey proteins are globular proteins which can be modified and polymerized to add functional benefits, these benefits can be both nutritional and structural in foods. Modified proteins {{can be used in}} non-foods, being of particular interest in polymer films and coatings. Food packaging materials, including plastics, can linings, interior coatings of paper containers, and beverage cap sealing materials, are generally made of synthetic petroleum based compounds. These synthetic materials may pose a potential human health risk due to presence of certain chemicals such as Bisphenol A (BPA). They also add to environmental pollution, being difficult to degrade. Protein-based materials {{do not have the same}} issues as synthetics and so can be used as alternatives in many packaging types. As proteins are generally hydrophilic they must be modified structurally and their performance enhanced by the addition of waterproofing agents. Polymerization of whey proteins results in a network, adding both strength and flexibility. The most interesting of the food-safe waterproofing agents are the (large aspect ratio) nanoclays. Nanoclays are relatively inexpensive, widely available and have low environmental impact. The clay surface can be modified to make it organophilic and so compatible with organic polymers. The objective of this study is the use of polymerized whey protein (PWP), with reinforcing nanoclays, to produce flexible surface coatings which limit the transfer of contents while maintaining food safety. Four smectite and kaolin type clays, one treated and three natural were assessed for strengthening qualities and the potential waterproofing and plasticizing benefits of other additives were also analyzed. The nutritional benefits of whey proteins can also be used to enhance the protein content of various foodstuffs. <b>Drinkable</b> <b>yogurt</b> is a popular beverage in the US and other countries and is considered a functional food, especially when produced with probiotic bacteria. Carbonation was applied to a <b>drinkable</b> <b>yogurt</b> to enhance its benefits. This process helps reduce the oxygen levels in the foodstuff thus potentially being advantageous to the microaerophilic probiotic bacteria while simultaneously producing a product, somewhat similar to kefir, which has the potential to fill a niche in the functional foods market. Yogurt was combined with a syrup to reduce its viscosity, making it drinkable, and also to allow infusion of CO 2. This dilution reduced the protein content of the drink and so whey protein concentrate was added to increase levels in the final product. High-methoxyl pectins were used to provide stability by reducing the tendency of the proteins to sediment out. The objectives of this study were to develop a manufacturing technology for drinkable carbonated symbiotic yogurts, and to evaluate their physicochemical properties. Two flavors of yogurt drink, pomegranate and vanilla, were formulated containing inulin as prebiotic, along with probiotic bacteria, producing symbiotic dairy beverages...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study and develop new {{varieties}} of drinking yogurt based on the technology of fermented milk drinks with added wild plant ingredients. In this case the wild plant ‘actinidia kolomikta’ (A. kolomikta) which grows in the southern Far East of Russia was used. Research on the product range and consumer preferences in retail networks was conducted in the cities of Khabarovsk and Vladivostok allowing to justify {{the introduction of the}} new yogurts. The study shows that among the available yogurts only one fifth is produced in the far East {{and more than half of}} the yogurts are produced in the Central part of Russia. Although, yogurt from local raw materials was found in isolated cases, there was no yogurt preparation that uses wild plants. A vast majority of the respondents were interested in and were willing to buy enriched yogurt with functional food ingredients such as those present in fermented milk products prepared with traditional technologies which are used for the preparation of the yogurt of our study. The paper also presents the formulation and technological scheme of the new drink, their physicochemical and organoleptic characteris-tics, and safety performance. The new <b>drinkable</b> <b>yogurt</b> that contains the ‘actinidia kolomik-ta’ fruit complies with the properties of functional food. This type of yogurts are eligible as functional food because they meet the requirements of the operating normative documenta-tion (GOST R 52409 - 2005) and are probiotic. The functional ingredients providing these properties to the yogurt are the vitamin and mineral components. The study concludes that is viable to obtain high-quality drinking yogurt with functional purposes using the Far Eastern herbal raw ingredient ‘actinidia kolomikta’...|$|E
40|$|Background: Lactobacillus gasseri strain SBT 2055 (LG 2055) {{is a human}} intestine-originating {{probiotic}} bacterium and potent probiotic {{known to}} exert various health promotion effects, including prevention of abdominal adiposity in rats and humans. A recent finding in mice has suggested that oral administration of LG 2055 induces a protective effect against influenza A virus infection. In this context, evidence for the efficacy of LG 2055 using a human clinical trial was imminently required. Methods: To confirm this in humans, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel- group study in healthy adult volunteers was conducted to {{examine the effect of}} <b>drinkable</b> <b>yogurt</b> (DY) containing LG 2055 on influenza, with vaccine-specific antibody responses as the primary objective and innate immune responses as the secondary objective. Subjects were asked to consume 100 g/day of DY with LG 2055 (LG 2055 group; n = 94) or without LG 2055 (placebo group; n = 94) for 16 weeks. After 4 weeks, all subjects received a trivalent influenza vaccine. Results: We found that the intake of LG 2055 DY increased hemagglutination inhibition titers against influenza viruses A/H 1 N 1 and B and the rate of seroprotection against influenza B after vaccination as compared with the intake of placebo DY by healthy volunteers. In support of this result, we confirmed that total IgG and IgA levels in plasma and sIgA production in saliva were also higher in the LG 2055 group than in the placebo group. Furthermore, the intake of LG 2055 DY enhanced natural killer cell activity and myxovirus resistance A gene expression, {{which is one of the}} antiviral genes stimulated by type I or type III Interferons in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Conclusions: These results strongly indicate that LG 2055 activates both the innate and adaptive human immune responses, suggesting the potential to prevent influenza virus infections by providing specific probiotics as complementary foods...|$|E
