5|$|Females can lay five {{clutches}} per year, but two is {{a normal}} average after including the 30–50% of a population's females that do not produce any clutches in a <b>given</b> <b>year.</b> In some northern populations, no females lay more than one clutch per year. Bigger females tend to lay bigger eggs and more eggs per clutch. Clutch sizes of the subspecies vary, although the differences may reflect different environments, rather than different genetics. The two more northerly subspecies, western and midland, are larger and have more eggs per clutch—11.9 and 7.6, respectively—than the two more southerly subspecies, southern (4.2) and eastern (4.9). Within subspecies, also, the more northerly females lay larger clutches.|$|E

The nominations for a <b>given</b> <b>year</b> are accepted till 30 April or last working day of April with not more than two sportspersons nominated for each sports discipline. A twelve-member committee evaluates the performances of a sportsperson at various International events like Olympic Games, Paralympic Games, Asian Games, and Commonwealth Games.

The building is a triangular shape, allowing for the segregation of students from the three schools; each section is about the same size. It was built about 100years before the story begins, around the same time that Miator was established, for students whose homes are far away. Each student is assigned a roommate in their year until graduation.

5|$|The Moon's orbit intersects {{with the}} {{ecliptic}} {{at the two}} nodes that are 180 degrees apart. Therefore, the new moon occurs close to the nodes at two periods of the year approximately six months (173.3 days) apart, known as eclipse seasons, and {{there will always be}} at least one solar eclipse during these periods. Sometimes the new moon occurs close enough to a node during two consecutive months to eclipse the Sun on both occasions in two partial eclipses. This means that, in any <b>given</b> <b>year,</b> there will always be at least two solar eclipses, and there can be as many as five.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Blanca was the {{earliest}} recorded tropical cyclone {{to make landfall}} in Baja California in any <b>given</b> <b>year.</b> Forming as a tropical depression on May31, Blanca initially struggled to organize due to strong wind shear. However, once this abated, the system took advantage of high sea surface temperatures and ample moisture. After becoming a tropical storm on June1, Blanca rapidly intensified on June2–3, becoming a powerful Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale; maximum sustained winds reached 145mph (230km/h) at this time. The hurricane's slow motion resulted in tremendous upwelling of cooler water, resulting {{in a period of}} weakening. Blanca gradually recovered from this and briefly regained Category4 status on June6 as it moved generally northwest toward the Baja California peninsula. Cooler waters and increased shear again prompted weakening on June7 and the system struck Baja California Sur on June8 as a weak tropical storm. It quickly degraded to a depression and dissipated early the next day.|$|E
5|$|In North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, {{rainfall}} {{was generally}} light, {{with the exception}} of a few areas receiving over 3inches (75mm). Henri produced greater amounts of rain in Delaware and Pennsylvania, with a peak of 9.02in (229mm) in Hockessin. In Downingtown, Pennsylvania, over eightinches (203mm) of rain fell in around sixhours, while Doppler Radar estimated that Kennett Square received over 10inches (255mm) in a five-hour period. The heavy rainfall led to record discharge rates along the Red Clay Creek, which also had a record crest peaking at just below 26feet (8m). Parts of the creek saw a 500-year flood, which has a 0.2% chance of occurring in any <b>given</b> <b>year.</b> Numerous rivers in southeastern Pennsylvania also crested above their flood stage.|$|E

5|$|The Winter Olympics {{was created}} to feature snow and ice sports that were logistically {{impossible}} to hold during the Summer Games. Figure skating (in 1908 and 1920) and ice hockey (in 1920) were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics. The IOC desired to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities. At the 1921 Olympic Congress in Lausanne, {{it was decided to}} hold a winter version of the Olympic Games. A winter sports week (it was actually 11days) was held in 1924 in Chamonix, France, in connection with the Paris Games held three months later; this event became the first Winter Olympic Games. Although it was intended that the same country host both the Winter and Summer Games in a <b>given</b> <b>year,</b> this idea was quickly abandoned. The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart. This tradition was upheld until the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, the Winter Olympics were held every four years, two years after each Summer Olympics.|$|E
