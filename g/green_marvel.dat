40|$|Background: Broccoli, Brassica oleracea subsp. italica {{is one of}} {{the many}} {{valuable}} Brassica species which is still less cultured under in vitro condition. Heat tolerant transgenic and non-transgenic broccoli cv. <b>Green</b> <b>Marvel</b> plantlets with well-developed root system obtained through in vitro culture were transferred into disposable plastic pots containing sterilized potting mixture consisting of (peatgroTM) + coconut dust (2 : 1) and maintained in a growth chamber. Results: After one month, the hardened plantlets were transferred and maintained in a transgenic greenhouse. After four months of acclimatization in the transgenic greenhouse, the efficacy of HSP 101 gene in increasing the heat tolerance of the transgenic broccoli was evaluated. Results showed that the transgenic plants could survive and performed normally, producing flower heads even at the highest tested temperature of 34 ºC. Seven transgenic broccoli lines with different gene copy number of the AtHSP 101 gene as well as the control plant were assessed for genetic diversity using inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Conclusions: ISSR results showed polymorphism and phylogenetic relationship between the transgenic and non-transgenic (control) Brassica oleracea cv. <b>Green</b> <b>Marvel...</b>|$|E

50|$|The Sunstone {{crystals}} then form {{tanks and}} hover-craft. Captain <b>Marvel,</b> <b>Green</b> Lantern, the Justice Society of America and the Teen Titans arrive to intervene but are prevented {{from entering the}} city by an energy shield generated by Luthor's stolen ship, which he declares to be the Kryptonian flagship once commanded by General Dru-Zod. Superman goes on to damage {{the section of the}} warship that controls the remote craft with his heat, causing Luthor to release kryptonite into the ship's matrix and also to change the warship into a robot. Having enough, Superman takes all of his energy and flies at speed through the cockpit of the warship, destroying it and removing Luthor from the controls. Weakened by the kryptonite, Superman's momentum carries both himself and Luthor through the ship and high above the West River as his powers fade, causing the two to crash into the water below.|$|R
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety said, [...] "what seemed, in theory, the least-necessary {{revival of}} a big screen superhero emerges as {{perfectly}} solid summer action fare in The Incredible Hulk." [...] He emphasized [...] "it's all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, staged efficiently and {{with a hint of}} enthusiasm," [...] and [...] "penned with sporadic wit [...] Visuals lean toward the dark and murky, but editing by three—actually six—hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong's ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pic's generally pro but not inspired achievements." [...] Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald applauded that the film [...] "does a lot of things [...] Lee's Hulk didn't: It's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity". Mark Rahner of The Seattle Times wrote that, [...] "The relaunch of <b>Marvel's</b> <b>green</b> goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 Hulk in nearly every way – except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said, [...] "What lingers in my memory ... is the lengthy, essentially animated climactic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem, and an earlier showdown between the title creature and the U.S. Army, which is deploying high-tech weapons including sound-wave cannons. These are expertly staged by director Louis Leterrier, who disposes of the backstory under the opening credits and wraps up the whole thing in twenty-four minutes less than [...] Lee took". Roger Ebert was not a fan of the film stating, [...] "The Incredible Hulk is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's Hulk too talky, or dare I say, too thoughtful. But not for me. It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action sequences." ...|$|R
