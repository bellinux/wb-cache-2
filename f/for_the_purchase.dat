40|$|The {{multiple}} objective {{problem of}} purchasing for business falls into two broad categories: <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> of components <b>for</b> manufacturing and <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> of services.

To our knowledge, no supplier selection model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> of services has been published. In this paper we elaborate on a mathematical programming model that selects suppliers of a multiple item service and simultaneously determines market shares of the suppliers selected. The methodology {{is based on the}} collection of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) information, quantifying all the costs associated with <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process throughout <b>the</b> entire value chain of the firm.

A large stone pillar was constructed inside the tower, raising the telescope to bring it closer to the dome and improve its field of view.
