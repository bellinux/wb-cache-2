40|$|Background: In {{recent years}} Khartoum State {{population}} increased dramatically so consumption of fruit juices increased. Quality control {{and safety of}} fruit juices in Khartoum State should be evaluated. Design: Cross sectional study to study quality control and safety of fruit juices in Khartoum State. Setting: Five plants for fruit juices manufacturing in Khartoum State were included in this study. Objectives: The main objective was to study the quality control and safety of fruit juice in manufacturing plants in Khartoum State. Specific Objectives were to identify the microbiological contamination sources in juice manufacturing, to determine the microbial quality of finished product and to evaluate monitoring systems in fruit juices manufacturing plants. Methods: Microbiological analysis for seventy five samples collected from water, syrup and finished products were done to evaluate juice quality during production stages. Observation notes were taken to evaluate: buildings, workers and hygiene situation. Questionnaires were distributed among quality control and production managers in plants under study to evaluate fruit juices manufacturing process. Results: Findings indicate defective quality of fruit juices {{as a result of}} crosscontamination during preparation of juices. Laboratory analysis showed that the microbial quality of finished products was at unacceptable limit (≥ 102 CFU/ml). Pathogenic bacteria such as Klebsiella, S. Aureus, Shigella, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter and Bacillus cereus were isolated in syrup rooms and finished product stages. Water was the source of contamination by Klebsiella in plant (A) and by Enterobacter in plant (D). Questionnaires results showed that juices were not <b>handled</b> <b>hygienically</b> and not stored at right temperature. Monitoring systems established were not effective. Finished products shelf lifes were extended beyond the shelf life of raw materials. Observation notes showed that cleaning schedules were neglected and cleaning labours were involved in syrup preparation which considered as risk for cross-contamination in some plants. Poor personal hygiene and wrong handling were the main sources for cross-contamination in syrup and finished products stages. No raw materials analyses were carried to ensure safety of juices in all tested plants. X All plants were using automatic filling system to reduce cross contamination during filling process, but cross contamination occurred in some plants due to neglect sanitation. Conclusion: Some of fruit juices produced in Khartoum State were not prepared according to food safety procedures. Food control systems such as Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP), Good Hygiene Practice (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) should be applied to produce safe products...|$|E
40|$|In {{the high}} ambient {{temperatures}} of the tropics, freshly caught fish and freshly slaughtered meat, however <b>hygienically</b> <b>handled</b> and stored, will not keep {{for very long}} without some form of preservation. Preservation is also the means of dealing with seasonal surpluses to provide supplies during times of shortage. A number of simple preservation techniques suitable for small-scale preservation, such as at the household or village level, are describe in this booklet. The emphasis is on 'small-scale', to inform individuals how to process and store their surplus economically. In {{order to be able}} to preserve foods correctly knowledge of the causes of spoilage is needed and so the booklet begins with a discussion of spoilage and its prevention. The principles and methods of preservation are explained and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are described. Each method is well illustrated with good diagrams which clearly show the technique used.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} is to confirm the isolation of Salmonella typhimurium and determine the penetration ability of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis isolated from raw bovine meat in Kota Bharu. The identification of Salmonella typhimurium was done using PCR technique. The penetration experiment was conducted on meat without fat and meat with fat under at temperature and 4 - 8 °C. After several hours, different layer the meats were sliced, homogenized with 10 ml of peptone water, and a loop full of the homogenates was streaked on agar plates to determine the penetration ability of the bacteria. Salmonella typhimurium and Proteus mirabilis was able to penetrate deep into the meat without fat at room temperature. Staphylococcus aureus was able to penetrate in the first hour only. In lower temperature, all bacteria were unable to penetrate except for Proteus mirabilis. The penetration of bacteria was concern regarding to the storage of the meat. Raw meat should be <b>hygienically</b> <b>handle</b> and properly stored to ensure the freshness and public health safety...|$|R
40|$|Various {{traditional}} methods are employed {{to preserve and}} process Rastrineobola argentea locally known as dagaa (sardines) an indigenous fish species of Lake Victoria. The widely used known customarily dagaa and dagaa products preservation methods include sundrying, smoking, salting and various combinations of these. The advantages of smoking dagaa are manifold. Fish smoking prolong shelf life, enhances flavour and increases acceptability and utilization of dagaa. Customarily traditional dagaa processing techniques used by fishers for example sun drying dagaa direct on the unhygienic sand, rocks and or grasses significantly contribute to poor dagaa products. Awareness of the shortcomings of traditional ovens had stimulated development work on new and improved smoking ovens such as Chorkor oven and Nyegezi models ovens for various reasons. In the light of {{lessons learned from the}} constraints and disadvantages associated with earlier smoking techniques, an improved dagaa smoking oven, the modified Altona for hot smoking was introduced. Hot smoking means curing fish by smoking at a temperature of 70 - 80 °C at some stage in the process in order to cook the flesh; hot smoked fish products do not require further cooking before consumption. Unlike other fishes, dagaa are readily available at cheaper price. However, smoked dagaa products have not been promoted in the country wide as well for the region and overseas markets. This may be contributed by the main middlemen traders for sun dried dagaa products who are not willing to opt to trade on smoked dagaa products at domestic markets. Because of the high quality of smoked dagaa compile the hygienic environment for storage and selling. This further enables hygienic handling during trading. If smoked dagaa and dagaa products are properly and <b>hygienically</b> <b>handled</b> extends shelf life. The quality of smoked fish is primarily linked to processing and post processing procedures...|$|R
