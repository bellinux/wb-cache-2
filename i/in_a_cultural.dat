5|$|The social {{repression}} of the 1950s resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> revolution in Greenwich Village. A cohort of poets, later named the Beat poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness. Of them, Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs—both Greenwich Village residents—also wrote bluntly and honestly about homosexuality. Their writings attracted sympathetic liberal-minded people, as well as homosexuals looking for a community.|$|E
5|$|By {{succeeding}} her husband, Ranavalona {{became the}} first female sovereign of the Kingdom of Imerina {{since its founding in}} 1540. Her rise to power occurred <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> milieu that favored men over women in the political sphere. In the traditional culture of Imerina, rulers were specially endowed with the power to innovate in circumvention of established norms and customs. Sovereigns often mobilized innovation through the creation of new forms of kinship, the traditional basis of the political order. Women, however, were associated with the household, a rigid kinship unit in opposition to the innovating role and power of the sovereign, and so were not viewed as suited to rule. Although female rulers had once been common among the Vazimba, described in oral histories as the original inhabitants of Madagascar, this tradition ended in the central highlands with the reign of Andriamanelo (1540–1575), founder of the Kingdom of Imerina and successor to his Vazimba mother, Queen Rafohy (1530–1540).|$|E

25|$|Finally, the {{developing}} theory of post-structuralism studies art's significance <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> context, {{such as the}} ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work. The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography. Art criticism continues to grow and develop alongside art.|$|E
25|$|The {{heart of}} Central Asian history {{goes back to}} the {{earliest}} Bronze Age colonists of the Tarim Basin were people of Caucasoid physical type who entered probably from the north and west, who may have spoken languages ancestral to the Indo-European Tocharian languages documented later in the Tarim Basin. These early settlers occupied the northern and eastern parts of the Tarim Basin, where their graves have yielded mummies dated about 1800 BC. They participated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> world centered on the eastern steppes of central Eurasia, including modern northeastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.|$|E
25|$|Sicily {{served a}} level of high {{importance}} for the Romans, as it acted as the empire's granary.

25|$|Today, French Canadians live across North America.

Between 1840 and 1930, roughly 900,000 French Canadians emigrated to the United States, mostly to the New England region. Acadians (Acadiens), who reside in the Maritimes, may be included among the French Canadian group in linguistic contexts, but are considered a separate group from the French Canadians <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> sense due to their distinct history, much of which predates the admission of the Maritime Provinces to Canadian Confederation in 1867.|$|E

500|$|Musicians {{from other}} {{countries}} also participated in the resistance to apartheid, both by releasing music critical of the South African government, and by participating <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> boycott of South Africa from 1980 onward. Examples included [...] "Biko" [...] by Peter Gabriel, [...] "Sun City" [...] by Artists United Against Apartheid and a concert in honour of Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday.

500|$|From the {{experience}} of growing up within two cultures Cisneros was able to combine both ethnicities, and in her stories she develops a major theme of hybridity between the American and Mexican cultures. [...] She draws upon her life experience as she [...] "depicts {{the situation of the}} Mexican-American woman: typically caught between two cultures, she resides <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> borderland. The topics of the stories range from the confusions of a bicultural and bilingual childhood to the struggles of a dark-skinned woman to recognize her own beauty in the land of Barbie dolls and blond beauty queens." [...] Because these issues are complex, Cisneros does not try to resolve all of them. Instead, she attempts to find neutral ground where the characters can try to meld their Mexican heritage with an American lifestyle, without feeling homesick for a country which, in some cases, the women have not even experienced.|$|E

[...] Simon Heffer, a fan of Thunderbirds in childhood, commented positively on the series for The Daily Telegraph in 2011: [...] "All the elements we children discerned in whatever grown-up television we had been allowed to watch were present in Thunderbirds: dramatic theme and incidental music; well-developed plots; goodies and baddies; swaggering Americans, {{at a time when the}} whole of Britain was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> cringe to them; and, of course, glamorous locations... Then, of course, there was the nail-biting tension of the rescues themselves..." [...] Film critic Kim Newman describes the series as a [...] "television perennial".|$|E

500|$|Holland-Dozier-Holland left Motown {{in early}} 1968 after {{a dispute with}} the label over {{royalties}} and profit sharing. The quality of Motown's output (and Diana Ross & the Supremes' records in particular) began to falter as a result. From [...] "Reflections" [...] in 1967 to [...] "The Weight" [...] in 1969, only six out of the eleven released singles reached the Top 20, and only one of those, 1968's [...] "Love Child", made it to number one. Due to the tension within the group and stringent touring schedules, neither Mary Wilson nor Cindy Birdsong appear on many of these singles; they were replaced on these recordings by session singers such as the Andantes. The changes within the group and their decreasing sales were signs of changes within the music industry. The gospel-based soul of female performers such as Aretha Franklin had eclipsed the Supremes' pop-based sound, which had by now evolved to include more middle-of-the-road material. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> climate now influenced more than ever by countercultural movements such as the Black Panther Party, the Supremes found themselves attacked for not being [...] "black enough", and lost ground in the black music market.|$|E
500|$|Crowley {{believed}} in the objective existence of magic, which he chose to spell [...] "Magick", an older archaic spelling of the word. He provided various different definitions of this term over his career. In his book Magick in Theory and Practice, Crowley defined Magick as [...] "the Science and Art of causing change to occur in conformity with Will". He also told his disciple Karl Germer that [...] "Magick is getting into communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane than ours. Mysticism is the raising of oneself to their level." [...] Crowley saw Magick as a third way between religion and science, giving The Equinox the subtitle of [...] "The Method of Science; the Aim of Religion". Within that journal he expressed positive sentiments toward science and the scientific method, and urged magicians to keep detailed records of their magical experiments, [...] "The more scientific the record is, the better". His understanding of magic was also influenced {{by the work of}} the anthropologist James Frazer, in particular the view that magic was a precursor to science <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> evolutionary framework. Unlike Frazer however, Crowley did not see magic as a survival from the past that required eradication, but rather he believed that magic had to be adapted to suit the new age of science.|$|E
