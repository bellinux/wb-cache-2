5|$|After eight years, <b>Fetter</b> {{returned}} to academia and finally completed his B.A. in 1891. In 1892, Jeremiah W. Jenks—who had taught <b>Fetter</b> at Indiana University—acquired a teaching position at Cornell University {{at the new}} President White School of History and Political Science and subsequently secured a fellowship for <b>Fetter</b> at that institution. <b>Fetter</b> completed his Master of Philosophy degree the same year. Jenks then convinced <b>Fetter</b> to study, as Jenks himself had, under Johannes Conrad at the Sorbonne in Paris, France. <b>Fetter</b> earned his Ph.D. in 1894 from the University of Halle in Germany, where he wrote his doctoral dissertation, a critique of Malthusian population theory.|$|E
5|$|After {{earning his}} {{doctoral}} degree, <b>Fetter</b> accepted an instructorship at Cornell, but quickly left after being offered {{a position as}} a professor at Indiana University. In 1898, Stanford University lured him away from Indiana, but <b>Fetter</b> resigned from Stanford three years later over a dispute regarding academic freedom. After leaving Stanford in 1901, <b>Fetter</b> went back to Cornell, where he remained for ten years. In 1911, he again found himself in professional transition, accepting the position of chairman in an interdisciplinary department at Princeton University which incorporated history, politics, and economics. <b>Fetter</b> was the first chairman of Princeton University's Department of Economics and Social institutions.|$|E
5|$|Frank <b>Fetter</b> {{was born}} in Peru, Indiana to a Quaker family {{during the height of}} the American Civil War. <b>Fetter</b> proved an able student as a youth, as {{demonstrated}} by his acceptance to Indiana University in 1879 when he was only sixteen years old. At Indiana, he joined the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity. <b>Fetter</b> was on track to graduate with the class of 1883, but left college to run his family's bookstore upon news of his father's declining health. Working in the bookstore offered an opportunity for the young man to acquaint himself with some of the economic ideas that would later prove formative. Chief among the intellectual influences <b>Fetter</b> encountered at this time was Henry George's Progress and Poverty (1879).|$|E

5000|$|SVU-200 Flying Tiger (Fei-Hu or Feihu, 飞虎) is an {{unmanned}} helicopter {{developed by}} Sunward. The general designer of SVU-200 Flying Tiger is Mr. Dennis <b>Fetters,</b> {{the founder of}} Revolution Helicopter Corporation and later <b>Fetters</b> Aerospace LLC after coming out his retirement. SVU-200 Flying Tiger is an upgrade of Star-Lite unmanned helicopter developed by Dennis <b>Fetters</b> and his <b>Fetters</b> Aerospace LLC with various minor improvements and as a result, the two unmanned helicopters look very similar externally, with only minor difference. For example, <b>Fetters</b> Star-Lite lacks the horizontal stabilizer above the tail rotor that is present on SVU-200.

It crosses Chancery Lane and <b>Fetter</b> Lane to reach Ludgate Circus by the London Wall. The road ahead is Ludgate Hill. The street numbering runs consecutively from west to east south-side and then east to west north-side. It links the Roman and medieval boundaries of the City after the latter was extended. The section of Fleet Street between Temple Bar and <b>Fetter</b> Lane is part of the A4, a major road running west through London, although it once ran along the entire street and eastwards past St Paul's Churchyard towards Cannon Street.|$|E

On July 4, 2009, during festivities marking the town's 375th anniversary, American Consul-General David <b>Fetter</b> symbolically repaid the debt to the Ursulines with a payment of C$130.|$|E

5|$|The English {{common law}} {{position}} that a public body cannot <b>fetter</b> its discretion by abdicating its responsibility and powers to another was discussed and adopted in Lines International. The general rules that Justice Prakash enunciated {{in the case}} are that, first, a public body has the duty to exercise discretion by itself; it cannot abdicate this responsibility by taking orders from other bodies unless it is under a legal duty to do so. Therefore, a condition in its policy {{that appeared to be}} a direction by the PSA to itself to take orders from either the Gambling Suppression Branch ("GSB") of the Singapore Police Force or STPB to deny berths to cruise vessels was a <b>fetter</b> on PSA's exercise of discretion and was held to be invalid. However, the invalid condition alone did not mean that the PSA had in fact fettered its discretion. The High Court stated that while the PSA had agreed to take orders from the GSB and STPB {{on the basis of the}} invalid condition, whether it had in fact done so was another matter. On the evidence, the Court went on to find that the PSA had in fact made its own decision in the matter.|$|E

5|$|When {{a public}} {{authority}} <b>fetters</b> its discretion, it {{can either be}} said to have failed to exercise its discretionary power or to have been subject to external influences. In the Singapore High Court decision Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997), two distinct forms of <b>fettering</b> of discretion were recognized: <b>fettering</b> of discretion through rigid adherence to a policy, and <b>fettering</b> of discretion by an unlawful delegation of authority. These two forms of <b>fettering</b> of discretion have been said to represent two elements defining the concept of discretion in administrative law – the first form relates to freedom of choice, and second form the notion of one's personal discretion.|$|R
