5|$|Latin sources {{add that}} Oenopion {{was the son}} of Dionysus. Dionysus sent satyrs to put Orion into a deep sleep so he could be blinded. One source tells the same story but {{converts}} Oenopion into Minos of Crete. It adds that an oracle told Orion that his sight could be restored by walking eastward and that he <b>found</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> by hearing the Cyclops' hammer, placing a Cyclops as a guide on his shoulder; it does not mention Cabeiri or Lemnos—this is presumably the story of Cedalion recast. Both Hephaestus and the Cyclopes were said to make thunderbolts; they are combined in other sources. One scholion, on a Latin poem, explains that Hephaestus gave Orion a horse.|$|E

5|$|René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle (1643–87) was a French explorer. In 1682, La Salle led a canoe {{expedition}} {{to explore the}} Mississippi River basin. The expedition landed to hunt, when one of their members went missing. The armorer Pierre Prudhomme was assumed captured by Chickasaw Indians. La Salle decided to stay and search for the missing member. La Salle had a stockade built and named it Fort Prudhomme, after their lost man. This was the first structure built by the French in Tennessee. Days later, the missing member <b>found</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back. Prudhomme had lost his way while hunting. The expedition reached {{the mouth of the}} Mississippi River on April 6, 1682.|$|E
5|$|In October, Wegmann rode to sixth {{place in}} his native Germany in the mass finish to the Sparkassen Giro. The next day, trainee rider Rüdiger Selig won a {{selective}} sprint finish at Binche–Tournai–Binche, beating out former Tour de France green jersey winner Baden Cooke and a field including seven first-division teams. Viganò nearly joined him on the podium, taking fourth place. Zaugg then showed signs of his coming late-season form at the Giro dell'Emilia, finishing in ninth place 33 seconds back of the solo winner. The team took two top-ten places at the next day, at concurrent races, the GP Bruno Beghelli and Paris–Tours. At the Italian race, Monfort <b>found</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> into a winning breakaway that formed as the morning's initial breakaway was caught, eventually finishing the day in 7th place, 21 seconds behind the winner Filippo Pozzato. At {{the same time in}} France, O'Grady rode to an 8th-place finish behind 's Greg Van Avermaet.|$|E
5|$|The Oberon's log {{reveals that}} the apes on board, led by Semos, {{organized}} a mutiny and {{took control of the}} vessel after it crashed. The human and ape survivors of the struggle left the ship and their descendants are the people Leo has encountered since landing. The apes arrive and attack the humans who have gathered to see Leo, although he is able to even the odds when he uses the Oberons last fragments of fuel to fire a final blast at the first wave of apes. The battle is halted as a familiar vehicle descends from the sky and is identified immediately by Leo. The pod is piloted by Pericles, the chimp astronaut. Pericles was pushed forward in time as Leo was, and had just now <b>found</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the planet. When Pericles lands and the pod opens, the apes interpret his arrival as the return of Semos, the first ape, who is their god. They bow, and hostilities between humans and apes suddenly cease.|$|E

5|$|The {{flagship}} of the Russian Pacific squadron, Bogatyr under Rear Admiral Andrey Alexandrovich Popov, officially made {{a friendly}} visit to Melbourne in early 1863. According to information {{passed on to}} Australian authorities in June 1864, Rear Admiral A.A. Popov had {{in the first half}} of the year 1863 received orders and a plan of attack on the British naval ships positioned near the Australian shore. The plan also included shelling and destruction of the Melbourne, Sydney and Hobart coastal batteries. The information was attributed to the Polish lieutenant Władysław Zbyszewski of the Bogatyr, who had deserted from service in Shanghai soon after Bogatyr left Australia, and <b>found</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to Paris to join the Polish January Uprising. This information about Popov's plans was forwarded by a fellow Pole, a certain S. Rakowsky. Similar attack orders are known to have been given to the Atlantic squadron under Rear Admiral Lessovsky, that was sent to New York at the same time.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the words}} of the art critic Marco Livingstone, Arikha [...] "bridged the modernist avant-garde of pure {{abstraction}} with traditions of observational drawing and painting stretching back to the Renaissance and beyond.

60|$|A {{few days}} after their arrival at Acre, the king gave orders for the embarcation of the troops.

50|$|In Vasilyev’s early works, such as After a Thunderstorm (1868), Near a Watering Place (1868) and others, one {{can feel}} the {{influence}} of the Barbizon school; it affected his art but never resulted in a non-creative borrowing of the motifs. Though, at first, Vasilyev was somewhat inferior technically to the Barbizon painters, most critics agree that he eventually <b>found</b> <b>his</b> own <b>way</b> of handling the subject. After a Rain (1869) and After a Rain. Country Road exceed in many respects the Barbizon stormy scenes in their expressiveness and deeply national sound.|$|R

He was about to accost the clerk at the desk, when somebody tapped him on the shoulder, and turning he saw Andrew Dilks.|$|R
5|$|Born to a music-loving family, Ravel {{attended}} France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire; he was {{not well}} regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the Conservatoire, Ravel <b>found</b> <b>his</b> own <b>way</b> as a composer, developing a style of great clarity, incorporating elements of baroque, neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz. He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, Boléro (1928), in which repetition {{takes the place of}} development. He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known.|$|R

25|$|Poésies, {{published}} in 1830, {{is a collection}} of 42 poems that Gautier composed at the age of 18. However, as the publication took place during the July Revolution, no copies were sold and it was eventually withdrawn. In 1832, the collection was reissued with 20 additional poems under the name Albertus. Another edition in 1845 included revisions of some of the poems. The poems are written {{in a wide variety of}} verse forms and show that Gautier attempts to imitate other, more established Romantic poets such as Sainte-Beuve, Alphonse de Lamartine, and Hugo, before Gautier eventually <b>found</b> <b>his</b> own <b>way</b> by becoming a critic of Romantic excesses.|$|R

50|$|Even {{though he}} knew about voice acting, Scott pursued the theater. He studied at Studio 58. After leaving, he tried to find acting jobs and worked as an Elvis impersonator for a short time.

5000|$|A {{year after}} his return to Majorca he had his first one-man show at the Palma Museum. Initially the Avant-garde, Art Brut and American {{abstract}} Expressionism (e.g. Pollock had {{a big impact on}} him) influenced Barceló's work, on the other hand he was always particularly interested in the Baroque paintings of Diego Velázquez, Tintoretto and Rembrandt. Dubuffet, who saw himself as a true anarchist, inspired Barceló in adopting an experimental attitude. Soon he <b>found</b> <b>his</b> own <b>way</b> of expression by simplifying and reducing different [...] "-isms" [...] of the last decades and reformulating themes and technical challenges, but he has never abandoned the sanctified rules of the conventional painting such as the [...] "chiaroscuro" [...] for example.
