So with a lower growth rate, the study aimed to determine the role of the food and <b>other</b> industries <b>sector</b> linkages with <b>other</b> <b>sectors</b> in Central Java, as well as determine the impact of changes in wages on output in the food and <b>other</b> industries <b>sector</b> in Central Java. Input-Out analysis is used to see the relationship between inputs and outputs as well as the multiplier of and for the food and <b>other</b> industries <b>sector.</b> The analysis in this study using the Input-Output Table of Central Java in 2008 off 88 sectors clasifications and then simplified into 10 sectors. The result of linkages analysis food and <b>other</b> industries <b>sector</b> is the Food and Other Industries have the greates number of forward linkages and backward linkages than the <b>other</b> <b>sectors.</b> The greatest number of forward linkages is the Food and <b>Other</b> Industries <b>sector</b> amount to 1, 1650 and the greatest number of backward linkages is the Food and <b>Other</b> Industries <b>sector</b> amount to 1, 5552. The greatest number of input multiplier is the Food and <b>Other</b> Industries <b>sector</b> amount to 5, 3847.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the first results of original empirical research on differences between public projects and projects in <b>other</b> <b>sectors.</b> First we will define {{the very concept}} of a public project, before presenting the results of research performed in over 60 countries. The research shows a greater complexity of managing public projects than of managing projects in <b>other</b> <b>sectors.</b> Relatively, in comparison to projects of <b>other</b> <b>sectors,</b> the most complicated public projects management areas are stakeholder management, procurement management, and communications management. These management areas therefore require that special training programs be developed in public institutions.

These industries are seen as both innovative in themselves and an input in innovation processes in <b>other</b> <b>sectors.</b> Yet few studies have tested these relationships. This article investigates these issues using large-scale survey data for London. Using four measures of product and process innovation, we find no evidence that London's creative industries are more innovative than <b>other</b> <b>sectors.</b> Yet, individuals doing creative occupations in <b>other</b> <b>sectors</b> are a robust driver of product innovation in London's firms. The results suggest that occupations performed in London {{may be an important}} driver of product innovation in the city, and firms in <b>other</b> <b>sectors</b> may use creative occupations to develop new products in the capital. This finding is supportive of policies attempting to stimulate the creative industries by integrating creative occupations into firms across the whole economy...|$|R

For instance, government policies in Australia are allowing for more {{deregulation of the}} student market while overseas universities are entering the Australian domestic market. In an environment of increasing uncertainty, sound strategic planning is important. Processes including benchmarking, environmental scanning, knowledge management and risk management can identify best practice and guide "strategic pursuit". Two approaches are suggested to assist universities. The first is to expand planning frameworks from within-sector to include cross-sector comparisons. The second is to use these processes not only towards strategic pursuit but also to learn from mistakes made in <b>other</b> <b>sectors,</b> that is, "strategic avoidance". To defend this approach, potential lessons which could be learnt by universities from <b>other</b> <b>sectors</b> are provided.
