40|$|The {{long-term}} {{stability of}} optical parametric chirped-pulse amplifiers is hindered by thermal path length drifts affecting the temporal pump-to-signal overlap. A kilowatt-pumped burst amplifier is presented delivering broadband 1. 4 mJ pulses with a spectral bandwidth supporting sub- 7 fs pulse duration. Active temporal overlap control {{can be achieved}} by feedback of optical timing signals from cross-correlation or spectral measurements. Using a balanced optical cross-correlator, we achieve a pump-to-signal synchronization with a residual jitter of only (46 ± 2) fs rms.

40|$|Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are an {{increasingly}} popular choice of {{platform for the}} implementation of cryptographic systems. Until recently, designers using FPGAs had less than optimal choices for a source of truly random bits. In this paper we extend a technique that uses on-chip jitter and PLLs to a much larger class of FPGAs that do not contain PLLs. Our design uses only the Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs) common to all FPGAs, and has a self-testing capability. Using the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>jitter</b> contained in digital circuits, we produce random bits at speeds of up to 0. 5 Mbits/second with good statistical characteristics.

40|$|The LHC Bunch Clock {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} accelerator signals delivered to the experiments. Being directly derived from the Radio Frequency driving the beams in the accelerator by a simple division of its frequency by a factor of 10, the Bunch Clock signal represents the frequency at which the bunches are crossing each other at each experiment. It is thus used to synchronize all the electronics systems in charge of event detection. Its frequency is around 40. 079 MHz, but varies with beam parameters (energy, particle type, etc) by a few hundreds of Hz. The present paper discusses the quality of this Bunch Clock signal in terms of jitter. It is in particular compared to typical requirements of electronic components of the LHC detectors and put in perspective with the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>jitter</b> of the beam itself, to which this signal is related...|$|E
40|$|Extremely {{high-speed}} ADCs (> 1 GSPS) {{demand a}} low-jitter sample clock {{in order to}} preserve Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). These 8 - and 10 -bit converters have best-case noise floors set by quantization noise. For an N-bit ADC sampling a full-scale sinusoid, the well known expression for SNR (in dB) is: SNR = 6. 02 N + 1. 76. This sets the best case noise floor for an 8 -bit ADC at − 49. 9 dBc. The noise floor degrades from this point due to factors such as jitter on the sample clock, <b>intrinsic</b> aperture <b>jitter</b> of the ADC, spurious components arising from non-linearities in the ADC quantizer, and other internal noise such as thermal noise. In this article, we look at the strategy for optimizing the performance of the sample clock based on PLL/VCO characteristics. This means minimizing overall integrated phase noise, which minimizes clock jitter. The Root-Mean-Square (RMS) jitter of the sample clock combines with the <b>intrinsic</b> RMS aperture <b>jitter</b> of the ADC in a root-sum-square fashion to produce a total affective jitter. Total RMS jitter is...|$|R

40|$|SummarySound-evoked spikes in the {{auditory}} nerve can phase-lock with submillisecond precision for prolonged periods of time. However, the synaptic mechanisms that enable this accurate spike firing remain poorly understood. Using paired recordings from adult frog hair cells and their afferent fibers, we show here that during sine-wave stimuli, synaptic failures occur even during strong stimuli. However, exclusion of these failures leads to mean excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes that {{are independent of}} Ca 2 + current. Given the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>jitter</b> in spike triggering, evoked synaptic potentials and spikes had surprisingly similar degrees of synchronization to a sine-wave stimulus. This similarity was explained by an unexpected finding: large-amplitude evoked EPSCs have a significantly larger synchronization index than smaller evoked EPSCs. Large EPSCs therefore enhance the precision of spike timing. The hair cells’ unique capacity for continuous, large-amplitude, and highly synchronous multiquantal release thus underlies its ability to trigger phase-locked spikes in afferent fibers...|$|E
40|$|We present 7 eclipse timings of the {{low mass}} X-ray binary EXO 0748 - 676 {{obtained}} with the USA experiment during 1999 - 2000 as well as 122 eclipse timings obtained with RXTE during 1996 - 2000. According to our analysis, the mean orbital period has increased by ~ 8 ms between the pre-RXTE era (1985 - 1990) and the RXTE/USA era (1996 - 2000). This corresponds to an orbital period derivative of P(orb) /(dP(orb) /dt) ~ 2 x 10 ^ 7 years. However, neither a constant orbital period derivative nor any other simple ephemeris provides an acceptable fit to the data: individual timings of eclipse centers have residuals of up to 15 or more seconds away from our derived smooth ephemerides. When we consider all published eclipse timing data including those presented here, a model that includes observational measurement error, cumulative period jitter, and underlying period evolution {{is found to be}} consistent with the timing data.

40|$|High-sensitivity {{radio-frequency}} {{observations of}} millisecond pulsars usually show stochastic, broad-band, pulse-shape variations intrinsic to the pulsar emission process. These variations induce jitter noise in pulsar timing observations; understanding {{the properties of}} this noise is of particular importance for the effort to detect gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays. We assess the short-term profile and timing stability of 22 millisecond pulsars {{that are part of}} the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array sample by examining intraobservation arrival time variability and single-pulse phenomenology. In 7 of the 22 pulsars, in the band centred at approximately 1400 [*]MHz, we find that the brightest observations are limited by <b>intrinsic</b> <b>jitter.</b> We find consistent results, either detections or upper limits, for jitter noise in other frequency bands. PSR J 1909 − 3744 shows the lowest levels of jitter noise, which we estimate to contribute ∼ 10 [*]ns root mean square error to the arrival times for hour-duration observations. Larger levels of jitter noise are found in pulsars with wider pulses and distributions of pulse intensities. The jitter noise in PSR J 0437 − 4715 decorrelates over a bandwidth of ∼ 2 [*]GHz. We show that the uncertainties associated with timing pulsar models can be improved by including physically motivated jitter uncertainties. Pulse-shape variations will limit the timing precision at future, more sensitive, telescopes; it is imperative to account for this noise when designing instrumentation and timing campaigns for these facilities...|$|E
40|$|We {{comment on}} the recent {{observation}} of a 115 -day modulation in the X-ray flux of the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 5408 X- 1, and in particular, the interpretation of this modulation as the orbital period. We suggest that this modulation may instead {{be due to a}} precessing jet, and is thus superorbital in nature. Comparing the properties of this ULX with those of the prototypical microquasar SS 433, we argue that NGC 5408 X- 1 is very similar to SS 433 : a hyper-accreting stellar mass black hole in a shorter-period binary. If the analogy holds, the 115 -day modulation is best explained by the still poorly-understood physics of inner-disc/jet precession and a longer observing baseline would be able to reveal an <b>intrinsic</b> phase <b>jitter</b> that is associated with such a precession. <br/...|$|R
40|$|In {{applications}} where multiple magnetic modulators {{are used}} to drive a single Linear Induction Voltage Adder (LIVA) or Linear Accelerator (LINAC), {{it is essential that}} the outputs of the modulators be synchronized. Output rise times are typically in the 10 ns to 20 ns range, often making it necessary to synchronize to within less than 1 ns. Microprocessor and electronic feedback schemes have been developed and demonstrated that achieve the required level of synchronization, however, they are sophisticated and potentially complex. In a quest for simplicity, this work seeks to determine the achievable level of modulator to modulator timing jitter that can be obtained with simple design practices and passive techniques.

However, {{the origins of the}} relative timing jitter in such systems are not fully determined, which in turn prevents the experimental efforts to optimize the synchronization performance. Here, we demonstrate, through theoretical modeling and numerical simulation, that the photodetection could be one physical origin of the relative timing jitter. Comparison with relative timing jitter due to the <b>intrinsic</b> timing <b>jitter</b> of the mode-locked laser is also demonstrated, revealing different qualitative and quantitative behaviors. Based on the nature of this photodetection-induced timing jitter, we further propose several strategies to reduce the relative timing jitter.

40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{progress}} of a femtosecond fiber timing distribution system for the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) [1 - 3] at SLAC to enable the machine diagnostic at the 10 fs level. The LCLS at the SLAC is the world’s first hard x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) with unprecedented peak brightness and pulse duration [1 - 3]. The time-resolved optical/x-ray pump- probe experiments at this facility open the era of exploring the ultrafast dynamics of atoms, molecules, proteins, and condensed matter [4 - 6]. However, the temporal resolution of current experiments {{is limited by the}} timing jitter between the optical and x-ray pulses [7, 8].

This allowed us to measure both the UV laser pulse train at 244 nm and the e-beam via optical transition radiation (OTR). Due to the low electron beam energies and OTR signals, we typically summed over 50 micropulses with 1 nC per micropulse. We also did electron beam bunch length vs. micropulse charge measurements to identify a significant e-beam micropulse elongation from 10 to 30 ps (FWHM) for charges from 1 to 4. 6 nC.

40|$|For {{the upgrade}} {{of the inner}} tracker of the BESIII spectrometer, planned for 2018, a {{lightweight}} tracker based on an innovative Cylindrical Gas Electron Multiplier (CGEM) detector is now under development. The analogue readout of the CGEM {{enables the use of}} a charge centroid algorithm to improve the spatial resolution to better than 130 Î¼m while loosening the pitch strip to 650 Î¼m, which allows to reduce the total number of channels to about 10 000. The channels are readout by 160 dedicated integrated 64 -channel front-end ASICs, providing a time and charge measurement and featuring a fully-digital output. The energy measurement is extracted either from the time-over-threshold (ToT) or the 10 -bit digitisation of the peak amplitude of the signal. The time of the event is generated by quad-buffered low-power TDCs, allowing for rates in excess of 60 kHz per channel. The TDCs are based on analogue interpolation techniques and produce a time stamp (or two, if working in ToT mode) of the event with a time resolution better than 50 ps. The front-end noise, based on a CSA and a two-stage complex conjugated pole shapers, dominate the channel <b>intrinsic</b> time <b>jitter,</b> which is less than 5 ns r. m. s. The time information of the hit can be used to reconstruct the track path, operating the detector as a small TPC and hence improving the position resolution when the distribution of the cloud, due to large incident angle or magnetic field, is very broad. Event data is collected by an off-detector motherboard, where each GEM-ROC readout card handles 4 ASIC carrier FEBs (512 channels). Configuration upload and data readout between the off-detector electronics and the VME-based data collector cards are managed by bi-directional fibre optical links.

40|$|Continuous-wave lasers locked to high-finesse optical {{reference}} cavities are oscillators {{that produce}} ~ 500 THz optical signals with unprecedented stability. Indeed, sub-femtosecond fractional frequency instability at one second averaging {{can now be}} achieved. A self-referenced femtosecond laser frequency comb (FLFC) {{is used as a}} frequency divider to provide a phase-coherent link between optical and microwave domains, dividing the frequency down to the gigahertz range while also transferring the stability of the original signal. Photodetectors then convert the optical pulses into electronic signals. The resultant 10 GHz microwave signals have ultra-low phase noise below - 100 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz offset, surpassing that of traditional microwave oscillators. This new approach offers significant improvement for many applications that rely on stable microwave signals, and may even create new measurement technologies otherwise unachievable with current signal sources. In reality, fundamental and technical sources of noise in each stage of the optical-to-microwave generation process limit the ultimate achievable stability of the signal. Optical reference cavities are limited by environmental effects and thermal fluctuations, and FLFC dividers suffer from <b>intrinsic</b> timing <b>jitter,</b> amplitude noise, and limited stabilization servo bandwidth. However, it is the seemingly straightforward photodetection of optical pulses that proves to be the limiting factor in the ultimate noise floor of these signals.

Pulse times of arrival (TOAs) are limited by stochastic processes {{that occur in the}} pulsar itself, along the line of sight through the interstellar medium, and in the measurement process. On timescales of seconds to hours, the TOA variance exceeds that from template-fitting errors due to additive noise. We assess contributions to the total variance from two additional effects: amplitude and phase <b>jitter</b> <b>intrinsic</b> to single pulses and changes in the interstellar impulse response from scattering. The three effects have different dependencies on time, frequency, and pulse signal-to-noise ratio. We use data on 37 pulsars from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves to assess the individual contributions to the overall intraday noise budget for each pulsar.

The International Pulsar Timing Array Collaboration undertook a 24 hr global observation of PSR J 1713 + 0747 in an effort to better quantify sources of timing noise in this pulsar, particularly on intermediate (1 - 24 hr) timescales. We observed the pulsar continuously over 24 hr with the Arecibo, Effelsberg, GMRT, Green Bank, LOFAR, Lovell, Nançay, Parkes, and WSRT radio telescopes. The combined pulse times-of-arrival presented here provide an estimate of what sources of timing noise, excluding DM variations, would be present as compared to an idealized √N improvement in timing precision, where N is the number of pulses analyzed.
