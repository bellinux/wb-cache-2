40|$|AbstractThe {{future of}} {{production}} systems {{is a big}} concern in Europe and particularly in France where two national initiatives were started in 2012 : a specific ministry of productive recovery and a specific scientific reflexion on research on production systems. A one-year work gave the main ideas for what is significantly moving in production systems to make them sustainable {{for a long time}} in a European country. It highlighted three main evolutions that would create the industry of the future quite different to the today manufacturing industry: at first, the production systems would be pulled by the development of the technologies with high added value that emerge from today; Then it was considered that the link of the systems of production and the territories would be a <b>heavy</b> <b>trend</b> of future and thus put forward the evolutions of the organization. Finally, it could be the revival of the social contract that would pull the evolution of the systems of production. The paper relates the first conclusions of this national work...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} deal with the <b>heavy</b> <b>trend</b> in size {{increase}} of volumetric datasets, research in isosurface extraction has focused {{in the past few years}} on related aspects such as surface simplification and load balanced parallel algorithms. We present in this paper a parallel, bloc-wise extension of the tan-dem algorithm [Attali et al. 2005], which simplifies on the fly an isosurface being extracted. Our approach minimizes the overall memory consumption using an adequate bloc splitting and merging strategy and with the introduction of a component dumping mecha-nism that drastically reduces the amount of memory needed for par-ticular datasets such as those encountered in geophysics. As soon as detected, surface components are migrated to the disk along with a meta-data index (oriented bounding box, volume, etc) that will al-low further improved exploration scenarios (small components re-moval or particularly oriented components selection for instance). For ease of implementation, we carefully describe a master and slave algorithm architecture that clearly separates the four required basic tasks. We show several results of our parallel algorithm ap-plied on a 7000 × 1600 × 2000 geophysics dataset...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Urban environments like city {{centers are}} {{recognized}} as one of the most complex systems for modeling. Because of their high density of big buildings as well as their complicated processes, there is the strong need for planning and managing properly. Here, the <b>heavy</b> <b>trend</b> towards web-enabled systems can help to improve communication, organization and decision-making in favor. In the field of urban environments, 2 D Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have proven to be a very useful tool. However, since real objects are in 3 D, GIS should offer sufficient functionality for dealing with the third dimension as well. Therefore, the intention of our research is to integrate 3 D GIS in web-orientated environments in order to provide appropriate applications to urban planners. The aim of this paper is to introduce the current status of Web 3 D GIS and most recent trends and developments. First, we will present technologies linked to web-enabled systems. Here, the field of distributed computing in relation to tasks in the field of Geo-Information is most interesting. Therefore, corresponding standards recommended by e. g. the Open GIS Consortium (OGC) will be discussed, too. After that, the paper focuses on 3 D data management and corresponding functionality. The third aspect is 3 D visualization for web-environments. Different techniques like VRML as well as the problematic task of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to access and query data will be clarified. Finally, the paper discusses bottlenecks of Web 3 D GIS and proposes new aspects to solve them. ...|$|E

AIDS-related health expenditures are incorporated as well. Using up-do-date optimal forecasting methods, the model applied to South Africa shows that while a relatively short term assessment might not reveal any dramatic AIDS growth e®ect, the medium/long run impact can be truly devastating.

40|$|Summary Aim: Few {{quantified}} data on work {{injuries are}} available {{on a regular basis}} for self-employed workers {{due to a lack of}} legislation and investigation. We designed a two months original survey in the PACA region of southern France. Our aims were first a better epidemiological knowledge of occupational accidents and second to evaluate the opportunity of sharing a common prevention program with salaried workers. Methods: The main ratio is made up of the work injury cases stemmed from regular wage replacement claims at the numerator; health insurance enrolment data provided the denominator. Circumstances were obtained by self administered questionnaires. Data from salaried population were implemented from a bibliographic research. Results: Independent workers’s incidence rate was 15 / 1000 person-years including 0, 67 / 1000 assaults and battery and 2, 47 / 1000 journey accidents. Male gender (OR 2, 058 and IC 95 % 1, 395; 3, 038) and working in the construction sector (OR 4, 849 and IC 95 % 2, 121; 11, 087) were significant risk factors. The lower rate than the salaried, which is 39 / 1000, suggests either a lower risk or under reporting or classification bias. Independent’s on duty journey accidents (1, 54 / 1000) occurred at a higher rate than salaried (1, 18 / 1000). Conclusion : Independents workers results show some <b>heavy</b> <b>trends</b> with higher level of violence, falls, or on duty traffic accidents. But in some lines of business, like the construction sector, where accidents are high, a common program of prevention could be justified. Prat Organ Soins. 2012; 43 (2) : 97 - 1...|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, {{black people}} were part of the psychedelia and early <b>heavy</b> metal <b>trends,</b> {{particularly}} by way of the ubiquitous Beatles' influence and the electric guitar innovations of Jimi Hendrix. Hendrix was among the first guitarists to use audio feedback, fuzz, and other effects pedals such as the wah wah pedal to create a unique guitar solo sound. Psychedelic soul, a mix of psychedelic rock and soul began to flourish with the 1960s culture. Even more popular among black people and with more crossover appeal, was album-oriented soul in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which revolutionized African-American music. The genre's intelligent and introspective lyrics, often with a socially aware tone were created by artists such as Marvin Gaye in What's Going On, and Stevie Wonder in Songs in the Key of Life.|$|R
25|$|Wraight {{has written}} that the three {{surviving}} Cristofori pianos appear to follow an orderly progression: each has heavier framing than its predecessor. Wraight suggests that {{this would have been}} intentional, in that the heavier framing permitted tenser, thicker strings. This in turn increased the volume with which treble notes could be played without pitch distortion, a limitation that Wraight observes when playing replica instruments. Thus, it appears that the move toward <b>heavier</b> framing, a <b>trend</b> that dominates the history of the piano, may already have begun in Cristofori's own building practice.|$|R

40|$|This thesis reviews heavy mineral {{separation}} {{techniques for}} red-bed heavy mineral provenance studies. It demonstrates {{the effectiveness of}} automated mineralogy for mineral comparisons and targeted mineral analysis, resulting in new provenance history conclusions for the Permo-Triassic of SW England. The methodology was developed to remove iron-oxide coatings from grains and provide optimal separation of heavy mineral concentrates in comparison to hydroseparation and panning. Step-wise methodology iterations were validated at each stage using the QEMSCAN (Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals by SCANing electron microscopy). The QEMSCAN works {{in a similar way}} to the SEM (scanning electron microscope) and electron-microprobe. Four EDS (energy dispersive spectroscopy) detectors measured X-rays, secondary electrons and back-scattered electrons from the sample. The software allocated these to defined geochemical SIP (species identification protocol) categories. The SIP was back-validated using the electron-microprobe, XRD (X-ray diffraction), microscopy and SEM. QEMSCAN was the primary analysis technique. The results included false colour mineral maps and semi-quantitative statistics for the SIP categories. This enabled targeted mineral analysis with supporting techniques. The methodology was applied to the Permo-Triassic of SW England. The QEMSCAN was able to pick up small scale and large scale <b>heavy</b> mineral provenance <b>trends.</b> Case study 1 showed regional <b>heavy</b> mineral <b>trends</b> and allowed lithological correlation of outliers. Case study 2 used heavy minerals to confirm contemporaneous structural evolution and the base of the Upper Permian in South Devon. Case study 3 allowed a re-evaluation of the base Triassic. Case study 4 targeted biotite minerals at Corbyn’s Head. Case study 5 reviewed local vertical and horizontal trends in comparison to regional trends. This has significant oil and gas exploration implications as it gives confidence in correlating deposits over 10 s km and can be applied to North Sea barren red-beds. Finally, some mineral firsts, including rammelsbergite and a topaz rhyolite were identified...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of long–term heavy metal {{concentrations in the}} Gulf of Palermo {{was carried out in}} this study. Measurements of Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn concentrations were performed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) on dated fractions of a sediment core, dated by the 210 Pbex method. They are found to cover a time period from 1951 to 2004. The constant sedimentation rate model was used for dating. Specific activities of 137 Cs have also been measured in the sediment core sections as a check of the time scale derived by the 210 Pbex method. A time-series analysis based on temporal decomposition was used in order to investigate the presence of <b>heavy</b> metal pollution <b>trend.</b> The additive component model, widely used to estimate seasonal and long–term behavior, was chosen for the temporal analysis. Results showed the presence of a specific <b>heavy</b> metal concentration <b>trend.</b> Residual time–autocorrelation has also been taken into account in order to investigate their stochastic properties. Concentrations of some metals (Cu, Hg, and Zn) have been found increasing until the beginning of the 1970 s. A peak around the beginning of the 1980 s has been found for Cr and Pb. Heavy metal concentration in the sediment core show a significant decreasing after these years. Our results for the concentration time trends are in good agreement with other surveys performed in different areas of the world, and they can be explained in terms of the reduction of anthropogenic contribution to atmospheric emissions. Further investigations on time properties and spatial distributions, are also planned...|$|R

However, variation cultivars of water spinach are likely to have a different range of heavy metal accumulations as recorded by He et al. (2014) and Alia et al. (2015). The high accumulations of Zn and Cu that were found in the roots of both water spinach and okra was possibly due to the translocation these metal ions from soil into the roots because Zn and Cu are required micronutrients that are routinely taken by plants for life processes (Hopkins 1999; Mengel et al. 2001).|$|R

30|$|Crop land {{expansion}} due {{to increase}} in intensity of agriculture in the forested catchment areas, sediment load from tributaries from the catchment areas, siltation inflow to the lake and marshland transformed into agricultural areas as hydroponic expansion are major determinants of reduced wetland area in the study site. Our study showed that Inle Lake is experiencing an expansion of cropland by 268  km 2 from 1989 to 2014. Similar significant changes have also been reported on the lake and its surrounding catchments by many earlier studies (Ma 1967; Thiha 2005; Htwe et al. 2015; Pradhan et al. 2015). Thus, it symbolizes a continuous transformation in size of the lake. Additionally, sediment load from tributaries amounting 2.63106  m 3 /year (Su and Jassby 2000) and siltation from inflowing stream equivalent to 6, 23, 000  m 3 /year clearing the natural vegetation for cultivation (Akaishi et al. 2006) are other factors in shrinking wetland area. Also, our result was supported by an estimated decline of open water surface in Inle Lake by 32.4 % between 1935 and 2000 (Sidle et al. 2007). Furthermore, houses and restaurants built inside lake with poor sanitation and improper management of waste are also adding challenges {{on the health of}} the lake (ADB 2006; May 2007; San and Rapera 2010; Lwin and Sharma 2012). Simultaneously, the <b>heavy</b> rainfall <b>trend</b> (DMH 2016) has increased the rate of landslide impacting the lake further.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this review is to summarise the characteristics, significance and evolution of heavy minerals and their accumulations, and to identify the key controls on the development and distribution of heavy mineral concentrations in alluvial systems.

The models are structured from the broadest scale of target selection, down to the local scale of sample site selection. The major conclusion of this work is that an understanding of process geomorphology is required to develop genetic models of placer development, including a detailed evaluation of climatic fluctuations throughout the Caenozoic. Palaeoplacers such as the Witwatersrand goldfield, are inferred to have formed under similar circumstances of tectonic setting as genetically comparable Caenozoic placers such as those of Otago, New Zealand.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Juxtaposition {{of modern}} pocket beach sands, Pleistocene Run terrace sands, and Eocene Coaledo {{sandstones}} at Cape Arago, Oregon, provides a natural setting for studying changes in grain shape as produced by surf action. If the Eocene sandstones {{can be shown}} to be the predominant sediment source:[or both the Holocene and the t'leistocene deposits, then measured ifferences between shape parameters of quartz grains from the older sandstones and those from the more recently deposited sediments may be attributed to the effects of surf action. Mean roundness and mean sphericity were measured on a total of 13, 153 quartz grains (1. 50 ¢ size) collected from three separate pocket beaches, the Whisky Run sands, and the Coaledo sandstones. Principal components analysis, a multivariate computer technique, was applied to shape data and supplementary size and <b>heavy</b> mineral data. <b>Trends</b> revealed by this analysis show that the sands of one pocket beach (Beach One) are sufficiently {{similar to those of the}} bedrock to indicate a definite genetic relationship. Statistical comparison tests of average mean roundness values for quartz grains from the Coaledo bedrock and those from Beach One indicate that the beach grains have undergone a statistically significant increase in roundness.

MethodsWe reviewed hospitalizations from 2001 to 2003 at all inpatient facilities in Bondo District, Kenya. ResultsDiarrhea was responsible for 11. 2 % (n= 2158) of hospitalizations. The annual incidence was 550 and 216 per 100000 persons aged < 5 and ≥ 5 years, respectively. The incidence was highest in infants (1138 per 100000 persons), decreased in older children, peaked again among 20 – 29 -year-olds (341 per 100000), and declined among those ≥ 65 years (157 per 100000). Female adults had higher incidence than males (rate ratio= 1. 84, 95 % CI 1. 61 – 2. 10). Incidence decreased with distance from the district referral hospital (4. 5 % per kilometer, p< 0. 0001) and from the nearest inpatient facility (6. 6 % per kilometer, p= 0. 012). Case-fatality was high (8. 0 %), and was higher among adults than young children. Co-diagnosis with malaria, pneumonia, HIV, and tuberculosis was common.

Existing industrial techniques for the purification of waste water are expensive. A cheaper alternative may be 'bioremoval', that is, the accumulation and concentration of pollutants from aqueous solutions using biological material. The adsorption of copper, zinc and cadmium using two dried seaweeds Ecklonia maxima and Laminaria pallida (order Laminariales) and Kelpak waste (also made from Ecklonia maxima), a byproduct from the manufacture of the seaweed concentrate Kelpak, were investigated under laboratory conditions, to determine some factors affecting heavy metal adsorption. Ion adsorption from single and mixed metal ion solutions of 10 mgl− 1 and 100 mgl− 1 containing copper, zinc and cadmium were tested at various temperatures and pH. Optimum adsorption occurred at pH 3 and pH 7 and Kelpak waste had equal or superior adsorption ability to dried Ecklonia maxima and Laminaria pallida, particularly for copper.

Am J Epidemiol 1998; 148 : 671 - 82. back pain; body mass index; education; income; occupations; smoking; workload Back pain is a common and disabling condition among the general population of the industrialized world (1 - 7). The societal costs of back disorders are high (8) because of early retirement, sick leaves, and the frequent usage of health services (1, 2, 9 - 12). Yet, little is known about time trends in the prevalence of back pain (13, 14). Socioeconomic factors affect health greatly, as has been shown in several studies from different countries...|$|R
40|$|The Posidonia Shale Fm in the Dutch Central Graben is {{well known}} for its high {{concentration}} of orgnic matter. The preservation of organic matter previously have been explained by permanent anoxic conditions and restricted water conditions. Recent studies have shown, however, that low energy settings or quiet water conditions and the subsequent suspension settling are not a prerequisite for deposition of muds and shales, but that depositional energy condition are commonly sufficiently high to rework and advect the sediment. In order to effectively determine the lithofacies variability within a succession it is important to make observations of grain-size, determine the origin of individual components, and make microtextural observations of the rock. Therefore, this study uses a combination of optical, electron optical and geochemical analyses of unusually thin (< 20 µm) polished thin sections to show that the Posidonia Shale Fm is deposited by multiple depositional mechanisms in a dynamic fine-grained siliclastic environment. The thin section analyses shows that the Posidonia Shale Fm is characterised by a stacked succession of mud-sized dominated thin beds often characterised by three-fold internal stratigraphy. These thin beds have an erosional base with on top a silt-dominated unit which is either gradually fining upwards or arranged in low angle laminae. The second unit consists of lamina sets of clay and silt dominated layers which are either horizontal or curved and vary from continuous to discontinuous. The uppermost unit, which is predominantly recognised in {{the upper part of the}} Posidonia Shale Fm, is homogeneous and clay dominated. Furthermore, the upper part of the Posidonia Shale Fm is characterised by carbonate micro concretions and a high abundance of pyrite. The geochemical analyses show a concomitant negative carbon isotope excursion, increase in TOC concentration and an increasingly <b>heavier</b> sulphur isotope <b>trend</b> in the upper part of the Posidonia Shale Fm. Furthermore, redox and productivity proxies are enriched in this part of the succession. This typical vertical trend in each thin beds suggests that the sediment-water interface was located below the fair-weather wave base, but in relatively shallow water above the storm wave base. Anoxic conditions below the sediment-water interface prevailed in the lower part of the Posidonia Shale Fm and extended to anoxic to sulphidic bottom water conditions in the upper part of the Posidonia Shale Fm. The three-fold internal stratigraphy, however, shows that these conditions were interrupted by short events, possibly by storm induced wave activity, and the subsequent inflow of oxygen-rich surface waters. The Posidonia Shale Fm is, thus, deposited in a dynamic fine-grained siliclastic environment with an alternation of anoxic and short-term oxic conditions...|$|R
