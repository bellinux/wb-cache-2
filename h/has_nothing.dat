5|$|Later, Pete {{talks about}} his despair at the day's events with Don in the elevator, {{wondering}} how the fight occurred, when {{he thought they were}} all friends. Close to tears, he blurts out that he <b>has</b> <b>nothing.</b> Don doesn't respond.|$|E
5|$|An {{applicant}} has {{the burden}} of proving that a legislative restriction on {{the freedom of speech}} <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with public order, public health or morality. There must be some substance in the applicant's complaint – the Government does not have an immediate duty to justify making a decision that restricts the applicant's right to freedom of speech simply because the applicant complains of an alleged infringement of Article 15(1).|$|E

5|$|As Vladimir Bukovsky and Semyon Gluzman point out, it is {{difficult}} for the average Soviet psychiatrist to understand the dissident's poor adjustment to Soviet society. This view of dissidence <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> surprising about it—conformity reigned in Soviet consciousness; a public intolerance of non-conformist behavior always penetrated Soviet culture; and the threshold for deviance from custom was similarly low.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{wakes up}} from the {{nightmare}} to find his family beside his bed. Marge assures him he <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to be afraid of, but a green fog seeps {{in through the window}} and the Simpsons are turned inside out. They, along with Willie, perform a musical number over the end credits, but Bart is dragged away and eviscerated by Santa's Little Helper.|$|E
5|$|Regarding Stiller's long wins, Tim Krabbé {{struck a}} similar note: A {{grandmaster}} wouldn't {{be better at}} these endgames than someone who had learned chess yesterday. It's a sort of chess that <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with chess, a chess that we could never have imagined without computers. The Stiller moves are awesome, almost scary, because you know they are the truth, God's Algorithm – it's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't understand one word.|$|E

5|$|The smaller {{of the two}} cocks-of-the-rock, {{the male}} Guianan takes the lesser part in breeding. It is {{polygynous}} and <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with nesting once mating is done. The male's energy instead is devoted to very elaborate display rituals that show off its magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where 40 or more males may gather to challenge rivals and beckon to the females.|$|E
5|$|When {{the science}} {{projects}} are due, Terrance presents a monkey with five pairs of buttocks, but Kyle <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> until the pig {{gives birth to}} a pot-bellied pig that looks like Mr. Garrison, implying the pig was impregnated by Mr. Garrison before the elephant. Garrison quickly awards it first prize over Terrance's monkey.|$|E
5|$|Although Mex and Violeta Urtizberea are {{father and}} daughter, Violeta {{accepted}} {{a role in}} the series without knowing that her father was also part of the cast and asked him to respect her space. Although they played characters of similar ages, they rarely have joint scenes. Julieta Ortega said that she <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> in common with her character in the series. Juan Gil Navarro, who appeared in the television drama La Dueña at the same time, said that although he does not normally appear in comedies he followed his wife's suggestion.|$|E

5|$|Clara {{volunteers to}} speak to Skaldak to try and calm him, {{relaying}} the Doctor's words to Skaldak, though {{he knows that the}} Doctor is listening. The Doctor informs Skaldak he was encased in the ice for 5000 years. Skaldak laments the loss of his daughter and his people; however, the Doctor tries to comfort him with the knowledge that the Ice Warriors still live, just not on Earth or Mars. Skaldak escapes from his armour - an act of great dishonour - and stops broadcasting the signal to the other Ice Warriors because he believes himself to be the only one of his kind left. The Doctor surmises that, thinking himself to be the last of his kind, Skaldak <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> left to lose. He manages to grab and kill three members of the crew.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to files}} {{recovered}} by Fisher in London (and made public by the president), the American public and Congress both believe that Iran is funding the Blacklist, and The United States and Iran are headed towards war. Looking for more solid proof of Iran's involvement, Fisher infiltrates Quds Force headquarters in Tehran(previously a U.S embassy). Inside, he discovers that Iran <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to do with}} the Blacklist, and that the files he recovered were planted by The Engineers in order to lure The United States into a war. Fisher narrowly escapes Tehran by using a Predator Drone to blow up the Iranian vehicles chasing him, causing an international incident.|$|E
5|$|In America, Angier meets {{scientist}} Nikola Tesla {{and asks}} him to build him the machine Tesla built for Borden. While waiting for Tesla to finish, Angier deciphers Borden's diary, which he discovers to be fraudulent: Borden confesses that Tesla <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to do with}} Borden's trick and that Borden ordered Olivia to give Angier the diary to send him away. Angier confronts Tesla, who admits to never having built any device for Borden but has successfully built a replicating machine for Angier, capable of reproducing animate and inanimate objects {{a distance from the}} machine. As Tesla departs, he advises Angier to destroy the machine.|$|E

5|$|In the station, Dive Coasters {{that use}} non-floorless trains simply use a {{standard}} station. With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to load and unload the train, a movable floor is necessary. Because the front row <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> in front of it to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. When the next train enters the station, the gate is closed and the floors are brought back up where the next riders board.|$|E
5|$|During lunch, Mark (Paul Schneider) tells Leslie that he {{is going}} to propose to Ann (Rashida Jones). Ann {{suggests}} that Leslie get some sleep, but she plans on consuming Sweetums bars to stay awake for another 24 hours. As the telethon begins, Leslie is already exhausted and is falling asleep. With time to kill, Tom brings Detlef to the Snakehole Lounge, but the owner, Freddy (Andy Milder), refuses to let him go because Detlef is bringing a lot of business, delaying Leslie's big headliner. Andy's (Chris Pratt) band, Mouse Rat, is asked to replace Detlef, but when they complete all of their songs, Leslie <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> else to put on the air. Ron (Nick Offerman) volunteers to demonstrate how to cane a chair, but his presentation is so boring that the telethon actually starts to lose money.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, chief {{architect}} and Surveyor-General to James I, Inigo Jones, surveyed {{the area and}} introduced the local Portland stone to London; using it in his Banqueting House, Whitehall, and for repairs on St Paul's Cathedral. His successor, Sir Christopher Wren, the architect and Member of Parliament for nearby Weymouth, used six million tons of white Portland limestone to rebuild destroyed parts of the capital after the Great Fire of London of 1666. Well-known buildings in the capital, including St Paul's Cathedral and the eastern front of Buckingham Palace feature the stone. After the First World War, a quarry was opened by The Crown Estate to provide stone for the Cenotaph in Whitehall and half a million gravestones for war cemeteries, and after the Second World War {{hundreds of thousands of}} gravestones were hewn for soldiers who had fallen on the Western Front. Portland cement <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with Portland; it was so named due to its similar colour to Portland stone when mixed with lime and sand.|$|E

5|$|Mega Man and Bass begin a final {{confrontation}} with Dr. Wily in his newly regained laboratory. When Wily is beaten, Bass demands {{to know why}} he deceived him. Wily explains that he created King simply to test Bass' abilities. Wily shows him written plans for making a newer version of King to join with Bass in this venture, promising that the two would be invincible together. Proto Man appears and immediately destroys these plans. Wily then demands Bass to destroy Proto Man, but Bass is unsure. It was then Proto Man tells Bass that although he is a strong robot of free will, he can never defeat his rival because he <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> for which to fight. Bass doesn't care and forces Proto Man to leave, saying that he will still destroy Mega Man to prove his cause. Mega Man returns home where his sister Roll presents him a letter from King, who has somehow escaped the destruction of his castle. King wishes to atone for his own crimes against humans and hopes {{for them to be}} friends if they were to meet in the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a Floorless Coaster has one main {{difference}} from traditional steel roller coasters around the world: it has no floors between the seats. While a train is in the station, a floor is used only for loading and unloading purposes. Because the front row <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> {{in front of it}} to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. The gate then opens, allowing the train to move forward. When the train returns to the station, the floor is brought back up and the gate is closed as the next riders board the roller coaster. Aside from the station, a Floorless Coaster has several inversions similar to B's Sitting Coasters.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{visit the}} local Quahog bank so that Brian can deposit holiday {{money in his}} safe deposit box. Stewie then {{wants to go to}} a store to return a $3,000 Thom Browne sweater. While they are still inside the vault, the door closes {{at the end of the}} work day and locks them inside until the next morning. Frightened, Stewie soils his diaper. Worried he will get a rash from the dirty diaper, Stewie desperately tries to make Brian eat his feces by {{threatening}} him with a gun that Brian had stored in his deposit box. They discover that Stewie has a cellphone in his pocket, but there's only enough charge in the battery for one short phone call. Unfortunately, Stewie uses the last of the phone's battery charge to call the clothing store rather than for help. Enraged, Brian hits Stewie, throws his phone on the ground (thus breaking the phone), and yells at Stewie, making him cry. Instantly remorseful and wanting to repair his relationship with Stewie, Brian reluctantly agrees to eat Stewie's feces in order to provide him with a clean diaper and make up for making Stewie cry. While watching Brian eating, Stewie becomes nauseated and throws up; Stewie then convinces Brian to eat his puke, correctly pointing out that Brian likes the taste of vomit. Realizing that he <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to clean his bottom with, Stewie manages to convince Brian to clean his bottom with his tongue in order to avoid infection, much to Stewie's pleasure. Afterward, they both decide to take a nap, but soon they realize that the next day is Sunday, meaning that they will have to wait another day before they can be released from the vault.|$|E
