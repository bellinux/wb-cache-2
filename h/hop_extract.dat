40|$|For decades, MBT (3 -methyl- 2 -buten- 1 -thiol) {{is known}} as the {{compound}} responsible for the lightstruck off-flavour in beer. This leads many brewers to adapt the procedures by using reduced <b>hop</b> <b>extracts.</b> Unfortunately, other off-flavours including onion-defects often characterize these “light stable” beers. In the present work, a commercial lager beer which did not contain isohumulones (blend of dihydroisoalpha acids; bottled in clear glass) was submitted to various natural aging. Whereas no MBT-defect (skunky-like) was detected by sensorial analyses, a strong “onion-like” off-flavour was evidenced in the samples exposed to light. GC-PFPD and GC-O analyses of global (XAD) and thiol specific (pHMB) extracts allowed us to identify 2 -sulphanyl- 3 -methylbutanol (2 S 3 MBol) as the key-off-flavour (AEDA Flavour Dilution = 32 – 1024 for 2 S 3 MBol while only 8 – 64 for MBT). 2 S 3 MBol revealed to be synthesized from 3 -methyl- 2 -buten- 1 -ol (MBOH) found in <b>hop</b> <b>extracts.</b> The involved radicalar mechanism is strongly enhanced by light.

Material and Methods: In this study, pieces of isolated rat's ileum were mounted in the internal chamber of an organ bath which was filled with Tyrode’s solution and tightly tied to the lever of an isotonic transducer. The contractile responses were recorded by using an oscillograph device. In the presence of normal saline and different concentrations of hops (0. 1, 0. 3, and 0. 5 mg/ml), the amplitude of contractions induced by 10 - 12 up to 10 - 2 M acetylcholine was determined.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of <b>hops</b> <b>extract</b> on sexual hormone levels and sexual dynastic cells in Syrian adult male mice. Materials and Methods: This experimental study was performed on 40 Syrian adult male mice that were divided into 5 groups of 8 : two controls groups and three experimental groups receiving various doses of <b>hops</b> <b>extract</b> (50, 100 and 150 mg/kg).

40|$|Since lipid {{auto-oxidation}} during wort boiling is a determining for {{the appearance}} of staling flavour in aged beers, we have investigated the reducing power of hops added in the boiling kettle. An assay based on the inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation {{in the presence of}} an initiator [2, 2 '-azobis(2 -amidino-propane) dihydrochloride = AAPH] enabled us to distinguish hop varieties and conditionings. Large differences in hop flavanoid contents explained the higher antioxidant activity of low-cr-acid samples versus bitter varieties and CO 2 <b>hop</b> <b>extracts.</b> As expected, adding hop pellets to the kettle effectively increased the overall reducing activity of wort. Supercritical CO 2 <b>hop</b> <b>extracts</b> had no significant effect due to their extremely low level of polyphenols. The concentration of the very well-known marker of beer ageing, trans- 2 -nonenal, was lower in boiled wort exhibiting a better reducing power. The AAPH reducing power test applied to hops or worts was thus efficient to predict the nonenal synthesis during boiling. Hop varieties and conditionings emerged from this work as key-parameters for improving the reducing power of wort and the flavour stability of the final product. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Fining {{agents are}} used in the {{clarification}} of beers; they help to reduce the time required to sediment suspended yeast cells and ensure the clarity and colloidal stability of beer. Following an adventitious observation during dry-hopping experiments, we identified a fining activity associated with Saaz <b>hops.</b> <b>Extracts</b> of <b>hop</b> cones were subsequently shown to have the capacity to flocculate yeast and result in their sedimentation. This activity has since been identified in extracts of many different hop varieties and, significantly in spent hops, the co-product resulting from commercial extraction of hops with either CO 2 or ethanol. Here we illustrate the activity of the novel finings <b>extracted</b> from spent <b>hops</b> following CO 2 extraction of Galena hops. The sediments formed on fining were compact, relative to those obtained when commercial isinglass was used to fine the same beers. The <b>hop</b> <b>extracts</b> were also effective in reducing 90 ° haze in beers under conditions designed to mimic both cask ale (12 [*]°C) and lager (4 [*]°C) type applications. The compounds responsible for the fining activity appear to be large (30 – 100 [*]kDa, or more) polyphenols. Analysis of the polyphenols using colourimetric tests indicated the presence of proanthocyanidins. On acidic hydrolysis these generated cyanidin, which would be derived from a polymer composed of catechin and epicatechin subunits. The presence of these materials in spent hops offers the possibility to develop commercial products, with desirable fining properties, from an existing co-product stream.

40|$|Background: Humulus lupulus(hops) {{have long}} been used in beer brewing for their {{antimicrobial}} and bittering properties. Hops contain alpha acids, which during the boiling process of beer, get isomerized into iso-alpha-acids also called isohumulones. Research has postulated that daily supplementation with concentrated <b>hop</b> <b>extract</b> could help to reduce visceral obesity in healthy overweight adults. The goal of this systematic review is to summarize recent research on <b>hop</b> <b>extract</b> {{and its role in}} reducing visceral obesity. Methods: An exhaustive search of the available medical literature was performed using MEDLINE-Ovid, Web of Science, CINAHL, and MEDLINE-PubMed. Keywords included hops, <b>hop</b> <b>extract,</b> humulus lupulus, isohumulones, alpha acids, iso-alpha-acids, matured hop bittering acids, alpha-acid axides, mature <b>hop</b> <b>extract,</b> visceral obesity, obesity, and beer. Articles that were relevant were assessed for quality using GRADE. Results: Six articles were found after an exhaustive search of the literature. Two studies fit the criteria and were used for this systematic review. Both studies were randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trials. Each study was conducted in an outpatient research setting utilizing matured or isomerized <b>hop</b> <b>extract</b> in the form of capsules or liquid drink. Using computed tomography, both studies successfully showed a reduction in visceral obesity utilizing <b>hop</b> <b>extract</b> on a day-to-day basis. Dose dependent improvement in reduction of visceral obesity was shown in one study. Conclusion: Utilizing isomerized or matured <b>hop</b> <b>extract</b> on a day-to-day basis can help reduce visceral obesity in overweight healthy adults. The most benefits are seen with dosages greater than 38 mg per day of isomerized <b>hop</b> <b>extract</b> and at least 35 mg of matured <b>hop</b> <b>extract.</b> Given the ease of creation of <b>hop</b> <b>extract,</b> it should be considered as an adjunctive treatment to diet and exercise for visceral obesity.

The most important virulence factors of Brucella are related to their capability of intraphagocytic survival.

The present study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of <b>hops</b> <b>extracts</b> against Brucella abortus 544 and B. melitensis 16 M. Materials and methods: <b>Hops</b> <b>extracts</b> were prepared in water, acetone and ethanol. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) for two strains of Brucella determined by broth macrodilution and agar well diffusion methods. Effect of extracts on intramacrophge surviving of Brucella strains studied on cell culture of mouse peritoneal macrophages. Results: Results indicated that MIC for aqueous extract was 1 : 80 (0. 625 mg/ml) and for acetonic and ethanolic extracts was 1 : 160 (0. 05 mg/ml). MBC for aquatic extract was 1 : 40 (1. 2 mg/ml) and for two other extracts was 1 : 80 (0. 1 mg/ml).
