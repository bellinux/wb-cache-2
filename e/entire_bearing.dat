50|$|The {{distance}} from one parting {{edge to the}} other is slightly larger than the corresponding distance in the housing so that a light amount of pressure is required to install the bearing. This keeps the bearing in place as {{the two halves of}} the housing are installed. Finally, the shell's circumference is also slightly larger than the housing circumference so that when the two halves are bolted together the bearing crushes slightly. This creates a large amount of radial force around the <b>entire</b> <b>bearing,</b> which keeps it from spinning. It also forms a good interface for heat to travel out of the bearings into the housing.|$|E
50|$|As with {{standard}} roller chains, self-lubricating roller chains consist of five basic parts: inner plates, outer plates, pins, bushes, and rollers. However, the bushes for self-lubricating chains are sintered metal bushes. Sintered-metal self-lubricating bearings {{are based on}} powder-metallurgy technology. They are economical, suitable for high production rates and can be manufactured to precision tolerances.Specifically, alloyed powdered metal is mixed, then compacted to form the bushing. The initial compaction {{to a large degree}} dictates the density, shape, dimensions, and mechanical properties of the finished part.The bushings are then sintered.Sintered materials have inherent porosity and the presence of pores have both beneficial and detrimental role on the part performance. The pores act as stress concentration zones and reduce the mechanical strength and ductility. However, the presence of pores acts also contribute to the reduction in noise and vibration also serve as lubricant pockets in lubricated contacts. Sintered bearings and gears are also used in many applications where the external lubrication is not possible or not preferred.It is essential that the pores form an interconnected system of controlled size and volume, so that oil is supplied to the <b>entire</b> <b>bearing</b> surface. The rate of oil supply automatically increases with temperature and, therefore, with increasing speeds of rotation, to achieve optimum working conditions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Wire {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (Wire EDM) cutting of flexures for a rotary flexural bearing fabrication is developed. The results of FEA calculation and theoretical analysis show {{that one of the}} main factors affecting flexures ’ machining is the weak torsional stiffness of the bearing cage, thus excessive deflections due to machining stress, heat generation and spark-induced vibrations may occur. To minimize flexure deflection during the machining process, a specially designed fixture is utilized. Other technical measures, including residual stress relief before and after Wire EDM cutting, reasonable cutting sequence planning, multiple-cutting (i. e., rough cut followed by several trim cuts) etc., are also adopted for cutting. Dimensional accuracy of ± 5 µm was obtained over the 150 µm thickness for the bearing flexures, a variation of less than 3 µm was achieved for the flexures of opposing sides, and surface roughness of better than Ra 0. 3 µm was obtained for the flexures of the <b>entire</b> <b>bearing</b> cage.

30|$|To {{overcome}} the drawbacks of orifice restrictors, {{the use of}} porous restrictors and multiple restrictors are reported. Panzera and Otsu showed {{that the use of}} a porous material as the bearing restrictor had the benefit of more uniform pressure distribution over the <b>entire</b> <b>bearing</b> surface, which created higher load capacity, stiffness, damp, and wider stability [22, 23]. Charki et al. [24] found that the stiffness of aerostatic bearings with multiple restrictors could be improved because of the smaller pressure drop near the gas inlet. Published literatures reveal that there are not comprehensive studies considering the influences of different restrictor characteristics on the stiffness and stability of aerostatic bearings. Compared to orifice restrictor, porous restrictors and multiple restrictors were designed to improve the stability and stiffness of aerostatic circular pad bearings in this paper. Taking into account that both the stiffness and the stability of aerostatic bearings were determined by the internal pressure distribution characteristics, the pressure distribution in the bearing clearance of three different restrictors was studied using CFD. The influence of film thickness, orifice diameter, and material parameters on the stiffness and stability of the aerostatic circular pad bearings was also investigated. In addition, the accuracy of the numerical simulation results was verified by the experimental data.|$|E

The {{interaction between the}} rotating and stationary parts in the bearing causes a conversion {{of some of the}} power into heat, influencing the thermal behaviour of the <b>entire</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber. To improve thermal modelling of bearing chambers, this work focused on modelling of the heat generated and dissipated around the bearings, in terms of magnitude and location, and the interaction with the components/systems in the bearing chamber. A thermal network model and a finite element model of an experimental high-pressure shaft ball bearing and housing were generated and a comparison to test rig results have been conducted. Nevertheless, the purpose of the thermal matching process that focused on the finite element model and experimental data is to provide a template for predicting temperatures and heat transfers for other bearing models. The result of the analysis shows that predictions of the thermal network are considerate, despite the simplifications. However, lower relative errors were obtained in the finite element model compared to the thermal network model. For both methods, the highest relative error is seen to occur during transient (acceleration and deceleration). This observation highlights the importance of boundary conditions and definitions: surrounding temperatures, heat split and the oil flow, influencing both the heat transfer and heat generation. These aspects, incorporated in the modelling and benchmarked with experimental data, can help facilitate other related cases where there is limited or no experimental data for validation...|$|E

40|$|Aero-engines {{incorporate}} various bearing {{chambers and}} these typically contain bearings, seals, rotating shafts, stationary walls and struts, and sometimes gears. Oil is supplied for lubrication and cooling and is removed (scavenged) from the sump {{region of the}} chamber (note that {{in some parts of}} the world the <b>entire</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber is referred to as the sump). Depending on the location and function of the bearing chamber, the sump region may be deep or shallow. Effective oil removal is essential as unnecessary working of the oil can lead to excessive heat generation and reduced overall efficiency. Therefore the design of the scavenge region in a bearing chamber, as well as the ability to assess its performance is very important. Previous work, much of which was conducted at the University of Nottingham Technology Centre in Gas Turbine Transmission Systems (UTC) suggests that oil often does not flow cleanly into the off-take due to a combination of several factors: oil momentum, windage, three-dimensional air flow that blocks the off-take flow or transports oil away from the off-take, and pooling because of separated air flow that acts on the oil once oil momentum is dissipated. Experimental research at the UTC found that scavenge performance is highly affected by the sump geometry, especially its depth. Variations of shallow sumps, although some are better than the others, cannot offer the same level of performance as a deep one. However space limitation in an engine often only allows for a shallow sump. This paper presents some experimental exploration on new design ideas. They are in the form of various inserts and attachments that were designed to improve scavenge performance of a shallow sump. These “custom” sumps were tested on the UTC’s scavenge test facility at various flow settings (wall film/flying droplets, liquid flow rates, scavenge ratios, shaft speeds). The residence volumes were measured and compared to a baseline configuration with reduction in residence volume desirable. The inserts tested were a Grille Cover, a Stepped Spillway, a Perforated Plate and a Porous Insert.

Cam deformity was defined as an alpha angle at 1 : 30 o'clock position over 60 ° and/or at 3 : 00 o'clock position over 50. 5 °. Hip cartilage was segmented and divided into four regions of interest (ROIs) : anterolateral, anteromedial, posterolateral and posteromedial quadrants. Mean T 1 ρ value of the <b>entire</b> weight <b>bearing</b> cartilage in hips with a cam deformity (34. 0 [*]±[*] 4. 6 [*]ms) was significantly higher compared to control hips (31. 3 [*]±[*] 3. 2 [*]ms, p[*]=[*] 0. 050). This difference reached significance in the anterolateral (p[*]=[*] 0. 042) and posteromedial quadrants (p[*]=[*] 0. 041). No significant correlation between the alpha angle and T 1 ρ values was detected. The results indicate cartilage damage occurs in hips with a cam deformity before symptoms occur. A significant difference in T 1 ρ values was found in the anterolateral quadrant, the area of direct engagement of the deformity, and in the posteromedial quadrant.

Good design practice which accounts for dynamic characteristics in the modelling of a motion system warrants higher performance precision machines and cuts down redevelopment effort to ‘patch’ inherent shortcoming of the machine dynamics. This research aimed to accurately describe the non-linear dynamics of a non-mechanical contact aerostatic guideway system {{in order to achieve}} an accurate FEA model of the design stage. The single axis aerostatic guideway is comprised of several machine in¬terfaces that impact the dynamic behaviour of the guideway. Modelling each air bear¬ing pad by a single stiffness element is not adequate to predict the guideway modal behaviour accurately. The aerostatic guideway has been broken down into several key machine interface elements. In-depth investigation of the air film and the air bearing mounting mechanism was carried out.

A bearing backing plate is first machined and surface-ground to produce flat and parallel faces. Partial-arc slots needed to retain the foil components are then machined into the plate by wire electrical discharge machining. Slot thicknesses achievable by a single wire pass are appropriate to accommodate the practical range of foil thicknesses, leaving a small clearance in this hinged joint to permit limited motion. The backing plate is constructed from a nickel-based superalloy (Inconel 718) to allow heat treatment of the <b>entire</b> assembled <b>bearing,</b> {{as well as to}} permit hightemperature operation. However, other dimensionally stable materials, such as precipitation-hardened stainless steel, can also be used for this component depending on application. The top and bump foil blanks are cut from stacks of annealed Inconel X- 750 foil by the same EDM process. The bump foil has several azimuthal slits separating it into five individual bump strips. This configuration allows for variable bump spacing, which helps to accommodate the effects of the varying surface velocity, thermal crowning, centrifugal dishing, and misalignment. Rectangular tabs on the foil blanks fit into the backing plate slots. For this application, a rather traditional set of conventionally machined dies is selected, and bump foil blanks are pressed into the dies for forming.

40|$|An {{approach}} is developed that simplifies calculation of the dynamic characteristics of a self-acting, gas-lubricated slider bearing system. This technique avoids a lengthy simultaneous solution of the equations of motion of the slider and the time-dependent Reynolds' equation, while providing additional design information that is otherwise unobtainable. The equilibrium pressure distribution in the gas film is obtained using the BunovGalerkin formulation of the finite element method. By considering small perturbations of the slider bearing system about equilibrium, two coupled, second-order partial differential equations are derived, which define the in-phase and out-of-phase perturbation pressures in the gas film. These perturbation pressures are integrated to obtain the frequency dependent, non-symmetrical stiffness and damping matrices for the slider bearing. Using the stiffness and damping properties of the gas bearing and slider support, the equations of motion for the <b>entire</b> slider <b>bearing</b> system are derived. The frequency dependence of the stiffness and damping matrices renders the eigenvalue problem nonlinear, and the eigensolutions are obtained iteratively using Brent's method. Because of the non-symmetrical stiffness and damping matrices, a similarity transformation based {{on the left and}} right modal matrices is used to decouple the equations of motion. This decoupling is approximate because of the frequency dependence of the stiffness and damping matrices, but the resulting damped natural frequencies are shown to be in excellent agreement with published experimental data. Fractions of critical damping obtained for several slider geometries also successfully predict observed instabilities. The mode shapes of slider oscillation, unobtainable with other methods, permit calculation of the center of rotation for the coupled, pitch-heave modes; this information can be used to determine the optimum location for the magnetic transducer. Closed-form solutions are obtained for the response to disk surface displacement, and for the response to a random force applied to the slider body. These forced-response solutions are useful in identifying the critical parameters of slider design. ...|$|R

To date, the function of cochlin and the mechanism of pathogenesis of the mutations are unknown. We have used the biological system of transient transfections of the entire protein coding region of COCH into several mammalian cell lines, to investigate various functional properties of cochlin. By western blot analysis of lysates prepared from transfected cells, we show that cochlin is a secreted protein. Immunocytochemistry shows concentrated localisation of cochlin in perinuclear structures consistent with the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, showing intracellular passage through these secretory compartments. We detected that cochlin is proteolytically cleaved between the FCH/LCCL domain and the downstream vWFA domains, resulting in a smaller cochlin isoform of ~ 50 kDa. Interestingly, this isoform lacks the <b>entire</b> mutation <b>bearing</b> FCH/LCCL domain. We have also shown that cochlin is N-glycosylated in its mature secreted form. Previous studies of the FCH/LCCL domain alone, expressed in bacteria, have demonstrated that three of four DFNA 9 mutations cause misfolding of this domain. Characteristic eosinophilic deposits in DFNA 9 affected inner ear structures could {{be the result of}} aberrant folding, secretion, or solubility of mutated cochlins, as in certain other pathological states in which misfolded proteins accumulate and aggregate causing toxicity. To examine the biological consequences of cochlin misfolding, we made separate constructs with three of the DFNA 9 mutations and performed parallel studies of the mutated and wild type cochlins. We detected that mutated cochlins are not retained intracellularly, and are able to be secreted adequately by the cells, through the Golgi/ER secretory pathway, and also undergo proteolytic cleavage and glycosylation. These results suggest that DFNA 9 mutations may manifest deleterious effects beyond the point of secretion, in the unique environment of the extracellular matrix of the inner ear by disrupting cochlin function or interfering with protein-protein interactions involving the FCH/LCCL domain. It is also possible that the mutations may result in aggregation of cochlin in vivo over a longer time course, as supported by the late onset and progressive nature of this disorder...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{practical}} and verifiable prognostic approaches for {{gas turbine engine}} bearings will {{play a critical role}} in improving the reliability and availability of legacy and new acquisition aircraft engines. In addition, upgrading current United States Air Force (USAF) engine overhaul metrics based strictly on engine flight hours (EFH) and total accumulated cycles (TAC) with higher fidelity prognostic models will provide an opportunity to prevent failures in engines that operate under unusually harsh conditions, and will help avoid unnecessary maintenance on engines that operate under unusually mild conditions. A comprehensive engine bearing prognostic approach is presented in this paper that utilizes available sensor information on-board the aircraft such as rotor speed, vibration, lube system information and aircraft maneuvers to calculate remaining useful life for the engine bearings. Linking this sensed data with fatigue-based damage accumulation models based on a stochastic version of the Yu-Harris bearing life equations with projected engine operation conditions is implemented to provide the remaining useful life assessment. The combination of health monitoring data and model-based techniques provides a unique and knowledge rich capability that can be utilized throughout the <b>bearing’s</b> <b>entire</b> life, using model-based estimates when no diagnostic indicators are present and using the monitored features such as oil debris and vibration at later stages when failure indications are detectable, thus reducing the uncertainty in model-based predictions. A description and initial implementation of this bearing prognostic approach is illustrated herein, using bearing test stand run-to-failure data and engine test cell data...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{patterned}} {{media is}} a new approach proposed to extend the recording densities of hard disk drives beyond 1  Tb/in. 2. Bit-patterned media (BPM) overcome the thermal stability problems of conventional media by using single-domain islands for each bit of recorded information, thereby eliminating the magnetic transition noise (Albrecht et al., Magnetic Recording on Patterned Media, 2003). Considering steady state conditions, we have transferred the pattern from the disk surface onto the slider surface and have investigated the pressure generation due to the bit pattern. To reduce the numerical complexity, we have generated the bit pattern only {{in the areas of}} the slider near the trailing edge, where the spacing is small. Cylindrical protrusions were modeled using very small mesh size on the order of nanometers to obtain the flying characteristics for the <b>entire</b> slider air <b>bearing</b> surface (ABS) using the “CMRR” finite element Reynolds equation simulator (Duwensee et al., Microsyst Technol, 2006; Wahl et al., STLE Tribol Trans, 39 (1), 1996). The effect of pattern height, pattern diameter, slider skew angle, and slider pitch angle on flying height of a typical slider is investigated. Numerical results show that the flying height decreases for a patterned slider and the change in flying height {{is a function of the}} pattern height and ratio of the pattern diameter to the pattern pitch. In comparison to discrete track media, the flying height loss is larger for a patterned slider disk interface for the same recessed area of pattern...|$|R
40|$|The {{bearing chamber}} of an {{aeroengine}} houses roller bearings and other structural parts. The spatial limitation, high operational speeds of the HP shaft and the {{proximity to the}} combustion chamber can make the operating conditions of the bearing chamber challenging. A roller bearing consists of an inner race, an outer race and a cage constraining a number of rolling elements. In the aeroengine application, oil is introduced into the bearing chamber via the inner race regions of the bearing into the rolling elements interstices. This provides lubrication for the roller bearings. The source of heat in the bearing chamber is mainly from rolling contact friction and the high temperature of combustion. Cooling results from the oil transport within the bearing chamber and thus an efficient transport of oil is critical to maintaining {{the integrity of the}} <b>entire</b> structure. The <b>bearing</b> chamber contains the oil which is eventually scavenged and recycled for recirculation. Experiments have been conducted over the years on bearing chamber flows but often simplified to create the best emulation of the real aeroengine. The complexity of the bearing chamber structure is also challenging for experimental measurements of the oil characteristic in the roller bearing elements and the bearing chamber compartment. Previous experiments have shown that the oil continuum breaks up in the bearing chamber compartment but it is not quantitatively clear how and what parameters affect these. Previous simulation attempt of bearing chamber, also, have been limited by the boundary conditions for the oil. This work presents a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) transient simulation of flow in the bearing sector in an attempt create boundary conditions for such models. The current results show that the oil emerges in the form of droplets into the bearing chamber compartment with speed of the order of 10 % of the shaft rotation...|$|R
