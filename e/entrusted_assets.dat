Economic management, the key term, is treated in a very broad sense, i. e. including legal regulations addressing related areas of accounting, salaries and taxes. Comparison of former and current legal regulation lies in the focus of the thesis, also included is an assessment of practical impacts of changes induced by recent private law recodification. The thesis also brings quite a few practical examples, showing application of both former and current legal regulation. The thesis comprises seven chapters. The first, prologue chapter, presents the object and goal of the thesis. The second chapter presents definitions of general legal terms used in the area of joint ownership of dwellings. The general term economic management of the association is also presented here as comprising two separate areas, those areas being assets management and cash management. The third chapter deals with association's assets management, focusing on administration of <b>entrusted</b> <b>assets,</b> i. e. of the land plots and common elements of the building.

5000|$|Embezzlement {{differs from}} larceny in two ways. First, in embezzlement, an actual {{conversion}} must occur; second, the original taking {{must not be}} trespassory. To say that the taking was not trespassory {{is to say that}} the person(s) performing the embezzlement had the right to possess, use, and/or access the assets in question, and that such person(s) subsequently secreted and converted the assets for an unintended and/or unsanctioned use. Conversion requires that the secretion interferes with the property, rather than just relocate it. As in larceny, the measure is not the gain to the embezzler, but the loss to the asset stakeholders. An example of conversion is when a person logs checks in a check register or transaction log as being used for one specific purpose and then explicitly uses the funds from the checking account for another and completely different purpose. It is important to make clear that embezzlement is not always a form of theft or an act of stealing, since those definitions specifically deal with taking something that does not belong to the perpetrator(s). Instead, embezzlement is, more generically, an act of deceitfully secreting assets by one or more persons that have been <b>entrusted</b> with such <b>assets.</b> The person(s) <b>entrusted</b> with such <b>assets</b> {{may or may not have}} an ownership stake in such assets.|$|R

Jefferson recommended his friend John Hartwell Cocke, who also opposed slavery, as executor, but Cocke likewise declined to execute the bequest.

40|$|On its surface, Jesus’ Parable of the Talents is {{a simple}} story with four key plot elements: (1) A master is leaving on a long trip and <b>entrusts</b> {{substantial}} <b>assets</b> to three servants to manage during his absence. (2) Two of the servants invested the assets profitably, earning substantial returns, but a third servant — frightened of his master’s reputation as a hard taskmaster — put the money away for safekeeping and failed even to earn interest on it. (3) The master returns and demands an accounting from the servants. (4) The two servants who invested wisely were rewarded, but the servant who {{failed to do so}} is punished. Neither the master nor any of the servants make any appeal to legal standards, but it seems improbable that there was no background set of rules against which the story plays out. To the legal mind, the Parable thus raises some interesting questions: What was the relationship between the master and the servant? What were the servants’ duties? How do the likely answers to those questions map to modern relations, such as those of principal and agent? Curiously, however, there are almost no detailed analyses of these questions in Anglo-American legal scholarship...|$|R

In line with the revitalization, the issues of measuring and managing waqf performance are growingly being discussed and concerned by the academicians and constituents. Waqf institutions need to demonstrate their performance as whether they have effectively and efficiently managed in order to discharge their accountability to various waqf stakeholders. There are many studies conducted to measure the performance of various organizations in the private, public and third sector. However, studies on the performance measurement of waqf institution are still limited, and financial ratios become the dominant measurement in those studies. Being a non-profit in nature and religious entity, managing the <b>entrusted</b> waqf <b>assets</b> for social and economic development of the society, the performance measurement of waqf institutions should also focus on realizing their missions. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to discuss both financial and non-financial measurement that can be adapted by waqf institutions to assess their performance in discharging their accountability. Drawing from the experience on performance measurement discussed in the non-profit organizations literatures, this conceptual paper is hoped to provide significant insight on how waqf institutions performance may be measured and provide a tool to benchmark the best practices that can guide them to achieve their goals and missions...|$|R

30|$|Threat {{modeling}} is {{a procedure}} to optimize security by identifying objectives and vulnerabilities and then defining counter measures {{to prevent or}} mitigate {{the effects of the}} threats present in the system. There are three approaches to threat modeling - they are attacker centric, software centric and asset centric. Attacker centric threat modeling starts with an attacker and evaluates their goals. Software centric threat modeling starts from the design of a system and attempts to step through a model of the system looking for various attacks against each element of the node. Asset centric threat modeling involves starting from <b>assets</b> <b>entrusted</b> to a system. Since threats associated with the system must be identified, software centric approach is suitable for MBST because the entire system design is to be processed for different types of attacks present in the system. There are different types of threat modeling processes which are used to identify threats and to identify stakeholder's risk. There are two different Microsoft threat modeling processes are STRIDE and DREAD. STRIDE is an acronym of six types of threats; Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service and Elevation of Privilege. It is used to identify both technical and non-technical threats. DREAD stands for Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users and Discoverability. It is used for rating threats and also for quantifying, comparing and prioritizing the amount of risks associated with each threat. There is another threat modeling framework, similar to STRIDE and DREAD, called TRIKE. It is mainly used to reduce stake holder's risk.|$|R
40|$|Acconding to Weber, the Calvinistic {{pastor in}} his {{practice}} changed {{the idea of}} calling in its specific aspect while he was managing the idea in the doctrine {{and also in the}} original religious mind of its beliver: in making the idea of calling acceptable to rank and file, the pastor dropped from it the non-or even anti-profit moment and added in this place the con-profit one, thus directing the tremendous energy of the religious mind towards moulding the spirit of the modern capitalism as the ideal of ascetic ethic in the worldly life. The idea of calling so revised is found 'ideal-typically' in English Puritanism, especially in the work of Baxter. He stressed the ceaseless lure of wealth to moral corruption and neglection of ascetic life. However, though his hostility to property was much more strong and strict than that of Calvin himeself, Baxter's doubt was directed not to wealth as it was but to its degrading effect on morality, to idleness and enjoyment of life and resulting resignation of the efforts to holly life for the glory of God. For Baxter the toil in one's calling was on the one hand the means for asceticism : it was the prominent guard against all the temptation to unclean life; it was on the other just the divine purpose of human life. A specific job as a calling was given to each person secretely by God, so it was his duty to search for this and work hard in this to contribute to the rational formation of society and to the 'common best' in order to be pleased bv God. The liberation from the old restriction and the freedom of the selection of one's job, which Luther could not had admitted, exerted then the amazing influence on constituting the rational labour system both in business and society as a whole. This idea of Barter familiar with utilitarianism shows a peculiar religious aspect, when he sets on it the motives of stableness and of order or method of one's job as his calling, - the motives which lead to the appreciation of the modern professinals. And the more methodically one's ascetic labour is executed the more it yields profit as its result, so became the profit {{to be used as a}} measure with practical importance of the degree of one's service to God, and then profit-making to be the very duty of a Puritan as a steward <b>entrusted</b> the <b>assets</b> of God, - the religious appreciation of profit-making, the brilliant glory for business man, which was the strong support of the ethic for the spirit of the modern capitalism...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{tries to}} display a {{comprehensive}} and comparative study of the different legal and regulatory problems involved in international securitization transactions. First, an introduction to securitization is provided, with {{the basic elements of}} the transaction, followed by the different varieties of it, including dynamic securitization and synthetic securitization structures. Together with this introduction to the intricacies of the structure, a insight into the influence of securitization in the financial and economic crisis of 2007 - 2009 is provided too; as well as an overview of the process of regulatory competition and cooperation that constitutes the framework for the international aspects of securitization. The next Chapter focuses on the aspects that constitute the foundations of structured finance: the inception of the vehicle, and the transfer of risks associated to the securitized assets, with particular emphasis on the validity of those elements, and how a securitization transaction could be threatened at its root. In this sense, special importance is given to the validity of the trust as an instrument of finance, to the assignment of future receivables or receivables in block, and to the importance of formalities for the validity of corporations, trusts, assignments, etc., and the interaction of such formalities contained in general corporate, trust and assignment law with those contemplated under specific securitization regulations. Then, the next Chapter (III) focuses on creditor protection aspects. As such, we provide some insights on the debate on the capital structure of the firm, and its inadequacy to assess the financial soundness problems inherent to securitization. Then, we proceed to analyze the importance of rules on creditor protection in the context of securitization. The corollary is in the rules in case of insolvency. In this sense, we divide the cases where a party involved in the transaction goes bankrupt, from those where the transaction itself collapses. Finally, we focus on the scenario where a substance over form analysis may compromise some of the elements of the structure (notably the limited liability of the sponsor, and/or the transfer of assets) by means of veil piercing, substantive consolidation, or recharacterization theories. Once these elements have been covered, the next Chapters focus on the regulatory aspects involved in the transaction. Chapter IV is more referred to “market” regulations, i. e. those concerned with information disclosure and other rules (appointment of the indenture trustee, and elaboration of a rating by a rating agency) concerning the offering of asset-backed securities to the public. Chapter V, on the other hand, focuses on “prudential” regulation of the entity <b>entrusted</b> with securitizing <b>assets</b> (the so-called Special Purpose vehicle), and other entities involved in the process. Regarding the SPV, a reference is made to licensing requirements, restriction of activities and governance structures to prevent abuses. Regarding the sponsor of the transaction, a focus is made on provisions on sound originating practices, and the servicing function. Finally, we study accounting and banking regulations, including the Basel I and Basel II Frameworks, which determine the consolidation of the SPV, and the de-recognition of the securitized asset from the originating company’s balance-sheet, as well as the posterior treatment of those assets, in particular by banks. Chapters VI-IX are concerned with liability matters. Chapter VI is an introduction to the different sources of liability. Chapter VII focuses on the liability by the SPV and its management for the information supplied to investors, the management of the asset pool, and the breach of loyalty (or fiduciary) duties. Chapter VIII rather refers to the liability of the originator as a result of such information and statements, but also as a result of inadequate and reckless originating or servicing practices. Chapter IX finally focuses on third parties entrusted with the soundness of the transaction towards the market, the so-called gatekeepers. In this respect, we make special emphasis on the liability of indenture trustees, underwriters and rating agencies. Chapters X and XI focus on the international aspects of securitization. Chapter X contains a conflicts of laws analysis of the different aspects of structured finance. In this respect, a study is made of the laws applicable to the vehicle, to the transfer of risks (either by assignment or by means of derivatives contracts), to liability issues; and a study is also made of the competent jurisdiction (and applicable law) in bankruptcy cases; as well as in cases where a substance-over-form is performed. Then, special attention is also devoted to the role of financial and securities regulations; as well as to their territorial limits, and extraterritoriality problems involved. Chapter XI supplements the prior Chapter, for it analyzes the limits to the States’ exercise of regulatory power by the personal and “market” freedoms included in the US Constitution or the EU Treaties. A reference is also made to the (still insufficient) rules from the WTO Framework, and their significance to the States’ recognition and regulation of securitization transactions. ...|$|R
