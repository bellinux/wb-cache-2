5000|$|The <b>Foxglove</b> <b>aphid,</b> (Aulacorthum solani), {{also known}} as Glasshouse-potato aphid, is an aphid in the {{superfamily}} Aphidoidea in the order Hemiptera. It is a true bug and sucks sap from plants.|$|E
40|$|Several small-plot {{studies were}} {{conducted}} {{in the spring of}} 2003 to compare the residual efficacy of several new reduced risk insecticides with a number of conventional aphicide compounds on head lettuce and romaine. Our efforts were primarily directed at determining efficacy against the <b>foxglove</b> <b>aphid,</b> a newly discovered pest in Yuma. In general, several new neonicotinoid foliar compounds provided good residual control of all aphid species including <b>foxglove</b> <b>aphid.</b> Other new compounds were less consistent. Admire, the standard soil systemic used in lettuce, was inconsistent against <b>Foxglove</b> <b>aphid</b> providing 85 - 90 % control relative to > 95 % control against other aphid species present in the plots. Conventional aphid compound such as Capture, dimethoate, endosulfan, Orthene and MSR consistently provided good, economic control of Foxglove aphids in both head and romaine lettuce. Based on the results of these and previous studies, a sampling procedure and action threshold are recommended for <b>foxglove</b> <b>aphid</b> control in desert lettuce...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies were}} {{conducted}} {{during the past two}} growing season to examine the population growth, distribution and damage potential of the <b>foxglove</b> <b>aphid</b> on head lettuce in the Yuma Valley. Light populations of foxglove aphids were first found colonizing untreated head lettuce in small experimental plots at the Yuma Agricultural Center in the spring of 2001. In the spring of 2002 foxglove aphids reached high population levels at YAC on spring plantings, but were not reported in commercial fields. This past spring <b>foxglove</b> <b>aphid</b> populations were wide-spread throughout the Yuma Valley, particularly in fields near the Colorado river, adjacent to citrus orchards and residential areas, and not treated with Admire. Experimental studies suggested that foxglove aphids can reach economic levels on desert head lettuce, particularly crops planted during late November and December...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of planting dates on aphid {{population growth in}} head lettuce was measured over a 5 year period to identify planting windows during the season when lettuce is at risk from aphid infestations. Small, untreated 0. 2 acre plantings of head lettuce were established beginning in October with final harvest occurring in April. Plant samples were conducted weekly to estimate the numbers of aphid per plant. Based on these studies, planting date and temperature likely has a strong influence on seasonal abundance and damage caused by aphids. Green peach aphid was the least abundant aphid during the 5 year period, and <b>foxglove</b> <b>aphids</b> appear to be increasing in abundance over the past 3 years. All aphid species {{have the potential to}} economically contaminate lettuce, particularly in the November and December planting windows...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the seasonal occurrence of aphids and to evaluate efficacy of Carbofuran, Disulfoton and Ortran applied infurrow at the planting time in the field for the control of some aphids on soybean in 1976. <b>Foxglove</b> <b>aphids</b> (Aulacorthum solani) and soybean aphids (Aphis glycines) were dominant species in the soybean field and there were two peaks in the year. The occurrence patterns of aphids were different between visual counting on leaves and in yellow-pans.

40|$|Action thresholds, {{based on}} the {{percentage}} of plants infested, for the aphid pest complex found in head lettuce were evaluated in October, November and December plantings in 2005 and 2006 at the Yuma Agricultural Center. Action thresholds were also evaluated for their compatibility with newly developed reduced-risk and conventional insecticides. Although all five common aphid species were present in both years of the study, <b>foxglove</b> <b>aphids</b> provided most of the pest pressure. Compared with the SAC threshold treatment (sprayed-at colonization; essentially sprayed weekly until new aphid colonies were not found), action thresholds of 10 % and 30 % plants infested with 5 or more aphids resulted in fewer insecticide applications, while maintaining varying levels of head contamination at harvest. Despite variable pest pressure between years and planting dates, the threshold based on 10 % infested plants performed {{as well as the}} SAC but with half as many sprays and no significant head contamination. However, significant head contamination was experienced when the 10 % action threshold was used exclusively with reduced-risk insecticides...|$|R
40|$|In the {{cultivation}} of soybean plants in Hokkaido and in the Tohoku region of Japan, the most difficult problem at present is soybean dwarf virus disease (SDV). This disease was first found on the soybean variety 2 ̆ 7 Tsurunoko 2 ̆ 7 in southern areas of Hokkaido in about 1952. Since then researchers have been attempting to overcome it, and some aspects of this disease were clarified: for example, this disease was not transmitted by manual inoculation of sap or through seeds, but was transmitted by the grafting method or <b>foxglove</b> <b>aphid</b> in a persistent manner. Two strains of SDV were obtained from naturally infected soybean plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{parasitoid}} Aphidius gifuensis {{is able to}} parasitize {{both the}} green peach aphid Myzus persicae and the <b>foxglove</b> <b>aphid</b> Aulacorthum solani in sweet pepper. In a greenhouse experiment we showed that rates of parasitism on green peach aphids alone were equal to the commonly used Aphidius colemani, but lower than with Aphidius matricariae. Foxglove aphids were suppressed very effectively by A. gifuensis. In contrast, A. matricariae {{was not able to}} parasitize this aphid. When the two aphid species were offered simultaneously, A. gifuensis suppressed both aphid species, whereas the presence of foxglove aphids had a negative effect on the control of green peach aphids by A. matricariae. We conclude that A. gifuensis is a promising candidate for biological control of both foxglove aphids and green peach aphids in sweet pepper, especially when these aphids occur together...|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} control of the <b>foxglove</b> <b>aphid</b> (Aulacorthum solani) in {{greenhouse}} sweet pepper, several trials on three trophic levels have been conducted. Two different lines of Aphelinus abdominalis were compared on flight capacity, parasitation and predation. One line was significantly better in parasitation of A. solani (6. 3 vs 0. 2 mummies/female/day). This line performed also better at lower temperatures (15 - 18 º C.) in flight capacity. Predation was the same for both lines (2 aphids/female/day). The honeydew of A. solani was tested as a food source on Aphidius spp. The life span of Aphidius on this honeydew was 4 days which was equal to water and half of sucrose. On 100 ha. of commercially grown sweet pepper a banker plant system (wheat, Sitobion avena, A. abdominalis) was used. In general growers were able {{to reduce the number of}} chemical corrections from 7 to around 3. In sweet peppers grown under glass there is a natural oscillation of 4 - 5 weeks in flowering and fruit set. We observed large differences in aphid growth depending on this vegetative or fruiting phase. The practical considerations how to adjust the biological control still has to be investigated...|$|E
40|$|Small plot {{studies were}} {{conducted}} from 1999 - 2001 {{to examine the}} population abundance {{and control of the}} lettuce aphid on winter and spring head lettuce crops. In each year, Seven, 0. 25 acre planting of head lettuce were established beginning in Sep-Oct with final harvest occurring in April. Replicated plots within several planting were treated with an Admire treatment at planting, a side dress application of Platinum post-planting or allowed to remain untreated. Lettuce aphids were first detected in our experimental area in December in PD 3 in 2001, but in 2002 first occurred in lettuce almost 2 months later (Feb 21). Similarly, lettuce aphid abundance was much greater in 2001 than in 2002, probably a result of temperature difference. Temperature had an important influence upon lettuce aphid development based on our field observations. Population appeared to increase in early March when the average daily temperature was about 65 E F. We observed a sharp decline in population abundance in April where daytime highs exceeded 90 E F. Insecticide treatments also influenced seasonal abundance. Under heavy aphid pressure in 2001, lettuce treated with Admire in the early planting dates appeared to prevent lettuce aphids from significantly infesting lettuce heads at harvest. However, lettuce aphids in the last 3 planting dates were able to colonize plants and infest a larger proportion of heads at levels not considered commercially acceptable. Under lighter pressure in 2002, lettuce aphids did not significantly colonize Admire treated lettuce. Green peach aphid, potato <b>aphid</b> and <b>foxglove</b> <b>aphids</b> were also present in both years, but seldom reached economic levels, and where completely controlled in plots treated with soil, systemic insecticides...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{control in}} sweet pepper {{has been one}} of the success stories of the {{greenhouse}} industry for decades. This success is mainly based on inoculative releases of anthocorid predatory bugs and generalist phytoseiid predatory mites, which successfully control thrips, broad mites and whiteflies. One of the last obstacles for a completely pesticide-free cropping system are aphids. Sweet pepper in particular is often quickly damaged by aphids, mainly by the peach aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer), the <b>foxglove</b> <b>aphid</b> Aulacorthum solani (Kaltenbach) and the cotton aphid Aphis gossypii (Glover), because of their extremely fast development in this crop. Biological control of these pests in sweet pepper is difficult and expensive, as effective control requires repeated releases of natural enemies. So far, aphid control strategies are mainly based on frequent releases of specialized aphid parasitoids and the predatory midge Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Rondani). Additionally, growers release chrysopid, syrphid or coccinellid predators to suppress high aphid densities. However, none of these natural enemies is able to establish in a crop without aphids. Biological control of aphids might be greatly improved by generalist predators that are able to establish in a sweet pepper crop prior to aphid infestations, because this can result in rapid responses to new aphid infestations and prevent establishment of aphids...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of natural}} enemy {{diversity}} in biological pest control has been debated in many studies, and understanding how interactions amongst predators and parasitoids affect herbivore populations {{is crucial for}} pest management. In this study, we assessed the individual and combined use of two species of natural enemies, the parasitoid Aphidius ervi Haliday, and the predatory brown lacewing Micromus variegatus (Fabricius), on their shared prey, the <b>foxglove</b> <b>aphid,</b> Aulacorthum solani (Kaltenbach), on sweet pepper. We hypothesized {{that the presence of}} intraguild predation (IGP) and predator facilitation (through induced aphid dropping behaviour) might have both negative and positive effects on aphid control, respectively. Our greenhouse trial showed that overall, the greatest suppression of aphids occurred in the treatment with both the parasitoid and the lacewing. While the combination of lacewings and parasitoids significantly increased aphid control compared to the use of parasitoids alone, the effect was not significantly different to the treatment with only predators, although there was a clear trend of enhanced suppression. Thus, the combined effects of both species of natural enemies were between additive and non-additive, suggesting that the combination is neither positive nor negative for aphid control. High levels of IGP, as proven in the laboratory, were probably compensated for by the strong aphid suppression provided by the lacewings, whether or not supplemented with some level of predator facilitation. For aphid management over a longer time scale, it might still be useful to combine lacewings and parasitoids to ensure stable and resilient aphid control. <br/...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{objective in}} biology {{is to understand}} the evolutionary and ecological processes that lead to patterns of diversity. Specialized insect-host relationships have long been suspected of facilitating evolutionary diversification due to the intimate relationship parasites share with their hosts {{and the potential for}} disruptive selection when utilizing different host species resulting in genetic divergence. However, the vast majority of research investigating insect-host specialization has focused on herbivores, while the mechanisms of population and species divergence in insects that parasitize and kill other insects (parasitoids) have been largely ignored. Parasitoids have great potential for research in host-specialization and speciation due to their unique biological properties and the immens; diversity that is,characteristic of this ecologically important guild. 2 ̆ 7. The goal of my Ph. D. thesis was to contribute to the greater understanding of host specialization and speciation in parasitoid wasps, with a particular focus on the processes that drive adaptive diversification and the behavioural mechanisms that maintain genetic variation. These topics were addressed through a combination of experimental biology, fieldwork and theoretical modelling using a host-parasite system consisting of a single parasitoid (Aphidius ervi) and two host species (the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum and the <b>foxglove</b> <b>aphid,</b> Aulacorthum solani). Specifically, the physiological mechanism involved in overcoming host defences was investigated to determine if parasitoids adaptively evolve to overcome host defences and ifthis process is under directional selection. Host fidelity, host plant preference, mating preference, and host-instar selection were investigated to determine the importance of these behaviours in mediating gene flow between parasitoid populations utilizing different host species. In combination, these studies further contribute to our basic understanding ofthe mechanisms that lead to and maintain genetic diversity in insect parasitoids...|$|E
40|$|<b>Foxglove</b> <b>aphid,</b> Aulacorthum solani (Kaltenbach), has {{recently}} become a significant pest of greenhouse crops {{in the north}} eastern U. S., Canada, and the U. K. Given its previous status as an occasional pest, little was known about its biology or ecology. Using a North American population, development time and life table statistics of A. solani were investigated at 6 temperatures. Aulacorthum solani developed fastest (6. 9 ± 0. 29 d) and had the highest intrinsic rate of increase (rm = 0. 25) at 25 °C; limited development was seen at higher temperatures (rm = - 0. 24 at 30 °C). A study of 10 different greenhouse crops showed that these aphids generally distribute to bottom leaves of vegetative plants, but move upwards when plants are reproductive. Biological control of A. solani using the generalist aphid predator Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Rondani) was assessed {{in a series of}} greenhouse experiments. Here, the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), was also included because aphid pests can co-occur. Experiments showed that A. aphidimyza perceives aphid colonies located on new growth of plants (meristems or top leaves) to be of higher value as oviposition sites compared to other plant locations. Aulacorthum solani-infested plants, with aphids primarily present on lower leaves or flowers, received fewer eggs than M. persicae-infested plants. In trials using a single innundative release of the predator, this translated to more variable control of A. solani compared to M. persicae (12 - 80 % vs. 78 - 95 %, respectively; tested across several stages of plant growth). This is likely partially attributable to apparent competition, since control of A. solani was significantly improved in the absence of alternate prey. Entomopathogenic fungi were assessed as another biocontrol option against aphids, including the melon aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover. Novel isolates of fungi originally collected from aphid hosts were sought to potentially increase pathogenicity. However, no isolate tested, commercial or novel, resulted in acceptable mortality of 1 st instar aphid nymphs, with all LC 50 values > 700 conidia/mm 2 under ideal lab conditions. Control options for A. solani and multi-species aphid infestations are discussed in light of the results presented in this thesis...|$|E
