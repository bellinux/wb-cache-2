Therefore, this work probes the possibility of eliminating these drawbacks by using tensile drawing. The yarns are produced with different specifications from the same fibers. The results are encouraging, since contrary to predictions, staple yarns treated this way do perform properly. Tensile drawing especially improves rotor spun yarn quality in terms of structural/mechanical evenness and processability. Other features include increased packing density, reduced yarn diameter, enhanced mechanical rigidity, and even the potential for larger tenacity. The influence of processing variables on yarn properties is also revealed by examining {{the contribution of the}} number of yarn loops mounted on the feed roller and rewinding to drawing and the resulting products. The number of yarn loops wound on the feed roller is significant in terms of drawing tension. Optimum drawing can be obtained without rewinding in terms of better yarn properties and economics, though rewinding can effectively eliminate fiber breakage. Moreover, the truely critical factor in the drawing extent should be drawing tension rather than the so-called drawing ratio. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|A {{regular and}} {{precisely}} defined staple crimp {{is an important}} contributor to {{the appearance of the}} fleece (Henderson, 1968). It is also well recognised that young sheep have a fleece that is better than older sheep. In some instances the deterioration of the fleece starts at an early age and proceeds rapidly. This wool has been referred to as “doggy” wool. The main characteristic of “doggy” wool is a lowering of crimp frequency, through several stages according to severity, so that the wool has an irregular crimp, an unnatural lustre and a <b>harsh</b> <b>handle</b> (Ryder and Stephenson, 1968). The fault has been widely reported in the Australian Merino. In one survey of the Eastern States of Australia no flock was found without some form of abnormal crimping. The fault was more prevalent in order sheep (Chapman and Short, 1964 a). “Doggy” wool is classified as rough fleece in Australia. Rough fleece in the Australian clip has increased in recent years to ¾ per cent of the total wool clip, the price gained being appreciably less than that of wools with more crimp. True “Doggy” wool is thought to make up at least ⅔ of the total rough fleece, the remainder being steely (copper deficient) wool (Chapman, 1964). There is no doubt that some wools, affected only slightly by crimp abnormality, are present in normal wool grades but have been devalued by the slight crimp upset. An association was found between “doggy” wool production and the presence of capsules attached to an enlarged outer-root sheath of a varying proportion of follicles in the population (Chapman, Short and Hyland, 19860; Chapman and Short, 1965 b). The incidence of follicles with capsules was found to increase with age (Chapman, Short and Hyland, 1960) and was associated with the production of short, straight, coarse fibres by affected follicles (Chapman and Short, 1965 b). The presence of a number of these fibres in a staple of wool was found to upset the crimp form of the staple of wool was found to upset the crimp form of the staple (Aiken and Ryder, 1962; Chapman and Short, 1964 a). Burns and Clarkson (1950) had noted the presence of capsules attached to Romney wool follicles. These had also been noted in the New Zealand Romney by Henderson (1967). The present experiment was designed to establish whether or not these capsules were present in any great numbers in the Romney, and with the Australian experience in mind, to try and establish a relationship between their presence and deterioration of crimp with age. If sheep with capsulated follicles were present in any great number and crimp deterioration was significantly associated with the presence of aberrant follicles, there would be justification for further work in this field. A large number of sheep with this fault could cause quite a serious devaluation in the New Zealand Wool clip. Although only one flock was involved in the experiment reported, it is in the nature of a survey of the incidence of a possibly serious wool fault...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} awareness of environmental pollution and the extensive 	consideration of mankind health, {{there has been}} an increased demand for natural fibers 	in textile materials recently. As a typical natural fiber, ramie is an increasingly popular 	because of its excellent properties including a high tensile strength, excellent thermal 	conductivity, coolness, ventilation function, moisture absorption, and antibacterial 	function. However, ramie fiber and ramie fabric have some disadvantages such as poor 	elasticity, low wrinkle recovery, low resilience, itchiness, <b>harsh</b> <b>handle,</b> which decreases 	the competitiveness of ramie fabric in the high-grade garment-fabric market. It is 	necessary to use the advanced technologies in the dyeing and finishing for enhancing 	the competitiveness of ramie fabric. This study is aimed to study the natural dyeing and 	functional finishing of ramie fabric. At present, ramie fabrics are mostly dyed with synthetic colorants which can give rise 	to serious environmental pollution and potential harm to mankind health. Thus the 	natural and healthy features of ramie fabric are greatly weakened. In this study, ramie 	fabrics were dyed with the several natural extracts. But heavy metal ions, which lead to 	environmental pollution, are usually used as mordant in natural dyeing. In this study, the 	eco-friendly rare earth was used as mordant in natural dyeing of ramie fabrics. The 	influences of dyeing conditions were studied. The ramie fabrics dyed using rare earth as 	mordant exhibited higher color shade stability against pH variation. Using rare earth as 	mordant in natural dyeing apparently enhanced the color fastness to washing, rubbing 	and light of the ramie fabrics. As compared with Fe 2 + and Cr 6 +, rare earth was more 	efficient, resulting in decrease of mordant concentration in natural dyeing. Thus rare 	earth was effective mordant in the natural dyeing of ramie fabrics. One of the shortcomings of ramie fabric is its lower wrinkle recovery. The typical 	wrinkle resistant finishing via cross-linking usually decreases strength of cellulose 	fabrics. In this study, ramie fabrics were pretreated with liquid ammonia (NH 3) prior to 	wrinkle resistant finishing. Meanwhile, a kind of thermally reactive polyurethane (PU) 	emulsion was used as strength protector. The liquid NH 3 pretreatment was proved todecrease crystallinity of ramie fiber and bring about apparent swelling effect. As a result, 	the accessibility of the ramie fabrics treated by liquid NH 3 was elevated. The liquid NH 3 	pretreatment prior to resin finishing gave rise to better wrinkle resistant effect and less 	strength loss. The thermally reactive PU emulsion was proved to decrease strength loss 	of ramie fabric without influencing wrinkle resistant effect. Using liquid NH 3 	pretreatment and employing reactive PU as protector in the wrinkle resistant finishing 	of ramie fabric can raise strength retention up to 80 %. After 10 laundry cycles, the flat 	appearance and the crease retention of these ramie fabrics were over grade 3. 0. Developing electromagnetic shielding textiles has drawn increasing attention recently 	since electromagnetic pollution is harmful to mankind health. In this study, super critical 	carbon dioxide (scCO 2) fluid technology was used to develop electromagnetic shielding 	ramie fabric. The scCO 2 treatment could remove the impurities of the ramie fibers 	prominently. The scCO 2 fluid could result in the swelling of ramie fiber and thus 	increase the absorbency of ramie fiber to additives. Using scCO 2 fluid, the Palladium 	(II) -hexafluoroacetylacetonate could be impregnated into the ramie fiber under 	appropriate conditions. After thermal decomposition at high temperature, the Palladium 	film formed on ramie fibers. The ramie fabrics bearing Palladium catalyst were plated 	with a cooper film via electroless cooper plating. The cooper coated ramie fabrics 	exhibited good shielding effect. This study presented a new way for developing 	electromagnetic shielding fabric. Nanoparticles have been extensively used for the functional finishing of textiles. But 	the nano finishing of ramie fabrics has less been studied. In this study, the 	multifunctional ramie fabrics coated by TiO 2 nanoparticle were developed. The optimal 	dispersion conditions of TiO 2 nanoparticles in aqueous suspension were studied in 	details. A kind of hydrophilic silica aerogel product was proved to be suitable for 	serving as dispersant for dispersion of TiO 2. Using the TiO 2 suspension prepared in 	optimal conditions, ramie fabrics were coated with TiO 2 via a dip-pad-dry process. In 	order to enhance the finishing durability the ramie fabric were pretreated by citric acid 	prior to nano finishing. The ramie fabric finished with working bath containing 0. 8 g/L 	TiO 2 was proved exhibited excellent UV protection and antibacterial property, and high capability for decomposing formaldehyde. Treating fabric with citric acid before coating 	could improve the washing durability of the resultant TiO 2 loaded ramie fabrics. This study explored several ways for developing healthy and highly functional ramie 	fabrics with high added value. The resultant ramie fabrics exhibited high quality. The 	newly developed dyeing and finishing processes are supposed to be helpful for raising 	the competitiveness of ramie and expanding its application...|$|E

H 577 P ITC 2016 Huangxxxii, 259 pages :color illustrationsWool apparel {{and other}} textile {{products}} are of high value and {{popularity in the}} market {{all the time because}} of their aesthetic quality and comfort. With the increasing demand of light, thin and comfortable knitted fabrics, it is desirable to have wool yarns in medium to high counts with better yarn evenness, less hairiness, soft handle and reasonable tenacity, etc. By literature review, ring spinning continues to predominate in worsted yarn manufacturing industry because of its high quality of yarns and good flexibility in materials and yarn count. Many modifications have been conducted to enhance the control of fibers in spinning triangle and reduce yarn hairs, but nearly have no improvement on yarn soft handle and evenness. However,over ten years ago, a modified technology on the ring frame was developed by employing a false twisting device and a strand separator, which was named as Nu-torqueTM or low-torque or low-twist spinning. Since then, the technology has evolved in five versions. The low-twist cotton yarns exceed other types of modified ring spun yarns with respect to softer handle, lower residual torque, and outweigh the conventional ring yarns in aspects of higher tenacity, lower hairiness, etc. Previous versions of low-twist worsted yarn technology have produced low-twist worsted yarns in median and coarse count, however, some problems were found such as worse yarn optical evenness, more neps and tight wrapper fibers, as well as lower yarn tenacity, among which, the wrapper fibers give rise to obvious "bar effect" on the dyed knitted wool fabrics. Hence, this thesis is aimed at investigating these problems and exploring possible solutions from both theoretical and practical points of views. The surface structure of 24 Nm low-twist worsted yarns are examined under Microscope Lecia M 165 in details and classified into five types including three kinds of wrapping structures and two kinds of unwrapped structures. In particular, the tightly wrapping structures take up almost 60 % on the low-twist yarns. These tightly wrapping structures not only bring about quite compact yarn structures resulting in <b>harsh</b> <b>handle</b> of yarns and fabrics,but also deteriorate yarn optical evenness resulted from obviously smaller diameters than conventional yarn structures and higher variations. Using high speed camera system, the formation of wrapper fibers on the low-twist yarn surface has been investigated. It is found that the abrasion between yarns or the protruding fiber ends and the upper false-twister or the lower false-twister, the fiber security of yarns in A zone, as well as the false-twisting effects exerted by the two false-twisters, have effects on the wrapper fiber formation; more importantly, the wrapper fibers have roots in the long protruding fiber ends in A zone on the low-twist spinning system, namely, the hairiness of 3 mm and longer of the yarn segment between the spinning triangle and the false-twister. Besides, the bulked yarn segment resulted from excessive twists in A zone is reckoned as the reason for the formation of the curved yarns with tight wrapper fibers. Hypothesizing that the structure of yarn segment in A zone on the low-twist spinning system {{is similar to that of}} ring-spun yarns of a high twist without buckling, a hairiness model of such ring yarns is beneficial to understand the origin of hairiness and wrapper fibers as well as the formation of neps. The number of all fiber ends in the out-most layer of ring-spun yarn cross-section, which are already or have potentials to become hairs, is first defined as maximum hairiness in unit length of yarn. Based on Brown and Ly's work on the number of fiber ends in twist-less fiber assembly, a statistical model of the maximum hairiness of ring yarns has been established by considering yarn twist geometry and the contributing surface layer for hairs. In particular, fiber length, fiber cross-section and the number of fibers have been revised with the consideration of yarn twist. Moreover, Hairiness contribution factor (h 0) is proposed for model development as the ratio of the number of fiber ends having potentials for hairiness and the total number of fiber ends in yarn cross-section. From the developed model, it can be seen that the maximum hairiness of ring yarns, or the number of long protruding fiber ends in A zone of the low-twist spinning system, relates to fiber length distribution, fiber diameter, yarn count, yarn twist,measured hair length etc. Moreover, the present model provides the length of the predicted maximum hairiness, whereas previous related models fail to do so. The verification by experiments demonstrates that the predicted values of 1 mm and longer are in the same order of magnitude as the measured values, which are more accurate than the predicted values from other related models. Whereas, the predicted maximum hairiness of 3 mm and longer, that is, the long protruding fiber ends, is almost 1 ~ 2 order of magnitude higher than the measured S 3 values. Alternatively, there are some other ways to further reduce the number of long protruding fiber ends in A zone, like combining Siro-spinning or Solo-spinning with low-twist spinning, because it is generally believed that surface fiber trapping between the two substrands in Siro-spinning triangle or among several substrands in Solo-spinning triangle contributes to the significant decrease of yarn hairiness. Accordingly, the maximum hairiness model of ring yarns is revised for Siro-spun yarns and Solo-spun yarns with respect to fiber trapping and yarn geometry, respectively. Also, experiments have been carried out to verify the developed hairiness models. As aforementioned before, the fiber security of the yarn segment in A zone also influence the wrapper fiber formation and the resultant yarn surface; and the degree of fiber ends being tucked into yarn bodies directly determines the number of protruding hair of yarns. Whereas, the existing related parameters only describe fiber ends already protruding out of yarns. Similar to the theoretical limit of yarn evenness CVlim, the real yarn hairiness can approach but is always lower than the maximum hairiness of ring yarns. A Relative Hairiness Index (RHI) is accordingly proposed, which has two forms:the theoretical one and the actual one. The theoretical RHI is the ratio of maximum hairiness of certain type of yarn to the maximum hairiness of ring yarns, which can theoretically reveal the effectiveness of different spinning methods in tucking fiber ends into yarn bodies; and the so-called actual RHI is the ratio of the measured yarn hairiness and the maximum hairiness of ring yarns, which can actually demonstrate the degree of fiber ends potential for hairiness being tucked into yarns resulted from various spinning system or their spinning parameters. Both the theoretical RHI and the actual RHI demonstrate that Siro-spinning can most effectively tuck fiber ends into yarn bodies, therefore Siro-spun feeding will give rise to the least long protruding fiber ends. Additionally, winding is employed to mimic the abrasion that yarn will experience, and it is found that the hairiness of ring yarns obviously increases with the increasing winding times and reaches a plateau after the fourth winding, therefore the number of hairs of yarns after four-time winding, is termed as stable hairiness. By analyzing the increment rate of the actual RHI of various yarns in the states of cop, cone and stable, which are the yarns experience zero-time, one-time and four-time winding, respectively, Siro-pun yarns also present the best fiber security. Hence, Siro-spun feeding with a normal roving gap of 14 mm is combined with the lately 5 th version of low-twist spinning system for further reducing the wrapper fibers and improving the surface of low-twist yarns. However, aiming at yarn evenness and tenacity, as well as proper twists in A zone to avoid bulking as described before, the spinning parameters of 36 Nm low-twist yarns (36 LT) is first systematically optimized by means of the combination of Fractional Factorial Methodology and Response Surface Methodology, respectively. With a twist multiplier reduced by around 15 %, the optimized 36 LT yarns show comparable tenacity and similar hairiness, but still a bit worse evenness and more neps than the conventional yarns. Actually, the number of neps (+ 140 %) has been reduced about one order of magnitude on the present low-twist yarns by comparing with that of yarns produced on the previous versions of low-twist spinning system. The blackboard evenness of the optimized 36 LT yarns exhibits half grade lower than the conventional yarns with a twist multiplier higher by about 15 %, but half grade higher than the counterparts with the same level of twist multiplier, respectively. Then, the spinning parameters of 36 Nm low-twist yarns with double-roving feeding (36 LT+Siro) are also optimized by using Response Surface Methodology. The tightly wrapped structures on the optimized 36 LT yarns only account for 8. 9 %, whereas the ones on the optimized 36 LT+Siro yarns even reduce to 5. 8 %. Moreover, nearly no tightly wrapped structures with a curved yarn body are found on the two optimized yarn surfaces. Therefore, the optimized spinning parameters of low-twist spinning system, as well as the incorporation of Siro-spinning not only facilitate the reduction of wrapper fibers on the resultant yarns, but also provide suitable twists in A zone to avoid producing buckling and curved yarn segments. Nevertheless, the optimized 36 LT yarn has an obviously higher actual RHI than the conventional ring yarns, and it presents similar increment rate when enduring abrasion to that of its counterpart, which indicates that the optimized 36 LT yarns possess low fiber tucking and security, in other words, the fiber deformation resulted from false-twisting effect fails to be held in yarns. But the actual RHI of the optimized 36 LT+Siro yarn and its increment rate by abrasion are markedly lower than the ones of the conventional yarn, particularly, its increment rate is even similar to that of Solo-spun yarns. It is demonstrated that the fiber tucking and security of low-twist yarns can also be improved by integrating Siro-spinning system. Finally, using the Kawabata Evaluation System of Fabric (KES-F), the knitted fabrics made of the optimized 36 LT yarns are examined in terms of fabric surface property, tensile and shear, as well as bending and compression. There are no statistically significant differences in surface property,tensile, shear, bending, compression and bursting strength between the low-twist fabrics and the conventional fabrics made of the worsted yarns with a higher twist multiplier by around 15 % (at a significant level of 0. 05). However, the low-twist fabric possesses better pilling performance and air permeability, but lower thermal conductivity than its counterpart. Besides, nearly no "bar effect" is found on the resultant fabrics made of the optimized 36 LT yarns. Institute of Textiles and ClothingPh.

These rather unique features make Lys-N a good candidate for a variety of applications, such as membrane proteomics and possibly H/D exchange mass spectrometry.

500|$|Kronans {{displacement}} – the ship's weight {{calculated by}} how much water it displaced while floating – is not known precisely, {{since there are no}} exact records of the dimensions. By using contemporary documents describing the approximate measurements, it has been estimated at around 2,300tonnes. By its displacement in relation to the number and weight of guns, Kronan was over-gunned, though this was not uncommon for the era. European shipwrights had not been building three-deckers on a large scale before the 1650s; by the 1660s, designs were still quite experimental. Contemporary records show that English and French three-deckers tended to be rather unstable because they were built high, narrow and with too much artillery. Some English ships had to be reinforced with a [...] "girdle" [...] of built-up planking at the waterline to perform satisfactorily. In rough seas these ships could be forced to close the lowest row of gunports, depriving them of their heaviest and most effective guns. In these situations they were effectively just over-priced two-deckers. Kronans construction was not inherently flawed; the ship <b>handled</b> <b>harsh</b> weather conditions in 1675 and again only a week before capsizing, but she could be dangerous if handled poorly. Later, during the 18th century, ships with the same weight of guns had more tonnage to support their guns, usually weighing 3,000–5,000tonnes, which made them more stable. When Kronan was built, she was the third or fourth largest ship in the world, but as the trend moved towards ever greater ships, she was surpassed by other large warships. At the time Kronan sank, she was down to seventh place.|$|R
40|$|Multi-effect {{distillation}} (MED) {{systems are}} proven and energy efficient thermally-driven desalination systems for <b>handling</b> <b>harsh</b> seawater feed in the Gulf region. The high cycle efficiency is markedly achieved by latent energy re-use with minimal stage temperature-difference across the condensing steam and the evaporating saline seawater in each stage. The efficacies of MED system are (i) its low stage-temperature-difference between top brine temperature (TBT) and final condensing temperature, (ii) its robustness to varying salinity {{and ability to}} handle harmful algae Blooming (HABs) and (iii) its compact foot-print per unit water output. The practical TBT of MED systems, hitherto, is around 65 C for controllable scaling and fouling with the ambient-limited final condenser temperature, usually from 30 to 45 C. The adsorption (ADC) cycles utilize low-temperature heat sources (typically below 90 C) to produce useful cooling power and potable water. Hybridizing MED with AD cycles, they synergistically improve the water production rates at the same energy input whilst the AD cycle {{is driven by the}} recovered waste heat. We present a practical AD + MED combination that can be retrofitted to existing MEDs: The cooling energy of AD cycle through the water vapor uptake by the adsorbent is recycled internally, providing lower temperature condensing environment in the effects whilst the final condensing temperature of MED is as low as 5 - 10 C, which is below ambient. The increase in the temperature difference between TBT and final condensing temperature accommodates additional MED stages. A detailed numerical model is presented to capture the transient behaviors of heat and mass interactions in the combined AD + MED cycles and the results are presented in terms of key variables. It is observed that the water production rates of the combined cycle increase to give a GOR of 8. 8 from an initial value of 5. 9. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} count people from video is a {{challenging}} problem. The scientific challenge {{arises from the}} fact that although the task is pretty well defined, the imaging scenario is not well constrained. The background scene is uncontrolled. Lighting is complex and varying. And, image resolution, both in terms of spatial and temporal is usually poor, especially in pre-stored surveillance videos. Passive counting of people from video has many practical applications such as in monitoring the number of people sitting in front of a TV set, counting people in an elevator, counting people passing through a security door, and counting people in a mall. This has led to some research in automated counting of people. The context of most of the work in people counting is in counting pedestrians in outdoor settings or moving subjects in indoor settings. There is little work done in counting of people who are not moving around and very little work done in people counting that can <b>handle</b> <b>harsh</b> variations in illumination conditions. In this thesis, we explore a design that handles such issues at pixel level using photometry based normalization and at feature level by exploiting spatiotemporal coherence that is present in the change seen in the video. We have worked on home and laboratory dataset. The home dataset has subjects watching television and the laboratory dataset has subjects working. The design of the people counter is based on video data that is temporally sparsely sampled at 15 seconds of time difference between consecutive frames. Specific computer vision methods used involves image intensity normalization, frame to frame differencing, motion accumulation using autoregressive model and grouping in spatio-temporal volume. The experimental results show: The algorithm is less susceptible to lighting changes. Given an empty scene with just lighting change it usually produces a count of zero. It can count in varying illumination conditions. It can count people even if they are partially visible. Counts are generated for any moving objects in the scene. It does not yet try to distinguish between humans and non-humans. Counting errors are concentrated around frames with large motion events, such as a person moving out from a scene...|$|R
30|$|This process {{involves}} {{addition of}} aqueous organic solvents such as ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, acetone etc. to the biomass under specific condition of temperature and pressure (Alriols et al. 2009; Ichwan and Son 2011). Commonly, this process {{takes place in}} the presence of an acid, base or salt catalyst (Bajpai 2016). Temperature in organosolv pretreatment depends on the type of biomass and catalyst involved and may reach up to 200  °C. This process is mainly used for the extraction of lignin which is a value-added product. Apart from lignin, cellulose fraction and hemicellulose syrup of C 5 and C 6 sugars are also produced during the course of organosolv pretreatment. Removal of lignin from the biomass exposes the cellulose fibers for enzymatic hydrolysis leading to higher conversion of biomass (Agbor et al. 2011). The physical characteristics of pretreated biomass such as fiber length, degree of cellulose polymerization, crystallinity etc. depends upon variable factors such as temperature, reaction time, solvent concentration and catalyst used. High temperatures, high acid concentrations, and long reaction time have {{led to the formation of}} inhibitors of fermentation. Park et al. (2010 a, b) studied the effect of different catalysts (H 2 SO 4, NaOH, and MgSO 4) on pine and found H 2 SO 4 as the most effective catalyst in terms of ethanol yield. However, in terms of digestibility, NaOH was found to be effective when its concentration was increased by 2 %. H 2 SO 4 has high reactivity therefore has proven to be a very strong catalyst but at the same time it is toxic, corrosive and is inhibitory in nature. The main drawback of this process is the high cost of the solvents, though this drawback can be minimized by recovering and recycling solvents through evaporation and condensation. Removal of solvents is very important because the solvent may cause negative effect on growth of microorganisms, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation (Agbor et al. 2011). Also, organosolv is less preferred due to high risk involved in <b>handling</b> <b>harsh</b> organic solvents that are highly flammable. In absence of proper safety measures, it can cause severe damage leading to large fire explosions. The Battelle is a type of organosolv method that treats the biomass with mixture of phenol, HCl, and water at temperature 100  °C and pressure 1  atm (Villaverde et al. 2010). Acid is responsible for the depolymerization of lignin as well as it hydrolyses the hemicellulose portion of the biomass. Lignin is dissolved in the phenol while the sugars (monosaccharides) are found in the aqueous phase upon cooling. Likewise formasolv is a type of organosolv involving formic acid, water, and HCl. Lignin is soluble in formic acid and the pretreatment process can be carried out at low temperature and pressure (Zhao and Liu 2012). Unlike formasolv, ethanosolv (involving ethanol) is operated at high temperature and pressure and recovers value-added products namely cellulose, hemicellulose, and pure lignin. Further purification may be carried out through ionic liquids which are discussed later in this review (Prado et al. 2012). The less toxic nature of ethanol as compared to methanol and it being the final product makes it more popular as compared to other solvents (Kim et al. 2011 a, b). However, presence of ethanol inhibits the performance of hydrolytic enzymes, therefore lower ethanol: water is used for hydrolysis of hemicellulose and enzymatic degradation of pretreated biomass (Huijgen et al. 2008). Also, nearly complete recovery of ethanol and water is a major advantage which reduces the operation cost (Koo et al. 2012; Alriols et al. 2010). Mesa et al. (2011) applied ethanosolv on sugarcane bagasse for production of reducing sugars. 29.1 % reducing sugars were produced by 30 % ethanol for 60  min at 195  °C. Similarly, horticultural waste was pretreated by a modified method using ethanol under mild conditions for bioethanol production. Pretreatment resulted in hydrolysate containing 15.4 % reducing sugar after 72  h, which after fermentation produced 1.169 % ethanol in 8  h using Saccharomyces cerevicae (Geng et al. 2012). Hideno et al. (2013) reported utilization of alcohol-based organosolv treatment in combination with ball milling for pretreatment of Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa). They observed that combination of alcohol-based organosolv treatment in mild conditions and short time ball milling had a synergistic effect on the enzymatic digestibility. Ichwan and Son (2011) studied the effect of various solvents such as ethanol–water, ethylene glycol–water, and acetic acid–water mixture to extract cellulose from oil palm pulp. The yield of organosolv pulping with ethylene glycol–water, ethanol–water, and acetic acid–water mixture was 50.1, 48.1, and 41.7 %, respectively. Panagiotopoulos et al. (2012) treated poplar wood chips with steam followed by organosolv treatment for separating hemicellulose, lignin, and cellulose components. Lignin extraction was found to increase to 66 %, while 98 % of the cellulose was recovered by two stage pretreatment process and 88 % of cellulose was hydrolyzed to glucose after 72  h.|$|R
