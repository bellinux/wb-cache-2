5|$|A new <b>figure,</b> <b>a</b> wizard, {{had been}} added {{to the left of the}} sleighs and the lion guardians at the entry of the temple, which had {{received}} a noticeably Chinese character. The colours are forceful and there are considerable amounts of gold, something that Larsson intended as a disclaimer of the common notion that pre-history was gray.|$|E
5|$|After his death, Edwin {{came to be}} venerated as a saint by some, {{although}} his cult was eventually overshadowed by the ultimately more successful cult of Oswald, {{who was killed in}} 642. They met their deaths in battle against similar foes, the pagan Mercians and the British, thus allowing both of them to be perceived as martyrs; however, Bede's treatment of Oswald clearly demonstrates that he regarded him as an unambiguously saintly <b>figure,</b> <b>a</b> status that he did not accord to Edwin.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, {{service members}} {{returned}} to the area, spurring an enormous population explosion which dwarfed the 1920s boom. The 1960 Census counted 83,648 people in the city, about 230% of the 1950 <b>figure.</b> <b>A</b> 1967 report estimated {{that the city was}} approximately 85% developed, and the 1970 population figure was 139,590.|$|E

5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the <b>figure,</b> <b>a</b> molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E
5|$|Each action figure will be {{made with}} a 3-D web tag, called an i-TAG, that {{consumers}} can scan using a web cam, revealing unique on-screen content that is special to each specific action <b>figure.</b> <b>A</b> series of toys representing six different characters from the film were also distributed globally in McDonald's Happy Meals.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Kotaku after {{the announcement of the}} remaster, Schafer stated that he has long considered the aspect of a Grim Fandango sequel to further expand on the setting that was created for the game. He felt the story would be a difficult component, as either they would have to <b>figure</b> <b>a</b> means to bring Manny back from his final reward, or otherwise build the story around a new character. However, one option he has considered to alleviate the issue is by creating an adventure game using an open-world mechanic similar to the Grand Theft Auto series.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> vertex <b>figure</b> for <b>an</b> n-polytope is an (n−1)-polytope. For example, <b>a</b> vertex <b>figure</b> for <b>a</b> {{polyhedron}} is <b>a</b> polygon <b>figure,</b> and the vertex <b>figure</b> for <b>a</b> 4-polytope is a polyhedron.|$|R
50|$|Related to the vertex <b>figure,</b> <b>an</b> edge <b>figure</b> is the vertex <b>figure</b> of <b>a</b> vertex <b>figure.</b> Edge {{figures are}} useful for expressing {{relations}} between the elements within regular and uniform polytopes.|$|R
2500|$|Pneumatic {{actuators}} can be {{used for}} small animatronics but are not powerful enough for large designs and must be supplemented with hydraulics. [...] To create more realistic movement in large <b>figures,</b> <b>an</b> analog system is generally used to give the <b>figures</b> <b>a</b> full range of fluid motion rather than simple two position movements.|$|R
5|$|Contrasting Bogaert's 1% <b>figure,</b> <b>a</b> {{study by}} Aicken et al., {{published}} in 2013, suggests that, based on Natsal-2 data from 2000-2001, {{the prevalence of}} asexuality in Britain is only 0.4% for people {{between the ages of}} 16-44. This percentage indicates a decrease from the 0.9% figure determined from the Natsal-1 data collected on the same age-range a decade earlier. A 2015 analysis by Bogaert also found a similar decline between the Natsal-1 and Natsal-2 data. Aicken, Mercer, and Cassell found some evidence of ethnic differences among respondents who had not experienced sexual attraction; both men and women of Indian and Pakistani origin had a higher likelihood of reporting a lack of sexual attraction. Muslims {{were also more likely to}} report this lack of attraction than respondents from Christian religions.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{divided the}} Empire again in 293AD, {{appointing}} two Caesars (junior emperors) to rule over further subdivisions of East and West. Each would be subordinate {{to their respective}} Augustus (senior emperor) but would act with supreme authority in his assigned lands. This system would later be called the Tetrarchy. Diocletian's first appointee {{for the office of}} Caesar was Constantius; his second was Galerius, a native of Felix Romuliana. According to Lactantius, Galerius was a brutal, animalistic man. Although he shared the paganism of Rome's aristocracy, he seemed to them an alien <b>figure,</b> <b>a</b> semi-barbarian. On 1 March, Constantius was promoted to the office of Caesar, and dispatched to Gaul to fight the rebels Carausius and Allectus. In spite of meritocratic overtones, the Tetrarchy retained vestiges of hereditary privilege, and Constantine became the prime candidate for future appointment as Caesar as soon as his father took the position. Constantine went to the court of Diocletian, where he lived as his father's heir presumptive.|$|E
5|$|Gauguin {{made three}} casts in 1894, each in {{partially}} glazed stoneware. Several other copies exist in plaster or bronze. His {{sale of the}} casts were not successful, and at a low financial and personal ebb he asked that {{for one of the}} reproductions to act as a marker for his grave. A cast was not placed there until 1973. There are only three other surviving comments of his on the figure: on an 1895 presentation mount of two impressions of a woodcut of the Oviri figure he made to Stéphane Mallarmé where he called the <b>figure</b> <b>a</b> strange and cruel enigma; in an 1897 letter to Ambroise Vollard where he referred to it as La Tueuse ("The Murderess"); and in a c. 1899 drawing where he appends an inscription referencing Honoré de Balzac's novel Séraphîta. Oviri was exhibited at the 1906 Salon d'Automne (no.57) where it influenced Pablo Picasso, who based one of the figures in Les Demoiselles d'Avignon on it.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{classification}} of the geomantic figures involves their quality, which is either stable or mobile. The quality of <b>a</b> <b>figure</b> represents its duration of effect or motion, such that <b>a</b> <b>figure</b> with <b>a</b> stable quality will represent a long-term situation {{or that a}} certain object remains where it was left, while <b>a</b> mobile <b>figure</b> represents <b>a</b> transient effect upon the real world. In simple [...] "yes or no" [...] style divinations, stable <b>figures</b> indicate <b>a</b> positive answer, while mobile <b>figures</b> indicate <b>a</b> negative one.|$|R

[...] Each <b>figure</b> has <b>a</b> certain [...] "tix," [...] or speed, that it can move; on each turn, the player moves his or her Attacktix by moving the base along a surface and hearing a clicking sound. Afterwards, the player can then attack with up to two figures, either by swinging <b>a</b> <b>figure</b> with <b>a</b> melee weapon or shooting <b>a</b> <b>figure</b> with <b>a</b> projectile. If <b>a</b> <b>figure</b> is knocked over, it is [...] "defeated" [...] and cannot return to battle.|$|R
5|$|Historian Timothy Bolton has {{recently}} {{argued that the}} similarities between these genealogies is evidence of a shared family tradition between the descendants of Siward and Thorgil Sprakling. Bolton hypothesized that Siward's alleged father Bjorn was probably a historical <b>figure,</b> <b>a</b> brother of Thorgil Sprakling. Siward would then have been first cousin to Earl Ulf, the earl of Denmark who married Cnut's sister Estrith and founded the dynasty of Danish monarchs that eventually succeeded Cnut's. Bolton argued that the Sprakling family had only recently risen to prominence in Scandinavia, and so Siward's career in England was another indication of that family's success in Scandinavian politics.|$|E
5|$|Holst's {{works were}} played {{frequently}} {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of The Planets in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known <b>figure.</b> <b>A</b> shy man, he did not welcome this fame, and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was a significant influence on a number of younger English composers, including Edmund Rubbra, Michael Tippett and Benjamin Britten. Apart from The Planets and a handful of other works, his music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of officially {{recognized}} diagnostic criteria, and beyond the ambit of the discourse on a broader set of criteria discussed above, the term attachment disorder has been increasingly used by some clinicians {{to refer to a}} broader set of children whose behavior may be affected by lack of a primary attachment <b>figure,</b> <b>a</b> seriously unhealthy attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted attachment relationship. Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'. This form of therapy, including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered to be part of mainstream psychology or, despite its name, to be based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible. It has been described as potentially abusive and a pseudoscientific intervention, that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children.|$|E

50|$|When {{asked to}} arrange, draw, or copy a simple model of one- to {{three-dimensional}} <b>figures,</b> <b>a</b> patient consistently neglects important {{details on the}} model’s left side.

5|$|While the Doctor works, Amy {{sees the}} mysterious figure again, and excuses {{herself to the}} restroom. There, the <b>figure,</b> <b>a</b> member of a species known as the Silence, waits for her and kills an {{innocent}} woman despite Amy's pleas. Realising the alien is wiping her memory of their encounters, Amy takes {{a picture of the}} alien. When she leaves the restroom, however, she yet again forgets the encounter. By then the Doctor has found the girl's location, a building near Cape Canaveral, Florida, at the intersection to streets named Jefferson, Adams, and Hamilton. The Doctor and his companions leave in the TARDIS, followed closely by a curious Delaware.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{struck his}} contemporaries as a sad <b>figure,</b> <b>a</b> loner with few friends in cricket. He rarely {{encouraged}} young players or gave out praise. He liked {{to mix with}} middle-class people, spending money he did not really have, leading to accusations of snobbery. Team-mates regarded him as moody, private and uncommunicative. Often silent {{in the company of}} others, he could be arrogant and unfriendly. Charlie Barnett and Charles Dacre, two of his Gloucestershire team-mates, came almost to hate him. Dacre often played in a reckless way of which Hammond disapproved; Hammond, in turn, may have been jealous of him. Hammond once tried hard to injure Dacre by bowling fast at him while he was wicketkeeper. Barnett began as a close friend but fell out over Hammond's treatment of his first wife and later his refusal to play in Barnett's benefit match. Other players who were involved in disputes with Hammond included Denis Compton, whose cavalier approach Hammond disliked, and Learie Constantine, who believed Hammond insulted him in the West Indies in 1925, although the two later made peace. Hammond's ultimate rivalry was with Bradman, who overshadowed him throughout his career, and with whom he developed an increasing obsession. It was not enough for Hammond to be the second-best batsman in the world, and he disliked the constant comparisons made between them in Bradman's favour. He felt not only that he had to do well, but also that he had to score more than Bradman.|$|E
