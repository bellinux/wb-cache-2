5|$|Bosworth's {{first film}} role came after an open casting call <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>for</b> the {{supporting}} part of Judith in the 1998 film, The Horse Whisperer.

In 2000, she starred in the television series drama Young Americans, in which she played Bella Banks. The series, however, was canceled. That same year, she had a small part in the film Remember the Titans. In 2001, Bosworth moved to Los Angeles in hopes of obtaining easier access to auditions and better film parts.|$|E

5|$|In May 1909 Wodehouse {{made his}} second visit to New York, where he sold two short stories to Cosmopolitan and Collier's {{for a total}} of $500, a much higher fee than he had {{commanded}} previously.

5|$|Match Point is a 2005 British-Luxembourgish {{psychological}} thriller film {{written and}} directed by Woody Allen and starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, Emily Mortimer, Matthew Goode, Brian Cox, and Penelope Wilton. In the film, Rhys Meyers's character marries into a wealthy family, but his social position is threatened by his affair with his brother-in-law's girlfriend, played by Johansson. The film treats themes of morality, greed, and the roles of lust, money, and luck in life, leading many to compare it to Allen's earlier film Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989). It was produced and filmed in London after Allen had difficulty finding financial support for the film in New York. The agreement obliged him to make it there using a cast and crew mostly from the United Kingdom. Allen quickly re-wrote the script, which was originally set <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>for</b> a British setting.|$|E

Despite the injury, the Panthers signed him to a five-year, $47.5million {{contract}} (with an option for a sixth year at $10.5million), the most lucrative in team history. Another injury ended Bure's season after just 11 games with Florida, though he scored 13 goals and three assists in that time.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea of a}} new Waldorf-Astoria {{hotel was}} based on the concept {{that there should be a}} large opulent hotel <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>for</b> {{distinguished}} visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to get in the summer of 1929 as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether this was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, who had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate.|$|E
