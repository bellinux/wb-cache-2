30|$|Whether <b>general</b> <b>programmes</b> or migrant-specific {{ones are}} more {{effective}} for the integration of immigrants into the labour market {{is a question of}} major policy interest. One might expect migrant-specific programmes to be more successful since they were designed for the needs of immigrants, whereas <b>general</b> <b>programmes</b> address the needs of average participants, including mostly natives. However, the fact that, in practice, both programmes coexist in all European countries might be taken to suggest that neither of them is superior or that policymakers are not aware of which programmes work and which ones do not. 2 Empirical studies have not established an answer to this question either. We attempt to address it by means of our meta-analysis.|$|E
40|$|Article {{presents}} {{the differences between}} certain morphological and motor variables of the high-school girls according {{to the type of}} educational programme they attend: general (gymnasium), technical/professional or vocational. Research included 17. 424 girls, out of them 8. 910 attended <b>general</b> <b>programmes,</b> 6. 226 technical or professional courses and 2. 288 were included in vocational programmes. Data were collected {{within the framework of the}} Sport-educational chart data collection. Variance analysis and t-test were used to calculate the differences in the types of programmes for 11 variables, whereas discriminatory analysis was used to find variables, which most significantly differentiate the groups of 16 -, 17 - and 18 - year old girls. Differences between individual groups are statistically significant in all of the morphological and motor variables. Girls in <b>general</b> <b>programmes</b> have better morphological structure than other two groups, which are discriminated only slightly in morphological structure. Presumably these differences are a result of different socio-economic environments that determine the quality of nutrition. Girls in <b>general</b> <b>programmes</b> also achieved best results in test of all the motor variables, followed by the girls in technical programmes and the girls in vocational schools. All the differences are probably a result of factors, which influence the completion of motor programmes, as well smaller quantity of physical education lessons in the vocational programmes...|$|E

30|$|To {{combat the}} high level of {{unemployment}} among immigrants and to foster their employment uptake, governments use Active Labour Market Programmes (ALMPs).

30|$|<b>General</b> <b>programmes</b> {{exclusively}} for immigrants comprise general ALMPs other than language courses (training, subsidised private or public sector employment, job search assistance and sanctions) targeted at immigrants (and not at natives). One example {{for such an}} intervention is intensified job search assistance programmes, where immigrants are assigned to caseworkers whose caseload is reduced. That is, caseworkers have more time for the counselling and support of each individual. See, e.g., Aslund and Johansson ([2011]) for a programme of this kind in Sweden.|$|E
