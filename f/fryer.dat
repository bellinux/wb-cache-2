5|$|Deep frying (also {{referred}} to as deep fat frying) is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, rather than the shallow oil used in conventional frying, done in a frying pan. Normally, a deep <b>fryer</b> or chip pan is used for this; industrially, a pressure <b>fryer</b> or vacuum <b>fryer</b> may be used. Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot. Deep frying is classified as hot-fat cooking method. Typically, deep frying foods cook quickly: all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously as oil has {{a high rate of}} heat conduction.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying is {{done with}} a deep <b>fryer,</b> a pan such as a wok or chip pan, a Dutch oven, or a {{cast-iron}} pot. Additional tools include fry baskets, which are used to contain foods in a deep <b>fryer</b> and to strain foods when removed from the oil, and cooking thermometers, used to gauge oil temperature. Tongs, slotted spoons, wooden spoons, and sieves {{may be used to}} remove or separate foods from the hot oil.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying {{requires}} a deep <b>fryer</b> or other device {{in which the}} chicken pieces can be completely submerged in hot fat. The process of deep frying is basically placing food fully in oil and then cooking it {{at a very high}} temperature. The pieces are prepared as described above. The fat is heated in the deep <b>fryer</b> to the desired temperature. The pieces are added to the fat and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process.|$|E
40|$|Electric <b>fryers</b> have {{recently}} been used more {{in the field of}} commercial cookery and the factors are investigated. On the investigation, {{it turned out that the}} running cost is less with electric <b>fryers</b> than with gas <b>fryers</b> and the share of gas <b>fryers</b> has been taken away by electric <b>fryers.</b> To maintain and increase the share of city gas, therefore, we started to develop energy saving technologies of gas <b>fryers.</b> In about three years past, we developed 8 models of 3 series and realized energy saving of 36 % to 50 % compared with conventional gas <b>fryers.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Electric {{restaurant}} <b>fryers</b> {{are popular}} in counter top models {{because of their}} mobility. They lose a little less heat than gas <b>fryers</b> because their heating elements are immersed in the oil, {{and they have a}} faster temperature recovery time between frying cycles. Gas <b>fryers</b> heat up more quickly and to a higher cooking temperature than electric <b>fryers.</b> Gas <b>fryers</b> can be powered by either natural gas or propane, both of which are generally less expensive energy sources than electricity. This makes gas power especially popular in floor model <b>fryers.</b>|$|R

5|$|In Robinson, Texas, Lucy <b>Fryer</b> {{was murdered}} while alone {{at her house}} on May 8, 1916. She and her husband George were English immigrants, and had become well {{respected}} in the rural community where they operated a farm. News of the death quickly reached the McLennan County sheriff, Samuel Fleming, who immediately investigated {{with a team of}} law enforcement officers, a group of local men, and a doctor. The doctor determined that <b>Fryer</b> had been killed by blunt-force trauma to the head. The local men suspected that Jesse Washington, a seventeen-year-old black man who had worked on the Fryers' farm for five months, was responsible; one of them stated that he had seen Washington near the <b>Fryer</b> house a few minutes before Lucy's body was discovered. That night, sheriff's deputies traveled to Washington's home, finding him {{in front of the house}} wearing blood-stained overalls. He attributed the stains to a nosebleed. Jesse, his brother William, and their parents were taken to nearby Waco to be questioned by the sheriff's department; although Jesse's parents and brother were released after a short time, he was held for further interrogation. His questioners in Waco reported that he denied complicity in Fryer's death, but offered contradictory details about his actions. Rumors spread after his arrest that he had been in an altercation with a white man a few days before the murder.|$|E

50|$|Commercial <b>fryers</b> are {{generally}} available in mild steel or stainless steel. Stainless steel {{is less likely}} to corrode or stain than mild steel. Mild steel also expands under heat which may damage the welds over time. Because of this, stainless steel <b>fryers</b> often come with a much better warranty than mild steel <b>fryers.</b>|$|R

5|$|On May 9, Fleming took Washington to Hill County {{to prevent}} vigilante action. The Hill County sheriff, Fred Long, {{questioned}} Washington with Fleming; Washington {{told them he}} had killed <b>Fryer</b> following an argument about her mules, and described the murder weapon and its location. Long brought Washington to Dallas, Texas, while Fleming returned to Robinson. Fleming soon reported that he found a bloody hammer where Washington had indicated. In Dallas, Washington dictated and signed a statement that described the {{rape and murder of}} Fryer; the confession was published the next day in Waco newspapers. Newspapers sensationalized the murder, describing Fryer's attempts to resist Washington's attack, although the doctor who had examined her body concluded that she was killed before she could resist. A lynch mob assembled in Waco that night to search the local jail, but dispersed after they did not find Washington. Nevertheless, a local paper praised their effort. That night, a small private funeral and burial were held for Lucy <b>Fryer.</b>|$|E

Prepared mixes are used by some doughnut shops. Doughnut shops may prepare old-fashioned doughnuts by loading the batter into the hopper of a doughnut maker, which upon turning a hand crank, drops a formed doughnut into a deep <b>fryer.</b> Doughnut makers are also used for other doughnut varieties, such as cake doughnuts, yeast doughnuts, cream filled, and jelly filled doughnuts.|$|E

40|$|J aged cut-up <b>fryers</b> {{presently}} {{are based}} on existing standards for whole birds. Do the same standards apply to cut-up birds? Over {{a period of years}} this laboratory has used panels made up of laboratory personnel and experienced homemakers to determine the relative im-portance of various factors in existing standards for whole birds to over-all qual-ity and grade of cut-up <b>fryers.</b> The rela-tion of scalding temperatures to the eating quality also has been tested. These ob-servations may assist in the establishment of grading standards specifically for pack-aged cut-up <b>fryers</b> and help processors evaluate the importance of defects to the consumers. A parallel study of the effect of certain characteristics on store pur-chases is being carried out. Using a portable exhibit of 10 New York dressed <b>fryers,</b> each varying from Grade A in a single characteristic, Smith (1953) surveyed the choices of homemakers in 203 dwelling units in Wilmington, Dela-ware.

5|$|Deep frying {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of waste oil, which must be disposed of properly. Waste oil can overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls of sewage pipes, and interfere with sewage treatment. Waste oil from deep frying is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes {{the time required to}} deep fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep <b>fryer</b> draws 2,000 watts.|$|E
5|$|Fleming and {{the judge}} {{who presided over the}} trial each spoke with her; both argued that they did not deserve blame for the lynching. A schoolteacher who had known Washington told Freeman that Washington was illiterate, and that all {{attempts}} to teach him to read had been futile. Freeman concluded that white residents were generally supportive of Washington's lynching, although many disliked that his body was mutilated. She determined that the mob was led by a bricklayer, a saloonkeeper, and several employees of an ice company. The NAACP did not publicly identify them. Freeman concluded that Washington killed <b>Fryer,</b> and that he was motivated by her domineering attitude towards him.|$|E

Belgian club Standard Liège also expressed interest in <b>Fryers,</b> and as they are not an English club, they did not have to pay Manchester United the same level of compensation. <b>Fryers</b> signed a two-year contract with Liège on 23 August 2012. <b>Fryers</b> played in seven matches for Standard, but with the sacking of Ron Jans in November, he was left out of the squad and ultimately reported to his agent that he was homesick.|$|R
