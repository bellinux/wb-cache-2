5|$|One of {{the major}} points that Asch makes is that {{participants}} are not completely blind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> and making arbitrary choices based on this bias. Asch claims that participants were acting reasonable in their change of evaluation of the judgment because {{the context of the}} judgment and thus the meaning of the judgment had changed. Lorge, however, suggested that if the participants were behaving logical, their evaluations should have remained the same despite the change in author.|$|E
5|$|Blue Shift {{is set in}} {{the same}} {{location}} and time frame as that of Half-Life, taking place at a remote New Mexico laboratory called the Black Mesa Research Facility. In Half-Life, the player takes on the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist involved in an accident that opens an inter-dimensional portal to the borderworld of Xen, allowing the alien creatures of Xen to attack the facility. The player guides Freeman in an attempt to escape the facility and close the portal, ultimately traveling to Xen to do so. As in Opposing Force, Blue Shift shows the events of Half-Life {{from the perspective of a}} different protagonist. The player assumes the role of Barney Calhoun, a security guard working near the labs where the accident takes place. Calhoun is responsible for the preservation of equipment and materials and the welfare of research personnel, and after the accident turns Black Mesa into a warzone, he must work with Dr. Rosenberg, a high-ranking scientist involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiment,</b> to evacuate the facility.|$|E

In addition, the application of systemic (potassium phosphonate) with one and double injection (20 ml and 40 ml of fungicide for each injection frequency), and semi-systemic (metalaxyl) fungicide showed better control compared to contact fungicides (copper based fungicide) in both locations that were used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiment.</b>|$|E
