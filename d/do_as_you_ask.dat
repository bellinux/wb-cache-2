6000|$|... "I will <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me, but {{it seems}} to me that they will {{naturally}} wish to see you, seeing that, had it not been for your arrival, they might have been robbed and perhaps murdered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Countess," [...] he said, [...] "for your brother's {{sake and}} {{the sake of}} Theos I cannot <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask.</b> This man's silence {{for a few days}} at least is the one thing {{necessary}} to secure our success." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> about {{a friend}} of yours," [...] he said. This {{occurred}} just before the final and perfected list of the new men had appeared in all the newspapers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now that I have <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> me," [...] Ferrani concluded, [...] "let me add a word. Both {{these men}} are already off duty and have left the restaurant. If you wish to {{communicate}} with either of them, I advise you {{to do so by}} letter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{quite in}} earnest. I won't. If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> I <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> you shall {{talk to me}} till dinner-time, if you like it. There. Now you may begin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madame," [...] she said, [...] "it is not {{possible}} for me to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask.</b> Whatever plans are made for my future, it is to my dear friend here," [...] she said, looking across at me with shining eyes, [...] "that I owe everything. And as for Monsieur Feurgéres, I have promised him to occupy this box for this evening, and I shall do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Herr Freudenberg," [...] he said, [...] "there {{is but one}} {{weak point}} in all your chain of arguments. To <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask,</b> it will be {{necessary}} that I--I, Paul Jesen, so well-known, whose opinions are followed by millions of my country people--it would be necessary for me to abandon my convictions, to turn a right-about-face. Ask yourself, is it not like selling one's honor when one writes the things one does not believe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, I am blowed,” {{he exclaimed}} in intense astonishment. “The {{idea of a}} newly-joined boy wanting to be helped in {{navigation}} beats me altogether. However, lad, I will certainly <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me, though I cannot think that, unless you have been at a nautical school, you can know anything about it. But come to me this evening during the dog-watches, and then I will see what you have learned about the subject.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know <b>you</b> will <b>do</b> <b>as</b> I <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> if I {{tell you}} I am very earnest in it. Go away now, Trotwood, for my sake, and ask your friends {{to take you}} home.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Seth {{was pale}} and trembling: he felt there was some terrible secret under all this. [...] "Brother," [...] he said, faintly--he never called Adam [...] "Brother" [...] except in solemn moments--"I don't believe you'll <b>do</b> {{anything}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can't <b>ask</b> God's blessing on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Esther dear," [...] he said, [...] "I shall <b>do</b> just <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me. At {{the same}} time, please listen. I {{think that you}} are all absurdly frightened of Mr. Fentolin. Living here alone with him, you have all grown under his {{dominance}} to an unreasonable extent. Because of his horrible infirmity, you have let yourselves become his slaves. There are limits {{to this sort of}} thing, Esther. I come here as a stranger, and I see nothing more in Mr. Fentolin than a very selfish, irritable, domineering, and capricious old man. Humour him, by all means. I am willing to do the same myself. But {{when it comes to the}} great things in life, neither he nor any living person is going to keep from me the woman I love." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Felicia," [...] I said, [...] "I must <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me. If {{you tell}} me to go away, I will go away; {{but do you think}} it is quite kind to leave me so mystified? For instance," [...] I added slowly, [...] "on the night when that beast Louis planned to knock that young Brazilian on the head, and leave me to bear the brunt of it; he was up here talking to you, alone, as though you were equals." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear uncle," [...] said George, and as {{he spoke}} he rose from his seat, and {{crossing}} over to his uncle, took the old man's hand in his own. [...] "You shall be asked for no promise; you shall be asked for nothing. You have been most liberal, most kind to me; too kind, I know, for I have not returned it by that attention which you deserved from me. But, believe me, I cannot <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me. If you will speak to Miss Waddington, she {{will tell you the}} same." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes!" [...] she replied, graciously. [...] "I have {{an answer}} ready for you. You are so abrupt. Listen to what I propose. We will go {{together}} to your office and see whether {{it is true that}} Mr. Weatherley has not returned. If he has really disappeared, and I think that anything which I can tell you will help, perhaps then I will <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask.</b> It depends a great deal upon what you find in those papers. Shall we go now, or would you like to stay here a little longer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] {{said her}} future mother-in-law, [...] "what {{you say is}} {{undoubtedly}} true. There is no absolute necessity for hurrying. It is not an affair of life and death. But you and Harry have been engaged quite long enough now, and I really don't see why you should put it off. If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> he <b>asks</b> <b>you,</b> you will just have time to make yourselves comfortable before the cold weather begins." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The chief {{pleasure}} {{which my}} aunt has," [...] said Mr. Crawley, filling his glass, [...] "is {{that people should}} <b>do</b> <b>as</b> they like in her house. This is Liberty Hall, James, and you can't do Miss Crawley a greater kindness than to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> please, and <b>ask</b> for what <b>you</b> will. I know you have all sneered {{at me in the}} country for being a Tory. Miss Crawley is liberal enough to suit any fancy. She is a Republican in principle, and despises everything like rank or title." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe you}} are already {{beginning}} to treat me as a master," [...] she cried, tapping him with her fan upon the arm. [...] "Patience, patience! that should come in time. A woman loves to be obeyed at first, although afterwards she finds her pleasure in obeying. <b>Do</b> <b>as</b> I <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> for Heaven's sake, or I will answer for nothing. Indeed, now I think of it," [...] she added, with a manner of one who has just seen further into a difficulty, [...] "I find a better plan of keeping importunate visitors away. Tell the porter to admit no one for you, except a person who may come that night to claim a debt; and speak with some feeling, <b>as</b> though <b>you</b> feared the interview, so that he may take your words in earnest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Sir Percival, [...] "since you beseech that upon my knighthood I must needs <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask.</b> But I {{will only}} do so upon two {{conditions}}. The first of these conditions is that {{you go to the}} court of King Arthur, and that you surrender yourself as captive to a damsel of that court who is known as the Lady Yelande the Dumb Maiden. And you are to tell that maiden that the young knight who slew Sir Boindegardus greets her and that he tells her that in a little while he will return to repay to Sir Kay that buffet he gave her. This is my first condition." [...] And Sir Engeneron said: [...] "I will perform that condition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am an {{insignificant}} creature, I know, {{and perhaps the}} mite of my happiness or misery makes little difference in the scale of things; but to me the gift of all my love was everything. I gave it to you, Philip--gave it without a doubt or murmur, gave it with both hands. I can never have it back to give again! How you have treated it you best know." [...] Here she broke down a little, and then continued: [...] "It may seem curious, but though my love has been so mistakenly given; though you to whom it was given have dealt so ill with it; yet I am anxious that on my side {{there should be no}} bitter memory, that, in looking back at all this in after years, you should never be able to dwell upon any harsh or unkind word of mine. It is on that account, and also because I feel that it is not for me to judge you, and that you have already much to bear, that I <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me, and say, 'Philip, from my heart I forgive you, as I trust that the Almighty may forgive me.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Sir Launcelot sighed very deeply, and {{he looked}} steadfastly at the Lady Elaine, and he said: [...] "Lady, you know not how great a thing it is you ask of my pride, for I would fain remain unknown as I am at this present. And you know not {{what it is you}} ask of my knighthood, for wit ye it must be against my {{one-time}} friends and companions-in-arms that you would have me contend. So it is that if I should have success in such an affair as this, whatsoever credit I should win therein shall bring discredit unto them. Moreover, I must tell you that never in all of my life have I worn the favor of any lady, having vowed my knighthood to one who is a queen and the wife of a king. Natheless, though all this is so, yet far be it from me to refuse a boon when it is you who ask it of me. For I speak the truth, Lady, when I say that I would freely lay down my life at your bidding. So in this case, maugre all that I have said, I will even <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me, wherefore, if you will purvey me that armor of which you speak, I will do your will in all ways that I am able." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But if {{they have}} been exacted and have been made? <b>Do</b> <b>as</b> I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> now, and it is {{probable}} that everything will be clear to you before we return, or at any rate <b>as</b> clear to <b>you</b> <b>as</b> it is to me." [...] After this, with a certain spirit of reticence which was peculiar with him, he made up his mind to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> his mother would have him without asking further questions. He set himself to work immediately to make the necessary arrangements for his journey with as much apparent satisfaction as though it were to be done on his own behalf. It was decided that they would start on the next Friday, travel through France and by the tunnel of the Mont Cenis to Turin, and thence on to Milan. Of what further there was to befall them he knew nothing at this period.|$|R
60|$|PRESS. Well, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me, Lord William, I'll tell you. No {{newspapers}} {{for a month}} {{would do}} the trick.|$|R
6000|$|Lanfear {{thought he}} saw {{his way out of}} the coil. [...] "I can tell <b>you,</b> quite <b>as</b> frankly <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask,</b> that Miss Gerald isn't engaged to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure <b>you</b> don't. But <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me I {{must tell}} you what I think. You are {{in a sort of}} dilemma between this girl and Uncle Scroope." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then he took Jacob's gun, {{and blew}} {{down into the}} barrel of it. [...] "Now," [...] said he, [...] "you are as {{skillful}} a huntsman <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> to be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell <b>you</b> true, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me--there {{are some}} of Flint's hands aboard; worse luck {{for the rest of}} us." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her brother {{looked at}} her in silence. [...] "I am sorry," [...] he rejoined at last. [...] "But I was very discreet, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> me to be. I said nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|To this Sir Ewaine said: [...] "Sir, {{that would}} indeed {{be a very}} good thing for us to do, and we will be glad to go with <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me, I will. We'll {{have nothing}} more {{said about the}} duke, either now or when he comes back; not a word. Let me see--he's to be back;--when is it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never. But I shall {{always love}} you. If {{it would do}} any good, I would stay, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> it. I should n't mind myself. But I should be a {{nuisance}} to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't had an {{opportunity}} of telling you," [...] said George, [...] "that I called at Belgrave Square, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> me to <b>do.</b> I went there directly I had seen Reggie Byng safely married." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot take upon {{myself to}} answer that, Lady Kingsbury. The matter is one on which I am not {{particularly}} anxious to talk. Only <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> me I {{thought it best}} just {{to tell you the}} facts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They {{can sing}} the old war {{songs in the}} streets. They can get word-drunk, and make crowds, and invade privacy in the genuine old-fashioned way; and they'll do the voting trick <b>as</b> often <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> 'em a question.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had {{intended}} {{to speak to you}} shortly, father, but <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me I will do so at once. I have seen no one whom I could love so well as Mistress Ursula, daughter of Sir Robert Gaiton, and methinks that I am not indifferent to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was glad}} that Madame Leroux stayed upstairs with her maid instead of coming down here <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> her, mother; she looked so scared and white that I do {{think it would have}} been worse than {{listening}} to the fighting to have had to sit and look at her." ...|$|R
