The model can improve the effectiveness of the operator training system through interactively linking the trainee actions with the simulation model resulting in different accident scenarios with respect to each trainee’s competence when facing an accident.|$|R
50|$|In {{controlled}} {{testing in}} 1986, with the EBR-II reactor running {{at full power}} and the <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown</b> <b>systems</b> disabled, the reactor's supply of electricity was intentionally turned off, causing the coolant pumps to stop.

(At Fukushima, which began operation in 1971, the emergency shutdown system turned off the reactor as soon as it detected the earthquake. However the tsunami destroyed the electric generators powering the coolant pumps, which needed to continue running after the reactor shutdown. Subsequently, the core overheated and meltdown occurred.) EBR-II, in contrast, handled the event without creating a dangerous situation. EBR-II had a negative thermal coefficient of reactivity that shut down the reactor when the temperature increased due to loss of the coolant pumps; the time required to heat the large pool of sodium surrounding the reactor provided a sufficient time buffer for the passive decay heat removal system to prevent the EBR-II reactor from melting down. The safe shutdown of the EBR-II relied only on the laws of physics and did not require operator or control system intervention.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Design {{of modern}} {{powerful}} transistor generators with external exitation in meter and decameter wave ranges requires maximum utilisation of the transistor power capabilities. Transistors have no margins on the maximum permissible parameters and even minor derivations from normal mode can cause it fail. Known protection devices for band power amplifiers have a time constant greater than 20 - 30 us permissible overhead of transistor {{and can not}} protect the amplifier from short-circuit load or its failure. Helicon isolator at the output of transmitters for meter and decameter waves protects the transistor from the load mismatch and also decreases the intermodulation distortions level. The goal of this work is to study the on-turn transient of helicon isolator during the antenna break or short-circuit. Formulation of the problem. The maximum power dissipation in the helicon isolator depends on the maximum allowable temperature of the semiconductor resonator plate. In this work the transient processes in the helicon isolator after the sudden load mismatch are studied {{in order to reduce}} its sizes and weight for the given power level. Simulation. Temperature changes of the main part of helicon isolator ? helicon resonator with sizes 10 x 10 x 10 mm- 3 of indium antimonide dopped with tellurium with concentration 2. 1 1023 m- 3 are simulated in the approximation of one-dimensional model. The termal time constant was calculated. The resonator temperature variations are calculated with the different backward power levels. It is shown, that the time to reach the critical temperature 60 ?? for the isolator with 10 W dissipation power level is more than 0. 1 s and much more then required timeout for even simple <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown</b> <b>system</b> of the band power amplifier for transmitters. Experimental results. Experimental study of the helicon isolator transient shows that the reverse attenuation decreases from - 23 dB to - 20 db in 0. 6 s and to - 15 dB in 1. 1 s. This timeout is enough to protect the transistor amplifier of the transmitter in emergency mode up to the power supply shutdown. Conclusion. Helicon isolators are efficient protection of transistor transmitters from load mismatch in meter and decameter wave ranges. The reflected power is adsorbed in the isolator at antenna break or short-circuits. The thermal time constant of the isolator is enough for even the very simple <b>emergency</b> power <b>shutdown</b> <b>system</b> to switch. ? ?????? ????????? ????????????? ? ????????????????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????????? ???????????? ??????? ??? ????????? ???????? ????????????????. ????????, ??? ??? ?????? ??? ???????? ????????? ????????

The initial FMEDA added two additional pieces of information to the FMEA analysis process. The first piece of information added in an FMEDA is the quantitative failure data (failure rates and the distribution of failure modes) for all components being analyzed. The second piece of information added to an FMEDA is the probability of the system or subsystem to detect internal failures via automatic on-line diagnostics. This is crucial to achieving and maintaining reliability in increasing complex systems and for systems that may not be fully exercising all functionality under normal circumstances such as a low demand <b>Emergency</b> <b>Shutdown</b> <b>System,</b> ESD System.There is a clear need for a measurement of automatic diagnostic capability.

Consequently, vast amounts of near-miss data are available for analyzing the performances of the regulating (process control) and protection (<b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown)</b> <b>systems.</b> ^ A novel dynamic risk assessment methodology is introduced that uses the alarm databases to calculate the failure probabilities of regulating and protection systems, and the probabilities of the occurrence of incidents. The methodology consists of three steps: (i) tracking of abnormal events {{over an extended period}} of time, (ii) event-tree and set-theoretic formulations, and (iii) Bayesian analysis. New event-trees and set-theoretic formulations are introduced to compact the massive numbers (millions) of abnormal events, over several months of operation, leading to significant improvements in the efficiency of the probabilistic calculations and permitting Bayesian analysis of large databases in real-time. The Bayesian model accounts for the interdependences among the regulating and protection systems using copulas, which occur due to the nonlinear relationships between the variables and behavior-based factors involving human operators. As a case study, the methodology is applied to an industrial, fluidized-catalytic-cracking unit (FCCU) at a major petroleum refinery. ^ New performance indices, which utilize the abundant alarm data, are introduced to conduct quantitative and qualitative (absolute and relative) assessment of the real-time safety and operability performances.

40|$|Abstract — Standby {{redundant}} systems are often adopted in critical {{applications such as}} the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Shutdown</b> <b>Systems</b> (ESDS) in Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). One failure mode of the standby {{redundant systems}} {{is that they are}} not available when there is a demand. This is a serious safety issue. Another failure mode of the standby safety critical systems is that they function spuriously when there is actually no need. Once this occurs, the normal plant operation will be interrupted; certain equipment could be damaged; and restarting the plant could be very costly. The objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the unavailability and the probability of spurious operation of k-outof-n systems when they are subjected to both independent and Common Cause Failures (CCFs). A load-strength interference model is adopted for CCF analysis. A data mapping technique is utilized when there is no data available for a specific system. It is concluded quantitatively that the k-out-of-n system has a lower unavailability but a higher probability of spurious operation than the k-out-of-(n − 1) system, under both independent failure and CCFs. This result complies with common sense and practical experience. The two different configurations adopted in different types of NPPs, the 2 -out-of- 3 system and the 2 -out-of- 4 system, are used to demonstrate the theoretical analyses that are developed in this paper. However, due to the lack of lack of relevant data, the analysis of probability of spurious operation under CCFs are only explained in a qualitative manner...|$|E

The correct prediction {{of the negative}} reactivity introduced in the moderator by an <b>Emergency</b> Boron <b>Shutdown</b> <b>System</b> (EBSS) is of great relevance for the correct safety evaluation of a double-ended guillotine large break LOCA scenario. During such event the EBSS is in charge to compensate the insertion of positive reactivity, caused by the void generated in the coolant channels by a sharp system pressure drop, {{in order to avoid}} severe core damage. The correct simulation of such event implies the minimization of the so called ‘‘numeric boron self-shielding effect’’ or the over-estimation of the inserted negative reactivity caused by the adoption of relatively large numerical meshes. In fact, because during the first phases of the injection, a very high concentrated boron solution is introduced in a small volume of the moderator tank, non-conservative reactivity estimation can be calculated if a ‘‘numeric boron dilution’’ is resulting by the adoption of large thermal-hydraulic and neutronic meshes. A methodology based on Monte Carlo transport code MCNP 5 has been developed in order to predict power and reactivity excursions, representing a boron distribution in the moderator with different spatial resolutions. In such a way, it was possible to investigate the negative reactivity over-estimation due to the ‘‘boron self-shielding effect’’.
