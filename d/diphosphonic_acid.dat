Experimental data have been obtained by in situ measurements of the velocities of barite monomolecular steps growing from solutions with different concentrations of each phosphonic acid. Adsorption isotherms, constructed by plotting individual monomolecular step rates versus inhibitor concentrations, indicate a Langmuir adsorption mechanism in the range of concentrations from 0. 5 to 10 lmol/l. Both affinity constants calculated from adsorption isotherms and measurements of growth rates of barite monomolecular steps as a function of inhibitor concentration allowed us to give the following ranking of inhibitor effectiveness: PBTC>NTMP>MDP>HEDPAMP. Molecular simulations of the interaction of the phosphonic acids with barite(0 0 1) surfaces indicate that only kink sites along monomolecular steps can be considered as possible inhibition sites.

40|$|Polynuclear copper(II) {{derivatives}} of 1 -hydroxyethylidenediphosphonic acid (HEDP), 1 -aminoethylidenediphosphonic acid (AEDP, H 4 L), α-aminobenzylidene <b>diphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (ABDP, H 4 L), 1 -amino- 2 -carboxyethane- 1, 1 -diphosphonic acid (ACEDP, H 5 L), 1, 3 diaminopropane- 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetra-phosphonic acid (DAPTP, H 8 L), Ethylenediamine-N,N'-bis (dimethyl-methylenephosphonic) acid (EDBDMPO, H 4 L), o-phenylene-diamine-N,N'-bis (dimethylmethylenephosphonic) acid (PDBDMPO, H 4 L), diethylene triamine –N,N,N',N',N"N-penta (methylene phosphonic) acid (DETAPMPO, H 10 L) and diethylene triamine –N,N"-bis (dimethyl methylene phosphonic) acid (DETBDMPO, H 4 L) {{have been}} prepared in aqueous medium. The general formula of derivatives from elemental analysis {{was found to be}} Cu 2 L. XH 2 O (in case of AEDP, ABDP, EDBDMPO, PDBDMPO, DETBDMPO), Cu 5 L 2. XH 2 O (in case of ACEDP) Cu 4 L. XH 2 O, Cu 2 H 4 L. XH 2 O (in case of DAPTP) and Cu 5 L. XH 2 O (in case of DETAPMPO). The electronic spectra have shown them to be six coordinated with slight distortion from octahedral geometry. Antiferromagnetism was inferred from magnetic moment data. Infrared spectral studies were carried out to determine coordination sites. EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) spectra that supports the presence of tetragonal distortion and antiferromagnetic behaviour, have also been studied...|$|E
40|$|The {{suitability}} {{of the computer}} package LUMPAC to calculate the photoluminescence properties of metal–organic frameworks was assessed by considering three systems based on the ditopic 1, 4 -phenylenebis(methylene) <b>diphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (H 4 pmd) ligand and Ln 3 + ions, namely, [Eu(Hpmd) (H 2 O) ] (1), [La 2 (H 2 pmd) (pmd) (H 2 O) 2] (2) and [La 2 (H 2 pmd) 3 (H 2 O) 12] (3, previously reported) and their isotypical materials doped with Eu 3 + cations, [(La 0. 95 Eu 0. 05) 2 - (H 2 pmd) (pmd) (H 2 O) 2] (4) and [(La 0. 95 Eu 0. 05) 2 (H 2 pmd) 3 - (H 2 O) 12] (5). These materials were prepared, and their structures and luminescence properties were characterized. A straightforward approximation based on the simple crystallographic structural subunits of these materials was used and resulted in an excellent agreement between the calculated and experimental properties. The intramolecular energy transfer and back-transfer rates were predicted, and the T 1 5 D 1 channel was shown to be the dominant pathway (9. 03 104 s– 1 for 1, 1. 06 104 s– 1 for 4 and 2. 18 105 s– 1 for 5) ...|$|E
40|$|Two sandwich-type polyoxomolybdates Na 8 [MO 2 {Mo 2 O 5 (O 3 PCH 3 C(O) PO 3) } 2] (M = Ni 2 + (1); Co 2 + (2)) were {{synthesized}} by {{one-pot reaction}} of Na 2 HPMo 12 O 40 · 14 H 2 O, 1 -hydroxy ethidene <b>diphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (HEDP=HOC(CH 3) (PO 3 H 2) 2), and (1) NiCl 2 /CoCl 2 (2). Compounds 1 and 2 {{were characterized by}} single crystal X-ray analysis, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), IR spectroscopy, 31 P NMR spectra, UV-vis spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). Structural analysis reveals that 1 and 2 exhibit similar centrosymmetric structure, which consists of one transition metal (TM) ion sandwiched by two same subunits {Mo 2 O 5 (O 3 PCH 3 C(O) PO 3) }. The clusters 1 and 2 show efficient catalytic activities for oxidation of thioanisole. Moreover, they are catalytically selective for oxidizing thioanisole. Both resuable polyoxomolybdates 1 and 2 catalysts show good thermo- and hydrolytic stability. It is noted that compound 1 shows outstanding catalytic activity for oxidation of various sulfides to corresponding sulfones with 93 – 100 % selectivity at 97 – 100 % conversion in one hour under mild conditions, which is potentially valuable to the removal of organic sulfides...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of {{low levels of}} radionuclides in environmental and biological samples is often hampered by the complex and variable nature of the samples. One approach to circumventing this problem is to incorporate into the analytical scheme a separation and preconcentration step by which the species of interest can be isolated from the major constituents of the sample. Extraction chromatography (EXC), a form of liquid chromatography in which the stationary phase comprises an extractant or a solution of an extractant in an appropriate diluent coated onto an inert support, provides a simple and efficient means of performing {{a wide variety of}} metal ion separations. Recent advances in extractant design, in particular the development of extractants capable of metal ion recognition or of strong complex formation even in acidic media, have substantially improved the utility of the method. For the preconcentration of actinides, for example, an EXC resin consisting of a liquid <b>diphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> supported on a polymeric substrate has been shown to exhibit extraordinarily strong retention of these elements from acidic chloride media. This resin, together with other related materials, can provide the basis of a number of efficient and flexible schemes for the separation and preconcentration of radionuclides form a variety of samples for subsequent determination...|$|E
40|$|Shortcomings of {{chelating}} resins {{have been addressed}} by {{a new class of}} ion exchange resins called dual mechanism bifunctional polymers (DMBPs). DMBPs use hydrophilic cation exchange ligands with rapid uptake kinetics and use chelating ligands for selectivity for one or more metals; result is a resin that quickly recognizes and removes targeted metals from waste, remediation, and process streams. Eichrom`s Diphonix {reg_sign} resin is the first DMBP to be widely released as a commercial product; it is polystyrene based. Objective of this work is to synthesize commercial quantities of a silica-based ion exchange resin with the same or better metal ion selectivity, metal uptake kinetics, and acid stability as Diphonix. Feasibility was determined, however the process needs to be optimized. Studies at Eichrom and ANL of the performance of Diphonix resin over a broad range of HNO 3 and HCl conditions and inorganic salt loadings are discussed together with the proposed method of incorporating similar characteristics into a silica-based resin. The new, silica-based resin functionalized with <b>diphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> ligands can be used in environmental restoration and waste management situations involving processing of low-level, transuranic, and high-level radioactive wastes; it can also be used for processing liquid mixed waste including wastes contaminated with organic compounds...|$|E
40|$|Significant (31) P NMR signal {{enhancement}} through heteronuclear polarisation transfer {{was obtained}} in model solutions and in vivo on a 1. 5 -T whole-body MR scanner equipped with two RF channels. The much higher population differences involved in proton Zeeman energy levels {{can be transferred}} to the (31) P levels with the refocused INEPT (insensitive nucleus enhancement by polarisation transfer) double-resonance experiment by means of a series of simultaneously applied broadband RF pulses. INEPT achieves a polarisation transfer from (1) H to (31) P spin states by directly reordering the populations in spin systems with heteronuclear scalar coupling. Thus, only the (31) P NMR signal of metabolites with scalar (1) H-(31) P coupling is amplified, while the other metabolite signals in the spectra are suppressed. Compared to Ernst-angle excitation, a repetition-time-dependent signal enhancement of eta=(29 +/- 3) % for methylene <b>diphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (MDPA) and eta=(56 +/- 1) % for phosphorylethanolamine (PE) was obtained on model solutions through optimisation of the temporal parameters of the pulse experiment. The results are in good agreement with numerical calculations of the theoretical model for the studied spin systems. With optimised echo times, in-vivo (31) P signal enhancement of the same order was obtained in studies of the human brain...|$|E
