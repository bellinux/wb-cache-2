5|$|HDMI <b>Ethernet</b> Channel {{technology}} consolidates video, audio, {{and data}} streams {{into a single}} HDMI cable, and the HEC feature enables IP-based applications over HDMI and provides a bidirectional <b>Ethernet</b> communication at 100Mbit/s. The physical layer of the <b>Ethernet</b> implementation uses a hybrid to simultaneously send and receive attenuated 100BASE-TX type signals through a single twisted pair.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ethernet</b> {{standards}} require {{electrical isolation}} between the networked device (computer, phone, etc.) {{and the network}} cable up to 1500VAC or 2250VDC for 60seconds. USB has no such requirement as it was designed for peripherals closely associated with a host computer, and in fact it connects the peripheral and host grounds. This gives <b>Ethernet</b> a significant safety advantage over USB with peripherals such as cable and DSL modems connected to external wiring that can assume hazardous voltages under certain fault conditions.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.4 was {{released}} on May 28, 2009, and the first HDMI 1.4 products were available {{in the second half}} of 2009. HDMI 1.4 added support for 4K×2K, i.e. 4096×2160 at 24Hz (which is a resolution used with digital theaters), 3840×2160 (Ultra HD) at 24Hz/25Hz/30Hz, and support for 1080p at 120Hz. It also added an HDMI <b>Ethernet</b> Channel (HEC) which allows for a 100Mbit/s <b>Ethernet</b> connection between the two HDMI connected devices so they can share an Internet connection, introduced an audio return channel (ARC), 3D Over HDMI, a new Micro HDMI Connector, an expanded set of color spaces with the addition of sYCC601, Adobe RGB and Adobe YCC601, and an Automotive Connection System. HDMI 1.4 defined several stereoscopic 3D formats including field alternative (interlaced), frame packing (a full resolution top-bottom format), line alternative full, side-by-side half, side-by-side full, 2D + depth, and 2D + depth + graphics + graphics depth (WOWvx). HDMI 1.4 requires that 3D displays implement the frame packing 3D format at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24. High Speed HDMI cables as defined in HDMI 1.3 work with all HDMI 1.4 features except for the HDMI <b>Ethernet</b> Channel, which requires the new High Speed HDMI Cable with <b>Ethernet</b> defined in HDMI 1.4.|$|E

5|$|An HDMI {{cable is}} {{composed}} of four shielded twisted pairs, with impedance {{of the order of}} 100Ω (±15%), plus seven separate conductors. HDMI cables with <b>Ethernet</b> differ in that three of the separate conductors instead form an additional shielded twisted pair (with the CEC/DDC ground as a shield).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the modest}} {{popularity}} of IBM Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless <b>Ethernet</b> facilities. At the physical layer, most wired <b>Ethernet</b> implementations use copper twisted-pair cables (including the common 10BASE-T networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers. When optic fibers are used, the distinction {{must be made}} between multimode fibers and single-mode fibers. Multimode fibers {{can be thought of}} as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation – implying poorer long-distance performance.|$|E
5|$|For the unibody {{polycarbonate}} MacBook (2009), {{the ports}} {{from left to}} right are the MagSafe power connector, Gigabit <b>Ethernet,</b> Mini DisplayPort, 2 USB 2.0 ports, audio out and Kensington Security Slot.|$|E
5|$|The ports {{are all on}} {{the left}} edge; on early models, from left to right, they are the MagSafe power connector, Gigabit <b>Ethernet,</b> mini-DVI, FireWire 400, 2 USB 2.0 ports, audio in, audio out and Kensington Security Slot.|$|E
5|$|The second {{generation}} Wink Hub supports most smart home devices with Zigbee, ZWave, Lutron Clear Connect, and Kidde protocols. Wink 2 also added Bluetooth Low Energy, 5GHz Wi-Fi radio, an <b>Ethernet</b> port, and 512MB of memory.|$|E
5|$|The vkernel runs {{on top of}} {{hardware}} abstractions provided by the real kernel. These include the kqueue-based timer, the console (mapped to the virtual terminal where vkernel is executed), the disk image and virtual kernel <b>Ethernet</b> device (VKE), tunneling all packets to the host's tap interface.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s the {{university}} renovated and constructed many buildings. The BGSU Fine Arts Center received a $9.8 million addition {{in the early}} 1990s. Founders Hall was reopened in 1994 after extensive renovations {{at a cost of}} $15 million. That same year BGSU opened Olscamp Hall. East Hall opened in 1998. All residence halls received wiring for <b>Ethernet</b> connections.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that 3GB of RAM would be reserved for the operating system and utility software, leaving 5GB for games. With DirectX 11.2 as the console's API, the graphics processing unit (GPU) {{is based on an}} AMD GCN architecture with 12 compute units, which have a total of 768 cores, running at 853MHz providing an estimated peak theoretical power of 1.31 TFLOPS. For networking, Xbox One supports Gigabit <b>Ethernet,</b> 802.11n wireless, and Wi-Fi Direct.|$|E
5|$|Monster began {{manufacturing}} and marketing USB and <b>ethernet</b> cables {{as well as}} power strips and power management products in 2009. It's been producing its own line of headphones since 2012 and also manufactures celebrity-branded headphones. Monster sells speakers under the Clarity and Katana brands and mobile accessories like an iPod dock and a line-up of Tron-branded products.|$|E
5|$|On October 18, 2006, the MX Series was {{publicly}} announced. Before its release, <b>Ethernet</b> aggregation was {{a missing}} component of Juniper's edge network products, which was {{causing it to}} lose market-share to Alcatel. The MX Series was late to market, but it was well received by analysts and customers. It {{was part of a}} trend at-the-time to incorporate additional software features in routers and switches.|$|E
5|$|Several {{versions}} of HDMI {{have been developed}} and deployed since initial release of the technology but all use the same cable and connector. Other than improved audio and video capacity, performance, resolution and color spaces, newer versions have optional advanced features such as 3D, <b>Ethernet</b> data connection, and CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) extensions.|$|E
5|$|Whereas Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) {{are typical}} data-link {{protocols}} for larger networks such as WANs; <b>Ethernet</b> and Token Ring are typical data-link protocols for LANs. These protocols {{differ from the}} former protocols {{in that they are}} simpler, e.g., they omit features such as quality of service guarantees, and offer collision prevention. Both of these differences allow for more economical systems.|$|E
5|$|A {{cluster is}} a group of loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so that in some respects they can be regarded as a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster {{do not have to be}} symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP <b>Ethernet</b> local area network. Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. The vast majority of the TOP500 supercomputers are clusters.|$|E
5|$|Because grid {{computing}} systems (described below) {{can easily}} handle embarrassingly parallel problems, modern clusters are typically {{designed to handle}} more difficult problems—problems that require nodes to share intermediate results with each other more often. This requires a high bandwidth and, more importantly, a low-latency interconnection network. Many historic and current supercomputers use customized high-performance network hardware specifically designed for cluster computing, such as the Cray Gemini network. As of 2014, most current supercomputers use some off-the-shelf standard network hardware, often Myrinet, InfiniBand, or Gigabit <b>Ethernet.</b>|$|E
5|$|Elgato {{introduced}} a Thunderbolt docking station in June 2014. A computer is {{plugged into the}} dock using a Thunderbolt port {{in order to gain}} access to the dock's three USB ports, audio jacks, HDMI and <b>ethernet.</b> It is typically used to plug a Macbook into an office setting (printer, monitor, keyboard) or to provide additional ports not available in the Macbook Air. A review in The Register said it was compact and useful, but Windows users should consider a USB 3.0 dock. The Register and CNET disagreed on whether it was competitively priced. Reviews in TechRadar and Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E
5|$|In late 2008, Fortinet {{acquired}} the database security and auditing intellectual property of IPLocks, and extended job offers to the company's 28 employees. It {{acquired the}} intellectual property {{and other assets}} of Woven Systems, an <b>ethernet</b> switching company, in August 2009. According to IDC, by {{this time it was}} the largest unified threat management vendor, with a 15.4 percent market-share. The company had been growing steadily and became profitable after losing money from 2004 - 2007. Fortinet was also rising in CRN Magazines survey-based annual report card (ARC), reaching first place in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Introduced in HDMI 1.4, HDMI <b>Ethernet</b> and Audio Return Channel (HEAC) adds a {{high-speed}} bidirectional data communication link (HEC) {{and the ability}} to send audio data upstream to the source device (ARC). HEAC utilizes two lines from the connector: the previously unused Reserved pin (called HEAC+) and the Hot Plug Detect pin (called HEAC−). If only ARC transmission is required, a single mode signal using the HEAC+ line can be used, otherwise, HEC is transmitted as a differential signal over the pair of lines, and ARC as a common mode component of the pair.|$|E
5|$|Released in , {{four years}} after the launch of the {{original}} PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 2 Slimline was the first major redesign of the PlayStation 2. Compared to its predecessor, the Slimline was smaller, thinner, quieter and also included a built-in <b>Ethernet</b> port (in some markets it also has an integrated modem). In , Sony began shipping a revision of the Slimline which was lighter than the original Slimline together with a lighter AC adapter. In , Sony released yet another revision of the Slimline which had an overhauled internal design incorporating the power supply into the console itself like the original PlayStation 2 resulting in a further reduced total weight of the console.|$|E
5|$|The IEEE 802.3af Power over <b>Ethernet</b> (PoE) {{standard}} specifies a {{more elaborate}} power negotiation scheme than powered USB. It operates at 48VDC and can supply more power (up to 12.95W, PoE+ 25.5W) over a cable up to 100meters compared to USB2.0, which provides 2.5W {{with a maximum}} cable length of 5meters. This has made PoE popular for VoIP telephones, security cameras, wireless access points, and other networked devices within buildings. However, USB is cheaper than PoE provided that the distance is short and power demand is low.|$|E
5|$|The NeXT Computer {{was based}} on the new 25MHz Motorola 68030 central {{processing}} unit (CPU). The Motorola 88000 RISC chip was originally considered, but was not available in sufficient quantities. It included between 8 and 64 MB of random-access memory (RAM), a 256 MB magneto-optical (MO) drive, a 40 MB (swap-only), 330 MB, or 660 MB hard disk drive, 10BASE2 <b>Ethernet,</b> NuBus and a 17-inch MegaPixel grayscale display measuring 1120 by 832 pixels. In 1989 a typical new PC, Macintosh, or Amiga computer included a few megabytes of RAM, a 640×480 16-color or 320x240 4000-color display, a 10 to 20 megabyte hard drive and few networking capabilities.|$|E
5|$|The iPad can use Wi-Fi network {{trilateration}} from Skyhook Wireless {{to provide}} location information to {{applications such as}} Google Maps. The 3G model supports A-GPS to allow its position to be calculated with GPS or relative to nearby cellphone towers; {{it also has a}} black strip on the back to aid 3G reception. The iPad has a headphone jack and a proprietary Apple dock connector, but no <b>Ethernet</b> or USB port. However, the Apple Camera Connection Kit accessory provides two dock connector adapters for importing photos and videos via USB and SD memory cards.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{original}} 15- and 17-inch model MacBook Pros come with ExpressCard/34 slots, which replace the PC Card slots {{found in the}} PowerBook G4. All first generation 15-inch models have two USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire 400 port, while the 17-inch models have three USB 2.0 ports {{as well as one}} FireWire 400 port. When first introduced, the MacBook Pro did not come with FireWire 800 or S-Video ports, although FireWire 800 was added in the next 15-inch model revision and is present in every version of the 17-inch design. S-Video capability can be attained {{through the use of a}} DVI to S-Video adapter. External displays with up to a 2,560×1,600 pixel resolution are supported through a dual-link DVI port. All models include a built-in Gigabit <b>Ethernet</b> port, Bluetooth 2.0, and 802.11a/b/g. Later models include support for the draft 2.0 specification of 802.11n and Bluetooth 2.1.|$|E
5|$|For {{external}} connectivity, the Mac Pro included five USB 2.0 ports, two FireWire 400 and two FireWire 800 (Late 2006 until Early 2008), respectively four FireWire 800 (Early 2009 until Mid 2012) ports. Networking {{was supported}} with two built-in Gigabit <b>Ethernet</b> ports. 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi support (AirPort Extreme) required an optional module in the Mid 2006, Early 2008 and Early 2009 models, {{whereas in the}} 2010 model and later Wi-Fi was standard. Bluetooth also required an optional module in the Mid 2006 model, but was standard in the Early 2008 and newer models. Displays were supported by one or (optionally) more PCIe graphics cards. More recent cards featured two Mini DisplayPort connectors and one dual-link Digital Visual Interface (DVI) port, with various configurations of on-card graphics memory available.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September 1940, George Stibitz {{transmitted}} {{problems for}} his Complex Number Calculator in New York using a teletype, {{and received the}} computed results back at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. This configuration of a centralized computer (mainframe) with remote dumb terminals remained popular well into the 1970s. However, already in the 1960s, researchers started to investigate packet switching, a technology that sends a message in portions to its destination asynchronously without passing it through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on 5 December 1969, constituting {{the beginnings of the}} ARPANET, which by 1981 had grown to 213 nodes. ARPANET eventually merged with other networks to form the Internet. While Internet development was a focus of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) who published a series of Request for Comment documents, other networking advancement occurred in industrial laboratories, such as the local area network (LAN) developments of <b>Ethernet</b> (1983) and the token ring protocol (1984).|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2012, Apple showcased its {{upgraded}} Mac notebooks, OS X Mountain Lion, and iOS 6 at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco. The new MacBook Pro {{models were}} updated with Ivy Bridge processors and USB 3.0 ports, and the default RAM on premium models was increased to 8 GB. Following this announcement, the 17-inch model was discontinued. After a media event on October 22, 2013 Apple discontinued all second generation MacBook Pros {{except for the}} entry-level 2.5GHz 13-inch model. Apple discontinued the 13-inch 2nd generation MacBook Pro on October 27, 2016. Prior to its discontinuation it was Apple’s only product to still include an optical drive and a Firewire port, and only laptop with a hard disk drive and <b>Ethernet</b> port.|$|E
5|$|The Internet {{works in}} part because of {{protocols}} that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an Internet browser to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an <b>Ethernet</b> or Wi-Fi connection. Protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other data}} buses (e.g., <b>Ethernet,</b> HDMI), USB {{connections}} are directed, with both {{upstream and downstream}} ports emanating from a single host. This applies to electrical power, with only downstream facing ports providing power; this topology was chosen to easily prevent electrical overloads and damaged equipment. Thus, USB cables have different ends: A and B, with different physical connectors for each. Therefore, in general, each different format requires four different connectors: a plug and receptacle {{for each of the}} A and B ends. USB cables have the plugs, and the corresponding receptacles are on the computers or electronic devices. In common practice, the A end is usually the standard format, and the B side varies over standard, mini, and micro. The mini and micro formats also provide for USB On-The-Go with a hermaphroditic AB receptacle, which accepts either an A or a B plug. On-The-Go allows USB between peers without discarding the directed topology by choosing the host at connection time; it also allows one receptacle to perform double duty in space-constrained applications.|$|E
25|$|Using CobraNet {{and fast}} <b>Ethernet,</b> 64 {{channels}} of uncompressed digital audio are carried through a single category 5 cable. Using gigabit and/or fiber optic <b>Ethernet</b> variants, {{the cost of}} cabling per audio channel is reduced compared to the fast <b>Ethernet</b> connections. CobraNet data can also coexist with data traffic over existing <b>Ethernet</b> networks, a single network infrastructure can serve audio distribution and other networking needs.|$|E
25|$|Other {{special-purpose}} physical layers include Avionics Full-Duplex Switched <b>Ethernet</b> and TTEthernet — Time-Triggered <b>Ethernet</b> for embedded systems.|$|E
25|$|Other {{networking}} standards {{do not use}} the <b>Ethernet</b> frame format but {{can still}} be connected to <b>Ethernet</b> using MAC-based bridging.|$|E
25|$|For {{customers}} with more demanding requirements (such as medium-to-large businesses, or other ISPs) can use higher-speed DSL (such as single-pair high-speed digital subscriber line), <b>Ethernet,</b> metropolitan <b>Ethernet,</b> gigabit <b>Ethernet,</b> Frame Relay, ISDN Primary Rate Interface, ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and synchronous optical networking (SONET).|$|E
25|$|Some {{networking}} {{standards are}} not part of the IEEE 802.3 <b>Ethernet</b> standard, but support the <b>Ethernet</b> frame format, and are capable of interoperating with it.|$|E
