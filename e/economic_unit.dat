25|$|The {{agricultural}} {{reforms of}} the early 1980s led to a confusingly large number of new production arrangements and contracts. Underlying the variability of administrative and contractual forms were several basic principles and trends. In the first place, land, the fundamental means of production, remained collective property. It was leased, allocated, or contracted to individual households, but the households did not own the land and could not transfer it to other households. The household became, in most cases, the basic <b>economic</b> <b>unit</b> and was responsible for its own production and losses. Most economic activity was arranged through contracts, which typically secured promises to provide {{a certain amount of}} a commodity or sum of money to the township government in return for the use of land, or workshops, or tractors.|$|E

25|$|Prior to European {{settlement}} and colonisation of New Zealand, Māori had a subsistence economy, the basic <b>economic</b> <b>unit</b> {{of which was}} the sub-tribe or hapū. From the 1790s, the waters around New Zealand were visited by British, French and American whaling, sealing and trading ships. Their crews traded European goods, including guns and metal tools, for Māori food, water, wood, flax and sex. Their increasing lawlessness and plans for formal settlement by the New Zealand Company were two of the drivers behind the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, which established New Zealand as a colony. Settlers continued to be dependent on Māori for food until the 1860s. From then immigrants became self-sufficient in farming, and started quarrying a variety of minerals including gold, which was discovered at Gabriel's Gully in Central Otago, leading to the Otago Gold Rush in 1861. Settlements flourished in areas where these quarries were established. In the 1880s, Dunedin became the richest city in the country largely on the back of investments from the gold rush.|$|E
25|$|Vietnam's {{recorded}} history stretches {{back to the}} mid-to-late 3rd century BCE, when Âu Lạc and Nanyue (Nam Việt in Vietnamese) were established (Nanyue conquered Âu Lạc in 179 BCE). Pre-historic Vietnam was {{home to some of}} the world's earliest civilizations and societies—making them one of the world's first people who practiced agriculture. The Red River valley formed a natural geographic and <b>economic</b> <b>unit,</b> bounded to the north and west by mountains and jungles, to the east by the sea and to the south by the Red River Delta. The need to have a single authority to prevent floods of the Red River, to cooperate in constructing hydraulic systems, trade exchange, and to fight invaders, {{led to the creation of}} the first Vietnamese states approximately 2879BC. Another truly influential part of history in Vietnam occurred during the late Bronze Age, when the Đông Sơn culture dramatically advanced the civilization. Vietnam's peculiar geography made it a difficult country to attack, which is why Vietnam under the Hùng kings was for so long an independent and self-contained state. The Xích Tỵs and Qins were among the earliest foreign aggressors of Vietnam, but the ancient Vietnamese managed to regain control of the country soon after the invasions.|$|E
25|$|Kovel {{uses the}} term “Eco-socialist revolution” to {{describe}} the transition to an eco-socialist world society. In the immediate socio-political transition, he believes that four groups will emerge from the revolution – revolutionaries, those “whose productive activity is directly compatible with ecological production” (such as nurses, schoolteachers, librarians, independent farmers and many other examples), those “whose pre-revolutionary practice was given over to capital” (including the bourgeoisie, advertising executives and more) and “the workers whose activity added surplus value to capitalist commodities”. In terms of political organisation, he advocates an “interim assembly” {{made up of the}} revolutionaries that can “devise incentives to make sure that vital functions are maintained” (such as short-term continuation of “differential remuneration” for labor), “handle the redistribution of social roles and assets”, convene “in widespread locations”, and send delegates to regional, state, national and international organisations, where every level has an “executive council” that is rotated and can be recalled. From there, he asserts that “productive communities” will “form the political as well as <b>economic</b> <b>unit</b> of society” and “organize others” to make a transition to eco-socialist production; he adds that people will be allowed to be members of any community they choose with “associate membership” of others, such as a doctor having main membership of healthcare communities as a doctor and associate membership of child-rearing communities as a father. Each locality would, in Kovel’s eyes, require one community that administered the areas of jurisdiction through an elected assembly. High-level assemblies would have additional “supervisory” roles over localities to monitor the development of ecosystemic integrity, and administer “society-wide services” like transport in “state-like functions”, before the interim assembly can transfer responsibilities to “the level of the society as a whole through appropriate and democratically responsive committees”.|$|E

At the time, the main agricultural college in the USSR was in Moscow, and students did not do the manual labor of farming. Khrushchev proposed to move the programs to rural areas. He was unsuccessful, due to resistance from professors and students, who never actually disagreed with the premier, but who did not carry out his proposals. Khrushchev recalled in his memoirs, [...] "It's nice to live in Moscow and work at the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy.

500|$|Seminal {{though this}} moment was, {{it was just}} a start. As his biographer, WK Hancock, noted: [...] "All the same, [...] knew that nations are not made by {{administrative}} arrangements alone". In The Conditions of Future South African Literature, his next essay of significance, he dealt with the other significant factor in nation-building - the cultural and emotional ties needed to form a united community. Within this essay, not at first sight written on an overtly political topic, Smuts declared that a true South African literature did not and could not exist until a true South African nation had been born. The question then arose - what was hindering this development? Smuts identified the inhibiting factor as the relations between Briton and Boer - particularly the effect of the influx of British emigrants to the gold mines of the Transvaal on the deeply conservative Afrikaner population. The relations between these two groups were fraught; the discover of gold and the rapid industrialisation of the Transvaal had done much to disturb the settled ways of the Boer population. With its vast mineral wealth the Transvaal was rapidly becoming the most significant <b>economic</b> <b>unit</b> of South Africa, but the sudden tide of primarily British immigrants caused a great deal of unrest, with the established population decrying the immorality and degeneracy they perceived in the new mineworkers. These divisions, though strongest in the Transvaal, existed to one degree or another throughout South Africa. Smuts, though sympathising with the concerns of the old population, fearful their established ways and traditions would be swamped in a flood of migration, urged the Afrikaners to embrace the new spirit of dynamism which he saw the new migrants injecting. Likewise he exhorted the new population to integrate with the old, to consolidate the white population both {{for the sake of a}} future South African nation but also to secure their survival in the face of the vastly greater Native population.|$|E
30|$|In the {{economic}} literature, small, medium and large units are abundantly {{used as the}} concept of the size of <b>economic</b> <b>units.</b> There is not a general rule or a standard for distinguishing <b>economic</b> <b>units</b> in this way, like most of the countries, there is not a joint definition or single for dividing <b>economic</b> <b>units</b> and hence attaining a signal viewpoint in Turkey. In this study, for dividing <b>economic</b> <b>units</b> in manufacturing industries of Turkey, the division of the “Ministry of Support and Development of Small, Medium and Large Industries” (KOSGEB) has been considered as the base and groundwork. According to the definition of this ministry, units that employ 1 – 50 employees are considered as a small unit, units employing 51 – 150 employees are regarded as medium units and units employing more than 150 employees are considered as large units. Considering this division, and with reference to the available statistics and data for this research, it can be observed that most of the available units are in the group of small or large units and only a few of them are in the group of medium units. For this reason, and also for not facing with the problem of degree of freedom, the medium units will be analyzed and evaluated alongside with large units. Therefore, all of the manufacturing industries of Turkey are summarized in eight subsections, and each of these subsections has been divided into two subgroups of small, medium and large units.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that innovation {{is fundamental to}} economic success. This requires that a range {{of public and private}} institutions share their knowledge, as well as the risk and rewards of innovation.

2500|$|During Saxon times {{land was}} {{described}} in both terms of its economic value {{and in terms of}} an absolute size.

Of particular interest was the rood which was 15 [...] feet in length, the North German foot being equivalent to 335mm (13.2inches). Craftsmen, on the other hand used a shorter Roman foot. Some time between 1266 and 1303 the weights and measures of England were radically revised by a law known as the Composition of Yards and Perches (Compositio ulnarum et perticarum) often known as the Compositio for short. This law, attributed to either Henry III or his successor Edward I, instituted a new foot that was exactly [...] the length of the old foot, with corresponding reductions {{in the size of the}} yard, ell, inch, and barleycorn.

2500|$|There {{are also}} case based {{exceptions}} to the Salomon principle, though their restrictive scope is not wholly stable. The present rule under English law is that only where a company {{was set up to}} commission fraud, or to avoid a pre-existing obligation can its separate identity be ignored. This follows from a Court of Appeal case, Adams v Cape Industries plc. A group of employees suffered asbestos diseases after working for the American wholly owned subsidiary of Cape Industries plc. They were suing in New York to make Cape Industries plc pay for the debts of the subsidiary. Under conflict of laws principles, this could only be done if Cape Industries plc was treated as [...] "present" [...] in America through its US subsidiary (i.e. ignoring the separate legal personality of the two companies). Rejecting the claim, and following the reasoning in Jones v Lipman, the Court of Appeal emphasised that the US subsidiary had been set up for a lawful purpose of creating a group structure overseas, and had not aimed to circumvent liability in the event of asbestos litigation. The potentially unjust result for tort victims, who are unable to contract around limited liability and may be left only with a worthless claim against a bankrupt entity, has been changed in Chandler v Cape plc so that a duty of care may be owed by a parent to workers of a subsidiary regardless of separated legal personality. However even though tort victims are protected, the restrictive position remains subject to criticism where a company group is involved, since {{it is not clear that}} companies and actual people ought to get the protection of limited liability in identical ways. An influential decision, although subsequently doubted strongly by the House of Lords, was passed by Lord Denning MR in DHN Ltd v Tower Hamlets BC. Here Lord Denning MR held that a group of companies, two subsidiaries wholly owned by a parent, constituted a single <b>economic</b> <b>unit.</b> Because the companies' shareholders and controlling minds were identical, their rights were to be treated as the same. This allowed the parent company to claim compensation from the council for compulsory purchase of its business, which it could not have done without showing an address on the premises that its subsidiary possessed. Similar approaches to treating corporate [...] "groups" [...] or a [...] "concern" [...] as single economic entities exist in many continental European jurisdictions. This is done for tax and accounting purposes in English law, however for general civil liability the rule still followed is that in Adams v Cape Industries plc. It is very rare for English courts to lift the veil. The liability of the company is generally attributed to the company alone.|$|E
