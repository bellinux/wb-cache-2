5|$|The {{national}} debt increased {{as a result}} during Hamilton's service as Secretary of the Treasury, but the nation established its good credit.

5|$|After Metternich's {{studies in}} Vienna, the Prince's death in September 1797 allowed Metternich to {{participate}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> of Rastatt. Initially his father took {{him as a}} secretary while ensuring that, when proceedings officially started in December 1797, he was named {{the representative of the}} Catholic Bench of the College of the Counts of Westphalia. A bored Metternich remained at Rastatt in this role until 1799 when the congress was finally wound down. During this period Eleonore had chosen to live with Metternich at Rastatt and gave birth to sons Francis (February 1798) and, shortly {{after the end of the}} Congress, Klemens (June 1799). Much to Metternich's anguish Klemens died after only a few days, and Francis soon contracted a lung infection from which he would never recover.|$|E

5|$|Although {{strongly}} {{urged by}} moderates in Congress {{to sign the}} bill, President Andrew Johnson vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen {{at a time when}} 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress,</b> and that it discriminated in favor of African-Americans and against whites. Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law. Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress really possessed constitutional power to turn those goals into laws. The experience also encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.|$|E
5|$|Fort Greble was an American Civil War-era Union {{fortification}} {{constructed as}} part of the defenses of Washington, D.C. during that war. Named for First Lieutenant John Trout Greble, the first West Point graduate killed in the U.S. Civil War, it protected the junction of the Anacostia and Potomac rivers, and from its position on a bluff <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> Heights, precluded any bombardment of the Washington Navy Yard and southeastern portions of the city. It was supported by Fort Carroll to the northeast and Fort Foote to the south. It never fired a shot during the war, and after a brief stint as a U.S. Army Signal Corps training facility, was abandoned and the land returned to its natural state. As of July 2007, the site of the fort is a community park.|$|E
5|$|Hayes, an {{attorney}} in Ohio, was city solicitor of Cincinnati from 1858 to 1861. When the Civil War began, he left a fledgling political career to join the Union Army as an officer. Hayes was wounded five times, most seriously at the Battle of South Mountain. He earned a reputation for bravery in combat and was promoted {{to the rank of}} brevet major general. After the war, he served <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> from 1865 to 1867 as a Republican.

5|$|When Néstor Kirchner {{refused to}} run for {{re-election}} in 2007 and proposed Cristina Kirchner instead, it was rumored that the couple might attempt {{to run for}} the presidency in alternate elections, to circumvent the constitutional limit of a single re-election. The death of Néstor Kirchner in 2010 derailed such a plan. She had a low positive image, below 30%. On 21 June 2011, Cristina Kirchner announced she would run for a second term as president. A few days later, she announced that her economic minister Amado Boudou would run for vice-president on her ticket. This selection was an unexpected one, as Boudou usually acted like a rock star instead of a politician. She personally chose most of the candidates for deputy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress,</b> favoring members of the Cámpora.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín died {{at home on}} 31March 2009, {{at the age of}} 82, {{after being}} {{diagnosed}} a year before with lung cancer. The streets around his house at the Santa Fe avenue were filled with hundreds of people, who started a candlelight vigil. The radical Julio Cobos, Fernández de Kirchner's vice president, was the acting president at the moment and ordered three days of national mourning. There was a ceremony <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress,</b> where his body was displayed in the Blue Hall, that was attended by almost a thousand people. His widow María Lorenza Barreneche could not attend the funeral, because of her own poor health. It was attended by former presidents Carlos Menem, Fernando delaRúa, Eduardo Duhalde and Néstor Kirchner, {{all the members of the}} Supreme Court of Argentina, mayor Mauricio Macri, governor Daniel Scioli, the president of Uruguay Tabaré Vázquez and several other politicians. The coffin was moved to La Recoleta Cemetery. He was placed next to the graves of other important historical figures of the UCR, such as Leandro N. Alem, Hipólito Yrigoyen and Arturo Illia.|$|E
5|$|E.V. Ramasamy {{joined the}} Indian National Congress in 1919 after quitting his {{business}} and resigning from public posts. He held the chairmanship of Erode Municipality and wholeheartedly undertook constructive programs spreading the use of Khadi, picketing toddy shops, boycotting shops selling foreign cloth, and eradicating untouchability. In 1921, Periyar courted imprisonment for picketing toddy shops in Erode. When his wife {{as well as his}} sister joined the agitation, it gained momentum, and the administration was forced to come to a compromise. He was again arrested during the Non-Cooperation movement and the Temperance movement. In 1922, Periyar was elected the President of the Madras Presidency Congress Committee during the Tirupur session, where he advocated strongly for reservation in government jobs and education. His attempts were defeated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> party due to a strong presence of discrimination and indifference, which led to his leaving the party in 1925.|$|E

5|$|In 1865, Congress passed {{what would}} become the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing {{citizenship}} without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the Black Codes passed by many post-war Southern states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and by preventing them from suing or testifying in court. Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill, President Johnson vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress,</b> and that it discriminated in favor of African Americans and against whites. Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law.

Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress possessed the constitutional power to turn those goals into laws. The experience encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, a bill {{to reduce}} the tariff was {{narrowly}} defeated in the House. The tariff issue was emphasized in the Congressional elections that year, and the forces of protectionism increased their numbers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress,</b> but Cleveland continued to advocate tariff reform. As the surplus grew, Cleveland and the reformers called for a tariff for revenue only. His message to Congress in 1887 (quoted at right) highlighted the injustice of taking more money from the people than the government needed to pay its operating expenses. Republicans, as well as protectionist northern Democrats like Samuel J. Randall, believed that American industries would fail without high tariffs, and they continued to fight reform efforts. Roger Q. Mills, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed {{a bill to}} reduce the tariff from about 47% to about 40%. After significant exertions by Cleveland and his allies, the bill passed the House. The Republican Senate failed to come to agreement with the Democratic House, and the bill died in the conference committee. Dispute over the tariff persisted into the 1888 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|In 341BC Demosthenes {{was sent}} to Byzantium, where he sought to renew its {{alliance}} with Athens. Thanks to Demosthenes' diplomatic manoeuvres, Abydos also entered into an alliance with Athens. These developments worried Philip and increased his anger at Demosthenes. The Assembly, however, laid aside Philip's grievances against Demosthenes' conduct and denounced the peace treaty; so doing, in effect, amounted to an official declaration of war. In 339BC Philip made his last and most effective bid to conquer southern Greece, assisted by Aeschines' stance in the Amphictyonic Council. During {{a meeting of the}} Council, Philip accused the Amfissian Locrians of intruding on consecrated ground. The presiding officer of the Council, a Thessalian named Cottyphus, proposed the convocation of an Amphictyonic Congress to inflict a harsh punishment upon the Locrians. Aeschines agreed with this proposition and maintained that the Athenians should participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress.</b> * C. Carey, Aeschines, 7–8. Demosthenes however reversed Aeschines' initiatives and Athens finally abstained. After the failure of a first military excursion against the Locrians, the summer session of the Amphictyonic Council gave command of the league's forces to Philip and asked him to lead a second excursion. Philip decided to act at once; in the winter of 339–338BC, he passed through Thermopylae, entered Amfissa and defeated the Locrians. After this significant victory, Philip swiftly entered Phocis in 338BC. He then turned south-east down the Cephissus valley, seized Elateia, and restored the fortifications of the city.* K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 283; H. Weil, Biography of Demosthenes, 41–42.|$|E

5|$|She {{was elected}} {{national}} senator in the 1995 general elections. She opposed most bills proposed by Menem, {{such as a}} treaty with Chilean president Patricio Aylwin that benefited Chile {{in a dispute over}} the Argentina–Chile border. The Minister of Defense Oscar Camilión was questioned in Congress about the Argentine arms trafficking scandal; Kirchner told him that he had to resign, which he refused to do. As a result, she made a name for herself as a troublemaker. She was removed from the PJ bloc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1997 for misconduct. She resigned her senatorial seat that year and ran for national deputy in the 1997 midterm elections instead. Menem ended his term of office in 1999 and was replaced by Fernando de la Rúa.

5|$|Southern Whigs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congress,</b> {{including}} Representative Milton Brown and Senator Ephraim Foster, both of Tennessee, and Representative Alexander Stephens of Georgia collaborated {{to introduce}} a House amendment on January 13, 1845 {{that was designed to}} enhance slaveowner gains in Texas beyond those offered by the Democratic-sponsored Tyler-Calhoun treaty bill. The legislation proposed to recognize Texas as a slave state which would retain all its vast public lands, as well as its bonded debt accrued since 1836. Furthermore, the Brown amendment would delegate to the U.S. government responsibility for negotiating the disputed Texas-Mexico boundary. The issue was a critical one, as the size of Texas would be immensely increased if the international border were set at the Rio Grande River, with its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains, rather than the traditionally recognized boundary at the Nueces River, 100 miles to the north. While the Tyler-Calhoun treaty provided for the organization of a total of four states from the Texas lands – three likely to qualify as slave states – Brown's plan would permit Texas state lawmakers to configure a total of five states from its western region, south of the 36°30' Missouri Compromise line, each pre-authorized to permit slavery upon statehood, if Texas designated them as such.|$|E
