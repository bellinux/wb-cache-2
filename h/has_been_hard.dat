The new centre, located on the outskirts of KL, opened in July 2006. It will employ between 70 and 92 workers. Under an innovative Public-Private partnership, the municipality is working with Rosko Forestry Operations to establish a specialty sawmill in the Archer Drive Industrial Park that will sell into the Canadian market.|$|E

25|$|Many {{factors can}} affect marital and/or {{parenting}} difficulties, {{but there has}} not been any evidence found that can link these issues specifically to ACOAs. Research has been conducted to try to identify issues that arise when someone is a COA. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> to isolate these issues solely {{to the fact that the}} child’s parents are alcoholics. Other behaviors need to be studied, like dysfunctional family relationships, childhood abuse and other childhood stressors and how they may contribute to things like depression, anxiety and bad relationships in ACOAs.|$|E
25|$|Others, like Sir Robert Thompson, {{himself an}} ex-Chindit, have {{asserted}} that the idea behind the Chindits was a sound one, but {{that they were just}} badly handled and used in operations for which they were not properly equipped or trained, for example in static defence. A third view is that, despite the relatively insignificant losses that the Chindits were able to inflict, their propaganda value in 1943, {{at a time when the}} Army was on the defensive, was a morale boost to the people of India and Britain, and helping to dispel the image of Japanese invincibility. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> to reach a consensus on any of these issues due to the partisan nature of the discussions surrounding Wingate himself.|$|E

The association of the building with Nazism <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> to shake off, despite its outstanding 1920s architecture. Der Spiegel wrote about the [...] "Smell of Guilt" [...] after its public opening in 1995, but also that the building itself did not deserve the bad reputation.

500|$|Doc Kuhn is {{possibly}} the greatest ball {{player on the}} squad, due to his miraculous fielding around short this season. Starting with the opening college games he went for six straight games without an error, finally putting Tot McCullough off the bag with a wide heave that broke the run. The Michigan and Ohio coaches were loud in their praises for Kuhn {{as one of the}} greatest fielding shortstops they had seen in some time. His hitting this season <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> and timely, including a homer, four triples, and three doubles. He hits in streaks, however, and this alone will keep the phenomenal Vandy star out of a major berth in the near future. Kuhn, Embry and McCullough stand out head and shoulders above anybody in their respective lines that has visited here in recent years.|$|E

The skull was low, with rugose (rough and wrinkled) nasal bones and a ridge-like crest on the lacrimal bone in front of the eye. The front of the lower jaw was flattened, and had a downwards projecting process (or [...] "chin") at the tip. The teeth were compressed sideways and had serrations. The neck was strong and the pectoral girdle proportionally small.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{appearance}} of the many German Grand Lodges dates from the 1740s, notably [...] "Of the Three Globes", founded in Berlin in 1744, which became the [...] "Grand National Mother Lodge" [...] in 1772. Frederick the Great became a Freemason {{while he was still}} Crown Prince and personally sanctioned the Berlin Lodge. Although a few authors cite the existence of German operative grand lodges as far back as that formed at Cologne Cathedral in 1250, continuity of tradition <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> to prove, and most sources believe the Eighteenth-century German speculative lodges show descent from the English model.|$|E

[...] "At {{the end of the}} day, however, we have realized that these factors cannot rigidly control, and we have come back to saying that the standards are 'fluid concepts that take their substantive content from the particular contexts' in which they are being assessed." [...] The best distinction might be that prior to conducting an evidence search, a law enforcement officer must have knowledge that raises a “fair probability,” or a “substantial chance,” of discovering evidence of criminal activity, while school officials need only a [...] "moderate chance" [...] of finding evidence of wrongdoing.|$|E

2500|$|These social {{problems}} that Faragher was suffering {{at this time}} were perhaps eclipsed by the serious economic problems that he encountered due to the dire state of the traditional crofting way {{of life on the}} island. In the 1890s Faragher began to find it increasingly difficult to make a living as a fisherman and a small-scale farmer. In 1898 Faragher wrote (in his imperfect English) of that year's fishing that, [...] "It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> times we could not catch mackerells enough to eat sometimes." [...] By this time Faragher was in his 60s and was beginning to be afflicted by rheumatism, from which he was to suffer increasingly and which threatened to keep him from work entirely. These problems were then compounded by what he saw to be the unfair treatment he received from farmers who kept wages unfairly low. A poem he wrote on this subject features the following stanza: ...|$|E
2500|$|Evidence that is {{consistent}} with conventional theories of why democracy emerges and is sustained <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> to come by. Recent statistical analyses have challenged modernisation theory by demonstrating that there is no reliable evidence for the claim that democracy is more likely to emerge when countries become wealthier, more educated, or less unequal. Neither is there convincing evidence that increased reliance on oil revenues prevents democratisation, despite a vast theoretical literature on [...] "the Resource Curse" [...] that asserts that oil revenues sever the link between citizen taxation and government accountability, seen as the key to representative democracy. The lack of evidence for these conventional theories of democratisation have led researchers to search for the [...] "deep" [...] determinants of contemporary political institutions, be they geographical or demographic. More inclusive institutions lead to democracy because as people gain more power, they are able to demand more from the elites, who in turn have to concede more things to keep their position. This virtuous circle, may end up in democracy.|$|E
