Youngblood concluded, [...] "I wasn’t the biggest guy, I certainly wasn’t the strongest and I wasn’t the fastest either.

500|$|In early 2010, {{a primary}} {{challenge}} from {{radio talk show}} host and former U.S. Congressman J. D. Hayworth materialized in the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Arizona and drew support from some but not all elements of the Tea Party movement. With Hayworth using the campaign slogan [...] "The Consistent Conservative", McCain said – despite his own past use of the term {{on a number of occasions}} – [...] "I never considered myself a maverick. <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> <b>a</b> person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities." [...] The primary challenge coincided with McCain reversing or muting his stance on some issues such as the bank bailouts, closing of the Guantánamo Bay detention camp, campaign finance restrictions, and gays in the military.|$|E

For in truth there are really two kinds of Modernism to be uncovered in the space of the last two and a half centuries, and it is to the first and largest of these that I belong and to which, in my small way, I contribute. This is the Modernism that was born in neo-classicism and has, as its great central titan, the mighty Richard Wagner." ...|$|E

Challenged in 1974 over his serious demeanor in concerts {{and the military}} salutes he ended them with, Cohen remarked, [...] "I sing serious songs, and I'm serious onstage because I couldn't do it any other way...I don't consider myself a civilian. <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> <b>a</b> soldier, and that's the way soldiers salute." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, in a {{town hall}} meeting in Pennsylvania debating the Jewish Tradition with Martin Amis, Hitchens commented on his {{political}} philosophy by stating, [...] "I am no longer a socialist, but I still am a Marxist". In a June 2010 interview with The New York Times, he stated that [...] "I still think like a Marxist in many ways. I think the materialist conception of history is valid. <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> <b>a</b> very conservative Marxist". In 2009, in an article for The Atlantic entitled [...] "The Revenge of Karl Marx", Hitchens frames the late-2000s recession in terms of Marx's economic analysis and notes how much Marx admired the capitalist system that he called for the end of, but says that Marx ultimately failed to grasp how revolutionary capitalist innovation was. Hitchens was an admirer of Che Guevara, yet in an essay written in 1997, he distanced himself from Che, and referred to the mythos surrounding him as a [...] "cult". In 2004 he re-emphasized his positive view of Che, commenting that [...] " [...] death {{meant a lot to me}} and countless like me at the time. He was a role model, albeit an impossible one for us bourgeois romantics insofar as he went and did what revolutionaries were meant to do—fought and died for his beliefs." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Foreign Ministers of ASEAN {{member states}} {{determined}} that {{invitation to the}} inaugural East Asian Summit, {{the first of which}} is to be held in late 2005 and hosted by Malaysia, was to be restricted to parties to the treaty. The Howard Government in Australia, although seeking invitation, was reluctant to accede to the treaty claiming it was out of date and might conflict with obligations and rights it had under other treaties. However, with entry to the Summit confined to parties to the treaty, and with domestic pressure to sign, Australia decided in early 2005 to sign the treaty on the condition that its rights under the UN Charter are recognised as inalienable. Upon the announcement of accession, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer was asked whether or not he considered himself an east Asian, he replied: [...] "Do <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> <b>an</b> East Asian? ... <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> <b>an</b> Australian." ...|$|R

The archdeacon is intimate there, and they have always a good kind of people staying in the house. Mrs. Arrowpoint is peculiar, certainly; something of a caricature, in fact; but well-meaning.
