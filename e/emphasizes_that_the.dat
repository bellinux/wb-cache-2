In both texts, Wollstonecraft <b>emphasizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> virtue of the British nation is dependent on the virtue of its people. To a great extent, she collapses the distinction between private and public and demands that all educated citizens be offered the chance to participate in the public sphere.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, 1813, Alejandro Ramírez {{arrived to}} Puerto Rico and almost {{immediately}} {{was named to the}} office of Intendant, eventually establishing a Consulate of Commerce to control trade in Puerto Rico. Originally from Guatemala, where he had served in various political positions, Ramírez was {{also a member of the}} Philadelphia Philosophical Society. The Diario Económico de Puerto Rico, a newspaper specialized in the archipelago's economy, noted that during the time banknotes of all denominations were still being forged in large quantities. The publication claimed that the counterfeits were most likely produced in other locations of the Caribbean, this was based on the fact that only one royal press existed in Puerto Rico. However, modern researchers maintain that the copies could have been produced locally in a clandestine manner. This is based on a report that <b>emphasizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> designs of false 8-real notes were crude and that the ink used spread when touched, something that wouldn't be possible if produced elsewhere, particularly because the ink would dry in the voyage between countries. During this time, paper notes began disappearing and the stated recurred to renewing old pieces.|$|E

25|$|Another {{theory on}} {{cultural}} assimilation {{centers on the}} racial/ethnic disadvantage model. This theory <b>emphasizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> process of assimilation for certain immigrant groups is blocked due to their race or ethnicity, meaning that discrimination in society and in the workplace hinders assimilation into mainstream U.S. society. The major critique of this theory is that it overstresses social barriers along racial and ethnic lines without providing adequate explanations for why many second-generation immigrants overcome these barriers and experience socioeconomic mobility.|$|E
25|$|In this hypothesis, the {{apparent}} trend towards more complex organisms {{is an illusion}} resulting from concentrating on {{the small number of}} large, very complex organisms that inhabit the right-hand tail of the complexity distribution and ignoring simpler and much more common organisms. This passive model <b>emphasizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> overwhelming majority of species are microscopic prokaryotes, which comprise about half the world's biomass and constitute the vast majority of Earth's biodiversity. Therefore, simple life remains dominant on Earth, and complex life appears more diverse only because of sampling bias.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} demonstrated, however, that resultatives exist {{independently}} of the perfect in sentences like I turned this offer down, creating the need to reexamine the role of resultatives. To address this, it has been claimed that the resultative expresses both a state and the preceding action it has resulted from. This <b>emphasizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resultative describes how a state was acted upon. Therefore, it must use the passive form. However, this analysis {{does not account for}} phrases such as I turned this offer down, which uses the active rather than the passive voice.|$|E

Historian Olivier Wieviorka <b>emphasizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> strategy of these movements was often, in fact to put women into missions that required visibility, since they were less exposed to repression: the Vichy government of occupied France and the German military were not able to fire on French women demanding food for their children.|$|E
25|$|Escott {{argues that}} Davis {{was unable to}} {{mobilize}} Confederate nationalism {{in support of his}} government effectively, and especially failed to appeal to the small farmers who comprised the bulk of the population. In addition to the problems caused by states rights, Escott also <b>emphasizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> widespread opposition to any strong central government combined with the vast difference in wealth between the slave-owning class and the small farmers created insolvable dilemmas when the Confederate survival presupposed a strong central government backed by a united populace. The prewar claim that white solidarity was necessary to provide a unified Southern voice in Washington no longer held. Davis failed to build a network of supporters who would speak up when he came under criticism, and he repeatedly alienated governors and other state-based leaders by demanding centralized control of the war effort.|$|E

500|$|Pat Wheeler, {{a scholar}} of literature, {{describes}} the narrative style as [...] "both naturalistic and realistic and {{very much in the}} manner of the nineteenth century writers [...] cites as literary influences"—Wheeler notes Émile Zola, Charles Dickens and George Gissing among these. Wheeler <b>emphasizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> naturalistic tendencies of the narrative allow treatment of the war setting without an idealization of the [...] "human" [...] parts of the narrative. Consistently, reviews emphasize the novel's imagery of the battle experience in and amongst the trenches. For Slade, the novel [...] "produces a vivid and traumatizing description of {{the sights and sounds of}} life and death in (and under the trenches)"; the principal cause of this, he says, is [...] "the pure fury and intensity of the imagery created page after page".|$|E

500|$|After this, Anonymus continues, a {{division}} of the Magyar army advanced towards the Mezeş Gates, under the command of Szabolcs and Tas, and occupied the fortress of Satu Mare, while a second division, led by Tétény, [...] "conquered a great number of people" [...] in the Nyírség. The two divisions rejoined at the Mezeş Gates, where [...] "the dwellers of the land built stone gateways and a great obstacle of trees" [...] in accordance with the Magyar leaders' orders to defend the borders of their newly conquered lands. Anonymus <b>emphasizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> three Magyar commanders were very proud that [...] "they had subjected almost all the nations" [...] of Menumorut's duchy. Tas and Szabolcs decided to return to Árpád, [...] "subduing the whole people from the Someș River to the Criș River" [...] on their way. Menumorut was at this point planning to escape to the Byzantine Empire, but his warriors prevented Szabolcs and Tas from crossing the Criş at Szeghalom, thus forcing the Magyars to temporarily retreat.|$|E
500|$|Religion {{is also a}} {{dominant}} theme of The Historian. Dracula is Christian and, as Bebergal explains, [...] "Much of what is frightening in the novel is the suggestion of heretical Christian practices and conspiratorial monks." [...] Kostova herself notes {{that the world is}} still [...] "wracked by religious conflict", therefore historical fiction about the topic is relevant. The portions of the novel set in Istanbul, for example, highlight {{the extent to which the}} real Vlad detested the Ottomans, waging holy war upon them. More specifically, Amir Taheri in Asharq Alawsat argues that the novel highlights the relationship between the West and Turkey. The West, which is laden with the [...] "dead" [...] weight of this past (represented by the vampires) needs the help of Turkey (and perhaps the entire Muslim world) to recover. As Taheri points out, one of the most appealing characters in the novel is Professor Bora, a Turkish professor who is part of an ancient Ottoman society dedicated to defeating Dracula. Taheri <b>emphasizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> novel highlights that [...] "Western civilisation and Islam have common enemies represented by 'vampires' such as postmodernism in Europe and obscurantism in the Muslim world".|$|E

[...] On the album review, Cobo also commented that [...] "this [...] is a refreshing outing." [...] All About Jazz' Mark Corroto {{stated that the}} album proves that the performer [...] "has plenty of heart rooted in a traditional Cuban music past and a head pointed into a diverse North American future." [...] Matt Cibula of PopMatters stated that Supernova is a [...] "wonderful record, that proves that Rubalcaba {{is one of the}} greatest composers and pianist in the world," [...] but was critical about the lack of emotional commitment to his music, concluding that the album would work better on an audience that never heard the performer before. Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ grade, arguing that it [...] "neatly showcases Rubalcaba's strengths: unerring yet playful rhythm, technical ferocity when required, burnished balladry, and Cuban swagger blended with jazz suavity." [...] George Tysh of Metro Times stated that Supernova [...] "incorporates both Rubalcaba personalities, being more percussively rhythmic (definitely more Latin) than Inner Voyage, but still as sensitive." [...] Jazz Review granted the album a perfect score of five stars, with Don Williamson stating that the album [...] "continues to prove that Rubalcaba is dedicated to the authenticity, the tradition and the spirit of the Cuban music he studied and which is part of his being." [...] The Rubalcaba's biography included on the book Jazz for Dummies (2006) by Dick Sutro, <b>emphasizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> album founds the performer on his peak form.|$|E
