The Committee endorses its previous recommendation that <b>irradiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> is an acceptable and safe practice when {{carried out in}} accordance with the Codex Alimentarius Commission general standard for irradiated food and the Codex Code of Practice for the operation of radiation facilities for irradiated foods in international trade. The practice has the potential (or reducing food wastage and spoilage...|$|E
40|$|Application of {{ionizing}} radiation treatment of foods on an industrial scale {{started in the}} early 1980 s after the joint Food and Agriculture Organization/International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) /World Health Organization (WHO) expert committee accepted {{the application of a}} 10 -kGy overall average dose for foods. Vast knowledge has now accumulated on the chemical and biological effects of ionizing irradiation, which has contributed to the promotion of its utilization. Irradiation is used as a food preservation method to destroy microorganisms and increase shelf life. The radiation dose unit, previously referred to as the rad, is currently known as the Gray (Gy). The Gy is the absorption of 1 J of energy per kilogram irradiated material and is equivalent to 100 rads. Irradiation doses usually range from 10 Gy to 1 kGy for sprouting inhibition of potatoes, onions, garlic, etc.; 1 to 10 kGy for fresh meat and seafood as well as vegetables and fruits; and 10 to 100 kGy mainly for food sterilization. The recommended dose levels are as follows: low level at 1 kGy to inhibit insect infestation and delay ripening; medium level at 1 - 10 kGy to reduce bacterial load (particularly of pathogens); and high level at 10 - 50 kGy for commercial sterilization and elimination of viruses. <b>Irradiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> has an additional advantage: it can be used in prepackaged foodstuffs to avoid microbial recontamination, in addition to allowing the use of different packaging materials. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The American Nuclear Society endorses the {{expanded}} use <b>of</b> food <b>irradiation</b> technology {{as part of}} a comprehensive program to improve the safety of the food supply. Based on continual irradiation safety evaluations for more than 40 years, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved <b>irradiation</b> <b>of</b> various <b>foodstuffs</b> including wheat, potatoes, processed pork, herbs and spices, poultry, and molluscan shellfish. In 1986, the list was expanded to include fruits and vegetables, and in 1997, red meat was added. In 2008, the FDA allowed for increased irradiation dosages in lettuce and spinach sufficient to destroy diseasecausing bacteria. 1 Over decades of study the FDA and other international organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Health Organization have consistently concluded the following: Food does not become radioactive as a result <b>of</b> <b>irradiation.</b> The irradiation process is effective in decreasing or eliminating disease-causing microorganisms such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), campylobacter, and salmonella from foods...|$|R
40|$|The {{radiological}} {{risk for the}} population related to the neutron <b>irradiation</b> <b>of</b> cargo containers with a tagged neutron inspection system has been studied. Two possible effects on the public health have been assessed: the modification of the nutritional and organoleptic properties of the irradiated materials, in particular foodstuff, and the neutron activation of consumer products (i. e. food and pharmaceuticals). The result {{of this study is}} that <b>irradiation</b> <b>of</b> food and <b>foodstuff,</b> pharmaceutical and medical devices in container cargoes would neither modify the properties of the irradiated material nor produce effective doses of concern for public health. Furthermore, the dose received by possible stowaways present inside the container during the inspection is less than the annual effective dose limit defined by European Legislation for the public.

30|$|Irradiation {{technology}} {{has been used for}} decontamination and/or sterilization of dehydrated vegetables, fruits, meats, poultry, fish, and seafood in order to improve product safety and shelf life (Arvanitoyannis et al. 2009; Lacroix and Ouattara 2000). The action <b>of</b> gamma <b>irradiation</b> (GI) on DNA molecules and cell division inhibition is now well understood (Bonura et al. 1975; Le-Tien et al. 2007). Various reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced during the <b>irradiation</b> treatment <b>of</b> <b>foodstuff</b> which contributes to cellular damage (Bonura et al. 1975). Although much literature has reported the mechanism of cinnamon oil and GI on bacteria alone against different bacteria, the combined antimicrobial mechanism of cinnamon oil and GI on S. putrefaciens has not been reported. The aim of the experiments was to evaluate the membrane damage capacity of the combination treatments of cinnamon oil and GI on S. putrefaciens by analyzing the membrane protein and fatty acid profiles as well as the distribution of cinnamaldehyde in S. putrefaciens, thus to analyze the antimicrobial mechanism of the combination treatment against S. putrefaciens.|$|R

40|$|International audienceMany {{scholars}} in China {{have done a}} lot of research on regionalization of agricultural resources in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, but there is no quantitative research on agriculture of the whole plain. By using qualitative and quantitative analysis based on the basic data collected over 300 counties in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, considering such indicators as the natural resources of the plains and the yields of major crops and agricultural GDP,this paper designed the agricultural zoning of the plains. The Plain was classified into high-yield areas and low-producing areas. High-yield areas were divided into advantageous regions <b>of</b> <b>foodstuff,</b> advantageous regions <b>of</b> cotton, advantageous regions of oil, advantageous regions <b>of</b> <b>foodstuff</b> and cotton, advantageous regions <b>of</b> <b>foodstuff</b> and oil, advantageous regions of cotton and oil, and advantageous regions <b>of</b> <b>foodstuff,</b> oil and cotton.
