500|$|Abraham Geiger, {{the founder}} of Reform Judaism, remarked the {{following}} concerning the claim that Jews believed Ezra to be the son of God: “According to the assertion of Muhammad the Jews held Ezra to be the Son of God. This is certainly a mere misunderstanding which arose from the great esteem in which Ezra was undoubtedly held. This esteem is expressed in the following passage ‘Ezra would have been worthy to have made known the law if Moses had not come before him.’ Truly Muhammad sought to cast suspicion on the Jews’ faith in the unity of God, and thought he <b>had</b> <b>here</b> found a good opportunity of so doing.” ...|$|E
500|$|The use of {{a safety}} car to start the race had a mixed {{response}} within the sport. Coulthard agreed with the FIA's decision: [...] "I know {{there will be a}} debate over it but the fact is I was asked beforehand and I said that, based on the previous years we've <b>had</b> <b>here,</b> the safest thing is to have a safety-car start". He added that although the safety-car start eliminated overtaking, it also prevented a major accident. Ralf Schumacher also agreed with the decision to start under safety-car conditions. However, ITV commentator and former driver Martin Brundle felt that the track was not wet enough for a safety car. Journalist Nigel Roebuck said that the length of time under safety-car conditions was inadequate, and raised the possibility of abandoning standing starts. FIA race director Charlie Whiting consulted Coulthard, the drivers' representative, before making his decision.|$|E

Zara Golden of VH1 {{said of the}} video, [...] "The hit is only {{a symbolic}} one, though, and the only real violence to be <b>had</b> <b>here</b> is a slaying guitar riff. Rather, this is an assault against the dubbed-out sound {{that seems to be}} dominating today’s air waves, Green Day’s own and only pretend bloody dubstep demolition." [...] Todd Martens of Los Angeles Times, criticizing the single, said, [...] "It's all played rather straight. 'I'll pick up what's left in the club,' Armstrong sings suspiciously, and the video released Tuesday doesn't do much to present the song as a statement". Alex Young, writing for Consequence of Sound said the opening clips of the band driving motorbikes were irrelevant. Young said, [...] "There’s also a random scene of the band riding dirt bikes through the desert, which doesn't really make sense {{in the context of the}} video but seems like a good way to spend an excess video budget".|$|E
500|$|After {{news of his}} mother's death reaches Luke, the Captain, anticipating that Luke might {{attempt to}} escape in order to attend his mother's funeral, has him locked in the prison {{punishment}} box. After being released from the box, receiving word that his mother's burial is completed and being told to forget about her, Luke is determined to escape. Under {{the cover of a}} Fourth of July celebration, he makes his initial escape attempt. He is later recaptured by local police and returned to the chain gang, but not before one of the bloodhounds sent after him dies from strain caused by struggling through barbed-wire fences. After his capture and return, the Captain has Luke fitted with leg-irons and delivers a warning speech to the other inmates, explaining, [...] "What we've got here is failure to communicate.

500|$|Mirkin {{directed}} the feature film Romy and Michele's High School Reunion in 1997. The film stars Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow as two friends determined {{to show their}} former high school tormentors at their 10-year reunion that they have led successful lives. Mirkin said of the film: [...] "These are women characters we haven't seen before. There are so few female buddy movies, written funny for women. Women don't get to do odd, strange, self-involved roles like these." [...] He knew Kudrow previously and felt she was [...] "perfect" [...] for the role, but did not expect Sorvino would take the part given her recent Academy Award win for Mighty Aphrodite, but it [...] "turn out that she'd had a horrible time in high school, so the story appealed to her". The film received critical praise, as did Mirkin's direction. James Berardinelli wrote that Mirkin [...] "brings {{a lot of energy}} to the production, always keeping things moving", while Jack Matthews of The Los Angeles Times says Mirkin [...] "knew exactly what he <b>had</b> <b>here</b> and composed it like frames in a comic strip, ordering cheerful snow-cone colors for everything from the girls' childlike outfits to the decor of a Laundromat".|$|E

500|$|Imperial Bedrooms {{opens with}} an {{acknowledgement}} from Clay, the main character, {{that both the}} Less Than Zero novel and its film adaption are actual representational works within the narrative of his life: [...] "The movie {{was based on a}} book by someone we knew... It was labeled fiction but only a few details had been altered and our names weren't changed and there was nothing in it that hadn't happened." [...] The Los Angeles Times described this as a [...] "nifty little trick", as it allows Ellis to establish the newer book [...] "as the primary narrative, one that trumps Ellis as author and the real world." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle calls it a [...] "neat trick of authorial self-abnegation". Another reviewer describes it as Ellis at [...] "his most ambitious", a [...] "Philip Rothian, doppelgänger gambit", making his new narrator [...] "the real Clay" [...] and the other an imposter. This allows Ellis to skilfully, [...] "with writerly jujitsu", acknowledge Robert Downey Jr.'s popular performance as Julian in the moralistic 1987 film, in which he died; Ellis appreciates the adaptation as a [...] "milestone in a lot of ways". The device also allows the novelist to insert self-critique; The Sunday Times reviewer notes that Imperial Bedrooms finds its characters [...] "still a little sore at their depiction as inarticulate zombies". John Crace, in his [...] "digested read" [...] of Imperial Bedrooms, insinuates through parody that [...] "the author" [...] of the metafictional Less Than Zero is also meant to be Ellis, describing him in Clay's voice as [...] "too immersed in the passivity of writing and too pleased with his own style to bother with many commas to admit it so he wrote me into the story as the man who was too frightened to love." [...] With regard to the opening narrative conceit, Ellis queries [...] "Is it complication ... or is it clarification?", opining that it certainly is the latter for Clay. Even though Ellis never names himself explicitly in the book, he conceded to Lawson that one can [...] "guess [...] is who the Clay of Imperial Bedrooms is referring to." [...] Ellis did, however, reveal that he had not decided when writing the novel whether Clay was referring to him or not. Eileen Battersby likened Bedrooms to Lunar Park (2005), cited his use of [...] "self-consciousness as a device." [...] This device was picked up on by several other critics—in particular, Vice noted that [...] "the scatological violence of American Psycho" [...] and [...] "the otherworldly terror of Lunar Park" [...] <b>had</b> <b>here</b> been combined. Ellis himself raised the [...] "sequel" [...] question, commenting [...] "...I don't think it is [...] Well, I mean, it is and it isn't. It's narrated by him, sure. But I guess I could maybe have switched the names around and it could stand alone." ...|$|E

According to the Suda, a Byzantine encyclopedic compilation, before the city became known as Aphrodisias (c.3rd century BCE) it had three {{previous}} names: Lelégōn Pólis (Λελέγων πόλις, [...] "City of the Leleges"), Megálē Pólis (Μεγάλη Πόλις, [...] "Great City"), and Ninóē (Νινόη).|$|E

[...] And, [...] "the last end cannot consist in the active life, which pertains to the practical intellect." [...] So: [...] "Therefore the last and perfect happiness, which we await in the life to come, consists entirely in contemplation. But imperfect happiness, such as can be <b>had</b> <b>here,</b> consists first and principally in contemplation, but secondarily, in an operation of the practical intellect directing human actions and passions." ...|$|E

Breaking recent—and unsuccessful—tradition, Caine also said [...] "the successor will not come from the current staff ...

2500|$|In late September 2003, McNabb was {{the subject}} of very {{controversial}} comments made by Rush Limbaugh, who worked as a commentator for ESPN at the time, stating that McNabb was overrated and that, [...] "I think what we’ve <b>had</b> <b>here</b> is a little social concern in the NFL. The media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well". The comments came after the Eagles began the season 0–2, losing to defending Super Bowl champion Buccaneers and eventual champion New England, both losses coming in their newly opened stadium, Lincoln Financial Field. There had been much discussion about the merit of these comments, which resulted in Limbaugh's resignation from ESPN. Football writer Allen Barra argued that Limbaugh's comments were in line with McNabb's statistical performance at the time.|$|E

2500|$|After stumps, with Australia at 4/254, Ponting {{was happy}} with his performance, [...] "I'm as pleased with that innings as I {{probably}} have been with any innings I've ever played," [...] he said.

[...] I've been working really hard," [...] Ponting said on his technique. [...] "I've {{made no secret of}} it, my record here has been poor. Today is one step in the right direction. It was nice to get some runs out there and put the team in a good position. But one innings doesn't make a tour. The other tours I've <b>had</b> <b>here,</b> apart from the last Test I played, I've batted at six, always coming in against spin and when the wicket has worn.
