25|$|The Indian medical {{practitioner}} Upendra Nath Brahmachari {{was nominated for}} the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1929 for his discovery of ureastibamine (an antimonial compound {{for the treatment of}} <b>kala-azar)</b> and a new disease, post <b>kala-azar</b> dermal leishmaniasis. Brahmachari's cure for visceral leishmaniasis was the urea salt of para-amino-phenyl stibnic acid which he called Urea Stibamine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kala-azar</b> {{first came}} to the {{attention}} of Western doctors in 1824 in Jessore, India (now Bangladesh), where it was initially thought to be a form of malaria. Assam gave <b>kala-azar</b> one of its common names, Assam fever. Another common name, <b>kala-azar</b> (Hindustani: काला आज़ार (Devanagari) کالا آزار (Nastaleeq) kālā āzār), is derived from kala which means black in Sanskrit, as well as in the languages descended from it, including Assamese, Hindi and Urdu; the word azar means Fever in Persian and Hindustani; as such the disease is named for the darkening of the skin on the extremities and abdomen that is a symptom of the Indian form of the disease. The agent of the disease was also first isolated in India by Scottish doctor William Leishman (who observed the parasite in spleen smears of a soldier who died of the disease in Dumdum, Calcutta, India - hence the name dumdum fever) and Irish physician Charles Donovan, working independently of each other. As they published their discovery almost simultaneously, the species was named for both of them—Leishmania donovani.|$|E
25|$|Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} or <b>kala-azar</b> ('black fever') is {{the most}} serious form, and is potentially fatal if untreated. Other consequences, which can occur a few months to years after infection, include fever, damage to the spleen and liver, and anemia.|$|E
25|$|Since 1979, MSF {{has been}} {{providing}} medical humanitarian assistance in Sudan, a nation plagued by starvation {{and the civil}} war, prevalent malnutrition {{and one of the}} highest maternal mortality rates in the world. In March 2009, it is reported that MSF has employed 4590 field staff in Sudan tackling issues such as armed conflicts, epidemic diseases, health care and social exclusion. MSF’s continued presence and work in Sudan is one of the organization’s largest interventions. MSF provides a range of health care services including nutritional support, reproductive healthcare, <b>Kala-Azar</b> treatment, counselling services and surgery to the people living in Sudan. Common diseases prevalent in Sudan include tuberculosis, <b>kala-azar</b> also known as visceral leishmaniasis, meningitis, measles, cholera, and malaria.|$|E
25|$|Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} (VL), {{also known}} as <b>kala-azar,</b> black fever, and Dumdum fever, is the most severe form of leishmaniasis and, without proper diagnosis and treatment, is associated with high fatality. Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus.|$|E
25|$|Post-kala-azar dermal {{leishmaniasis}} (PKDL) is {{a recurrence}} of <b>kala-azar</b> that may appear on the skin of affected individuals months and up to 20 years after being partially treated, untreated or even in those considered adequately treated. In Sudan, they can be demonstrated in up to 60% of treated cases. They manifest as hypopigmented skin lesions (such as macules, papules, nodules), or facial redness. Though any organism causing <b>kala-azar</b> can lead to PKDL, it is commonly associated with Leishmania donovani which gives different disease patterns in India and Sudan. In the Indian variant, nodules enlarge with time and form plaques but rarely ulcerate, but nodules from the African variety often ulcerate as they progress. Nerve involvement is common in African variety but rare in Indian subcontinent. Histology demonstrates a mixture of chronic inflammatory cells; there can be macrophage or epitheloid granuloma. Parasite concentration is not consistent among studies, perhaps reflecting low sensitivity of diagnostic methods used in earlier entries.|$|E
25|$|When people develop visceral leishmaniasis, {{the most}} typical {{symptoms}} are fever and the {{enlargement of the}} spleen, with enlargement of the liver sometimes being seen as well. The blackening of the skin that gave the disease its common name in India {{does not appear in}} most strains of the disease, and the other symptoms are very easy to mistake for those of malaria. Misdiagnosis is dangerous, as without proper treatment the mortality rate for <b>kala-azar</b> is close to 100%. L. donovani itself is not usually the direct cause of death in <b>kala-azar</b> sufferers, however. Pneumonia, tuberculosis, and dysentery are omnipresent in the depressed regions where leishmaniasis thrives, and, as with AIDS, it is these opportunistic infections that are more likely to kill, flaring up in a host whose immune system has been weakened by the L. donovani infection. Progress of the disease is extremely variable, taking anywhere from one to twenty weeks, but a typical duration for the Sudanese strain of the disease is narrower, between twelve and sixteen weeks.|$|E
25|$|The Bengal famine of 1943-44 (Bengali: Pañcāśēra manwantara) {{was a major}} {{famine in}} the Bengal {{province}} in British India during World War II. An estimated 2.1million {{people died in the}} famine, the deaths occurring first from starvation and then from diseases, which included cholera, malaria, smallpox, dysentery, and <b>kala-azar.</b> Other factors, such as malnutrition, population displacement, unsanitary conditions, and lack of health care, further increased disease fatalities. Millions were impoverished as the crisis overwhelmed large segments of the economy and social fabric, accelerating a trend toward economic inequality.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the name}} <b>kala-azar</b> is used interchangeably with the {{scientific}} name visceral leishmaniasis {{for the most}} acute form of the disease caused by L. donovani. The disease is endemic in West Bengal, where it was first discovered, but is seen at its most deadly in north and east Africa. It {{can also be found}} throughout the Arab world and southern Europe (where the causative organism is L. infantum), and a slightly different strain of the pathogen, L. chagasi, is responsible for leishmaniasis in the new world. Several species of canines serve as reservoir hosts of L. infantum (chagasi).|$|E
25|$|Malaria was {{the biggest}} killer. From July 1943 through June 1944, the monthly death toll from malaria stood {{at an average of}} 125% over rates from the {{previous}} five years; in December 1943, the excess mortality was 203% over average. Malaria parasites were found in nearly 40% of all blood samples examined at Calcutta hospitals in 1943 during the peak period, November and December, and in nearly 52% in the same period in 1944. Moreover, since its symptoms often resemble those of other fatal fevers (such as <b>kala-azar)</b> and since only a small proportion of victims received medical care and were examined, statistics for malaria deaths are almost certainly underestimated.|$|E
25|$|Leishmania donovani is {{a species}} of {{intracellular}} parasites belonging to the genus Leishmania, a group of haemoflagellate kinetoplastids that cause the disease leishmaniasis. It is a human blood parasite responsible for visceral leishmaniasis or <b>kala-azar,</b> the most severe form of leishmaniasis. It infects the mononuclear phagocyte system including spleen, liver and bone marrow. Infection is transmitted by species of sandfly belonging to the genus Phlebotomus in Old World and Lutzomyia in New World. Therefore, the parasite is prevalent throughout tropical and temperate regions including Africa (mostly in Sudan), China, India, Nepal, southern Europe, Russia and South America. It is responsible for thousands of deaths every year and has spread to 88 countries, with 350 million people at constant risk of infection and 0.5 million new cases in a year.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Kala-azar,</b> {{also known}} as visceral leishmaniasis, {{has been one of}} the major health {{problems}} in Sudan. After the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between North and Southern Sudan on 9 January 2005, the increase in stability within the region helped further efforts in healthcare delivery. Médicins sans Frontières tested a combination of sodium stibogluconate and paromomycin, which would reduce treatment duration (from 30 to 17 days) and cost in 2008. In March 2010, MSF set up its first <b>Kala-Azar</b> treatment centre in Eastern Sudan, providing free treatment for this otherwise deadly disease. If left untreated, there is a fatality rate of 99% within 1–4 months of infection. Since the treatment centre was set up, MSF has cured more than 27,000 <b>Kala-Azar</b> patients with a success rate of approximately 90–95%. There are plans to open an additional <b>Kala-Azar</b> treatment centre in Malakal, Southern Sudan to cope with the overwhelming number of patients that are seeking treatment. MSF has been providing necessary medical supplies to hospitals and training Sudanese health professionals to help them deal with <b>Kala-Azar.</b> MSF, Sudanese Ministry of Health and other national and international institutions are combining efforts to improve on the treatment and diagnosis of <b>Kala-Azar.</b> Research on its cures and vaccines are currently being conducted. [...] In December 2010, South Sudan was hit with the worst outbreak of <b>Kala-Azar</b> in eight years.|$|E
2500|$|Even with recovery, <b>kala-azar</b> {{does not}} always leave its hosts unmarked. Some time after {{successful}} treatment—generally a few months with African <b>kala-azar,</b> or as much as several years with the Indian strain—a secondary form of the disease may set in, called post <b>kala-azar</b> dermal leishmaniasis, or PKDL. This condition manifests first as small, measle-like skin lesions on the face, which gradually increase in size and spread over the body. Eventually the lesions may coalesce to form disfiguring, swollen structures resembling leprosy, and occasionally causing blindness if they spread to the eyes. (This disease {{is not the same}} as cutaneous leishmaniasis, a milder disease caused by another protozoan of the Leishmania genus which also causes skin lesions.) ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{remains unclear}} who first {{discovered}} the organism. David Douglas Cunningham, Surgeon Major of the British Indian army, {{may have seen}} it in 1885 {{without being able to}} relate it to the disease. Peter Borovsky, a Russian military surgeon working in Tashkent, conducted research into the etiology of [...] "oriental sore", locally known as sart sore, and in 1898 published the first accurate description of the causative agent, correctly described the parasite's relation to host tissues and correctly referred it to the protozoa. However, because his results were published in Russian in a journal with low circulation, his results were not internationally acknowledged during his lifetime. In 1901, Leishman identified certain organisms in smears taken from the spleen of a patient who had died from [...] "dum-dum fever" [...] (Dum Dum is an area close to Calcutta) and proposed them to be trypanosomes, found {{for the first time in}} India. A few months later, Captain Charles Donovan (1863–1951) confirmed the finding of what became known as Leishman-Donovan bodies in smears taken from people in Madras in southern India. [...] But it was Ronald Ross who proposed that Leishman-Donovan bodies were the intracellular stages of a new parasite, which he named Leishmania donovani. The link with the disease <b>kala-azar</b> was first suggested by Charles Donovan, and was conclusively demonstrated by Charles Bentley's discovery of L. donovani in patients with <b>kala-azar.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Contemporary {{life has}} made itself felt even here, however—not as [...] "progress" [...] {{but in the}} form of the many small wars of Africa's post-colonial era. In the Sudan, where civil war has been {{continuous}} since 1983, the violence has been concentrated in the more populated south, and <b>kala-azar</b> was concentrated there too. But the wars have driven a steady stream of refugees out of the region, and these traveled either across the southern border or into the remoter western part of the country called the Upper Nile, where both war and the disease that went with it had not yet penetrated.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} known epidemics of L. donovani infection (<b>kala-azar</b> {{as it was called}} in Hindi) was known in India just after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The first medical record was however only in 1870 by British medical officers from Assam. In 1900, an English soldier stationed at Dum Dum, West Bengal, died at the Army Medical School in Netley, England. The autopsy was performed by William Boog Leishman. He processed the tissue sample of the enlarged spleen using a staining technique (now known as Leishman's stain) which he had just developed, and discovered the protozoan parasites using microscopy. But he mistakenly considered the parasites to be degenerate trypanosomes, already known protozoan parasites in Africa and South America. In 1903, Leishman published his discovery of [...] "trypanosomes in India" [...] in the British Medical Journal, which appeared on 11 May. Another British medical officer Charles Donovan, who was serving in the Indian Medical Service, had found the parasites in April of that year at the Government General Hospital in Madras. After reading Leishman paper, Donovan confirmed on 17 June that the parasites (by then known as [...] "Leishman bodies") were definitely the causative agents of <b>kala-azar.</b> He wrote a commentary of his discovery in relation to that of Leishman in the same journal, that appeared on 11 July 1903. Soon a controversy arose as to whom such a monumental discovery should be credited. Donovan sent some of his slides to Ronald Ross, who was at the time in Liverpool, and to Alphonse Laveran at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Laveran and his colleague Félix Mesnil identified the protozoan (and yet wrongly) to be members of Piroplasmida, and gave the scientific name Piroplasma donovanii. It was Ross who resolved the conflict of priority in the discovery and correctly identified the species as member of the novel genus Leishmania. He gave the popular name [...] "Leishman-Donovan bodies", and subsequently the valid binomial Leishmania donovani, thereby equally crediting the two rivals.|$|E
2500|$|These refugees, {{moving at}} foot-speed, carried the disease with them, {{and when it}} arrived it hit the Upper Nile with a force {{comparable}} to smallpox hitting the American Indians. The isolated people of the Upper Nile had no access to medicine or education about the new disease among them. Worse, their immune systems were defenseless against this new pathogen, foreign to them though it came only from another part of their own country. One village {{at the center of}} the epidemic, Duar, was left with four survivors out of a population of a thousand, and from the late eighties to the mid-nineties a total of 100,000 succumbed to the sickness in that region alone. In the words of Jill Seaman, the doctor who led relief efforts in the Upper Nile for the French organization Médecins Sans Frontières, [...] "Where else in the world could 50% of a population die without anyone knowing?" [...] Due to the South Sudanese Civil War, <b>kala-azar</b> has spread rapidly among the population.|$|E
2500|$|Descriptions of {{conspicuous}} lesions {{similar to}} cutaneous leishmaniasis appear on tablets from King Ashurbanipal from {{the seventh century}} BCE, {{some of which may}} have derived from even earlier texts from 1500 to 2500 BCE. Persian physicians, including Avicenna in the 10th century CE, gave detailed descriptions of what was called balkh sore. [...] In 1756, Alexander Russell, after examining a Turkish patient, gave one of the most detailed clinical descriptions of the disease. Physicians in the Indian subcontinent would describe it as <b>kala-azar</b> (pronounced kālā āzār, the Urdu, Hindi, and Hindustani phrase for [...] "black fever", kālā meaning black and āzār meaning fever or disease). In the Americas, evidence of the cutaneous form of the disease in Ecuador and Peru appears in pre-Inca pottery depicting skin lesions and deformed faces dating back to the first century CE. Some 15th- and 16th-century texts from the Inca period and from Spanish colonials mention [...] "valley sickness", [...] "Andean sickness", or [...] "white leprosy", which are likely to be the cutaneous form.|$|E
2500|$|L. donovani is the causative {{agent of}} visceral leishmaniasis, {{traditionally}} known as <b>kala-azar</b> ("black fever", particularly in India), {{because of its}} characteristic symptoms. The disease is highly lethal if not treated properly. The incubation period generally ranges from 3 to 6 months, {{and in some cases}} may be over a year. In Indian leishmaniasis, incubation can be as short as 10 days. The target cells are those of mononuclear phagocyte system. The two main tissues of infection are spleen and liver. Clinical symptoms include pyrexia (recurring high fever which may be continuous or remittent), enlargement of spleen and liver, and heavy skin pigmentation which darkens the physical appearance (the reason for naming [...] "black fever"). To a lesser extent mucosa of the small intestine and lymph nodes are also invaded by the parasite. Morphological symptoms are noticeable particularly on facial and abdominal regions. Skin becomes coarse and hard. In African infections, warty eruptions are common. In a fully developed stage, the patient shows emaciation and anaemia. Where medical facilities are poor, mortality can be as high as 75–95% within 2 years of epidemics. The disease is often accompanied by complications with dysentery, tuberculosis, septicaemia and even HIV infection.|$|E
