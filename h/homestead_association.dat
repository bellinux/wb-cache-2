500|$|Carson's birthplace and {{childhood}} home in Springdale, Pennsylvania—now {{known as the}} Rachel Carson Homestead—became a National Register of Historic Places site, and the nonprofit Rachel Carson <b>Homestead</b> <b>Association</b> was created in 1975 to manage it. Her home in Colesville, Maryland where she wrote Silent Spring was named a National Historic Landmark in 1991. Near Pittsburgh, a [...] hiking trail, called the Rachel Carson Trail and maintained by the Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy, was dedicated to Carson in 1975. A Pittsburgh bridge was also renamed in Carson's honor as the Rachel Carson Bridge. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection State Office Building in Harrisburg is named in her honor. Elementary schools in Gaithersburg, Montgomery County, Maryland, Sammamish, Washington and San Jose, California were named in her honor, as were middle schools in Beaverton, Oregon and Herndon, Virginia (Rachel Carson Middle School), and {{a high school in}} Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
500|$|... 2007 was {{the centennial}} of Carson's birth. On Earth Day (April 22, 2007), Courage for the Earth: Writers, Scientists, and Activists Celebrate the Life and Writing of Rachel Carson was {{released}} as [...] "a centennial appreciation of Rachel Carson's brave life and transformative writing." [...] It contained thirteen essays by environmental writers and scientists. Democratic Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland had intended to submit a resolution celebrating Carson for her [...] "legacy of scientific rigor coupled with poetic sensibility" [...] on the 100th anniversary of her birth. The resolution was blocked by Republican Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who said that [...] "The junk science and stigma surrounding DDT—the cheapest and most effective insecticide on the planet—have finally been jettisoned." [...] The Rachel Carson <b>Homestead</b> <b>Association</b> held a May 27 birthday party and sustainable feast at her birthplace and home in Springdale, Pennsylvania, and the first Rachel Carson Legacy Conference in Pittsburgh with E. O. Wilson as keynote speaker. Both Rachel's Sustainable Feast and the conference continue as annual events.|$|E

[...] But first, they needed to secure the College's water rights by buying a large farm to the east. [...] In 1864, they organized the College <b>Homestead</b> <b>Association,</b> which borrowed $35,000 to purchase the land, plus another $33,000 to purchase 160 acres (650,000 m²) of land to the south of the future campus. The Association subdivided the latter parcel and started selling lots with the hope it could raise enough money to repay its lenders and also create a new college town. [...] But sales of new homesteads fell short.|$|E

2500|$|Eulogio de Celis {{had tried}} to sell his vast {{holdings}} in the Valley, but found no buyers. Squeezed by debt after the flood years, Andrés Pico had sold his half-interest in the Rancho ex-Mission San Fernando to his brother Pío Pico in 1862, retaining [...] called the Pico Reserve around the old Mission. [...] When De Celis died in 1869, Pío Pico, desperately in need of cash, sold his half-share {{to a group of}} investors assembled as the San Fernando Farm <b>Homestead</b> <b>Association.</b> The leading investor was Isaac Lankershim, a Northern California stockman and grain farmer, who was impressed by the Valley's wild oats and proposed to raise sheep on the property. Other investors included Levi Strauss. To complete the sale, the Valley was split lengthwise, with the Association purchasing the southern half and the northern half devolving to De Celis's heirs. The line of demarcation was a ploughed furrow across the Valley floor near the route of today's Roscoe Boulevard. In 1873, Isaac Lankershim's son and future son-in-law, James Boon Lankershim and Isaac Newton Van Nuys, moved to the Valley and took over management of the property. Van Nuys built the first wood-frame house in the Valley. Initially, the two men raised sheep, changing the name of the company to the San Fernando Sheep Company. Van Nuys, however, thought the property could profitably grow wheat using the dryland farming technique developed on the Great Plains, and leased land from the Association to test his theories. After a drought destroyed the majority of the sheep in 1875, the remainder of the property was given over to raising wheat and barley. In time, the Lankershim property, under its third name, the Los Angeles Farming and Milling Company, would become the world's largest wheat-growing empire.|$|E

50|$|In 1854, Horner {{purchased}} {{a portion of}} the Rancho San Miguel from José de Jesús Noé, in what is called the western Mission District of San Francisco and parts of Noe Valley. By the 1860s <b>Homestead</b> <b>associations</b> were popular in San Francisco as a way for persons of modest means to pool their money and purchase large tracts of land to be subdivided, and for early speculators to acquire groups of lots and even entire blocks for later development. Horner platted his lands (in what is now the Mission District) as blocks and lots, named his new streets based on personal and religious influences, and advertised residential property for sale in Horner's Addition. However very few of his lots sold, due to the hilly terrain, poor access, and economic downturns. Horner lost his entire fortune in the panic of 1857 and was forced to liquidate his land holdings.|$|R

30|$|The endemic {{multiple}} use tree species Millettia ferruginea (Hochst.) Baker, is widely grown in southeastern, northern, central, southwestern, and the northwestern highlands of Ethiopia at altitudes ranging from 1000 to 2800  m. This tree species is commonly retained on farmlands and <b>homesteads</b> in <b>association</b> with annual and perennial crops {{as well as}} on homesteads and as shade tree of coffee (Tadesse 1998; Hailu et al. 2000). Delonix regia (Bojer ex Hook.) is also widely grown in Ethiopia, commonly at roadsides and for ornamental purposes.

40|$|The Homestead Neighborhood {{is located}} in {{southwest}} Portland. It was first studied {{as part of the}} Marquam Hill Plan in 1977. Since that time two major health providers, the Shriners and the Veterans Administration,have built new facilities on the hill. The Oregon Health Sciences University is now poised and ready for major expansion of its medical schools, hospital and research facilities. Meanwhile, area residents and property owners, have voiced concerns about increased traffic, and building density. Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU) contracted with the School of Urban and Public Affairs at Portland State University to draft a comprehensive neighborhood plan, to supplement its own long rang planning on Marquam Hill. Graduate students in the Masters in Urban Planning (MUP) program, under the direction of Michael S. Harrison AICP, Chief Planner for the City of Portland, prepared this plan over a ten week time period. This plan will also be presented to the <b>Homestead</b> Neighborhood <b>Association</b> to provide a basis for further studies. The recommendations presented in the following section, are solely those {{of the students in the}} USP 528 Comprehensive Planning Workshop. As presented here, they represent many rounds of in-class discussion, fieldwork and input from residents. The Advisory Committee contributed review and advice. The document makes reference to several sites. The 2 ̆ 2 medical complex 2 ̆ 2 is considered the Oregon Health Sciences University, the Shriners Hospital and the Veterans Administration Hospital. The 2 ̆ 2 campus 2 ̆ 2 refers to the same area as the medical complex. The 2 ̆ 2 Homestead Plat 2 ̆ 2 refers to the residential and commercial area just west of the campus up to SW 14 thStreet. The Homestead neighborhood is a political jurisdiction recognized by the City of Portland which surrounds the areas platted as Homestead on Marquam Hill, but also embraces parts of Portland Heights and the Hillsdale area. Marquam Hill is a geographical term which relates to a much wider area than just the Homestead neighborhood. The background section covers the history, characteristics and patterns of land use in the Homestead Neighborhood. It provides a factual basis for determining alternatives,making recommendations and establishing policy. It also may be used as a general reference. The background is organized into seven sections: historical perspective; sumary of planning activities; overview of transportation patterns; analysis of development and infrastructure; discussions of amenities and topography; and an overview of demographics. A comprehensive property inventory detailing individual parcel ownership and physical characteristics has also been compiled and included as an addenda to this report. The fourth section of the report describes and analyzes the planning methodology used to research this project. Property data was collected and tabulated using Multnomah County records which were then checked and enhanced through field observation. Citizen participation was fostered by impanelling an advisory committee consisting of neighborhood representatives of the neighborhood, medical complex and the City Park Bureau, conducting a workshop with the neighborhood and distributing surveys to all residences. The findings of the class are presented in the final section of this report. The findings and recommendations contained in this report are solely those of the class and do not necessarily represent the policies of the City of Portland, Portland State University, Oregon Health Sciences University or the <b>Homestead</b> Neighborhood <b>Association.</b> The report will hopefully foster communication between the <b>Homestead</b> Neighborhood <b>Association,</b> the medical complex and the City of Portland. This is not intended as a final plan but rather as a starting point for further discussion. The next step in this planning process is for the Neighborhood and University to continue a dialog to formulate the goals and objectives of a neighborhood plan. A series of public discussions would follow to determine the contents of the final document. The final step would be to get the plan ratified by the Portland City Council...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Sleeping {{sickness}} (HAT) {{caused by}} T. b. rhodesiense {{is a major}} veterinary and human public health problem in Uganda. Previous studies have investigated spatial risk factors for T. b. rhodesiense at large geographic scales, but none have properly investigated such risk factors at small scales, i. e. within affected villages. In the present work, we use a case-control methodology to analyse both behavioural and spatial risk factors for HAT in an endemic area. Methods The present study investigates behavioural and occupational risk factors for infection with HAT within villages using a questionnaire-based case-control study conducted in 17 villages endemic for HAT in SE Uganda, and spatial risk factors in 4 high risk villages. For the spatial analysis, the location of homesteads {{with one or more}} cases of HAT up to three years prior {{to the beginning of the}} study was compared to all non-case <b>homesteads.</b> Analysing spatial <b>associations</b> with respect to irregularly shaped geographical objects required the development of a new approach to geographical analysis in combination with a logistic regression model. Results The study was able to identify, among other behavioural risk factors, having a family member with a history of HAT (p = 0. 001) as well as proximity of a homestead to a nearby wetland area (p Conclusion Spatial risk factors for HAT are maintained across geographical scales; this consistency is useful in the design of decision support tools for intervention and prevention of the disease. Familial aggregation of cases was confirmed for T. b. rhodesiense HAT in the study and probably results from shared behavioural and spatial risk factors amongmembers of a household. </p...|$|R
