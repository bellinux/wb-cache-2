5|$|The {{committee}} {{found that}} the CMF was a hollow shell of its former self, depleted in numbers and in equipment and unable to adequately fulfil its tasks. However, it still {{found that the}}re was a role for the CMF to play in the strategic environment that existed at the time, although it would no longer be called upon to provide the base upon which mobilisation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> would be built, instead it would be used to augment the Regular Army. This was the first step in creating the concept of a total force, in which the differing virtues of the citizen soldier and the regular soldier would be used to complement each other, and in this vein the Millar Report recommended that the name be changed from the CMF to the Australian Army Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, Bush issued an {{executive}} order authorizing the President's Surveillance Program which included allowing the NSA to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant {{as required by the}} Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. As of 2009, the other provisions of the program remained highly classified. Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists. The program proved to be controversial, as critics of the administration, as well as organizations such as the American Bar Association, argued that it was illegal. In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional, but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit {{on the grounds that the}} plaintiffs lacked standing. On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight. Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to as PRISM, that was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post and The Guardian emerged in June 2013.|$|E

500|$|During {{the last}} years of her reign, Elizabeth came to rely on the {{granting}} of monopolies as a cost-free system of patronage, rather than asking Parliament for more subsidies <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> The practice soon led to price-fixing, the enrichment of courtiers at the public's expense, and widespread resentment.

500|$|After {{efforts to}} prevent the Civil War ended with the firing on Fort Sumter, Northern Democrats, {{including}} Douglas, endorsed Lincoln's plan to bring the Southern states back into the fold by force. Pierce wanted to avoid war at all costs, and wrote to Van Buren, proposing an assembly of former U.S. presidents to resolve the issue, but this suggestion was not acted on. [...] "I will never justify, sustain or in any way or to any extent uphold this cruel, heartless, aimless, unnecessary war," [...] Pierce wrote to his wife. Pierce publicly opposed President Lincoln's order suspending the writ of habeas corpus, arguing that even <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> the country should not abandon its protection of civil liberties.

500|$|Third in {{seniority}} in the RAAF after Air Marshal Richard Williams and Air Vice Marshal Stanley Goble, and considered, in {{the words}} of historian Chris Coulthard-Clark, to be [...] "among the Air Force's best brains" [...] at the time, Bostock was a prime candidate for the position of CAS in May 1942. He was also first choice of the incumbent CAS, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, whose two-year term was coming to an end. However, Bostock's closeness to Burnett, who had made no secret of his contempt for John Curtin's Federal Labor government, damaged his chances for selection and his friend, George Jones, then only a substantive wing commander and acting air commodore, took the position. Although he had expected to be made CAS, Bostock warmly congratulated Jones, possibly expecting that his (Bostock's) new role as chief of staff to the Commander of Allied Air Forces, Lieutenant General George Brett, with responsibility for air operations in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), would prove the more important appointment <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Civil War brought {{economic}} disturbances {{which resulted}} in the removal of some coins, including the base-metal cent, from circulation. [...] Paper currency (valued as low as three cents), postage stamps, and private tokens, filled the gap. [...] Many of the tokens were cent-sized, but thinner and made of bronze. Mint authorities took notice that these metal pieces were successfully circulating, and obtained legislation for a bronze cent. [...] Longacre's Indian head design continued in its place with the new metal; later in 1864 he engraved his initial [...] "L" [...] in the headdress. [...] The act which authorized the bronze cent also issued a two-cent piece; Longacre furnished a design, which Lange calls a [...] "particularly attractive composition" [...] with arrows and a laurel wreath flanking a shield. [...] However, art historian Cornelius Vermeule stated that elements of the design [...] "need only flanking cannon to be the consummate expressions of Civil War heraldry." [...] Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase favored placing an expression of the nation's faith in God <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> on the coinage, and wrote to Mint Director Pollock, [...] "You will cause a device to be prepared without unnecessary delay with a motto expressing in the fewest tersest terms possible this national recognition."
