5|$|Several {{antiviral}} {{drugs are}} effective for treating herpes, including acyclovir, valaciclovir (valacyclovir), <b>famciclovir,</b> and penciclovir. Acyclovir {{was the first}} discovered and is now available in generic. Valacyclovir is also available as a generic and is slightly more effective than aciclovir for reducing lesion healing time.|$|E
5|$|A {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} test on a blood sample from affected animals will confirm a suspected case by identifying the viral DNA, though it is now common to start <b>famciclovir</b> treatment at the earliest possible moment rather than waiting for confirmation of the case. Prior {{to the development of}} the test, or in circumstances where it is not available, the disease may be misdiagnosed as any of a number of other conditions which have a quick onset leading to rapid death, including encephalomyocarditis and salmonellosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{virus has}} been {{identified}} in the pulmonary nodules of African elephants {{as far back as}} the 1970s. The first recognised fatal case of EEHV in an Asian elephant was identified at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., in 1995; testing on stored tissue samples was able to identify a number of earlier deaths as being due to the same virus. These cases have so far been identified as early as 1983. Since this date, there have been a total of 54 more cases in North America and Europe, nine of which were successfully treated. The May 2009 deaths of two calves at Whipsnade Zoo were not included in this calculation. This gives a fatality rate of over 80% among known symptomatic disease cases. In cases where antiviral medication was applied, treatment was effective in about one in three cases. As of 2005, there were twelve cases where <b>famciclovir</b> had been used, eight of which were fatal. As a fraction of the overall population, it has been calculated that of the 78 Asian elephants born in captivity in North America between 1978 and 2007, 19 are known to have died of EEHV, and five more were successfully treated with antiviral medication.|$|E

2500|$|Antibiotics are {{commonly}} used to prevent secondary bacterial infection. [...] There are no specific antiviral drugs in common use at this time for FVR, although one study has shown that ganciclovir, PMEDAP, and cidofovir hold promise for treatment. More recent {{research has indicated that}} systemic <b>famciclovir</b> is effective at treating this infection in cats without the side effects reported with other anti-viral agents. [...] More severe cases may require supportive care such as intravenous fluid therapy, oxygen therapy, or even a feeding tube. [...] Conjunctivitis and corneal ulcers are treated with topical antibiotics for secondary bacterial infection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Famciclovir</b> was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in 1994. On August 24, 2007, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the first generic version of <b>famciclovir.</b> Generic tablets are manufactured by TEVA Pharmaceuticals and Mylan Pharmaceuticals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Famciclovir</b> is a {{guanosine}} analogue {{antiviral drug}} {{used for the}} treatment of various herpesvirus infections, most commonly for herpes zoster (shingles).

50|$|Several {{studies in}} humans and mice provide {{evidence}} that early treatment with <b>famciclovir</b> soon after the first infection with herpes can significantly lower the chance of future outbreaks. Use of <b>famciclovir</b> in this manner {{has been shown to}} reduce the amount of latent virus in the neural ganglia compared to no treatment or treatment with valaciclovir. A review of human subjects treated for five days with <b>famciclovir</b> 250 mg three times daily during their first herpes episode found that only 4.2 percent experienced a recurrence within six months after the first outbreak, a fivefold decrease compared to the 19 percent recurrence in acyclovir-treated patients. Neither drug affected latency if treatment was delayed for several months.|$|E

5000|$|Antiviral agents, such as <b>famciclovir,</b> {{are given}} {{at the onset of}} attacks of herpes zoster to shorten the {{clinical}} course and to help prevent complications such as postherpetic neuralgia.

5000|$|Effective {{antiviral}} medications include acyclovir and penciclovir, {{which can}} speed healing {{by as much}} as 10%. [...] <b>Famciclovir</b> or valacyclovir, taken in pill form, can be effective using a single day, high-dose application and is more cost effective and convenient than the traditional treatment of lower doses for 5-7 days.|$|E
50|$|<b>Famciclovir</b> is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of herpes zoster (shingles), treatment of herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), herpes labialis (cold sores) in immunocompetent patients and for the suppression of recurring episodes of herpes simplex virus 2.

50|$|Currently {{treatment}} of ARN consists of antiviral therapy administered orally. Typical antiviral agents used include <b>famciclovir,</b> valganciclovir, and valacyclovir. While on these medications, a patient's kidney function should be watched. Some physician's also may administer the antiviral agents via intravitreal delivery. Though controversial, some physicians administer steroids (prednisone) and antithrombotic therapy (aspirin).|$|E
50|$|Because {{the onset}} of an {{infection}} is difficult to predict, lasts {{a short period of}} time and heals rapidly, it is difficult to conduct research on cold sores. Though <b>famciclovir</b> improves lesion healing time, it is not effective in preventing lesions; valaciclovir and a mixture of acyclovir and hydrocortisone are similarly useful in treating outbreaks but may also help prevent them.|$|E
50|$|Penciclovir is a {{guanosine}} analogue {{antiviral drug}} {{used for the}} treatment of various herpesvirus infections. It is a nucleoside analogue which exhibits low toxicity and good selectivity. Because penciclovir is absorbed poorly when given orally (by mouth) it is more often used as a topical treatment. It is the active ingredient in the cold sore medications Denavir (NDC 0135-0315-52), Vectavir and Fenivir. <b>Famciclovir</b> is a prodrug of penciclovir with improved oral bioavailability.|$|E
50|$|People with {{recurrent}} genital herpes may {{be treated}} with suppressive therapy, which consists of daily antiviral treatment using acyclovir, valacyclovir or <b>famciclovir.</b> Suppressive therapy {{may be useful in}} those who have at least four recurrences per year but the quality of the evidence is poor. People with lower rates of recurrence will probably also have fewer recurrences with suppressive therapy. Suppressive therapy should be discontinued after a maximum of one year to reassess recurrence frequency.|$|E

50|$|The IHMF {{recommends}} {{that patients with}} benign recurrent lymphocytic meningitis receive intravenous acyclovir {{in the amount of}} 10 mg/kg every 8 hours, for 14-21 days. More recently, the second-generation antiherpetic drugs valacyclovir and <b>famciclovir</b> have been used to successfully treat patients with Mollaret's. Additionally, {{it has been reported that}} Indomethacin administered in the amount of 25 mg 3 times per day after meals, or 50 mg every 4 hours, has resulted in a faster recovery for patients, as well as more extended symptom-free intervals, between episodes.|$|E
50|$|Antiviral drugs {{may reduce}} the {{severity}} and duration of shingles; however, they do not prevent postherpetic neuralgia. Of these drugs, aciclovir has been the standard treatment, but the new drugs valaciclovir and <b>famciclovir</b> demonstrate similar or superior efficacy and good safety and tolerability. The drugs are used both for prevention (for example in HIV/AIDS) and as therapy during the acute phase. Complications in immunocompromised individuals with shingles may be reduced with intravenous aciclovir. In {{people who are at}} a high risk for repeated attacks of shingles, five daily oral doses of aciclovir are usually effective.|$|E
50|$|Women with {{a history}} of HSV, can be treated with {{antiviral}} drugs to prevent symptomatic lesions and viral shedding that could infect the infant at birth. The antiviral medications used include acyclovir, penciclovir, valacyclovir, and <b>famciclovir.</b> Only very small amounts of the drug can be detected in the fetus. There are no increases in drug-related abnormalities in the infant that could be attributed to acyclovir. Long-term effects of antiviral medications have not been evaluated for their effects after growth and development of the child occurs. Neutropenia can be a complication of acyclovir treatment of neonatal HSV infection, but is usually transient. Treatment with immunoglobulin therapy has not been proven to be effective.|$|E
5000|$|Resistance {{can develop}} quickly {{with as little}} as one mutation. [...] Mutations occur in the enzymes that phosphorylate the drug and {{activate}} it: {{in the case of}} herpes simplex, resistance to aciclovir arises thanks to a mutation affecting the viral enzyme thymidine kinase. Since nucleoside analogues require two phosphorylations to be activated, one carried out by a viral enzyme and the other by enzymes in the host cell, mutations in viral thymidine kinase interfere with the first of these phosphorylations; in such cases the drug remains ineffective. There are, however, several different nucleoside analogue drugs and resistance to one of them is usually overcome by switching to another drug of the same kind (e. g. <b>famciclovir,</b> penciclovir, valaciclovir).|$|E
