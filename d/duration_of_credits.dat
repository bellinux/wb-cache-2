40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} interest rate transmission mechanism and bank's management of interest rate risk during the disinflation monetary policy in the Czech Republic in 1999 - 2006. In theoretical part, main determinants of short-run and long-run equilibrium of client interest rates are discussed (market power, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> and deposits, pricing mechanism, credit risk, operation efficiency). Using the error correction model, sensitivity of credit and deposit interest rates on market interest rates is tested. It is found {{out that in the}} short equilibrium client interest rates changes follow dynamics of CNB repo rate, the sensitivity of credit and deposit interest rates differs and banks face up the pressure on interest margin. The cointegration analysis confirms change of equilibrium interest rate margin in the long-run and supports hypothesis of consistency between Czech National Bank monetary policy and its expected outcomes by banks. monetary policy, bank, disinflation, interest rates, client interest rates...|$|E

40|$|Trade {{credit and}} trade debt choices are {{strictly}} interconnected, and some drivers {{of one of}} these features are common. The literature looks prevalently at the main reason behind each choice while considering the credit and debt features separately. Only a few articles consider the two features jointly to focus on the correlation between the two types of decisions. Using an approach adopted in the literature to study other topics, we analyze the interaction between trade credit and debt to identify the primary driver of trade policy decision. This study considers the amount <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and debt and the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and debt delays while looking at contemporaneous and one-year-lagged relationships.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the theoretical literature that studies the macroeconomic implications of financial frictions. It develops frameworks to address different financial market failures, and evaluate preventive policies to mitigate {{the vulnerability of the}} economy to costly systemic crises. First, it identifies a credit risk (fire sale) externality that justifies the macroprudential regulation of short-term debt to mitigate the probability of systemic bank runs. Without regulation, banks do not internalize how their funding decisions affects the terms at which other market participants can obtain credit. The formal welfare study conducted, provides a general equilibrium notion of systemic risk that captures both fundamental insolvency and illiquidity risk. It also connects this measure with the optimal Pigouvian (corrective) tax. Second, it shows that liquidity crises may arise as the result of endogenous information panics. It finds that collective ignorance is welfare maximizing but it is fragile, susceptible to self-fulfilling fears about asymmetric information. Adverse selection may thus obtain in equilibrium, sustained by negative aggregate expectations. The mechanism that gives rise to multiple equilibria is robust to the introduction of noisy private signals, and warrants the regulation of information acquisition for rent-seeking (speculative) motives. Finally, it demonstrates the limitations <b>of</b> unconventional <b>credit</b> easing policies to stimulate lending during market-freezes. With inter-temporal investment complementarities, credit to non-financial firms may be curtailed as the result of dynamic coordination failures. Interest rate cuts mitigate coordination risk, but increase the average <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> market freezes when the productivity of capital is high. Capital injections in the banking sector, or direct lending to non-financial firms, are completely ineffective, because reductions in deposits from households crowd out government spending. In contrast, government guarantees improve welfare by reducing strategic uncertainty. by Diego Feijer. Thesis: Ph.

30|$|Practically, it is {{seen that}} the longer credit period attracts more customers. So, to {{increase}} the length <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> period increases the customers’ demand. From the literature survey on credit periods, it is studied that almost all research works have considered one manufacturer/supplier to offer the credit period to only one retailer. And there are also very few papers (Dye and Ouyang 2011) in which the retailer offers the credit period to end customer (consumer). In their paper, only one end customer has been considered. But, it is impractical to consider only one customer by which all items are consumed together. It is happened {{that there are many}} end customers by which items are procured from the retailer at different times during the business period and it is also observed that sometimes the retailer announces a credit period during some period to fascinate more end customers. But, till now no one has considered demand as a function <b>of</b> customer’s <b>credit</b> and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> offering the <b>credit</b> period.

30|$|In this paper, we have {{considered}} an {{economic order quantity}} model for deteriorating items with two-level trade credit policy in which a delay in payment is offered by a supplier to a retailer and also an another delay in payment is offered by the retailer to his/her all customers.

In this article, it is considered that the retailer’s ordering cost per order depends on the number of replenishment cycles. The objective of this model is to establish a deterministic EOQ model of deteriorating items for the retailer to decide the position <b>of</b> customers <b>credit</b> period and the number of replenishment cycles in finite time horizon such that the retailer gets the maximum profit. Also, the model is explained with the help of some numerical examples.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the results of}} a survey carried out in 2007 by the Bank of Italy concerning different characteristics of the organization of lending activities. Between 2003 and 2006 the physical distance between the headquarters and the branches increased, the limits to the decision-making process of loan officers were eased, their mobility raised and the use of economic incentives to reward their activity expanded. The huge heterogeneity in organizational structures persists even within relatively homogenous size classes. The diffusion of statistical models to assess credit risk (scoring), accelerated recently particularly among large banks, boosted by the new Basel Capital Accord. Scoring is either very important or determinant in decisions on credit extension while it is rarely influential in setting interest rates, the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> and the amount and type of collateral required. The survey shows that banks have been progressively adapting their organizational structure in order to incorporate the credit scoring tools into their lending processes. banking organization, distance, power delegation, credit scoring, relationship lending, technology diffusion...|$|R
40|$|Basis risk is {{the risk}} {{attributable}} to uncertain movements in the spread between yields associated with a particular financial instrument or class of instruments, and a reference interest rate over time. There are seven types of basis risk: Yields on 1) Long-term versus short-term financial instruments, 2) Domestic currency versus foreign currencies, 3) Liquid versus illiquid investments, 4) Bonds with higher or lower sensitivity to changes in interest rate volatility, 5) Taxable versus tax-free instruments, 6) Spot versus futures contracts and 7) Default-free versus non-default-free securities. Basis risk {{makes it difficult for}} the fixed-income portfolio manager to measure the portfolio's exposure to interest rate risk, heightens the anxiety of traders and arbitrageurs who are hedging their investments, and compounds the financial institution's problem of matching assets and liabilities. Much {{attention has been paid to}} the first type of basis risk. In recent years, attention has turned toward understanding the relation between credit risk and duration. The authors focus on that, emphasizing the importance <b>of</b> taking <b>credit</b> risk into account when computing measures <b>of</b> <b>duration.</b> The consensus <b>of</b> all work in this area is that credit risk shortens the effective <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> corporate bonds.

50|$|Bank-issued credit {{makes up}} the largest {{proportion}} <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> in existence. The traditional view of banks as intermediaries between savers and borrower is incorrect. Modern banking is about credit creation. Credit {{is made up of}} two parts, the credit (money) and its corresponding debt, which requires repayment with interest. The majority (97% as of December 2013) of the money in the UK economy is created as credit. When a bank issues credit (i.e. makes a loan), it writes a negative entry into the liabilities column of its balance sheet, and an equivalent positive figure on the assets column; the asset being the loan repayment income stream (plus interest) from a credit-worthy individual. When the debt is fully repaid, the credit and debt are cancelled, and the money disappears from the economy. Meanwhile, the debtor receives a positive cash balance (which is used to purchase something like a house), but also an equivalent negative liability to be repaid to the bank over the <b>duration.</b> Most <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> created goes into the purchase of land and property, creating inflation in those markets, which is a major driver of the economic cycle.|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> {{card in the}} {{mid-twentieth century}} revolutionized and transformed how people live. Based {{on a set of}} new survey data, this dissertation empirically investigates and analyzes consumers 2 ̆ 7 behavior in the credit card market. Specifically, it investigates the underlying determinants of consumers 2 ̆ 7 choices regarding switching credit-card balances. To estimate the likelihood that consumers switch credit cards, two logit models are estimated. Using data from the Consumer Finance Monthly (CFM) of The Ohio State University, the author finds that at the conventional 5 percent level of significance, the following variables have significance: old interest rate, new interest rate, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the introductory rate, balances, number <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> cards, home ownership, and age. As expected, interest rates, balance, and the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> new introductory offer rates have the greatest influence on why or why not people switch credit cards. The findings are consistent with the view that consumers make rational decisions in the credit card market, since balance-carrying consumers are sensitive to the terms <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> card contracts, such as the interest rate on existing balances, the new rate, and the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the new rate. It also implies that switching costs are important, challenging Ausubel 2 ̆ 7 s (1991) argument <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> card consumer irrationality and Calem and Mester 2 ̆ 7 s (1995) empirical finding that credit card rates are sticky because consumers are irresponsive and to rate cuts...|$|R
