However, some of these studies have largely been retrospective reviews of various administrative databases, while others have focused on specific aspects of the process, which may miss crucial components of the discharge process.

This imposes exacting constraints upon vision in nocturnal flying birds. Eyes are essentially heavy, fluid-filled chambers, and in flying birds their increased size is countered by selection for both reduced body mass {{and the distribution of}} mass towards the body core. Freed from these mass constraints, it would be predicted that in flightless birds nocturnality should favour the evolution of large eyes and reliance upon visual cues for the <b>guidance</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> Methodology/Principal Findings. We show that in Kiwi (Apterygidae), flightlessness and nocturnality have, in fact, resulted in the opposite outcome.

Conclusions/Significance. This lack of reliance upon vision and increased reliance upon tactile and olfactory information in Kiwi is markedly similar to the situation in nocturnal mammals that exploit the forest floor. That Kiwi and mammals evolved to exploit these habitats quite independently provides evidence for convergent evolution in their sensory capacities that are tuned to a common set of perceptual challenges found in forest floor habitats at night and which cannot be met by the vertebrate visual system.

40|$|Abstract — A major {{challenge}} in e-negotiation systems (ENS) {{is that the}} context of negotiation such as negotiators’ characteristics, negotiation processes and system support varies in each case. This context dependency {{makes it difficult to}} apply a single ENS {{to a wide variety of}} negotiations. In this paper, to mitigate the context dependency issue, we propose to adopt the componentoriented approach and the Model-View-Controller design pattern in order to develop a generic ENS platform that can run multiple ENS’s. In this approach, an ENS is developed first by designing a high level e-negotiation protocol which specifies which page composer should be called at each state. A page composer contains the logic controlling integration of the model components (e. g. queries and computation modules) and view components (e. g. display text and formatting). Restriction or <b>guidance</b> <b>of</b> negotiation <b>activities</b> can be implemented by restricting or allowing a set of functionalities on a page and/or routing them to a different page. With this approach, the efforts to develop and modify ENS can be significantly reduced. Validity and usefulness of our approach is proved by re-developing two existing ENS’s- SimpleNS and Inspire – on a generic platform called Invite, which can execute e-negotiation protocols...|$|R

Orientin and isoorientin presented similar activities toward the DPPH, with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50) of 15 – 17  μmol, and inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by 50 % at 100  μmol. Chlorogenic acid significantly inhibited intracellular ROS and nitric oxide (NO) production and had a strong effect toward DPPH. Furthermore, chlorogenic acid demonstrated decreased iNOS, COX- 2, IFN-β and TNF-α gene expression. These findings demonstrate the potential anti-inflammatory effects of chlorogenic acid.

Vigorous activity is associated with higher socio-economic position and occupational PA has the opposite association, so these changes may increase inequalities. We profiled adults' total and domain-specific ‘equivalent minutes’ of weekly PA in England 2012, and investigated inequalities in PA participation, accounting for the new weighting of vigorous PA, and new measurements of occupational PA. Nationally representative cross-sectional survey data on the self-reported PA of 8158 adults was used to produce a profile of the domain and duration of weekly ‘equivalent minutes’ of PA. Vigorous PA was double-weighted compared to moderate PA, and the percentage contribution from each PA domain quantified, stratified by gender and activity status and split by socio-demographic variables.

The main results show that (1) certain ways of planning and of revising are more effective than others and (2) depending on the writing context, writers must carry out tradeoffs between the implementation of the processes and their respective costs: They can use either planning or revision to reach comparable results.
