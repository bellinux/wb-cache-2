2500|$|Apparently, Adams communicated {{his work}} to James Challis, {{director}} of the Cambridge Observatory, in mid-September 1845 {{but there is some}} controversy as to how. On 21 October 1845, Adams, returning from a Cornwall vacation, without appointment, twice called on Astronomer Royal George Biddell Airy in Greenwich. Failing to find him at home, Adams reputedly left a manuscript of his solution, again without the detailed calculations. Airy responded with a letter to Adams asking for some clarification. It appears that Adams did not regard the question as [...] "trivial", as is often alleged, but he failed to complete a response. Various theories have been discussed as to Adams's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>reply,</b> such as his general nervousness, procrastination and disorganisation.|$|E

I certainly should not recommend another person to proceed far on such reasoning. You see {{it has been in}} this way." [...] Then he explained to his brother attorney the process of little circumstances by which he had arrived at his own opinion;--the dislike of the man to leave the house, his clinging to one room, his manifest possession of a secret as evinced by his conversations with Farmer Griffith, his continual dread of something, his very clinging to Llanfeare as a residence which would not have been the case had he destroyed the will, his exaggerated fear of the coming cross-examination, his ready assertion that he had destroyed nothing and hidden nothing,--but his <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>reply</b> when he was asked whether he was aware of any such concealment. Then the fact that the books had not been searched themselves, that the old Squire had never personally used the room, but had used a book or one or two books which had been taken from it; that these books had been volumes which had certainly been close to him in those days when the lost will was being written. All these and other little details known to the reader made the process by which Mr Apjohn had arrived at the conclusion which he now endeavoured to explain to Mr Brodrick.|$|E
60|$|She {{suggested}} {{this theory}} to Ewbert, and he denied it with blithe derision, {{but she said}} that he need not tell her, and in confirming herself in it she began to relax her belief that old Ransom Hilbrook had preyed upon him. She {{even went so far}} as to say that the only intellectual companionship he had ever had in the place was that which he found in the old man's society. When she discovered, after the fact, that Ewbert had written to him since they came away, she was not so severe with him as she might have expected herself to be in view of an act which, if not quite clandestine, was certainly without her privity. She would have considered him fitly punished by Hilbrook's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>reply,</b> if she had not shared his uneasiness at the old man's silence. But she did not allow this to affect her good spirits, which were essential to her husband's comfort as well as her own. She redoubled her care of him in every sort, and among all the ladies who admired her devotion to him there was none who enjoyed it as much as herself. There was none who believed more implicitly that it was owing to her foresight and oversight that his health mended so rapidly, and that at the end of the bathing season she was, as she said, taking him home quite another man. In her perfect satisfaction she suffered him his small joke about not feeling it quite right to go with her if that were so; and though a woman of little humor, she even professed to find pleasure in his joke after she fully understood it.|$|E

50|$|On 16 June, Dr. Hadas Gips, a {{pathologist}} {{from the}} Abu Kabir Forensic Institute, {{testified before the}} court. She stated that bleeding in Sharif's brain suggested that his heart was still beating when the bullet fired by Azaria hit his head. She also claimed {{that the rest of}} the wounds on his body were not immediately fatal and would have been saved had he been given appropriate medical treatment. When questioned by the defense team about the potential consequences of the shootings which preceded the one by Azaria, Gips stated that even after a shooting to the head which paralyzes the brain centers, the heart continues to beat sporadically. So if Sharif was shot in the head beforehand in the head, there wouldn't bleeding in other parts of the body that are not in the brain. She stated that the shot to the head was the last shot. In response to the question of whether there could be movement in the limbs after brain's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> function, she <b>replied</b> that there could be small muscle cramps but she had have reservations about this and it was the domain of neurosurgeons more familiar with the issue than her.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this article is <b>to</b> <b>reply</b> <b>to</b> the central point of Fodor and Pylyshyn's (1988) {{critique}} of connectionism. The direct <b>reply</b> <b>to</b> their critique comprises Section 2 of this paper. In short, I argue that Fodor and Pylyshyn are simply mistaken in their claim that con-nectionist mental states lack the necessary constituent structure, and that the basis of this mistake is a <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> appreciate the significance of distributed representations in connectionist models. Section 3 is a broader response to the bottom line of their critique, which is that connectionists should re-orient their work towards implementation of the classical symbolic cognitive architecture. I argue instead that connectionist research should develop new formalizations of the fundamental computational notions that have been given one particular formal shape in the traditional symbolic paradigm. My response to Fodor and Pylyshyn's critique presumes a certain meta-theoretical context that is laid out in Section 1. In this first sectio...|$|R

50|$|In a postscript, {{the novel}} then skips forward thirty-two years to {{them both in}} late middle age (Leonard now circa 57, Maria circa 62). Leonard has {{received}} a letter from Maria explaining that she was never unfaithful to him with Glass until after his <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>reply</b> to her letters, from which she took it that things were over between herself and Leonard. Maria tells Leonard she later married Bob Glass in New York, moved to America, and bore three children by him, but that Glass has recently died of a heart attack. She reveals that Glass found out about Otto and helped cover for the killing, which was the true reason for their suspicious behaviour together. The novel ends with Leonard deciding to fly to America and pay a surprise visit on Maria at her home.|$|E
50|$|The National Command {{replied to}} these accusations by declaring that al-Rikabi was {{unqualified}} {{to speak for}} the party, and furthermore that he had lost his right to speak on the behalf of the Iraqi Regional Branch of the Ba'ath Party when the Iraqi Regional Command was dissolved on 29 November 1959. The reconstituted Iraqi Regional Command passed a resolution on 2 February 1962 which expelled al-Rikabi from the organisation and appointed Talib Hussein ash-Shabibi as Secretary General. Attacks on al-Rikabi continued, and the Iraqi Regional Congress in July 1960 called the National Command to initiate an investigation against him. At the fourth national conference in Beirut, the National Command passed a resolution stating that al-Rikabi had henceforth no responsibilities in Ba'ath Party affairs. On 14 October 1960 the Ba'ath Party ordered al-Rikabi to reply to the accusations leveled against him by the Iraqi Regional Congress. Al-Rikabi was expelled from the Ba'ath Party on 15 June 1961 for his <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>reply</b> to the accusations leveled against him, his support for the Revolutionary Ba'ath Command, and his distribution of anti-National Command thoughts not through the proper party organs.|$|E

40|$|First, some reminiscences. In {{the years}} 1973 - 80, when I was an {{undergraduate}} and then {{graduate student at}} Oxford, Michael Dummett’s formidable and creative philosophical presence made his arguments impossible to ignore. In consequence, one pole of discussion was always a form of anti-realism. It endorsed something like the replacement of truth-conditional semantics by verification-conditional semantics and of classical logic by intuitionistic logic, and the principle that all truths are knowable. It did not endorse the principle that all truths are known. Nor did it mention the now celebrated argument, first published by Frederic Fitch (1963), that if all truths are knowable then all truths are known. Even in 1970 s Oxford, intuitionistic anti-realism was a strictly minority view, but many others regarded it as a live theoretical option {{in a way that}} now seems very distant. As the extreme verificationist commitments of the view have combined with accumulating decades of <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>reply</b> convincingly to criticisms of the arguments in its favour or to carry out the programme of generalizing intuitionistic semantics for 1 mathematics to empirical discourse, even in toy examples, the impression has bee...|$|E

Within an episode, the player controls a protagonist as the story progresses through several scenes.

Other scenes are based on cinematic elements using quick time events in which the player must hit a controller button or a keyboard command as indicated on screen to react <b>to</b> an event. <b>Failure</b> <b>to</b> do so in time {{can lead to the}} character's death or other undesirable ending, and the game will restart just prior to these scenes.|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of fair play is widely thought to require simply that {{costs and benefits}} be distributed fairly. This gloss on the principle, while not entirely inaccurate, has invited a host of popular objections based on misunderstandings about fair play.

I offer an interpretation of the principle of fair play that emphasizes its similarities to another transactional principle: consent.
