40|$|Many European {{countries}} tend {{to shift}} from constructing combined sewer systems to separate ones, in order to optimise wastewater treatment efficiency and reduce CSO impact on surface waters. An economic design minimises maintenance requirements by aiming at self-cleansing pipes. However, providing the necessary slopes for self-cleansing sanitary sewer pipes often is unfeasible in flat regions, resulting in {{an increased risk of}} loss of hydraulic capacity or blocking. To reduce these risks, flushing tanks can be installed in the sewer system. Where most other researchers contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the hydraulics of flushing, this paper rather tries to formulate a methodology to design and test <b>flushing</b> <b>devices</b> in sanitary sewer systems using standards and hydrodynamic simulations. Therefore, several aspects that require consideration when incorporating <b>flushing</b> <b>devices</b> into a sanitary sewer system are discussed. For instance, when flushing sanitary sewers the increase in discharge has to be explicitly considered. A Belgian case study is used to investigate the suitability of the developed methodology.

Experiments were carried out on a laboratory channel adopting a simple <b>flushing</b> <b>device</b> and considering different flushing conditions. Accurate measurements on the evolution of mobile-bed deposits and on sediment transported during the flushing operations were carried out.

40|$|International audienceSewer {{deposits}} {{have been}} identified as a major cause of dysfunctions in combined sewer systems regarding sewer management, which induces different negative consequents resulting in poor hydraulic conveyance, environmental damages as well as worker’s health. In order to overcome the problematics of sedimentation, flushing has been considered as the most operative and cost-effective way to minimize the sediments impacts and prevent such challenges. Flushing, by prompting turbulent wave effects, can modify the bed form depending on the hydraulic properties and geometrical characteristics of the conduit. So far, the dynamics of the bed-load during high-flow events in combined sewer systems as a complex environment is not well understood, mostly due to lack of measuring devices capable to work in the “hostile” in combined sewer system correctly. In this regards, a one-episode flushing issue from an opening gate valve with weir function was carried out in a trunk sewer in Paris to understanding its cleansing efficiency on the sediments (thickness: 0 - 30 cm). During more than 1 h of flushing within 5 m distance in downstream of this <b>flushing</b> <b>device,</b> a maximum flowrate and a maximum level of water have been recorded at 5 m in downstream of the gate as 4. 1 m 3 /s and 2. 1 m respectively. This paper is aimed to evaluate the efficiency of this type of gate for around 1. 1 km (from the point - 50 m to + 1050 m in downstream from the gate) by (i) determining bed grain-size distribution and sediments evolution through the sewer channel, as well as their organic matter content, and (ii) identifying sections that exhibit more changes in their texture after the flush. For the first one, two series of sampling were taken from the sewer length and then analyzed in laboratory, one before flushing and second after, at same points among the sewer channel. Hence, a non-intrusive sampling instrument has undertaken to extract the sediments smaller than the fine gravels. The comparison between sediments texture after the flush operation and the initial state, revealed the most modified zones by the flush effect, regarding the sewer invert slope and hydraulic parameters in the zone up to 400 m from the gate. At this distance, despite the increase of sediment grain-size rages, D 50 (median grain-size) varies between 0. 6 mm and 1. 1 mm compared to 0. 8 mm and 10 mm before and after flushing, respectively. Overall, regarding the sewer channel invert slope, results indicate that grains smaller than sands (< 2 mm) are more transported to downstream along about 400 m from the gate: in average 69 % before against 38 % after the flush with more dispersion of grain-sizes distributions. Furthermore, high effect of the channel bed irregularities on the bed material evolution has been observed after the flush...|$|E
40|$|A {{potable water}} {{distribution}} system (WDS) consists of pipes, pumps, valves, storage tanks, control and supporting components. Traditionally, {{it has two}} basic functions. First, provides end users with potable water at sufficient pressures and good water quality. Second, provides sufficient pressure and flow for fire fighting. Currently, potable water is still the least expensive material for fire fighting. To accomplish these two goals, water utilities {{have to consider the}} integrity and security of the water network. As a result, this research selected three research topics that are closely related to the daily operation of water utilities and water quality simulation. The first study is on optimal sampling design for chlorine decay model calibration. Three questions are investigated: (1) What is the minimum number of chlorine sample locations a water network needs? (2) How many combinations of sampling locations are available? (3) What is the optimal location combination? To answer the first two questions, the mathematical expressions of the chlorine concentrations between any two sampling locations are developed and sampling point relationship matrices are generated, then a mixed integer programming (MIP) algorithm is developed. Once obtained, the solutions to the first two questions are used to calculate the chlorine decay wall reaction coefficients and sensitivity matrix of chlorine concentration wall reaction coefficients; then, sampling location combinations achieved in the second question are sorted using a D-optimality algorithm. The model frame is demonstrated in a case study. The advantage of this method, compared to the traditional iterative sensitivity matrix method, is that a prior knowledge or estimation of wall reaction coefficients is not necessary. The second study is on optimizing the operation scheduling of automatic <b>flushing</b> <b>device</b> (AFD) in water distribution system. Discharging stagnant water from the pipeline through AFD is a feasible method to maintain water quality. This study presents a simulation-based optimization method to minimize total AFD discharge volume during a 24 -hour horizon. EPANET 2. 0 is used as hydraulics and water quality simulator. This is formulated as a single objective optimization problem. The decision variables are the AFD operation patterns. The methodology has three phases. In the first phase, AFD discharge capacities are calculated, whether existing AFDs are able to maintain chlorine residuals in the water network is also evaluated. In the second phase, the decision variables are converted to AFD discharge rates. A reduced gradient algorithm is used to quickly explore and narrow down the solution space. At the end of this phase, decision variables are switched back to the AFD operation patterns. In the third phase, simulated annealing is used to search intensively to exploit the global minimum. The method is demonstrated on the water system located {{at the south end of}} Pinellas County, Florida where AFD optimal operation patterns are achieved. The third study is on simulating contaminant intrusion in water distribution system. When contaminant matrix is introduced into water distribution system, it reacts with chlorine in bulk water rapidly and causes fast disinfectant depletion. Due to the difficulties in identifying contaminant types and chemical and biological properties, it is a challenging task to use EPANET-MSX to simulate chlorine decay under contaminant attack. EPANET 2. 0 is used in the study to accomplish this goal. However, EPANET 2. 0 cannot directly simulate chlorine depletion in the event of contamination attack because it assigns one time-independent bulk reaction coefficient to one specific pipe during the simulation. While under contaminant intrusion, chlorine decay bulk coefficient is not a constant. Instead, it is a temporal and spatial variable. This study presents an innovative approach for simulating contaminant intrusion in water distribution systems using EPANET multiple times. The methodology has six general steps. First, test bulk reaction coefficients of contaminant matrix in chemical lab. The uniqueness of this study is that the contaminant matrix is studied as a whole. The investigations of chemical, biological properties of individual aqueous constituents are not needed. Second, assume the contaminants as nonreactive, using EPANET 2. 0 to identify where, when and at what concentrations of the inert contaminants will pass by in the water network. Third, determine the number of chlorine residual simulations based on the results in step two. Fourth, use EPANET to simulate the chlorine residual in the water network without the occurrence of contamination. Fifth, assign contaminated bulk coefficients to contaminated pipes; use EPANET to simulate the chlorine residual in the pipe network. Lastly, the chlorine concentrations of the impacted moments of impacted junctions are replaced with the results calculated in step five. This methodology is demonstrated in the south Pinellas County water distribution system...|$|E

40|$|Prevention of sewer {{sediment}} accumulation, {{which can}} cause major sewer operational problems, is imperative and has been an immense concern for sewer designers. So far, researchers have mostly attempted to investigate the conditions where sewer systems can operate under self-cleansing condition, this way neglecting the essential attention {{that has to be}} addressed to sediment deposition patterns which occur in sewer reaches under various sewer geometrical and hydraulic conditions. To account for the effects of sediment formation in sewer systems, an appropriate sediment transport modelling with the ability to determine the location and depth of sediment deposit is needed. Besides, in order to prescribe proper solutions for the removal of the deposited layers these models need to appropriately analyse the in-sewer sediment transport patterns. In this regards, a validated numerical model incorporating shock-capturing TVD-McCormack scheme, developed in the University of Catania, Italy, is utilized in this research to help determine the sediment accumulation patterns in rectangular sewer channels, and to evaluate the sediment transport capacities that can be reached by implementing flushing devices and in particular the Giehl flushing tank (manufactured in Germany). Initially, the simulations are carried out to obtain the sediment bed deposition along the rectangular flumes (with geometries close to sewers) in stormwater sewer conditions (specifying a particular dry-weather period). This is followed by simulating the sediment heights after erosion by successive flushes in order to inspect the eroded sediment volume from the deposited bed and the cleaned channel lengths achieved by means of the applied flushes. Moreover, the sediment entrainment and bed-load transport due to flushing is also investigated in sewer channels with uniform bed layers under stormwater and combined sewer environments. It is discovered that in channels with widths up to 500 mm and sufficient bed slope (e. g. 20 , which might be the case in quite a number of stormwater sewer networks) 20 to 50 flushes by Giehl flushing tanks can lead to the erosion of deposited sediment layers with a length between 50 and 100 m. Besides, 50 successive flushes demonstrated sufficient capacity to completely erode up to (and possibly more than) a length of 20 m of a 4 cm thick uniform bed layer composed of medium grit particles, d 50 &# 8804; 0. 5 mm, in stormwater sewer channels with widths up to 250 mm with minimum inverted slope of 8  or higher. Under the same conditions, a bed composed of coarser particles, d 50 &# 8804; 0. 8 mm, only the upper 2. 5 cm of the 4 cm thick bed will erode. Under combined sewer conditions, 50 successive flushes will erode over a length of at least 20 m a 5 cm uniform bed layer composed of fine combined sewer sediment, d 50 &# 8804; 0. 08 mm, &# 961;s&# 8804; 1600 kg/m 3, in channels with widths up to 500 mm with inverted slope of 5  or higher. In channels of 100 m length or longer, and considering an inverted slope in the range 2  to 8 , 50 successive flushes seem to be deficient in scouring a 2. 5 cm thick sediment bed. In general terms it is discovered that Giehl flushing tanks are able to remove over a distance of 50 m the uniform sediment layers with depths below 4 cm in combined sewers with widths smaller than 250 mm. In a subsequent investigation, the InfoWorks CS software (Innovyze Co., UK) is utilized to evaluate the efficiency of the flushes from Giehl flushing tanks in increasing the required sediment scouring forces, particularly the bottom shear stresses, in sewer pipes. Initially, the effect of the flushes in long pipe-series is assessed so that an intuition concerning the propagation of the flushes through long distances together with the corresponding shear stress enhancements can be attained. After that, the increase in bottom shear stresses by the flushes along 20, 50, and 100 -m channels is inspected. It is detected that in combined/stormwater sewers with diameters of 250 to 500 mm and inverted slopes smaller than 8 , and considering a sediment-cleansing threshold of 3. 385 N/m 2, the effective flushing lengths are limited to 20 to 42 m (respectively in wider and narrower channels). In sanitary networks (considering a self-cleansing threshold of 2 N/m 2), the sediment-cleansing efficiency is more discernible and given an inverted slope of maximum 8  the flushing length varies between 100 m in narrow channels down to 54 m in wider channels. In brief, Giehl flushing tanks are believed to be suitable devices for generating self-cleansing hydraulic forces up to a distance of 50 m in narrow (i. e. width up to 250 mm) combined/stormwater sewers, even exceeding 100 m in narrow sanitary sewers with moderate inverted slopes of maximum 8 . Subsequently, through a novel attempt the most appropriate position of this <b>flushing</b> <b>device</b> in sewer networks for optimum efficiency in terms of self-cleansing maintenance is investigated with the application to a case study, i. e. sewer network of Erpe-Mere in Flanders, Belgium. In the latter attempt, the sediment deposition and erosion is modelled using InfoWorks CS with the double aim to investigate the effect of the flushes on the scour of deposited sediment beds and to discover the lengths along which a specific self-cleansing criterion can be maintained by the discharged flushes. The possible negative impacts in terms of sewer surcharging or manhole flooding is also inspected. The self-cleansing shear stresses were achieved in 61 sewers or in 69. 3 % of the pipes suitable for the installation of a flushing tank, covering a total cleansing length of 5788 m, representing 74. 4 % of total length of the pipes apt to the implementation of flushing tanks. It is deduced that flushing tanks cannot always guarantee self-cleansing prevalence in all parts of a sewer network, even after increasing the number of flushing tanks particularly in locations prone to sedimentation. Moreover, Giehl flushing tanks do not guarantee the removal of sediments from places susceptible for sedimentation. For these locations in order to prevent the accumulation of sediments and once deposited for theirerosion the effectiveness of a Giehl flushing tank has to be assessed separately, using an appropriate sediment transport modelling tool. In this accordance, it is agreed that InfoWorks CS is incapable of properly simulating the sediment bed development (deposition phase) and the change in sediment heights during flushing operations in sewer channels. In the end, through an unexampled attempt the two numerical models, i. e. InfoWorks CS being a commercial software and the Catania model as a specialized research-based numerical model, developed for different type of objectives and circumstances, are compared for identical channels with respect to the simulated hydraulic components and sediment deposition patters. Accordingly, the application of the Giehl flushing tank in this sewer network is evaluated with reference to the sediment deposition results achieved earlier by the Catania numerical model, so that by learning the potential spots with the highest sediment deposition likelihood the implementation of these flushing tanks can be optimized. This would require sediment transport and hydraulic modelling schemes to be integrated. status: publishe...|$|E

At {{most of these}} sites, rainwater tanks are located adjacent and provide water for domestic purposes to the workers’ camp. The water has long been suspected of contamination, although it has not previously been tested. The objective {{of this study is}} to assess the quality of the collected water and consider any health risks in accordance with the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines. Following initial testing, first <b>flush</b> <b>devices</b> were installed with the aim of measuring any improvement in water quality. The study considered 25 different metals, total petroleum hydrocarbons (reported in four different carbon fractions), heterotrophic plate count and Escherichia coli contamination in the water. The study also included testing for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which were determined to be the most likely contaminant to cause failure to comply with Australian Drinking Water Guidelines at these sites. Twenty-three different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were considered, both in the collected water and the dry buildup of contaminants on the roof. The study investigated the effects of variable parameters such as rainfall patterns, wind speed and direction, materials used in rainwater goods and detention time. The results clearly indicated that the stored water is unfit for domestic purposes and should not be consumed. Metals concentrations were the main cause of non-compliance with Australian Drinking Water Guidelines. In most cases the study was not able to clearly define whether these contaminants originate from diesel particulate matter. The first <b>flush</b> <b>devices</b> had little effect on harvested rainwater quality in comparison to other parameters.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundUp to 85 % of {{hospital}} in-patients will require {{some form of}} vascular access device to deliver essential fluids, drug therapy, nutrition and blood products, or facilitate sampling. The failure rate of these devices is unacceptably high, with 20 – 69 % of peripheral intravenous catheters and 15 – 66 % of central venous catheters failing due to occlusion, depending on the device, setting and population. A range of strategies {{have been developed to}} maintain device patency, including intermittent flushing. However, there is limited evidence informing flushing practice and {{little is known about the}} current flushing practices. ObjectiveThe aim of the study was to improve our understanding of current flushing practices for vascular access devices through a survey of practice. MethodA cross-sectional survey of nurses and midwives working in the State of Queensland, Australia was conducted using a 25 -item electronic survey that was distributed via the local union membership database. ResultsA total of 1178 surveys were completed and analysed, with n= 1068 reporting peripheral <b>device</b> <b>flushing</b> and n= 584 reporting central <b>device</b> <b>flushing.</b> The majority of respondents were registered nurses (55 %) caring for adult patients (63 %). A large proportion of respondents (72 % for peripheral, 742 / 1028; 80 % for central, 451 / 566) were aware of their facility's policy for vascular access <b>device</b> <b>flushing.</b> Most nurses reported using sodium chloride 0. 9 % for flushing both peripheral (96 %, 987 / 1028) and central devices (75 %, 423 / 566). Some concentration of heparin saline was used by 25 % of those <b>flushing</b> central <b>devices.</b> A 10 -mL syringe was used by most respondents for flushing; however, 24 % of respondents used smaller syringes in the peripheral device group. Use of prefilled syringes (either commercially prepared sterile or prefilled in the workplace) was limited to 10 % and 11 % respectively for each group. The frequency of flushing varied widely, with the most common response being pro re nata (23 % peripheral and 21 % central), or 6 hourly (23 % peripheral and 22 % central). Approximately half of respondents stated that there was no medical order or documentation for either peripheral or central <b>device</b> <b>flushing.</b> ConclusionsFlushing practices for vascular access <b>device</b> <b>flushing</b> appear to vary widely. Specific areas of practice that warrant further investigation include questions about the efficacy of heparin for central <b>device</b> <b>flushing,</b> increasing adherence to the recommended 10 mL diameter syringe use, increased use of prefilled flush syringes, identifying and standardising optimal volumes and frequency of flushing, and improving documentation of flush orders and administration...|$|R
50|$|Chlorine based {{anti-fouling}} solutions {{offer an}} alternative to TBT. These types of anti-fouling solutions generally involve a device attached {{to the end of}} the probe which bathes the sensors in a chlorine solution, then <b>flushes</b> the <b>device</b> and reintroduces new seawater. One such example would be Green Eyes's ProbeGuard which can be used to protect sensors during long-term submerged deployments.|$|R

Research findings provide a strong base for changing practice to using saline instead of heparin to <b>flush</b> these <b>devices</b> in children over 28 days old and in adults. This research-based change in practice will {{enhance the quality of}} care that patients receive and decrease the costs of their care...|$|R
40|$|A “cannot-ventilate, cannot-intubate” {{situation}} is critical. In difficult airway management, transtracheal jet ventilation (TTJV) has been recommended as an invasive procedure, but specialized equipment is required. However, {{the influence of}} upper airway resistance (UAR) during TTJV has not been clarified. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare TTJV using a manual jet ventilator (MJV) and the oxygen <b>flush</b> <b>device</b> of the anesthetic machine (AM). We made a model lung offering variable UAR by adjustment of tracheal tube size that can ventilate through a 14 -G cannula. We measured side flow due to the Venturi effect during TTJV, inspired tidal volume (TVi), and expiratory time under various inspiratory times. No Venturi effect was detected during TTJV with either device. With the MJV, TVi tended to increase in proportion to UAR. With AM, significant variations in TVi was not detected with changes in any UAR. In conclusion, UAR influenced forward flow of TTJV in the model lung. The influence of choked flow from the Venturi effect was minimal under all UAR settings with the MJV, but the AM could not deliver sufficient flow...|$|R
