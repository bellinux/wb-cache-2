By {{the latter part of}} the 17th century there <b>were</b> two <b>mills,</b> but the second mill did not survive. The <b>mill</b> <b>was</b> {{independent}} of Souldern Manor, and being on the county and parish boundary with Aynho <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have served both villages. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> the <b>mill</b> that <b>was</b> referred to as [...] "Aynho Mill" [...] in 1797. A watermill between the two villages was still working in 1920.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has never}} been {{explained}} why Yass was the home {{to a number of}} flour mills, especially as the district is well known for the production of fine merino fleece. Linge notes that many [...] "flour mills" [...] were set up for the personal convenience of settlers rather than commercial operations (Linge 1979:108) and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> that the <b>Mills</b> <b>were</b> set up to grind locally produced grain for largely domestic consumption.|$|R

[...] <b>Mill</b> argues that the fullest liberty of {{expression}} is required to push arguments to their logical limits, rather than the limits of social embarrassment. However, Mill also introduced {{what is known as the}} harm principle, in placing the following limitation on free expression: [...] "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others." ...|$|R

The mill burnt down in 1917 and was rebuilt and worked by steam power until 1960. It finally closed after damage suffered in the floods of September 1968. [...] The mill supplied paper used for postage stamps. Although often referred to as being in Borough Green, the mill site actually stands within the parish of Platt.|$|R

5000|$|The oat grains are dehusked by impact, then {{heated and}} cooled to {{stabilize}} the oat groats - the seed inside the husk. The process of heating produces a nutty flavour in the oats. These oat groats <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>milled</b> to produce fine, medium or coarse oatmeal. [...] Steel-cut oats <b>may</b> <b>be</b> small and contain broken groats from the dehusking process (these bits <b>may</b> <b>be</b> steamed and flattened to produce smaller rolled oats).|$|R

A significant part of the bran and germ meal would then be sifted off, resulting in a Special Sifted meal - of lower quality than roller milled meal and higher quality than hammer milled meal.|$|R
