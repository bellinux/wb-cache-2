25|$|Cattle are farmed for beef, veal, dairy, and leather, {{and they}} are less {{commonly}} used for conservation grazing, simply to maintain grassland for wildlife – for example, in Epping Forest, England. They are often used {{in some of the}} most wild places for livestock. Depending on the breed, cattle can survive on hill grazing, heaths, marshes, moors and semidesert. Modern cattle are more commercial than older breeds and, having become more specialized, are less versatile. For this reason, many smaller farmers still favor old breeds, such as the Jersey <b>dairy</b> <b>breed.</b>|$|E
2500|$|It is {{estimated}} that 42% of all livestock-related human fatalities {{are a result of}} bull attacks, and only about one in twenty victims of a bull attack survives. <b>Dairy</b> <b>breed</b> bulls are particularly dangerous and unpredictable; the hazards of bull handling are a significant cause of injury and death for dairy farmers {{in some parts of the}} United States. [...] Most cattle breeders recognize the importance of looking after expensive bulls that are expected to improve herds and profits. Nonetheless, the dangers of bull handling, particularly from dairy bulls in close quarters, are regularly proven by the obituaries. Good bull management and safety practices require caution in handling beef and dairy bulls, and use of the nose ring and chain is a recommended precaution for modern farmers.|$|E

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{aimed to}} describe the influence of production system on the following characteristics from seven Spanish goat breeds: carcass weight, dressing percentage, head weight, viscera weight, kidney fat weight, fatness score, carcass length, leg length, rump perimeter, rump width, kidney fat colour and tissue composition of shoulder. Experiment involved 201 male, single-birth suckling kids from five meat and two <b>dairy</b> <b>breeds.</b> Animals from meat breeds were slaughtered at two targets carcass weights (light, 4 kg; heavy, 7 kg). In <b>dairy</b> <b>breeds,</b> half of the animals were reared with dam’s milk {{and the other half}} with a milk replacer and all of them were slaughtered at light weight (4 kg). Statistics consisted in two GLM, means for each variable, a PCA to study relationships between variables and a discriminant analysis to compare <b>breeds.</b> In <b>dairy</b> <b>breeds,</b> breed had greater influence than milk diet, with breed effect being par-ticularly strong for kids that were fed with natural milk. In meat breeds, slaughter weight was more important than breed and many significant interactions were found between both effects. All carcass traits were closely related {{to each other and to}} slaughter weight. Slaughter weight was also positively related to dressing percentage and to fatness degree. Discriminant analysis explained 76. 1 % of variability and separated <b>dairy</b> <b>breeds,</b> with well-fattened, medium-shape...|$|R
