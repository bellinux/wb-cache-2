His work with the commission led {{him to make a}} personal donation of funds and property to the Flower Mission of Indianapolis in 1895. Lilly's substantial donation allowed it to establish Eleanor Hospital, a children's hospital in Indianapolis named in honor of his deceased daughter. The hospital cared for children from families who had no money to pay for routine medical care; it closed in 1909.|$|E
5|$|The {{remoteness}} of Dawson {{proved an}} ongoing {{problem for the}} supply of food, and as the population grew to 5,000 in 1897, this became critical. When the rivers iced over, {{it became clear that}} there would not be enough food for that winter. The NWMP evacuated some prospectors without supplies to Fort Yukon in Alaska from September 30 onwards, while others made {{their way out of the}} Klondike in search of <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>shelter</b> for the winter.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{approximately}} 100,000people {{were facing}} starvation. Then-Haitian president Louis Borno {{reported that the}} government had inefficient resources for recovery and asked citizens to assist with repairing infrastructure and providing <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>shelter</b> to others. The Government of Haiti, in turn, appropriated $200,000 for relief. Eleven storages with relief supplies were established throughout the country. The approximately 10,000people left homeless were temporarily houses in larger, undamaged buildings. Within {{a few months after the}} storm, 299homes were rebuilt or repair, costing almost $37,000. The vehicular paths destroyed by the hurricane were eventually replaced by -wide paved gravel roads. In September, the American Red Cross donated $10,000 to the Haitian Red Cross.|$|E

5|$|On {{the return}} journey, the Clan cats decide, after {{consultation}} with Midnight, {{to go through}} a mountain range which they had avoided in their initial travels. There, they meet a Clan-like group of cats called the Tribe of Rushing Water, who have their own set of ancestors: the Tribe of Endless Hunting. The Tribe takes the traveling cats in and gives them <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>shelter.</b> The Clan cats discover that the Tribe cats have a prophecy: a silver cat will save them from Sharptooth, a savage lion-like creature that has been killing many members of the Tribe. The Tribe thinks that Stormfur is the silver cat from the prophecy, and he is therefore expected to protect the Tribe from Sharptooth. Stormfur eventually agrees to help the Tribe.|$|E
5|$|His fiancée is {{determined}} to prove his innocence, but knows not how to establish it. She meets a homeless man, who closely resembles Jack, {{who is about to}} commit a crime by smashing a window. The man desires to go to prison, believing it to be the only way that he will have <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>shelter.</b> The girl recognizes the opportunity and plans to pay him for taking the place of her fiancée in prison. The man consents and the heiress concocts a clever substitution that proves successful via change of clothes. Jack, now free, confronts the aunt—who believes that his reappearance is a ghostly one. The aunt confesses that the baron's wounds were self-inflicted and the circumstantial evidence that the servant and policeman had seen was an erroneous. The substitute convict is pardoned and released from prison without the swap ever being known. For his plot, the French baron is convicted for perjury and sent to the state prison.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, Copeland {{initially}} made $210 {{per week}} {{while working for}} WWF without an official contract. The company also paid for his outstanding college debt, which was around $40,000. After a Grand Prix Wrestling tour {{in the summer of}} 1997, De Marco urged Copeland to go to Calgary, where Hart was informally training wrestlers while recovering from knee surgery. He spent his tour earnings on a plane ticket and landed with no money or place to stay. He called Johnny Smith, whom he would met twice, and Smith agreed to give him <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>shelter.</b> Smith also drove Copeland to and from the gym and Hart's house, where he trained alongside Ken Shamrock, Test, Mark Henry and Kurrgan. Copeland returned to the Maritimes for another Grand Prix tour before going back to Hart's house, bringing Christian with him. After this camp, Hart was impressed enough to put in a good word for both men at the WWF.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, Tampico {{was left}} without power or communications. About 15,000people became {{homeless}} {{due to the}} storm, or previously from Hurricane Gladys. The governor of Tamaulipas {{declared a state of}} emergency and requested assistance from the military to provide <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>shelter.</b> Within a day after the storm, water access was restored, although the city initially remained without power or telephone. Communications were cut to Tampico, except for the airport at the radio. The rail line from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City was cut during the storm, but was restored ten days later. Due to ongoing flood conditions, there was an outbreak of dysentery that killed two children. The Mexican government flew medical supplies, food, and clothing from Mexico City to Tampico, while four United States helicopters assisted in rescue missions along the Pánuco River. About 10days after Hilda struck Tampico, Hurricane Janet affected the same area, causing further damage and deaths. Collectively, the two hurricanes caused 1,240deaths along their paths, and damage from the consecutive storms totaled about half of Mexico's 1955 national budget. After the two hurricanes, the Mexican government and military worked to assist the affected residents, and the Mexican Red Cross provided vaccinations and medical assistance to prevent the spread of disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} King Solomon's Ring, Konrad Lorenz {{described}} and analysed the complex social interactions {{in a western}} jackdaw flock that lived around his house in Altenberg, Austria. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration. He found that the birds have a linear hierarchical group structure, with higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked birds, and pair-bonded birds sharing the same rank. Young males establish their individual status before pairing with females. Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order, and are the last {{to have access to}} <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>shelter.</b> Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the flock, became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in the flock.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the damage on Saint Martin, officials in the Netherlands Antilles issued {{an appeal to the}} European Parliament for assistance from the international community. Due to their small population and area, the small islands of the eastern Caribbean required international funding to repair the damage from the hurricane and return to normal. In Antigua and Barbuda, officials worked quickly to repair roads and clean Barbuda's water system. However, 20,000people in Antigua remained without water for a week after the hurricane, and the stagnant water caused an increase in mosquitoes. The government of Dominica provided 42families with temporary shelters. With a loan from the Caribbean Development Bank, the government worked to complete a sea wall along a highway south of its capital Roseau. The Saint Lucian government provided housing to 70families. In Grenada, workers repaired the road system to allow fuel transportation across the island and began to reclaim land near its airport to mitigate erosion. Regions in Antigua and Grenada were declared disaster areas. Across the eastern Caribbean, local Red Cross offices provided <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>shelter</b> to affected citizens. High damage to tourist areas caused a decrease in cruise lines. A damaged hotel in Nevis left 800people unemployed due to its closure.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, Pakistani {{officials}} set up 26 relief camps where residents were offered <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>shelter.</b> Roughly 3,000 people sought refuge in these shelters. Mobile units were also set up by the District Health Department to minimize the impacts of any post-storm diseases. On October3, Imtiaz Ahmed Shaikh expressed his grief over the damage caused by Cyclonic Storm Onil and stated that he would be touring the affected region within the following days. At least 40million Pakistani rupee ($469,000USD) was allocated in relief funds by Sindh Minister Syed Papoo Shah. On October4, port officials stated that it was safe for fishermen to resume their activities in the Arabian Sea. Later that day, a rain emergency was declared for Hyderabad and emergency shelters were set up in the city. All officers in the Hyderabad Development Authority who were initially put on leave ahead of the cyclone were told to resume work to assist in clearing drainage systems. Several days after the storm, reports indicated that there were more than 300 instances where the city's drainage system collapsed across the area, resulting in standing water in many structures. Residents in these areas, frustrated by the lack of quick action by the government, began holding protests about the flooding. In response to these protests, Shaukat Hayat Bhutto suspended Assistant Engineer Sewage manager, Qamar Memon, for his negligence on draining flood waters.|$|E
5|$|The first book, The Quest Begins, {{shows how}} {{each of the}} four bears are either {{abandoned}} or separated from their parents. Kallik is separated from her mother and brother when a pod of orcas (killer whales) eat her mother, while her brother was still {{on the other side of}} the canal, thinking they were both dead. After this, Kallik travels to find her brother. Toklo is abandoned by his mother after his brother, Tobi, dies and his mother sees how the salmon is disappearing, and left Toklo to travel alone. Lusa was born and raised in a zoo. Her story intertwines with Toklo's after his mother is brought to the zoo and Lusa hears of the wild. Hoping to leave her home, she escapes the zoo and looks for Toklo. Meanwhile, Toklo finds Ujurak injured and helps him; they begin to travel together. They meet up with Lusa at the end of the book.

Although Kallik finds her brother Taqqiq, he has joined a group of bullying bears who kidnap a black bear cub. Taqqiq sees that what he did was wrong and joins the questing bears but he soon leaves the group in the third book when he feels he does not belong with them. The remaining four cubs learn of a place called the Last Great Wilderness in the third book, where there is plentiful <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>shelter.</b> After defying hardships such as hunger and bear hunters, they finally make it to the Last Great Wilderness. However, even though they are there, Ujurak, who leads the journey, feels that they need to go further, into the Arctic. In Fire in the Sky, the bears leave the Last Great Wilderness and travel towards the Arctic. In the sixth and final book of the first series, Spirits in the Stars, the four bears make it to Star Island, a place where many polar bears live. They find a sick mother polar bear and her cub. The mother dies from sickness and the four bears look after her cub. Toklo finds that he also struggles with his urge to become a brown bear and travel alone. The bears save the polar bears that inhabit Star Island by destroying an oil rig that was poisoning the seals that they eat, but Ujurak dies in an avalanche while saving the others. Yakone, a young white bear who lived on the strange Star Island with the sick bears, is added to the group of bears on the last page of the book.|$|E
