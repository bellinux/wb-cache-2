5|$|By road, Odense {{connects to}} Zealand and Jutland with the Funish Motorway (Fynske Motorvej), {{a section of}} the E20, and to Svendborg on the {{southern}} part of <b>Funen</b> by way of the Svendborg Motorway (Svendborgmotorvejen), which comprises the Danish Route 9. Other, smaller routes connect Odense to the rest of <b>Funen,</b> with direct links to all coastal towns.|$|E
5|$|From the 16th {{century the}} town was the meeting-place of several parliaments, and until 1805 Odense was {{the seat of the}} provincial {{assembly}} of <b>Funen.</b> By 1700 Odense's population was about 4,000.|$|E
5|$|<b>Funen</b> Art Academy is an independent, nationally {{recognized}} educational institution {{located in the}} Brandts complex in central Odense which offers 5-year course in the visual arts.|$|E
5|$|On November 11 Hans Shack and {{his forces}} boarded Dutch {{transport}} ships {{to take them}} to the east side of <b>Funen.</b> After some false starts, due to weather and Swedish resistance, he managed to land near Kerteminde. General-Major Ernst Albrecht von Eberstein {{was in charge of the}} allied forces that had been left on Jutland, and was also moving towards Funen; landfall was made two days later without any Swedish resistance. Both Eberstein and Schack marched towards Odense, meeting up on November 12. So far, the invasion of <b>Funen</b> was going smoothly for the combined Danish and allied forces.|$|E
5|$|Danish country vicarages {{from this}} period tended {{to be built in}} the same style as farmhouses, though usually rather larger. A fine example is Kølstrup Vicarage near Kerteminde in {{north-eastern}} <b>Funen.</b> The house itself is a thatched half-timbered building with a large rectangular courtyard flanked by outhouses.|$|E
5|$|In Royal Prussia (Eastern Pomerania in {{contemporary}} Poland), Thorn had fallen already in December 1658, but Elbing and Marienwerder withstood. On 24 November, Sweden had to abandon <b>Funen</b> and Langeland after the {{defeat in the}} Battle of Nyborg. In January 1660, Sweden lost the Livonian fortress Mitau.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the allies}} {{managed to take}} {{possession}} over Jutland and the Swedish commander Philip of Sulzbach was forced into {{a long series of}} retreats. On May 19, 1659, the Swedes abandoned their last positions at Fredriksodde and took up positions at <b>Funen.</b> Less than two weeks later, on May 31, 1659 the first allied assault on <b>Funen</b> began with 9,000 soldiers. Against them stood 4,000 Swedes, considerably fewer, but consisting of battle-hardened veterans. The first attack was duly repelled. On June 26, a second attempt was made: the allies landed after heavy fire had pounded what was thought to be the Swedish positions. However, the Swedes had pulled back and returned unscathed with heavy fire of their own. The invaders were again thrown back. Before a third attempt could be made, a Swedish naval squadron under Owen Coxe managed to sink a large number of the invading fleet at the naval battle of Ebeltoft, and took 1,000 prisoners. In the end the allies had not succeeded to invade <b>Funen,</b> and a decision was taken to instead go back and attack Swedish Pomerania.|$|E
5|$|The Odense Bulldogs are a {{professional}} ice hockey team based in Odense. They {{play in the}} top Danish League Metal Ligaen, as the only team from <b>Funen.</b> In tennis, Tennis Club Odense is located near the Odense River. The country's largest tennis centre is due to open in Marienlyst in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Kold College is {{a privately}} run {{institution}} offering vocational courses in food, agriculture and gardening. Founded in 2004, after a merger between Datum Tekniske Skole and Gartnerskolen Søhus, it {{changed its name}} to Kold College in 2008. It also offers secondary education courses in the natural sciences. The college is named after Christen Kold who founded vocational schools on <b>Funen</b> in the mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|Odense also {{includes}} departments of the University College Lillebaelt headquartered in Vejle. The university {{is the result}} of a merger between several further education institutions on <b>Funen</b> and in Jelling, Vejle and Svendborg. UCL is currently undertaking comprehensive renovation of the buildings on Niels Bohrs Allé from the 1960s where it will concentrate its Odense interests. It intends to open University College Lillebælt Campus Odense in August 2014.|$|E
5|$|The harbour town of Svendborg in {{the south}} east of <b>Funen</b> {{dates back to the}} 13th century. Real {{prosperity}} emerged in the 19th century when shipbuilding and trade became important drivers. The town subsequently underwent a period of renovation with new brick and stone buildings lining its narrow streets. The old town has now become an important tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|Accessibility to Odense {{was greatly}} {{increased}} when the ferry service {{between the two}} main Danish islands, Zealand and <b>Funen,</b> {{was replaced by the}} Great Belt Bridge – opened in 1997 for rail traffic, 1998 for road traffic. When the bridge opened, it was the second longest suspension bridge in the world. Aarhus can be reached by train in 1 hour and 33 minutes while, thanks to the Great Belt Bridge, trains to Copenhagen can take as little as an hour and a quarter.|$|E
5|$|Odense Symphony Orchestra (Odense Symfoniorkester), one of Denmark's five {{regional}} orchestras, {{was formally}} established in 1946. The orchestra {{is based in}} Odense Concert Hall, which was inaugurated in 1982. Most of the orchestra’s concerts are given in the Carl Nielsen Hall, a seating capacity of 1,212 and a large 46-stops organ built by Marcussen & Son. First established in 1948, <b>Funen</b> Opera (Den Fynske Opera) was reopened in 1996 {{after a period of}} closure. It specializes in presenting contemporary operas in Danish.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{documentation}} of what inspired Nielsen {{to write his}} Fifth Symphony or {{when he started to}} write it, but it is generally understood that the first movement was composed in Humlebæk during the winter and spring of 1921. He stayed at his summer house at Skagen in the early summer. At the end of July he moved to a friend's home at Damgaard to compose the cantata Springtime on <b>Funen,</b> and was therefore only able to resume working on the second movement of the symphony in September, during his free time from his conducting work in Gothenburg.|$|E
5|$|To make it {{difficult}} for the enemy to track him he changed course frequently. Ranger operations depended on surprise, but it had clearly been lost. The clouds were thinning out and visibility was improving. Braham decided it was now a folly to continue and decided to head for home. While flying over <b>Funen</b> island he spotted a building with a big Swastika flag draped from a pole. A car was parked outside the entrance. Believing it might contain someone of importance, he dived to attack, strafing the building and destroyed the car.|$|E
5|$|Brought up by poor but musically talented {{parents on}} the island of <b>Funen,</b> he {{demonstrated}} his musical abilities at an early age. He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. He premiered his Op. 1, Suite for Strings, in 1888, at the age of 23. The following year, Nielsen began a 16-year stint as a second violinist in the prestigious Royal Danish Orchestra under the conductor Johan Svendsen, during which he played in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff and Otello at their Danish premieres. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Academy and continued to work there until his death.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, Odense remains the {{commercial}} hub of <b>Funen,</b> {{and has a}} notable shopping district with a diversity of stores. Several major industries {{are located in the}} city including the Albani Brewery and GASA, Denmark's major dealer in vegetables, fruits and flowers. The city is home to Odense Palace, erected by King Frederik IV who died there in 1730, the Odense Theatre, the Odense Symphony Orchestra, and the Hans Christian Andersen Museum, situated in the house that was the birthplace of Hans Christian Andersen. In sports, Odense has a number of football clubs including OB, BM, B1909, and B1913, the Odense Bulldogs professional ice hockey team, and the city also hosts the H.C. Andersen Marathon. Odense is served by Hans Christian Andersen Airport and Odense station, which lies on the line between Copenhagen and the Jutland peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The {{harsh winter}} of 1657/58 had forced the Dano-Norwegian fleet in port, and the Great and Little Belts {{separating}} the Danish isles {{from the mainland}} were frozen. After entering Jutland from the south, a Swedish army of 7,000 veterans undertook the March across the Belts; on 9 February 1658, the Little Belt was crossed and the island <b>Funen</b> (Fyn) captured within a few days, and soon thereafter Langeland, Lolland and Falster. On 25 February, the Swedish army continued across the Great Belt to Zealand with the Danish capital Copenhagen. Although only 5,000 men made it across the belts, the Swedish attack was completely unexpected; Frederick III was compelled to surrender and signed the disadvantageous Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658.|$|E
5|$|The {{strain of}} dual careers and {{constant}} separation {{from his wife}} led to an extended breach in his marriage. The couple began separation proceedings in 1916, and separation by mutual consent was granted in 1919. In the period 1916–22, Nielsen often lived on <b>Funen</b> retreating to the Damgaard and Fuglsang estates, or worked as a conductor in Gothenburg. The period was one of creative crisis for Nielsen which, coinciding with World War I, would strongly influence his Fourth (1914–16) and Fifth symphonies (1921–22), arguably his greatest works according to Fanning. The composer was particularly upset in the 1920s when his long-standing Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen was unable to undertake publication {{of many of his}} major works, including Aladdin and Pan and Syrinx.|$|E
5|$|Upon its {{founding}} in 1889, the Danish Football Association (DBU) inaugurated The Football Tournament contested by Copenhagen clubs only, though the winners are not considered official Danish champions. Upon {{the creation of the}} Copenhagen Football Association (KBU) in 1903, the administration of The Football Tournament was handed over to the newly founded regional football association, who went on to arrange yearly Copenhagen football championships. As the five other regional football associations emerged – namely Jutland FA (JBU), Zealand FA (SBU), <b>Funen</b> FA (FBU), Lolland-Falster FA (LFBU) and Bornholm FA (BBU) – they also started arranging championships for their own regions, parallel with the Copenhagen Championship.|$|E
5|$|While the {{movement}} had its greatest {{level of success}} in Sweden, {{there were a number}} of other important Danish proponents including Ivar Bentsen, Kaare Klint, Arne Jacobsen, Carl Petersen and Steen Eiler Rasmussen. Bentsen, with the assistance of Thorkild Henningsen, designed Denmark's first terraced houses in the Bellahøj district of Copenhagen. Very appropriately Klint, working with Bentsen, adapted the design of Frederiks Hospital to serve as the Danish Museum of Art & Design. Carl Petersen's main achievement was the Faaborg Museum built for collections of art from <b>Funen.</b> Steen Rasmussen is remembered above all for his town planning activities and for his contributions to the Dansk Byplanlaboratorium (Danish town planning laboratory).|$|E
5|$|From the 1840s, {{the city}} enjoyed {{a period of}} rapid {{expansion}} beyond its traditional boundaries, becoming Denmark's second largest city. The city gates were demolished in 1851 and soon afterwards development extended to the area south of the river. Glove production, which had begun in the 18th century, developed {{into one of the}} most important industries while the harbour facilities were further expanded. In 1853 Denmark's first modern water and gas works were opened in Odense. Commerce was further boosted by the building of a railway across <b>Funen</b> in 1865, and Odense became one of Denmark's largest rail junctions. All this provided an ideal basis for industrialisation, attracting a wide range of industries including iron and metals, textiles, and food and beverages. Separate areas of the city were devoted to increased industrial and residential expansion, and the population of the city began to grow markedly; by 1900 it had 35,000 inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Odense is {{the centre}} for media {{activity}} on <b>Funen,</b> and {{the hub of}} the regional network. Its principal newspaper is Fyens Stiftstidende, a daily broadsheet owned by Den Fynske Bladfond and published by Fyens Stiftstidende A/S, which was established on 3 January 1772. Until 1841 the newspaper was known as Kongelig Priviligerede Odense Adresse-Contoirs Efterretninger, and on 13 April 1993 the newspaper changed its 221-year-old tradition as a midday newspaper, to a morning paper. In 2013, it had an average circulation of 47,738, down from some 60,500 in 2005. The editor in chief, Per Westergård, chairs the board of the Centre for Journalism at the University of Southern Denmark, one of the two university journalism departments in Denmark. Denmark's largest university press, the University Press of Southern Denmark, is also based in Odense. It was founded in 1966 as Odense University Press (Odense Universitetsforlag), and its authors are mainly academics from the University of Southern Denmark.|$|E
25|$|Ærø is {{the only}} island among the larger Danish Baltic Sea islands that is not {{connected}} with a bridge, and road traffic is generally low. There are car ferry lines to Als, <b>Funen</b> and Langeland. Ærø also lies within a popular sailboat area, the South <b>Funen</b> Archipelago. A small airport with grassed runways is located near Marstal.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} capture the {{connections}} between Jutland and Zealand the Kriegsmarine landed more troops from the 198th Infantry Division at <b>Funen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Frederik Andreas Klokker (born 13 March 1983) is a Danish cricketer. Klokker is a left-handed batsman who {{fields as}} a wicket-keeper. He {{was born at}} Odense, <b>Funen</b> County.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century there was a large {{consolidation}} in the Danish brewing industry, where the larger city breweries typically bought the smaller countryside breweries. Albani was part of this development, buying smaller breweries in Odense and around the island of <b>Funen.</b> Later, when Albani had a near monopoly on beer distribution on <b>Funen,</b> Albani started acquiring breweries in other parts of the country; Sønderborg Bryghus, Bryggeriet Slotsmøllen, Baldur, and Maribo Bryghus, in each case, Albani taking control of the other company. Albani Breweries A/S merged with the Royal Unibrew group in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Søndersø Church in {{the north}} of <b>Funen</b> has a number of {{interesting}} wall paintings {{from the beginning of the}} 16th century, in particular those of the birth of Jesus and of the Virgin Mary.|$|E
25|$|Rynkeby Church in the {{northeast}} corner of <b>Funen</b> has a series of interesting paintings depicting angels playing a wide variety of musical instruments. They are exceptional in that they were painted after the Reformation.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time troops landed in Korsør and Nyborg, thereby cutting off the {{connections}} between <b>Funen</b> and Zealand. The troops in Korsør met no resistance and hurried towards Copenhagen which they reached at noon.|$|E
25|$|His {{works are}} in the {{collection}} of many Danish museums including the National Art Museum (Statens Museum for Kunst), the Hirschsprung Collection, and local art museums in Aarhus, Randers, Ribe, Amager, northern Jutland, Frederiksborg CountyFrederiksborg and <b>Funen.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{this time}} La Romana had 8,000 Spanish {{soldiers}} assembled on <b>Funen.</b> The badly outnumbered Danish contingent at Odense prudently left them alone. Between 9 and 11 August, the troops on <b>Funen</b> sailed across to Langeland where the 1st of Catalonia had overpowered the Danish garrison. La Romana's 9,000 Spanish troops waited on Langeland until 21 August when Keats arrived with three ships {{of the line}} and other warships. Keats transshipped the Division of the North to Gothenburg, Sweden where 37 naval transports awaited them. The squadron sailed to Santander where they deposited La Romana's troops by 11 October. The foot soldiers immediately prepared to fight while the cavalrymen marched to Extremadura where they were to collect horses.|$|E
25|$|Ferry {{services}} are {{run from the}} town of Hardeshøj on the island to Ballebro on the Jutland mainland, and {{from the town of}} Fynshav to Søby on the island of Ærø and to Bøjden on the island of <b>Funen.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} European route E20 crosses via road, the Oresund Line via railway. The {{construction of}} the Great Belt Fixed Link, connecting Zealand to <b>Funen</b> and thence to the Jutland Peninsula, and the Øresund Bridge have connected Central and Western Europe to Scandinavia by road and rail.|$|E
25|$|Eigtved {{returned}} to Denmark in 1735 after twelve years’ absence. Building construction {{was at a}} fever pitch, with construction of Christiansborg Palace having been begun three years earlier. He was named captain in the Engineer Corps, and named royal building master with supervisory responsibility for Jutland and <b>Funen</b> in 1735.|$|E
25|$|Albani Bryggerierne A/S (Eng.: Albani Breweries) is a brewery {{located in}} Odense, Denmark, {{and the vast}} {{majority}} of its customers live on the island of <b>Funen.</b> The brewery was founded by MPharm Theodor Schiøtz in 1859. In 2000, the brewery merged with Bryggerigruppen (now known as Royal Unibrew), a group of Danish regional breweries.|$|E
