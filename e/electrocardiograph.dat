5|$|Churchill did {{not support}} the government, however. In July, he had advised the King's legal counsel, Walter Monckton, against the divorce, but his advice was ignored. As soon as the affair became public knowledge, Churchill started to {{pressure}} Baldwin and the King to delay any decisions until parliament and the people had been consulted. In a private letter to Geoffrey Dawson, the editor of The Times newspaper, Churchill suggested that a delay would be beneficial because, given time, the King might fall out of love with Simpson. Baldwin rejected the request for delay, presumably because he preferred to resolve the crisis quickly. Supporters of the King alleged a conspiracy between Baldwin, Geoffrey Dawson, and Cosmo Gordon Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The royal physician Bertrand Dawson was possibly involved in a plan to force the prime minister to retire on the grounds of heart disease, but he eventually accepted, on the evidence of an early <b>electrocardiograph,</b> that Baldwin's heart was sound.|$|E

40|$|The DICOM {{standard}} {{is a set}} of rules that allows medical images to be digitally exchanged, viewed and archived. Since the year 2000 the widely used DICOM standard has included rules for diagnostic ECG waveforms, but for a long time, no ECG manufacturer had marketed <b>electrocardiographs</b> that support the DICOM waveform standard. It was spring 2006 before the first ECG manufacturer announced its adoption of the DICOM standard for diagnostic <b>electrocardiographs.</b> Diagnostic 12 lead DICOM ECGs sent to DICOM network servers can be reviewed on DICOM workstations in conjunction with typical DICOM images like cardiovascular angiographic x-ray and cardiac US images. In DICOM the clinician has access to comprehensive medical information that provides essential decision support for evaluating patients. The implementation of a vendor neutral DICOM solution allows healthcare providers to connect a variety of <b>electrocardiographs</b> from different vendors to DICOM servers and no proprietary ECG management system for ECG data will be required. 1...|$|R

40|$|Specifications {{recommended}} for <b>electrocardiographs</b> omit {{any reference to}} phase characteristics and place undue emphasis on an extended amplitude response. This does not, however, ensure faithful reproduction of the electrocardiogram and may result in less effective attenuation of unwanted noise than can be achieved with modern filters. The separate effects of phase and amplitude response on electrocardiographic signals were compared, and it was shown that distortion of the electrocardiogram by equipment with an inadequate phase response may cause changes resembling those seen in ischaemic heart disease. Case reports are presented in which distortion produced by commercial equipment impeded diagnosis. Specifications recommended as standard for <b>electrocardiographs</b> should be modified to include phase response and allow greater attenuation of frequencies below 0. 5 Hz...|$|R

2500|$|A {{more precise}} method of {{determining}} heart rate {{involves the use}} of an <b>electrocardiograph,</b> or ECG (also abbreviated EKG).

40|$|Background and Purpose: Automated {{measurements}} of electrocardiographic (ECG) intervals {{are widely used}} by clinicians for individual patient diagnosis and by investigators in population studies. We examined whether clinically significant systematic differences exist in ECG intervals measured by current generation digital <b>electrocardiographs</b> from different manufacturers and whether differences, if present, are dependent {{on the degree of}} abnormality of the selected ECGs. Methods Measurements of RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval were made blindly by 4 major manufacturers of digital <b>electrocardiographs</b> used in the United States from 600 XML files of ECG tracings stored in the US FDA ECG warehouse and released {{for the purpose of this}} study by the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium. Included were 3 groups based on expected QT interval and degree of repolarization abnormality, comprising 200 ECGs each from (1) placebo or baseline study period in normal subjects during thorough QT studies, (2) peak moxifloxacin effect in otherwise normal subjects during thorough QT studies, and (3) patients with genotyped variants of congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS). Results Differences of means between manufacturers were generally small in the normal and moxifloxacin subjects, but in the LQTS patients, differences of means ranged from 2. 0 to 14. 0 ms for QRS duration and from 0. 8 to 18. 1 ms for the QT interval. Mean absolute differences between algorithms were similar for QRS duration and QT intervals in the normal and in the moxifloxacin subjects (mean â‰¤ 6 ms) but were significantly larger in patients with LQTS. Conclusions Small but statistically significant group differences in mean interval and duration measurements and means of individual absolute differences exist among automated algorithms of widely used, current generation digital <b>electrocardiographs.</b> Measurement differences, including QRS duration and the QT interval, are greatest for the most abnormal ECGs...|$|R
