40|$|The <b>Flagfin</b> <b>mojarra,</b> Eucinostomus melanopterus, is {{a marine}} spawner whose young {{individuals}} {{are common in}} the Sine Saloum inverse estuary (Senegal). The species offers the opportunity to study both {{the use of the}} estuarine nursery resources and the impact of the particular environment of the inverse estuary on these resources. This will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the functioning of the nursery. We investigated the resources used by juvenile <b>Flagfin</b> <b>mojarra</b> by coupling stomach contents and stable isotopes methods. Young <b>Flagfin</b> <b>mojarra</b> feed on a wide range of invertebrates. Diet changed from copepods in the smallest size class (10 - 40 mm), to a range of invertebrates including amphipods, insect larvae, polychaetes and mollusc in the medium size class (up to 60 mm) and mainly polychaetes for individuals > 60 mm in size. In mangrove habitats with moderate salinity, the diet was dominated by polychaetes and decapod larvae (crabs) whereas in habitats with higher salinity, diet was dominated by amphipods. In very hypersaline areas with scarce mangroves, diet comprised benthic copepods, chironomid larvae and ostracods. This agreed with a clear change in delta C- 13 measured in fish sampled at downstream or upstream sites. Comparison with signatures of primary producers suggested that the local food web exploited by young <b>Flagfin</b> <b>mojarra</b> is mainly based on phytoplankton in the downstream mangrove area, and mainly on benthic microalgae in the upstream hypersaline area. As in many studies considering the food webs in mangrove, mangrove was not identified as a major contributor to the food web exploited by E melanopterus. This needs further investigation particularly because the exportation of estuarine materials to the sea is limited in an inverse estuary...|$|E
40|$|Shrimp {{trawling}} {{fishery in}} the Gulf of California captures {{a wide variety}} of non-target species of fish, crustaceans, and mollusks that are relatively unknown. The Pacific <b>flagfin</b> <b>mojarra</b> Eucinostomus currani is a frequently found species in these catches, nevertheless, nothing is currently known about its population dynamics. To contribute to the knowledge on this fish species, we studied the size structure, growth, mortality, and the recruitment pattern during the 2004 - 2005 seasons. A total of 6 078 mojarra were captured from 350 samples, with minimum and maximum lengths of 4. 5 cm and a maximum of 21. 0 cm. The average total length of the four major cohorts was 11. 4, 13. 7, 15. 6 and 18. 0 cm, corresponding to ages 0. 9, 1. 2, 1. 6 and 2. 2 years, respectively, being the most abundant the 1. 2 year-old group. The instant growth coefficient indicated moderate growth rates (K S= 0. 81 /year, K E= 0. 85 /year), corresponding to individuals living between 3. 5 to 3. 7 years. The estimated asymptotic lengths was Lâˆž= 21. 8 cm. In general, the population could be considered healthy: natural mortality (M= 1. 53 /year); total mortality (Z= 2. 73 /year); condition factor (K= 0. 01072); fishery mortality (F= 1. 2 / year) and exploitation rate (E= 0. 43 /year). The maximum reproduction period almost coincided with the closed season for shrimp fishing (March to August), thus we concluded that survival of the species is ensured because reproduction is indirectly protected.
