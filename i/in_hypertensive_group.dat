40|$|Background: Hypertension is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} and modifiable risk factor for atrial fibrillation. The pressure overload in the left atrium induces pathophysiological changes leading to alterations in contractile function and electrical properties. Objective: In this study {{our aim was to}} assess left atrial function in hypertensive patients to determine the association between left atrial function with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). Method: We studied 57 hypertensive patients (age: 53 ± 4 years; left ventricular ejection fraction: 76 ± 6. 7 %), including 30 consecutive patients with PAF and 30 age-matched control subjects. Left atrial (LA) volumes were measured using the modified Simpson’s biplane method. Three types of LA volume were determined: maximal LA(LAVmax), preatrial contraction LA(LAVpreA) and minimal LA volume(LAVmin). LA emptying functions were calculated. LA total emptying volume = LAVmax−LAVmin and the LA total EF = (LAVmax–LAVmin) /LAVmax, LA passive emptying volume = LAVmax− LAVpreA and the LA passive EF = (LAVmax–LAVpreA) /LAVmax, LA active emptying volume = LAVpreA−LAVmin and LA active EF = (LAVpreA–LAVmin) /LAVpreA. Results: The hypertensive period is longer <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> with PAF. LAVmax significantly increased <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> with PAF when compared to hypertensive group without PAF (p= 0. 010). LAAEF was significantly decreased <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> with PAF as compared to hypertensive group without PAF (p= 0. 020). A ’ was decreased in th...|$|E
40|$|Placenta {{is a vital}} organ for {{maintaining}} pregnancy and promoting normal foetal development. Foetal outcome is adversely influenced by pathological changes observed in placenta. Pregnancy complications like hypertension are reflected in placenta. The objective {{was to assess the}} morphology of placenta in normotensive and hypertensive pregnancies and to correlate the morphometric analysis with fetal parameters between the two groups. A Cross-sectional descriptive study was undertaken in the Department of Anatomy, Chalmeda Anandrao Institute of Medical Sciences, Karimnagar, Andhra Pradesh. Total 300 human placentae, 150 from hypertensive pregnancies were studied for the morphology and compared with 150 placentae from normal pregnancies. The morphometric parameters of placenta like weight, volume were significantly lower <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> compared to normal group. Placental weight and placental volume had significant correlation with the birth weight of new born.

40|$|The {{mortality}} and morbidity due to hypertension {{has increased in}} recent decades. So {{the present study was}} undertaken to assess the functioning of autonomic nervous system in relation with cardiovascular haemodynamics in essential hypertention patients as compared to normotensive subjects. For this purpose cold pressor test, postural stress test and valsalva maneuver were used as cardiovascular autonomic function tests. It was found that significant rise in systolic blood pressure <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> of both genders (p 0. 05) in females by cold pressor test. Postural stress test showed significant (p< 0. 05) fall in systolic blood pressure both in hypertensive males and females as compared to normotensive group. Valsalva ratio in hypertensive males is lower than that of normotensive group (p< 0. 001). So it can be concluded that there is definite cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in hypertensive patients as compared to normotensive subjects and which may have significance in maintenance of raised arterial blood pressure...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} α-hANP on {{systemic}} and renal hemodynamics including renal cortical blood flow (CBF) and renal function, {{were observed in}} mongrel dogs (N= 22) which were divided into the normotensive group (N= 10 dogs) and the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> (N= 12 dogs). The right renal artery was narrowed under intraperitoneal anesthesia with pentobarbital <b>in</b> the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> to make up renovascular hypertension. Electrodes of an electrolytic tissue blood flow meter were inserted into {{the inner and outer}} cortical layers of the left kidney. In addition, a Swan-Ganz catheter and a catheter for arterial blood pressure determination were inserted into the pulmonary artery and the origin of the Aorta. After stabilization of hemodynamics, α-hANP (0. 1 μg/kg or 2. 5 μg/kg) was given via the cubital vein into the animals. Results were as follows : heart rate (HR) did not change remarkably, mean aortic blood pressure (MBP) was remarkably reduced in both groups after high dose treatment. The degree of change was significantly greater <b>in</b> the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> than <b>in</b> the normotensive group. Cardiac output (CO) initially increased and decreased slowly after high dose treatment. Renal blood pressure (RBP) was reduced significantly in both groups after high dose treatment. Renal blood flow (RBF) increased significantly <b>in</b> the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> after high dose treatment. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urinary volume (UV) increased in both groups, but the degree of change was greater <b>in</b> the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> than <b>in</b> the normotensive group upon high dose treatment. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosteron concentration (ALD) decreased effectively upon high dose treatment. <b>In</b> the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group,</b> renal cortical blood flow increased effectively, but otherwise in normotensive group. The increase of CBF upon high dose treatment seems to be associated with reduced PRA. Upon high dose, the distribution of RBF was greater <b>in</b> the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group...</b>|$|R
40|$|Although {{evidence}} indicates that activation of presympathetic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) neurons contributes to the pathogenesis of salt-sensitive hypertension, the underlying cellular mechanisms are not fully understood. Recent {{evidence indicates}} that small conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ (SK) channels {{play a significant role}} in regulating the excitability of a key group of sympathetic regulatory PVN neurons, those with axonal projections to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM; i. e., PVN-RVLM neurons). In the present study, rats consuming a high salt (2 % NaCl) diet were made hypertensive by systemic infusion of angiotensin II (AngII), and whole cell patch-clamp recordings were made in brain slice from retrogradely labeled PVN-RVLM neurons. To determine if the amplitude of SK current was altered <b>in</b> neurons from <b>hypertensive</b> rats, voltage-clamp recordings were performed to isolate SK current. Results indicate that SK current amplitude (P < 0. 05) and density (P < 0. 01) were significantly smaller <b>in</b> the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group.</b> To investigate the impact of this on intrinsic excitability, current-clamp recordings were performed in separate groups of PVN-RVLM neurons. Results indicate that the frequency of spikes evoked by current injection was significantly higher <b>in</b> the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> (P < 0. 05 – 0. 01). Whereas bath application of the SK channel blocker apamin significantly increased discharge of neurons from normotensive rats (P < 0. 05 – 0. 01), no effect was observed <b>in</b> the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group.</b> <b>In</b> response to ramp current injections, subthreshold depolarizing input resistance was greater <b>in</b> the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> compared with the normotensive group (P < 0. 05). Blockade of SK channels increased depolarizing input resistance in normotensive controls (P < 0. 05) but had no effect <b>in</b> the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group.</b> On termination of current pulses, a medium afterhyperpolarization potential (mAHP) was observed in most neurons of the normotensive <b>group.</b> <b>In</b> the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group,</b> the mAHP was either small or absent. In the latter case, an afterdepolarization potential (ADP) was observed that was unaffected by apamin. Apamin treatment in the normotensive group blocked the mAHP and revealed an ADP resembling that seen <b>in</b> the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group.</b> We conclude that diminished SK current likely underlies the absence of mAHPs in PVN-RVLM neurons from hypertensive rats. Both the ADP and greater depolarizing input resistance likely contribute to increased excitability of PVN-RVLM neurons from rats with AngII-Salt hypertension...|$|R
40|$|Alterations of steroid {{metabolism}} in hypertension {{have been}} investigated with male and female normal and essential <b>hypertensive</b> subjects. Three <b>groups</b> of urinary metabolites have been quantitated: 1. androsterone, etiocholanolone and dehydroepiandrosterone (11 -deoxy- 17 -ketosteroids, C₁₉O₂-KS), 2. 11 -keto and 11 β-hydroxy androsterone and 11 -keto and 11 β-hydroxy etiocholanolone (11 -oxy- 17 -ketosteroids, C₁₉O₃-KS), and 3. 17 -ketogenic steroids (KGS) oxidised to etiocholanolone, 11 β-hydroxy androsterone and 11 β-hydroxy etiocholanolone. The urinary steroids were hydrolysed enzymatically, fractionated on silica gel columns and estimated as trimethyl silyl ether derivatives by gas liquid chromatography. [...] The following statistically {{significant differences were found}} in the excretion of metabolites by normal and hypertensive subjects. [...] 1. C₁₉O₂- 17 KS fraction: the excretion of etiocholanolone glucuronide and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was markedly reduced <b>in</b> the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> (P 0. 001), and the ratio of the 5 α/ 5 β-reduced metabolites was higher (P 0. 001). The latter suggested a relative deficiency of 5 β-reductase activity <b>in</b> the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group.</b> [...] 2. C₁₉O₃- 17 KS fraction: the excretion of the 5 α-reduced metabolites was higher (P 0. 01) <b>in</b> the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group,</b> and the 5 α/ 5 β ratio was also increased (P 0. 01), due to the increased 5 α-compounds. No significant reduction was found for the 5 β-reduced metabolites. [...] 3. KGS fraction: the excretion of both 5 α- and 5 β- reduced compounds was higher (P 0. 05) <b>in</b> the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group,</b> but the 5 β-compounds predominated in both normal and <b>hypertensive</b> <b>groups.</b> An increased excretion of 5 β-reduced metabolites may suggest that the 5 β-reductase activity is more active in the metabolism of the 17 -ketogenic steroids than C₁₉O₂- 17 KS. [...] The influence of the " 11 -oxy" function and corticosteroid "Side chain" on the relative 5 α- and 5 β- reductase enzyme activities and the influence of blood pressure has been discussed.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of sodium}} transport systems across the cell membrane has been poorly investigated in elderly hypertension. Sodium efflux driven by Na+/K+/Cl-cotransport activity was therefore investigated (using a novel NMR-spectroscopy method) in 5 elderly hypertensive males (mean age 78 +/- 5 years) and 5 normotensive controls (mean age 79 +/- 3 years). In order to exclude {{any change in}} cotransport activity secondary to metabolic abnormalities, both patients and controls were non-obese and had normal glucose and lipid metabolisms. The Na+/K+/Cl-cotransport evaluation was performed {{after three months of}} pharmacological wash-out, under a diet containing 120 mEq of Na+/day. The resulting data showed that Na+ efflux due to outward Na+/K+/Cl-cotransport was higher <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> than in the normotensive one (0. 50 +/- 0. 10 mmol Na+/l cells/hr. vs 0. 33 +/- 0. 03 mmol Na+/l cells/hr., respectively, p < 0. 05). Intracellular Na+ content was similar in both groups. At variance with previous data from the literature, our findings indicate that the Na+/K+/Cl-cotransport activity is elevated in elderly hypertensives...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Sympathetic nerve {{activity}} (SNA) undergoes physiological modulation by respiration but {{it remains}} unclear whether this process is altered by age and hypertension. Aims: To establish relationship between respiration and neural regulation of the cardiovascular system in aging and hypertension. Methods: Multiunit muscle SNA, BP, respiratory parameters and heart rate were recorded at rest in young and older healthy men and hypertensive patients, then repeated <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> after acute and long-term device-guided slow deep-breathing (SDB) training. Results: Muscle SNA was higher in older subjects but showed similar modulation by respiration in both age groups. In young acute SDB reduced SNA, with no effect on sympathetic and cardiac baroreflex sensitivity. The sympathoinhibition {{was not related to}} changes in baroreflex sensitivity, but it reflected increases in lung inflation afferent input and/or reduction in central respiratory-sympathetic coupling. Long-term SDB training inhibited muscle SNA in hypertensive patients and led to acute increase in heart rate variability and longer-term BP reduction. There were no changes in baroreflex sensitivity, cardiac structure/function or arterial stiffness in response to SDB training. Conclusions: The study provides new mechanistic insights into sympathetic regulatory pathways in hypertension and aging, which may help to establish anti-hypertensive strategy based on respiratory modulation...|$|E
40|$|Aim. Hypertension {{is one of}} {{the major}} risk factors for atherosclerosis.

A total of 80 individuals including 48 hypertensive and 32 normotensive individuals were included in the study. Groups were separated as obese and non-obese. Results. It was found out that the patient group had statistically higher systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein, high sensitive C reactive protein and microalbuminuria values than the control group while high density lipoprotein values were significantly lower (p< 0. 05). When adiponectin levels of the groups were compared, the patient group had an adiponectin level of 8. 66 ± 2. 75 µg/mL and the control group had an adiponectin level of 15. 01 ± 3. 99 µg/mL. There was a statistically significant difference between two groups (p< 0. 05). There was a negative correlation between adiponectin level and atherosclerotic risk factors. Conclusion. Adiponectin level was lower <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> when compared to the control group; there was also a significant association between adiponectin and atherosclerotic risk factors.

Catalase {{plays an important role in}} the disposal of hydrogen peroxide in erythrocyte and its activity was determined by CAT gene. The aims of this study were to investigate (1) the association between blood levels of antioxidant markers such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, oxidative stress-marker (malondialdehyde), and blood lead level and (2) the influence of genetic polymorphism of CAT gene (rs 769217) on change in blood pressure in general population of EGAT study project. This is a cross-sectional study of 332 normotensive, 432 prehypertensive, and 222 hypertensive male subjects.

40|$|Role of renal {{hemodynamics}} in the exaggerated natriuresis {{of essential}} hypertension. Extracellular fluid volume expansion {{is known to}} produce exaggerated natriuresis in essential hypertension. In order to assess the role of hemodynamic and intrarenal physical factors upon natriuretic response to central volume expansion, two hour water immersion (WI) experiments were made in six uncomplicated essential hypertensives and six normotensive healthy controls. Before and during WI we measured mean arterial pressure (MAP), urine flow (V/min), sodium (UNaV) and potassium (UKV) excretion, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and intrarenal (wedged) venous pressure (IRVP). In comparison with normotensive controls, the exaggerated natriuretic response in hypertensives (P < 0. 05 for UNaV during WI) was associated with an enhanced vasodilating response as demonstrated by a greater increase in ERPF (P < 0. 05) and by a more pronounced fall in calculated renal precapillary resistances (P < 0. 05). A more significant increase in IRVP was found <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> (P < 0. 05). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) did not change in either group during WI. MAP, unchanged in normotensives, was significantly reduced in hypertensives (P < 0. 05), while remaining in the hypertensive range.

40|$|Hypertension is a late {{manifestation of}} a {{syndrome}} consisting of dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, endocrine and renal dysfunction, obesity, left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. The aim {{of this research is}} to study the arterial compliance, renal, cardiac, endocrine and metabolic disorders as predictors of hypertension syndrome. Identification and treatment of these patients before the onset of high blood pressure may provide a better opportunity for reversing the disease progress and protecting patients from developing cardiovascular and renal diseases. This study was conducted on 130 cases, 50 patients with essential hypertension, 50 normotensive offspring of the hypertensive patients and 30 healthy subjects without family history of hypertension. All the subjects had electrocardiography, doppler and echocardiography examination for the measurement of arterial compliance, left ventricular diastolic function and left ventricular systolic function. Specific laboratory tests included lipid profile, serum insulin, plasma norepinephrine, plasma renin plasma homocysteine, plasma and urinary endothelin and urinary microalbumin. The {{results of the present study}} showed significant statistical increase of total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-c, microalbuminuria, insulin, norepinephrin, renin and homocysteine also significant statistical increase of left ventricular mass in hypertensive and offspring groups compared to control group and significant statistical decrease of HDL-c, urinary endothelin and of left ventricular diastolic function in hypertensive and offspring groups compared to control group. There is a significant increase of plasma endothelin <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> compared to offspring and control groups, while non significant statistical increase of plasma endothelin in offspring group compared to control group. While ejection fraction was statistically decreased <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> compared to offspring and control groups and there was no difference between offspring and control group. Comparing the hypertensive and offspring groups, there is a negative correlation between arterial compliance and total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-c, insulin, renin, norepinephrine, microalbuminuria, homocysteine, plasma endothelin, left ventricular mass and a positive correlation with left ventricular function. There is also a positive correlation between left ventricular mass and cholesterol, triglyceride. LDL-c, insulin, renin, norepinephrine, microalbuminuria, homocysteine, plasma endothelin and negative correlation with left ventricular function. The present study suggested that many of the hypertension syndrome as lipid abnormalities, changes in renal and endocrine functions, insulin resistance and changes in the structure and function of the left ventricle and of vascular smooth muscle precede the onset of high blood pressure and impaired homocysteine metabolism may be considered as one component of the hypertension syndrome.

40|$|Background: Arterial {{hypertension}} is {{an important}} risk factor for coronary artery disease and cardiovascular-induced morbidity and mortality. It can cause end-organ damages such as cerebrovascular diseases, renal failure, and congestive heart failure. On the other hand, because of elevated blood pressure and rapid blood flow, there {{is an increase in}} oxidation and peroxidation reactions. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the level of oxidized low-density lipoprotein and superoxide dismutase activity in sera of hypertensive patients. Methods: In this case-control study, 70 hypertensive patients without any other important diseases such as congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, liver disease, diabetes mellitus, renal disease, or thyroid disease were compared with 70 age-and gender-matched controls. The participants ' age range was from 30 to 75 years. Measurement of oxidized low-density lipoprotein in serum was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The activity of superoxide dismutase in serum was measured by enzymatic colorimetry method. Results: The patients ' mean age±SD was 52. 2 ± 14 years. The controls ' mean age±SD was 45 ± 13 years. The level of superoxide dismutase activity in the patients ' group was 100 ± 27 U/mL, and in the controls ’ group was 105 ± 11 U/mL.

40|$|Abstract—Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} occurs {{frequently}} {{in patients with}} drug-resistant hypertension. The factors accounting for this observation, however, are unclear. Both conditions demonstrate clinical features suggestive of extracellular fluid volume overload. The aims {{of this study were}} to examine whether the spontaneous overnight fluid shift from the legs to the upper body is associated with obstructive sleep apnea <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> subjects and whether its magnitude is greater in drug-resistant hypertension. Leg fluid volume and the circumference of the calf and neck were measured before and after sleep <b>in</b> drug-resistant <b>hypertensive</b> (n 25) and controlled hypertensive (n 15) subjects undergoing overnight polysomnography. The severity of obstructive sleep apnea was greater <b>in</b> the drug-resistant <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> than <b>in</b> the controlled <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> (apnea-hypopnea index: 43. 05. 4 versus 18. 14. 2 events per hour of sleep; P 0. 02, case-mix adjusted). In both groups, the apnea-hypopnea index strongly related to the amount of leg fluid volume displaced (R 20. 56; P 0. 0001), although the magnitude of change was greater <b>in</b> the drug-resistant <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> (346. 724. 1 versus 175. 831. 3 mL; P 0. 01, propensity-score adjusted).

40|$|Introduction & Objectives: Previous {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that induction of two kidney-one clip (2 K 1 C) Goldblatt hypertension in rats eliminates hypertensive response after inactivating of the Central Nucleus of the Amygdala (CA). The present study investigated the possibility of alteration in local Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) activity in CA after hypertension induction and evaluation of cardiovascular response to Renin Substrate (RS) microinjection into CA in Wistar rats. Materials & Methods: Clamps {{were placed on the}} left renal arteries to induce 2 K 1 C Goldblatt hypertension. A similar surgery procedure without clipping was done in sham group. Rats were studied eight weeks after surgery. The Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were measured directly with indwelling arterial cannula under urethane anesthesia. Rats received bilateral cannulation of the CA for RS microinjection. After bilateral microinjection of consecutive doses of RS (0. 5 µL- 0. 1, 1 & 10 µM) saline and pretreatment of losartan (10 µM), saralasin(1 nM) or captopril(10 µM) before RS into CA, MAP and HR measured and compared between groups. Results: Bilateral microinjection of consecutive doses of RS into CA increased MAP and HR significantly greater <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> in comparison with normotensive ones (P< 0. 001). Bilateral microinjection of saralasin and losartan into the CA of Goldblatt hypertensive rats produced significant decrease in MAP and HR from baseline levels. After pretreatment of saralasin, losartan and captopril effects of 1 µM RS microinjection into CA of all groups were inhibited. Conclusion: These results are functionally demonstration of cardiovascular effects of RS after microinjection into CA and that effects have increased after 2 K 1 C hypertension induction. This process may contribute in Goldblatt hypertension pathogenesis. Increased Angiotensin II (AngII) receptors or accelerated proteolytic process of RS to Angiotensin I and II may alter RS microinjection into CA outcome...|$|E

Methods A hundred patients with essential hypertension and a hundred healthy control subjects, compatiblein age and gender were included in study. All of them were subjected to clinical, electrocardiographical,pschycological and laboratory examination. Results Hypertensive patients had significantly shorter average RR interval, and faster heart rate comparedto control subjects (758, 7 ± 29, 3 ms vs. 824, 9 ± 38, 4 ms; p < 0, 001). The average variability ofthe heart rate was significantly lower in hypertensive than in healthy controls (3, 85 ± 1, 57 % vs. 4, 54 ± 2, 4 %; p< 0, 01). The major impact on variability of the heart rate in peaceful and deep breathing comesfrom sistolic and diastolic blood pressure, the left ventricule mass, diastolic dysfunction of the heart,the size of left atrium, the duration of hypertnesion, blood cholesterol levels and blood triglicerid levels. The most significant negative correlation is between variability of heart rate and the duration of hypertension(beta = - 0, 291). In both hypertensive patients and control group the behavioral type A is morefrequent than type B. <b>In</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> there is a significant impact of all independent variablesby Bortner on the heart rate variabiliy in peaceful breathing (R = 0, 50).

40|$|Background: Hypertension {{and obesity}} are {{risk factors of}} {{cardiovascular}} disease. The association between C-reactive protein, homocysteine, microalbuminuria and cardiovascular risk have been debated for decades. Resistin is a newly discovered adipocyte derived cytokine. In the current study we planned to investigate the relation of resistin to these probable cardiovascular risk factors and obesity <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> patients. Materials and Methods: The study population consisted of 42 non-obese and 42 obese hypertensive females. After making comparisons between C-reactive protein, homocysteine, microalbuminuria and resistin in the two groups, we also sought correlations between all parameters in non-obese and obese groups.

40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the relation of brachial artery intima-media thickness (IMT) with endothelial function and left ventricular mass (LVM). Methods: Fifty four stage I-II hypertensive patients according to JNC VII who were not taking any medication and 27 age and sex-matched healthy controls were included to this cross-sectional observational study. IMT {{was measured by the}} same radiologist who was unaware of the patient’s clinical status by using high resolution ultrasound machine. Endothelial function was evaluated by flow mediated dilation (endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, FMD). LVM was calculated by using Devereux method. LVM index (LVMI) was obtained by dividing LVM to body surface area. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare continuous variables, qualitative variables were compared by Chi-square test and the relations of parameters were evaluated by multiple linear regression analysis. Results: Both groups (hypertensive and control) were similar with respect to age, sex, left ventricular ejection fraction. IMT was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> (0. 43 ± 0. 09 vs 0. 33 ± 0. 06 mm; p< 0. 001). FMD values were also significantly different between hypertensive and control groups (4 ± 4 % vs 13 ± 12 %; p< 0. 001). LVMI was significantly different between hypertensive and control groups LVMI (124 ± 5 vs 99 ± 6 gr/m 2, p= 0. 002). The correlation between IMT and FMD (r= 0. 260; p= 0. 026) and IMT and LVMI (r = 0. 348; p= 0. 004) were statistically significant.

The patients and control group were subjected to routine investigations, assay of serum cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and assay of ACE gene I/D polymorphism using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results of the study showed that the frequency of DD,ID and II genotypes were 42 %, 44 % and 14 % respectively <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>group</b> and 30 %, 50 % and 14 % respectively in control group with significantly higher frequency of DD genotype in patients as compared to the control group (p< 0. 05). There was a significant association between DD genotype and hypertension, as there was significant increase in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with DD genotype as compared to other genotypes. Serum cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL ­C levels showed significant increase in patients as compared to the control group (P < 0. 001, P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 001 : respectively) Also, serum Cholesterol and LDL-C levels showed significant increase in patients with DD and ID genotypes as compared to II genotype, while triglycerides and HDL-C didn't show differences between the three genotypes. It was concluded that the DD genotype of ACE gene showed significantly higher frequency among patients with essential hypertension as compared to the normal subjects and that DD genotype was associated with significantly higher blood pressure as compared to ID and II genotypes. Also, DD genotype was associated with significantly higher serum cholesterol and LDL-C as compared to II genotype.
