The study utilized the current database of land-use, topography, stream network, soil, and weather data available to the State and Federal agencies. Methods for collecting, evaluating, and formatting watershed data for model input are described. The study demonstrated that the lumped parameter model {{may be used to}} characterize the hydrology and water quality of Chicod Creek. Hydrology predictions were within I 0 /o of the measured data. Predicted mean <b>daily</b> flow <b>weighted</b> <b>concentration</b> compared well with the measured data.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To study whether air {{contaminants}} in sawmills can induce acute {{changes in the}} upper and lower airways of previously non-exposed subjects. METHODS: Nineteen healthy volunteers were examined to find the concentration of interleukin 6 (IL- 6) in nasal lavage fluid and lung function before and after five hour exposure to dusts and fumes generated in a sawmill where timber from Scots pine was sawed. When exposed, the subjects had respirators with and without a particle filter. RESULTS: The median for <b>daily</b> time <b>weighted</b> average <b>concentration</b> of total dust for subjects with respirators without a filter was 0. 13 mg/m 3, which was significantly higher than the median of 0. 04 mg/m 3 for subjects who had respirators with a filter. The median for the concentration of IL- 6 in the nasal lavage fluid increased after exposure from 0. 5 to 5. 9 pg/ml in subjects with respirators without a particle filter (P < 0. 05). The increase of the concentration of IL- 6 was significantly correlated with the dust concentration. A decrease in transfer factor of the lung was significantly correlated with <b>daily</b> time <b>weighted</b> average <b>concentrations</b> of terpenes. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that healthy volunteers, exposed to air {{contaminants in}} a sawmill, show a slight inflammatory reaction.

Repeated heavy {{applications}} of broadcast broiler litter can increase nutrient nmoff from pastures. Rotational stocking of cattle, {{as compared to}} continuous stocking, {{may be useful in}} decreasing surface nutrient runoff because of better manure. distribution and more uniform forage accumulation to act as filters and trap nutrients.

Runoff was analyzed for dissolved reactive P (DRP) and total Kjeldahl P (TKP). Grazing method had no effect (P> 0. 10) on surface runoff quality or quantity. The average flow <b>weighted</b> <b>concentration</b> of DRP for both stocking treatments was 5. 1 mg P L- 1 for the first year and 8. 2 mg P L- 1 for the second year {P< 0. 10). The flow <b>weighted</b> <b>concentration</b> of TKP was 6. 8 mg P L- 1 for the first year and 12. 8 mg P L- 1 for the second year (P< 0. 10).

40|$|The {{uncertainties}} {{associated with}} stream nutrient transport estimates are frequently overlooked and {{the sampling strategy}} is rarely if ever investigated. Indeed, the impact of sampling strategy and estimation method on the bias and precision of stream phosphorus (P) transport calculations is little understood despite {{the use of such}} values in the calibration and testing of models of phosphorus transport. The objectives of this research were to investigate the variability and uncertainty in the estimates of total phosphorus transfers at an intensively monitored agricultural catchment. The Oona Water which is located in the Irish border region, is part of a long term monitoring program focusing on water quality. The Oona Water is a rural river catchment with grassland agriculture and scattered dwelling houses and has been monitored for total phosphorus (TP) at 10 min resolution for several years (Jordan et al, 2007). Concurrent sensitive measurements of discharge are also collected. The water quality and discharge data were provided at 1 hour resolution (averaged) and this meant that a robust estimate of the annual flow <b>weighted</b> <b>concentration</b> could be obtained by simple interpolation between points. A two-strata approach (Kronvang and Bruhn, 1996) was used to estimate flow <b>weighted</b> <b>concentrations</b> using randomly sampled storm events from the 400 identified within the time series and also base flow concentrations. Using a random stratified sampling approach for the selection of events, a series ranging from 10 through to the full 400 were used, each time generating a flow weighted mean using a load-discharge relationship identified through log-log regression and monte-carlo simulation. These values were then compared to the observed total phosphorus concentration for the catchment. Analysis of these results show the impact of sampling strategy, the inherent bias in any estimate of phosphorus concentrations and the uncertainty associated with such estimates. The estimates generated using the full time series underestimate the flow <b>weighted</b> mean <b>concentration</b> of total phosphorus. This work compliments other contemporary work in the area of load estimation uncertainty in the UK (Johnes, 2007).

Results show no correlation between excess reserves and interbank rate movements, even though a Granger causality test shows that in the absence of money market intervention, the level of excess reserves may determine both the level of and changes in the interbank rate. There is also highly significant causality from Central Bank intervention to the target interbank rate, but no correlation between the two. Furthermore, {{there is no evidence of}} correlation or causation between excess reserves and interbank rates when the interbank rate falls outside of the target.

It is therefore of importance to ascertain the intrinsic characteristics of receiver DCBs, preferably in the context of new-generation GNSS. In this contribution, we present a method that enables time-wise retrieval of between-receiver DCBs (BR-DCBs) from dual-frequency, code-only measurements collected by a pair of co-located receivers. This method is applicable to the US GPS as well as to a new set of GNSS constellations including the Chinese BeiDou, the European Galileo and the Japanese QZSS. With the use of this method, we determine the multi-GNSS BR-DCB time-wise estimates covering a time period of up to 2 years (January 2013 –March 2015) with a 30 -s time resolution for five receiver-pairs (four zero and one short baselines).

We find that in the sample period average liquidity costs rose to over 100 bp in large DAX and to 460 bp in large SDAX positions. Over the last 5. 5 years, liquidity has equally improved across all order sizes. Liquid position sizes, however, suffered less badly during the recent sub-prime crises, which represents another type of the flight-to-liquidity. As the basis for further theoretical analysis, we find that trends in liquidity levels and inefficiencies in liquidity prices of large positions generate non-normality in the liquidity distribution. We also show that - {{as a rule of}} thumb - liquidity of an order size relative to market value and transaction volume is constant across stocks and time.

No signs of toxicity were apparent throughout the period of treatment. Behavioral evaluation was performed 24 hours {{after the end of}} the treatment.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a phytotherapeutic intervention comprising a combination of Hypericum perforatum (St. John&# 039;s wort) and Vitex agnus-castus (Chaste tree/berry) in the management of menopausal symptoms. Design: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel trial was performed over 16 weeks in 100 eligible late-perimenopausal or postmenopausal women experiencing hot flushes and other menopausal symptoms. Herbal combination therapy or placebo tablets were administered twice daily. The primary endpoint was hot flush episodes. Secondary endpoints included Greene Climacteric Scale scores, Hamilton Depression Inventory scores, and Utian Quality of Life Scale scores. Results: Ninety-three women completed the study. Data analysis on an intent-to-treat basis found {{no significant differences between the}} two groups for any of the endpoints. Analyses performed at interim data time points revealed no significant differences at week 4, 8, or 12 for <b>daily</b> <b>weighted</b> flushes or scores on the Greene Climacteric Scale or Hamilton Depression Inventory. However, significant improvements across the treatment phase were observed in both the placebo and active treatment groups for these endpoints. No significant change was found for either group on quality of life. Conclusion: The herbal combination of H. perforatum and V. agnus-castus was not found to be superior to placebo for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. The herbal combination was well tolerated with no significant adverse events noted in the short term. Robust findings from quality studies such as this are important for informing the community, healthcare providers, and regulatory authorities...|$|R
40|$|During July 2000 we used an {{electronic}} personal dosimeter (X- 2000) and a biological dosimeter (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt: Biofilm) {{to characterize the}} UV radiation exposure of arctic field scientists involved in biological and geological fieldwork. These personnel were working at the Haughton impact structure on Devon Island (75 °N) in the Canadian High Arctic under a 24 h photoperiod. During a typical day of field activities under a clear sky, the total <b>daily</b> erythemally <b>weighted</b> exposure, as measured by electronic dosimetry, was up to 5. 8 standard erythemal dose (SED). Overcast skies (typically 7 – 8 okta of stratus) reduced exposures by a mean of 54...|$|R
40|$|This study sole {{objective}} is to estimate the wet deposition in Khartoum State. Eleven samples were collected from seven rain events during 2007 rain season, from three different stations; first class residential area, second class unpaved area and industrial area. The measurement of the wet deposition pollutants carried out for Dissolve Oxygen, pH, and main contaminants BOD, COD, Ammonia, Carbonate, Nitrates, Sulphate and Total Phosphorus. The accuracy of the analysis checked with charge balance estimation, the high resulted percentage difference was according to significant missing measurements. The calculation of the <b>weighted</b> average <b>concentrations</b> showed that the southern wind is loaded with high concentration of SO 4 2 -, CO 3 2 - and NO 3 1 -. Also the average <b>weighted</b> <b>concentration</b> analyzed by MINTEQA 2 program to estimate the percentage difference, species and pH which confirmed the calculated charge balance. The loads of the concentrations were used to perceive the contributions of different land uses to the air pollution and the resulted loads in kg per Km 2 were 196. 9 SO 4 2 -, 57. 8 NO 3 1 -, 429 CO 3 2 -, 2. 6 TP, 329. 8 NH 3, 190 COD and 170 BOD. Moreover the analysis were acquiescent with the variation of wet deposition pollutants concentrations according to rainfall conditions like time of the day, the surrounded area and heights besides the variability of the concentrations within the single precipitation events. Most of the precipitation samples were collected from urban centers and away from major point sources of pollution, to provide more regional/national perspective on precipitation chemistry. The results acquired from this thesis assure {{that there is no}} acidic deposition in Khartoum State, high amount of suspended solids in the state due to unpaved streets, and high concentrations of the wet deposition pollutants in the industrial areas which needs environmental management and restricted regulations to maintain the air clean. The requirement of pilot studies to focus on the wet deposition variation in Khartoum State is essential as the urbanization and industrial revolution are certainly going to affect the rain quality...|$|R
