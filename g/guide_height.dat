40|$|A Radial Guide Field Matching Method (RGFMM) is used {{to analyse}} a {{circular}} array antenna consisting of one active monopole surrounded by a concentric array of passive monopoles terminated in arbitrary loads. An equivalent admittance matrix for this antenna system is determined to study the input admittance of the active monopole when the peripheral elements are terminated in open or short circuits. It is shown {{that the effect of}} the radial <b>guide</b> <b>height</b> in RGFMM on the input admittance of the active element becomes negligible when the guide's height is in the order of one wavelength. RGFMM results are compared with Free Space Method of Moment (FSMoM) results for a small switched-beam array of 7 monopoles. Good agreement is noted. 4 page(s...|$|E
50|$|Bandaje falls {{is formed}} by a {{tributary}} of Netravathi river and {{is located in a}} remote area of western ghats, which can be reached through trekking with the help of <b>guides.</b> <b>Height</b> of waterfalls is about 200 feet. The path to Bandaje falls from Valambra goes through thick ever green forest which ends in grass lands and those who trek without guide are likely to be lost in forest. To visit Bandaje Falls, there are two different routes. If you are travelling via Mangalore - Ujire, it is located 25 km from Ujire. Travel 6 km from Ujire towards Charmadi Ghat, take left at Somanthadka, travel for another 6 km, then take a right turn, and travel for 2 km to find a village named kadirudyavara, from where you can have the remote view of the Falls. However, you have to trek for 10 more km from Kadirudyavara to reach the falls. Locally this falls is called as Bandaje Arbi, where Arbi means falls in Tulu language. Permission from Belthangady wildlife range office, Kudremukh national park is required to trek to Bandaje falls.|$|R

40|$|Design of an ultra-compact {{polarization}} splitter (PS) based on silicon-on-insulator platform is presented. The design incorporates two simply coupled identical silicon nanowires, {{which can be}} easily fabricated by using standard Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor technology and fully compatible with standard active silicon photonics platforms. It is shown here that a low-loss, 17. 90 μm long compact PS, and wide bandwidth over the entire C-band can be achieved. Important waveguide design parameters such as the <b>guide</b> width, <b>height,</b> and separation between them have been optimized, and modal birefringence and wavelength dependence have been calculated by using a full-vectorial H-Field finite element method. The optical power transfer characteristics have been calculated by using a rigorous least squares boundary residual method...|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} of LiNbO 3 ridge waveguides etched by {{a mixture of}} HF and HNO 3 using chromium (Cr) stripes as masks is reported. Smooth etched surfaces are obtained by adding some ethanol into the etchant. Under-etching is nearly avoided by annealing the sample with the Cr masks before the wet etching process. Low-loss monomode ridge <b>guides</b> with a <b>height</b> of up to 8 pm and a width between 4. 5 and 7. 0 mu m are demonstrated. As an example, the propagation losses in a 6. 5 -mu m-wide and 8 -mu m-high structure are 0. 3 dB/cm for transverse-electric and 0. 9 dB/cm for transverse-magnetic polarization, respectively, at 1. 55 -mu m wavelength...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSurface {{acoustic}} wave (SAW) sensors are electromechanical devices that exploit the piezoelectric effect to induce elastic (acoustic) waves which {{are sensitive to}} small perturbations: for example specific binding and recognition of disease biomarkers. Shear horizontal surface {{acoustic wave}}s (SH-SAWs) are particularly suited to biosample analysis as the wave is not completely radiated and lost into the liquid medium (e. g., blood, saliva) as is the case, for example, in a device implementing Rayleigh waves. Here, using 3 D finite element analysis (FEA) the nature of waves launched on a particular quartz device is investigated {{with respect to the}} cut of the quartz, the addition of gold guiding layers, and the addition of other linear elastic materials of contrasting acoustic properties. It is demonstrated that 3 D FEA analysis showing the device's frequency shift with added <b>guiding</b> layer <b>height</b> reveals a proportional relationship in agreement with the Sauerbrey equation from perturbation theory. It is directly shown, given certain device parameters and a gold guiding layer, that shear horizontally polarized waves are launched on the surface with a dominant mode frequency around 250 MHz. This would be an appropriate biosensing mode in Point of Care (POC) testing for the particular properties of certain disease biomarkers delivered via a liquid medium...|$|R
40|$|A new leaky-wave antenna is {{presented}} that possesses many desirable features and {{is suitable for}} application to both the millimeter-wave and microwave ranges. These desirable features, {{some of which are}} unusual, include a simple configuration, a wide flexibility in the range of available beamwidths, the ability to control the beamwidth and the direction of the beam essentially independently, and negligible cross polarization at all scan angles. The antenna structure consists of a parallel-plate stub <b>guide</b> of small <b>height,</b> less than a half wavelength, located off center on the top of rectangular waveguide. The beamwidth is easily controlled from very wide to very narrow by adjusting the stub width or location. The article presents the principle of operation and the theory, employing a new transverse equivalent network that is accurate, but also simple, so that it permits rapid and inexpensive numerical calculations...|$|R
60|$|I boiled a {{thermometer}} and took an altitude, with a most curious result: THE SUMMIT WAS NOT AS HIGH AS THE POINT ON THE MOUNTAINSIDE WHERE I HAD TAKEN THE FIRST ALTITUDE. Suspecting that I {{had made an}} important discovery, I prepared to verify it. There {{happened to be a}} still higher summit (called the Gorner Grat), above the hotel, and notwithstanding the fact that it overlooks a glacier from a dizzy height, and that the ascent is difficult and dangerous, I resolved to venture up there and boil {{a thermometer}}. So I sent a strong party, with some borrowed hoes, in charge of two chiefs of service, to dig a stairway in the soil all the way up, and this I ascended, roped to the <b>guides.</b> This breezy <b>height</b> was the summit proper--so I accomplished even more than I had originally purposed to do. This foolhardy exploit is recorded on another stone monument.|$|R
40|$|Several leaky-wave antennas {{have been}} {{described}} {{in recent years that}} possess excellent properties, and they all have in common a parallel-plate stub <b>guide</b> of finite <b>height</b> as part of the cross section. For taller stubs and for larger leakage rates (wider radiated beams), some interesting new exotic interactions occur due to coupling between the desired leaky mode and another leaky mode, which is a modification of the “channel-guide” mode. Although we have described such coupling behavior briefly previously, this basic new feature (the coupling between two leaky (complex) modes) is not generally known, and is discussed here in more detail and in a more general context. In addition to a broad qualitative discussion, numerical results are presented for structures based on NRD guide and on stub-loaded rectangular guide. We believe that these effects are universal to all leaky-wave structures that possess a finite stub height in the cross section, so that the discussion here serves as a model for what to expect for other structures...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design and}} performance of a 210 - 280 GHz SlS heterodyne receiver built for use on the Maxwell Telescope. The mixer utilises a lead alloy SIS tunnel junction mounted in 4 : 1 reduced height rectangular waveguide, and is tuned with a backshort in 2 : 1 reduced <b>height</b> <b>guide.</b> The receiver has a receiver noise temperature of < 200 K (DSB) across the RF band from 210 - 270 GHz, with a best noise temperature measured in the laboratory of 113 K (DSB) at 231 GHz. A prototype version of this receiver was successfully operated on the telescope in May 1989. By direct intercalibration with a Schottky diode receiver we deduced a best receiver noise temperature of 140 K (DSB) at 245 GHz. Discrepancies between this figure and that derived from broad band thermal load calibration {{are discussed in the}} accompanying paper (Little et al., 1992, this issue) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the imaging}} process, the {{deformation}} {{of the plate}} caused by {{the structure of the}} drum, finally affecting the quality of the plate, we analyze and optimize the structure of the drum using the finite element method. Selecting the larger three factors affecting the plate deformation as the design variables, and taking minimizing the maximum deformation of the plate as the objective function, we establish the optimization model {{of the structure of the}} drum. We use the APDL parametrization language to create the geometric model and finite element model of the drum, and select the contact element to simulate the relationship between the plate and the surface of the drum, and use ANSYS software to optimize the optimization model. It is shown form the result that: the minimum of the maximum deformation of the drum getting from the 8 th iteration is 0. 0021535 mm, significantly reduced compared with the initial value 0. 002864 mm. At this point, the internal diameter D 2 of the drum is 300. 04 mm, the groove width L 2 is 14. 323 mm, the external diameter of groove height D 3 is 338. 44 mm. It indicates that that the smaller the internal diameter of the drum and the narrower the guide groove on the drum surface are, the smaller the maximum deformation of the plate is, and the <b>guide</b> groove <b>height</b> has little influence on the deformation. The results can be provided as theoretical reference for the design of CTP imaging drum, which has popularization and application value...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design of}} several novel, passive waveguide devices being developed for the high-power rf distribution system of the Next Linear Collider [1]. This system allows the combined power of several klystrons to be directed, by means of drive phase manipulation, to different accelerator feeds at different times during each pulse. The desire {{to reduce the amount}} of required low-loss, circular-waveguide delay line has led to the present multi-moded scheme, in which different modes travel through the same waveguide to different destinations. Components are needed for combining, launching, splitting, and directing hundreds of megawatts at X-band. For simplicity, manipulations are done primarily in overmoded rectangular <b>guide,</b> with the <b>height</b> increased to improve power-handling capacity. Features that invite breakdown, such as coupling slots and h-plane septa, are avoided. The components described here utilize TE 10 and TE 20 as operating modes. They include a four-input superhybrid, a mode-selective extractor, mode–preserving bends, a rectangular mode converter, and a rectangular-tocircular taper [2], which converts between the above modes and the circular TE 11 and TE 01 modes, respectively. ...|$|R
6000|$|Friedrich himself, {{without waiting}} for the rear of his force, and some while before this mist fell (as I judge), is pushing forward, [...] "a miller lad for his guide," [...] across to Hennersdorf,--Katholisch-Hennersdorf, a long straggling Village, eight or ten miles off, and itself two miles long,--where he understands the Saxons are. Miller lad <b>guides</b> us, over <b>height</b> and hollow, with his best skill, at a brisk pace;--through one hollow, where he has known the cattle pasture in summer time; but which proves impassable, and mere {{quagmire}}, at this season. No getting through it, you unfortunate miller lad (GARCON DE MEUNIER). Nevertheless, we did find passage through the skirts of it: nay this quagmire proved the luck of us; for the enemy, trusting to it, had no outguard there, never expecting us on that side. So that the vanguard, Ziethen and rapid Hussars, made an excellent thing of it. Ziethen sends us word, That he has got {{into the body of}} Hennersdorf,--"found the Saxon Quartermaster quietly paying his men;"--that he, Ziethen, is tolerably master of Hennersdorf, and will amuse the enemy till the other force come up.|$|R
40|$|The flow {{redistribution}} in the axial stage {{through the}} stator axis blade deformation can create favorable conditions for raising stage efficiency and combined actions for axial compressor elements especially in ambient conditions. For this purpose, the axis deformation {{impact on the}} gas-dynamic stability margin and the coefficient of efficiency of axial compressor has been numerically investigated. The influence of guide vane (GV) axis was considered with invariable rotor blades and different variants of stator. The GV axis form was changed on the {{arc of a circle}} in the range of ± 15 % guide vane height in circumferential direction and in the axial direction in the range ± 10 % of <b>guide</b> vane <b>height,</b> increments ± 2. 5 %. As an object, for investigation was chosen a numerical 3 D model of transonic stage of axial compressor with the following values of basic parameters: circumferential speed in the rotor blade trips of 345 m/s, relative diameter of the hub being 0. 7, and coefficient of discharge being 0. 5. The stage was profiling by classic low Cu*r=const. Rotor and stator profiles for all variants under investigation were the same in the same radii. As to initial radial axis guide vane, the losses of total pressure in stator become substantially less throughout the height of blade in case there is a guide vane axis bending in axial direction in line of flow. Bending of the axis in the circumferential direction against the rotation leads to reducing total pressure losses especially in hub and shroud regions, and in the flow core there is no change. In future, the effects of a tangent pitch and a slanting flow can be of interest in case of the simultaneous bending in both directions, as well as when studying the influence of bending of the guide vanes, which are a part of a sector of stages and a multi-stage compressor {{in a wide range of}} operating conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Mid-parental heights {{are widely}} used to help assess an {{individual}} child's growth. However, the methods in use vary, and most make no allowance for extremes of parental height. This study aimed to examine the actual distribution of parental heights in a survey population and the relation with their children's heights. The heights of 419 representatively sampled children aged 8 - 9 years were compared with their reported mid-parental heights, all expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS). These confirmed previous predictions that 90 % of the children's heights would fall within 1. 5 SDS (approximately two centile spaces) of their mid-parental heights. However, where parents were unusually tall or short, their children were relatively less tall or short, respectively, and the mid-parental height was a poor predictor of attained height. A simple calculator for expected height centile is described that automatically adjusts for this regression to the mean. Of 13 children below the second centile for height, eight were within two centile spaces (90 % range) of their mid-parental height SDS. However, when allowance was made for regression to the mean, only three of 13 were within the 90 % range. Although mid-parental height provides a useful <b>guide</b> to expected <b>height</b> centile for children and parents of average stature, it can be misleading when used to assess short children. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Underweight {{in human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) -infected people on antiretroviral therapy (ART) complicates the management of HIV infection and contributes to mortality, whereas overweight {{increases the risk of}} cardiovascular disease (CVD). Aim: The study determined weight status and associated factors in people with HIV infection receiving ART. Setting: Rural primary health care clinics in Dikgale, Limpopo province, South Africa. Methods: A cross-sectional study in which data were collected using the World Health Organization (WHO) stepwise approach to surveillance (STEPS) questionnaire and calculated using WHO analysis programmes <b>guide.</b> Weight and <b>height</b> were measured using standard WHO procedures, and body mass index was calculated as weight (kg) /height (m 2). Data on ART duration were extracted from patients’ files. CD 4 lymphocyte counts and viral load were determined using standard laboratory techniques. Results: Of the 214 participants, 8. 9 %, 54. 7 % and 36. 4 % were underweight, normal weight and overweight, respectively. Physical activity (OR: 0. 99,  p = 0. 001) and male gender (OR: 0. 29,  p = 0. 04) were negatively associated with overweight. Men who used tobacco {{were more likely to be}} underweight than non-tobacco users (OR: 10. 87,  p = 0. 02). Neither ART duration nor viral load or CD 4 count was independently associated with underweight or overweight in multivariate analysis. Conclusion: A high proportion of people on ART were overweight and a smaller proportion underweight. There is a need to simultaneously address the two extreme weight problems in this vulnerable population through educating them on benefits of avoiding tobacco, engaging in physical activity and raising awareness of CVD risk...|$|R
