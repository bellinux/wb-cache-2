A simple trend with age was apparent in only two instances; these occurred only in the second experi-ment.

40|$|TH E {{need for}} a rapid assay capable of {{measuring}} biologically available en-ergy is well recognized by those concerned with the purchase of feed ingredients, the <b>formulation</b> <b>of</b> poultry <b>diets</b> and the qual-ity control of mixed feeds. Conventional biological assay techniques for metaboliz-able energy (M. E.) require more time than is normally available when the data are {{to be used in}} the above practices. Tables of biologically derived M. E. data, while capable of serving as useful guides to ingredient purchasers and diet formula-tors, are not entirely satisfactory since M. E. values for samples of an ingredient may be extremely variable. For example, Sibbald and Slinger (1962) reported that M. E. values for 25 samples of whea...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} effects of heat {{treatments}} on chemical composition of Groundbean (GB). Groundbean seeds were cleaned, soaked, dehulled and cooked for varying periods. The samples were separately dried and milled into fine flours. The flour samples were analyzed for proximate, minerals and antinutrients composition using standard methods. Results showed that proximate composition of all samples varied. The Untreated Groundbean (UTGB) had the highest proximate composition which was significantly different from all nutrients tested (p< 0. 05) except for fibre (3. 65 %) in Undehulled Cooked Groundbean (UDCGB) and Carbohydrate (CHO) content (63. 63 %) in Soaked Dehulled Cooked Groundbean (SODCGB). SOGB had the highest iron (Fe) (6. 80 mg), calcium (Ca) (52. 53 mg), sodium (Na) (1. 48 mg), manganese (Mn) (20. 78 mg) and zinc (Zn) (2. 34 mg) content which were significantly different from others (p< 0. 05). UTGB had the highest Copper (Cu) (3. 89 mg), magnesium (Mg) (1. 46 mg), Phosphorus (Ph) (345. 45 mg), Potassiun (K) (263. 80 mg) and Iodine (I 2) (102. 18 mcg/g) which was significantly different from others (p< 0. 05). The antinutrient composition of all samples was low except for Trypsin Inhibitor (TI) where UTGB had the highest TI (29. 45 mg) which was {{significantly different from the}} rest.

40|$|Present PhD thesis was {{realised}} at the Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production (University of Napoli, Federico II, Italia) {{in order}} to study the functional properties of dietary fiber fractions (soluble and insoluble) in nutrition of different mono-stomached species. With this aim more than 30 different feedstuffs were evaluated using several analytic techniques (Weende, Van Soest and Prosky) (Chapter 2). Thereafter seems interesting to underline that main of the tested substrates are by-products and could represent economical and readily available nutrient sources. Moreover, in order define the functional activities and the potential health benefits some of these feedstuffs were tested also in vitro using the cumulative gas production technique (IVGPT). Tree different trials (Chapters 3 - 4 - 5) of IVGPT were carried out using as inoculum faeces from adult dog, swine and cat, respectively. The comparison of chemical data and fermentation parameters was important to better define the potential functionality of each tested substrate {{in order to}} identify new functional ingredients. The obtained results offer a good perspectives for the possibility of using several less known materials (e. g. chestnuts, citrus by-products, legume and fruit fibers) in the <b>formulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>diets.</b> The study evidenced also the specific carbohydrates composition of ingredients, such as seeds of pshyllium, line and hemp, usually utilized only for their fatty acids profile. Each tested feedstuff presented specific characteristics, which allow it to be useful in specific stage of life of omnivores and carnivores species, including human...|$|R
