5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make <b>it</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make <b>it</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E
5|$|Respiration {{involves}} drawing {{water into}} the mantle cavity through an aperture, passing <b>it</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> gills, and expelling <b>it</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> siphon. The ingress of water is achieved by contraction of radial muscles in the mantle wall, and flapper valves shut when strong circular muscles force the water out through the siphon. Extensive connective tissue lattices support the respiratory muscles {{and allow them to}} expand the respiratory chamber. The lamella structure of the gills allows for a high oxygen uptake; up to 65% in water at 20⁰C. Water flow over the gills correlates with locomotion, and an octopus can propel its body when it expels water out of its siphon.|$|E
5|$|US-412 was {{extended}} into Oklahoma in 1988 to encourage recreational travel {{and the resulting}} economic benefit to the state. This extension, in which the new designation replaced or overlapped several already existing highways, brought US-412's western terminus to Woodward. In 1993, it {{was extended}} west of Oklahoma, bringing <b>it</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Panhandle and into New Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Bitter, {{confused}} fighting continued {{behind the}} 35th Infantry's {{line for the}} next week. Battalions, companies, and platoons, cut off and isolated, fought independently of higher control and help except for airdrops which supplied many of them. Airdrops also supplied relief forces {{trying to reach the}} front-line units. Tanks and armored cars drove to the isolated units with supplies of food and ammunition and carried back critically wounded on the return trips. In general, the 35th Infantry fought in its original battle line positions, while at first one battalion, and later two battalions, of the 27th Infantry fought toward <b>it</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> estimated 3,000 North Koreans operating in its rear areas.|$|E
5|$|Candidate state {{reptiles}} are not {{assured of}} making <b>it</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> legislative process. In Minnesota, 1998 and 1999 bills proposing the Blanding's turtle were unsuccessful. In Pennsylvania in 2009, the House passed an eastern box turtle bill which {{died in the}} Senate without a vote. Virginia proponents of the eastern box turtle have seen 1999 and 2009 bids fail. For the most recent attempt, a legislative opponent of the turtle {{said it was too}} cowardly for the state because of its defensive shell, and suggested the rattlesnake would be a better representative. The turtle also drew scorn for often perishing on roads, but its most serious problem was a too-close association with bordering state, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is too {{reactive}} {{to occur}} as the free element in nature but is very {{abundant in the}} form of its chloride salts. It is the twentieth most abundant element in Earth's crust and makes up 126parts per million of <b>it,</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> large deposits of chloride minerals, especially sodium chloride, that have been evaporated from water bodies. All of these pale in comparison to the reserves of chloride ions in seawater: smaller amounts at higher concentrations occur in some inland seas and underground brine wells, such as the Great Salt Lake in Utah and the Dead Sea in Israel.|$|E

5|$|Clydesdale (or Strathclyde) was {{the heartland}} of the old Kingdom of Strathclyde; by Donnchadh's day the Scots had settled many English and Continental Europeans (principally Flemings) in the region, and {{administered}} <b>it</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> sheriffdom of Lanark. Gaelic too had penetrated much of the old Northumbrian and Strathclyde territory, coming from the west, south-west and the north, a situation that led historian Alex Woolf to compare the region to the Balkans. The British language of the area, {{as a result of}} such developments, was probably either dead or almost dead, perhaps surviving only in the uplands of Clydesdale, Tweeddale and Annandale.|$|E
5|$|Harrison Scott, {{a retired}} engineer, was {{traveling}} north on I-5 {{with his son}} in 1991, when his son speculated about the difficulty of driving over the first road through the rugged terrain. Having some extra time, and recalling a drive on the old road in 1955, they left the freeway and traveled along most of the abandoned section. Near SR138, Scott asked a county road crew which was resurfacing the road if it was still maintained by the county, and the crew replied that they didn't know who maintained <b>it</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> desert. It {{turned out that the}} county officially owned it but did not maintain it; Scott has since convinced the county and forest to exchange ownership with the Santa Anita Canyon Road, then a county road.|$|E
5|$|Hughes, in {{his speech}} at the opening session of the conference on November 12, 1921, made the American proposal—the U.S would {{decommission}} or not build 30 warships if Great Britain did the same for 19 vessels, and Japan 17 ships. The secretary was generally successful, and agreements were reached on this and other points, including settlements to disputes over islands in the Pacific, and limitations {{on the use of}} poison gas. The naval agreement was limited to battleships and to some extent aircraft carriers, and in the end did not prevent rearmament. Nevertheless, Harding and Hughes were widely applauded in the press for their work. Harding had appointed Senator Lodge and the Senate Minority Leader, Alabama's Oscar Underwood, to the U.S. delegation; they helped ensure that the treaties made <b>it</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Senate mostly unscathed, though that body added reservations to some of the treaties.|$|E

5|$|In April 1945, Robertson {{returned}} to the field, replacing Alan Ramsay as commander of the 5th Division, which was then engaged {{in the final stages}} of the New Britain Campaign. In July, Robertson became commander of the 6th Division, leading <b>it</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> final days of the Aitape–Wewak Campaign. On 13 September 1945, Robertson accepted the surrender of Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi, and his Japanese Eighteenth Army. In December 1945, Robertson took over command of the First Army, becoming one of a select number of Australians to command such a formation, at least on paper, with the rank of lieutenant general. For the final campaigns, Robertson was mentioned in despatches a fourth time.|$|E
5|$|In August 2002, Angel spent 24 hours {{shackled}} underwater {{in a phone}} booth-sized {{water torture}} cell near the WWE entertainment store in New York's Times Square, WWE corporation being {{the owners of the}} World Underground Theatre where Angel had been performing his stage show. To prepare for the trick, he practiced in a neighbor's backyard swimming pool next to his mother's house in East Meadow, New York. Prior to the performance he had only managed to spend 12 consecutive hours in the water. He fasted for 24 hours before the performance to make <b>it</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> period without need to exit and use the washroom. During the trick he went through 16 oxygen tanks. After the trick he was required to remove his own shackles and chains before exiting the water. Within an hour, his skin began to react substantially to the water.|$|E
5|$|In Marion, {{the body}} of Warren Harding was placed on a horse-drawn hearse, which was {{followed}} by President Coolidge and Chief Justice Taft, then by Harding's wife and father. They followed <b>it</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> city, past the Star building where the presses stood silent, and at last to the Marion Cemetery, where the casket {{was placed in the}} cemetery's receiving vault. Harding's body, along with that of his wife who died in 1924, rests today in the Harding Tomb, which was dedicated in 1931 by President Hoover.|$|E

5|$|In fact, Puccini was {{at first}} less than {{enthusiastic}} about the idea for this comic opera– Florence as a setting did not appeal to him, and he feared the public would have {{little interest in the}} subject. However, he soon became interested, and did some work on the piece even while composing Suor Angelica. The religious-themed opera was completed in September 1917, and Puccini turned his full attention to Gianni Schicchi, although the war news and the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which Puccini lost a sister, distracted him from his work. The first draft was completed on 20 April 1918, and Puccini continued to refine and orchestrate <b>it</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1918.|$|E
5|$|Jains cite inequalities, sufferings, {{and pain}} as {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} karma. Various types of karma are classified according to their effects on the potency of the soul. The Jain theory seeks to explain the karmic process by specifying the various causes of karmic influx (āsrava) and bondage (bandha), placing equal emphasis on deeds themselves, and the intentions behind those deeds. The Jain karmic theory attaches great responsibility to individual actions, and eliminates any reliance on some supposed existence of divine grace or retribution. The Jain doctrine also holds that it is possible for us to both modify our karma, and to obtain release from <b>it,</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> austerities and purity of conduct.|$|E

5|$|Nuclear import {{depends on}} the importin binding its cargo in the {{cytoplasm}} and carrying <b>it</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, a {{tropical}} storm was located about 200mi (330km) east of Guadeloupe. With a steady west-northwest path, the storm moved across the northern Lesser Antilles on September 23, during which it intensified into a hurricane. It passed a short distance north of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic as it reached its peak intensity of 90mph (150km). Late on September 26 the hurricane turned northwestward, bringing <b>it</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Turks and Caicos Islands and eastern Bahamas. Recurving north-northeastward, the cyclone moved into open waters, and was last classified as {{a tropical}} cyclone on September 30 about 390mi (630km) east of Cape Hatteras. However, one hurricane researcher assessed the hurricane as lasting until October 3, with the cyclone turning eastward and dissipating near the Azores.|$|E
