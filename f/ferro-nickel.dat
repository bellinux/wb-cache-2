5000|$|Former open-pit mining {{operations}} based on laterite were undertaken at Çikatova (Dushkaja and Suke) and Gllavica. Remaining mineable reserves have been calculated as 13.2 Mt averaging 1.42% Ni and 0.05% Co. Production stopped in 1999 and has resumed [...] The buyer of Ferronikeli, IMR/Alferon, paid 33 million euro ($38.76 million) for the plant. The company had to invest at least 20 million euro {{in the first}} three years and to employ 1,000 {{at the end of the}} first year.Ferronikeli ore mining and metallurgical complex was set up in 1984 to produce <b>ferro-nickel</b> for exports. It produced and exported 6,800 tonnes a year of nickel, in <b>ferro-nickel</b> ingots, before the 1990s but since 1998 it has been idle.Ferronikeli has three open pit mines: the Dushkaja mine with estimated reserves of 6.2 million tones; the Suka mine - 0.8 million tonnes and the Gllavica with 6.8 million tones.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{developments in}} <b>ferro-nickel</b> furnace technology, specifically improvements to cooling methods, furnace controls, and high voltage furnace operating regime. The evolution of these technologies is briefly presented, as context for describing {{the current state}} of the art that has enabled <b>ferro-nickel</b> furnace operation at over 75 MW and specific energy consumption of less than 400 kWh/t dry ore. Examples from existing operations are used to illustrate present best practices, and potential future trends are discussed. The paper begins with an overview of the fundamental aspects of pyrometallurgical treatment of lateritic ores that drive <b>ferro-nickel</b> furnace design. Furnace wall cooling methods are related to the requirements resulting from specific furnace process conditions, including slag and metal compositions, as well as arc and bath power. The benefits of high productivity and low specific energy consumption resulting from high voltage (shielded-arc) operating practice are discussed, along with the furnace controls and electrical power train that enable such operation even with captive power generation. 1...|$|E

40|$|Most nickel is {{produced}} as <b>Ferro-Nickel</b> through a smelting process from Ni-bearing ore. However, these days, {{there have been}} some problems in nickel production due to exhaustion and the low-grade of Ni-bearing ore. Moreover, the smelting process results in a large amount of wastewater, slag and environmental risk. Therefore, in this research, spent Ni-Cd batteries were used as a base material instead of Ni-bearing ore for the recovery of Fe-Ni alloy through a direct reduction process. Spent Ni-Cd batteries contain 24 wt% Ni, 18. 5 wt% Cd, 12. 1 % C and 27. 5 wt% polymers such as KOH. For pre-treatment, Cd was vaporized at 1024 K. In order to evaluate the reduction conditions of nickel oxide and iron oxide, pre-treated spent Ni-Cd batteries were experimented on under various temperatures, gas-atmospheres and crucible materials. By a series of process, alloys containing 75 wt% Ni and 20 wt% Fe were produced. From the results, the reduction mechanism of nickel oxide and iron oxide were investigated...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{differences}} of characteristics between the new ferronickel slag generated from the production of nickel and the slag which had {{been used as a}} material reclama-tion. The Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test was conducted on ferronickel slag to determine the concentration of heavy metals leaching. Then, the tests of X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) are also conducted on the ferronickel slag samples. The results of TCLP test show that the new <b>ferro-nickel</b> slag samples contain Fe (158, 6775 ppm), Cr (0. 64465 ppm), and Pb (0. 0219 ppm), and that the ferronickel slag {{has been used as a}} reclamation material containing Fe (3. 94 ppm) and Cr (2. 91 ppm). The result of EDX test shows that the slag sample from the reclamation area contains higher Ni concentration than the new slag sample.

40|$|An {{innovative}} technology for processing saprolitic laterite ores from the Philippines by hydrochloric acid atmospheric leaching and spray hydrolysis is proposed. The {{factors that affect}} the hydrochloric acid atmospheric leaching of the laterite ores and spray hydrolysis of the atmospheric acid leach solution are investigated. Experimental {{results show that the}} leaching of Ni, Fe, and Mg is 98. 9 wt%, 97. 8 wt%, and 80. 9 wt%, respectively, under optimal acid leaching conditions. The hydrolysis of Ni and Fe by the atmospheric acid leach solution approaches 100 wt% at the temperature range of 450 - 500 degrees C. Characterization results show that a serpentine mineral, nominally Mg 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) (4), is the major component and goethite, FeO(OH), is the minor one in the laterite ores. Treatment by hydrochloric acid atmospheric leaching breaks the mineral lattices of the laterite ores and makes amorphous silica the primary product in the atmospheric acid leach residue. The grade of Ni in the hydrolyzate increases to 4. 55 %. The hydrolyzate with high Ni content can be utilized for <b>ferro-nickel</b> production. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{object of}} the {{investigation}} is oxidized and compound copper ores of the Udokan deposit and oxidized nickel ores (ONOs) of the Urals. New data on the mechanism of {{the action of the}} collector with oxidized copper minerals have been obtained. An original process of dressing the Udokan ores has been devised, with this reagent used. A process of reduction-sulphidizing roasting of copper concentrates without releasing sulphur into a gas phase has been developed. New data on the process of segregation dressing of the ONOs and equilibrium in the ferronickel - slag phase system have been obtained. The values of the constants of the equilibrium between Si and Ni in the Ni-Fe-Si-Co-O system have been defined. The results of the work have been used by the MINPROK Co.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is to present the results of a first {{systematic}} study of spatial distribution of different chemical elements in surface soil over of the Kavadarci region known for its <b>ferro-nickel</b> industrial activity in the nearest past. There were several investigation of soil, vegetables and fruits produced in this region known but they were mainly concerned with contamination by nickel, iron, cobalt and chromium. Other elements were not determined though it is known that the minerals of many other heavy metals (As, Cd, Cu, Sb, Se, etc.) are present in iron-nickel ores used for the production of nickel in the smelter plants. The study on the atmospheric deposition of trace metals over the entire territory of the Republic of Macedonia identified the most polluted areas and characterize different pollution sources. However, it was found that the most important sources of trace metal deposition are ferrous and non-ferrous smelters including the area of Kavadarci and its surroundings. For this reason, the goal of this work was to determine the content of 36 major and trace elements in the soil from the the town og Kavadarci and its surroundings and to assess the size of the ferronickel smelter plant situated near the town...|$|E
