25|$|Games 4 and 5 {{were the}} most {{controversial}} of the series. The Spurs, after being comfortably in control of game 4, saw their 11-point fourth quarter lead dwindle away, to a 2-point Suns lead. With 18 seconds left, Robert Horry bodychecked Steve Nash in which he threw his arms in the air, into the scorers table. Nash's teammates <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> defense; during the ensuing altercation, Stoudemire and Boris Diaw left the bench heading toward the altercation. Their action violated NBA rules, resulting in the decision by league commissioner David Stern to suspend both players for game 5 (Horry was also suspended two games for his flagrant foul against Nash). In game 5, played in Phoenix, the short-handed Suns jumped out early and enjoyed a 16-point lead on the Spurs, but in a reversal of game 4, this time the Spurs came back {{in the final seconds}} and won the game 88–85, giving San Antonio a 3–2 series lead.|$|E

500|$|Ferdinand Rockwell {{replaced}} Uteritz at quarterback. [...] When Rockwell {{came into}} the game, Michigan lined up for a field goal with Rockwell holding the ball. [...] As the Marines came through to block the kick, Rockwell <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet and ran the ball 26 yards for a touchdown. [...] The touchdown run was Rockwell's first play for Michigan's varsity team. [...] In addition to the touchdowns by Uteritz and Rockwell, Michigan also scored on touchdowns by Jim Miller and Frederick Parker.

[...] The other three quarters were played for regulation periods of 15 minutes.|$|E
500|$|These insults {{culminated in}} an altercation {{between the two}} on March 16, 2003, at Pride 25. Following a victory over Kevin Randleman, Jackson was given the {{microphone}} and started talking directly to Silva, who was sitting at ringside, saying [...] "I want you boy. It's gonna be me and you." [...] Silva immediately <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet {{and made his way}} into the ring. He was now face-to-face with Jackson, who continued by saying, [...] "You have my belt, you're keeping it warm for me." [...] Silva responded by yelling [...] "MY BELT!" [...] and giving Jackson a forceful shove. Jackson, visibly upset, advanced towards Silva as dozens of Pride officials intervened. Jackson stood still as he was surrounded by officials, while Silva had to be constantly restrained from charging at Jackson. Jackson later stated that he was instructed by Pride executives to make these comments. He added that Silva's shove infuriated him, and he was ready to fight Silva immediately.|$|E
500|$|Mohammed M'Barek {{expressed}} {{frustration with}} the French authorities that had kept him [...] "in prison for two-and-a-half years for nothing".

He {{even went so far as}} to appeal to the new French president Nicolas Sarkozy for justice. On the third day of the trial, the courtroom descended into chaos as Monsieur M'Barek burst into tears then <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet pointing at Shaftesbury's family. He attempted to blame the Ashley-Cooper family for the peer's death, claiming that they were the guilty ones. [...] "You're the guilty ones, you the rich, who want to take his inheritance!" [...] he shouted as police wrestled with him in the dock. After refusing requests from his lawyer and the judge to sit down and be quiet, M'Barek was taken down to the cells and the hearing temporarily adjourned.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} written in 1955, by Mae Boren Axton, {{a high school teacher}} with a {{background}} in musical promotion, and Jacksonville based singer–songwriter Tommy Durden. The lyrics were based on a report supposedly in The Miami Herald about a man who had destroyed all his identity papers and <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> death from a hotel window, leaving a suicide note with the single line, [...] "I walk a lonely street". In 2016, an article in Rolling Stone magazine suggested that the story in reality originated from a report about a painter and petty criminal, Alvin Krolik, whose marriage had failed and who wrote a partial autobiography including the line [...] "This {{is the story of a}} person who walked a lonely street." [...] Krolik's story was published in news media, and received further publicity after he was shot and killed in an attempted robbery in El Paso, Texas. [...] On August 25, 1955, the El Paso Times reported Krolik's death under the headline [...] "Story Of Person Who Walked Lonely Street".|$|E

Henry was visibly shaken by the {{experience}} of witnessing the two Fidais' total disregard for their own lives. He accepted Sinan's terms of peace on a non-tribute paying basis. The Nizaris thus averted debilitating wars against them because of their Fidais' feats of self-sacrifice and assassinations of powerful enemy leaders to demonstrate the will and commitment of the community to live free from being a vassal to any Levantine power.|$|E

2500|$|The first suicide {{from the}} {{building}} occurred on April 7, 1931, before the tower was even completed, when a carpenter who had been laid-off went to the 58th floor and jumped. The first suicide after the building's opening occurred from the 86th floor observatory on February 1935, when 22-year-old Irma P. Eberhardt fell [...] onto a marquee sign. On December 16, 1943, William Lloyd Rambo, a 22-year-old ex-United States Navy gunner's mate, <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> death from the 86th floor, landing amidst Christmas shoppers on the street below.

2500|$|Mussolini, upon invading Ethiopia, had {{promptly}} {{declared his}} own [...] "Italian Empire." [...] Because the League of Nations afforded Haile Selassie {{the opportunity to}} address the assembly, Italy even withdrew its League delegation, on 12 May 1936. It was {{in this context that}} Haile Selassie walked into the hall of the League of Nations, introduced by the President of the Assembly as [...] "His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Ethiopia" [...] (Sa Majesté Imperiale, l'Empereur d'Ethiopie). The introduction caused a great many Italian journalists in the galleries to erupt into jeering, heckling, and whistling. As it turned out, they had earlier been issued whistles by Mussolini's son-in-law, Count Galeazzo Ciano. The Romanian delegate, Nicolae Titulescu, famously <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet in response and cried [...] "Show the savages the door!", and they were cleared out. Haile Selassie waited calmly for the hall to be cleared, and responded [...] "majestically" [...] with a speech sometimes considered among the most stirring of the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|Michigan won the 1916 game by a {{score of}} 9–0. [...] According to one account of the game, Michigan quarterback Cliff Sparks [...] "crumpled the Aggie line almost every time he crashed into it and circled ends with ease, and was eel-like in running back punts." [...] The play that drew the most {{attention}} was Sparks' drop-kick on a broken play that gave Michigan a 3-0 lead in the first quarter. [...] The play called for Sparks to take the snap from center and hold the ball for a field goal attempt. [...] The snap from center was high, forcing Sparks to react quickly. [...] One press account described Sparks' actions as follows:"And then seemingly with a single movement, Sparks <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet, grabbed the ball as {{it was about to}} clear his head, whirled to face the goal posts and drop-kicked the ball over the Aggie bar for a count of three points, which then and there cinched the game for the Wolverines. 'It was the greatest individual play ever seen in my whole career as coach or player,' was 'Hurry Up' Yost's comment after the game.
