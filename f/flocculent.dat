5|$|Spiral galaxies {{consist of}} a {{rotating}} disk of stars and interstellar medium, along with a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending outward from the bulge are relatively bright arms. In the Hubble classification scheme, spiral galaxies are listed as type S, followed by a letter (a, b, or c) that indicates the degree of tightness of the spiral arms {{and the size of}} the central bulge. An Sa galaxy has tightly wound, poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region. At the other extreme, an Sc galaxy has open, well-defined arms and a small core region. A galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a <b>flocculent</b> spiral galaxy; in contrast to the grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent and well-defined spiral arms. The speed in which a galaxy rotates is thought to correlate with the flatness of the disc as some spiral galaxies have thick bulges, while others are thin and dense.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{field data}} {{has shown the}} {{effectiveness}} of automatic self-cleaning filters in removing suspended solids down to less than 3 microns in size without <b>flocculents,</b> pre-coats or granulated media. Pre-treatment of ozone systems is often needed to remove organic solids that would utilize high amounts of ozone during oxidation leaving little for complete disinfection. Self-cleaning screen filters can physically remove much of that organic matter efficiently and economically resulting in the need for lower ozone concentrations. The use of ultraviolet light water treatment has been growing rapidly. An effective job of disinfection requires that microorganisms be directly exposed to light of the appropriate wavelength. If suspended particles of sufficient size are present, shadowing can protect microorganisms from inactivating doses of ultraviolet light. Self-cleaning filters remove the likelihood of shadowing. Tests conducted over many days have demonstrated the removal of particles 10 -micron and larger from raw lake-water prior to UV treatment. The ratio of water needed in cleaning the screen to process water varied between 0. 31 % and 0. 40 %. Membrane systems of differing types (micro, ultra, nano, RO) require different degrees of pre-filtration.

Two studies were conducted that measured F- bioavailability and uptake by rice (Oryza sativa L.). In the first study, rice was grown in solution culture (pH 5. 0) with 0, 2, or 4 mM F- as KF to compare the interaction of F- with humic acid (HA) and with a conventional chelating agent, N-hydroxyethylenthylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA). In the second study, F was supplied at 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 mM KF with an additional 2 mM F- treatment containing solution Ca at 2 x (2 mM Ca) the level used in the first study, to test the effect added Ca had on F- availability and uptake. Total biomass was greatest with HEDTA and F- < 1 mM. Leaf and stem F concentrations increased exponentially as solution F- increased linearly, with nearly no F partitioning into the seed. Results suggest that F was taken up as HF 0 while F- uptake was likely restricted. Additionally, F- competed with HA for Ca, thus preventing the formation of Ca-HA <b>flocculents.</b> The addition of soluble Ca resulted in the precipitation of CaF 2 solids on the root surface, as determined by tissue analysis and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy...|$|R

50|$|The {{conventional}} treatment method for water purification is a complex, multistage process {{that was used}} for many years. It generally consists of five primary steps. First, raw water is adjusted for alkalinity and pH {{with the addition of}} hydrated lime and carbon dioxide. Second, particulate matter is congregated with aluminum sulphate and other coagulants, such as polymers, which the water flows in a cascade that mixes the chemicals and raw water with the coagulants. Third, the water is slowly mixed in clarifiers where larger particles settle down to the bottom and are periodically removed (sedimentation). Fourth, water is directed from the clarifiers to the filters (e.g. anthracite and sand filter) to entrap any smaller particles that survived the clarification process. Finally, sodium hydroxide is added to adjust the final pH/alkalinity, sodium hypochlorite for disinfection and fluoride for fluoridation. This process is often used as a pre-treatment method while another processes, such as reverse osmosis, is used for the final treatment.A disadvantage of this method is its use of chemicals, such as ozone, <b>flocculents,</b> hydrogen peroxide, lime, and chlorine for the filtration process. These chemicals could be dangerous if used incorrectly or if they remained in the water after complete treatment. These chemicals could be dangerous if used incorrectly, or if they remain in the water after complete treatment. This requires special precautions, and each step of the process has to be controlled to achieve an overall optimal performance.

40|$|In the hot-dip {{galvanizing}} of steel, process solution arise {{out of the}} preparation of the surface which given {{the current state of the}} art cannot be de-centrally processed. Waste disposal is performed by outside parties, which means that reusable materials which the galvanizing plants could make use of are lost. Membrane procedures have been selected to create integral material cycles, although in the first phase of the project the suitability had to be checked by means of test with technical facilities in the galvanizing of Genthin. It became clear that processing of the acids grease-removal solutions is not possible by means of cross-flow current filtration. The phosphoric acid present in the acidic mixture combines with the free iron ions to stop up the ceramic membranes. The covering of iron phosphate cannot be removed by impulse regeneration. To improve the regeneration capability of the stripper it is planned to modify the grease-removal solution in such a manner that the phosphoric acid does not need to be used. A regeneration of the hydrochloric acid mordant, which has a varying zinc and iron contents, is technically possible with the aid of membrane electrolysis. As a result of the danger of an increase in the level of contaminants as well as economic investment and operating costs, only the zinc should be channeled out. The low-zinc iron mordant can be used in the manufacturing of <b>flocculents</b> in water chemistry. The electrodialysis membrane process has proven to be suitable for channeling water cycles of rising baths. Constant low levels of saline content can be achieved in the baths, which indirectly brings about a reduction of zinc loss in the galvanizing kettle. The separated material can be put in mordant baths as a concentrate. The production-integrated environmental protection achieved thus far can be quantified for a medium-scale works as having a re-circulation of approximately 100 m" 3 /year for hydrochloric acid and 12. 200 kg/year for zinc.

40|$|In recent years, {{anaerobic}} {{membrane bioreactor}} (AnMBR) {{technology has been}} increasingly researched for municipal wastewater treatment {{as a means to}} produce nutrient-rich, solids free effluents with low levels of pathogens, while occupying a small footprint. An AnMBR can be used not only for on-site wastewater treatment, but also for the generation of nutrient-rich irrigation water leading to reuse and recycling possibility for agricultural applications as well. Furthermore, biogas produced in the anaerobic process could potentially be used for minimising the energy requirements of AnMBR operation. Despite the mentioned advantages, the current state-of-the-art AnMBR technology for potential full-scale application raises some concerns related to energy requirements and investment costs for membrane fouling control, as well as the impact of high shear stress on biomass activity. Municipal wastewater in many countries can be characterised as low strength and is generated at high flows rates, related to the population served. However, ongoing efforts in water conservation and the implementation of source separated sewer systems may possibly change municipal wastewater characteristics in the near future. Several factors involved in design and operation of AnMBR systems may influence membrane fouling, such as treatment plant configuration and membrane characteristics, feeding and biomass properties and operational conditions. Among them, reactor design is proposed as an important factor that can change the AnMBR sludge fouling propensity. To date, especially in the last decade, many studies have been conducted in which various types of anaerobic reactors, including completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR), upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor, expanded granular sludge bed reactor (EGSB), were used in combination with various types of membranes. Among them, a membrane coupled UASB reactor may be a promising approach to overcome problems related with fouling since the membrane is only subjected to supernatant filtration and not by bulk sludge. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the applicability of an innovative AnMBR configuration in order to produce a pathogen-free but nutrient-rich effluent for use in agricultural irrigation, concomitantly enabling energy recovery. With the realization of this study, flux enhancement by controlling the total solids (TS) load to the membrane was the major starting point, bringing AnMBR technology for full-scale sewage treatment one step closer to realisation. The AnMBR-Digester system as developed in this study may offer a solution for the mentioned challenges. The system consisted of a membrane integrated UASB reactor coupled to a parallel operating digester that can be operated at any required process temperature between 0 - 40 °C. The external cross-flow tubular membrane module contained 28 membrane fibers with a very small internal tube diameter of 1. 5 mm in order to increase the filtration area for accommodating large sewage flows. Blocking of the membrane module lumens is minimised by the preceding UASB reactor, which scavenges the large part of suspended solids (SS), having only the supernatant subjected to membrane filtration. Besides that, the combination of a UASB reactor and a sludge digester, the so-called UASB-Digester system, {{has been shown to be}} successful for mutual sewage treatment at low temperature and sludge stabilization. Therefore, membrane integration to the UASB-Digester system can be attractive for producing high quality and nutrient-rich effluents for reuse purposes under moderate climate conditions. Based on this general aim, the optimum upflow velocity that will result in an effluent with good filterability is determined in a laboratory-scale UASB reactor for the case of membrane coupled UASB reactor systems. Filterability tests were carried out in order to assess the effect of upflow velocity on subsequent membrane performance. Results indicated a significant impact of upflow velocity on both biological performance and physicochemical effluent characteristics. Operation at a higher upflow velocity caused the washout of colloidal particles. Effluent characterization results coincided with filterability tests. Results showed that filterability of the effluent during the operation at 0. 6 m/h was better than that during the operation at 1. 2 m/h. The observed differences in protein/carbohydrate ratio (P/C) and particle size distribution (PSD), which play important roles in membrane fouling, lead to the hypothesis that upflow velocity is a critical parameter for effluent filterability in membrane coupled UASB reactors. In subsequent experiments, the membrane was integrated into the UASB reactor and the system was operated as an AnMBR system with an upflow velocity of 0. 6 m/h in order to understand the impact of membrane addition on both the biological performance and sludge characteristics. Membrane incorporation induced an accumulation of fine particles and a decrease in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), resulting in a decrease in PSD and thus, a drop in sludge settleability. Deterioration of sludge settleability led to an increase in sludge washout, with a resultant increase in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations in the UASB effluent. However, SS-free permeate with an average COD of 42 mg/L was obtained and despite the sludge bed deterioration, the average transmembrane pressure (TMP) value was 85 mbar during reactor operation, indicating that no severe membrane fouling occurred in the AnMBR. Following that investigation, the AnMBR was operated at 15 °C in order to investigate whether the membrane coupled UASB is a technically feasible alternative in the treatment of municipal wastewater at lower temperatures. The results showed that membrane fouling at 15 °C was more severe than at 25 °C. Increased COD and soluble microbial products (SMP) concentrations, reduced particle’s diameter, and higher turbidity in the UASB reactor effluent at lower temperature aggravated membrane fouling. However, treatment performance was not considerably affected by temperature possibly due to the retention capacity of membrane. Cake resistance was found responsible for over 40 % of the total fouling at both temperatures. However, an increase was observed in the contribution of irreversible fouling resistance to the total filtration resistance (RT) at lower temperature, related to the larger amount of fine particles in the UASB reactor effluent. During the operation at 15 °C, differences were observed in sludge characteristics at different heights along the UASB reactor. The best location in the sludge bed for conveying the sludge from the UASB reactor to the digester needed to be determined. Analysis over the height of the reactor with time showed that TS, volatile solids (VS), TSS and volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentrations in the reactor decreased with height, and highest COD concentration of 46 g/L was observed at the bottom of the reactor. The active biomass remained near the inlet of the reactor; whereas, non-active biomass consisted of loose, suspended particles and <b>flocculents</b> moved towards the top. This was confirmed by the high specific COD consumption rate near the inlet and the poor specific COD biodegradation in the remaining portions of the bioreactor. Apparently, the assumption of a completely mixed sludge bed behavior for the UASB reactor, being part of an AnMBR system, does not hold for this type of reactor systems even at low temperatures, which makes the location in the sludge bed from where the sludge is to be conveyed to the digester of operational importance. Considering the observed sludge bed stratification with regard to sludge stability and solids concentration, the sludge to be recirculated from the UASB reactor to the digester is recommended to be extracted from the sampling point where the sludge has the lowest stability. A low value of stability coincides with a high amount of anaerobic biodegradable organic compounds present in the sludge. Finally, the impact of digester coupling on removal efficiency and filtration performance of the AnMBR was investigated. Digester incorporation remarkably influenced the characteristics of the UASB reactor effluent, resulting in a decrease in turbidity, soluble and total COD and an increase in median particle size (D 50), which led to a substantial decrease in the RT. Improved stability and specific methanogenic activity (SMA) of the sludge were achieved in the UASB reactor with an increase in total biogas production of the AnMBR-Digester system. The sludge recirculation from the sampling point having the lowest stability in the AnMBR-Digester system improved both the solids physical removal and the conversion, which confirms the importance of sludge transfer point selection, especially for the filtration performance of AnMBR-Digester systems. Overall, it can be concluded that the UASB reactor is a suitable alternative for coupling membranes in AnMBR systems at 25 °C. Despite the sludge bed deterioration, SS-free permeate with an average COD of 42 mg/L was obtained and the average TMP of 85 mbar was maintained during the operation period, indicating no severe membrane fouling. However, this configuration is not found technically feasible at 15 °C, considering the deterioration of the filtration performance, which would be a bottleneck to the practical engineering application of AnMBRs. Thus, the filtration performance of the investigated single stage AnMBR was limited by the low temperature. In that situation, the results revealed the high potential of the new AnMBR-Digester configuration for treating municipal wastewater at 15 °C, as it couples wastewater treatment and sludge stabilization. Under optimized sludge recirculation conditions, the integrated AnMBR-Digester system represents an efficient technology to mitigate rapid membrane fouling for the low temperature applications of membrane coupled UASB reactors.

After 4 hrs. 25 m. [page 46] it nearly equalled the cell in diameter; and a second sphere about half as large as the first, together with a few other minute ones, were formed. After 6 hrs. the fluid in which these spheres floated was almost colourless. After 8 hrs. 35 m. (always reckoning from the time when the solution was first added) four new minute spheres had appeared. Next morning, after 22 hrs., there were, besides the two large spheres, seven smaller ones, floating in absolutely colourless fluid, in which some <b>flocculent</b> greenish matter was suspended.|$|E

But always silently! The woods were so choked with it--the branches were so laden with it--it had so permeated, filled and possessed earth and sky; it had so cushioned and muffled the ringing rocks and echoing hills, that all sound was deadened.

60|$|Calciferous Glands.--These glands (see Fig. 1), {{judging from}} {{their size and}} from their rich supply of blood-vessels, must be of much {{importance}} to the animal. But almost as many theories have been advanced on their use as there have been observers. They consist of three pairs, which in the common earth-worm debouch into the alimentary canal {{in advance of the}} gizzard, but posteriorly to it in Urochaeta and some other genera. {23} The two posterior pairs are formed by lamellae, which, according to Claparede, are diverticula from the oesophagus. {24} These lamellae are coated with a pulpy cellular layer, with the outer cells lying free in infinite numbers. If one of these glands is punctured and squeezed, a quantity of white pulpy matter exudes, consisting of these free cells. They are minute, and vary in diameter from 2 to 6 microns. They contain in their centres a little excessively fine granular matter; but they look so like oil globules that Claparede and others at first treated them with ether. This produces no effect; but they are quickly dissolved with effervescence in acetic acid, and when oxalate of ammonia is added to the solution a white precipitate is thrown down. We may therefore conclude that they contain carbonate of lime. If the cells are immersed in a very little acid, they become more transparent, look like ghosts, and are soon lost to view; but if much acid is added, they disappear instantly. After a very large number have been dissolved, a <b>flocculent</b> residue is left, which apparently consists of the delicate ruptured cell-walls. In the two posterior pairs of glands the carbonate of lime contained in the cells occasionally aggregates into small rhombic crystals or into concretions, which lie between the lamellae; but I have seen only one case, and Claparede only a very few such cases.|$|E

"On the 11th of February, lat. 60° 52' S., long. 80° 20' E., and March 3, lat. 53° 55' S., long. 108° 35' E., the {{sounding}} instrument came up {{filled with a}} very fine cream-coloured paste, which scarcely effervesced with acid, and dried into a very light, impalpable, white powder.

By far the most abundant was the little bundle of silicious rods, fastened together loosely at one end, separating from one another at the other end, and the whole bundle loosely twisted into a spindle. The rods are hollow, and contain the characteristic endochrome of the Diatomaceoe. Like the Globigerina ooze, then, which it succeeds to the southward in a band apparently of no great width, the materials of this silicious deposit are derived entirely from the surface and intermediate depths. It is somewhat singular that Diatoms did not appear to be in such large numbers on the surface over the Diatom ooze as they were a little further north. This may perhaps be accounted for by our not having struck their belt of depth with the tow-net; or it is possible that when we found it on the 11th of February the bottom deposit was really shifted a little to the south by the warm current, the excessively fine <b>flocculent</b> débris of the Diatoms taking a certain time to sink. The belt of Diatom ooze is certainly a little further to the southward in long. 83° E., in the path of the reflux of the Agulhas current, than in long. 108° E.|$|E
