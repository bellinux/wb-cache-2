5|$|The 1970 and 1971 seasons {{provided}} no suitable seeding candidates. Despite this, flights were conducted into Hurricane <b>Ginger.</b> <b>Ginger</b> {{was not a}} suitable storm for seeding, due to its diffuse, indistinct nature. The seeding had no effect. <b>Ginger</b> was the last seeding done by Project Stormfury.|$|E

5|$|For {{about six}} days, <b>Ginger</b> {{maintained}} minimal hurricane status. As it meandered over the central Atlantic Ocean, it maintained {{an unusually large}} eye, reaching 80 mi (130 km) in diameter. On September 18, <b>Ginger</b> turned {{to the south and}} slowly executed a tight counterclockwise loop within three days. By September 21, the hurricane was tracking south of due west, and the next day suddenly intensified to winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). Its westward track briefly posed a threat to Bermuda, although <b>Ginger</b> passed 115 mi (185 km) south of the island on September 23 while slowly weakening. On September 24, <b>Ginger</b> decelerated before beginning a turn to the southwest. By September 26, <b>Ginger</b> briefly weakened to minimal hurricane strength, although re-intensification resumed as the track turned to the west and northwest. Around that time, <b>Ginger</b> absorbed the smaller and weaker Tropical Storm Janice to its southeast.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane <b>Ginger</b> {{formed on}} September6 and lasted until October3, {{for a total}} of 27.25days. Its {{duration}} surpassed that of Hurricane Inga in 1969, which was the previous record-holder, by three days. In 2003, it was discovered that the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane lasted as a tropical cyclone longer than <b>Ginger,</b> although its duration as a tropical cyclone was not continuous. This made <b>Ginger</b> the second longest-lived of any Atlantic hurricane, but it remains the storm that lasted the most consecutive days as a tropical cyclone in the basin.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane <b>Ginger</b> was {{the second}} longest-lasting Atlantic {{hurricane}} on record. The eighth tropical cyclone and fifth hurricane of the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season, <b>Ginger</b> spent 27.25days as a tropical cyclone, lasting from September6 to October3. Twenty of those days (September 11 – September 30), <b>Ginger</b> was classified as a hurricane. The storm formed northeast of the Bahamas, {{and for the first}} nine days of its duration tracked generally eastward or northeastward while gradually strengthening to peak winds of 110mph (175km/h). On September14, <b>Ginger</b> slowed and turned to a general westward track, passing near Bermuda on September23. There, the hurricane produced gusty winds and high waves, but no damage.|$|E

5|$|For three days, {{beginning}} on September 26, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration deployed planes into the hurricane {{as part of}} Project Stormfury, the fourth hurricane {{to be a part}} of the weather control experiment. The plane dropped silver iodide into the center of the hurricane, although there was no effect due to Ginger's large eye and diffuse nature; this was the last seeding done by the project. By September 28, <b>Ginger</b> was moving northwestward toward North Carolina and was steadily intensifying. At around 06:00 UTC the next day, the hurricane reached a secondary peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h), which it maintained for about 18 hours. Afterward, <b>Ginger</b> slowly weakened, and late on September 30 it made landfall near Morehead City, North Carolina, with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). It quickly deteriorated over land, weakening first to a tropical storm and then to a tropical depression by late on October 1. <b>Ginger</b> turned to the north, entered southern Virginia, and later turned to the east. On October 3, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while crossing Hampton Roads into the Atlantic Ocean. The remnants of <b>Ginger</b> continued east-southeastward until being absorbed by a cold front on October 5.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} species {{composition}} of Zingiberaceae and Costaceae in the Trus Madi Range. The <b>gingers</b> were sampled between the elevations of 1, 400 rnq. T. DInd 2, 649 m a. s. 1, {{en route from}} the former base camp of the Forestry Department to Mt. Trus Madi peak and along six 200 -m-long line transects. Twenty-one species of Zingiberaceae and two species of Costaceae were recorded. All species were documented below the elevation of 1, 700 m. The inclusion of these <b>gingers</b> brings the Zingiberaceae-Costaceae herbarium record of the Trus Madi area to 25 species. Three species endemic to the Crocker Range and Mt. Kinabalu were recorded in the study area, namely, Amomum kinabaluense, Amomum sceletescens and Zingiber kelabitianum. Besides being poorly populated by <b>gingers,</b> the study area is highly similar in composition of <b>gingers</b> to three sites in the Crocker Range. If such similarity is consistent for other areas in the Crocker Range, the Trus Madi Range could serve as another conservation area for montane <b>gingers</b> in Sabah...|$|R

5|$|After forming, the {{depression}} moved slowly southeastward for about 24  hours {{before turning to}} the northeast, slowly organizing in the process. On September 10, {{the depression}} turned eastward, and later that day intensified into Tropical Storm <b>Ginger,</b> the seventh named storm {{of the year in}} the Atlantic, about 325 mi (525 km) south of Bermuda. The storm quickly intensified, and within 24 hours reached winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), making it a hurricane. It turned to the northeast, passing well to the east of Bermuda. Late on September 13, <b>Ginger</b> attained its minimum barometric pressure of 959 mbar (28.32 inHg), and early the next day reached peak maximum sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). After reaching a position about halfway between Bermuda and the Azores, the hurricane's eastward movement halted due to a building ridge to its north and east. It turned sharply southward before turning and beginning a westerly drift, during which <b>Ginger</b> weakened to minimal hurricane status.|$|E
