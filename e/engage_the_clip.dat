40|$|A {{technique}} is described for detecting misformed clips in hermetically sealed packages. The technique involves {{use of a}} machine vision system incorporating an image processing algorithm, that calculates the directions of contours of intensity in grey-scale images of <b>clips.</b> <b>The</b> algorithm approximately locates <b>the</b> <b>clip</b> by scanning a box over the contour direction transformed image, and finding {{the position of the}} box such that the standard deviation of the directions in the box is a minimum. <b>The</b> <b>clip</b> is accurately located by scanning a rectangular template over the contour direction transformed image {{in the vicinity of the}} approximate location of <b>the</b> <b>clip,</b> and determining <b>the</b> best-fit position of the template. Accurate location of <b>the</b> <b>clip</b> enables <b>the</b> critical <b>clip</b> dimensions to be calculated and used for assessment of <b>clip</b> integrity. <b>The</b> <b>clip</b> integrity is considered acceptable if all of the critical dimensions lie within an acceptable range, as defined by predetermined upper and lower thresholds...|$|R

40|$|Clipping {{is one of}} the {{simplest}} peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction schemes for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Deliberately <b>clipping</b> <b>the</b> transmission signal degrades system performance, and clipping mitigation is required at the receiver for information restoration. In this work, we acknowledge the sparse nature of <b>the</b> <b>clipping</b> signal and propose a low-complexity Bayesian <b>clipping</b> estimation scheme. <b>The</b> proposed scheme utilizes a priori information about the sparsity rate and noise variance for enhanced recovery. At the same time, the proposed scheme is robust against inaccurate estimates of <b>the</b> <b>clipping</b> signal statistics. <b>The</b> undistorted phase property of <b>the</b> <b>clipped</b> signal, as well as <b>the</b> <b>clipping</b> likelihood, is utilized for enhanced reconstruction. Further, motivated by the nature of modern OFDM-based communication systems, we extend our clipping reconstruction approach to multiple antenna receivers, and multi-user OFDM. We also address the problem of channel estimation from pilots contaminated by <b>the</b> <b>clipping</b> distortion. Numerical findings are presented, that depict favourable results for the proposed scheme compared to the established sparse reconstruction schemes...|$|R
