5|$|Serb sources {{assert that}} the first mujahideen began {{arriving}} <b>in</b> <b>Kosovo</b> {{in the spring of}} 1998, mainly from Bosnia and Herzegovina. By that summer, about 240 mujahideen were present <b>in</b> <b>Kosovo</b> and northern Albania. Most of these were ethnic Albanians, but the group also included several dozen Arabs from the Middle East and North Africa. According to the diary of the ambushed KLA group's leader, Ali Rabiçi, the mujahideen involved in the July 18 ambush had initially gathered in Munich before taking a ferry from Bari to the Albanian port city of Durrës. Once in Albania, the mujahideen were escorted to the frontier towns of Tropojë and Bajram Curri by their KLA handlers, where they rendezvoused with Rabiçi's men.|$|E

5|$|When Kosovo {{was under}} the {{administration}} of the United Nations, the UN flag was flown <b>in</b> <b>Kosovo.</b> However, the flag used by the Kosovar Albanian population was the Albanian flag. The Albanian flag was also used on public buildings, even though it was against UN regulations. Regulations stated only the UN flag and other authorised flags, like those of cities, could fly on public buildings. If the Albanian flag did have to go up, then the Serbian flag must go up too, according to UN regulations. However, this was never done in practice and the flag of Albania was ever-present <b>in</b> <b>Kosovo</b> during the UNMIK period.|$|E
5|$|Aiming {{to reduce}} {{evidence}} of political failure, Yugoslav authorities sought to disperse the refugees {{in various parts}} of Serbia and prevent their concentration in the capital, Belgrade. The government encouraged the refugees to settle in predominantly Hungarian areas of Vojvodina, and <b>in</b> <b>Kosovo,</b> which was largely populated by Albanians, leading to increased instability in those regions. Even though 20,000 were planned to be settled <b>in</b> <b>Kosovo,</b> only 4,000 moved to the region. After 12 August, the Serbian authorities started to deport some of the refugees who were of military age, declaring them illegal immigrants. They were turned over to the VRS or the ARSK in eastern Croatia for conscription. Some of the conscripts were publicly humiliated and beaten for abandoning the RSK. In some areas, ethnic Croats of Vojvodina were evicted from their homes by the refugees themselves to claim new accommodations. Similarly, the refugees moving through Banja Luka forced Croats and Bosniaks out of their homes.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed, Italy {{transformed}} the Albanian Kingdom into Greater Albania, a protectorate of Italy that included most of Kosovo and {{a portion of}} western Macedonia which was detached from Yugoslavia after the Axis powers invaded in 1941. Kosovo Albanians enthusiastically welcomed the Italian occupation. Although officially under Italian rule, the Albanians <b>in</b> <b>Kosovo</b> controlled the region and were encouraged to open Albanian schools, which had been prohibited under Yugoslav rule. They were also given Albanian citizenship by Italian authorities and allowed to fly the Albanian flag. Nevertheless, the Italians kept {{hundreds of thousands of}} troops in Albania and surrounding areas. Yugoslav sources indicated that there were approximately 20,000 Italian soldiers and 5,000 Italian police and frontier guards <b>in</b> <b>Kosovo,</b> and 12,000 soldiers and 5,000 police and border guards in the Albanian-annexed portion of Macedonia. At the same time, Italian military authorities warned that at least ten hostages would be shot for every Italian soldier killed or wounded in these regions.|$|E

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that there were 1,800 Jews in Albania {{at the end of}} the Second World War, eleven times the number of Jews that were living in the country in 1939. The Jewish community <b>in</b> <b>Kosovo</b> never fully recovered from the war. Few Jews remained <b>in</b> <b>Kosovo</b> and many emigrated to Israel during the communist period. Similarly, most Jews in Albania decided to emigrate following the communist takeover. About 300 remained in the country until the early 1990s. The official Albanian census of April 1989 recorded 73 Jews living in the country. With the fall of Communism, Albania eased restrictions on religion and foreign travel, which resulted in virtually the entire Jewish community of the country emigrating to Israel. From December 1990 to June 1991, 350 Albanian Jews were airlifted from Albania to Israel in what was codenamed Operation Flying Carpet. Most of Albania's 60 remaining Jews left in 1997, after the country became engulfed in a brief civil war.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1944, the {{division}} was disbanded. At the same time, Albanians <b>in</b> <b>Kosovo</b> took up arms against the Partisans {{when they learned}} that the region would not be unified with Albania after the war, despite earlier Partisan promises. Atrocities occurred when 30,000 Partisans were sent to Kosovo to quell Albanian resistance in the region. Between 3,000 and 25,000 Kosovo Albanians {{were killed in the}} ensuing violence.|$|E

However, during {{different}} periods of history, different flags were flown <b>in</b> <b>Kosovo.</b> Before 1969, the only flags that could legally fly over Kosovo (then an autonomous province) were those of SFR Yugoslavia and SR Serbia.

The A-10s were deployed to support search and rescue missions, but over time the Warthogs began to receive more ground attack missions. The A-10's first successful attack in Operation Allied Force happened on 6 April 1999; A-10s remained in action until combat ended in late June 1999.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by Nogai, in 1292 Shishman {{launched}} a major campaign against Milutin, his Serbian neighbour to the west. Thanks {{to the support}} of Tatar mercenaries, Shishman's forces raided deeply into Serbian territory and reached Hvosno <b>in</b> <b>Kosovo.</b> After attempting to conquer the fortress of Ždrelo near Peć to no avail and burning the Žiča monastery, Shishman's troops returned to Vidin without any territorial gains. Milutin's response to Shishman's act of aggression was much more successful. His counter-attack resulted in Serbian forces reaching Vidin and capturing Shishman's capital after a brief siege. The despot, however, managed to escape north of the Danube {{to the safety of}} his Tatar suzerains.|$|E
