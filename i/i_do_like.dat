In an {{interview}} with Popjustice {{when asked about the}} song, Burke said, [...] "I've got a passion against liars, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>like</b> myself a bad boy. All young girls my age go for them, we just don't like to admit it, because we always go for them".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said [...] " [...] a nicely worked-out story and strong, integrated gags. He added [...] "it's a particularly well-crafted entry." [...] C. S. Strowbridge of The Numbers said [...] "There {{are a number}} of funny gags on this double-length short, but it feels padded. It's also heavy-handed. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>like</b> that they have a message to go with the jokes, {{but it would have been}} more effective if it were more subtle." [...] Josh Rode of DVD Verdict described the episode as [...] "decent". Shannon Gosney of The Mommy-Files said [...] "there were many parts where my boys just burst out laughing. Even I found myself laughing at times." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. The Daily Mail {{cited as a}} [...] "superb" [...] and [...] "hilarious" [...] episode, and James Plath of DVD Town thought it had strong writing. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "a terrific episode, full of wit and sly digs at our expectations of Homer's abilities. The fact that he invents things that other people find useful (and steal the credit for) is both amusing and a little sad. Poor Homer." [...] Writing for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson commented that [...] "though 'Wizard' borders on 'Homer’s wacky scheme' territory, his attempts {{to come up with}} something significant offer amusement. At no point does 'Wizard' threaten to become a particularly strong episode, but it entertains to a reasonable degree. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>like</b> the 'Everything’s Okay Alarm' and the makeup gun, though." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode also {{continues}} the storyline of Tom and Lynette's separation. Huffman enjoyed her character's storyline, stating: [...] "I'm {{sure there are}} things that they knew the viewers want, which is for Tom and Lynette to get back together. But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>like</b> that it's kind of {{up in the air and}} maybe they won't." [...] Doug Savant commented, [...] "For many years on this show, we knew that Tom and Lynette were the grounding force on the street. They were the couple that most resembled most couples in America. It just got to a point after so many years when [...] really wanted to explore the things that made this relationship work by first pulling it apart." [...] Both actors expressed their desire for the couple to reunite by the series' end. Charles Mesure made his debut as new neighbor Ben Faulkner, a self-made contractor and Renee's new love interest. According to Vanessa Williams, [...] "She’s working hard to make it happen and it’s not happening easily for her. And she’s not used to that and that’s where the comedy ensues and it gives her something to pursue." ...|$|E
500|$|Lopez later {{confirmed}} {{in an interview}} On Air with Ryan Seacrest, that the completed music video would premiere jointly on season ten of American Idol and on Vevo on March 3,2011. Fans could vote between three alternative endings through Idols official website. Lopez said the idea behind giving fans the choice was {{to give them a}} chance to see what she experienced. [...] "You get to do what <b>I</b> <b>do,...</b> <b>Like,</b> I go in there with my videos and I start editing and picking all the shots I like and the things that I like and what I feel the best kind of feeling for the record is. You guys get to do that. We picked two different ones and we weren't sure." [...] The alternative endings included three varying scenes: in the first, the video ends with a close-up of Lopez's face in the silver lace catsuit; the second ends with a shot of dancers defying gravity on the walls and ceiling, while the final ending ends with a shot of Lopez on the dance floor in her harem pants. The first ending was the one used in the final video.|$|E
500|$|The film {{originally}} {{had a different}} ending to the one later released in America under the title Shades of Fear. Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein requested that the ending be reworked prior to distribution, and Winterson was highly unhappy at being asked to write an additional conclusionary scene. Winterson's preferred ending sees Rex Goodyear burn the painting he believes to be fraudulent, only to discover he actually had the genuine item in his possession all along, and has now destroyed it. This ties in with the major theme of the film in Winterson's eyes, whereby [...] "Duncan, Gabriel, Miss Bead and Miss Quim all find something valuable where they least expected it, Rex Goodyear finds that the things we value are very often worthless." [...] Winterson has called Weinstein [...] "a bully who knows the gentle touch", referring to the new ending as [...] "the most expensive words I will ever write". While she believes that the new ending is satisfying, she feels the film has lost some dimensions which were important to her and concludes: [...] "It is a good movie {{but it is not}} the movie I thought we could make. [...] <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>like</b> Great Moments but there is another film in there somewhere that has got lost." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2012 Cockburn stated [...] "I think gay {{marriage}} {{is an incredibly}} boring subject; though, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>like</b> to hear right-wingers say that it will bring the whole edifice of Western civilization crashing down. It's hard, these days, to find such messages of good cheer." [...] Cockburn took an anti-assimilationist position on same-sex marriage asking [...] "Why would an institution which is basically taking church principles, you know, and applying them to a state license to get marriage be regarded as 'progressive'?" [...] He felt it was inconsistent with a radical position, which sees the state as [...] "intrusive on human freedoms", though he did support equality {{at the level of}} civil partnerships he didn't see why this should be limited to monogamous relationships.|$|E
2500|$|The lyrics {{focus on}} the men in Dixon's past {{relationships}} and their lazy attitudes. The chorus states her frustration with men not completing everyday housekeeping tasks; [...] "Does he wash up? Never wash up/Does he clean up? No he never cleans up/Does he brush up? He never brushed up". In the final verse the lyrics state, [...] "And if the man can't dance/He gets no second chance"; a reference to her refusal to date men if they cannot dance. In an interview Dixon explained in further detail about the lyric, saying [...] "I have to be honest, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>like</b> {{a man who can}} dance, but it's not a deal-breaker. It's nice if they can dance, but if they can't we'll just have to work on other areas!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Von Teese has {{appeared}} {{on a number of}} best-dressed lists and frequents the front row of fashion shows, particularly Christian Dior, Vivienne Westwood, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Marc Jacobs, labels she is often seen wearing. Speaking of her love of Gaultier, Von Teese has said, [...] "Jean Paul Gaultier, John Galliano, and Vivienne Westwood were the first designers that really made an impact on me. Jean Paul has {{a lot of the same}} obsessions that <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>like</b> corsetry, ballet-peach satin and silks, black silk velvet, bullet bras and girdles. When I was a teenager, I would look for 1930s peach satin lingerie pieces to try to get his look for less, because there was no way I could afford his things back then. It was a dream come true to meet him and become friends with him. I met him the first time when I was doing my first fashion pictorial, which was for Flaunt magazine, and it was a huge story of me wearing the most important pieces from his haute couture archives, and that was a dream!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Sophia Bush portrays Brooke Davis. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>like</b> about her– {{the things}} that I have had to portray her going through– you always learn a lesson from Brooke", stated Bush. [...] "She always manages to pick herself up when she falls on her face. And I respect that. She is not all high and mighty and she doesn't act like she is always right. She {{has a lot of}} {{convictions}} and she is [...] really loyal friend. I appreciate how loyal she is. She doesn't take betrayal lightly and she doesn't think it is OK to lie to someone." [...] Brooke is the beautiful captain of the high school cheerleading squad, and the best friend of Peyton, and close friend of Haley. She has twice been a girlfriend to Lucas. Though her life appears perfect at the beginning, she is seen to suffer from having to deal with her distant parents, her friends' inability to take her seriously, and the betrayal of Lucas and Peyton when they date behind her back leaving her hurt. She eventually overcomes the betrayal and is determined to live a full, happy life.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Scruggs {{was getting}} bored with {{repetition}} of the classic bluegrass fare. [...] By now, his sons were professional musicians, and he was caught up in their enthusiasm for more contemporary music. He said, [...] "I love bluegrass music, and still like to play it, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>like</b> to mix in some other music for my own personal satisfaction, because if I don't, I can get a little bogged down and a little depressed". Scruggs also wanted to play concerts in venues that normally featured rock and roll acts. Columbia Records executives told Flatt and Scruggs that they intended to try a new producer, Bob Johnston, instead of their long-time producer Don Law. Johnston had produced Bob Dylan's records. This new association produced Changin' Times, Nashville Airplane, and The Story of Bonnie and Clyde albums. [...] Flatt was not happy with some of this material — he didn't like singing Bob Dylan songs and refused to perform them, saying [...] "I can't sing Bob Dylan stuff, I mean. Columbia has got Bob Dylan, why did they want me?". Even the success of the Bonnie and Clyde album was not enough to prevent their breakup in 1969. After the split, Flatt formed a traditional bluegrass group with Curly Seckler and Marty Stuart called The Nashville Grass, and Scruggs formed the Earl Scruggs Revue with his sons.|$|E
2500|$|H. P. Lovecraft {{held the}} book in very high regard (though {{he did not say}} whether it {{influenced}} any of his own stories), saying in a 1936 letter to Fritz Leiber [...] "no one ought to miss reading W. Olaf Stapledon's Last and First Men ... Probably you have read it. If not, make a bee line for library or bookstall!", and in another 1936 letter to Leiber [...] "I'm glad to hear of your perusal of Last and First Men—a volume which to my mind forms the greatest of all achievements in the field that Master Ackerman would denominate [...] "scientifiction". Its scope is dizzying—and despite a somewhat disproportionate acceleration of the tempo toward the end, and a few scientific inferences which might legitimately be challenged, it remains a thing of unparalleled power. As you say, it has the truly basic quality of a myth, and some of the episodes are of matchless poignancy and dramatic intensity." [...] Finally, in a 1937 letter to Arthur Widner he said [...] "I don't care for science fiction of the sort published in cheap magazines. There's no vitality in it—merely dry theories tacked on to shallow, unreal, insincere juvenile adventure stories. But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>like</b> the few real masterpieces in the field—certain of H. G. Wells's novels, S. Fowler Wright's The World Below, & that marvellous piece of imagination by W.

It was {{revealed}} by Perez Hilton that the band had been working with Demi Lovato in the recording studio. It was revealed that Sean Paul would feature on the album. When the band were introducing themselves to the American public, Rochelle Humes said she was the [...] "mum of the group", they call Mollie King the [...] "Disney characters" [...] although she said [...] "I'm not.

King revealed that the band had written most of the songs on the album, which they were most excited about. The band {{said that they}} would like to bring [...] "girl power" [...] back to the US like the Spice Girls did. King said: [...] "Since the Spice Girls there hasn't been a British girlband to make it in the US, it would be nice for us to bring a little girl power into the scene." [...] However, fellow girl group Little Mix's debut album, DNA, set new records for a British girl group in the US in June 2013. Healy said she was [...] "overwhelmed" [...] with the people she has got the chance to work with on the album.|$|E
2500|$|Portrait of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge is {{the first}} {{official}} portrait of the Duchess. Emsley, originally of South Africa and a 2007 recipient of the BP Portrait Award, had previously painted portraits of Nelson Mandela and Naipaul. In a video interview for The Daily Telegraph, Emsley suggested that beginning he was thrilled to receive the commission. [...] "Slowly" [...] he says he realized {{the importance of the}} project was, not just for himself, but for many others, making him slightly nervous. He was keen to capture Catherine's [...] "charm, serenity and intelligence" [...] and [...] "sparkling green eyes". The Duchess sat for him twice—for a day's session in May at the artist's studio in Bradford-upon-Avon, and a brief session in June at Kensington Palace, where he did quick drawings and took more photographs—and he used photographs to assist him. He describes her during the process as [...] "quite amenable". According to Emsley, Catherine had asked for herself to be painted naturally, as opposed to her official self." [...] It shows Catherine wearing a bottle green pussy bow blouse, looking straight out from the picture, smirking, rather than grinning. The artist noted that, if too defined, smiling portraiture occasionally may [...] "look like caricatures". Emsley darkened the eyes slightly to match her tunic; the background is also shaded in a similar hue of dark green. Emsley was also keen {{to draw attention to the}} rich texture of her hair. Talking to the BBC after criticism of his work, he noted that he didn't want to overwhelm her face. Emsley said, [...] "I don't have lots of things in the background. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>like</b> large faces, I find them strong and contemporary. I'm interested in the landscape of the face, the way in which light and shadow fall across the forms. That's really my subject matter. To have anything else in there is really just an interference." [...] As Catherine's image [...] "is so pervasive", he told the media he needed to go past the image on his mind.|$|E
