In practice, most airports generally use as many <b>deicing</b> fluids as possible to remove the ice, which causes the waste of the <b>deicing</b> fluids and the pollution of the environment. Therefore, the model of aircraft ground <b>deicing</b> should be built to establish the foundation for the subsequent research, such as the optimization of the <b>deicing</b> fluid consumption. In this article, the heat balance of the <b>deicing</b> process is depicted, and the dynamic model of the <b>deicing</b> process is provided based on the analysis of the <b>deicing</b> mechanism. In the dynamic model, the surface temperature of the <b>deicing</b> fluids and the ice thickness are regarded as the state parameters, while the fluid flow rate, the initial temperature, and the injection time of the <b>deicing</b> fluids are treated as control parameters. Ignoring the heat exchange between the <b>deicing</b> fluids and the environment, the simplified model is obtained. The rationality of the simplified model is verified by the numerical simulation and the impacts of the flow rate, the initial temperature and the injection time on the <b>deicing</b> process are investigated. To verify the model, the semi-physical experiment system is established, consisting of the low-constant temperature test chamber, the ice simulation system, the <b>deicing</b> fluid heating and spraying system, the simulated wing, the test sensors, and the computer measure and control system.

40|$|Alkali acetate based deicers {{have been}} found to cause {{significant}} distress in airfield concrete pavements, allegedly by a mechanism similar to conventional Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR). Prior research indicated that aggregates having a history of being susceptible to ASR may undergo active deterioration when exposed to alkali acetate deicers. Further, <b>deicer</b> exposure was suspected to cause changes in the CSH gel composition by formation of secondary reaction products. Preliminary laboratory investigations had shown that the conditions conducive to triggering ASR could mainly be attributed to a drastic increase (jump) in the pH of the deicing solution, which occurs when it comes in contact with calcium hydroxide. The focus {{of this study was to}} further investigate the interaction between potassium acetate <b>deicer</b> solution and concrete components in an attempt to gain a better perspective of the reaction mechanism and its relevance with respect to the distress observed in the field. Thus, the broad objectives of this study included a detailed laboratory-based investigation into the influence of deicers on concrete microstructure and also a forensic investigation of cores collected from selected airports whose deicing operations predominantly involved application of potassium acetate <b>deicer.</b> ^ The fundamental part of the investigation involved utilizing techniques such as pore solution analysis and SEM-EDX to study the deleterious interaction of potassium acetate <b>deicer</b> solution on cementitious systems. In addition, experiments were conducted to verify the “pH jump” phenomenon, monitor mortar bar expansions and to study the influence of the <b>deicer</b> solution on the stability of siliceous aggregates. Based on the results of comparative experiments performed using reactive as well as non-reactive aggregates, it was concluded that in accelerated laboratory conditions the potassium acetate <b>deicer</b> could induce ASR in test specimens containing reactive aggregates. Further, microscopic evaluation revealed the formation of a calcium-bearing potassium sulfate phase as a result of the chemical interaction between potassium acetate <b>deicer</b> and hydrated cement paste. ^ The forensic investigation component of the study comprised of a thorough microscopic investigation of field cores and determination of the profile of <b>deicer</b> penetration into the pavement. The results indicated more or less uniform level of damage throughout the depth of the pavement with no appreciable penetration of the <b>deicer</b> into the pavement.

The present study is related to the treatment of glycol-contaminated wastewaters by the activated sludge process. The specific objectives of the research were to: (1) determine the effects of process parameters such as biomass concentration, <b>deicing</b> fluid concentration and temperature on the biodegradation kinetics. (2) determine the mechanism of <b>deicing</b> fluid removal and model the reaction rates. (3) determine the effects of microbial changes on the treatment process.

(5) corroborate our laboratory results with field data from an operating wastewater facility treating <b>deicing</b> wastes. The results from the field show that despite the increases in influent organic matter during the <b>deicing</b> season, there were very little changes in effluent values of organic matter. Furthermore, influent concentrations of <b>deicing</b> fluid between 10 and 30 mg/L were reduced to trace amounts (i. e. below 5 mg/L) throughout the <b>deicing</b> season. However, as witnessed by the high sludge volume index during the <b>deicing</b> season, the presence of <b>deicing</b> fluid creates settling problems in the clarifier. The laboratory batch experiments indicate optimal substrate removal rates at biomass concentrations of 1000 mg/L and 2000 mg/L. Very low biomass levels lead to inhibition whereas a high biomass level of 3000 mg/L is unnecessary since the food to microorganism ratio is such that {{only a fraction of the}} biomass participates in the degradation reaction. With regards to <b>deicing</b> fluid concentration, organic matter removal rates tend to increase as the <b>deicing</b> fluid is increased. However, at the highest level of <b>deicing</b> fluid, certain inhibitory effects are present. As expected, higher temperatures produce much higher removal rates with the ethylene glycol substrate showing less variation with temperature than the other organic compounds present in the wastewater. With regards to the mechanism of removal, the results showed very little adsorption of organic matter onto the biomass within the first hour of contact. In addition, the total organic matter removal (TOC and COD) followed first order kinetics with respect to substrate concentration. Lastly, sequencing batch reactor operation allowed for much higher removal rates as the microbial population is acclimatized to the substrate with increasing cycles. With regards to the microbial population, the Biolog results showed that there was a decrease in the variety of compounds that could be degraded as the biomass was exposed to the <b>deicing</b> fluid.
