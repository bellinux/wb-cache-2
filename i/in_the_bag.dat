5|$|In Hyderabad, Gautham accidentally spoils Sameera's {{birthday}} plans, infuriating her. Although he {{is convinced}} {{that he has made}} up an enemy to cope with being an orphan, a mysterious person tries to kill Sameera. Gautham saves her and proposes marriage, which she accepts. Sameera learns that the mysterious person is Antonio Rosarios, a Goa-based crime boss who wants to kill her because she tried to expose the presence of hydrogen cyanide in seeds sold by Rosarios' company, AG1. Gautham meets Rosarios in the lobby of Sameera's office building. Assuming that he is an illusion, he shoots Rosarios in his head. By the time Gautham realises Rosarios is real he is dead, and Gautham learns that his parents were murdered. He catches an aged taxi driver who was stalking him (one of the three men he imagined), and learns that two London-based Indians (one of whom was Rosarios) killed his parents; his father gave the taxi driver a bag to give to Gautham. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> is an old Rubik's Cube, a key and a British coin.|$|E

40|$|In two {{experiments}} lasting 4 to 6 weeks, {{communities of}} North Sea coastal plankton kept in separate plastic bags (of about 1400 l) and {{exposed to the}} same environmental conditions showed very similar patterns of growth and decline. This result means that the method is suitable {{for the evaluation of}} toxic effects of environmental pollutants at low concentrations on complex plankton systems. <b>The</b> phytoplankton <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> produced a succession of blooms, which were probably limited by shortage of nutrients. The dominant zooplankton organisms were various species of copepods which can develop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> from egg to adult. Strong indications were found that mineralization of organic matter occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bags.</b> Chemical parameters and phytoplankton biomass were found not to be stratified, indicating that the contents of <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> were well mixed. © 1977 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

25|$|Many {{of those}} were Haganah members, and several of them asked what was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bags.</b> <b>The</b> Irgun members lied, saying that <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> {{contained}} guns, at which point some of the workers suggested {{that they should be}} confiscated.

25|$|Once {{cleaned and}} dried the silver is wrapped in acid-free tissue paper {{and placed in}} a sealed plastic bag. A 3M anti-tarnish strip is also placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> to absorb any sulfur that may be in the air.

25|$|In June 2003, the {{presiding}} judge, Kenji Kadoya, {{who had never}} found a defendant innocent in a career spanning more than a decade, found Baker guilty. He said Baker must have known {{the contents of the}} case because he had carried the key and had told customs officials and prosecutors that the case belonged to him. The judge also noted a signed confession, which implied Baker knew he was carrying drugs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ross' {{attorneys}} made a pretrial {{motion to}} suppress the evidence found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> and the pouch {{on the grounds that}} the warrantless search of the car does not extend to searching closed containers found within. That motion was denied, but on appeal the D.C. Circuit Court reversed that decision, holding that the warrantless search of the two closed bags was unconstitutional. The matter was appealed to the Supreme Court and argued before the court on March 1, 1982.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a novel {{technique}} for parallelizing data-classification problems {{is applied to}} finding genes in sequences of DNA.

40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{relatively}} inexpensive technique for defining {{the extent of}} groundwater contamination by tritium has been investigated. The technique uses existing vegetation to sample the groundwater. Water taken up by deep rooted trees is collected by enclosing tree branches in clear plastic bags. Water evaporated from the leaves condenses on the inner surface of <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b> <b>The</b> water is removed from <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> with a syringe. <b>The</b> <b>bags</b> can be sampled many times. Tritium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water is detected by liquid scintillation counting. <b>The</b> water collected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> has no color and counts as well as distilled water reference samples. The technique was used {{in an area of}} known tritium contamination and proved to be useful <b>in</b> defining <b>the</b> extent of tritium contamination...|$|R
25|$|A {{partially}} filled bag will accelerate as it ascends {{because the}} air <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> expands as the pressure reduces on the ascent, following Boyles law, increasing the bag's buoyancy, whereas a full bag will overflow or blow off excess volume {{and maintain the}} same volume and buoyancy providing is does not descend. A bag which leaks sufficiently to start sinking will lose volume to compression and become less buoyant in a positive feedback loop until stopped by the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Sulfur-containing {{gases and}} {{particulates}} can tarnish {{the surface of}} silver. These corrosive agents can come from air pollution, paints, textiles, bacterial by-products, and other chemically treated objects or building materials. When storing silver, museum conservators wrap silver in sulfur-free tissue paper and store in a tight sealed polyethylene bag. Activated charcoal is sometimes used to absorb sulfur by placing it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> but not {{in direct contact with}} the object. Likewise, Pacific Silver Cloth has also been used by museums to prevent tarnishing.|$|E
25|$|In 1907, American tea {{merchant}} Thomas Sullivan began distributing {{samples of}} his tea in small bags of Chinese silk with a drawstring. Consumers noticed they could simply leave the tea <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> and reuse it with fresh tea. However, {{the potential of}} this distribution/packaging method would not be fully realised until later on. During World War II, tea was rationed in the United Kingdom. In 1953 (after rationing in the UK ended), Tetley launched the tea bag to the UK {{and it was an}} immediate success.|$|E

25|$|A {{buoyancy}} assisted lift is {{a common}} procedure for recreational divers to assist {{the recovery of the}} shotline or anchor, which would otherwise be pulled up manually. A small lift bag attached to the shot is partially filled by the last diver to leave the bottom, and after surfacing the crew pull up the line and the air <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> expands as it ascends, providing more assistance to the crew. In this application a runaway lift is not usually a problem, and the bag size is not critical.|$|E
25|$|A {{teaching}} laboratory demonstration for {{the production}} of dry ice is to use a 15 lb aluminum carbon dioxide fire extinguisher with a porous fabric collecting bag over the nozzle. The Joule-Thomson expansion of the gas lowers the temperature enough to produce an approximate 50/50 mixture of CO2 gas and dry ice snow also called dust that is collected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b> This is an inefficient process, and unsuitable for even lab-scale production. The expansion is inefficient, fire extinguishers are an expensive way to buy carbon dioxide, especially when a signed and dated fire extinguisher certification is required.|$|E
