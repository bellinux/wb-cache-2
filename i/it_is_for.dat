5|$|In the {{parliamentary}} democracy of India, the ultimate responsibility for running the administration {{rests with the}} elected representatives of the people which are the ministers. But a handful of ministers cannot be expected to deal personally with the manifold problems of modern administration.

5|$|Intensity of {{precipitation}} is primarily measured for meteorological concerns. However, {{it can be}} of concern to aviation as heavy precipitation can limit visibility. Also, intensity of freezing rain can determine how hazardous <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> pilots to fly nearby certain locations since {{it can be an}} in-flight hazard by depositing ice on the wings of aircraft, which can be detrimental to flight.|$|E

5|$|Camak House, at 279 Meigs Street, Athens, Georgia, {{was built}} in about 1834 by James Camak and {{featured}} in Georgia's early railroad history. An example of Federal architecture, it {{has a number of}} features unusual for its period, including a kitchen within the raised basement and closets. Both main floors have four rooms; the stairwell has a mahogany railing, and moldings and trim were made using a Greek key pattern. After long service as a family home, it was used as a Masonic Lodge before being bought by Coca-Cola Enterprises. In 1975 Camak House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but the building had by then fallen into disrepair. It was restored and used as the offices of a law firm.

5|$|Every {{game in the}} SmackDown vs. Raw series used to {{have the}} amount of damage inflicted to the player's chosen superstar, {{measured}} with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a superstar, the affected area of the body flashed—the more damage that is done to that specific body part, the more likely <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> the superstar to submit. Colors were used to represent the amount of damage done to a specific body area; yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage. This was however taken out of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. Now {{the only way to}} tell how damaged the opponent is to watch their physical body actions that indicate how hurt they are. The more damage inflicted to opponents, the more likely <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> them to lose the match. There are four ways to win a match in every game: by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout; alternatively, the match could end in a draw. With the introduction of an on-screen referee in WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, the ability to win by disqualification was also included.|$|E

If there is a disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> legislative proposals.

Dunya had been working as a governess for the Svidrigaïlov family until this point, but was {{forced out of the}} {{position}} by the head of the family, Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigaïlov. Svidrigaïlov, a married man, was attracted to Dunya's physical beauty and her feminine qualities, and offered her riches and elopement. Mortified, Dunya fled the Svidrigaïlov family and lost her source of income, only to meet Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin, a man of modest income and rank. Luzhin proposes to marry Dunya, thereby securing her and her mother's financial safety, provided she accept him quickly and without question. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> these very reasons {{that the two of them}} come to Saint Petersburg, both to meet Luzhin there and to obtain Raskolnikov's approval. Luzhin, however, calls on Raskolnikov while he is in a delirious state and presents himself as a foolish, self-righteous and presumptuous man. Raskolnikov dismisses him immediately as a potential husband for his sister, and realizes that she only accepted him to help her family.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} {{mycorrhizal}} association with willow trees, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> this that {{the species is}} named.

I.saliceticola was first described in 2009, and within the genus Inocybe, the species {{is a part of}} the section Marginatae. The species has been recorded in Finland and Sweden and is relatively common in some areas.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} for forensic anthropologists {{to take into account}} all available markers in the determination of sex due to the differences that can occur between individuals of the same sex. For example, it is possible that a female may have a slightly more narrow than normal pubic arch. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> this reason that anthropologists usually classify sex as one of five possibilities: male, may be male, indeterminate, may be female, or female. In addition, forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a sex determination unless the individual was an adult at the time of death. The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during puberty and are not fully pronounced until after sexual maturation.|$|E
