5000|$|The Bonnet Carré Spillway {{consists}} of two basic components: a control structure along the east bank of the Mississippi River and a floodway that transfers the diverted flood waters to the lake. The control structure is a mechanically-controlled concrete weir that extends for over {{a mile and a}} half parallel to the river. When opened, the control structure allows overflow volume to flow into Lake Pontchartrain. The lake's opening to the gulf is sufficient to absorb and dissipate any conceivable volume of flood flow. Thus, the <b>flood</b> <b>surcharge</b> portion of the water from the Mississippi is divided between the main river and the diversion channel; with the surcharge bypassing the New Orleans metropolitan area, resulting in the Mississippi being lower (through that area) than it could have been; and reducing the stress on the area's levees that line the river. Confined by guide levees, the floodway stretches nearly six miles (10 km) to Lake Pontchartrain, with a design capacity of [...] [...] The spillway is crossed by U.S. 61 and Interstate 10.|$|E

The first implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to correct flow-rate simulations from the WRIP simulator (Han, 1991) for hourly observations {{of a single}} flow-rate and to predict it up to 5 -hours in advance. Improvements in accuracy {{as compared with the}} WRIP output were clearly demonstrated. The second implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to act as a surrogate for the 3 DNet / SIPSON simulator (University of Belgrade, 2010), which uses a conventional fluid-dynamic approach to predict <b>flooding</b> <b>surcharge</b> levels in sewer networks. An MLP-based data-driven model is created to emulate the SIPSON outputs for a 123 -manhole sub-network from Keighley, West Yorkshire, UK under a range of rainstorm durations and return periods. A 3 -minute sampling period was used. Both a flood level analogue and a classification scheme were successfully implemented.

A 123 -manhole combined sewer sub-network from Keighley, West Yorkshire, UK is used to demonstrate the methodology. An ANN is configured for prediction of flooding at manholes based on rainfall. In the absence of actual flood data, the 3 DNet / SIPSON simulator, which uses a conventional fluid-dynamic approach to predict <b>flooding</b> <b>surcharge</b> levels in sewer networks, is employed to provide the target data for training the ANN. Artificial rainfall profiles derived from observed data provide the input. Both flood-level analogue and flood-severity classification schemes are implemented. We also investigate {{the use of an}} ANN for nowcasting of rainfall based on the relationship between radar data and recorded rainfall history. This allows the two ANNs to be cascaded to predict flooding in real-time based on weather radar...|$|R
40|$|Green {{highway is}} {{environmentally}} responsible and sustainable {{in all aspects}} {{and it is also}} related to the effort to leave the project area better than before in improving safety and functionality. There are many elements to be considered in order to develop the green highway index. Storm water management is one of the important scopes to establish the green highway index. In fact, improper management on storm water for highway infrastructure will create significant problem such as <b>flooding,</b> <b>surcharge</b> and channel system blockage. As a result, it creates dangerous environment to road users when water ponding on the road surface. The environmental friendly approach should be applied when dealing with storm water runoff. Therefore, this study is focusing on storm water management towards developing the green road index. The current approach will be highlighted in this study starting from reviewing the literature, develop the questionnaire and thus distribute the designed questionnaire to the respondents. This study consists of survey and interview according to the design questionnaire related to green highway criteria. The collected data has been analyzed by using SPSS score index and statistical analysis. The finding of this study is storm water management criteria and element which contributing for new green highway development has been established.

50|$|The {{original}} {{system was}} designed to cope with 6.5 mm (1/4") per hour of rainfall within the catchment area, and supported a smaller population than today's. London's growth has {{put pressure on the}} capacity of the sewerage system. During storms, for example, high levels of rainfall (in excess of 6 mm per hour) {{in a short period of}} time can overwhelm the system. Sewers and treatment works are unable to cope with the large volumes of rainwater entering the system. Rainwater mixes with sewage in combined sewers and excess mixed water is discharged into the Thames. If this does not happen quickly enough, localised <b>flooding</b> occurs (<b>surcharge).</b> Such sanitary sewer overflow can mean streets becoming flooded with a mixture of water and sewage, causing a health risk.|$|R

A time-lagged ANN is configured for prediction of flooding at sewerage nodes and outfalls based on input parameters including rainfall. In the absence of observed flood data, a hydrodynamic simulator {{may be used to}} predict <b>flooding</b> <b>surcharge</b> levels at nodes of interest in sewer networks and thus provide the target data for training and testing the ANN. The model, once trained, acts as a rapid surrogate for the hydrodynamic simulator and can thus be used as part of an urban flooding Early Warning System (EWS). Predicted rainfall over the catchment is required as input, to extend prediction times to operationally useful levels. Both flood-level analogue and flood-severity classification schemes are implemented. An initial case study using Keighley, W Yorks, UK demonstrated proof-of-concept. Three further case studies for UK cities of different sizes explore issues of soil-moisture, early operation of pumps as flood-mitigation/prevention strategy and spatially variable rainfall. We investigate the use of ANNs for nowcasting of rainfall based on the relationship between radar data and recorded rainfall history; a feature extraction scheme is described. This would allow the two ANNs to be cascaded to predict flooding in real-time based on current weather radar Quantitative Precipitation Estimates (QPE).

40|$|The {{ability of}} urban {{drainage}} systems to operate satisfactorily under {{a wide range}} of possible future hydrologic conditions is an important system characteristic. As weather patterns shift, {{it is important to understand}} how local infrastructure may be affected as extreme rainfall events have the potential to cause direct and indirect damages to communities. Continuous simulation in SWMM 5. 1 coupled with synthetic precipitation files generated using GCM outputs were used to assess the risk-based performance in terms of reliability, resiliency and vulnerability of an urban drainage system in the City of Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The study drainage network investigated in this paper never experienced a <b>flooding</b> or <b>surcharging</b> event (i. e. 100 % system reliability), however, an observed positive trend in the ratio of conduit depth to full depth over time indicates the potential for unsatisfactory system performance in the future as a result of changing hydrologic conditions due to climate change...|$|R
5000|$|Old Hickory Reservoir is [...] long lying between Nashville and Carthage. The {{reservoir}} {{is essentially}} a run-of-river type without regulating storage other than for incidental <b>flood</b> control through <b>surcharge</b> operation, and for pondage for power generation and lockages; hence, low water flow of the river will be increased only indirectly through the use and passage of discharges from upstream plants. Such releases, however, result in a more sufficient and higher quality of water for domestic and industrial consumption and use are effective in pollution abatement downstream. Due to the fairly constant level maintained under normal operating conditions, the reservoir is well suited for conservation and recreational purposes. Beginning in 2007, the multi-year altered flow and water temperatures resulting from the emergency maintenance on the Wolf Creek Dam affected Old Hickory like the other Cumberland River reservoirs and resulted in modifications about environmental management.|$|R
40|$|Cities are {{becoming}} increasingly vulnerable to flooding because of rapid urbanization, installation of complex infrastructure, {{and changes in the}} precipitation patterns caused by anthropogenic climate change. This is partly because of decreasing volumetric rainfall trends {{in many parts of the}} world, which might have severe effects on reservoir yields and operational practices. In addition, more frequent and more severe intensity rainfall events can cause substantial urban inundation problems. For many cities in the world, future projections of climate change impacts on extreme short-duration rain showers and urban drainage show significant increases in the frequency of sewer <b>surcharge,</b> <b>flooding</b> and overflow spills. At the same time, due to the difficulties and uncertainties in climate change impact modelling and analysis on the urban scales, caution must be exercised when interpreting climate change scenarios. These uncertainties can however not be used as an argument for not taking determined actions. Instead, uncertainties should be accounted for and flexible and sustainable solutions aimed at. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) {{constitute}} {{an alternative to}} conventional drainage when managing stormwater in cities, reducing the impact of urbanization by decreasing the amount of runoff generated by a rainfall event. This paper shows {{the potential benefits of}} installing different types of SuDS in preventing flooding in comparison with the common urban drainage strategies consisting of sewer networks of manholes and pipes. The impact of these systems on urban water was studied using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which are useful tools when both delineating catchments and parameterizing the elements that define a stormwater drainage system. Taking these GIS-based data as inputs, a series of rainfall-runoff simulations were run in a real catchment located in the city of Donostia (Northern Spain) using stormwater computer models, in order to compare the flow rates and depths produced by a design storm before and after installing SuDS. The proposed methodology overcomes the lack of precision found in former GIS-based stormwater approaches when dealing with the modeling of highly urbanized catchments, while the results demonstrated the usefulness of these systems in reducing the volume of water generated after a rainfall event and their ability to prevent localized <b>flooding</b> and <b>surcharges</b> along the sewer network.

The paper relates to the regulatory background of European Standard EN 762 and the need of a more detailed methodology to simulate urban flooding. The analysis of urban <b>flooding</b> caused by <b>surcharged</b> sewers in urban drainage systems leads to the necessity of a dual drainage modeling. A detailed dual drainage simulation model is described based upon hydraulic flow routing procedures for surface flow and pipe flow. Special consideration is given to the interaction between surface and sewer flow during surcharge conditions in order to most. accurately compute water levels above ground as a basis for further assessments of possible damage costs. The model application is presented for a small case study in terms of data needs, model verification and first simulation results...|$|R

40|$|Under the {{umbrella}} of the IWA/IAHR Joint Committee on Urban Drainage, the International Working Group on Urban Rainfall (IGUR) has reviewed existing methodologies {{for the analysis of}} long-term historical and future trends in urban rainfall extremes and their effects on urban drainage systems, due to anthropogenic climate change. Current practises have several limitations and pitfalls, which are important to be considered by trend or climate change impact modellers and users of trend/impact results. The review considers the following aspects: - Analysis of long-term historical trends due to anthropogenic climate change: influence of data limitation, instrumental or environmental changes, interannual variations and longer term climate oscillations on trend testing results. - Analysis of long-term future trends due to anthropogenic climate change: by complementing empirical historical data with the results from physically-based climate models, dynamic downscaling to the urban scale by means of Limited Area Models (LAMs) including explicitly small-scale cloud processes; validation of RCM/GCM results for local conditions accounting for natural variability, limited length of the available time series, difference in spatial scales, and influence of climate oscillations; statistical downscaling methods combined with bias correction; uncertainties associated with the climate forcing scenarios, the climate models, the initial states and the statistical downscaling step; uncertainties in the impact models (e. g. runoff peak flows, <b>flood</b> or <b>surcharge</b> frequencies, and CSO frequencies and volumes), including the impacts of more extreme conditions than considered during impact model calibration and validation. - Implications for urban drainage infrastructure design and management: upgrading of the urban drainage system as part of a program of routine and scheduled replacement and renewal of aging infrastructure; how to account for the uncertainties; flexible and sustainable solutions; adaptive approach that provides inherent flexibility and reversibility and avoids closing off options; importance of active learning.

40|$|The {{volume of}} the urban runoff is {{subjected}} to increase due to urbanization and climate change. The urbanisation plan for the catchment of Kjelsrud implies increasing the impervious surfaces in forms of roads and rooftops, in return this increases the generated runoff. The catchment area of 38 ha {{will be able to}} generate a considerable runoff volume of about 5069 l/s under current rainfall and 11406 l/s with climate change consideration. The goal of this thesis is t o provide VAV with two independent alternatives for the design of urban drainage system. The hydrologic performance of the two alternatives was used in relation to the systems response to the design storm. The first alternative is a pipe-based alternative; a SWMM model was used to evaluate the drainage system responses to both the current rainfall patterns and the expected increase due to climate change. The model shows high risk for <b>flooding</b> and manholes <b>surcharge</b> as the runoff exceeded the pipes designed capacity. The second alternative was the surface drainage open channel –based system, where stormwater mitigation structures (green-roof and detention ponds) were introduced to the catchment for their multi-functionality and ability to handle the runoff locally. The manual calculations for these structures provided with estimations about the hydrologic performance of these structures to adapt also with increase in the rainfall. The economic cost for suggested alternatives was considerable, but one can investigate further {{a combination of the two}} alternatives. Where the second alternative can be integrated into the first alternative to support the pipes and reduce the risk for flooding...|$|R
40|$|Runoff {{generation}} in cold regions {{is characterized by}} snowmelt contributions to runoff during the periods of thawing and changing runoff patterns due to frozen ground. This thesis project aimed at addressing these challenges by advancing the procedures for winter urban runoff computations and the assessment of control measures during the winter/spring period, when the snowmelt and frozen soils dominantly impact runoff {{generation in}} the current and future climates. In such considerations, contributions of green/pervious areas to runoff and stormwater drainage systems were found particularly important and were addressed {{in one of the}} study components by conducting sensitivity analysis of the runoff modelling tool used, the MIKE SHE model. For this purpose, four runoff generation scenarios were defined, including the baseline reference scenario, a future climate scenario with up-scaled precipitation, and two scenarios with widely different infiltration rates. The results showed that the variations of infiltration capacity and the precipitation magnitude largely influenced runoff generation and impacted on the drainage system. Such impacts were measured by the number of <b>flooded</b> nodes and <b>surcharged</b> pipes, which greatly increased with decreasing infiltration capacity (described by Ks= 1 × 10 - 10 m/s, which corresponds to the bedrock) and somewhat increased for increasing future precipitation (+ 20 %). Projection of future climatological parameters to 2100 (i. e. temperature, precipitation and maximum hourly precipitation) were obtained for investigating seasonal changes in the town of Kalmar (southern Sweden). The results indicated that the seasonal precipitation patterns would become more similar in all the seasons, and the winter period would experience more changes in runoff generation, which would require more attention in stormwater management with respect to both snowmelt simulation and considerations of frozen grounds. To advance the understanding of urban snowmelt modelling, a literature review of selected snowmelt models was undertaken to identify which of them could be readily used, or easily modified, for improving the current snow modelling practice. For this purpose an urban snow cover classification (13 classes) was developed {{on the basis of the}} following considerations: human activities affecting snowmelt, land use, and the origin of deposited snow. Various snow covers in urban areas were then assessed and general recommendations were made for selecting the most appropriate model for specific studies, considering the study goals, constraints on the collection of field data, budget/time restriction, and the required accuracy. Urban runoff controls by green infrastructures, during the cold season, were studied for green roofs and infiltration facilities. Green roofs were found to be effective in warm weather, when they could counterbalance almost all the extra rainfall imposed by climate change, in a mixed land use catchment in Luleå, retrofitted with green roofs covering 30 % of the catchment area. On the other hand, green roofs produced no benefits in the cold season with sub-zero temperatures and snow removal. Infiltration of runoff into two frozen engineered (sandy) soils, with slightly varying gradation, was studied in the laboratory for two values of the initial gravimetric water content (5 and 10 %). Soil thawing process and restoration of infiltration capacity was slowed down by increasing water content and the content of fines in the soil. Thus, the soil with higher water content and finer gradation required more time for attaining full infiltration capacity after soil thawing. Practical implications of study results for bioretention facilities include the recommended use of coarser engineered soils, conservative estimation of infiltration rates, provision for bypassing of high flows, and fitting the facility with a valve-controlled under-drain facilitating bioretention drainage before the onset of freezing weather.
