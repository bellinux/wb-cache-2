5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes {{an element of the}} ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E

Poultry producers routinely use nationally approved medications, such as antibiotics, in feed or drinking water, to treat disease or to prevent disease outbreaks.

25|$|Thought is {{a mental}} act that allows humans {{to make sense}} of things in the world, and to {{represent}} and interpret them <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> significant, or which accord with their needs, attachments, goals, commitments, plans, ends, desires, etc. Thinking involves the symbolic or semiotic mediation of ideas or data, as when we form concepts, engage in problem solving, reasoning, and making decisions. Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include deliberation, cognition, ideation, discourse and imagination.|$|E
25|$|Roman Catholic Marian art has {{expressed}} {{a wide range}} of theological topics that relate to Mary, often <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> far from obvious, and whose meaning can only be recovered by detailed scholarly analysis.

25|$|Historical examples, {{such as the}} {{hookworm}} {{campaigns in}} Mississippi and Florida from 1943 to 1947 {{have shown that the}} primary cause of hookworm infection is poor sanitation, which can be solved by building and maintaining toilets. But while these may seem like simple tasks, they raise important public health challenges. Most infected populations are from poverty-stricken areas with very poor sanitation. Thus, it is most likely that at-risk children {{do not have access to}} clean water to wash their hands and live in environments with no proper sanitation infrastructure. Health education, therefore, must address preventive measures <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> both feasible and sustainable in the context of resource-limited settings.|$|E
25|$|Although the Department {{recognizes that}} amparos are an {{integral}} aspect of Mexican law designed to protect individuals’ legal rights, the USCA is concerned that amparo appeals are being used excessively in Convention return cases, and that Mexico is allowing taking parents to use the amparo process to delay cases and influence the final outcome <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{not consistent with the}} principles of the Convention. The Department is encouraged by a recent decision by a Mexican federal judge, which overcame an amparo allowing a child to immediately return to the United States, and hopes this precedent will continue. By streamlining the amparo process in Convention cases, the Government of Mexico could better meet its treaty obligations.|$|E
25|$|Abstraction {{indicates}} {{a departure from}} reality in depiction of imagery in art. This departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete. Abstraction exists along a continuum. Even art that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree {{can be said to}} be abstract, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is likely to be exceedingly elusive. Artwork which takes liberties, altering for instance color and form <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> conspicuous, can be said to be partially abstract. Total abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable. In geometric abstraction, for instance, one is unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities. Figurative art and total abstraction are almost mutually exclusive. But figurative and representational (or realistic) art often contains partial abstraction.|$|E

25|$|Further critiques {{have emerged}} from feminist, constructionist and discursive sources. Key to these {{is the issue of}} power. In this regard there is a concern that clients are persuaded—both inside and outside the {{consulting}} room—to understand themselves and their difficulties <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> consistent with therapeutic ideas. This means that alternative ideas (e.g., feminist, economic, spiritual) are sometimes implicitly undermined. Critics suggest that we idealize the situation when we think of therapy only as a helping relationship—arguing instead that it is fundamentally a political practice, in that some cultural ideas and practices are supported while others are undermined or disqualified, and that while it is seldom intended, the therapist–client relationship always participates in society's power relations and political dynamics. A noted academic who espoused this criticism was Michel Foucault.|$|E
25|$|The color {{variations}} in the mimicked substrate and animal skin are similar. Depending on the species, the skin of cuttlefish responds to substrate changes in distinctive ways. By changing naturalistic backgrounds, the camouflage responses of different species can be measured. Sepia officinalis changes color to match the substrate by disruptive patterning (contrast {{to break up the}} outline), where as S. pharanonis matches the substrate by blending in. Although camouflage is achieved in different ways, and in an absence of color vision, both species change their skin colors to match the substrate. Cuttlefish adapt their own camouflage pattern <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> specific for a particular habitat. An animal could settle in the sand and appear one way, with another animal a few feet away in a slightly different microhabitat, settled in algae for example, will be camouflaged quite differently.|$|E
25|$|Advocates of {{indigenous}} rights have also criticized some of Toledo's efforts to jump-start the economy through investments, {{such as his}} support for the Camisea natural gas project and other projects that involved exploring or developing natural resources. These critics claim that companies buy land at unreasonable prices, force indigenous people off of land that is historically theirs, and exploit natural resources <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> harmful to communities and the environment. Peru {{is one of the largest}} producers of gold, silver, and zinc in Latin America, and some critics complain about the priority the Peruvian government gives to mining as opposed to industries like fishing and agriculture, with which indigenous peoples are more familiar. They note that mining companies may bring new jobs to rural areas, but that they are not jobs for which natives are well qualified.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two major}} textual {{variants}} of Luke–Acts, the Western text-type and the Alexandrian. The oldest complete Alexandrian manuscripts date from the 4th century and the oldest Western ones from the 6th, with fragments and citations {{going back to the}} 3rd. Western texts of Acts are 6.2–8.4% longer than Alexandrian texts, the additions tending to enhance the Jewish rejection of the Messiah {{and the role of the}} Holy Spirit, <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> stylistically different from the rest of Acts. These conflicts suggest that Luke–Acts was still being substantially revised well into the 2nd century. The majority of scholars prefer the Alexandrian (shorter) text-type over the Western as the more authentic, but this same argument would favour the Western over the Alexandrian for the gospel of Luke, as in that case the, Western version is the shorter. The debate therefore continues.|$|E
25|$|Climate {{change could}} have {{significant}} impacts on water resources {{around the world}} because of the close connections between the climate and hydrological cycle. Rising temperatures will increase evaporation and lead to increases in precipitation, though there will be regional variations in rainfall. Both droughts and floods may become more frequent in different regions at different times, and dramatic changes in snowfall and snow melt are expected in mountainous areas. Higher temperatures will also affect water quality <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not well understood. Possible impacts include increased eutrophication. Climate change could also mean an increase in demand for farm irrigation, garden sprinklers, and perhaps even swimming pools. There is now ample evidence that increased hydrologic variability and change in climate has and will continue have {{a profound impact on}} the water sector through the hydrologic cycle, water availability, water demand, and water allocation at the global, regional, basin, and local levels.|$|E
25|$|Leader-focused {{approaches}} look to organizational {{leaders to}} determine the characteristics of effective leadership. According to the trait approach, more effective leaders possess certain traits that less effective leaders lack. More recently, this approach {{is being used to}} predict leader emergence. The following traits have been identified as those that predict leader emergence when there is no formal leader: high intelligence, high needs for dominance, high self-motivation, and socially perceptive. Another leader-focused approached is the behavioral approach which focuses on the behaviors that distinguish effective from ineffective leaders. There are two categories of leadership behaviors: (1) consideration; and (2) initiating structure. Behaviors associated with the category of consideration include showing subordinates they are valued and that the leader cares about them. An example of a consideration behavior is showing compassion when problems arise in or out of the office. Behaviors associated with the category of initiating structure include facilitating the task performance of groups. One example of an initiating structure behavior is meeting one-on-one with subordinates to explain expectations and goals. The final leader-focused approach is power and influence. To be most effective a leader should be able to influence others to behave <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> in line with the organization's mission and goals. How influential a leader can be depends on their social power or their potential to influence their subordinates. There are six bases of power: coercive power, reward power, legitimate power, expert power, referent power, and informational power. A leader can use several different tactics to influence others within an organization. These common tactics include: rational persuasion, inspirational appeal, consultation, ingratiation, exchange, personal appeal, coalition, legitimating, and pressure.|$|E
