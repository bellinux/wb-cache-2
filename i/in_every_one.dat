5|$|Having {{finished}} third in the league in May 2003, Given and Newcastle lost 4–3 on penalties to Partizan Belgrade early in the 2003–04 season, meaning that Newcastle failed to reach the group stages of the Champions League. The club instead qualified for the UEFA Cup, where they reached the semi-finals. A fifth-place finish in the league meant that the club qualified for the following season's UEFA Cup competition. Given played <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> of the club's league matches for a third successive season, as well as all 13 European games.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth grew camellias <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> of her gardens, {{and before}} her flag-draped coffin {{was taken from}} Windsor to lie in state at Westminster Hall, an {{arrangement}} of camellias from her own gardens was placed on top. An estimated 200,000 people over three days filed past as she lay in state in Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster. Members of the household cavalry and other branches {{of the armed forces}} stood guard at the four corners of the catafalque. At one point, her four grandsons Prince Charles, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Viscount Linley mounted the guard as a mark of respect—an honour similar to the Vigil of the Princes at the lying in state of King George V.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{spent two}} months {{recovering}} from a knee injury in the build-up to the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. Morgan made her first start at the World Cup Finals as the US defeated Nigeria 1–0 in the last group match to advance as group winners. She registered her only goal of the World Cup's knockout stage with the opener in the 2–0 last 16 win over Colombia. Morgan did, however, win penalties for the USWNT in the 2–0 victories against Colombia in the last 16 and Germany in the semi-finals, respectively. Morgan then started the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup Final as the USWNT defeated Japan 5–2 to win its third FIFA Women's World Cup. Morgan played in all seven World Cup Finals matches and started <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> of them since being restored to the starting XI against Nigeria.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{several hundred}} {{complete}} genomic sequences of Escherichia and Shigella species are available. The genome {{sequence of the}} type strain of E. coli {{has been added to}} this collection not before 2014. Comparison of these sequences shows a remarkable amount of diversity; only about 20% of each genome represents sequences present <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> of the isolates, while around 80% of each genome can vary among isolates. Each individual genome contains between 4,000 and 5,500 genes, but the total number of different genes among all of the sequenced E. coli strains (the pangenome) exceeds 16,000. This very large variety of component genes has been interpreted to mean that two-thirds of the E. coli pangenome originated in other species and arrived through the process of horizontal gene transfer.|$|E

25|$|Both the Chennai Super Kings and the Mumbai Indians {{were a part}} of the {{original}} eight teams of the Indian Premier League when its first season was held in 2008. From the first season, Chennai had been a formidable, well-balanced team with a strong lineup of Indian players, including the captain of India Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Dhoni was bought for US$1.5 million, the highest of the 2008 auction, and appointed their captain. They immediately became runners-up in 2008 and had continued to appear in every knockout/playoff stage since. They were the most successful IPL team, being twice champions and twice runners-up in the IPL and also the winners of the 2010 Champions League Twenty20. Apart from Dhoni, their most recognised player is Suresh Raina, who has played <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> of Chennai's matches and holds the record for most career runs in the IPL. Chennai's squad is batting oriented, largely consisting of specialist batsmen and all-rounders in favour of specialist bowlers.|$|E
