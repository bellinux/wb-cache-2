Results: The drying time&# 13; decreased within the increasing of drying temperature and <b>drying</b> <b>air</b> velocity. <b>Drying</b> <b>air</b> velocity&# 13; affected the drift and continuously moves of chili particle outward from dryer chamber under&# 13; continuous fluidized-bed technique. The decreasing of moisture content effected with increasing of a&# 13; compound capsaicin of dried chili compare to fresh chili.

5|$|Hurricane Carlos was {{an unusually}} small {{tropical}} cyclone which affected the western coast of Mexico in June2015. Forming {{as the third}} named storm and hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Carlos developed from a trough first noted by the National Hurricane Center on June7. The disturbance gradually organized and was designated as a tropical depression three days later while south of the Mexican Pacific coast. Drifting slowly northwestward, the depression was upgraded further to a tropical storm. Although persistent wind shear and <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> hampered intensification early on, Carlos strengthened into a hurricane on June13 after moving into a more favorable environment. However, the return of <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> and upwelling of cooler waters caused the system to deteriorate into a tropical storm. Paralleling the Mexican coast, Carlos later regained hurricane intensity on June15 and attained peak winds of 90mph (150km/h) a day later. The reprieve was brief, however, as the onset of wind shear, land interaction, and <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> afterward led to rapid weakening. On June17, Carlos degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure, having made landfall in Jalisco earlier that day. By the morning of June18, Carlos was declared to have completely dissipated.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Danny in August2015 was {{the first}} major {{hurricane}} to develop between the Lesser Antilles and Western Africa since Hurricane Julia in 2010. The hurricane originated from a well-defined tropical wave that emerged over the Atlantic Ocean on August14. Traveling west, the system gradually coalesced into a tropical depression by August18. After becoming a tropical storm later that day, <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> slowed further development. On August20–21, <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> became removed from the system, and Danny rapidly intensified into a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.

It degenerated into a tropical wave as it traversed the archipelago on August24 and was last noted over Hispaniola the following day.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this research, {{thin layer}} solar drying of Cuminum cyminum grains was {{conducted}} {{by means of a}} solar cabinet dryer. This system was employed in two drying states (mixed and indirect) and four levels of <b>drying</b> <b>air</b> flow rates (f: passive and f, f, f: active). The average initial moisture content of the plant for all 1 2 3 4 drying tests were about 43 % on dry basis and the drying was performed continuously, in each test, for a period of 90 min. Drying rate of different drying methods as well as thermal efficiency of solar collector were obtained. The effects of <b>drying</b> <b>air</b> flow rates and drying methods are highly significant on final moisture content of Cuminum cyminum. Natural convection solar drying was selected as the best <b>drying</b> <b>air</b> flow rate because the product has fewer moisture content in each drying time. However, mixed mode has less moisture content comparison with indirect type in the same time. Finally, natural convection solar <b>drying</b> <b>air</b> flow rate in mixed mode was selected as the best drying method for drying of Cuminum cyminum grains.

5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of <b>dry</b> <b>air,</b> known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the drying characteristics, milling quality, and functional properties of rough rice subjected to single-pass drying while controlling kernel material states. Drying experiments were conducted at 60, 70, and 80 C and relative humidities ranging from 13 to 83 %. High <b>drying</b> <b>air</b> relative humidities (greater than 63 %) maintained both the kernel surface and core in a rubbery state during drying, whereas low <b>drying</b> <b>air</b> relative humidities caused rapid transitioning of the surface layers from a rubbery to a glassy state. Long-grain pureline cultivar, Wells, medium-grain pureline cultivar, Jupiter, and long-grain hybrid cultivar, CL XL 729, were dried from harvest moisture content to 12. 5 % moisture content in a single-pass. Immediately after drying, samples were tempered in the drying container or in sealed plastic bags at the <b>drying</b> <b>air</b> temperature for 0, 30, and 60 min, after which they were spread in thin layers and cooled to ambient conditions. For all <b>drying</b> <b>air</b> temperatures and tempering conditions, milling quality was not significantly different from the controls when the relative humidity of the <b>drying</b> <b>air</b> was maintained above 63 % (both the kernel core and surface maintained in a rubbery state during drying) and rice was tempered immediately after drying in sealed plastic bags and at the <b>drying</b> <b>air</b> temperature for at least 60 min. Minimal reduction to milling quality was observed at the low drying-air relative humidities when samples were tempered immediately after drying in sealed plastic bags and at the <b>drying</b> <b>air</b> temperature for at least 60 min: tempering in containers having large headspaces or for shorter durations failed to reduce the intra-kernel stresses created during drying due to differences in material state between the surface and the core, thereby causing kernel fissuring and breakage during subsequent milling.

As a result, Jeanne weakened to a minimal hurricane midday on September 23, though it was forecast to re-intensify and attain major hurricane status. By early on September 24, the winds had decreased to 80mph (130km/h); its convection weakened in intensity, and the eyewall eroded due to <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> entrainment. However, as Jeanne moved toward an area of warmer waters, deep convection redeveloped around the eye.
