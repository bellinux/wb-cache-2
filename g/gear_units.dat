5|$|The Harrier was {{typically}} {{used as a}} ground attack aircraft, though its manoeuvrability also allows it to effectively engage other aircraft at short ranges. The Harrier {{is powered by a}} single Pegasus turbofan engine mounted in the fuselage. The engine is fitted with two air intakes and four vectoring nozzles for directing the thrust generated: two for the bypass flow and two for the jet exhaust. Several small reaction nozzles are also fitted, in the nose, tail and wingtips, for the purpose of balancing during vertical flight. It has two landing <b>gear</b> <b>units</b> on the fuselage and two outrigger landing <b>gear</b> <b>units,</b> one near each wing tip. The Harrier is equipped with four wing and three fuselage pylons for carrying a variety of weapons and external fuel tanks.|$|E

The helicopter began service with the United States Marine Corps in 1962, and with the Canadian military in 1963, and is used to carry cargo and combat troops.|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. Reliability is {{basically}} the measure of performance, it is {{the probability that a}} system or component will perform its required task without failure under certain conditions for a given period of time [1]. As systems have become more complex in recent time the need for reliability within that system has become more and more important, safety, productivity and profit are three factors that have also demanded an increased level of reliability [2]. The reliability of an industrial <b>gear</b> <b>unit</b> comes from the reliability of all the individual components within the <b>gear</b> <b>unit.</b> Bearing lives are often the limiting factor of a <b>gear</b> <b>unit</b> and more often than not the lubrication becomes contaminated through insufficient maintenance practices, operational practices and harsh environments. This then results in the premature bearing failures within the <b>gear</b> <b>unit.</b> If the <b>gear</b> <b>unit’s</b> “health” can be monitored and imminent failures are known then the unit can be taken out of service and replaced or repaired prior to failure and during scheduled maintenance periods, this will then reduce overall repair costs and drastically reduce unscheduled maintenance time and cost...|$|R

Although a <b>gear</b> <b>unit</b> is a complex dynamic model, its movement is usually periodical; faults and damages represent a disturbing quantity or impulse. Local and time changes in vibration signals indicate the disturbance [1, 2] {{and it is possible}} to expect time-frequency changes [3]. This idea is based on kinematics and operating characteristics [4, 5].|$|R

A water rudder provides steering in the water.|$|E
25|$|The F-111 used {{a three-point}} landing gear arrangement, with a two-wheel nose gear and two single-wheel main landing <b>gear</b> <b>units.</b> The landing gear {{door for the}} main gear, which was {{positioned}} {{in the center of}} the fuselage, also served as a speed brake in flight. Most F-111 variants included a terrain-following radar system connected to the autopilot. The aircraft was powered by two Pratt & Whitney TF30 afterburning turbofan engines. The F-111's variable-geometry wings, escape capsule, terrain following radar, and afterburning turbofans were new technologies for production aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The B6N1's Mamori 11 {{engine was}} found prone to severe {{vibrations}} and overheating at certain speeds {{and was at}} first judged too unreliable (an important consideration given that the plane was expected to fly long distances over open water). Following a series of modifications, though, the engine's performance was finally deemed promising enough that carrier acceptance trials were begun {{at the end of}} 1942. Subsequent test flights conducted aboard the carriers Ryuho and Zuikaku indicated the need to strengthen the tail hook mounting on the plane's fuselage.

2500|$|The {{complicated}} direct-injection engine, {{partly from}} its already basically compact design (no more than 3cm/1¼ inches larger in diameter than the Ki-43's 14-cylinder Nakajima Sakae radial) required {{a great deal}} of care in construction and maintenance and, as the Allies advanced toward the Japanese homeland, it became increasingly difficult to support the type's designed performance. Compounding reliability problems were the Allied submarine blockade which prevented delivery of crucial components, such as the landing gear. Many further landing <b>gear</b> <b>units</b> were compromised by the poor-quality heat treatment of late-war Japanese steel. Many Hayates consequently suffered strut collapses on landing. Further damage was caused by inadequately trained late war pilots, who sometimes found it difficult to transition to the relatively [...] "hot" [...] Ki-84 from the comparatively docile Ki-43 Hayabusa, which had a significantly lower landing speed.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1951, OKB-153 {{initiated}} {{the design of}} a twin-engined assault transport aircraft, designated DT-5/8 (Desahntno-Trahnsportnyy [...] – assault transport aircraft), to be powered by two Kuznetsov TV-2 turboprop engines, and fitted with a large rear cargo door to allow vehicles to be driven straight into the hold. On 11 December 1953, the Soviet Council of Ministers issued directive No.2922-1251 to the Antonov OKB, requiring them to build a twin-turboprop transport aircraft derived from the DT-5/8. Bearing the in-house designation Izdeliye P the resulting aircraft followed state-of-the-art practice with a high wing carrying two propeller engines, atop a rectangular-section fuselage, tricycle undercarriage with main <b>gear</b> <b>units</b> housed in pods {{on either side of the}} fuselage, and an upswept rear fuselage providing clearance of the tail unit for loading and unloading. After State acceptance trials, production was not recommended due to poor spin characteristics, directional stability and control issues, nosewheel shimmy, poor controllability when landing in crosswinds above 6m/s (12 kt) and also phugoid oscillations in all three axes which were difficult to control and made piloting the prototype tiring. As well as the aerodynamic faults, the TV-2 engines proved difficult to start with unstable gas dynamics at altitudes above 6,000 m (19,700ft).|$|E

40|$|The basic {{hypothesis}} {{of the paper}} is that machine part surfaces are membranes that divide inner and outer space, receive disturbance power from inner space and emit it to the surroundings. Additionally, machine systems operation causes numerous disturbances such as collisions, sliding, rolling, etc. Gear drives are a very interesting case for analysis of teeth impacts, which cause restorable free vibrations and spreading of disturbance power through elastic structure. The <b>gear</b> <b>unit</b> housing has a dominant role in the transformation of disturbance power and modulation of the sound emitted to the surroundings. This is an important detail for monitoring and diagnostics by emitted noise measurements. By combination of theoretical, numerical and experimental analyses, using a classical <b>gear</b> drive <b>unit</b> (reducer), this article explains the process of spreading disturbance power through the elastic structure, especially {{the role of the}} <b>gear</b> <b>unit</b> housing. Its role in the noise frequency spectrum modulation is determined by modal sensitivity to disturbances and noise isolation ability of the housing. The analysis of modal behavior of the housing and its modal shape excitation presents the main content of the paper...|$|R
