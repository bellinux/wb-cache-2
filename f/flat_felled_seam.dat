50|$|During the 1990s the <b>flats</b> <b>fell</b> into disrepair, and the Hackney Council {{decided it}} was time they were demolished.

50|$|However, Punggol 21 did not {{materialise}} {{fully as}} Singapore's economy {{was affected by}} the Asian economic crisis in 1997. Although construction began the next year, it was stopped when demand for new <b>flats</b> <b>fell</b> sharply. Plans were again delayed when the construction industry in Singapore experienced financial troubles in 2003. As a result, only some 16,000 flats, out of the 80,000 planned units, have been built as at 2007. There was only one shopping mall in the estate, Punggol Plaza, {{and there were no}} recreational facilities like cinemas or swimming pools. As of January 2016, a second shopping mall in the estate, Waterway Point, has opened, and recreational facilities have since been planned within the estate.|$|R
