40|$|This dollar cycle, the {{magnitude}} of which is entirely unprecedented by post-war experience, has had rather puzzling effects on <b>import</b> <b>prices.</b> Historically, movements in the real exchange rate have been passed through approximately one-for-one to the real <b>price</b> of <b>imports.</b> The rising dollar {{of the first half}} of the 1980 s did lead to lower real <b>prices</b> of <b>imported</b> goods, however, the two-year fall in the exchange rate has lead to only a slight increase in the real <b>import</b> <b>prices.</b> This puzzling behavior is interesting in itself. It takes on added importance, however, in that the sluggish rise of <b>import</b> <b>prices</b> has contributed to the persistence of the US trade deficit. This paper empirically investigates the hypothesis that hysteresis has occurred in US aggregate <b>import</b> <b>prices.</b> We review evidence based on standard ad hoc, pass-through equations, as well as evidence based on two structural models (the beachhead model, Baldwin 1986 and the bottleneck model, Foster and Baldwin 1986) which could account for the hysteretic behavior of <b>import</b> <b>prices...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the nominal exchange rate and <b>import</b> <b>prices</b> {{is central to the}} determination of inflation in a small open economy like Sweden. Since the pass-through of exchange rate changes to <b>import</b> <b>prices</b> appears to be affected {{by the size of the}} country, it may be expected to be higher in Sweden than what has been documented for major nations. Using the Johansen (1988) approach to cointegration, the long-run pass-through of exchange rate changes to <b>import</b> <b>prices</b> on manufactured goods is estimated to be 0. 6 - 0. 8. This is slightly higher than what is typically found for small countries.
