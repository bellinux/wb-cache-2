5|$|The United Nations ranks India as a middle-income country. Findings {{from the}} World Economic Forum {{indicate}} that India <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> {{countries in the}} world in terms of gender inequality. The 2011 United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report ranked India 132 out of 187 in terms of gender inequality. The value of this multidimensional indicator, Gender Inequality Index (GII) is determined by numerous factors including maternal mortality rate, adolescent fertility rate, educational achievement and labour force participation rate. Gender inequality in India is exemplified by women’s lower likelihood of being literate, continuing their education and participating in the labour force.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, and <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> rowdies on the island, {{and there is no}} power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E

500|$|Peléan eruptions (or nuée ardente) are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named after the volcano Mount Pelée in Martinique, {{the site of a}} massive Peléan eruption in 1902 that <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> natural disasters in history. In Peléan eruptions, a large amount of gas, dust, ash, and lava fragments are blown out the volcano's central crater, driven by the collapse of rhyolite, dacite, and andesite lava dome collapses that often create large eruptive columns. An early sign of a coming eruption is the growth of a so-called Peléan or lava spine, a bulge in the volcano's summit preempting its total collapse. The material collapses upon itself, forming a fast-moving pyroclastic flow (known as a block-and-ash flow) that moves {{down the side of the}} mountain at tremendous speeds, often over [...] per hour. These massive landslides make Peléan eruptions one of the most dangerous in the world, capable of tearing through populated areas and causing massive loss of life. The 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée caused tremendous destruction, killing more than 30,000 people and completely destroying the town of St. Pierre, the worst volcanic event in the 20th century.|$|E
500|$|Among reviewers {{who were}} {{negative}} towards the new installments was Maureen Ryan from the Chicago Tribune. The reviewer {{wrote that the}} [...] "gloomy, underwhelming Universe seems to have ditched many of the elements that the previous [...] "Stargate" [...] shows had, notably camaraderie {{and a sense of}} adventure, without adding {{much in the way of}} narrative suspense or complexity." [...] The only characters she felt were [...] "worth following" [...] were Eli Wallace (David Blue) and Nicholas Rush (Robert Carlyle). Vince Horiuchi from The Salt Lake Tribune started the review with [...] "Syfy Channel -- <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> displays of the genre on television," [...] and attacked the television series, [...] "Battlestar Galactica". Having no interest in the previous Stargate series' including the feature film, while not overall positive to the series, he said the cast and characters were a [...] "little more likable and interesting." [...] Reviewer Laura Freis from Variety magazine concluded her review with [...] "Sure, SGU is grittier, darker and psychologically deeper than previous versions. But so far, it's also a lot less fun." [...] While negative towards the show, she called Robert Carlyle an [...] "excellent" [...] actor. The Hollywood Reporter noted a lack of [...] "intelligent" [...] and [...] "surprising stories" [...] and was overall negative towards Stargate Universe, and even more so on the previous Stargate franchise releases.|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Silber from Space.com {{was very}} {{negative}} towards the episode, saying, [...] "This episode conveys {{a strong sense}} of a writer, director and actors merely going through the motions, collecting their sizable paychecks while running out the clock on the season and series. The plot is not compelling, the agents themselves seem not to take it seriously, and the doppelgangers around whom the action revolves are little more than ciphers." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two wrote, [...] "'Fight Club' is a marker for a series that seems to want to die now, please. [...] it's tonally one of the most atypical episodes the series ever made, conceived in spite and self-loathing and sheer exhaustion." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. Vitaris criticized the use of Kathy Griffin and asserted, [...] "the guest cast <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> ever. [...] Griffin [...] simply is not up to the task; she can not differentiate Betty and Lulu at all [...] and she reads every line as if she were still on her cancelled sitcom." [...] i09 reviewer Cyriaque Lama named [...] "The Kathy Griffin Twins" [...] the tenth [...] "Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters of the Week", and derided her performance as the Templeton twins. In 2016, in a ranking of all episodes of the series from best to worst, Vulture.com named [...] "Fight Club" [...] the worst episode of the series.|$|E

2500|$|White-nose {{syndrome}} <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> wildlife {{diseases in}} recent history that is currently decimating North American cave-hibernating bat populations. This epidemic is responsible for mass mortalities in hibernating North American bats, and {{is caused by a}} uniquely cold-adapted fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans. The fungus begins to grow on bats during the winter hibernation season, when bats are in torpor and immune-compromised. The body temperature of a hibernating bat is the optimal fungal growth environment. The fungus has affected 90% of species that hibernate in caves for the winter. Pseudogymnoascus destructans spores have been found growing on the Virginia big-eared bat. To date, no WNS mortality in this species has been observed although the syndrome has killed millions of its fellow cave-dwelling species. [...] It is currently thought that the Big Ears may have a natural immunity to WNS through a yeast that the bat 'combs' over their body that inhibits the growth of the WNS fungus.|$|E
2500|$|Only months old, the Reagan Administration {{announced}} {{its plans to}} sell five of the U.S.-made AWACS to Saudi Arabia. The proposal, part of the largest foreign arms sale ever was not received warmly on Capitol Hill where Congressional consent was required. The AWACS proposal was also harshly rejected by Israel and disapproved of {{by a majority of}} Americans. Upon formal introduction of the AWACS proposal to Congress in the fall of 1981, many Senators reacted coldly. [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> and most dangerous arms sales ever," [...] proclaimed Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy. Senator Donald Riegle said, [...] "We are being asked to submit to a kind of blackmail; the price gouging of oil." [...] These Senators feared that the AWACS sale was not designed to promote stability, as would be claimed by the Administration, but to secure U.S. oil resources. Such a deal would mean technology for oil access, and as Kennedy said, a potentially dangerous deal at that. Senator Bob Packwood, who as a Republican was a member of Reagan’s party, was also a leader of opposition to the AWACS deal in the Senate. Packwood spelled out the danger he saw in arming Saudi Arabia: [...] "They have displayed a hostility that must be interpreted as their deliberate intentions to promote continued instability in the Middle East." [...] Packwood questioned the choice of Saudi Arabia as an arbiter of peace saying, [...] "Let’s think about which nations have been seriously committed to negotiating peace in the Middle East and which have not shared that commitment." [...] With the recently ended American hostage crisis in Iran fresh in mind, Americans were reluctant to sell military equipment to anyone. In fact, a May 1981 poll showed that 52% of those surveyed opposed arms sales to any country, and only 19% wanted the U.S. to sell AWACS to Saudi Arabia.|$|E
