However, little empirical research has been conducted which would quantify the environmental benefits of wind power. In this paper, I quantify the <b>emissions</b> <b>offset</b> by wind power for a large electricity grid in Texas using observed production behavior.

40|$|ABSTRACT / This article {{describes}} and illustrates an account-ing method {{to assess and}} compare “early ” carbon sequestra-tion investments and trades {{on the basis of}} the number of standardized CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>offset</b> credits they will provide.

The number of credits associated with carbon sequestra-tion needs to account for time, risk, durability, permanence, additionality, and other factors that future trade regulators will most certainly use to assign “official ” credits to sequestration projects. The method that is presented here uses established principles of natural resource accounting and conventional rules of asset valuation to “score ” projects.

Or did {{you know that}} three million people die every year because of outdoor pollution made by vehicles and factories? Most companies have some sort of environmental policy that aims to reduce waste and pollution, but there are few that aim to become a climate neutral business. Our study has the intention to find out why some companies are willing to do something extra for the environment by voluntary compensate for their <b>emissions</b> through carbon <b>offsets.</b> Previous research has shown that {{there is a lack of}} understanding regarding the motivations to reduce emissions and that there is a need for studies to find out motivations for why companies buy voluntary carbon offsets, which leads us to our problem definition: What motivates companies to buy voluntary <b>emission</b> <b>offsets?</b> We developed four sub-purposes that helped us in our journey towards an answer to our research question. These were: identify incentives for <b>emission</b> <b>offsetting,</b> important aspects when evaluating which projects to support, if and how companies are communicating their offsetting activities and whether the possibility of buying <b>emission</b> <b>offsets</b> reduce incentives for companies to decrease their own emissions. Our degree project is written on commission for Respect Climate, a sustainability consultancy that operates in the area of Scandinavia. They help their customers to reduce their emissions, make climate calculations and <b>offset</b> <b>emissions.</b> Our aim with our conclusions of our degree project is to help Respect Climate to market their services to potential customers. As our degree project focuses on underlying motivations behind their customers’ behavior, we have chosen to do a qualitative study. First we implemented two interviews with employees at Respect Climate, which acted as a foundation to our interviews with four of their business customers. Further, we chose to collect communication data from their customers’ annual reports and websites in order to get a third dimension to our study.

Here we characterize the GW signals produced by spin-flip oscillations inside the fast-rotating protoneutron star in the SN core. In this novel mechanism, the release of both the oscillation-produced νμ's, ντ's and the spin-flip-driven GW pulse provides a unique <b>emission</b> <b>offset</b> $Δ T GW← ν = 0 $ for measuring the ν travel time to Earth.
