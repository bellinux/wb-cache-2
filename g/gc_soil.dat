40|$|Presentation of {{empirical}} equations for estimating engineering properties of soils is a simple, low cost and widely-used method. One {{of the major}} concerns in using these equations is evaluating their accuracy in different conditions and regions which often lead to doubts about obtained re-sults. Most of these equations were derived in special laboratories, different climate conditions and in soils with different geotechnical and geological engineering properties and were genera-lized to other conditions. The main question is that whether these methods are also applicable to other conditions. Using local equations and narrowing the usage range of various methods based on each region’s properties are appropriate methods to solve these problem. This leads to simpli-fied and faster analysis and high reliability in the obtained results. In this paper, empirical equa-tions were derived to estimate internal friction angle, based on SPT numbers of Mashhad City’s soils in Iran, using SPT and direct shear tests results from 50 samples (25 GW and 25 <b>GC</b> <b>soil</b> sam-ples). The results showed similar values for predicted φ values by SPT test and φ values deter-mined by direct shear tests...|$|E

Soil water samples were collected using porous cup suction lysimeters placed at various levels {{inside and outside the}} experimental trenches. Samples were analyzed for tracers using HPLC and <b>GC</b> methods. <b>Soil</b> moisture was generally low at both sites.

40|$|Information on aquifer {{thickness}} {{is one of}} the crucial inputs to numerical groundwater flow models, especially in the coastal areas that are threatened by increasing salt water intrusion leading to declining fresh groundwater resources. Since {{aquifer thickness}} data is missing {{in many parts of the}} world we designed a methodology to estimate it on global scale using state of the art datasets. We estimated the aquifer thickness by combining global topographical (Weatherhall et al., 2015, doi: 10. 1002 / 2015 EA 000107), lithological (Hartmann et. al, 2012, doi: 10. 1029 / 2012 <b>GC</b> 004370), <b>soil</b> thickness (Pelletier et al., 2016, doi: 10. 1002 / 2015 MS 000526) and sediment thickness from the global PCR-GLOBWB model (de Graaf et. al, 2015, doi: 10. 5194 /hess- 19 - 823 - 2015) to find the position and slope of the bedrock formation that are overlaid by unconsolidated sediments forming the aquifer system. The dataset includes the estimates of aquifer thickness at the coastline for each cross-section together with corresponding "anchor points" (last point with known thickness from Pelletier et. al, 2016). With this information it is possible to create 2 D cross-sectional groundwater flow coupled with salt transport models to estimate the fresh groundwater resources in coastal areas. More attention should be paid to the composition of unconsolidated sediment aquifers in terms of low permeable layers that can play a large role in the distribution of fresh and saline groundwater...|$|R

The model estimated annual mean NPP of the biomes in China to be between 0 and 1270. 7 gC m- 2 yr- 1 at present. The highest productivity was found in tropical seasonal and rain forests while temperate forests had an intermediate NPP, which is higher than a lower NPP of temperate savannas, grasslands and steppes. The lowest NPP occurred in desert, alpine tundra and ice/polar desert in cold or arid regions, especially on the Tibetan Plateau. The lowest monthly NPP of each biome occurred generally in February and the highest monthly NPP occurred during the summer (June to August). The annual mean NPP and LAI of most of biomes at changed climate with CO 2 at 340 and 500 ppmv (direct effects on physiology) would be greater than present. The direct effects of carbon dioxide on plant physiology result in significant increase of LAI and NPP. The carbon storage of Chinese biomes at present and changed climates was calculated by the carbon density and vegetation area method. The present estimates of carbon storage are totally 175. 83 × 1012 gC (57. 57 × 1012 gC in vegetation and 118. 28 × 1012 <b>gC</b> in <b>soils).</b> Changed climate without and with the CO 2 direct physiological effects will result in an increase of carbon storage of 5. 1 and 16. 33 × 1012, gC compared to present, respectively.

40|$|Evapotranspiration (ET), {{which is}} {{comprised}} by evaporation from soil surface (E), transpiration (T) and evaporation from the intercepted water by canopy (EI), {{plays an important}} role in maintaining global energy balance and regulating climate. Quantifying the spatiotemporal variations of T/ET (the ratio of T to ET) can improve our understandings on the role of vegetation ecophysiological processes in climate regulation. Using eddy covariance measurements at three forest ecosystems (Changbaishan temperate broad-leaved Korean pine mixed forest (CBS), Qianyanzhou subtropical coniferous plantation (QYZ) and Dinghushan subtropical evergreen mixed forest (DHS)) in north-south transect of Eastern China (NSTEC), we run the revised Shuttleworth-Wallace model (S-W model), validated its performance with the water vapor fluxes measured at two layers, and quantified the spatiotemporal variations of T/ET. The S-W model performed well in simulating ET and T/ET. The mean value of annual T/ET at three forests during the observation period all exceeded 0. 6. The diurnal variation of canopy stomal conductance (G(c)) dominated that of TAT. The seasonal dynamics of T/ El was mainly shaped by that of leaf area index (LAI), vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and air temperature (T-a) through altering G, and the portion that the energy absorbed by canopy (P-EC) at temperate forest (CBS), while the seasonal dynamics of T/ET at subtropical forests (QYZ and DHS) were mainly affected by T-a, net radiation, VPD, and soil water content through altering <b>G(c)</b> and <b>soil</b> surface conductance (G(s)). The variation of mean annual G(c) governed the interannual varaition and spatial variation of T/ET. Therefore, forests in Eastern China played an important role in regulating climate through T and G(c) primarily affected the spatial and temproal variations of the role of forest Tin regulating climate.

40|$|The role of seepage {{undercutting}} on mass {{failure of}} stream banks {{is not well}} defined relative to other streambank failure mechanisms. Seepage flow initiates undercutting, similar to development and headward migration of internal gullies, by liquefaction of soil particles, followed by mass wasting of the stream bank. The objectives of this research were to quantify the impact of seepage undercutting on streambank stability based upon seepage flow and erosion measurements from two deeply incised streams in northern Mississippi: Little Topashaw Creek (LTC) and Goodwin Creek (<b>GC).</b> Stream bank <b>soil</b> properties characterized from disturbed and undisturbed soil cores suggested {{that the type of}} seepage erosion (seepage erosion of a conductive layer and undercutting of layers underneath the seepage layer) at LTC and GC was a function of the bank stratigraphy. At LTC, seepage eroded sediment from the conductive, relatively noncohesive loamy sand layer. The GC seeps originated from the conductive concretion layer, but the flow eroded a less cohesive loamy sand layer below the seepage layer.

A procedure {{was developed for}} the analysis in field soils of iodosulfuron-methyl 1 and of its metabolites iodosulfonamide 2 and iodosaccharin 3 with a sensitivity limit of 0. 3 μg of equivalents of iodosulfuron-methyl 1 kg - 1 dry <b>soil.</b> <b>GC</b> and GC-MS was used after purification of the soil extracts by repeated TLC, and methylation. The results of the chemical analyses were confirmed by means of bioassays using sugar beet as test plants. On a winter wheat crop grown on sandy loam soil of pH 6. 2 at Melle, iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium 1 was applied {{at the beginning of}} April. The iodosulfuron-methyl 1 soil half-life in the 0 - 10 cm surface soil layer was 60 days. At the end of June, the sum of the concentrations of the metabolites 2 and 3 in the 0 - 10 cm surface soil layer attained a maximum corresponding to 27 % of the applied dose. Green manures were sown after the harvest of the wheat at the end of August. No phytotoxicity at all was observed during the growth of the green manures, in spite of the very low residues of iodosulfuron-methyl 1 remaining in soil in September and October. At the mid of November, iodosulfuron-methyl 1 and its metabolites 2 and 3 were no more detected in soil. On three other winter wheat crops grown on clay soils of pH of about 8 at Leke, Gistel and Zevekote, iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium 1 was applied at the beginning of May. The soil half-life of iodosulfuron-methyl 1 in the 0 - 10 cm surface soil layer was between 30 and 44 days. Since the application and until the mid of November, in all the trials made on sandy loam or clay soils, iodosulfuron-methyl 1 (and its metabolites 2 and 3 in the trial made on sandy loam soil) were never detected in the 10 - 15 and 15 - 20 cm surface soil layers, indicating their low mobilities in the field soils.

40|$|Bacterial populations (CFU) {{have been}} shown to {{oscillate}} in wavelike patterns after nutrient impulses in previous studies. The amplitudes and periods of oscillations could possibly be used as indicators of soil health analogous to the stability and resilience of biological populations widely accepted as indicators for ecosystem health. Limited plant and animal disease outbreaks can also be viewed as a manifestation of a healthy soil ecosystem. Two pot experiments were carried out to verify whether damping-off of beet seedlings by Pythium ultimum, measured as area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC), fluctuated over time after incorporation of organic materials into organic versus conventional soils, and to investigate whether daily dynamics of AUDPCs were linked to the dynamics of microbial populations and chemical parameters. AUDPCs oscillated significantly over time when Pythium bioassays were initiated daily after addition of ground grass and clover shoots (<b>GC)</b> into unplanted <b>soils.</b> Similar oscillations with significant harmonics of AUDPC were also observed in composted manure (CM) -amended soils but with smaller amplitudes than in GC-amended soils. The AUDPC harmonics in amended soils had periods similar to those of CFU of copiotrophic bacteria. Cross-correlation analysis demonstrated that periodic fluctuations of P. ultimum infections (AUDPCs) did not coincide with those of copiotrophic CFU but were shifted in phase. It appears that competition or antagonism from some fast-growing bacteria influenced pathogen infections, because these bacterial populations were growing and dying. Soil chemical variables, including pH, dissolved organic carbon, and NO(3) (-) -N, and NH(4) (+) -N contents, changed significantly in the initial 7 days after a nutrient impulse into soils. These changes were cross-correlated with copiotrophic CFU with time lags of approximately 1 to 2 days but were seldom associated with daily changes in AUDPCs. Organically managed soils always had lower AUDPC ratios of amended to nonamended treatments, indicating that organic materials showed stronger suppressive abilities to P. ultimum in organic than in conventional soils. The oscillations in AUDPCs and copiotrophic CFU in amended organic soil also had smaller amplitudes than in amended conventional soil. These results suggested that organically managed soils had a greater resistance and resilience to the disturbance of the amendments and, therefore, could be considered healthier than conventionally managed soil...|$|R
40|$|Groundcover {{management}} systems (GMSs) are essential in fruit production {{to achieve and}} sustain orchard productivity over long-term production cycles. The present dissertation compiles four studies evaluating the effects of GMSs on the long-term performance and nutrient dynamics of an apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.) orchard, and on tree growth and production, erosion rates, and root system development of a hillside avocado (Persea americana Mill.) orchard. Four GMSs-pre-emergence herbicides, post-emergence herbicide, a sod cover crop, and bark mulch-were evaluated in the apple orchard. Over 16 years were no consistent long-term trends in fruit yields among GMSs, and long-term responses of trees to groundcover vegetation indicated that trees respond adaptively to compensate for surface vegetation competition. Two Nitrogen (N) budgets were developed for each GMS based on N inputs, internal cycling, and outputs, with and without applied N fertilizer. More than 60 % of internal N fluxes were comprised of soil mineralization and recycling groundcover biomass; and harvested fruit represented 70 % of N outputs from the system during both years. During the year with N fertilizer, N losses approached 4 and 22 % through surface runoff and subsurface leaching, respectively. During the year without N fertilizer, the surface runoff N losses were twice the subsurface leaching N losses in all GMSs. We evaluated three GMSs in a steep hillside avocado orchard in Chile-Bare soil (BS), a vegetation strip (VS), and a groundcover (GC) covering the entire surface of the plots. Three years after tree establishment, trees in the BS plots were significantly bigger and produced more fruit than trees in the VS and <b>GC</b> treatments, but <b>soil</b> physical properties had deteriorated in the BS {{compared to the other}} treatments. Runoff volumes, soil erosion, and nutrient losses were consistently higher in the BS than VS and CG treatments. Trees in BS plots had more shallow and thicker roots than in VS and GC. Lifespans of roots in the BS and VS plots were 61 % and 47 % greater than in the GC plots, respectively. More root production was observed in the non-bearing year than in the bearing year, in all the GMS treatments...|$|R
40|$|In March 2006, four groundcover {{management}} systems (GMS) and two nutrient sources (NS) were implemented {{for their ability}} to alter the soil physical condition of a newly established, organically managed apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.) orchard. Annual applications of municipal green compost (GC), shredded office paper (SP), wood chips (WC), and mow-blow (MB) grass mulch were utilized as GMS, and NS supplied to trees were from composted poultry litter (PL), a commercial organic fertilizer (CF), or an untreated control (NF) in a 4 x 3 factorial study. An established, conventionally-managed orchard was located adjacent to the organic research orchard on the same silt loam soil. Physical soil characteristics were measured from the conventional orchard providing a qualitative comparison of orchard {{management systems}}. Soil organic matter (SOM) concentration averaged 1. 5 % from 0 - 10 cm depth across all treatments at orchard establishment (2006). By 2012, SOM increased to 5. 6 % in GC, and SOM in MB, SP, and WC increased to 2. 6 %, 3. 0 %, and 3. 2 %, respectively. Commercial organic fertilizer and NF treatments with GC resulted in greatest SOM increases. The change in SOM impacted physical soil characteristics. Mow-blow treatments provided the least measured change in soil quality and served as a comparator to other GMS not measured in 2006. Significant increases in estimated plant available water, water stable aggregate formation, water infiltration rate, and saturated hydraulic conductivity were observed in GC. No differences were found in bulk density (BD) in 2006 from 0 - 6 cm, but BD decreased in following years for all GMS. All GMS treatments increased TC and TN concentrations from 2006 to 2011 in the top 7. 5 cm soil layer, most significantly in GC. The greatest increases in TC and TN contents from 2006 were also observed in the GC treatments. Compared to the conventional orchard, <b>GC</b> most improved <b>soil</b> quality.

40|$|Estimates of soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) {{sequestration}} or loss can be biased by large uncertainties deriving from {{temporal and spatial}} variability of organic carbon concentrations, even at the field level. In order to reduce these uncertainties, we used the organic carbon associated with clay and fine silt particles (stable carbon, slow pool) as an indicator for carbon changes rather than SOC in bulk soil for assessing decadal changes. We used an on-going long-term experiment in the Hesbay region in Belgium, started in 1959, with 3 contrasting management practices (3 x 6 replicates) : Residue Export (RE), Farmyard manure application (FYM) and Residue Restitution (RR). After 42 years, there are {{no significant differences in}} bulk soil organic carbon concentrations between treatments (RE= 9. 2 gC. kg- 1 soil; FYM= 10. 4 gC. kg- 1 soil; RR= 10. 1 <b>gC.</b> kg- 1 <b>soil).</b> In contrast, there are significant differences (p< 0. 05) in stable carbon between treatments over the same time period. Moreover, we can be 99 % confident that stable carbon increased between 1970 and 2012 in FYM (+ 19 %) and RR plots (+ 14 %). There was no significant change of stable carbon in RE plots over the same period. In 1970, no differences in stable carbon concentration were detected between management practices. Labile carbon (carbon non-associated with clay and fine silt particles) did not change significantly from 1970 to 2012 but its variability increased for plots under management. We used the Rothamsted Carbon model (RothC- 26. 3) to explain how sensitive and slow pools react under different management practices. For bulk soil, observed trends in SOC stocks are in line with the ones predicted. Modelled SOC stocks changes from 1962 to 2012 are - 14 % (RE) and + 10 % (FYM). We also used RothC- 26. 3 to understand the evolution of the sensitive and slow fractions over time. We found that RothC was not capable to simulate the interannual variability of observed SOC stocks. On the other hand, slow RothC pools are useful to understand SOC stocks evolution over decades between two specific periods. In FYM and RR plots, both the RothC pool with slow decomposition (HUM) and the carbon associated with the fine fraction increase. This highlights that residue managements can improve carbon sequestration in agricultural soils, even if no changes are detected in bulk soil...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the role}} of soils in the global carbon cycle, there is {{increasing}} demand for data on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, but the conventional determination of SOC stock (SSOC) is tedious and hardly allows meeting this demand. Visible and near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (VNIRS) is a time- and cost-effective approach that has been successfully used for characterizing SOC concentration, even in the field. The present study aimed at testing the potential of VNIRS for characterizing SSOC in the field, from spectra acquired on partially disturbed cores collected using a manual auger (thus not using cylinder sampling except for calibration), at 0 – 10, 10 – 20 and 20 – 30 cm depth in two agroforestry fields in France. Both fields were on silty Luvisols under temperate climate and included tree rows with grass cover, plowed interrows with cereals, and a conventional agricultural plot without trees. Conventional determination of SSOC involved bulk density measurement (cylinder method) and SOC concentration analysis (dry combustion) on the same samples, and was calculated as their product. VNIR spectra were acquired using an ASD LabSpec 2500 spectrophotometer, on the outer side of cores collected using a manual auger, at three points around the place where SSOC was determined. In total, 288 samples were studied (144 per field). Calibration with partial least squares regression was carried out on the 200 most spectrally representative samples, and validation was performed on the remaining samples. Considering the determination coefficient for validation (R 2 val), standard error of prediction corrected for bias (SEPc) and ratio of standard deviation of the validation subset to SEPc (denoted RPDval), the VNIRS prediction of SOC concentration was accurate (R 2 val = 0. 75; SEPc = 1. 6 <b>gC</b> kg− 1 <b>soil</b> < 2 mm, i. e. 13 % of the mean; RPDval = 2. 0). The prediction of SSOC was acceptable (R 2 val = 0. 70; SEPc = 2. 0 gC dm− 3, representing 13 % of the mean; RPDval = 1. 8). Part of the VNIRS prediction error could be attributed to the fact that conventional and spectral measurements were not made on the same samples. Scanning the cylinder cores would probably result in better VNIRS predictions but is not consistent with the objective of determining SSOC without tedious cylinder sampling (except for calibration). However, conventional determination of SOC concentration on auger cores (rather than on cylinder cores) could be a valuable solution for improving calibration, with the perspective to develop a rapid procedure for accurate VNIRS prediction of SOC stock in the field.

40|$|Soil pollution, {{particularly}} by petroleum compounds {{is a very}} important global issue. It is typically a result of improper storage and disposal, historic careless spills, accidental spills, and leaks from tanks. This environmental damage can result in wide spread groundwater and surface water contamination, and limit soil use for agricultural purposes. There are a large number of brownfield sites across Canada. These are sites that have been previously used for industrial and commercial activities and have been contaminated with hazardous wastes. Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) in particular, has numerous sites due to a legacy of fuel oil use for power generation at abandoned, old and emerging mining fields. Data from the federal contaminated site inventory indicate that on federal owned sites in NL, there are over 3000 m³ of oil-contaminated soil. It has therefore become necessary to develop remediation technologies that are economically and technically feasible, environmentally friendly, fast, and applicable {{in a wide range of}} physical settings. A wide range of technologies have been developed over the past few decades for the remediation of contaminated sites. Some of these processes have been found to be successful in removing only a specific group of contaminants from the soil. As a result, combinations of different approaches are usually adopted for more effective remediation thereby leading to more expensive remedial operations. Surfactant-enhanced remediation technology, otherwise known as soil washing has proven to be an effective method to remove a mixture of contaminants such as heavy metals, petroleum compounds, volatile organic compounds, pesticides and herbicides as well as other hazardous and non-degradable substances from contaminated soils. Surfactant remediation relies on the ability of surfactant formulations to remove both organic and inorganic contaminants from soil and sediments by desorbing them from the solid to liquid phase. The technology removes contaminants via two mechanisms; one occurs below the Critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the surfactants known as mobilization mechanism, and the other above the CMC known as solubilization mechanism. However, this technology has not been widely reported for the remediation of Bunker C fuel oil, a complex and recalcitrant petroleum compound that is persistent in the environment and extensively reported to be resistant to chemical and biological degradation, and therefore difficult to remediate. This research presents an assessment of the performance of soil washing technology for the remediation of Bunker C contaminated oil from weathered contaminated soil using patented surfactant formulations. Weathered soil are known to be more difficult to remediate than freshly contaminated soil hence, the study used weathered soil in order to be certain of the effects of soil washing on Bunker C removal. Specific research objectives include: (1) determining the micellar properties (Surface Tension and CMC) of the patented surfactants, (2) development of a reliable analytical method for the analysis of (heavy) petroleum hydrocarbons in soil, (3) evaluation of the parameters that govern the implementation of soil washing and an assessment of their effects on the washing of weathered Bunker C oil from contaminated soil at surfactants concentrations below the CMC (mobilization mechanism) using the multivariate experimental and statistical approach, (4) determination of the optimum conditions (optimization) for the removal of Bunker C oil with the tested surfactants. The research, in the course of analysing the Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon in the soil using the Canada-Wide Standard (CWS) for Petroleum Hydrocarbon in soil is used for the analysis of petroleum hydrocarbon compounds found considerable variability and inconsistencies in the results. This could be due, in part, to the different gas chromatography (<b>GC)</b> conditions, <b>soil</b> properties, as well as and other steps involved in the method. These differences impacts the determination of the effectiveness of remediation at hydrocarbon-contaminated sites. The thesis therefore, developed validated the analytical method for the quantitative analysis of TPH in (contaminated) soil. The newly developed method was successfully applied for a faster and more reliable analysis of TPH of Bunker C oil in contaminated soil. It is expected that this research will lay a road map for further studies on the application, optimization and development of a treatment system protocol for the use of soil washing for Bunker C remediation. It should be noted that although Bunker C is the contaminant, the hydrocarbon composition of Bunker C makes it a good surrogate for other heavy oils...|$|R
40|$|The global forest {{ecosystems}} {{play an important}} role in the global carbon cycle and in the preservation of biological diversity. The dissertation presents a qualitative analysis of non-sustainable civilisation-nature interaction patterns relevant for global deforestation and forest degradation. Since this problem is closely linked to other core problems of Global Change (<b>GC),</b> e. g. <b>Soil</b> Degradation, World Food security, Climate Change, etc., it is not to be tackled separately. Therefore a novel transdisciplinary approach to analyse non-sustainable civilisation nature interactions in the context of GC is utilised in the investigation. The approach rests on the decomposition of the intricate dynamics of GC into patterns of problematic civilisation nature interactions ("Syndromes") by an iterative process of observations, data and system theoretical analysis, and GIS based modelling attempts. These Syndromes characterise endangering and risky developments of civilisation nature interaction and represent a baseline for measuring and indicating 'non-sustainability' - in order to have a sustainable development it is necessary to have a far-reaching absence of Syndromes. The patterns are defined as characteristic constellations of interacting socio-economic and physical phenomena ("Symptomes" of GC), which build complex dynamical systems of civilisation-nature interaction. The cause-effect schemes of Symptomes and their interrelations are constituted as complex phenomena resulting from interactions over the different spheres of the Earth System. The approach is illustrated by a detailed analysis of those civilisation nature interaction patterns relevant for global deforestation. Human activities cause a wide extent of deforestation and threaten the important role of the remaining global forest within the earth system. Global deforestation and forest degradation is made up by a limited number of cause effect patterns observed in different parts of the world. The main syndromes identified causing large scale deforestation are: The overexploitation of natural ecosystems - the OVEREXPLOITATION SYNDROME. Examples of this pattern are the exploitation of forests for timber or fuelwood and charcoal. The rural poverty driven overuse of natural resources - the SAHEL SYNDROME. Examples are the exploitation of forests via slash and burn cultivation by smallholders, particular in tropical developing countries. Non-sustainable agro-industrial use of soils and bodies of water - the DUST BOWL SYNDROME. Examples are the conversion of forest for large cattle farming or cash crop agriculture. Besides these mayor cause-effect schemes of global deforestation, there are several other Syndromes that contribute on a minor scale, e. g. the development and destruction of nature for recreational ends (MASS TOURISM SYNDROME), the environmental damage of natural landscapes as a result of large-scale projects like dams (ARAL SEA SYNDROME), the environmental degradation related to mining and extraction of non-renewable resources (KATANGA SYNDROME) or the environmental degradation through large-scale diffusion of long-lived substances (SMOKESTACK SYNDROME) as in the case of acid rain. The geographical analysis of a Syndrome is performed in several steps integrating GIS with concepts of fuzzy logic and qualitative reasoning. In the first step a syndrome specific network of interactions is formulated by analysing case studies, theories and expert assessments. Based on this systemic representation the natural and socio-economic conditions under which the syndrome specific mechanisms can be active are identified. This evaluation is called the disposition of a region towards a specific Syndrome. The resulting indicator can be used as an early warning indicator for the possible germination of a non-sustainable development. Based on the constituting elements of the Syndrome, a complex indicator for the intensity of the active Syndrome is derived in the next step of the analysis. This indicator assesses the critical states in the dynamical evolution of the non-sustainable patterns of civilisation nature interaction. Complete Syndrome analyses are performed for the main Syndromes of deforestation. The resulting spatial distribution of the combined dispositions and intensities of the different Syndromes present a unique global assessment describing the current damage and future regional threats to forests by their underlying global cause-effect patterns of civilisation-nature interaction. Specially the assessment of the threat by coupling of momentarily active and potentially active cause-effect patterns provides a previously not achieved systematic insight into the complex interaction of different patterns of global deforestation and forest degradation. </P...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{anthropogenic}} {{climate change}} {{is one of the}} greatest challenges that human civilisation will face in the 21 st century. A 25 - 180 % increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide content since the early 1800 ’s and a predicted increase of 2 - 3 % each year will lead to a 2 - 6 °C rise in tropospheric temperatures. The consequences of increased atmospheric temperatures are profound and would put unsustainable strain on human infrastructure, which was conservatively estimated in the Stern Review (2006) to cost approximately 20 % of GDP. Given the political, technical, economic and social barriers preventing the transition to a low carbon economy, there is an unequivocal need to research ‘geoengineering’ technologies that can bridge the gap between carbon emission reduction targets and actual emissions. Soil mineral carbonation is one such technology. The atmosphere is one of the smallest carbon pools at the Earth’s Surface (depending on how each pool is demarcated). Soils turn over the quantity of carbon in the atmosphere in under a decade and collectively form one of the largest carbon pools (3 - 4 times the quantity of carbon in the atmosphere). Land use change since the agricultural revolution has released 256 GtC (40 % of anthropogenic emissions). Research investigating the potential for carbon accumulation in soils is primarily focused on restoring organic carbon concentration to pre-agricultural values through modification of farming practices. The research presented in this thesis is the first that explores the potential of increasing the inorganic carbon pool as an emissions mitigation technology. Inorganic carbon accumulation is promoted by introducing divalent cation rich (predominantly calcium and magnesium) silicate and hydroxide minerals into the soil, which weather and supersaturate the soil solution with respect to carbonate minerals (predominantly calcite, aragonite, magnesite and dolomite). The carbon in the resultant precipitate is derived from the atmosphere. This is analogous to mineral carbonation technologies which induce carbonate precipitation from silicate weathering in industrial scale reactors at elevated temperatures and pressures. However, carbonation in soil exploits natural weathering processes to the same effect with minimal energy and infrastructure input. The research presented in this thesis broadly investigates soil mineral carbonation by contributing work towards the fundamental issues associated with application of soil mineral carbonation technology. Research activity described herein covers a range of laboratory batch weathering experiments, field work, geochemical modelling, plant growth trials, soil microcosm experiments and literature reviews. While eclectic, all work packages contribute to the same goal of describing the efficacy, effectiveness and potential impacts of soil mineral carbonation. The efficacy of mineral carbonation technology is primarily limited by the availability of appropriate silicate bearing material. A literature search suggests that approximately 15 - 16 Gt a- 1 of silicate rich ‘waste’ materials are produced as a consequence of human activity. This has a carbon capture potential between 190 and 332 MtC a- 1, which is equivalent to other emissions mitigation strategies. Quarrying silicate specifically for carbonation is a suggested strategy that may be able to store on the order of 102 GtC a- 1 (based on two sites in the US). Therefore, mineral carbonation may form part of global mitigation strategies collectively equivalent to 14 GtC a- 1 to stabilise the CO 2 concentration of the atmosphere at 500 parts per million by volume. Considering that the potential capacity of soil mineral carbonation is sufficient to act as a substantial emissions mitigation strategy it was appropriate to investigate issues associated with the application of such a technology. In the first instance, sites known to contain silicates were investigated. These include soils developed on natural silicates (on the Whin Sill in Northumberland), construction and demolition waste (at a brownfield site and waste transfer stations) and slag (at a former steelworks). Interpretation of fieldwork results suggests that inorganic carbon accumulation is rapid (up to 38 <b>gC</b> kg- 1 (<b>soil)</b> a- 1), and is orders of magnitude xxv greater than organic carbon accumulation in natural soils. The average concentration of inorganic carbon (20 - 30 Kg m- 3) is equivalent to organic carbon in natural soils. The unusually light carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of the carbonate (- 3. 1 ‰ and - 27. 5 ‰ for δ 13 C and - 3. 9 ‰ and - 20. 9 ‰ for δ 18 O) were used to determine that up to 55 % of the carbon was derived from the atmosphere. The rate of carbon capture, which is the same as the precipitation rate of carbonate, is a function of solution chemistry. The more supersaturated a solution is with respect to a carbonate mineral, the more rapid the precipitation rate. Saturation of a solution is a function of divalent cation and carbonate anion concentration. Therefore, the supply of each of these components was investigated in laboratory experiments. Batch weathering experiments were used to investigate the supply of calcium from artificial silicates (hydrated cement gel). Up to 70 - 80 % of the calcium contained in the mineral was removed, which is consistent with efficiencies reported for conventional mineral carbonation. The log rate of weathering was between - 10. 66 and - 6. 86 mol Ca cm- 2 sec- 1, which is several orders of magnitude greater than that usually reported for natural silicates. Microcosm experiments were conducted to investigate the rate of supply of carbonate from the organic carbon mineralisation in high pH solutions. The research clearly demonstrates that high pH solutions inhibit the breakdown of organic carbon as a function of nutrient supply. Where organic carbon was successfully mineralised the log rates (- 3. 4 mmol g- 1 (field moist soil) sec- 1) were equivalent to that found in previous studies. While the influx of dissolved carbonate mineral components into the soil solution is the primary controlling step in the rate of carbon accumulation, there is a complex relationship between soil physical properties and geochemistry. This was highlighted in a numerical model that was constructed for this thesis, which suggests that soil pore volume and particle size distribution are important variables. An additional numerical model was constructed to investigate the transportation of silicate material to the application site. This model suggests that an economics of soil mineral carbonation is a function of transport costs, the value of the silicate material and the price of carbon. Field observations, growth trials, microcosm experiments and previous research suggest a complex interaction between biology, weathering and carbonate precipitation. Additional work is required to investigate carbonate precipitation mediated by plant and microorganism activity and the degree to which soil mixed with silicates impact on ecosystem functioning. This research has demonstrated that mineral carbonation in soils could form a substantial emissions mitigation strategy, but additional work is required in a number of areas to which this thesis provides a suitable foundation.
