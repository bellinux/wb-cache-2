5|$|Ants {{attack and}} defend {{themselves}} by biting and, in many species, by stinging, often injecting or spraying chemicals, such as formic acid {{in the case}} of formicine ants, alkaloids and piperidines in <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> and a variety of protein components in other ants. Bullet ants (Paraponera), located in Central and South America, are considered to have the most painful sting of any insect, although it is usually not fatal to humans. This sting is given the highest rating on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index.|$|E
25|$|Interactions between red {{imported}} <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> {{and mammals}} have been rarely documented. However, deaths of live-trapped animals by red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> have been observed. Mortality rates in eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) young range from 33 to 75% because of red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> It {{is believed that}} red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> have a strong impact on many herpetofauna species; scientists have noted population declines in the Florida kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula floridana), and eggs and adults of the eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus) and six-lined racerunner (Aspidoscelis sexlineata) {{are a source of}} food. Because of this, eastern fence lizards have adapted to have longer legs and new behaviours to escape the red imported fire ant. Adult three-toed box turtles (Terrapene carolina triunguis), Houston toad (Anaxyrus houstonensis) juveniles, and American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) hatchlings are also attacked and killed by these ants. Despite this mostly-negative association, one study shows that red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> may be capable of impacting vector-borne disease transmissions by regulating tick populations and altering vector and host dynamics, thereby reducing transmission rates not only to animals, but to humans as well.|$|E
25|$|Mortality {{rates have}} been well {{observed}} in birds; there have been instances where no young have survived to adulthood in areas with high fire ant density. Many birds including cliff nesting swallows, ducks, egrets, quail, and terns {{have been affected by}} red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> Ground nesting birds, particularly the least tern (Sterna antillarum), are vulnerable to fire ant attacks. The impact of red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> on colonial breeding birds is especially severe; waterbirds can experience a mortality rate of 100%, although this factor was lower for early-nesting birds. Brood survival decreases in American cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) if they are exposed to foraging workers. Songbird nest survival decreases in areas with red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> present, but survival rates in white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus) and black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla) nests increase from 10% to 31% and 7% to 13% whenever <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> are not present or when they are unable to attack them. Red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> may indirectly contribute to low brood survival in the Attwater's prairie chicken. It was first thought that the ants were linked to the decline of overwintering birds such as the loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), but a later study showed that ant eradication efforts using the pesticide Mirex, which was known to have toxic side effects, was largely to blame.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> (Solenopsis xyloni), {{also known}} as the Californian <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> or cotton ant, is a stinging <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> native to southern parts of the United States.

It has a broad and opportunistic diet, and will store seeds in its nest and eat honeydew collected from other insects.|$|R

25|$|Owing to its notoriety and {{invasive}} behaviour, red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> {{are considered}} to be pests. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration estimates more than $5 billion is spent annually on medical treatment, damage, and control in infested areas. They can also cause $2.5 billion in damages annually in just 20 years. In Texas alone, red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> caused $300 million in damages for livestock, wildlife and public health. Approximately $36 per American household, and more than $250 million has been spent to control and eradicate red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> Private agencies spend $25 to $40 million on pesticides annually. Unsuccessful eradication in Australia may cost the economy billions in damages annually and, based on a Queensland government study, the estimated cost could reach $43 billion over 30 years.|$|E
25|$|Red {{imported}} <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> {{have negative}} impacts on seed germination. The {{extent of the}} damage, however, depends on how long seeds are vulnerable for (dry and germinating) and by the abundance of the ants. One study showed that while these ants are attracted to and remove seeds which have adapted for ant dispersal, red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> damage these seeds or move them in unfavourable locations for germination. In seeds given to colonies, 80% of Sanguinaria canadensi seeds were scarified and 86% of Viola rotundifolia seeds were destroyed. Small percentages of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) seeds deposited by workers successfully germinate, thus providing evidence that red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> help the movement of seeds in the longleaf pine ecosystem. Elaiosome-bearing seeds are collected {{at a higher rate}} in contrast to nonelaiosome-bearing seeds and do not store them in their nests, but rather in surface trash piles in the mound vicinity.|$|E
25|$|Several baits {{have been}} used to control populations. Mounds are {{destroyed}} {{in a matter of weeks}} if baits are used on them. Baits are considered to be effective and simple to use against red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> in comparison to drenching, dusting, or fumigating. They are sprinkled onto the mound then the ants take and consume them. Certain baits such as growth regulator baits, and boric acid-sucrose water baits, benefit native fauna and low concentrations are usually required to kill a colony. Others baits used against red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> include Amdro, Ascend, hydramethylnon, and Maxforce.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Efforts are {{underway}} to introduce natural {{enemies of the}} red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> to lessen its competitiveness against native ants. Releases of fire-ant-decapitating phorid flies {{have been made in}} several southern states. Mass rearing and additional releases of these flies {{are underway}} now. Experimental releases of a disease-causing protozoan have been made in ten southern states. A number of least-toxic <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> control materials are discussed. Sources for some materials are provided in the Resources section. Physical controls such as hot water, steam, and ant traps are discussed. <b>Fire</b> <b>Ant</b> Ecology and Biological Controls The red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> Solenopsis invicta, arrived in the U. S. from central Brazil between 1933 and 1945 by hitchhiking on ship cargo. Though S. invicta has become quite a pest, not all <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> species have achieved pest status. The black imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> Solenopsis richteri, arrived before the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> sometime around 1918. S. invicta has out-competed its black cousins and also crossed with them, creating hybrids between the two species (1). The Texas red ant, S. geminata, a native American <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> found in much of Texas, is not considered a pest. The red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> prospers in open sunny areas such as cropland, pastures, and urban lawns. It is an insect of disturbed, low-diversity habitats. In its native South America, the ant evolved in frequently disturbed floodplain areas. Undisturbed areas, such as swamplands an...|$|R
40|$|The red {{imported}} <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> Solenopsis invicta Buren, {{is considered}} an oil-loving feeder, however, carbohydrates are essential ingredients in the diet of the <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> also. Comprehensive screening of mono-, di-, and tri-saccharides demonstrated that glucose, fructose, fucose, sucrose, maltose, turanose and raffinose were significant phagostimulants for <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> workers. It was also found that while D-glucose and L-fucose, the naturally occurring isomers, were active, the opposite diastereomers were not. Any structural modification of the glucose molecule resulted in loss of activity. None of the sugar alcohols evaluated were active. The <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> is an agricultural pest and the many reports of <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> damage to food crops {{may be linked to}} their need for dietary carbohydrates. A knowledge of carbohydrate phagostimulants may help to understand specificity of fire ant/plant interactions...|$|R
25|$|The red {{imported}} ant can be misidentified as the similar-looking S. richteri. The {{two species}} {{can be distinguished}} from each other through morphological examinations of the head, thorax, and postpetiole. In S. richteri, {{the sides of the}} head are broadly elliptical and the cordate shape seen in the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> is absent. The region of the occipital lobes that are situated nearby the midline and occipital excision appear more crease-like in S. richteri than it does in the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant.</b> The scapes of S. richteri are longer than they are in the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> and the pronotum has strong angulate shoulders. Such character is almost absent in the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant.</b> A shallow but sunken area is only known in the larger workers of S. richteri, which is located in the posterior region of the dorsum of the pronotum. This feature is completely absent in larger red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> workers. The red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant's</b> promesonotum is strongly convex, whereas this feature is weakly convex in S. richteri. Upon examination, the base of the propodeum is elongated and straight in S. richteri, while convex and shorter in the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant.</b> It also has a wide postpetiole with either straight or diverging sides. The postpetiole in S. richteri is narrower with converging sides. In S. richteri, the transverse impression on the posterodorsal portion of the postpetiole is strong, but weak or absent in the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant.</b> As well as that, S. richteri workers are 15% larger than red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> workers, are blackish-brown, and have a yellow stripe on the dorsal side of the gaster.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} insects, arachnids, and birds prey on these ants, {{especially}} when queens {{are trying to}} establish a new colony. Many species of dragonfly, including Anax junius, Pachydiplax longipennis, Somatochlora provocans, and Tramea carolina, capture the queens while they are in flight; 16 species of spiders, including the wolf spider Lycosa timuga and the southern black widow spider (Latrodectus mactans), actively kill red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> L. mactans captures all castes of the species (the workers, queens, and males) within its web. These ants constitute 75% of prey captured by the spider. Juvenile L. mactans spiders have also been seen capturing the ants. Other invertebrates that prey on red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> are earwigs (Labidura riparia) and tiger beetles (Cicindella punctulata). Birds that eat these ants include the chimney swift (Chaetura pelagica), the eastern kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus), and the eastern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus virginianus). The eastern bobwhite attacks these ants by digging out the mounds looking for young queens. Red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> have been found in stomach contents inside of armadillos.|$|E
25|$|Other {{limitations}} on boll weevil populations include extreme heat and drought. Its natural predators include <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> insects, spiders, birds, and a parasitic wasp, Catolaccus grandis. The insects sometimes emerge from diapause before cotton buds are available.|$|E
25|$|The triangulate cobweb spider {{is known}} to prey on many other types of arthropods, ants (including <b>fire</b> <b>ants),</b> other spiders, pillbugs, and ticks. It preys on several other spiders {{believed}} to be harmful to humans, including the hobo spider and the brown recluse.|$|E
50|$|How {{formic acid}} {{acts as an}} {{antidote}} against the much more toxic <b>fire</b> <b>ant's</b> venom is unknown. <b>Fire</b> <b>ant</b> venom {{is a mixture of}} toxic alkaloids and proteins that presumably enable the alkaloids to enter rival ants’ cells. Each alkaloid in the <b>fire</b> <b>ant’s</b> venom, including solenopsin, has a six-membered heterocyclic ring with fat-soluble side chains. The researchers who discovered the antidote property of formic acid in crazy ants speculate that the formic acid denatures the proteins in <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> venom. Another possibility is that the nitrogen on an alkaloid’s heterocyclic ring is protonated, rendering the ionic molecule less lipophilic, thus less likely to penetrate the tawny crazy ant’s cells.|$|R
5000|$|Because of its {{tropical}} climate and {{its proximity to}} Mexico and Central America, Louisiana is able to support many invasive species that cannot survive elsewhere in the U.S. One such example is the red <b>fire</b> <b>ant.</b> Native to South America, the red <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> has flourished in many southern U.S. states since its introduction in the 1930s. Superficially similar to most other <b>ants,</b> the <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> is a vicious predator, attacking birds, rodents, and larger mammals in swarms.|$|R
50|$|Brown {{also worked}} {{to halt the}} spread of the {{imported}} <b>fire</b> <b>ant.</b> He even famously put his hand into a <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> mound at the urging of a television reporter while news cameras rolled. However, his opponent in the 1982 Democratic primary election, the liberal journalist and commentator Jim Hightower, accused him of manufacturing the <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> crisis to win reelection. Hightower unseated Brown in a heavily Democratic year in Texas and nationally. Eight years later Hightower was himself unseated by future Governor Rick Perry.|$|R
25|$|Around 1980, red {{imported}} <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> began spreading {{throughout the}} West Indies, {{where they were}} first reported in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Between 1991 and 2001, the ant was recorded from Trinidad and Tobago, several areas in the Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands, Antigua, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Since then, red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> have been recorded on more islands and regions, with new populations discovered in: Anguilla, Saint Martin, Barbuda, Montserrat, Saint Kitts, Nevis, Aruba, and Jamaica. The ants recorded from Aruba and Jamaica have only been found on golf courses; these courses import sod from Florida, so such importation {{may be an important}} way for the ant to spread throughout the West Indies.|$|E
25|$|Despite its pest {{status and}} notoriety, the red {{imported}} fire ant can be beneficial. The ant {{is an effective}} insect predator, so it {{may serve as a}} biological agent against other pest species, especially in sugarcane fields. Pest insects the ant kills include: boll weevils (Anthonomus grandis) in cotton crops, sugarcane borers (Diatraea saccharalis) in sugarcane fields, horn flies (Haematobia irritans) in manure, velvetbean caterpillars (Anticarsia gemmatalis) in soybeans, and whiteflies that are found in greenhouses. A number of studies indicate that red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> do not interfere or attack insects of economic importance in cotton fields, which has resulted in many farmers in the southeastern regions of the United States viewing red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> as beneficial. However, some scientists have suggested that the beneficial status of the red imported fire ant is hard to predict when geography, plant size, season, soil moisture and the use of insecticides are not considered. These factors may lower the efficacy of red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> as pest control agents. Another factor is that workers are indiscriminate and kill beneficial insects such as predators that eat horn flies and other pests in pastures and predators of aphids and scale insects. They also reduce the efficacy of parasitic wasps against pest species by eating the larvae and pupae.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{occupational}} hazards {{for those in}} agriculture; farming is a particularly dangerous industry.

Farmers also work around heavy machinery which can kill or injure them.|$|E

50|$|Researchers {{from the}} Agricultural Research Service are taking {{advantage}} of protists as pathogens to control red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> (Solenopsis invicta) populations in Argentina. Spore-producing protists such as Kneallhazia solenopsae (recognized as a sister clade or the closest relative to the fungus kingdom now) can reduce red <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> populations by 53-100%. Researchers have also been able to infect phorid fly parasitoids of the ant with the protist without harming the flies. This turns the flies into a vector that can spreads the pathogenic protist between red <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> colonies.|$|R
25|$|As mentioned, red {{imported}} <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> and Argentine ants {{compete with}} each other. Mortality rates vary in different scenarios (i.e. mortality rates in colony confrontation {{is lower than}} those confronting {{each other in the}} field). Major workers can also withstand more injuries to their bodies, thus increasing the mortality rate of Argentine ants. For an Argentine ant colony to successfully wipe out a monogyne colony of 160,000 workers, the colony would need 396,800 workers. A colony that has reduced in size due to successful bait treatment are prone to predation by Argentine ants. The ants may {{play a vital role in}} removing weakened fire ant colonies, and they may also be important in slowing the spread of these <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> especially in heavily infested Argentine ant areas. Despite this, Argentine ant populations in the southeastern United States have declined following the introduction of the red imported fire ant.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only do they}} {{thrive in}} urban areas, red {{imported}} <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> can damage equipment and infrastructure and impact business, land, and property values. They are also attracted to electricity; electrically stimulated workers release venom alkaloids, alarm pheromones, and recruitment pheromones, which in return attracts more workers to the site. As a result, red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> can destroy electrical equipment. This is known as magnetism, where scientists have identified internal magnetic materials which {{may play a role}} in orientation behaviours. They are known to chew through electrical insulation which causes damage to electric motors, irrigation lines, pumps, signal boxes, transformers, telephone exchanges, and other equipment. Colonies aggregate near electrical fields and are capable of causing short circuits or interfering with switches and equipment such as air conditioners, computers, and water pumps. They are also known to infest airport landing areas and traffic lights.|$|E
25|$|In areas it is native to, the red {{important}} {{fire ant}} {{is still a}} dominant species and coexists with 28 ant species in gallery forest gaps and ten species in xerophytic forest grassland, winning most aggressive interactions with other ants. However, some ants can be co-dominant in areas where they coexist such as the Argentine ant, where they compete symmetrically. Workers regularly engage in food competition with other ants, and can suppress the exploitation of food resources from honeydew-producing hemipterans (specifically from Phenacoccus solenopsis) from native ants; however, red important <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> are unable to eliminate T. melanocephalum completely although they consume {{a higher proportion of}} food. Instead, the two ants may peacefully coexist and share the honeydew. When encountering neighboring <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> workers may take on death-feigning behaviours to avoid them with success. However, such behaviour is only seen in young workers, as older workers either flee or fight back when threatened.|$|E

40|$|Organisms vary at the {{individual}} and population level in many ecologically relevant traits. This study documents and quantifies colony-level variation in ecologically important behaviors of a widespread invasive social insect, demonstrates multitrophic ecological effects of this colony-level variation, and explores genetic factors that may affect and predict behavior at the colony-level. I quantified significant, persistent regional and colony-level variation in the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> (Solenopsis invicta) in behaviors such as extra-nest activity, exploration, and resource discovery speed and recruitment effort. Colony behavior correlated with both colony productivity and colony growth. Using single-lineage colonies, I estimated broad-sense heritability of between 0. 45 and 0. 5 for the observed colony behaviors. I created experimental microcosms comprised of <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> colonies, plants, and insect herbivores. Differences in <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> colony behavior linked to carbohydrate attraction directly impacted herbivore mortality and indirectly impacted plant damage. I quantified colony differences colony differences in {{the expression of the}} <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> foraging gene (sifor) as well as colony-level differences in behavior for <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> colonies collected from across a large area of Texas. Expression of sifor was more than three-fold higher in <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> foragers than in <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> workers in the interior of the nest, and colony-level differences in sifor expression of foragers and interior workers correlated with colony behavior. Higher sifor expression in foragers correlated with higher foraging activity, exploratory activity, and recruitment to nectar in <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> colonies. Finally, I explored the hypothesis that <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> foundress groups could maximize inclusive fitness benefits and alter cooperative and competitive behaviors in response to cues indicating higher relatedness of foundresses. I found that group and queen performance was significantly affected by group composition. Groups composed of foundresses that {{were less likely to be}} related produced no more workers than queens founding alone, while groups composed of foundresses from the same site produced the most workers of all group types. The conclusions of this study have widespread implications for many social insects and their ecological interactions. By further exploring these effects at the mechanistic, organismal, and ecological level we will improve our understanding of collective behavior, social evolution, and intraspecific variation...|$|R
