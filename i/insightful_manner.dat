50|$|Although the {{exposition}} of Hindu doctrines to European audiences {{had already been}} attempted in piecemeal fashion at that time by many orientalists, Guénon's Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines advanced its subject in a uniquely <b>insightful</b> <b>manner,</b> by referring to the concepts of metaphysics and Tradition in their most general sense, which Guénon precisely defined, along with the necessary distinctions and definitions of seemingly unambiguous terms such as religion, tradition, exoterism, esoterism and theology. Guénon explained that his purpose was not to describe all aspects of Hinduism, but to give the necessary intellectual foundation for a proper understanding of its spirit. The book also stands as a harsh condemnation of works presented by certain other European writers about Hinduism and Tradition in general; according to Guénon, such writers had lacked any profound understanding of their subject matter and of its implications. The book also contains a critical analysis of the political intrusions of the British Empire into the subject of Hinduism (and India itself) through Madame Blavatsky's Theosophism.|$|E

40|$|Nondimensional {{parameters}} and equations governing the buckling behavior of rectangular symmetrically laminated plates are presented {{that can be}} used to represent the buckling resistance, for plates made of all known structural materials, in a very general, <b>insightful,</b> and encompassing <b>manner.</b> In addition, these parameters can be used to assess the degree of plate orthotropy, to assess the importance of anisotropy that couples bending and twisting deformations, and to characterize quasi-isotropic laminates quantitatively. Bounds for these nondimensional parameters are also presented that are based on thermodynamics and practical laminate construction considerations. These bounds provides insight into potential gains in buckling resistance through laminate tailoring and composite-material development. As an illustration of this point, upper bounds on the buckling resistance of long rectangular orthotropic plates with simply supported or clamped edges and subjected to uniform axial compression, uniform shear, or pure inplane bending loads are presented. The results indicate that the maximum gain in buckling resistance for tailored orthotropic laminates, with respect to the corresponding isotropic plate, is in the range of 26 - 36 % for plates with simply supported edges, irrespective of the loading conditions. For the plates with clamped edges, the corresponding gains in buckling resistance are in the range of 9 - 12 % for plates subjected to compression or pure inplane bending loads and potentially up to 30 % for plates subjected to shear loads...|$|R
40|$|This work {{sets out}} to {{evaluate}} the potential benefits and pit-falls in using a priori information to help solve the Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) inverse problem. In chapter one the forward problem in MEG is introduced, together with a scheme that demonstrates how a priori information {{can be incorporated into}} the inverse problem. Chapter two contains a literature review of techniques currently used to solve the inverse problem. Emphasis is put on the kind of a priori information that is used by each of these techniques and the ease with which additional constraints can be applied. The formalism of the FOCUSS algorithm is shown to allow for the incorporation of a priori information in an <b>insightful</b> and straightforward <b>manner.</b> In chapter three it is described how anatomical constraints, {{in the form of a}} realistically shaped source space, can be extracted from a subject’s Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI). The use of such constraints relies on accurate co-registration of the MEG and MRI co-ordinate systems. Variations of the two main co-registration approaches, based on fiducial markers or on surface matching, are described and the accuracy and robustness of a surface matching algorithm is evaluated. Figures of merit introduced in chapter four are shown to given insight into the limitations of a typical measurement set-up and potential value of a priori information. It is shown in chapter five that constrained dipole fitting and FOCUSS outperform unconstrained dipole fitting when data with low SNR is used. However, the effect of errors in the constraints can reduce this advantage. Finally, it is demonstrated in chapter six that the results of different localisation techniques give corroborative evidence about the location and activation sequence of the human visual cortical areas underlying the first 125 ms of the visual magnetic evoked response recorded with a whole head neuromagnetometer...|$|R

40|$|Introduction and aim As {{the field}} of tissue {{engineering}} (TE) matures, {{there is a growing}} need for novel imaging techniques for the characterisation of engineered constructs (i. e. cells/tissue combined with scaffolds) in a more <b>insightful</b> and quantitative <b>manner.</b> In a proof of concept study, we showed that combining the high spatial and contrast resolution of nanofocus computed tomography (nanoCT) with two different contrast agents allowed the visualisation and quantification of the neo-tissue formed in the TE constructs. Although the contrast difference between the cell-matrix fraction of the construct and the background was increased, the image quality was still limited because of metal-related image artefacts thus hindering accurate quantification in the entire scaffold. Using a design of experiment (DoE) approach we subsequently optimised the quality of the obtained datasets allowing the determination of the optimum staining time, contrast agent concentration and matrix quantity combinations. Materials, Methods and Results TE constructs were produced using Ti 6 Al 4 V scaffolds, which were seeded with human periosteal derived cells. The constructs were subsequently cultured in a 3 D perfusion bioreactor system or in a static 3 D setup to allow cell proliferation and matrix deposition. Post production the TE constructs were stained with Hexabrix™ or Phosphotungstic acid (PTA) prior to scanning using a Phoenix NanoTom S (GE Measurement and Control Solutions). The proof of principle study showed that the contrast enhanced nanoCT enabled the visualisation and quantification of the neo-tissue. For the Hexabrix™ stained datasets a correlation between the volume and the weight of the neo-tissue could be determined indicating that this contrast agent enables the visualisation and quantification of the entire neo-tissue fraction in the TE constructs. The DoE study showed that the image quality of the Hexabrix™ stained constructs was significantly influenced by the concentration of the staining agent. For the most optimal concentration, the image artefacts no longer affected the quantification of the ECM content. For the PTA stained constructs, staining time and concentration as well as the cell-matrix quantity had a significant effect on the contrast. Although for the most optimal staining conditions the influence of the image artefacts on the quantification of the ECM content was reduced, it could not completely be excluded. Conclusion CE-nanoCT is a non-invasive imaging technique that allows 3 D visualization and quantification of in vitro engineered neo-tissue’s in TE constructs. In this study, we have shown, using a DoE approach that, when using an optimised sample preparation and staining protocol, highly quantitative datasets could be obtained {{despite the fact that the}} construct contained a metal-based scaffold. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In multirate processing, it {{is often}} {{necessary}} {{to understand how the}} statistical properties of signals (such as stationarity) are altered by passage through multirate systems. Some of these issues have been addressed in [1]. For example, it is shown in [1] that a necessary and sufficient condition for the output of an L-fold interpolation filter to be wide sense stationary (WSS) for all WSS inputs, is that the filter have an aliasfree(L) support. However this result was established using conventional tools such as polyphase matrices, which resulted in a convoluted derivation which does not provide much insight. It also leaves many questions unanswered, since it does not generalize easily to the case of systems with vector inputs. This paper shows that problems of this nature can be addressed in an elegant and <b>insightful</b> <b>manner</b> by using bifrequency maps [2],[3], and bispectra [4]. In particular, we give a simpler proof of the above-mentioned result of [1], and generalize it to the case of vector systems. 1...|$|E

40|$|Economic growth {{driven by}} the {{creation}} of new ideas, knowledge, and innovations is an interesting and challenging phenomenon to be modelled and analysed. Dominant approaches, like Romer’s endogenous growth models, Aghion-Howitt creative destruction growth models, RBC models, or the not so dominant ones, like that of the Neo-Austrians, of industrial structuralisms, or Nelson and Winter’s evolutionary theory, emphasize the need for modelling innovations in a comprehensive manner but fail to encapsulate the intrinsic indeterminacies of the innovational process in an <b>insightful</b> <b>manner.</b> Romer (1986, 1990, 1993), in his seminal works, has stressed the importance of modelling ideas and knowledge and showed how ideas can be encoded as information bit-strings, using the chemistry set metaphor. Zambelli (2004, 2005) developed the idea further, modelling an innovation process as a Turing Machine (TM) process and applied the TM metaphor within Romer’s endogenous growth model in an interesting way. But due to the time-less property of the production function, the dynamic interactions between the production and innovational processes could not be explored in detail. In this paper, we harness the intrinsic indeterminacies within the TM metaphor to model process innovations and analyse its dynamic interactions with the production processes within a time to build framework. 3...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a unified {{analysis}} of partitive constructions like 'one/some of the boxes 'which, unlike previous accounts, succeeds in accounting for (i) both their internal structure and the constraints on the embedded NP, and (ii) the relation between their internal structure and any such constraints. First, it is argued that four types of partitive can be distinguished, on the basis of two parameters: (1) the kind of entity denoted by the matrix NP (±set) and (2) the relation between the heads of the matrix and embedded NP (±co-denotational). Using authentic data, the paper subsequently shows that any constraints on the embedded NP apply to only two of these subtypes; it is further argued that these constraints follow directly from the specific properties of these partitives. This, in turn, is taken as evidence that partitives of this kind can be regarded simply as a subtype of the larger group of NPs with the structure N+PP. Finally, it is argued that Functional Discourse Grammar with its different levels and layers of analysis, allows us to capture all the relevant pragmatic, semantic and morphosyntactic properties of the different types of partitives in a systematic and <b>insightful</b> <b>manner...</b>|$|E
30|$|In this communication, {{a hybrid}} {{approach}} where, {{in addition to}} the defined multi-objective problem in Ighravwe et al. (2016 b), a novel concept of return-on-investment is considered. The original work of Ighravwe et al. (2016 b) was strongly laid on the foundation of technicians’ reliability wherein technicians’ productivity as well as earned values was considered. Motivated by the literature deficiency, limitations in maintenance literature as well as gaps in existing knowledge and practices in maintenance engineering, the proposed approach on return-on-workforce investment is an innovative addition to literature. This approach discards the restricted application of the age-long concept of return-on-investment (ROI) to physical assets in maintenance and offers a fresh look at the human side of this novel idea. ROI measures the ratio of profit compared to the total workforce value. Although it is applauded to be more beneficial in providing detailed information on workers’ performance than workers’ productivity in financial terms (Visier 2015), the realisation and beneficial application of ROI in maintenance practice has not been fulfilled until this present communication. Yet, another novel contribution of this paper is the distinctly <b>insightful</b> <b>manner</b> in which the fuzzy goal programming is formulated for the maintenance workforce problem. This has never been conceptualised in this form till the present research output. Coupling the DE and FGP in a new manner is also completely an addition to the literature.|$|E

Several movements, including Music Education as Aesthetic Education (MEAE), have offered conductors such a perspective; however, most have not utilized such an approach in practice. Conductors who are sympathetic to the idea of engaging students in educational interactions with performance repertoire do not lack access to theoretical and philosophical background; what they need are sufficiently detailed portraits of this type of effective teaching. ^ New York city native Robert Kapilow has enjoyed wide popularity for his enthusiastic and <b>insightful</b> <b>manner</b> of introducing classical music to new listeners. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore how Kapilow educates diverse audiences about music. Phenomenological and case study methods were used to explore (a) what music education meant to him, and (b) how this view influenced his practice of teaching and conducting. By exploring these questions, I gained a greater understanding of how the roles of conductor and music educator met in his professional life, and how his example of effective music teaching could inform the classroom practice of conductors. ^ Analysis of in-depth interviews and fieldnotes from participant/observations revealed Kapilow 2 ̆ 7 s experience of teaching music is characterized by the play of metaphors.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the role of}} EFL education, its potential and shortcomings, and the challenges the future of EFL education will bring. It is argued that new societal demands and the limited time we have at our disposal in the classroom make it necessary to rethink goals and content and {{move away from the}} transmissionof limited sets of facts and information to helping students develop awareness and competences that can be applied in many different situations, also in a perspective of lifelong learning. The overall aim of the current study is to problematize and increase understanding of the implementation of cultural aspects in the language classroom by addressing the interrelated what, why and how of the cultural dimension within EFL education. This has been conducted by means of theoretical explorations into the area, alongside an attempt at promoting intercultural competence (IC) in a more systematic and <b>insightful</b> <b>manner</b> within my own educational praxis. The focus of the intercultural work in the classroom was on the promotion of awareness of difference and diversity, as well as respect for such difference through the ability to decenter from cultural norms and behavior that previously have been taken for granted. These are two elements that have been suggested as fundamental for other work with IC in the classroom and for the realization of important aspects of the underlying values of basic education. In the context of this study, IC comprises several interconnected components supportingeach other in a variety of ways, with the further aim being interaction with and respect for difference in general, not only concerning e. g. representatives ofcertain English-speaking communities. The methodology was informed by action research, with myself {{in the role of the}} teacher-researcher or the reflective practitioner. For the purpose of the project I was authorized to take on the EFL education for the three years of upper comprehensive school of one random class of students originally assigned to one of the language teachers of the selected Finland-Swedish school. Thus, the class of 17 students was not specifically chosen for the project, and the aims and contents chosen for the development project were placed within the framework of the ordinary curriculum. By exploring the students¿ insights concerning different English-speaking cultural groups, mainly through a set of questionnaires, it was possible to outline the work with the cultural dimension in the classroom for the following three years. Work progress was evaluated at specific stages, and the final project evaluations were conducted through individual student interviews in grade 9. The interviews were focused on possible development of students¿ insights concerning different aspects of the cultural dimension. In particular this concerned awareness of difference and diversity, including modification of stereotypes, as well as the ability to decenterin order to be better able to respect such difference. I also explored students¿ awareness and views of the activities and approaches used in class, as well asaffordances both inside and outside the EFL classroom in relation to these intended insights. A further focus area was the perceived relevance to students of different aspects of the cultural dimension. The frameworks and approaches adopted for the work in the classroom all have in common that they are based on a constructivist framework, where knowledge is constructed and reconstructed through interaction with one¿s social and cultural environment, including interaction with others. Reflective processes precede or are simultaneous with the learning of basic factual knowledge. This entails a view of learning as a progression from simple to more complex models rather than as a progression from facts to understanding and analysis. Here, the development of intercultural competence is seen asa cyclical process, or along a spiral curriculum, from simple to more complex levels through a combination of cognitive, affective and behavioral elements within a framework of experiential learning. This project has shown one possible wayforward concerning the development of intercultural competence within EFL education through a more systematic and comprehensive approach regarding linguistic and cultural aspects. The evaluation of the educational process explored in the study suggests the possibilities for work with the promotion of awareness of difference and diversity concerning some specific context that, based on students¿ prior knowledge and preconceptions, would benefit from further work. In this case, the specific context primarily concerned different aspects of both cultural and linguistic conditions in the UK. It is also suggested that many students developed the ability to decenter, described in the study as integral to being able to respect otherness. What still remains to be explored are more individualized approaches considering students¿ different levels of departure. Further work alsoneeds to be put into how to apply insights gained in these specific situations to more general contexts. It is also necessary to explore the use of the suggested approaches in a wider range of different contexts...|$|E
