2500|$|Pattie Boyd {{invoked the}} {{designer}} in a 2007 Daily Mail interview, when speaking {{of her and}} her then-husband George Harrison's darker days: [...] "at times I felt almost suicidal. I don't think I was ever in any real danger of killing myself but I {{got as far as}} working out <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do it: put on a diaphanous Ossie Clark dress and throw myself off Beachy Head." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2014, artist Boo Sze Yang {{presented}} The Father at iPreciation Gallery, a {{solo exhibition}} featuring eight oil-on-canvas portraits of Lee in unconventional settings, like an embellished throne or {{a scene that}} depicts the Last Supper. [...] In regard to his opinion of Lee, Boo was quoted as saying, [...] "I look at him as <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> look at my own father, a powerful and distant figure for whom I have mixed feelings – a lot of gratitude, but also doubt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{said that}} Lucas, who was {{consumed}} by {{the details of the}} complicated production, [...] "avoided all meetings and contact with me from day one, so I read the extra-long script many times and made my own decisions as to <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> shoot the picture." [...] He also [...] "took it upon myself to experiment with photographing the lightsabers and other things onstage before we moved on to our two weeks of location work in Tunisia". Taylor was aware of the [...] "enormous amount of process work" [...] to follow principal photography and believed [...] "a crisp result would help".|$|E

2500|$|Classical and {{playback}} singer Manna Dey, who {{was also}} a contemporary of Rafi said, [...] "Rafi and I could sing everything, and he was such a gentleman. He was a better singer than me, and I will say this – that no one came even close to him! He deserved everything he got! We had a great understanding and it was never about one-upmanship". Veteran actor Shammi Kapoor said, [...] "I am incomplete without Mohammad Rafi. I used to often go for the recording of my song, which was sung by Mohammad Rafi, only because I used to like telling him <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> perform on this song on screen so that he can sing it that way. Even he liked my involvement".|$|E
2500|$|Big Black's music {{challenged}} convention, pursuing an abrasive {{sound that}} was more aggressive than contemporary punk rock. Albini explained that the band strove for intensity, stating that their goal was to make [...] "something that felt intense when we went through it, rather than something that had little coded indicators of intensity. Heavy metal {{and stuff like that}} didn't really seem intense to me, it seemed comical to me. Hardcore punk didn't really seem intense most of the time — {{most of the time it}} just seemed childish. I guess that's <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> differentiate what we were doing from what other people were doing." [...] Both Albini and Riley described Big Black as a punk rock band. Other sources have classified the band as post-punk, indie rock, noise rock, alternative rock, and post-hardcore.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{recording}} of [...] "Money for Nothing", the signature sound of Knopfler's guitar may have been enhanced by a [...] "happy accident" [...] of microphone placement. Knopfler was using his Gibson Les Paul going through a Laney amplifier. While setting up the guitar amplifier microphones {{in an effort to}} get the [...] "ZZ Top sound" [...] that Knopfler was after, guitar tech Ron Eve, who was in the control room, heard the [...] "amazing" [...] sound before Dorfsman was finished arranging the mics. [...] "One mic was pointing down at the floor," [...] Dorfsman remembered, [...] "another was not quite on the speaker, another was somewhere else, and it wasn't <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> want to set things up—it was probably just left from the night before, when I'd been preparing things for the next day and had not really finished the setup." [...] What they heard was exactly what ended up on the record; no additional processing or effects were used during the mix.|$|E

2500|$|Spain under Zapatero {{turned its}} focus to Europe from the United States, {{pursuing}} a middle road {{in dealing with}} tensions between Western powers and Islamic populations. In a May 2007 interview with El País, Daniel Fried, Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs, commenting on the overall relationship between Spain and the United States, stated: [...] "We work together very well on some issues. I think the Spanish–American relationship can develop more. I think some Spanish officials are knowledgeable and very skilled professionals and we work with them very well. I {{would like to see}} Spain active in the world, working through NATO, active in Afghanistan. You're doing a lot in the Middle East because Moratinos knows a lot about it. But Spain is a big country and your economy is huge. I think Spain can be a force for security and peace and freedom in the world. I believe that Spain has that potential, and that's <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to see Spanish–American relations developing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, Ed Droste {{described}} Shields as Grizzly Bear's [...] "most verbose album" [...] yet, noting, [...] "It's funny, because I {{think back}} to a song like [...] "Colorado", where I was basically singing ten words {{over and over again}} for five minutes straight – and that's it. There's nothing on this album like that. There's a lot more there, verbally, and it's definitely emotionally charged." [...] Bassist and producer, Chris Taylor stated, [...] "For this record, it was really important to us to try and make sure that lyrics had a weight to them and at least some sense of a narrative, even if it was loose. There were lyrics in previous albums that seemed to have no meaning whatsoever. And that always really annoyed me. We agreed it'd be really important and awesome if we could just try and make all the lyrics tell something. [...] I was definitely able to use lyrics as a frame to <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> let the arrangements build and then fall away." ...|$|E
2500|$|In self-analysis, Jackson {{uncovered}} vital details regarding her past, saying, [...] "Certain {{things may}} happen, {{and you just}} dismiss them instead of stopping and saying, [...] "Why am I feeling this way? Why am I acting out in this way?" [...] She had suppressed various traumas throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, using evasion tactics to prevent thoughts from surfacing. She also recalled feeling unaccepted and ostracized for her skin color. She was persistently haunted by a memory of a school teacher intensely scolding her, causing her classmates to erupt in laughter. [...] "Oh, God, it sounds so stupid. But being a kid you're just so frightened... I never talked about it, so it stayed with me all those years. I felt not deserving, not good enough... that's still the way I feel about myself sometimes", she declared. As a child, she managed discomfort by speaking to her animals, later turning to overeating as an anesthetic, causing fluctuations in weight. Jackson said, [...] "I {{began to realize that}} whenever something really painful was going on, I would eat, and that's <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> run away from it. But I would just be creating another problem in another area instead of just dealing with that pain".|$|E

6000|$|DEAR MR. FULTON,--I remember, {{as if it}} were yesterday, {{that when}} I disembarked from the {{overland}} stage in front of the Ormsby in Carson City in August, 1861, I was not expecting to be asked to come again. I was tired, discouraged, white with alkali dust, and did not know anybody; and if you had said then, [...] "Cheer up, desolate stranger, don't be down-hearted--pass on, and come again in 1905," [...] you cannot think <b>how</b> grateful <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have been and <b>how</b> gladly <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have closed the contract. Although I was not expecting to be invited, I was watching out for it, and was hurt and disappointed when you started to ask me and changed it to, [...] "How soon are you going away?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Javed Akhtar narrates: [...] "Kamal sahab {{gave me a}} job {{and helped}} me. My salary was Rs.50 {{and even in the}} 60s, you could not rent a house with that amount of money. I used to sleep {{in a corner of the}} studio. I started living in the costume room of the studio. I didn't have enough money to even go out to have a meal. In the evenings I would just potter around in the drawers. There were many {{cupboards}} filled with costumes of Pakeezah; sherwanis, dresses, shoes. One day I opened a drawer and found amid the clutter, three Filmfare trophies. I dusted them and realized they were Meena Kumari's Filmfare trophies. I had never held a trophy and a Filmfare trophy was akin to the Oscar in India. There were big mirrors in the room. In the evenings I would come back and lock myself in the costume room and hold the trophies in front of the mirror, acting <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> accept it if I were to receive it. The first trophy I held in my hand was that of Meena Kumari! I was an eighteen-year-old boy who had no home, no money, no food, but these trophies encouraged me to achieve my dreams, and for this, I will be always thankful to Meena-ji." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "My lack {{of fear of}} this barbaric {{methodology}} of death, I rely upon my faith. It {{has nothing to do}} with machismo, with manhood, or with some pseudo former gang street code. This is pure faith, and predicated on my redemption. So, therefore, I just stand strong and continue to tell you, your audience, and the world that I am innocent and, yes, I have been a wretched person, but I have redeemed myself. And I say to you and all those who can listen and will listen that redemption is tailor-made for the wretched, and that's what I used to be…That's what I would like the world to remember me. That's <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like my legacy to be remembered as: a redemptive transition, something that I believe is not exclusive just for the so-called sanctimonious, the elitists. And it doesn't—is not predicated on color or race or social stratum or one's religious background. It's accessible for everybody. That's the beauty about it. And whether others choose to believe that I have redeemed myself or not, I worry not, because I know and God knows, and you can believe that all of the youths that I continue to help, they know, too. So with that, I am grateful…I say to you and everyone else, God bless. So take care." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 30, 2014, dissenters {{released}} a [...] "controversial, vulgar" [...] rant Driscoll had written under the pseudonym [...] "William Wallace II" [...] in 2000, dubbed the [...] "Pussified Nation" [...] rant. The rant contained [...] "blunt and emotional comments critical of feminism, homosexual behavior, and 'sensitive emasculated' men", {{and called for}} [...] "real men" [...] to rise up {{in the spirit of}} Scottish warrior William Wallace as depicted in the film Braveheart. Mars Hill Church had long since deleted their unmoderated [...] "Midrash" [...] discussion board where the forum postings occurred. Driscoll referenced the incident in his 2006 book Confessions of Reformission Rev, where he confirmed and expressed regret that, though he believed his intentions were [...] "good", he had personally written the rant. He wrote in 2006, [...] "I had a good mission, but some of my tactics were born out of anger and burnout, and I did a lot of harm and damage while attracting a lot of attention." [...] Driscoll responded to the release of the rant {{in a letter to his}} congregation, writing that [...] "the content of my postings to that discussion board does not reflect how I feel or <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> conduct myself today." [...] On September 8, 2014, blogger Libby Anne republished other examples of material written by [...] "William Wallace II" [...] in 2001, and remarked she had “rarely seen an evangelical man assert male superiority and prominence this directly.” ...|$|E
