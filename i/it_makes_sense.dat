5|$|In the Puppet Theater minigame, {{the player}} is tasked with {{finishing}} the script {{of an ongoing}} play so that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense.</b> If the player chooses a word {{that does not make}} sense {{in the context of the}} play, the play abruptly ends and the player is asked to try again; if all of the right words are chosen, the play is given an epilogue and an audience applauds.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{evolutionary}} theory continues to develop. Darwin's {{theory of evolution}} by natural selection, with its tree-like model of branching common descent, has become the unifying theory of the life sciences. The theory explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> of the geologic record, biogeography, parallels in embryonic development, biological homologies, vestigiality, cladistics, phylogenetics and other fields, with unrivalled explanatory power; it has also become essential to applied sciences such as medicine and agriculture. Despite the scientific consensus, a religion-based political controversy has developed over how evolution is taught in schools, especially in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{retrospective}} {{reviews of}} the Genesis version, Dynamite Headdy has continued to receive considerable praise. Critics agreed that the game is excellent despite not receiving the same legendary status as some of Treasure's other works such as Gunstar Heroes, Ikaruga, and Radiant Silvergun. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN said the game is overload on the eyes, but <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> with respect to Treasure's chaotic design. Frank Provo of GameSpot noted the game's impressive graphical effects, large bosses, and bizarre premise providing {{the same level of}} excitement as Gunstar Heroes. Damien McFarren of Nintendo Life called it one of the best Treasure games of the Genesis era {{and one of the best}} platformers on the system.|$|E

5|$|The parity of zero is {{relevant}} to odd–even rationing, in which cars may drive or purchase gasoline on alternate days, according to the parity of the last digit in their license plates. Half of the numbers in a given range end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 {{and the other half}} in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, so <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> to include 0 with the other even numbers. However, in 1977, a Paris rationing system led to confusion: on an odd-only day, the police avoided fining drivers whose plates ended in 0, because they did not know whether 0 was even. To avoid such confusion, the relevant legislation sometimes stipulates that zero is even; such laws have been passed in New South Wales and Maryland.|$|E

On the other hand, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> no <b>sense</b> to speak of the internal energy at a point, while when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> good <b>sense</b> to speak of the temperature at a point. Consequently, temperature can vary from point to point in a medium that is not in global thermodynamic equilibrium, but in which there is local thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|R

25|$|Early {{resistors}} {{were made}} in more or less arbitrary round numbers; a series might have 100, 125, 150, 200, 300, etc. Resistors as manufactured are subject to a certain percentage tolerance, and <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> to manufacture values that correlate with the tolerance, so that the actual value of a resistor overlaps slightly with its neighbors. Wider spacing leaves gaps; narrower spacing increases manufacturing and inventory costs to provide resistors that {{are more or less}} interchangeable.|$|E

Liability for defective products is strict (see strict liability) in most jurisdictions. The theory of risk spreading provides support for this approach. Since manufacturers are the 'cheapest cost avoiders', {{because they have a}} greater chance to seek out problems, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> to give them the incentive to guard against product defects.|$|E

Unicode classifies 丟 and 丢 as each other's respective traditional and simplified variants and also as each other's semantic variants. However, while Unicode classifies 億 (U+5104)and 亿 (U+4EBF) as each other's respective traditional and simplified variants, Unicode does not consider 億 and 亿 to be semantic variants of each other.|$|E
25|$|ABC {{analysis}} {{is a method}} for analyzing inventory based on Pareto distribution, it posits that since revenue from items on inventory will be power law distributed then <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> to manage items differently based on their position on a revenue-inventory level matrix, 3 classes are constructed (A,B and C) from cumulative item revenues, so in a matrix each item will have a letter (A,B or C) assigned for revenue and inventory. This method posits that items away from the diagonal should be managed differently: items in the upper part are subject to risk of obsolescence, items in the lower part are subject to risk of stockout.|$|E
25|$|Human {{security}} can {{be defined}} as one of the foundational conditions of being human, including both (1) the sustainable protection and provision of the material conditions for meeting the embodied needs of people, and (2) the protection of the variable existential conditions for maintaining a dignified life. Within this definition it then makes sense that the core focus of human-security endeavours should be on the most vulnerable. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> that risk management should be most responsive to immediate events or processes that have both an extensive and intensive impact in producing material and existential vulnerabilities of people in general or a category of persons across a particular locale.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} {{important}} differences between the Masoretic and Samaritan version of the Pentateuch in the readings of many sentences. Some distinctions seem motivated by (or reflect) actual philosophical differences between Judaism and Samaritanism. Some of these are glaringly obvious, like {{the inclusion of a}} passage in the Samaritan version of the Ten Commandments that restates the command to build an altar on Mt. Gerizim, and says plainly that Mt. Gerizim is the site where all future sacrifices must be offered. Since the location of God's holy site is probably the central original difference between Judaism and Samaritanism, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> that this passage is in one version and not the other.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{morphological}} differences between queens and workers of P. sericea. Generally, queens {{are larger than}} workers in the abdominal region, but have smaller head width and wing length. Queens {{are the only ones}} with well-developed ovarioles, mature oocytes and sperm-filled spermathecae. Workers' ovaries are either underdeveloped or not developed at all, and so they are not reproductive. Queens perform the reproductive tasks of the colony, while workers forage for resources such as food and nest-building materials. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> that workers would have larger brains and wings because they must hunt and forage for food. The morphological differences seen in this caste differentiation are also seen with the species Protopolybia chartergoides and Polybia rejecta.|$|E
25|$|The migratory {{ability is}} ranked {{tertiary}} > secondary > aryl > primary. Allylic groups {{are more apt}} to migrate than primary alkyl groups but less so than secondary alkyl groups. Electron-withdrawing groups on the substituent decrease the rate of migration. There are two explanations for this trend in migration ability. One explanation relies on the buildup of positive charge in the transition state for breakdown of the Criegee intermediate (illustrated by the carbocation resonance structure of the Criegee intermediate). Keeping this structure in mind, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> that the substituent that can maintain positive charge the best would be most likely to migrate. The higher the degree of substitution, the more stable a carbocation generally is. Therefore, the tertiary > secondary > primary trend is observed.|$|E
