25|$|The {{inevitable}} {{combat and}} chase sequences in the James Bond theme are handled by Action Rounds, representing 3–5 seconds of time. All characters {{involved in a}} chase or combat declare their actions in reverse order of Speed (1-3, based on the sum of Perception and Dexterity), then executed in order of speed, giving faster characters the advantages of knowing what slower characters are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> {{being able to take}} their action earlier. Speed also affects how many attacks a character may make in a round.|$|E
500|$|While {{the music}} of Henry Cow was highly orchestrated and structured, Frith also began to {{experiment}} with unstructured music, using prepared instruments and chance composition. In June 1974, {{after the release of}} Henry Cow's second album, Virgin Records (Henry Cow's record label) commissioned a solo record from Frith. They were impressed with his musical ability and gave him free rein to record whatever he wanted. In a 2001 radio interview, Frith said he used the opportunity as a challenge: [...] "I said to myself ... in two weeks time I'm going to go into the studio and I have no idea what I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> I'm going to kind of reinvent the instrument for myself." [...] Frith spent four days in July 1974 recording at the Kaleidophon Studios in London, and the resulting experimentation and the process of galvanisation and pressure led to the [...] "radical approach to the guitar" [...] on the album. In October 1974, Virgin released the album as Guitar Solos on their budget label, Caroline Records.|$|E
500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness—for which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"—he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, and I discovered he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that will work on account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea and maybe it will work. John, now, he's a take-charge guy... you what the other guy's going to do, what he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> what he wants you to do.|$|E

Smarty Jones was bred at Chapman's Someday Farm (Patricia {{explains}} the name: [...] "Some day we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this <b>and</b> some day we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that. <b>And</b> my husband said, 'I {{think we ought to}} call it Someday Farm,' so we did.") near Philadelphia, and had Philadelphia Park (now Parx Racing) as his home course.|$|R

500|$|... "Redux" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Todd VanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club, awarded {{the first episode}} a C+ rating and wrote that [...] "'Redux ' {{was a pretty good}} episode back in 1997. It’s not a very good episode now". VanDerWerff noted that the idea that Mulder had killed himself was not effective because the show's audience knew that a movie had been scheduled for release in the summer of 1998. Finally, he called the episode's ending [...] "one of the show’s weaker cliffhangers". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave {{the first part of the}} episode a negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She heavily criticized the story's pacing, noting that the episode [...] "is all plot, plot, plot. [...] much of the plot is unbelievable." [...] Furthermore, Vitaris criticized several plot holes in the episode, including Mulder's easy entrance into the Department of Defense and the characters antics, such as his attack of Ostelhoff. However, despite the overall negative review, Vitaris did mention that, [...] "There's only one truly galvanizing scene, as that's the confrontation between Scully and Skinner after he follows her to the lab where she is performing her DNA test." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two heavily criticized the [...] "Skinner-as-traitor" [...] plot, noting sardonically that [...] "the production team aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> , <b>and</b> the shock 'villain in the room' reveal will be Section Chief Blevins–a character so important in the framework of the series that, barring his appearance in the Season Four finale, we haven't seen him in ninety-four episodes." [...] Not all reviews were so negative. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files named [...] "Redux" [...] and [...] "Redux II", together, as the tenth best [...] "Episode of All Time". In his critique of [...] "Redux", he noted [...] "While many people don't care for 'Redux', I think it does a good job of preparing us for the second hour (although, it invalidates Gillian's emotional context from the S4 finale)." [...] In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, [...] "Redux" [...] (along with [...] "Gethsemane" [...] and [...] "Redux II") was presented as the [...] "Best Mythology Episode".|$|E

2500|$|Simon {{believed}} modern Presidents practice [...] "followership," [...] {{rather than}} leadership", saying, [...] "We {{have been more}} and more leaning on opinion polls to decide what we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> you don't get leadership from polls... and not just at the Presidential level.

2500|$|The F8-VII was {{described}} by the team as a solid base on which to build, as they had {{a relatively short period}} of time to produce the new F1 car. James Key, the technical director of Spyker F1, said, [...] "We also tried to second guess as best we could what the 2007 tyres were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> we worked hard on aero, which is of course always the fundamental thing. That way we could concentrate all our efforts on performance related areas." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "One of the {{original}} ideas for this album was to have no percussion whatsoever. We ended up having to use it but we limited {{it as much as}} we could. We usually have some sort of mental picture of what we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> set out all sorts of guidelines for ourselves to get there. But {{as soon as we get}} working, the process takes precedence. The control room gets out of control, in a manner of speaking. We start with lots of belief in ourselves and our abilities, and end up in nothing but mistrust and dissolution.” ...|$|E

2500|$|On December 7, 1980, Taylor had an {{encounter}} with Mark David Chapman, who would assassinate John Lennon just one day later. Taylor told the BBC in 2010: [...] "The guy had sort of pinned me {{to the wall and}} was glistening with maniacal sweat and talking some freak speak about what he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> his stuff with how John was interested, {{and he was going to}} get in touch with John Lennon. And it was surreal to actually have contact with the guy 24 hours before he shot John." [...] The next night, Taylor, who lived in the next building from Lennon, heard the assassination occur. Taylor commented: [...] "I heard him shot—five, just as quick as you could pull the trigger, about five explosions." ...|$|E
