40|$|In this {{bachelor}} thesis {{the internal}} communication of Tartu <b>Higher</b> <b>Art</b> School was researched at {{the period of}} changes. The new principal was engaged there on the 1 st of January. Also the organizational climate of Tartu <b>Higher</b> <b>Art</b> Scool was studied and regarded how it has changed after the designation of the new principal. Firstly the theoretical basis was presented, which was devided into three parts: systemtheories where organiztions` communication with its environment was explained as an intersystematic process with mutual impact, communicationtheories where the importance of an organizational communication was explained and change managing theories. In describing the theoretical basis also the areas of interest of this research were noted while analyzing the empirical material. The empirical part of the research can be devided into two:  a questionnaire among the employees of Tartu <b>Higher</b> <b>Art</b> School, in April 2005  interviews with two employees from different structural units As {{a result of the}} research, conlusions were made about the main problems of Tartu <b>Higher</b> <b>Art</b> School`s communication and organizational climate. Empirical material was analyzed {{on the basis of the}} division used in the questionnaire:  the changes and the communication of the changes;  information flow in Tartu <b>Higher</b> <b>Art</b> School;  contentment of teamwork and motivation to work in Tartu <b>Higher</b> <b>Art</b> School;  organizational climate The conclusions were made on the basis of information gathered from the questionnaires and interviews. The results of the analysis were also compared with the thoeretical basis described in the research. Finally the suggestions were given to the management to Tartu <b>Higher</b> <b>Art</b> School for planning and communicating the further innovations and changes more effectively...|$|R

25|$|One {{characteristic}} of postmodern art is its conflation {{of high and}} low culture through the use of industrial materials and pop culture imagery. The use of low forms of art were a part of modernist experimentation as well, as documented in Kirk Varnedoe and Adam Gopnik's 1990–91 show High and Low: Popular Culture and Modern Art at New York's Museum of Modern Art, an exhibition that was universally panned at the time as the only event that could bring Douglas Crimp and Hilton Kramer together in a chorus of scorn. Postmodern art is noted for {{the way in which it}} blurs the distinctions between what is perceived as fine or <b>high</b> <b>art</b> and what is generally seen as low or kitsch art. Whilst this concept of 'blurring' or 'fusing' <b>high</b> <b>art</b> with low art had been experimented during modernism, it only ever became fully endorsed after the advent of the postmodern era. Postmodernism introduced elements of commercialism, kitsch and a general camp aesthetic within its artistic context; postmodernism takes styles from past periods, such as Gothicism, the Renaissance and the Baroque, and mixes them so as to ignore their original use in their corresponding artistic movement. Such elements are common characteristics of what defines postmodern art.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominance}} of neoclassical sculpture lessened {{in the later}} 19th century, and the following generation of Birmingham sculptors was largely defined by {{its relationship with the}} Birmingham School of Art, which under Edward R. Taylor emphasised the relationship between <b>high</b> <b>art</b> and craftsmanship, and was closely aligned to Birmingham's dominant Civic Gospel ideology. Albert Toft was a prominent exponent of the New Sculpture, his works exhibiting the movement's characteristic naturalism in form and spiritualism in mood. Benjamin Creswick was the leading sculptor of the Arts and Crafts-dominated Birmingham Group, working {{in a wide variety of}} genres and expanding the iconography of Birmingham sculpture with imagery of working men and compositions examining the relationship between arts, crafts and learning.|$|E
25|$|Gullah {{culture is}} also being celebrated {{elsewhere}} in the United States. The <b>High</b> <b>Art</b> Museum in Atlanta has presented exhibits about Gullah culture. The Black Cultural Center at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana conducted a research tour, cultural arts festival, and other related events to showcase the Gullah culture. The Black Cultural Center Library maintains a bibliography of Gullah books and materials, as well. Metro State College in Denver, Colorado recently hosted a conference on Gullah culture, called The Water Brought Us: Gullah History and Culture, which featured a panel of Gullah scholars and cultural activists. These events in Indiana and Colorado are typical of the attention Gullah culture regularly receives throughout the United States.|$|E

25|$|The {{ignition}} {{point for the}} definition of modernism as a movement was the austere rejection of popular culture as kitsch by important post-war artists and taste-makers, most notably Clement Greenberg with his essay Avant-Garde and Kitsch, first published in Partisan Review in 1939. During the 1940s and 1950s Greenberg {{proved to be an}} articulate and powerful art critic. In particular his writing on American Abstract expressionism, and 20th-century European modernism persuasively made the case for <b>High</b> <b>art</b> and culture. In 1961 Art and Culture, Beacon Press, a highly influential collection of essays by Clement Greenberg was first published. Greenberg is primarily thought of as a formalist art critic and many of his most important essays are crucial to the understanding of Modern art history, and the history of modernism and Late Modernism.|$|E
25|$|The {{other two}} groups of protesters, however, {{maintained}} their positions for weeks to come. The art gallery closed {{for the duration of}} the occupation, probably more because of the spectacle of shabbily dressed homeless men juxtaposed against the opulent exhibits of <b>high</b> <b>art</b> than for any logistical reasons. The RCPU emphasized discipline among its members in order to win rather than alienate public sympathy, which was evident at the other two locations that remained open to the public. Chief Constable Colonel W. W. Foster attempted to persuade the men to leave, telling them that they had made their point and should now go home. Brodie responded that if they had homes, they would be in them, and invited the colonel to arrest them. They offered to submit to arrest peacefully, and continued to do so {{for the duration of the}} occupation. Foster refused, and instead sought to manage the situation rather than clog the local prison with 1000 demonstrators and giving them the publicity they sought. The attorney-general agreed with Colonel Foster that the strikers would likely vacate on their own in a matter of days. But even as the strike dragged on from days into weeks, the police stood by awaiting orders before proceeding with an eviction. Colonel Foster had earned a reputation for diplomacy with the unemployed during the 1935 strike, which he appeared to be cultivating again in 1938. Behind the scenes, however, Foster was plotting with politicians and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to evacuate the post office and art gallery.|$|E
500|$|Bach uses {{scoring and}} {{especially}} instrumentation {{to illustrate the}} contrast of poverty and abundance. While all recitatives are secco, and the strings are silent for the first aria which is supported only by the oboes da caccia in low register, a festive orchestra with three kinds of wind instruments and strings accompanies not only, as usual, the opening chorus and the closing chorale, but also the penultimate movement, a tenor aria expressing how the believer gives his heart as a present. Hofmann notes that Bach [...] "combines <b>high</b> <b>art</b> with the folk style".|$|E

500|$|Icelandic singer Björk was a {{prominent}} purveyor of art pop for her wide-ranging integration of disparate forms of art and popular culture. During the 1990s, she became art pop's most commercially successful artist. Discussing Björk in 2015, Jason Farago of The Guardian wrote: [...] "The last 30 years in art history are in large part a story of collaborative enterprises, of collapsed boundaries between <b>high</b> <b>art</b> and low, and {{of the end of}} divisions between media. Few cultural figures have made the distinctions seem as meaningless as the Icelandic singer who combined trip hop with 12-tone, and who brought the avant garde to MTV just before both those things disappeared." ...|$|E
500|$|According to The Greenwood Encyclopedia of African American Folklore (2006), Fear of a Black Planet {{introduced}} a production style that [...] "borrowed elements from jazz, especially that of John Coltrane, {{to craft a}} soundscape that was more challenging than that of their previous two albums, but still complemented the complex social commentary". Journalist Kembrew McLeod called the music [...] "both agitprop and pop, mixing politics with the live-wire thrill of the popular music experience", adding that the Bomb Squad [...] "took sampling {{to the level of}} <b>high</b> <b>art</b> while keeping intact hip hop's populist heart. They would graft together dozens of fragmentary samples to create a single song collage." [...] Simon Reynolds said it was [...] "a work of unprecedented density for hip hop, its claustrophobic, backs-against-the-wall feel harking back to Sly Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On or even Miles Davis' On the Corner".|$|E
500|$|Maus {{looms large}} not only over Spiegelman's body of work, {{but over the}} comics medium itself. [...] While Spiegelman {{was far from the}} first to do {{autobiography}} in comics, critics such as James Campbell considered Maus the work that popularized it. [...] The bestseller has been widely written about in the popular press and academia—the quantity of its critical literature far outstrips that of any other work of comics. [...] It has been examined from a great variety of academic viewpoints, though most often by those with little understanding of Maus context in the history of comics. [...] While Maus has been credited with lifting comics from popular culture into the world of <b>high</b> <b>art</b> in the public imagination, criticism has tended to ignore its deep roots in popular culture, roots that Spiegelman has intimate familiarity with and has devoted considerable time to promote.|$|E

500|$|Italian {{music has}} been held up in high esteem in history and many pieces of Italian music are {{considered}} <b>high</b> <b>art.</b> More than other elements of Italian culture, music is generally eclectic, but unique from other nations' music. No parochial protectionist movement has ever attempted to keep Italian music pure and free from foreign influence, except briefly under the Fascist regime of the 1920s and 30s. [...] As a result, Italian music has kept elements of the many peoples that have dominated or influenced the country, including French, German, and Spanish. The country's historical contributions to music are also {{an important part of}} national pride. The relatively recent history of Italy includes the development of an opera tradition that has spread throughout the world; prior to the development of Italian identity or a unified Italian state, the Italian peninsula contributed to important innovations in music including the development of musical notation and Gregorian chant.|$|E
500|$|Cultural theorist Mark Fisher {{characterized}} {{a variety}} of musical developments in the late 1970s, including post-punk, industrial music, synthpop, and particularly the work of German electronic band Kraftwerk, as situated within art pop traditions. He states that Bowie and Roxy Music's English style of art pop [...] "culminated" [...] with {{the music of the}} British group Japan. The Quietus characterized Japan's 1979 album Quiet Life as defining [...] "a very European form of detached, sexually-ambiguous and thoughtful art-pop" [...] similar to that explored by Bowie on 1977's Low. Brian Eno and John Cale would serve a crucial part in the careers of Bowie, Talking Heads, and many key punk and post-punk records. [...] Following the amateurism of the punk movement, post-punk era saw a return to the art school tradition previously embodied by the work of Bowie and Roxy Music, with artists drawing ideas from literature, art, cinema, and critical theory into musical and pop cultural contexts while refusing the common distinction between <b>high</b> <b>art</b> and low culture. An emphasis on multimedia performance and visual art became common.|$|E
500|$|Amy Phillips of Pitchfork Media commended Gaga's {{performance}} {{saying that}} it was [...] "amazing as usual– a master class in over-the-top theatrics, campy gender-bending, and cheeky fun... But it was almost beside the point. The whole Gaga machine, the whole Gaga world we were immersed in– that was the point. It was overwhelming, all consuming. Something even the best album promo cycles only dream of being." [...] Phillips wondered how Gaga would be able to [...] "top" [...] the ArtRave event and listed it as an unprecedented promotional tool for an artist's album release cycle. Billboard Andrew Hampp and Jason Lipshutz compared Gaga's outfit to a [...] "bizarro" [...] version of Jack Box, the mascot for Jack in the Box, and wrote that the lip-synched portion of her performance was [...] "more pop art than artistic pop music." [...] Hampp and Lipshutz summarized their experience by writing, [...] "Even if the 'ARTPOP' live show still needs a bit of tinkering to fully captivate, Lady Gaga showed on Sunday night that she knows how to meld low art and <b>high</b> <b>art</b> at a party." [...] Michael Baggs of Gigwise described the concert as [...] "sparse but impressive" [...] and wrote that Gaga appeared [...] "wide-eyed and slightly manic... but impressed with live vocals and a hugely energetic performance." ...|$|E
