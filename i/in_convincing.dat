5|$|Drum is Zola Maseko's {{first feature}} film. He {{originally}} {{wanted to tell}} Sophiatown's story in a six-part television series called Sophiatown Short Stories. Unsuccessful <b>in</b> <b>convincing</b> the South African Television Company to pursue such a series, he decided to change the medium to that of film. He secured {{a large amount of}} his funding by convincing Taye Diggs to fill the lead role.|$|E
5|$|In 1818, the Chambers {{passed a}} {{military}} law that increased {{the size of}} the army by over 100,000. In October of the same year, Louis XVIII's foreign minister, the Duke of Richelieu, succeeded <b>in</b> <b>convincing</b> the powers to withdraw their armies early in exchange for a sum of over 200million francs.|$|E
5|$|In 1862 he was {{appointed}} abbot of the Surb Karapet Monastery near Mush, which meant {{he was also the}} prelate of Taron. He revitalized the monastery and transformed it into a flourishing center. He founded a school there and a journal, called Artsvik Tarono. He succeeded <b>in</b> <b>convincing</b> the wali (governor) of the Erzurum Vilayet to lower taxes for Armenians.|$|E

5|$|There {{was also}} {{speculation}} that the rejection may have been, in part, retaliation for French involvement <b>in</b> <b>convincing</b> the Swiss not to purchase American-made LTV A-7 Corsair II aircraft that had been competing against a French design, the Dassault Milan. In the end, the Swiss did not purchase either aircraft, opting for the Northrop F-5E Tiger II instead.|$|E
5|$|Because the Lithuanians did {{not have}} a list of PMO members, they did not arrest the main leaders. Also, provincial PMO {{branches}} remained intact. Therefore, on September 17, 1919, new orders were issued scheduling the second coup attempt for the end of September. This attempt was also discovered. A Lithuanian woman succeeded <b>in</b> <b>convincing</b> Petras Vrubliauskas, PMO deputy commander in Vilnius, to transfer the PMO document archive to the Lithuanians. On September 21, the Lithuanians obtained a full list of PMO members and supporters and arrested them in the following days. The PMO branch in Lithuania ceased to function and was liquidated.|$|E
5|$|First-class cricket resumed in 1945–46 {{after the}} Allied victory, and Brown began the post-war phase {{of his career}} with a steady season, scoring 604 runs at 46.46 with five half-centuries in seven matches. This placed him second to Sid Barnes in the run-scoring aggregates. His best effort was a 98 against South Australia, denied a century by a run out. Queensland lost more than they won, with two {{victories}} and three losses. At {{the end of the}} season, Brown captained an Australian side on a tour of New Zealand, and all five matches resulted <b>in</b> <b>convincing</b> victories.|$|E

5|$|In 1698, the Company of Scotland {{attempted}} {{a project to}} secure a trading colony on the Isthmus of Panama. Almost every Scottish landowner who had money to spare {{is said to have}} invested in the Darien scheme. Its failure bankrupted these landowners, but not the burghs. Nevertheless, the nobles' bankruptcy, along with the threat of an English invasion, played a leading role <b>in</b> <b>convincing</b> the Scots elite to back a union with England.|$|E
5|$|Matsui {{retired from}} active duty in 1935 but was called back into service in August 1937 {{at the start}} of the Second Sino-Japanese War to lead the Japanese forces engaged in the Battle of Shanghai. After winning the battle Matsui succeeded <b>in</b> <b>convincing</b> Japan's high command to advance on the Chinese capital city of Nanking. The troops under his command who {{captured}} Nanking on December 13 were responsible for the notorious Nanking Massacre.|$|E
5|$|The synagogue's {{fortunes}} {{improved in}} the 1940s, but in 1946, its bank threatened to foreclose on its buildings, {{in anticipation of}} their sale to the local Catholic diocese, as the congregation had not paid the mortgage in many years. The congregation succeeded <b>in</b> <b>convincing</b> the bank to re-negotiate its mortgage, and reduce the outstanding loan, and Max Koeppel led a drive to pay it off completely.|$|E

5|$|Van Meegeren was a {{prolific}} artist and produced thousands of original paintings {{in a number}} of diverse styles. This wide range in painting and drawing styles often irritated art critics. Some of his typical works are classical still lifes <b>in</b> <b>convincing</b> 17th century manner, Impressionistic paintings of people frolicking on lakes or beaches, jocular drawings where the subject is drawn with rather odd features, Surrealistic paintings with combined fore- and backgrounds. Van Meegeren's portraits, however, are probably his finest works.|$|E
5|$|After Gebhard's expulsion, Ernst assumed full {{charge of}} the Electorate of Cologne. In his later years, a nuncio at Cologne took {{responsibilities}} for the financial administration of the archdiocese, and Ernst's nephew, Ferdinand of Bavaria, {{was elected to the}} Cathedral Chapter, the Wittelsbach heir-apparent. When Ernst died in 1612, the Cathedral Chapter duly elected his nephew to the position and Wittelsbachs held the Electorate until 1761. Ernst's victory, both in winning the election in 1583, and <b>in</b> <b>convincing</b> the assembly of other electors to accept him in 1585, confirmed him as the new archbishop of Cologne and gave the Wittelsbach family a foothold on the northern Rhine.|$|E
5|$|After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), many Poles {{believed}} that revolutionary France, whose public opinion was very {{sympathetic to the}} ideals of the Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791, would come to Poland's aid. France's enemies included Poland's partitioners, Prussia, Austria and Imperial Russia. Paris was the seat of two Polish organizations laying the claim to be the Polish government-in-exile, the Deputation (Deputacja) of Franciszek Ksawery Dmochowski and the Agency (Agencja) of Józef Wybicki. Many Polish soldiers, officers and volunteers therefore emigrated, especially to Italy and to France. Eventually, the Agency was successful <b>in</b> <b>convincing</b> the French government (the Directory) to organize a Polish military unit. As the French Constitution did not allow for the employment of foreign troops on French soil, the French decided to use the Poles to bolster their allies in Italy, the Cisalpine Republic.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{had been}} the {{agreement}} before the war that Ernest would stay and manage Paterson, Laing and Bruce while his brothers were serving, Ernest Bruce decided to enlist in the British Army in 1915. Hence, in September 1916 Bruce sought to resign his commission and return to Australia to resume management of the family business. The War Office refused his request but granted him leave to return to Australia while recuperating from his injuries. As a decorated soldier on crutches with a gift for public speaking, he was enlisted to become a spokesperson for government recruitment in Australia. His success and popularity in this role brought the attention of the Nationalist League and then Prime Minister Billy Hughes, who lobbied the British government on his behalf and succeeded <b>in</b> <b>convincing</b> the War Office to allow Bruce to relinquish his commission in June 1917.|$|E
5|$|Although {{military}} {{reform was}} delayed {{until the end}} of his reign, Leopold did succeed <b>in</b> <b>convincing</b> parliament of the need to extend Belgium's defenses. Construction of fortresses along the border by both the French and Germans in the mid-1880s worried the Belgian government that their country might be used as an invasion route. In 1887, a program of fortification construction began along the Sambre and Meuse rivers. Designed by the leading military architect Henri Alexis Brialmont, nine forts were built at Namur to guard against an offensive from France, while twelve were built around Liège, near the German border. Completed in 1892, they supplemented the existing National Redoubt at Antwerp, which was later modernized and extended. The fortifications would {{play a major role in}} the opening stages of the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Gauri {{tried for}} several weeks to persuade Chrisye to commit to the concert, and {{following}} Chrisye's introduction to Erwin Gutawa, who was scheduled to handle the arrangements, Jay Subyakto succeeded <b>in</b> <b>convincing</b> him {{that it might be}} the last chance to revive his career. Lacking the necessary funding, they approached RCTI in search of sponsorship but were refused, and laughingly told that they should try holding a concert at the National Monument. Undeterred, Chrisye, Subaktyo, and Gutawa put together a group of artists and began rehearsals. Around the time of RCTI's fourth anniversary, the television station relented and agreed to fund the concert as part of their celebrations; the thousands of tickets available sold out within a week.|$|E

5|$|Lacker was {{instrumental}} <b>in</b> <b>convincing</b> Presley to record with Memphis producer Chips Moman and his handpicked musicians at American Sound Studio in early 1969. The American Sound sessions represented a significant {{departure from the}} control customarily exerted by Hill and Range. Moman still {{had to deal with the}} publisher's staff on site, whose song suggestions he regarded as unacceptable. He was on the verge of quitting, until Presley ordered the Hill and Range personnel out of the studio. Although RCA executive Joan Deary was later full of praise for the producer's song choices and the quality of the recordings, Moman, to his fury, received neither credit on the records nor royalties for his work.|$|E
5|$|Many princes {{were also}} {{pressured}} by popular sentiment favouring integration with India, which meant {{their plans for}} independence had little support from their subjects. The Maharaja of Travancore, for example, definitively abandoned his plans for independence after the attempted assassination of his dewan, Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer. In a few states, the chief ministers or dewans {{played a significant role}} <b>in</b> <b>convincing</b> the princes to accede to India. The key factors that led the states to accept integration into India were, however, the efforts of Lord Mountbatten, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and V. P. Menon. The latter two were respectively the political and administrative heads of the States Department, which was in charge of relations with the princely states.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the animal keepers were issued with rifles to deal with any dangerous animals who might escape if the gardens were bombed. A night shift was introduced to watch over the animals 24hours a day. A list of dangerous animals that was drawn up included 13lions, 6tigers, 2leopards, 1cheetah, 2tigons, 3other small cats and several bears. Although the zoo's administrators succeeded <b>in</b> <b>convincing</b> the local authorities that any danger from the animals was minimal, primarily because the perimeter walls were so high, the keepers were replaced in their sharp-shooting role by soldiers who patrolled the grounds armed with tommy guns.|$|E
