25|$|Arnold's Wildcats were {{a highly}} {{successful}} team, as they finished the regular season as minor premiers with a 22–4 record. After another successful regular season, the Wildcats entered the finals brimming with confidence. The Wildcats easily accounted for long-term rivals the Adelaide 36ers in the Semi Finals to then find themselves against the highly-rated Eastside Spectres in the Grand Final. The Wildcats had {{a unique opportunity to}} win back-to-back titles, a feat only achieved by two other teams to that point {{in the history of the}} NBL. <b>Everything</b> <b>looked</b> on track when the Wildcats were able to defeat the Spectres in Game 1 in Melbourne by 26 points (109–83). Perth had hit fever pitch and another sold-out crowd awaited the Wildcats for Game 2 back at home. However, with their backs against the wall, the Spectres performed with a never-say-die attitude and upset the favourites at home by five points (86–81). Game 2 was played on a Friday night and Game 3 was scheduled for Sunday, leaving the Wildcats little time to formulate a new strategy. However, in front of an electric Perth crowd, the Wildcats were victorious in the deciding third game by 10 points (90–80) and became the third team in history to win back-to-back NBL Championships. Hansen was named MVP of the Grand Final series after averaging 17.3 points per game over the three games.|$|E

I was there for awhile, and at that moment in time, when you finally get picked after waiting for 4 1/2 hours, the last thought in my head was spit out your gum, fix your hair or make sure your shirt and <b>everything</b> <b>looked</b> good. I was just trying to get on stage as fast as possible and get that Browns jersey in my hand." ...|$|E
