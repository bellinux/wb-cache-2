5|$|Historically, {{this was}} not the case. For most of its history, ain't was {{acceptable}} across many social and regional contexts. Throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, ain't and its predecessors were part of normal usage for both <b>educated</b> <b>and</b> uneducated English speakers, and was found in the correspondence and fiction of, among others, Jonathan Swift, Lord Byron, Henry Fielding, and George Eliot. For Victorian English novelists William Makepeace Thackeray and Anthony Trollope, the <b>educated</b> <b>and</b> upper classes in 19th century England could use ain't freely, but in familiar speech only. Ain't continued to be used without restraint by many upper middle class speakers in southern England into the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|During the 11th century, {{political}} rivalries divided {{members of}} the court due to the ministers' differing approaches, opinions, and policies regarding the handling of the Song's complex society and thriving economy. The idealist Chancellor, Fan Zhongyan (989–1052), was the first to receive a heated political backlash when he attempted to institute the Qingli Reforms, which included measures such as improving the recruitment system of officials, increasing the salaries for minor officials, and establishing sponsorship programs to allow a wider range of people to be well <b>educated</b> <b>and</b> eligible for state service.|$|E
5|$|Highly <b>educated</b> <b>and</b> {{a patron}} of the arts, Honoré II, secure on his throne, began {{collecting}} works by Titian, Dürer, Raphael, Rubens and Michelangelo which {{formed the basis of}} the art collection that furnished the palace slowly evolving from the Monaco fortress. Over the following 30-year period he transformed it into a palace suitable for a prince (Illustration 9).|$|E
5|$|His {{position}} in the firm was sufficiently elevated that he received business correspondence at the factory; for example, a letter to Perrins survives from October 1791, when a John Stratford sought his advice. Perrins was <b>educated</b> <b>and</b> literate {{by the standards of}} his time, although economic historian Eric Robinson has said that all engine-erectors needed to be literate to understand fitting instructions sent to their work site by their employers.|$|E

5|$|I thus learnt {{my first}} great {{lesson in the}} inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the {{repeated}} observation of facts by other men, admittedly sane and honest. The whole history of science shows us that whenever the <b>educated</b> <b>and</b> scientific men of any age have denied the facts of other investigators on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility, the deniers have always been wrong.|$|E
5|$|Jan Zamoyski, one of {{the most}} {{distinguished}} personalities of the period, became the king's principal adviser and manager. A highly <b>educated</b> <b>and</b> cultivated individual, talented military chief and accomplished politician, he had often promoted himself as a tribune of his fellow szlachta. In fact in a typical magnate manner, Zamoyski accumulated multiple offices and royal land grants, removing himself far from the reform movement ideals he professed earlier.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, Hellenic Nomarchy {{points to}} the ongoing {{successful}} struggle of the Serbs against the Ottoman rule, which began in 1804. The author states that the Orthodox clergy was holding back the national aspirations of the Greek people, while the <b>educated</b> <b>and</b> dynamic elements of Greek society and the mercantile diaspora should return to Greece and join the movement of national liberation.|$|E

5|$|Rusli is Hasan's {{childhood}} friend who approaches him in Bandung. A Marxist-Leninist, he is highly <b>educated</b> <b>and</b> eloquent, which he often uses to win debates {{on the benefits}} of different ideologies. Through Rusli, Hasan is introduced to several other characters with Western educations and ideologies, including Hasan's future wife Kartini. During Hasan's time in Bandung, Rusli provides emotional support to him and Kartini. Rusli accompanies Kartini to the police station to identify Hasan's body.|$|E
5|$|The Boultons had two {{children}}, Matthew Robinson Boulton and Anne Boulton. Matthew Robinson in turn had {{six children}} with two wives. His eldest son Matthew Piers Watt Boulton, broadly <b>educated</b> <b>and</b> also {{a man of}} science, gained some fame posthumously for his invention of the important aeronautical flight control, the aileron. As his father before him, he also had two wives and six children.|$|E
5|$|The Cadet Nurses Corps was {{the largest}} of the federal nurse-training programs; it allowed young women to serve their country in uniform and without discrimination. It also {{influenced}} the way in which nurses would be <b>educated</b> <b>and</b> trained in the United States. The American Hospital Association credited the cadet student nurses with helping to prevent the collapse of civilian nursing care, and commended them for replacing graduate nurses who enlisted in the armed forces during World War II.|$|E

5|$|The {{details of}} Bede's story, and in {{particular}} of the miraculous nature of Cædmon's poetic inspiration, are not generally accepted by scholars as being entirely accurate, but there seems no good reason to doubt {{the existence of a}} poet named Cædmon. Bede's narrative has to be read {{in the context of the}} Christian belief in miracles, and it shows at the very least that Bede, an <b>educated</b> <b>and</b> intelligent man, believed Cædmon to be an important figure in the history of English intellectual and religious life.|$|E
5|$|The show of {{solidarity}} between the sisters {{did not last}} long. Mary, a devout Catholic, was determined to crush the Protestant faith in which Elizabeth had been <b>educated,</b> <b>and</b> she ordered that everyone attend Catholic Mass; Elizabeth had to outwardly conform. Mary's initial popularity ebbed away in 1554 when she announced plans to marry Prince Philip of Spain, the son of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and an active Catholic. Discontent spread rapidly through the country, and many looked to Elizabeth as a focus for their opposition to Mary's religious policies.|$|E
5|$|A {{school day}} at the orphanage would start at 6:00a.m. with many morning chores to be completed, predominately cleaning. A mass would be held at 7:15a.m., and breakfast would follow. Boys at the orphanage would then go to school. All boys over 14 were given a {{religious}} education at the Brother's Cathedral School, whereas the younger boys attended the infants' school at the Convent. All boys were also trained in technical education. Before leaving, the orphanage trained the boys in all classes of agriculture. This was so the boys were well <b>educated</b> <b>and</b> had the knowledge to become sufficient farmers {{when they left the}} orphanage.|$|E
