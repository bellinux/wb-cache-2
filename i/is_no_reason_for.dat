25|$|The Metaphysics (anachronistic Greek title: Θεοφράστου τῶν μετὰ τὰ φυσικά), in nine {{chapters}} (also {{known as}} On First Principles), {{was considered a}} fragment of a larger work by Usener in his edition (Theophrastos, Metaphysica, Bonn, 1890), but according to Ross and Fobes in their edition (Theophrastus, Metaphysica, Oxford, 1929), the treatise is complete (p.X) and this opinion is now widely accepted. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> assigning this work to some other author {{because it is not}} noticed in Hermippus and Andronicus, especially as Nicolaus of Damascus had already mentioned it.|$|E
25|$|This measure {{appeared}} as Measure 56, and would exempt elections held in May and November of any {{year from the}} double majority requirement. It was later passed by voters on November 4, 2008. Proponents of the measure called the double majority rule undemocratic because, in their view, the rule gave non-voters unfair influence in the democratic process {{by allowing them to}} make measures fail that otherwise won support among the majority of those who actually voted. They also argued that because of Oregon's exclusive vote-by-mail voting system, which makes it more convenient to vote, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> people not to vote.|$|E

25|$|The Blytt-Sernander {{classification}} {{has been}} used as a temporal framework for the archaeological cultures of Europe and America. Some have gone so far as to identify stages of technology in north Europe with specific periods; however, this approach is an oversimplification not generally accepted. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>for</b> example, why the north Europeans should stop using bronze and start using iron abruptly at the lower boundary of the Subatlantic at 600 BC. In the warm Atlantic period, Denmark was occupied by Mesolithic cultures, rather than Neolithic, notwithstanding the climatic evidence. Moreover, the technology stages vary widely globally.|$|E
25|$|In neoclassical {{economic}}s, {{economic growth}} is described with growth models (e.g., the Solow–Swan model) in terms of equilibrium ("steady state"). Input per worker and output per worker grow at the same rate. Therefore, capital intensity remains constant over time. At the same time, in equilibrium, {{the rate of growth}} of employment is constant over time. Translated into terms of labor theory of value, this means that the value composition of capital does not rise, and the constant rate of growth of employment also indicates, in terms of the labor theory of value, that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the rate of profit to decline.|$|E

However, Chen believes that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the company to commercially produce such games, as {{they would not be}} creating new ideas that justified the cost of remaining an independent studio, as opposed to working for existing game developers. Similarly, Chen does not intend for Thatgamecompany to make [...] "big budget blockbuster games", as he believes that the financial pressure would stifle innovation.|$|E

500|$|Some protesters {{resorted to}} illegal means to {{demonstrate}} {{their opposition to the}} project. In December 1989, trees and shrubbery on condemned lots were destroyed in an attempt to prevent them from being transplanted by landscapers. A field office belonging to M.J. Lee Construction Co., a contractor working on the project, was burglarized on March 4, 1990. The perpetrators stole or destroyed tools and poured oil on planning documents. A week later, the fuel lines on heavy equipment were slashed. On the night of April 26, several vehicles at a Creek Turnpike worksite belonging to M.J. Lee were vandalized; the vandals smashed windshields and headlights, stole fuel caps, and dumped mud into the fuel tanks. Messages reading [...] "Death to OTA", [...] "Death to [...] Bellmon" [...] and [...] "Death to Bartlett" [...] (who had recently also become a Tulsa city councilman) were written in mud {{on the side of a}} water truck at the site. The vice president of the firm emphasized that the company alone bore the brunt of the estimated $10,000 ($17,900 in [...] dollars) financial loss, not OTA, and offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to the prosecution of the responsible party. Construction signage was also removed or covered up with Tulsans Against Turnpikes signs, and survey markers were relocated. Tulsans Against Turnpikes publicly condemned the vandalism, offering an additional $500 reward for information. A member of the group's board stated [...] "We deplore this kind of cowardly, illegal action. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> some sick person to take out frustrations on the contractor." [...] In response to the vandalism, Tulsa police launched an investigation, and OTA stated that Oklahoma Highway Patrol officers would be on patrol in the construction areas. On August 11, 1990, a contractor arriving for work discovered a vandal attempting to break the window of a crane. As the employee approached the crane, four people fled the scene. The employee was able to detain two of them, both aged eighteen, until police arrived and cited them for misdemeanor malicious mischief.|$|E

2500|$|In Lecture II, Cherniss {{defended the}} {{consistency}} of the dialogues by arguing that Plato's supposed late development of a mathematical ontology is a misinterpretation imposed by Aristotle on material found in the dialogues: '… the theory of idea-numbers which Aristotle ascribes to Plato is just Aristotle's own interpretation of the necessary consequences [...] implied in the doctrine of the Platonic dialogues …' Thus there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>for</b> example, to see a critique of an 'early' Theory of Forms in the dialogues that was remedied by a later mathematical theory.|$|E
2500|$|A {{possible}} argument, {{which had}} not yet been posed to the Court, was that Article 93 of the Constitution, which vests the judicial power of Singapore in the Supreme Court, conferred on the Court of Appeal the power to reopen concluded appeals.

Several other complaints by Dr. Chopra that he was passed over for promotions because of his race were also dismissed. The Tribunal also ruled that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the Tribunal to conclude that systemic discrimination still exists at Health Canada and to order it to take additional measures to address general or systemic issues of discrimination." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{chairman}} of Chicago’s political science {{department at the}} time, Mearsheimer sat down with Noelle-Neumann to discuss the article and the allegations. After meeting with her for over three hours, Mearsheimer publicly declared, “I believe that Noelle-Neumann was an anti-Semite,” and he spearheaded a campaign asking her for an apology. [...] He joined other University of Chicago faculty in writing a joint piece for Commentary Magazine that reacted to Noelle-Neumann’s reply to the accusation against her. [...] They declared, “by providing rhetorical support for the exclusion of Jews, her words helped make the disreputable reputable, the indecent decent, the uncivilized civilized, and the unthinkable thinkable.” [...] Mearsheimer said [...] "Knowing {{what we know now}} about the Holocaust, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> her not to apologize.

[...] At the same time when the Old Guard was itself organizing itself as the Committee for the Preservation of the Socialist Party with an Executive Secretary, office, [...] "Provisional Executive Committee," [...] and mailing list, Oneal rather hysterically charged the RPC as being a [...] "party within the party" [...] and a [...] "dual organization in the party!" [...] "The RPC is Lovestone Communism," [...] Oneal declared, noting that [...] "the Lovestone organization is supporting the Communist elements in the Socialist Party."

2500|$|When Juliana {{announced}} her abdication on 31 January 1980, {{discussions on the}} form of government resurfaced in purple political circles, in which republican members, mainly from the youth wings, clashed with the royalist party boards. A motion by the Young Socialists, urging the PvdA to act on its goal of a republic {{as stated in the}} party platform, was rejected by the party council and thus not voted on. After a Young Liberals (JOVD) commission declared that an elected head of state would be 'desirable', the JOVD main board that the JOVD [...] "has no need for a different for of government" [...] at all, [...] "seeing the excellent manner in which queen Juliana has performed her work." [...] VVD chair Frits Korthals Altes said he regretted the JOVD commission's statement, arguing monarchism {{is not a matter of}} political opinion, but of 'being Dutch' (implying republicans are not Dutch), and moreover claiming: 'The bond between the House of Orange and the Netherlands is above any discussion.' In response to clamour for discussion on the most desirable form of government from D'66 members, D'66 parliamentary leader Jan Terlouw said discussion itself was good, but wondered [...] "whether striving towards the theoretically best is also the most desirable", concluding that as long as everything works alright, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> change.
