25|$|Regina and Emma {{are looking}} for Henry and Violet in Boston, but they have lost the tracker because as Henry left his phone on the bus, as he knew Emma placed the GPS tracker app on it. After she shows the lady the picture of Henry on her phone, Regina grabs Henry's phone and throws it in the trash. Suddenly, Regina's anger lights the trash on fire, and Emma makes <b>it</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> They also {{discover}} that magic can work outside of Storybrooke, as Henry has taken the crystal and the magic. Regina then uses a needle on Emma's bloody finger on the map where to find Henry and Violet, leading them to New York City.|$|E
25|$|The {{other major}} {{sticking}} point, which is reportedly causing concern at government level, {{is that the}} majority of people going to Potsdamer Platz are visitors to the city, implying that the original vision of the development as a linking element attracting Berliners themselves, and Berliners {{from both sides of the}} former divide, has not really materialised. There are criticisms that the development does not sit easily with or connect with its surroundings, and as a result Berliners have had difficulty accepting it as theirs (despite the fact that the choice of Hilmer & Sattler's masterplan was partly because it was the only one to address the way the development juxtaposed with the Cultural Forum immediately to the west, although the Cultural Forum has itself faced similar criticisms of its own). Another, more psychological factor that has played a part here is that a long-standing mutual distrust or antipathy felt between former East Berliners and West Berliners (Ossis and Wessis according to the well-known slang terms), is still very much in evidence in the city and elsewhere in Germany, and bold civil engineering projects and architectural statements are not going to make <b>it</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> by themselves. Politicians past and present have been accused of short-sightedness in speculating that they would.|$|E
500|$|Quatermass {{emerges from}} the car park to find the stadium empty. So many have now been {{harvested}} that the particles of dust in the air have turned the sky green. Kapp attempts to repair his equipment in order to contact the alien presence, but the Planet People destroy his efforts. They try {{to persuade him to}} join them but he refuses, convinced now that his family are dead. Quatermass, aided by Gurov, who has travelled to London from Moscow, assembles a team of scientists to find a solution. He deliberately selects old people for the task as they are immune to the effects of the alien force. Quatermass decides to set a trap. He plans to fake the presence of a large gathering of Planet People at Kapp's observatory and, when the force comes, to detonate a nuclear weapon. Quatermass does not believe this will be sufficient to destroy the alien machine but he hopes that it will damage it enough to make <b>it</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> Kapp volunteers to stay behind with Quatermass to help detonate the bomb. The pair set up the trap and wait. Suddenly, Kickalong appears with a group of Planet People, including Quatermass' granddaughter, Hettie. Kapp tries to warn them away but is shot by Kickalong. The light appears, indicating that the alien force has arrived, but the shock of seeing his granddaughter among the Planet People causes Quatermass to suffer a heart attack. However, aided by Hettie, he is able to detonate the bomb. Later, according to Gurov, [...] "The message was taken. It has not come again. We pray it will never come again".|$|E

Although he survives, a doctor later tells him he has little time to live. [...] As he is dying Asch gives Luke what remains of his power allowing him to perform Second Order hyperressonance.

And when you proposed that marriage by Cheditafa, he was very much troubled and annoyed. It was something so rough and jarring, and so discordant with what he had hoped, that at first he could not bear to think of it. But he afterwards saw the sense of your reasoning, and agreed simply because it would be to my advantage in case he should lose his life in his undertaking. And we will be married to-morrow at the embassy." ...|$|E
