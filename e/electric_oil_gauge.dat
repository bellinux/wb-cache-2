50|$|For 1977 models, power {{windows and}} power door locks were {{introduced}} as an optional extra. There was {{another round of}} new grilles, revised inner door panels that left less metal exposed, a four-wheel drive, full one-ton chassis {{was added to the}} lineup, and a Dana 60 was used for the front axle, as well as an <b>electric</b> <b>oil</b> pressure <b>gauge</b> replacing the mechanical unit. Trucks with an optional trim level, but without an additional wheel upgrade, received flatter stainless steel hubcaps, still with painted accents. This was also the only year with yellow painted trim instead of black.|$|R
5000|$|The 1941 Clipper was {{the widest}} {{production}} {{car in the}} industry and first to be wider than it was tall—a foot wider to be exact. The body from cowl to deck was {{a single piece of}} steel—largest in the industry, and the floor pan had only one welded seam from end to end. Single pieces of sheet metal comprised the rear quarters and hood. The hood could be lifted from either side of the car or removed entirely by throwing two levers. Instead of the traditional third side window, ventipanes were incorporated in the rear doors, providing controllable flow-through ventilation. The battery made its first move from under the seat to under the hood, where it stayed warmer and was more accessible. There was a [...] "Ventalarm" [...] whistle to warn when the tank was within a gallon of being full, and an accelerator-activated starter button, so the act of starting simultaneously set the automatic choke. Reithard's beautiful symmetrical dashboard contained a full ration of instruments, including an <b>electric</b> <b>oil</b> pressure <b>gauge</b> adapted from the One Sixty. Options included Packard's Electromatic clutch, which let the driver ignore the clutch pedal in ordinary driving; [...] "Aerodrive" [...] (overdrive); an effective auxiliary under-seat heater, leather upholstery, fender skirts, and, for $275, air conditioning—a Packard first, introduced on all eight-cylinder 1940 models.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{hydraulic}} efficiency, modern automatic transmissions tend to apply <b>electric</b> <b>oil</b> pump in their hydraulic system. The <b>electric</b> <b>oil</b> pump can support the mechanical oil pump for cooling, lubrication, and maintaining the line pressure at low engine speeds. In addition, the start–stop function can be realized {{by means of the}} <b>electric</b> <b>oil</b> pump; thus, the fuel consumption can be further reduced. This article proposes a method of applying two-pump system (one <b>electric</b> <b>oil</b> pump and one mechanical oil pump) in automatic transmissions based on the forward driving simulation. A mathematical model for calculating the transmission power loss is developed. The power loss transfers to heat which requires oil flow for cooling and lubrication. A leakage model is developed to calculate the leakage of the hydraulic system. In order to satisfy the flow requirement, a flow-based control strategy for the <b>electric</b> <b>oil</b> pump is developed. Simulation results of different driving cycles show that there is a best combination of the size of <b>electric</b> <b>oil</b> pump and the size of mechanical oil pump with respect to the optimal energy conservation. Besides, the two-pump system can also satisfy the requirement of the start–stop function. This research is extremely valuable for the forward design of a two-pump system in automatic transmissions with respect to energy conservation and start–stop function...|$|R

These are supplementary pumps and do not replace the main, mechanical, oil pump.|$|R

50|$|On December 12, 1974, Edson {{suffered}} {{a fire in}} the after fireroom while training with the USS Coral Sea.

50|$|This was {{the first}} American front-wheel drive car to be offered to the public, beating the Ruxton {{automobile}} by several months, in 1929. The brainchild of former Miller engineer Carl Van Ranst, its drive system borrowed from the Indianapolis 500-dominating racers, using the same de Dion layout and inboard brakes. This allowed it to be much lower than competing cars. Both stock cars and special bodies built on the Cord chassis by American and European coachbuilders won prizes in contests worldwide. The L-29 came with full instrumentation, including a temperature <b>gauge,</b> <b>oil</b> pressure <b>gauge,</b> and speedometer on the left with a gas <b>gauge,</b> <b>oil</b> level <b>gauge,</b> and Ammeter {{on the right of}} the steering wheel.|$|R

50|$|The car's {{switch and}} <b>oil</b> <b>gauge</b> are mounted below the petrol tank on the dash, where Phillimore {{considered}} they stood {{a good chance}} of getting severe kicks from passengers' feet. Prices were £240 or £250 for the chassis depending on wheelbase which may be 8 ft 3 in or 9 ft. The shorter body was priced at £55, the longer £65. Hood and screen were extra.|$|R
50|$|This was {{apparently}} the first demonstration of a monoplane to the U.S. government. On January 20, 1913 at Garden City, New York she attempted a women's altitude record, {{but had to}} return to ground when an <b>oil</b> <b>gauge</b> broke and <b>oil</b> obscured her vision. With increasing disapproval of women flying after the death of Harriet Quimby, and suffering financial difficulties, she gave up aviation soon after.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis article {{reports the}} simple one step {{process for the}} {{extraction}} of nanostructured metal oxides from the industrial waste (EOFD) for the realization of low cost solar applications. By hydrothermal technique with NaOH and H 2 SO 4, valuable metals were obtained {{in the form of}} metal oxides. The identification of compounds and structural characterization were carried out through XRD and SEM analysis. Thus the metal oxides derived could be helpful to reduce the burden on the environment from the <b>electric</b> <b>oil</b> furnace dust, increase the development of the source nano material and reduce the cost of raw materials for solar cell applications...|$|R
