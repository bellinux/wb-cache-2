The soil was incubated at 5 °C and 15 °C after adding 15 N and gross N fluxes were calculated using a numerical simulation model. The model was calibrated on microbial C and N, basal respiration, and KCl-extractable NH 4 +, NO 3 −, 15 NH 4 + and 15 NO 3 −. In the LF layer, increased temperature {{resulted in a}} faster turnover of all N pools. In both layers net N mineralization did not increase at elevated temperature because both gross NH 4 + mineralization and NH 4 + immobilization increased. In the <b>H</b> <b>layer,</b> however, both gross NH 4 + mineralization and NH 4 + immobilization were lower at 15 °C than at 5 °C and the model predicted a decrease in microbial turnover rate at higher temperature although measured microbial activity was higher. The decrease in gross N fluxes in spite of increased microbial activity in the <b>H</b> <b>layer</b> at elevated temperature may {{have been caused by}} uptake of organic N. The model predicted a decrease in pool size of labile organic matter and microbial biomass at elevated temperature whereas the amount of refractory organic matter increased. Temperature averaged microbial C/N ratio was 14. 7 in the LF layer suggesting a fungi-dominated decomposer community whereas it was 7. 3 in the <b>H</b> <b>layer,</b> probably due to predominance of bacteria. Respiration and microbial C were difficult to fit using the model if the microbial C/N ratio was kept constant with time.

The a-C:H layer was deposited by rf-PECVD from the discharge of pure methane (CH(4)) while the nanostructures were formed from the discharge of a mixture of methane (CH(4)) and nitrogen (N(2)). The deposition rate, surface morphology and chemical bonding properties of the a-C: H films coating were studied with respect to the deposition time. The effects of these properties on the growth of CN(x) nanostructures were analyzed. The FTIR results indicated that the structure of the a-C:H layer was similar regardless of the thickness of the carbon layer.

40|$|The {{passivation}} of the amorphous crystalline silicon heterojunction SHJ and {{the hole}} transport across the same are the dominating topics in this thesis. The different chapters focus on The influence of hydrogen on SHJ passivation and an alternative passivation process for surfaces with higher surface free energy, {{the application of}} anti reflection nanostructures and the current generation in these structures, {{the application of a}} novel liquid precursor for SHJ passivation, the investigation of its conversion process and the differences between the resulting layer and PECV deposited a Si <b>H</b> <b>layers,</b> the transport across the SHJ and its dependence on the valence band offset and the future research topics for silicon heterojunction solar cells. Chapter 4 comprised an investigation of a two step process for the fabrication of i a Si <b>H</b> passivation <b>layers</b> on non ideal c Si surfaces. The more common approach of directly depositing the best possible passivation layer in a single step is sensitive to surface properties, such as the higher surface free energy of the 100 surface, and results in higher defect densities at Si 100, or crystallographically undefined surfaces, than on Si 111. Using a two step approach allows to deposit structurally worse a Si <b>H</b> <b>layers</b> first. These layers are less likely to form epitaxial regions on surfaces with higher free surface energies. In a second step the layer is then exposed to a hydrogen plasma treatment, which allows to introduce additional hydrogen into the layer and reduce the structural disorder. The two step approach allows to form an epitaxy free and hydrogen rich interface at the SHJ. Chapter 5 describes the application of the aforementioned method to passivate nanotextured silicon surfaces with i a Si H. The technological question in this project was to enable epitaxy free i a Si H growth on the crystallographically undefined nanotexture and then apply a hydrogen plasma, which improves the structural quality of the layer, but does not induce crystallization. Additionally the nanotextured solar cells featured a low quantum efficiency at the shorter wavelengths of the visible spectrum. It was deduced from simulations that this low quantum efficiency is based on parasitic absorption in crystalline silicon and a follow up experiment with nanotextures of varied height enabled to show that this parasitic absorption happens inside the nanotexture. The work on liquid silicon precursors for SHJ passivation is another application for the hydrogen plasma developed in chapter 4. In contrast to the previous application, the structural quality of the as deposited a Si <b>H</b> <b>layers</b> was acceptable, as shown by photo electron spectroscopy measurements of the valence band. Amorphous silicon layers prepared from liquid precursors feature low hydrogen densities. Also, these layers tend to be macroscopically porous. Both issues can be solved by a HPT. In addition to achieving a well passivated SHJ with a liquid silicon precursor, the conversion of the liquid silicon precursor was investigated and the differences of these layers to PECV deposited material were discussed.
