5|$|Finally, Aristotle {{observed}} that the child does not take <b>just</b> <b>any</b> form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information. Aristotle makes clear that he sometimes intends this third sense by giving the analogy of a woodcarving. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); the tools and carving technique used to make it (its efficient cause); and the design laid out for it (its eidos or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a word is compounded of letters in a specific order.|$|E

25|$|Each curve may {{pass through}} itself during this motion, {{but the two}} curves must remain {{separated}} throughout.

25|$|Most of {{the early}} Shia {{differed}} only marginally from mainstream Sunnis in their views on political leadership, {{but it is possible}} in this sect to see a refinement of Shia doctrine. Early Sunnis traditionally held that the political leader must come from the tribe of Muhammad—namely, the Quraysh tribe. The Zaydis narrowed the political claims of Ali's supporters, claiming that not <b>just</b> <b>any</b> descendant of Ali would be eligible to lead the Muslim community (ummah) but only those males directly descended from Muhammad through the union of Ali and Fatimah. But during the Abbasid revolts, other Shia, who {{came to be known as}} Imamiyyah (followers of the Imams), followed the theological school of Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, himself the great great grandson of Muhammad's son-in-law Imam Ali. They asserted a more exalted religious role for Imams and insisted that, at any given time, whether in power or not, a single male descendant of Ali and Fatimah was the divinely appointed Imam and the sole authority, in his time, on all matters of faith and law. To those Shia, love of the imams and of their persecuted cause became as important as belief in God's oneness and the mission of Muhammad.|$|E

500|$|For centuries, {{the attempt}} to alter the {{succession}} was mostly seen as a one-man-plot by the Duke of Northumberland. Since the 1970s, however, many historians have attributed {{the inception of the}} [...] "devise" [...] and the insistence on its implementation to the king's initiative. Diarmaid MacCulloch has made out Edward's [...] "teenage dreams of founding an evangelical realm of Christ", while David Starkey has stated that [...] "Edward had a couple of co-operators, but the driving will was his". Among other members of the Privy Chamber, Northumberland's intimate Sir John Gates has been suspected of suggesting to Edward to change his devise so that Lady Jane Grey herself—not <b>just</b> <b>any</b> sons of hers—could inherit the Crown. Whatever the degree of his contribution, Edward was convinced that his word was law and fully endorsed disinheriting his half-sisters: [...] "barring Mary from the succession was a cause in which the young King believed." ...|$|E

500|$|Davis biographer Jack Chambers {{was more}} critical, finding the sound quality and Grossman's {{performance}} poor, {{especially on the}} first disc, where he indulged in a [...] "nervous downpour of notes that is narrow in range and unimaginative". In general, Chambers complained that the concert's largely improvised format was risky and inauspicious: [...] "It can inspire creative bridges and emotive playing melded into a spontaneous suite or degenerate into a babble of voices bogged down {{in search of the}} musical means to get from one theme to the next." [...] In Tingen's opinion, the quality of the mix was [...] "substandard" [...] and Grossman's solos sounded [...] "nervous and shrill", but he still recommended Black Beauty as [...] "a powerful document of an exciting phase in Miles's electric explorations, when the direction of his live performances was catching up with his studio explorations". Writing for Down Beat, John Corbett found the recording [...] "gritty" [...] but the grooves free and pure-sounding. Sputnikmusic's Hernan M. Campbell was more enthusiastic, deeming it [...] "the perfect live album for not <b>just</b> <b>any</b> fan of Miles Davis, but jazz fans in general".|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the male}} {{characters}} in the series are often seen wearing suits, which Maslansky was comfortable with after working as the costume designer on White Collar. Murdock's suits are differentiated more by texture than color, with a limited palette, given that the character cannot see what color his clothing is. Cox's size changed throughout the series {{as he continued to}} work out. For Murdock's sunglasses, Maslansky worked with series prop master Michael Jortner to make something that fit into the modern world, but paid homage to [...] "what was familiar to fans". Close to 100 different versions of the prop were created for Cox to try. For the women of the series, Maslansky looked to their backstories in the show, with Page having dreams and fantasies of a life in New York along the lines of Katharine Hepburn and Lauren Bacall, and dressing according to those thoughts ("retro, slim skirts, tighter fitting tops and slim dresses"), while Marianna coming into the series as a mysterious yet glamorous femme fatale, dressing in high-end, couture clothing; [...] "she needed to appeal to [...] He wouldn’t go for <b>just</b> <b>any</b> chick in a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt." ...|$|E

Variety gave a positive review, describing the film as an [...] "extremely violent and superbly made actioner demonstrates the tight grasp that director John Woo has on the crime meller genre". Kathleen Maher of The Austin Chronicle praised the film stating that it [...] "defies all categorization but demands comparisons, if only to prove that there's never been anything like this before." [...] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote a positive review, describing the film as [...] "like eating popcorn, but it's not <b>just</b> <b>any</b> old brand; it's escape-velocity popcorn, popcorn with a slurp of rocket fuel... ideas overreach themselves with such a virile swagger that they border on comedy. With excess like this you can't help but laugh. This is a rush of a movie". The Christian Science Monitor gave the film a mixed review, stating that [...] "This violent Hong Kong thriller has more psychological depth than most of its kind, but ultimately seems like a pointless exercise in style".|$|E

500|$|Declaring {{the song}} Gaga's [...] "most stirring" [...] release, Michelle Geslani from Consequence of Sound called the track: [...] "a {{sweeping}} and intensely powerful number— it's not <b>just</b> <b>any</b> ordinary pop song". Christopher Tapley from Variety praised both Gaga and Warren's songwriting, describing it as: [...] "something of an anthem for the cause... It {{is one of}} the strongest contenders in this year's race for best original song [...] But far more than that, it is a rally cry for a movement." [...] Lisa Wright wrote in NME that the song is: [...] "a somber piano ballad befitting of the topic with lyrics that depict the frustration of being told to pick yourself up and carry on by people who couldn't possibly understand your situation." [...] Idolator's Robbie Daw claimed that the [...] "powerful, unsettling" [...] visuals were complimented by a [...] "strong vocal performance" [...] from Gaga. Brittany Spanos from Rolling Stone called it an [...] "evocative track", which highlighted Gaga's vocals and believed it to be [...] "a perfect follow-up to [...] with Tony Bennett".

500|$|Rihanna's voice spans one-and-a-half octaves in [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", from F3 to C5, and her vocal has a [...] "silky", [...] "seductive" [...] tone. In the song's lyrics Rihanna yearns for her lover's attention, {{which makes}} her feel like the only girl in the world. The singer [...] "pours her heart out" [...] in the chorus: [...] "Want you {{to make me feel}} like I'm the only girl in the world/ Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love/ Like I'm the only one who knows your heart/ Only girl in the world." [...] According to Digital Spy writer Nick Levine, the chorus [...] "thumps like a rabbit having an epileptic fit." [...] Rihanna sings suggestively, [...] "Baby, I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keepin'/ You can come inside/ And when you enter, you ain't leavin'/ Be my {{prisoner}} for the night." [...] Fraser McAlpine of the BBC compared the song's message to that of the German fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel"; Rihanna is not willing to throw her hair out of the castle for <b>just</b> <b>any</b> man to come and satisfy her, [...] "particularly not someone who isn't prepared to make the climb up to her scarily high window." ...|$|E
500|$|Many live {{instruments}} were {{used during the}} album's production, especially violin. Milian named [...] "You Make Me Laugh" [...] {{one of her favorite}} songs on the album. It was the first song written by Milian for the album, and she worked with Bloodshy for the song's production. The album's second and final single, [...] "When You Look at Me", was written by Milian. Using her school days as the inspiration for the song, Milian said that [...] "when I was growing up, I found people were always trying to label me. The first day of school it would be like 'Here comes this girl all dressed up. She thinks she's all that' and they didn't even know me. The message behind 'When You Look At Me' is never judge a book by its cover." [...] Milian asked Ja Rule to appear on her album, however {{she did not want to}} put him [...] "on <b>just</b> <b>any</b> song", and wanted to make sure it was the right song for him. Milian hoped Ja Rule would appear on the track [...] "A Girl Like Me", but he ended up rapping on [...] "Get Away". Milian co-wrote the track [...] "Twitch" [...] with R singer Montell Jordan, which explains that men have a certain twitch of their shoulders whenever they tell lies.|$|E

500|$|In November 2007, the Anne Frank tree—by then {{infected}} with a fungal disease affecting the tree trunk—was {{scheduled to be}} cut down {{to prevent it from}} falling on the surrounding buildings. Dutch economist Arnold Heertje said about the tree: [...] "This is not <b>just</b> <b>any</b> tree. The Anne Frank tree is bound up with the persecution of the Jews." [...] The Tree Foundation, a group of tree conservationists, started a civil case to stop the felling of the horse chestnut, which received international media attention. A Dutch court ordered city officials and conservationists to explore alternatives and come to a solution. The parties built a steel construction that was expected to prolong the life of the tree up to 15 years. However, it was only three years later, on 23 August 2010, that gale-force winds blew down the tree. Eleven saplings from the tree were distributed to museums, schools, parks and Holocaust remembrance centres through a project led by the Anne Frank Center USA. The first sapling was planted in April 2013 at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. Saplings were also sent to a school in Little Rock, Arkansas that was the scene of a desegregation battle, Liberty Park (Manhattan), which honours victims of the September 11 attacks, and other sites in the United States. Another horse chestnut tree honoring Frank was planted in 2010 at Kelly Ingram Park in Birmingham, Alabama.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} {{possible}} hints {{made in the}} season two finale towards an adaptation of Secret Warriors, Bell noted that the series does share the character Daisy Johnson with that comic, and [...] "the idea {{of a team of}} powered people is something we've seen in the show ... I think there's a world down the road where we do our version." [...] Elaborating on this and the series dealing with the many powered people introduced in season two, Bell said, [...] "People seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not going to take over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we really enjoy that. The fact that Inhumans are now out there is something I think we need to investigate". He later clarified that characters would not have to be Inhuman to join the Secret Warriors, just powered, and that not <b>just</b> <b>any</b> powered character would be allowed to join, given that Johnson had to go through years of training on top of getting powers to join the team, and so similar rules would apply to other potential members. Executive producers Maurissa Tancharoen and Jed Whedon also discussed the Secret Warriors, the former cautioning [...] "a very slow build" [...] to the team, and the latter explaining, [...] "We feel a duty to the Cinematic Universe to not hyper-accelerate how many people have powers ... We don't want it to be there's a thousand people with powers with a show that at its heart is about what it's like to not have powers in a world with powers." ...|$|E
