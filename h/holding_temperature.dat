This work evaluates the potential of the focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM), an in situ granulometric method, and of an in-house developed tube viscometer, to perform in situ characterization of a WP aggregation process. Potential of turbidity techniques to characterize the process was also explored by off-line measurements.

In {{order to}} produce a high quality and cost {{effective}} part in the rheocasting process for an automobile industry it has been important to develop a slurry-on-demand process, which can manufacture the semi-solid slurry having a fine and globular structure of primary solid phase. The morphology of primary solid phase of semi-solid slurry is coarsened and globularized during an isothermal holding process in a solid-liquid region. Accordingly, in this paper, the microstructural evolution of semi-solid slurry during the isothermal holding at a various temperature in solid-liquid region was investigated to examine a coarsening and globularization behavior of primary solid phase. The semi-solid slurry of Al alloy was produced in a slurry maker using a multiplex-type slurry cup that we developed recently. A size of primary solid phase was the finer at the higher <b>holding</b> <b>temperature,</b> but under a constant holding time a roundness degree of primary solid phase was the lower at the lower <b>holding</b> <b>temperature.</b> Also, a coarsening rate of primary solid phase was {{not considered to be}} affected significantly by a <b>holding</b> <b>temperature</b> even though a little lower coarsening rate was obtained at the higher <b>holding</b> <b>temperature...</b>|$|E

In this study, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to characterize the binding of sodium taurocholate (NaTC) to a cationic biopolymer (chitosan). The influence of ionic strength (0 – 150 mM NaCl) and temperature (10 – 40 °C) on the binding interactions was examined (pH 3, acetate buffer). At 30 °C, NaTC bound strongly to chitosan to form an insoluble complex that contained about 4 × 10 − 3 mol of NaTC per 1 g of chitosan at saturation. The presence of salt (0 – 150 mM NaCl, pH 3) decreased the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of NaTC (in both the absence and presence of chitosan), increased the minimum NaTC concentration required for binding to be observed, but had little influence {{on the amount of}} NaTC bound to chitosan at saturation. The enthalpy changes associated with micelle dissociation went from exothermic at low-holding temperatures (10 °C) to endothermic at higher <b>holding</b> <b>temperatures</b> (40 °C). Conversely, the enthalpy changes associated with NaTC–chitosan binding went from endothermic at low-holding temperatures (10 °C) to exothermic at higher <b>holding</b> <b>temperatures</b> (40 °C).
