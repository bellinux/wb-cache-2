40|$|On July 21, 2010, President Barack Obama {{signed the}} Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (The Act), which was {{developed}} by Congress {{in response to the}} financial crisis of 2008. In this paper we briefly discuss the history of U. S. financial regulation, the events leading up to the Dodd-Frank Act, and the intent of the new regulation. We note key events and industry types that contributed to the financial collapse of 2008. We also identify the provisions within the Act that will impact private and publically traded real estate <b>investment</b> <b>entities</b> and analyze the extent of any such impact. The hypothesis of this paper is that certain real estate <b>investment</b> <b>entities</b> are not systemic to the U. S. financial system and if new regulation designed to reform Wall Street and protect consumers is placing a significant burden on these firms without accomplishing the goals of the Act, then real estate <b>investment</b> <b>entities</b> should not be subject to such regulation. The analytic approach of this paper is to: 1) identify the provisions within the Act that will impact real estate equity entities (i. e., private real estate private funds and REITs), 2) conduct industry interviews to identify the likely short-term magnitude of the impacts due to new regulation and, 3) offer a conclusion as to whether the Act will have a substantial negative effect on the industry. In conclusion, with respect to these <b>investment</b> <b>entities,</b> we found that the Dodd-Frank Act has improved transparency to investors through increased disclosures. However, the allencompassing nature of the Act has forced fund managers who were previously exempt from SEC registration to comply with securities regulations regardless of the systemic nature, or lack thereof, of their business practices. While such compliance will not have a substantial negative effect on the industry, we find that the regulation of private real estate funds does not help further the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act. by Michael DiMinico and John Edward Lubitz.

40|$|Using {{quantile}} regression, {{this article}} examines default risk of emerging and speculative companies in Australia and the United States as compared to established and <b>investment</b> <b>entities.</b> We use two datasets {{for each of the}} two countries, one speculative and one established. In the US we compare companies from the S 2 ̆ 6 P 500 to those on the Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings list (Moody 2 ̆ 7 s Investor Services, 2010). For Australia, we compare entities from the S 2 ̆ 6 P/ASX 200 to those on the S 2 ̆ 6 P/ASX Emerging Companies Index (EMCOX). We also divide the datasets into GFC and Pre-GFC periods to examine default risk over different economic circumstances. Quantile Regression splits the data into parts or quantiles, thus allowing default risk to be examined at different risk levels. This is especially useful in measuring extreme risk quantiles, when corporate failures are most likely. We apply Monte Carlo simulation to asset returns to calculate Distance to Default using a Merton structural credit model approach. In both countries, the analysis finds substantially higher default risk for speculative as compared to established companies. The spread between speculative company and established company default risk is found to remain constant in Australia through different economic circumstances, but to increase in the US during the GFC as compared to pre-GFC. These findings are important to lenders in understanding, and providing for, default risk for companies of different grades through varying economic cycles...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD {{thesis is}} to analyze the history and current {{situation}} of hedge funds and assess their potential to destabilize financial markets. The findings of the analysis are used to validate the assumptions underlying the major regulatory changes of hedge funds in the key global economic centres after the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. Since their inception early last century hedge funds have gone {{through a period of}} great expansion in the sixties, followed by a decline due to large losses sustained in the early seventies. The nineties meant a real breakthrough for hedge funds as a result of which they became prominent players in the alternative investment space. As of today, there is over ten thousand hedge funds that globally manage close to 3 trillion US dollars. Compared to mutual funds and other financial institutions the volume of assets under management is still relatively small, the rate of growth over the past fifteen years has however been very significant. What is emphasized with respect to the impact of hedge funds on financial markets is the contribution to increasing the liquidity and efficiency and their role on the financial derivatives market where hedge funds are actively involved in the transfer of risk. They are at the same time subject of criticism for their purported destabilizing effect on financial markets and contribution to fluctuations in the prices of investment instruments. Although the share of hedge funds in triggering major financial crises has not been conclusively established, these <b>investment</b> <b>entities</b> were one of the targets of the wide-ranging regulatory changes following the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. The dissertation first discusses the history and current situation of hedge funds and defines the term hedge fund. The following section describes the basic characteristics and principles of their functioning and reviews the regulation in the major domiciles. The final chapter is focused on the empirical analysis of the impact of hedge funds on financial markets. The inputs for this analysis include a global hedge fund index and representative market indices and data from the CFTC on positions in the 10 year US government treasury note futures. In the first step the descriptive statistics for the transformed time series are presented. The second part of the analysis focuses on lagged correlations between returns and volatility of the global hedge fund index and representative market indices. Granger causality tests are applied in the following section to determine the relationships between the returns and volatility of hedge fund and representative market indices. In the final step of the analysis Granger causality tests are used to analyze the link between the changes in positions in the 10 -year US treasury note futures held by hedge funds and the change in settlement prices of these futures with the aim to assess whether hedge funds have the capacity to move the market. In conclusion, the results of this analysis are discussed in light of the recent regulatory changes and the potential for the future growth of hedge funds is assessed...|$|E
40|$|Hedge {{funds are}} our modern titans of industry, and like their {{predecessors}} they now represent {{the best and}} the worst of the new global economy. These minimally regulated <b>investment</b> <b>entities</b> —in which historically only super-rich investors could have an interest —have recently had profound impacts on financial markets around the world. In early 1992, for example, George Soros, the now-famous hedge fund manager, made it big by using his hedge fund, Soros Fund Management LLC, to leverage a massive bet that the British pound would be ejected from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. The bet reportedly earned Mr. Soros over a billion dollars and the title of “the man who broke the Bank of England. ” A few years later, after another huge currency bet, the Malaysian Prime Minister accused Mr. Soros of bringing down the Malaysian currency. In the summer of 1998, Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), an extremely over-leveraged hedge fund, burst onto the public scene after its bets turned sour, nearly causing a catastrophic collapse of the world banking system. LTCM used approximately $ 2. 2 billion in investors’ funds to leverage approximately $ 125 billion worth of borrowed money, which LTCM further leveraged into $ 1. 25 trillion in open trading positions. The U. S. Treasury Department came to the rescue when these positions turned against LTCM and arranged a buyout of LTCM’s defaulted positions. In September 2006, Amaranth Advisers, another highly leveraged hedge fund, lost roughly $ 5 billion in value in a week when it lost its bets on the natural-gas market. Further, in the first two months of 2007, Red Kite Management’s hedge fund lost nearly twenty percent of its $ 1 billion metals-trading investments when its bets that copper and zinc futures would rise met sharply declining spot prices. The above incidents all involved hedge funds engaging in legal activities. However, many recent events have exposed the hedge fund industry as one wrought with illegality. For example, in 2003, a number of hedge funds were implicated in the mutual fund market-timing scandal that rocked Wall Street. Within the last couple of years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has investigated instances of insider trading by numerous hedge funds, including one of the nation’s most prominent funds, Pequot Capital Management. And in early March 2007, the SEC brought one of the largest insider-trading actions since the mid- 1980 s, and the individuals charged included several hedge fund employees. These examples are just a small sampling of the numerous instances in which hedge funds have had potentially disastrous effects on the market, pushed the limits of legal activities, or become entangled in criminal activities. But most worrisome is unsophisticated investors’ new found access to hedge funds through endowments, pensions, and other charitable entities, funds of hedge funds (FOHFs), and publicly traded shares of hedge fund management companies. Against this backdrop of illegality, the D. C. Circuit, in Goldstein v. SEC, vacated an SEC rule intended to protect investors from hedge fund abuses. This rule, the “Hedge Fund Rule,” would have allowed the SEC to gather vital information about the secret and elusive world of hedge funds. Unfortunately, the Goldstein court’s unsound and narrow reasoning serves as a prime example {{of the extent to which}} the current regulatory regime has ignored the fundamental motivations of our securities laws. This Note argues that the current judicial and regulatory stances on hedge funds fail to appreciate and account for the tremendous dangers that hedge funds pose not only to the security of our financial markets but also to the individual investors that securities regulations are designed to protect. To appreciate fully these failures, it is necessary to understand better the history of hedge funds and their recent explosion in popularity and in market power. To aid in this understanding, Part II of this Note discusses the four principal acts that regulate the securities markets and how hedge funds exist and function outside those regulations. Part III analyzes the Goldstein decision and explains the administrative law and normative failures of the court’s analysis. In Part IV, this Note discusses the unsatisfactory reactions to Goldstein and offers a few modest proposals to address the dangers that hedge funds pose. Part V concludes...|$|E
40|$|In my pro gradu thesis, I {{introduce}} the applicable principles of automatic exchange of account information in international tax {{matters in the}} context of the United States’ Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, regulation and contrast this with the OECD's Global Forum drafted Common Reporting Standard, or CRS. The recently implemented policies require that certain actors in the financial sector, such as banks and <b>investment</b> <b>entities</b> report their foreign clients and their account information to their respective tax residence jurisdictions, and with FATCA that they report to the United States of America. I describe some of the practical application problems, that these requirements regarding financial account information may cause in the private sector and at the administrative level, especially with respect to these two different automatic exchange of financial account information systems, FATCA and CRS. I focus on the differences between these two systems by comparing them to one another. The chosen perspective is global compliance and application, instead of any particular jurisdiction applying FATCA and/or CRS. I use certain jurisdictions as examples of the treaty implementation to further demonstrate the differences between the two systems. The main research method is a fiscal policy approach with a socio-economic focus as well as some methods of comparative law. The key sources are the applicable treaties and the material containing the detailed rules for the application of the systems. As additional source material I also use academic articles and government announcements, which specify the interpretation of the applicable rules. I approach the subject by dividing the pro gradu thesis into chapters that cover the principle of automatic exchange of information or AEoI focusing on the financial account information exchange in the two major applicable treaties. The main chapters of this thesis {{introduce the}} implemented practices from these agreements by emphasizing their significant differences and their possible effects in practice. In the early chapters, I briefly introduce the EU legislation about AEoI as a reference point. The first chapter of this thesis introduces the scope of the topic of AEoI and the interdisciplinary connections to other fields of international tax law. I give some background information about the history of AEoI legislation process and explain the international public pressure for the agreements. The next chapter briefly describes the legislation process of FATCA and the overall system of AEoI in FATCA. Later, I examine the specifics of the agreement focusing on the obligated parties and financial accounts. The second main chapter is a similar description of the multilateral CRS and its background. This leads to the main chapter of this thesis and the further analysis of the research question: What are the main differences between FATCA and the CRS and how will the differences affect the practical applicability of the principle of AEoI for financial accounts in tax matters? The final chapter binds together specific differences between of the application of the automatic exchange of financial account information principles based on the treaties and introduced academic material as well as speculation about the future of AEoI in the light of these agreements and their differences reflecting on global fiscal policy. Finally, I summarize my arguments in the Conclusion chapter. From the technical perspective, the most significant areas of divergence include the option to use account balance de minimis thresholds for identification and reporting purposes to exclude or lighten the due diligence requirements of the financial institutions under FATCA but not under CRS. This has led to implementation, cost and system design issues for many jurisdictions. The treaties have a large amount of very specific definitions, which are used for the implementation of the AEoI, some of these terms do not correspond to one another in the two systems. CRS relies primarily on domestic legislation and practices, whereas FATCA refers mostly to US policy. Additionally, FATCA has a broader set of excluded accounts compared to CRS. Finally, one of the most important differences is the extent of reciprocity in the automatic exchange of financial account information between FATCA and the CRS. FATCA is not truly reciprocal but has a strong economic incentive for compliance. CRS, on the other hand, is truly reciprocal, but lacks efficient compliance incentives and enforcement of sanctions. Neither of the systems do a very good job of regulating trusts and seem to leave them outside of the general reporting requirements, if they are carefully set up in a way to circumvent both systems...|$|E
