5|$|According to {{historian}} David Armitage, the Declaration of Independence did {{prove to}} be internationally influential, but not as a statement of human rights. Armitage argued that the Declaration {{was the first in}} a new genre of <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> independence that announced the creation of new states.|$|E
5|$|Examples of {{important}} inscriptions {{of this nature}} include treaties with local tribes and <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> rights. The text of this inscription cannot be reconstructed from this small fragment, but it appears {{to talk about the}} 'fortress', an 'amicable conclusion', and someone being 'against the regime'.|$|E
5|$|Regarding {{matters of}} foreign policy, the Constitution (under Article102) {{required}} that the General Assembly be consulted about <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> war, treaties and the conduct of international relations. A determined legislator could exploit these Constitutional provisions to block or limit government decisions, influence appointments and force reconsideration of policies.|$|E
50|$|While {{there were}} no {{immediate}} effects in the United States upon publishing <b>of</b> the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> the Rights of Woman, it was used extensively in the modeling <b>of</b> the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Sentiments, written by Elizabeth Cady Stanton {{and others at the}} Seneca Falls Convention, held in the summer <b>of</b> 1848. The <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Sentiments, much like the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> the Rights of Woman was written in the style <b>of</b> the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> the Rights of Man, was written in the style <b>of</b> the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence of the United States.|$|R

5|$|According to the British Museum, the Cyrus Cylinder {{reflects}} {{a long tradition}} in Mesopotamia where, from {{as early as the}} third millennium BC, kings began their reigns with <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> reforms. Cyrus's declaration stresses his legitimacy as the king, and is a conspicuous statement of his respect for the religious and political traditions of Babylon. The British Museum and scholars of the period describe it as an instrument of ancient Mesopotamian propaganda.|$|E
5|$|At {{both the}} 1999 and 2005 presidential elections, S. R. Nathan {{was elected by}} default as the only {{eligible}} candidate on nomination day. While {{being a member of}} a minority community worked to his advantage, he was unanimously endorsed by the 1999 Cabinet because of the merit of his overall qualities. Similarly, Nathan's decision to run for a second term in 2005 was accompanied by <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> support from Government ministers and organizations like the NTUC.|$|E
50|$|When a regent {{is removed}} from office by a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> {{incapacity}} and subsequently the incapacity ceases to exist, the regent can be restored to office by means <b>of</b> a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> cessation of incapacity. In that case upon the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> cessation of incapacity, a change of regent takes place, with {{the person who has}} a lower place in the order of succession ceasing to be the regent, and in his or her stead the person with a higher position in the order of succession, who had only ceased to be regent due to the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> incapacity, resuming the office of regent. The requirements for <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> cessation of incapacity regarding the regent are the same ones that are valid for a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> cessation of incapacity regarding the sovereign.|$|R

5|$|In April 1943, the Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, {{was invited}} by Berger {{to assist in}} organising and {{recruiting}} Muslims into the Waffen-SS and other units. He was escorted by von Krempler, who spoke Turkish. The Mufti successfully convinced the Muslims to ignore the <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> the Sarajevo, Mostar and Banja Luka Ulama (Islamic clerics), who in 1941 forbade them from collaborating with the Ustaše.|$|E
5|$|Other French {{leaders were}} {{directly}} {{influenced by the}} text of the Declaration of Independence itself. The Manifesto of the Province of Flanders (1790) was the first foreign derivation of the Declaration; others include the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence (1811), the Liberian Declaration of Independence (1847), the <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> secession by the Confederate States of America (1860–61), and the Vietnamese Proclamation of Independence (1945). These declarations echoed the United States Declaration of Independence in announcing the independence of a new state, without necessarily endorsing the political philosophy of the original.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. Declaration of Independence {{inspired}} {{many other}} similar documents in other countries, the first being the 1789 Declaration of Flanders issued during the Brabant Revolution in the Austrian Netherlands (modern-day Belgium).

5|$|Despite U.S. <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> {{neutrality}} and German {{accountability for}} its unrestricted submarine warfare, in 1915 the British passenger liner Lusitania was sunk, leading {{to calls for}} war. President Wilson forced the Germans to suspend unrestricted submarine warfare and after long debate Congress passes the Naval Act of 1916 that authorized a $500million construction program over three years for 10 battleships, 6 battlecruisers, 10 scout cruisers, 50 destroyers and 67 submarines. The idea was a balanced fleet, but in the event destroyers were much more important, {{because they had to}} handle submarines and convoys. By {{the end of the war}} 273 destroyers had been ordered; most were finished after World War I ended but many served in World War II. There were few war plans beyond the defense of the main American harbors.|$|E

(D'Agostino and Bontate were killed by Riina’s Corleonesi in the Second Mafia War; Badalamenti died in a US prison in April 2004.)

5|$|In August 1990, an {{insurgency}} {{known as the}} Log Revolution took place in Croatia. It centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around the city of Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, and Banovina regions, and settlements in eastern Croatia with significant Serb populations. These areas were subsequently declared to be the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK). After the RSK declared its intention to join Serbia, the Government of Croatia declared the RSK a rebel organization. By March 1991, the conflict had escalated, resulting in the Croatian War of Independence. In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated. A three-month moratorium on the <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> independence by Croatia and the RSK followed, but both declarations came into effect on 8 October.|$|E
5|$|On 29 June, Croatia and Slovenia {{agreed to}} suspend their <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> {{independence}} to allow {{time for a}} negotiated settlement. The EC delegation appeared to make progress when Serbia responded to the move by ceasing {{their opposition to the}} appointment of a Croatian member of the federal presidency, Stjepan Mesić, as the body's chairman on 30 June. The appearance of a success was reinforced when the JNA ordered its troops posted in Slovenia to return to their barracks. On 1 July, de Michelis was replaced by João de Deus Pinheiro, the Portuguese foreign minister, to maintain the formula of current, former and future EC presidencies comprising the EC delegation as the Netherlands took over the presidency from Luxembourg, while Portugal was scheduled to assume the presidency after the Dutch.|$|E
5|$|Public {{holidays}} in Rhodesia, {{a historical}} region in southern Africa equivalent to today's Zimbabwe and Zambia—formerly Southern and Northern Rhodesia, respectively—were largely based around milestones in the region's short history. Annual holidays marked {{various aspects of}} the arrival of white people during the 1880s and 1890s, as well as the respective unilateral <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> independence (1965) and of republican government (1970). On these days, most businesses and non-essential services closed. A number of Christian holidays were also observed according to custom, in the traditional British manner, and referred to in official documents by name—Christmas Day, for example, or Easter Monday.|$|E

5|$|The Cylinder {{itself is}} part of a {{continuous}} Mesopotamian tradition of depositing a wide variety of symbolic items, including animal sacrifices, stone tablets, terracotta cones, cylinders and figures.

Some contained messages, while others did not, and they had a number of purposes: elaboration of a building's value, commemoration of the ruler or builder and the magical sanctification of the building, through the invocation of divine protection.|$|E
