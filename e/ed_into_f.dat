40|$|This work {{analyses}} how European Dimension {{is implemented}} into the education {{systems of the}} Czech Republic, Germany (with {{the focus on the}} Free State of Saxony) and Poland. By means of empirical research it focuses on the identification, analysis and comparison of pupils' understanding and attachment of/to Europe, and attitudes and knowledge of pupils towards/about their neighbours from the Euroregion Nisa. The work is structured into 4 chapters. First of all the context for European Dimension in education is introduced. Understandings of various meanings of Europe, the influence of European integrative processes and the rapid changes that have been initiated by globalisation are introduced. The second chapter analyses the rhetorical curriculum of the implementation of the ED on the European level. Further an analysis of the education systems of the Czech Republic, Germany (with focus on the Free State of Saxony) and Poland was carried out including the analysis of implementation of the <b>ED</b> <b>into</b> these education systems from 1989 up to 2009. In order to create a complex overview of implementation of <b>ED</b> <b>into</b> these 3 education systems, a comparison of the implementation of ED was done among these 3 states. The theoretical part is finished by an analysis of approaches used for the implementation of the <b>ED</b> <b>into</b> [...] ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{provide the}} {{evidence}} of predicting and preventing the postoperative recurrence by investigating {{the relationship between the}} recurring types of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) aft er radical resection and clinicopathologic factors. METHODS Data from 464 CRC patients in stage I-III, who were admitted to our hospital during a period from January 1998 to December 2002 and underwent radical surgery, were collected, and retrospective analysis of the clinicopathologic data from 90 out of the 464 CRC patients, who developed postoperative recurrence was conducted. The 90 patients were divided into 2 groups based on the recurrence time (RT). Those with a RT of ≤ 30 months were classifi <b>ed</b> <b>into</b> the early recurrence (ER) group and those with RT of> 30 months were classifi <b>ed</b> <b>into</b> late recurrence (LR) group.
