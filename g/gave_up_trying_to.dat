25|$|The New Deal tried public works, farm subsidies, {{and other}} devices to reduce unemployment, but Roosevelt never {{completely}} <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> balance the budget. Between 1933 and 1941 the average federal budget deficit was 3% per year. Roosevelt did not fully utilize deficit spending. The effects of federal public works spending were largely offset by Herbert Hoover's large tax increase in 1932, whose full effects {{for the first time}} were felt in 1933, and it was undercut by spending cuts, especially the Economy Act. According to Keynesians like Paul Krugman the New Deal therefore was not as successful in the short run {{as it was in the}} long run.|$|E
25|$|Other war chiefs, such as Halleck Tustenuggee and John Jumper, and the Black Seminoles Abraham and John Horse, {{continued}} the Seminole resistance against the army. After a full decade of fighting, {{the war ended}} in 1842. Scholars estimate the U.S. government spent about $40,000,000 on the war, {{at the time a}} huge sum. An estimated 3,000 Seminole and 800 Black Seminole were forcibly exiled to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi, where they were settled on the Creek reservation. A few hundred survivors retreated into the Everglades. In the end, after the Third Seminole War, the government <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> subjugate the Seminole and left the estimated fewer than 500 survivors in peace.|$|E
25|$|For {{a moment}} {{it looked as if}} the police would manage to push home their attack, but some of the squatters were armed with tear-gas grenades and threw three of them into the shop. The police were {{carrying}} gas masks but it was impossible to don them without breaking their shield wall and thus exposing themselves to the incoming stones. The police attack broke. Fifteen officers were injured, and another 20-30 had to be taken to hospital to have their eyes flushed because of the tear gas. After this, the police <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> storm the barricades. The order was given that nobody was to try to enter the area. The police now focused on keeping the squatters inside the barricaded area. The police commanders feared that the squatters would try to expand the barricades to cut several main roads around the house.|$|E

25|$|Nicolae {{was born}} in the Moldavian capital, Iași, as one of Dimitrie's six children: he had two {{brothers}} (Alexandru and Filip, the future architect) and three sisters. He completed his secondary education in that city. By 1877, he was affiliated with Junimea, a conservative literary society founded by Maiorescu, Petre P. Carp, Iacob Negruzzi and other Moldavian men of letters. The club members responded to his quest for affirmation, and provided him with money to study abroad: after attending the University of Paris, he took his Doctor of Law diploma at the University of Liège. It was during his training period that Xenopol met and befriended other young Romanian students, including the future dramatist and theater manager Alexandru Davila. The grant did not meet all of his needs. He worked during most of college, and, for a while, <b>gave</b> <b>up,</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> enlist in the Romanian Land Forces, or concentrating on writing his novel Brazi și putregai ("Fir Trees and Rot").|$|E

So he <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> capture the entrance and made for St. Augustine. The three Spanish vessels which took the southerly course in pursuit of the remaining French ship continued the chase all night. Menéndez had ordered them to rejoin him {{at the mouth of the}} St. Johns in the morning, and, if unable to do so, to return to St. Augustine. A storm arose and they were obliged to cast anchor off the coast, the vessels being so small they dared not to take to the sea. One of the three broke away, and while in this peril a French ship was sighted, but it did not attack them, although it hove to within a league of their own ship.|$|E
500|$|Though she {{eventually}} <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> convert her non-Catholic subjects to Roman Catholicism, Maria Theresa regarded both the Jews and Protestants as {{dangerous to the}} state and actively tried to suppress them. The empress was probably the most anti-Semitic monarch of her time, having inherited the traditional prejudices of her ancestors and acquired new ones. This was a product of deep religious devotion and was not kept secret in her time. In 1777, she wrote of the Jews: [...] "I know of no greater plague than this race, which on account of its deceit, usury and avarice is driving my subjects into beggary. Therefore as far as possible, the Jews are to be kept away and avoided." ...|$|E

500|$|Over {{the next}} few days morale began to sink when Bf 109s from 7./JG 26, led by Oberleutnant Joachim Müncheberg {{appeared}} over Malta and immediately took a toll of Hurricanes. The British fighter could not match the performance of the Bf 109. MacLachlan took a flight of them by surprise on the 11 February but the German pilots spotted them in time, climbed and dived. According to MacLachlan they [...] "left us standing"—in his diary he noted the poor morale of the squadron owing {{to the success of the}} Bf 109s and he recorded the desperation of pilots eager to shoot one down. On 16 February 1941 MacLachlan's Hurricane Mk. Ia (V7731) was again in battle with the Luftwaffe. In the morning his squadron engaged Bf 109s over Malta. After careful manoeuvring he managed to get onto the tail of a Bf 109 but neglected to check his own six o'clock position. He was hit by cannon fire which shattered his engine and cockpit. His left arm began bleeding profusely and ceased to function. He managed to remove his helmet and radio equipment and slide back the canopy and jump out. MacLachlan <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> reach for his ripcord, assuming it must have been shot off. Later, MacLachlan said he had almost given up altogether when the thought of his mother reading the telegram informing her he had been killed in action spurred him on to try once again. He struggled and found the ripcord and deployed his parachute. Exhausted, he landed in a garden and lay there before being recovered.|$|E

2500|$|Jo-Han limped {{through the}} 1980s re-issuing old kits and promos. The company <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> retail its models {{and set up}} a branch company called X-El Products to sell reissued promos. The X-El reissues have {{sometimes}} been passed off as originals in antique malls and flea markets. The X-El Products era was an ironic time. Models were carefully prepared and respected by collectors, but there was no capital to develop new products, so the company fell into decline. One consumer purchase update card sent by X-El Products to buyers in 1988 encouraged patience when waiting for models that wer ordered, saying, [...] "These promos are not done on a mass production basis. They are practically made to order and babied from start to finish." [...] This is another way of saying that Jo-Han did not have the resources to improve their service. Nevertheless, the reproductions from this time have also escalated in collector value and were as well rendered as the original period promos, done with accurate color schemes.|$|E

2500|$|Ruby toured with Mildred {{during the}} summers of 1916 and 1917, and practiced her sister's {{routines}} backstage. Watching the movies of Pearl White, whom Ruby idolized, also influenced her drive to be a performer. At {{the age of}} 14, she {{dropped out of school}} to take a job wrapping packages at a department store in Brooklyn. Ruby never attended high school, [...] "although early biographical thumbnail sketches had her attending Brooklyn's famous Erasmus Hall High School." [...] Soon afterward, she took a job filing cards at the Brooklyn telephone office for $14 a week, which allowed her to become financially independent. She disliked both jobs; her real goal was to enter show business, even as her sister Mildred discouraged the idea. She then took a job cutting dress patterns for Vogue magazine, but because customers complained about her work, she was fired. Her next job was as a typist for the Jerome H. Remick Music Company, a job she reportedly enjoyed. However, her continuing ambition was to work in show business, and her sister finally <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> dissuade her.|$|E

[...] Such a loss would be a political failure, and Franco determined to make no concession. [...] He had just started a major offensive at Guadalajara, and to relieve Teruel meant he had to abandon that offensive, much to the disgust of his Italian and German allies. The Nationalist relief of Teruel also signified that Franco was giving up the idea of a knockout blow to end the war, and was accepting a long war of attrition to be won by weight of arms and foreign aid.|$|E
