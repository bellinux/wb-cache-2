40|$|The {{administration}} of absorbed nephrotoxic serum (NTS) to the laboratory rat produced immediate thrombocytopenia and hypofibrinogenaemia {{in addition to}} heavy proteinuria. Haemoglobinuria commonly occurred after a delay of 2 - 4 hours. Although plasma haemoglobin levels were frequently in excess of 100 mg/ 100 ml, haemoglobinuria developed in less severely affected animals with concentrations less than 20 mg/ 100 /ml. Histological examination of the kidney showed glomerular fibrin in the capillary loops, which were frequently occluded with aggregated erythrocytes. It is suggested that intraglomerular coagulation is initiated by platelets {{in response to the}} direct antibody-antigen reaction on the glomerular basement membrane and leads to local haemolysis in the glomerular capillary loops. The statistically significant correlations of blood platelet, plasma fibrinogen and plasma haemoglobin values with glomerular histological damage and the absence of <b>haematological</b> <b>disturbance</b> in anephric animals given NTS support this proposal. In addition, it was observed that the sequence of immune reaction, platelet deposition and local coagulation was especially {{associated with the use of}} fresh antibody obtained after prolonged immunization...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring {{describes}} the prospective supervision, observation, {{and testing of}} an ongoing process. The result of monitoring provides reassurance that the goal has been or will be achieved, or suggests changes that will {{allow it to be}} achieved. In therapeutics, most thought has been given to Therapeutic Drug Monitoring, that is, monitoring of drug concentrations to achieve benefit or avoid harm, or both. Patients and their clinicians can also monitor the progress of a disease, and adjust treatment accordingly, for example, to achieve optimum glycaemic control. Very little consideration has been given to the development of effective schemes for monitoring for the occurrence of adverse effects, such as biochemical or <b>haematological</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Significant harm may go undetected in controlled clinical trials. Even where harm is detected, published details of trials are usually insufficient to allow a practical monitoring scheme to be introduced. The result is that information available to prescribers, such as the Summary of Product Characteristics, frequently provides advice that is incomplete or impossible to follow. We discuss here the elements of logical schemes for monitoring for adverse drug reactions, and the possible contributions that computerized decision support can make. We should require evidence that if a monitoring scheme is proposed, it can be put into practice, will prove effective, and is affordable...|$|E
40|$|Transportation of {{yellowtail}} kingfish (Seriola lalandi Valenciennes) juveniles from hatchery to on-growing operations in New Zealand exposes {{the fish to}} significantly elevated carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations. Experiments were undertaken to assess metabolic and haematological stress responses after a 5 h period of hypercapnia followed by recovery in normocapnia. Mortality was low (0. 5 %) and secondary stress indices (blood glucose, blood lactate, muscle pH and muscle lactate) were largely unchanged during a simulated transportation and recovery, despite juveniles being exposed to CO 2 concentrations as high as 75 mg CO 2 L- 1 (38 mm Hg partial pressure). There was some <b>haematological</b> <b>disturbance</b> midway through simulated transports where water was maintained at fixed CO 2 concentrations of 8 and 50 mg CO 2 L- 1 (4 and 26 mm Hg, respectively). Persistent erythrocyte swelling continued during transport at 50 mg CO 2 L- 1, whereas at 8 mg CO 2 L- 1 haematological variables had returned to control levels. There was no mortality recorded {{for any of the}} treatments and haematological variables were restored to pre-manipulation levels after 31 h. The results indicated that juvenile {{yellowtail kingfish}} have a robust physiology and can cope with the stressors imposed by acute exposure to moderate to high levels of CO 2 associated with live transport...|$|E

40|$|HIV-infected {{patients}} commonly experience <b>haematological</b> <b>disturbances</b> including anemia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow failure may {{be caused}} by HIV itself, or by secondary involvement by opportunistic pathogens and malignancy. The need for multiple concomitant suppressive treatments may increase the risk of cytopenias. Strategy to reduce both anemia and neutropenia as well as to improve the haematological tolerance to myelotoxic agents have been developed by using haematological growth factors. So far, erythropoietin and granulocyte(macrophage) colony-stimulating factors have been successfully used in clinical trials including HIV-patients with either zidovudine-associated anemia or severe HIV or drug-induced neutropenia. However, according to the cost of these palliative approaches, {{there is a need for}} more reliable data showing that these growth factors could really have a major impact on the patient's compliance to therapy, reduction of hospitalization and infection rate and improvement of the overall survival.

40|$|The {{clinical}} and pathological findings of Babesia infection in 32 dogs in northern Australia are presented. Eleven different breed types were represented from 6 localities in north Queensland and one locality in northern Western Australia. Twenty three (72 %) were males. Babesia-infected dogs were grouped {{by the degree}} of <b>haematological</b> <b>disturbance</b> and clinical severity: Acute babesiosis (25 / 32), all pups with severe haemolytic anaemia; subclinical carriers (5 / 32) with non-specific malaise, characterised haematologically by a normal erythrogram but marked leucopenia; chronic anaemia, observed in 2 adult dogs. Pups were azotaemic (serum urea > 6. 6 mmol/l) and had elevated serum bilirubin levels (20. 8 to 48. 5 mmol/l). Total serum protein was usually within the normal range. Pups that died were also hypoglycaemic and severely hyperkalaemic (K+> 10 mmol/l). Low parasitaemias in routine blood smears complicated diagnosis but smears made from ear or toe capillaries, or after haematocrit concentration, greatly enhanced finding parasitised cells. At necropsy, pallor and jaundice were the most consistent observations. Haemoglobinuric nephrosis, an active reticulo-endothelial system and capillaries packed {{with large numbers of}} infected erythrocytes were the main histopathological findings. A combination of imidocarb dipropionate at 5 mg/kg body weight, given intramuscularly, with fluid therapy and blood transfusion was the most successful treatment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFour {{experimental}} regimes {{were designed}} to test {{the capacity of the}} Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus {{to make use of the}} energy saved form osmoregulation in an isotonic medium in overcoming the Winter Stress Syndrome (WSS). Fish either pre- acclimated to freshwater or isotonic salinity at 25 °C were transferred directly to freshwater or an isotonic medium (ca. 12 ‰) at 14 °C. Fish were killed 3, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 168 h after transfer. The mobilisation and use of lipids from perivisceral and muscle fat observed in the study seem to be a direct response to cold stress as well as the associated fasting, these effects were salinity dependent being lesser at the isotonic salinity. The energy needs of fish diminish in cold conditions when the salinity of the environment approaches the isotonicity. The absence of any significant changes in muscle and water content indicated that the changes of muscle lipid are true and lipid was the sole source of energy upon thermal drop. The changes of blood haemoglobin levels throughout the four experimental regimes may indicate that the isotonic medium acclimated tilapia showed less <b>haematological</b> <b>disturbance</b> due to cold stress. Results from this experimental study recommend that the pre-acclimation of the Egyptian strain of Nile tilapia, O. niloticus, to an environmental salinity close to the isotonicity may improve fish cold tolerance...|$|E
40|$|Recombinant {{interleukin}} 2 (rIL- 2) and flavone {{acetic acid}} (FAA) {{were used to}} treat 34 patients with progressing metastatic melanoma. Five patients had solely non-visceral disease and the median number of organ sites involved was two. Five doses of rIL- 2 were given, the first dose intrasplenically via a femoral artery catheter with a further dose 4 h later i. v. and the other doses i. v. on alternate days. The rIL- 2 dose was 11 x 10 (6) Cetus units m- 2; the day before rIL- 2, FAA (4. 8 G m- 2) was given as a 6 h i. v. infusion, {{in order to enhance}} further killer cell activity. A total of three courses at 21 -day intervals was planned and 74 courses in all were given. Despite the high dose of rIL- 2 and the potential overlapping toxicity affecting blood pressure with the addition of FAA, side-effects were generally mild. There were only five episodes of grade 4 toxicity: one of ventricular tachycardia and four other episodes of transient biochemical or <b>haematological</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Grade 3 hypotension or hypertension occurred on 22 courses but again was transient. No patient required intensive care facilities. Five patients had tumour response, one being complete. Responses occurred in pulmonary and hepatic metastases, but mainly in non-visceral sites. Eleven patients remain alive at 6 - 17 months and in five there is no relapse or progression of disease. Despite the impressive results in animal tumour models, the addition of FAA to rIL- 2 in the present study has not markedly improved results over rIL- 2 alone...|$|E
30|$|Voltammetric {{determination}} of Hg(II) ions in blood media was studied using modified GCE {{with and without}} modified CNT. The determination {{was based on the}} finding {{of the results of the}} oxidation current peak by cyclic voltammetric technique. The enhancement of oxidation current peak of Hg(II) in the presence of AA causes the decomposition and damage in blood composition. This contribution accentuates the role of electrochemical techniques in the {{determination of}} oxidant activity in the biological blood sample. Electrochemical techniques represent due to selectivity and sensitivity suitable tool for the determination of oxidant capacity in biological blood sample, where these methods are sensitive under the low concentrations of AA affected on the oxidation current peak of Hg(II). In addition, obtaining oxidation current peaks and their position enable us to estimate the possible oxidant agent present in a blood sample. These findings suggest that mercury present in the environment and in particular in foodstuffs especially in seafood of first necessity causes <b>haematological</b> <b>disturbances</b> in the blood composition.|$|R

Regarding to these results, it was aimed to investigate the <b>haematological</b> <b>disturbances</b> in liver cirrhotic patients. In the result there was a correlation between activated partial thromboplastin time, serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, haptoglobin and Child-Pugh classification.

40|$|Background: Lead causes acute, sub-acute {{or chronic}} {{poisoning}} through occupational exposure along with decrease in some trace elements like iron, whose absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination being affected. Iron deficiency {{is a serious}} problem especially in developing countries and lead toxicity can augment anaemia directly by decreasing absorption of Iron and also by inhibiting enzymes of heme synthesis. Aim and Objectives: To assess haematological indices and serum iron and ferritin levels in Enamel paint industry workers who are exposed to very high Lead levels due to their occupation, and determine iron deficiency anaemia. Materials and Methods: Blood lead concentration was measured by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometric (AAS) method. Haematological tests were performed using cell counter to measure haemoglobin, red blood cell and white blood cell count, etc. Mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration were calculated. Serum ferritin and iron levels were assayed by chemilumenescence and spectrophotometric methods respectively. Results: All the parameters measured and calculated were found to be altered in paint workers as compared to healthy controls, with significant increase in blood lead level and decrease in the haematological as well as other analyte values. Conclusion: There seems to be a direct relationship between chronic lead exposure and the <b>haematological</b> <b>disturbances,</b> resulting in iron deficiency anaemia. Hence awareness about this association should be increased and protective measures should be implied accordingly. ...|$|R
40|$|AIMS [...] To {{study the}} {{correlations}} between total vitamin B 12 (B 12), holo-haptocorrin, and holo-transcobalamin II (holo-TCII) concentrations in human sera; the association between reduced holo-TCII concentrations and macrocytosis attributable to B 12 deficiency. METHODS [...] Serum samples from 38 healthy volunteers, 113 patients with normal total serum B 12 concentrations and 93 patients with low total serum B 12 were studied. Holo-TCII was removed from whole serum by adsorption with amorphous precipitated silica, and both whole serum and adsorbed serum were assayed for B 12 using the Becton Dickinson vitamin B 12 [57 Co] radioassay kit. RESULTS [...] In all three groups of subjects studied there were strong correlations between the logarithms of the total serum B 12 and the holo-haptocorrin concentrations with regression coefficients between 0. 884 and 0. 967. By contrast, {{the correlations between}} the logarithms of the total serum B 12 and holo-TCII concentrations were weaker, especially in the patients with normal or low total serum B 12, for whom the regression coefficients were 0. 491 and 0. 391, respectively. Analysis of the clinical records of a proportion of the patients studied indicated that there were many more patients with low holo-TCII concentrations than with <b>haematological</b> <b>disturbances</b> related to B 12 deficiency. CONCLUSIONS [...] The total serum B 12 concentration is a relatively poor indicator of holo-TCII concentrations and, therefore, of the ability of serum to deliver B 12 to tissues. Additional information regarding B 12 values can therefore be gleaned from measuring holo-TCII concentrations in the serum. Low holo-TCII concentrations, however, are an early sign of negative B 12 balance and are frequently unassociated with haematological abnormalities caused by B 12 deficiency...|$|R
40|$|Mitoxantrone (MTX) is an antineoplastic {{agent that}} can induce hepato- and haematotoxicity. This work aimed to {{investigate}} the occurrence of cumulative early and late MTX-induced hepatic and <b>haematological</b> <b>disturbances</b> in an vivo model. A control group and two groups treated with three cycles of 2. 5 mg/kg MTX at days 0, 10 and 20 were formed. One of the treated groups suffered euthanasia on day 22 (MTX 22) to evaluate early MTX toxic effects, while the other suffered euthanasia on day 48 (MTX 48), to allow the evaluation of MTX late effects. An early immunosuppression with {{a drop in the}} IgG levels was observed, causing a slight decrease in the plasma total protein content. The early bone marrow depression was followed by signs of recovery in MTX 48. The genotoxic potential of MTX was demonstrated by the presence of several micronuclei in MTX 22 leucocytes. Increases in plasma iron and cholesterol levels in the MTX 22 rats were observed, while in both groups increases in the unconjugated bilirubin, C 4 complement, and decreases in the triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and transferrin were found in plasma samples. On MTX 48, the liver histology showed more hepatotoxic signs, the hepatic levels of reduced and oxidized glutathione were increased, and ATP hepatic levels were decreased. However, the hepatic total protein levels were decreased only in the livers of MTX 22 group. Results demonstrated the MTX genotoxic effects, haemato- and direct hepatotoxicity. While the haematological toxicity is ameliorated with time, the same was not observed in the hepatic injury.

40|$|Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) acclimated {{to water}} salinities ranging from 28 %o to 7 %o {{were exposed to}} mild (8. 0 kPa) or severe (4. 0 kPa) hypoxic {{conditions}} for 6 h. In each experiment, respiratory, acid-base, ionic, <b>haematological</b> and metabolic <b>disturbances</b> were analyzed. During mild hypoxia, a strong hyperventi-latory response was observed, resulting in a respiratory alkalosis that persisted throughout the 6 -h trial. Plasma Cl ~ and pyruvate levels were the only other variables to display significant changes: they both increased. In more severe hypoxic conditions, although the ventilatory response was the same, a weak metabolic acidosis was superimposed. The haematological response (increased haematocrit and decreased mean cellular haemoglobin content) suggested that catecholamines were released into the blood. Both Na+ and Cl ~ concentrations increased significantly. Metabolic perturbations occurred: plasma lactate, pyru-vate and glucose concentrations increased markedly. Though lactate concen-trations in liver, heart and white muscle increased, the concentrations of pyruvate, glucose and glycogen did not change significantly. Water salinity affected the amplitude of the ionic responses during hypoxia: the amplitude decreased with decreasing salinity. Irrespective of water salinity, 23 of 29 fish survived the severe hypoxic conditions. This relatively good tolerance of low water oxygenation, as compared with other marine bottom-feeders, suggests that this species may face poorly oxygenated waters in the wild. Together with temperature and salinity, water oxygen content may thus be an important variable {{to take into account}} {{in the study of the}} distribution and migration patterns of Atlantic cod...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the protective effect of rIL- 10 on lipopolysaccharide-(LPS-) induced <b>haematological</b> and biochemical <b>disturbances</b> in rats. In the present study, 40 rats were used and divided equally into four groups. Group 1 (control group, C) was treated with 0. 9 % saline. Group 2 : LPS was injected intravenously (1. 6 mg/ 100 g), Group 3 received rIL 10 treatment (125 μg/kg) 2 min before 0. 9 % saline injection, Group 4 received rIL 10 treatment 2 min before endotoxin treatment. When compared with the controls, platelet count, leukocyte count (with a marked neutrophilia and lymphopenia) and fibrinogen were decreased, while activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) were prolonged in the endotoxaemic rats. In addition, LPS caused statistically significant increases in plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities as well as creatinine, cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, while it caused a statistically significant decrease in glucose, total protein and albumin levels as compared to the control group. On the other hand, rIL 10 significantly suppressed <b>disturbances</b> in the <b>haematological</b> and biochemical parameters associated with endotoxaemia. As a result, rIL 10 may be efficacious in preventing haematological disorders, tissue damage and changes in lipid, protein and carbohydrate metabolism in endotoxaemia...|$|R
40|$|Mini-dissertation (M. Sc.) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2001. BACKGROUND: Oxygen is {{essential}} for life. If any factor inhibits the body's usage of oxygen, the body will react {{with a variety of}} feedback systems to retain life. When a person stays in an area with a slightly lower oxygen concentration for a long period, his body will react with an increase in the amount of erythrocytes (Cuyton & Hall, 2000 : 497). When a group of people shows an increased amount of erythrocytes when compared to a normal group, {{it could be that the}} first group's bodies have reacted to an insufficient oxygen supply to the tissues. The purpose of this study is to investigate if workers at a coal tar plant have disturbed haematological values and should that be the case, if, it is caused by volatile organic compounds. METHOD: A group of 20 white males working at a coal tar plant of a petrochemical factory was used as Experimental group. A Control group of 20 white males living in a town which is remote from any petrochemical factory and which is on the same height above sea level as the Experimental environment, was paired to the Experimental group. Pairing of subjects was done on grounds of age, smoking habits, drinking habits, exercising habits, the period the person stayed in the area and usage of vitamin and iron supplements. Complete blood counts (CBC) of both groups were done, where the previous year's CBC results of the Experimental group were also gathered. Exposure of the Experimental group to volatile organic compounds (VOC) was monitored by using G. A. B. I. E. badges during the annual shut down of the factory. Oxygen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide concentrations were determined in both environments. The meteorological data of the Experimental environment were gathered on the days of VOC monitoring. RESULTS: The mean haematological parameters - from the CBC - of the Control group were normal. The Experimental group showed highly significant (p ≤ 0, 001) differences in red blood cell count (RBC), haemoglobin (Hb) and haematocrit (Hct) when compared to the Control group, where the values of the Experimental group were higher than that of the Control group. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) of the Experimental group diminished significantly (p ≤ 0, 05) over a period of one year. The Experimental group was exposed to 14 different VOC's and all the exposure levels were far below the exposure limits from the Hazardous Chemical Substances Regulations (1995) in the Occupational Health and Safety Act (85 / 1993). •	Exposure to n-hexane and toluene showed strong negative correlations with the RBC. •	Xylene showed a negative correlation with the MCV and a positive correlation with the MCH. •	 3 -methylpentane showed a positive correlation with the RBC. The oxygen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide concentrations of both environments were well below the prescribed limits. DISCUSSION: The Control group represented a normal group which means it can be proved that the Experimental group showed <b>haematological</b> <b>disturbances</b> because their RBC, Hct and Hb values were significantly higher than those of the Control group. When these disturbances were connected to the exposure to VOC's, correlations showed that VOC's had a close connection with RBC. A number of VOC's, like benzene, is known for its ability to cause damage to the bone marrow and to cause hyperplasia. Considering that the oxygen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide concentrations were the same in both environments, and that height above sea level, habits and personal information with the Control group were compensated for, it seems as if a number of VOC's act synergistically to damage the bone marrow of the Experimental group. The body tries to compensate by producing more erythrocytes (Guyton & Hall, 2000 : 385) which is the cause of the high RBC, Hct and Hb. CONCLUSION: Workers of the Coal tar plant showed an elevated RBC, Hct and Hb. Exposure to a variety of VOC's could possibly cause destruction of the bone marrow which in turn caused hyperplasia of the remaining bone marrow, thereby attempting to supply the demand for red blood cells in the body and thereby causing the red blood cell count to raise. Although the exposure to VOC's complies entirely to the law, the effect of long-term low level exposure may be the cause of the disturbed erythrocyte parameters. The lowering of MCV, MCH and MCHC of workers is probably an indication that a type of anaemia is beginning to develop. But further research is necessary before any definite utterance can be made. Research concerning the erythropoietin levels, leukocytes, platelets and bone marrow function of these workers should be conducted. A longitudinal study where animals are used as experimental subjects should throw some light on the subject. Master...|$|R
