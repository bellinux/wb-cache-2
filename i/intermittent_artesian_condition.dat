Artesian wells within all four aquifers occur at elevations below 5. 2 meters above sea level (MASL) but predominantly below 3. 0 MASL.

40|$|Most of {{exogenous}} epigenetic sulphur deposits {{are clearly}} associated with intensely karstified carbonate and sulphate rocks. This paper demonstrates, using the Pre-Carpathian region as an example, that karstification {{is one of}} the most important processes guiding the formation of sulphur deposits. This is determined by a coincidence of some major prerequisites of these two processes. In the Podol'sky and Bukovinsky regions the Miocene aquifer system is well drained by erosion valleys; the giant network caves known here in gypsum formed under past <b>artesian</b> <b>conditions.</b> In the region of sulphur deposits, associated with the same karstified gypsum strata, true <b>artesian</b> <b>conditions</b> still prevail. Hydrogeologic data show that abundant cavities detected in the vicinity of sulphur deposits can be interpreted as having the same origin as the relict caves of the Podol'sky and Bukovinsky regions. The widespread belief that the gypsum/anhydrite bed in the region is an aquifuge separating the Miocene aquifers is inadequate. This belief caused much controversy with regard to the genetic interpretations of sulphur deposits in the region. Cave systems formed by the upward water flow through the gypsum/anhydrite bed govern the water exchange between the aquifers within the aquifer system. A new karst model for the formation of sulphur deposits is suggested. It agrees well with the hydrogeological features of the Miocene sequence and with biogeochemical mechanisms of sulphur origin in low-temperature diagenetic environments...|$|R

40|$|We report {{engineering}} experiences {{from the}} critical task of relief well installation under high <b>artesian</b> flow <b>conditions</b> at the downstream toe of the Karkheh earth dam, Iran. Due {{to the establishment}} of excessive uplift pressure at the downstream toe of the Karkheh dam, installation of a series of new relief wells was considered to permanently relieve part of these pressures. The mentioned uplift pressure, as high as around 30 m above the ground level, was produced in a confined conglomerate aquifer bounded above and below by relatively impervious mudstone layers which reduced the safety factor of the dam toe to below 1. 0. Investigations on the shortcomings of the old relief wells installed at the dam site showed that the main problems were: insufficient well numbers, insufficient well diameters, irregular well screens causing their blockage by time passing, and insufficient total opening area. Despite engineering difficulties and associated risk of downstream toe instability, installation of new relief wells was successfully completed under high <b>artesian</b> flow <b>conditions</b> ” was successfully completed.

Linear stability analysis of perturbations out of the stationary state of uniform fluidisation shows that granular inertia plays a destabilising role that leads to mathematical ill-posedeness, which in turn is removed by considering the effect of the mixture's viscosity...|$|R

Karst genesis modelling is applied to a conceptual setting based on field observations from the Western Ukraine, where gypsum layers are typically supplied by artesian flow of aggressive water from insoluble aquifers underneath. Processes and parameters, controlling solutional enlargement of single conduits under <b>artesian</b> <b>conditions,</b> are identified in detailed sensitivity analyses. The development of conduit networks is examined in parameter studies, suggesting that the evolution of maze caves is predetermined by structural preferences such as laterally extended fissure networks beneath a horizon less prone to karstification. Short-term karst spring response after recharge events is firstly examined in parameter studies by forward modelling. The numerical simulations reveal that different controlling processes of heat and solute transport account for the different behaviour of water temperature and solute concentration frequently observed at karst springs. In order to test the feasibility of the inverse approach, the model is applied to a field site in Southern Germany (Urenbrunnen, Vöhringen).

Wonderkrater is a spring mound consisting entirely of peat in excess of 8 m thick. It has yielded a pollen record extending back over 35, 000 years, which has provided {{one of the very}} few proxy climatic records for the interior of southern Africa in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. The current investigation of the morphology and sedimentology of the site has revealed that the peat mound formed due to <b>artesian</b> <b>conditions</b> at the spring, but that accumulation of the thick peat succession was made possible because of clastic sedimentation on the surrounding piedmont which in turn was brought about by aggradation on the adjacent Nyl River floodplain. The peat mound has remained elevated relative to the surrounding piedmont for most of the 35, 000 year period. Aggradation of the mound was slower during the Late Pleistocene than the Holocene (0. 06 ? 0. 1 m/ 1000 year and 0. 2 ? 0. 38 m/ 1000 year, respectively). Controlled archaeological excavations yielded a diverse late Pleistocene fauna preserved in peat and sand in the mound.

40|$|AbstractThe {{construction}} of a test embankment on ultra-soft ground containing an approximately 50 -m-deep soft peat layer with N-values of 0 to 1 {{did not result in}} catastrophic slip failure during construction but did cause substantial deformation of the adjacent ground. In addition, large-scale settlement in excess of 11 m occurred in the approximately 3 years following embankment construction. Based on field observations, it became evident that this large settlement was attributable to delayed compression of the deep peat layer, which was assumed at the design stage not to be subject to settlement. Based on laboratory tests and site investigations, it was deduced that due to depositions under continuous <b>artesian</b> <b>conditions,</b> this peat layer had an extremely low consolidation yield stress and was in a state such that even a slight increase in stress would result in large-scale compression. After confirming the ability of the analysis code based on soil–water coupled finite deformation theory, which included an elasto-plastic constitutive equation describing the behavior of the soil skeleton, to reproduce the observed ground behavior, the code was used to predict future settlement. These simulations were then used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} countermeasures aimed not only at improving stability during construction, but also at reducing residual settlement. The results of these analyses were applied in the planning of large-scale repair work performed on the test embankment. Also, when an embankment was subsequently constructed near the test embankment on similar ultra-soft ground, ground improvements were conducted prior to embankment construction as a countermeasure against residual settlement. In this paper, valuable field data related to these latter construction efforts is also presented...|$|R

40|$|Willow Creek Dam {{is located}} in a unique region on the {{boundary}} of a confined aquifer, where <b>artesian</b> <b>conditions</b> exist. Recently, groundwater levels have exceeded the elevation of the downstream berm well above anticipated piezometric elevations. It was presumed from limited evidence that these high piezometric levels resulted from pressure in the aquifer rather than from seepage out of the reservoir. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the relative contributions of the reservoir and the regional groundwater to observed piezometric levels and how these levels affect seepage exit gradients and slope stability of the dam. Comparing the head levels in shallow and deep piezometers at the dam, the seepage is shown to originate from the regional aquifer and to flow upwards. The head in the groundwater exceeds the reservoir elevation, and the reservoir elevation has little influence on local phreatic elevations. The largest annual fluctuations in the groundwater levels result from local irrigation pumping. Influences of irrigation wells were quantified using a well influence statistic derived for this study. This statistic was found to be the best predictor of variation in groundwater elevations at the dam. Using a finite element analysis program, it was shown that the regional aquifer provides all the flow into the relief well system and solely contributes to the exit gradients long the downstream toe. Flow rates in the dam’s 27 pressure relief wells were found to be less than the flow rates when the reservoir was first filled, even though piezometer levels are much higher now. This points to a need to redevelop the pressure relief wells. Resulting higher relief well flow will decrease the piezometric levels at the dam and will result in reduced exit gradients. Local and global slope stability was not found to be in jeopardy with local seepage failure occurring well before stability failures. Advisor: John R. Rohd...|$|R

According to data gathered by researchers at the Autonomous University of Nuevo León in Mexico, a medium annual precipitation of 538 mm/year within the Buenos Aires wellfield´s catchment area is sufficient to recharge the aquifer while allowing for a discharge of around 1,600 L/s (400 gal.) that can safely be extracted at any given time. In 1998, the wellfield was operated at a mean discharge of 1,535 L/s. Due to higher extraction during most of the last 25 years however, dynamic levels in some of the wells have been observed to drop almost 100 meters {{over a period of several}} years indicating possible over-exploitation.

Throughout the northern shelf, intrastratal dissolution and brecciation of the San Andres formation is widespread as a result of eastward migration of the Pecos River. Proximal to the current river, hypogene dissolution in interbedded carbonate/evaporite facies of the Seven Rivers Formation has produced three-dimensional network caves and vertical collapse structures. In the carbonate reeffacies of the Guadalupe Mountains, complex three dimensional caves are common, as well as stepped terraces associated with eastward migration of thePecos River. Although these caves have been attributed to sulfuric acid dissolution, they are the result of hypogene speleogenesis in which solutional aggressivity was increased by the addition of both thermal and sulfuric-acid components. Within the interior of the Delaware Basin, hypogene karst in basin-filling evaporite facies of the Castile and Salado Formations is widespread, including development of large solution subsidence troughs associated with the lateral migration of the Pecos River. On the far eastern margin of the Delaware Basin, at the southeastern tip of the Central Basin Platform, persistent down cutting of the Pecos River Valley contributed to the development of hypogene karst within the Yates Petroleum Field, providing cavernous reservoir porosity for the largest individual oil field known within the Permian Basin region. Immediately below the confluence of the Pecos River and the Rio Grande, the large first order magnitude spring, Goodenough Spring, flows from a deep phreatic cave under extreme <b>artesian</b> <b>conditions,</b> even as 45 meters of pressure head has been added over the spring from Amistad Reservoir...|$|R
40|$|Open pit copper mining was {{performed}} at Kimheden four decades ago. The waste rock was stored in heaps {{next to the}} two open pits, which lead {{to the formation of}} acid mine drainage. Therefore, the waste rock was gradually backfilled to the open pits and allowed to water saturate to the natural water level. A ditch system was constructed to reduce the water inflows into the pit and to collect mine water for treatment. Additionally a dry cover was applied after the final backfilling. Mine water has been monitored since 1983, but does not show satisfactory low metal concentrations for a release into the environment. This study focuses on the hydrogeology of the pit, which generates the larger contaminant load and also on the collection ditch, with particular attention on water flow paths. Methods applied for this study were water level measurements, slug tests, mapping of the electrical conductivity in seepages, site water balance, and water quality analysis. Compared to the surrounding bedrock and the overlying natural till the hydraulic conductivity is quite high within the pit. It ranges over two orders of magnitude and is inhomogenously distributed. The data suggests two major sources of inflows from fractures in the bedrock into the pit. The largest volumes of mine water appear to flow out from the pit at its southern end and from a protrusion close to its center. The latter outflows additionally seem to contain the highest contaminant concentrations. The indicated outflow locations match those that were simulated by a digital flow model. The investigation of the collection ditch has shown that there is a high probability of vertical exchange fluxes between the natural till and the underlying bedrock, and that downward fluxes seem to dominate over upward ones, suggesting the infiltration of surface water into the ground. According to the water balance, large volumes of mine water are flowing underneath the shallow collection ditch. Seasonal variations in the water level of the pit cause different water saturation degrees of the waste rock and a wash-out effect during spring flood. The dry cover creates confined conditions {{in the southern part of}} the pit, which extend to <b>artesian</b> <b>conditions</b> during spring flood. This might lead to a disturbance of the cover’s integrity by up-pressing water, but could also prevent a possible overflowing of the pit during high water level conditions. Some suggestions for future reclamation measures at the site are presented within this work. Validerat; 20150112 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
40|$|Intrastratal karst {{is by far}} the {{predominant}} gypsum karst type. Its development may begin in deep-seated settings within rocks already buried by younger strata, and it proceeds increasingly rapidly as uplift brings gypsum sequences into progressively shallower positions. Such development commonly occurs under confined (<b>artesian)</b> hydrogeological <b>conditions,</b> that subsequently change to open conditions (phreatic-water table-vadose). The general evolutionary line of intrastratal karst is typified by progressive emergence of a sequence into a shallower position, activation of groundwater circulation and development of cave systems within karst units, commencement of gravitational breakdown and its upward propagation through overlying beds, and development of a karst landscape. These processes and phenomena progress through the directed evolution of karst types as follows: deep-seated intrastratal karst (1 K) to subjacent 1 K to entrenched 1 K to denuded karst. One of the main characteristics of intrastratal karst is that it induces gravitational breakdown in cover beds. With the aid of processes other then simple breakdown, such effects may propagate upwards and may, or may not, reach the surface, depending upon the thickness and structure of the overburden. A karst landscape evolves when such features reach the surface. This paper considers the conditions and mechanisms of such development...|$|R
40|$|Buckeye Valley, one of {{the largest}} {{irrigation}} districts of the lower Salt River Valley, includes an area of 150 square miles within Maricopa County. It is about 42 miles southwest of Phoenix and the Gila River is the main drainage in the area. The rock units in Buckeye Valley are: (1) Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks, (2) volcanic rocks of Quaternary age, and (3) sedimentary rocks of Tertiary and Quaternary age divided into surficial sediments (A), and valley fill (B) 0 The valley fill is divided into four subunits: (1) basal conglomerate rocks, (2) Buckeye silty clayey beds, (3) alluvial deposits, and (4) alluvial mantle. The sedimentary rocks of the valley fill are the main aquifers. The ground water occurs under <b>artesian</b> <b>conditions</b> in the basal conglomerate rocks below the Buckeye silty clayey beds, and under nonartesian conditions in the alluvial deposits. The artesian aquifer and the water-table aquifer are referred to as the basal conglomerate aquifer and the Buckeye salty aquifer, respectively. The Buckeye salty aquifer has a saturated thickness ranging from 50 to 200 feet {{in different parts of the}} valley and wells yield from 100 to 3, 500 gallons per minute. The amount of water in storage in the Buckeye salty aquifer, assuming 12 percent specific yield, is about 750, 000 acre-feet. The saturated thickness of the basal conglomerate aquifer is not known. The yield of wells producing water is low, mostly less than 50 gallons per minute. The movement of ground water in the Buckeye salty aquifer is toward the south and southwestern parts of the valley. Water is discharged via underfiow into the Gila River channel in the southwestern corner of Buckeye Valley. The main sources of recharge are from irrigation water and from floods in washes during the rainy season. For the period 1952 - 60 the water-table decline was about 8 feet in most of the valley, but was 23 feet in the northwestern corner for the same period of time. The chemical quality of water from the Buckeye salty aquifer is poor, ranging from 2, 000 to 6, 000 parts per million of total dissolved solids. This water is not adequate for domestic use but is used mostly for irrigation. The water has a high to very high salinity hazard and sodium adsorption ratio. It can be used on salt-tolerant crops only with adequate drainage and the addition of chemical and organic matter. The water of the basal conglomerate aquifer has total dissolved solids of about 600 ppm 0 It is generally suitable for domestic use. However, it has a fluoride content of 1. 6 ppm. The water from both the basal conglomerate aquifer and the Buckeye salty aquifer is classified as sodium chloride water...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of aquifer {{characteristics}} {{was one of}} the {{facets of}} hydrological investigations started in l 95 in the Indus plains of West Pakistan. Rechna and Chaj Doabs (area between Ravi and Chenab rivers; Fig. 1) were the first to be investigated. Analysis of the pumping tests in these areas was made after methods of Theis and Jacob. The values of storage coefficients obtained indicated <b>artesian</b> <b>conditions</b> but this was in conflict with the available geological evidence. Transmissibilities were also questionably high, and there was a disparity between results calculated from time-drawdown versus distance-drawdown analyses. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to understand the flow regime around a pumping well in the area of study; to identify the causes of inapplicability of Theis' analysis method, and to evaluate alternative approaches for analysis of pumping tests in this area. Analysis of four specially designed long duration pumping tests indicates that vertical components of flow due to partial penetration and a variable storage coefficient due to slow drainage are the two major factors which control the aquifer response and make Theis' method inapplicable. In the initial pumping period the effect of partial penetration on drawdown is very significant whereas the effect of delayed yield is inappreciable. In general, the effect of partial penetration is more pronounced throughout the pumping period as compared to delayed yield. However, with increasing distance from the pumping well, the partial penetration effects decrease rapidly and thereby become less important. It was found that analysis of the first 20 - 40 minutes of pumping data, with allowance for partial penetration, gave an accurate value of "P" and artesian storage. In most cases the effective depth of aquifer could also be estimated. Observation wells at about l. 5 b or farther from the pumped well, with adjustment for delayed yield, gave good values of specific yield and transmissibility. Close agreement was observed between the values of "T" from both methods. The use of data of nearer wells for the partial penetration analysis, and the farther well data at later times for the delayed yield analysis provided the best approach for aquifer characteristic determination. In the present analysis the effects of anisotropy and vertical component of flow due to lowering water table are so small relative to the partial penetration influence that they do not affect the early data analysis. However, a method has been suggested to account for these factors if in any test their magnitude appears significant. The average value found for permeability was 7. 5 x 10 ^- 4 ft/sec, the artesian storage coefficient was in the range of 0. 0001 - 0. 005, and specific yield was 0. 2 - 0. 25. The effective depth of aquifer taking part ranged from 720 feet to over 1500 feet...|$|R
40|$|The “Green Sahara” pluvial phases that alternated with North African hyper-aridity {{during the}} Pleistocene are well {{recognized}} in tropical and Mediterranean marine records. However, comparatively {{few studies have}} investigated the terrestrial expression of these pluvials, {{in part because of}} the paucity of paleohydrologic archives in the desert. In this study, we show that the travertine record of Egypt’s Western Desert constitutes a promising terrestrial proxy for North African paleohydrology. Integrating our reconnaissance sampling of travertine and modern groundwaters from five important oasis areas with data from previously published studies, we combine high-precision U/Th dating, geologic characterization, and stable isotope and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr geochemistry to contribute to a record of Egyptian pluvial periods for the last ~ 650 ka. We show that changing hydrologic head controlled voluminous travertine deposition and dictated its landscape position, and that major depositional episodes were largely synchronous across the Western Desert, suggesting a regional signal. We confirm previous findings that large volume deposition occurred across oasis areas at ~ 125 ka, as well as constraining major deposition from ~ 450 - 600 ka. We also show that at least some lacustrine deposits at Dahkla Oasis associated with paleolithic artifacts are 300 - 350 ka rather than ~ 130 ka. A comparison of travertine geochemistry with modern groundwater chemistry suggests that a consistent Nubian groundwater source has fed travertine deposition over the last half million years. Dakhla Oasis has an enriched 87 Sr/ 86 Sr signature in both modern groundwater (0. 7170 - 0. 7211) and travertine (~ 0. 7098), reflecting water circulation through radiogenic basement rocks; higher 87 Sr/ 86 Sr in modern waters is interpreted to be due to deeper tapping of modern pumped waters relative to past <b>artesian</b> <b>conditions.</b> Travertine stable isotopic signatures from Dahkla also differ from the other oases and are interpreted to reflect its lacustrine rather than spring-mound depositional environment. These observations lead to a depositional model in which travertine accumulations around paleo-oasis springs reflect episodes of enhanced spring discharge deriving from high hydrologic head in the Nubian aquifer system. Increased head in the artesian system, in turn, is interpreted as a response to greater precipitation in southern groundwater recharge areas. Importantly, discharge from these travertine-depositing springs includes significant upward flux of deeply-derived carbonic fluids through faults in paleo-oasis areas. Thus, in this model, large-scale travertine accumulations serve as an archive of wet intervals in the Ethiopian-Sudan recharge region, which are then expressed in oasis springs following the short (< 10 ka) lapse time it takes for transmission of high head pressure from the highlands to the oasis springs. This idea is supported by the fact that peak times of large volume travertine deposition are associated, roughly, with sapropels, indicating response to major regional pluvial episodes. However, our data do not show a coherent correlation to glacial cycles, suggesting that previous emphasis on travertine’s association with glacial forcings should be scrutinized. In summary, our study reveals that travertine deposition in broadly synchronous regional episodes across the Western Desert is consistent with the pluvial events recognized in marine records. Subject to further testing, we interpret large volume travertine deposition in Egypt’s Western Desert to be a pluvial indicator ultimately responding to orbital forcing.
