40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective: A theory-based protection/risk {{model was}} ap-plied to explain {{variation}} in college students ' <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking.</b> Key aims were (1) {{to establish that}} psychosocial and behavioral protec-tive factors and risk factors can account for cross-sectional and devel-opmental variation in <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> and (2) to examine whether protection moderates the impact of risk on heavy episbdic drink-ing. Method: Random- and fixed-effects maximum likelihood regres-sion analyses were used to examine data from a three-wave longitudinal study. Data were collected in fall of 2002, spring of 2003, and spring of 2004 from college students (N = 975; 548 men) who were first-semester freshmen at Wave 1. Results: Psychosocial and behavioral protective and risk factors accounted for substantial variation in college-student <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> and protection moderated the impact of risk. Findings held for both genders and were consistent across the three separate waves of data. Key predictors of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> were social and individual controls protection (e. g., parental sanctions for transgression and attitudinal intolerance of deviance, respectively); models risk (peer models for substance use); behavioral protection (at-tendance at religious services); and behavioral risk (cigarette smoking and marijuana use). Changes in controls protection, models risk, and opportunity risk were associated with change in heavy episodic drink-ing.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{examined}} alcohol use patterns among {{men and women}} with depression seeking outpatient psychiatric treatment, including factors associated with recent <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> and motivation to reduce alcohol consumption. METHODS: The sample consisted of 1, 183 patients aged 18 and over who completed a self-administered, computerized intake questionnaire and who scored ≥ 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Additional measures included current and past alcohol questions based on the Addiction Severity Index, <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> (≥ 5 drinks on 1 or more occasions in the past year), alcohol-related problems on the Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (SMAST), and motivation to reduce drinking using the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES). RESULTS: Among those who consumed any alcohol in the past year (73. 9 % of the sample), <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> in the past year was reported by 47. 5 % of men and 32. 5 % of women. In logistic regression, prior-year <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> was associated with younger age (p = 0. 011), male gender (p = 0. 001), and cigarette smoking (p = 0. 002). Among patients reporting <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> motivation to reduce alcohol consumption was associated with older age (p = 0. 008), greater usual quantity of alcohol consumed (p < 0. 001), and higher SMAST score (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to prior clinical studies, we examined subdiagnostic alcohol use and related problems among psychiatric outpatients with depression. Patients reporting greater drinking quantities and alcohol-related problems also express more motivation to reduce drinking, providing intervention opportunities for mental health providers that should not be overlooked...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and Aims The {{link between}} alcohol and men 2 ̆ 7 s {{aggression}} is well established, although growing evidence {{also points to}} individual and learned social factors. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the relationships between male alcohol-related aggression (MARA) among young Australian men and <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> trait aggression, masculinity, concerns about social honour and expected positive consequences of MARA. Design and Methods The total sample comprised 170 men aged 18 – 25 years who completed an online questionnaire exploring beliefs and attitudes towards MARA. Results Those who reported <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> were more likely to be involved in an incident of MARA. In addition, those who were involved in MARA had higher levels of trait aggression, concern for social honour and expected positive consequences of aggression in bars than did those without such involvement. The relationship between socially constructed masculinity factors (a combined variable reflecting masculinity, social honour and expected positive consequences) and MARA was mediated by <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking.</b> Social honour accounted for almost all of the predictive power of masculinity factors. <b>Heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> and trait aggression remained significant predictors of MARA in a multivariate model.

The alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT) and self-reported ethanol intake in the last 28 days were assessed. In addition to gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulphate (EtS) were determined in serum and urine (UEtG, UEtS, SEtG) using liquid chromatography/tandem mass-spectroscopy (LC/MS-MS) with deuterated internal standards.

40|$|Most {{evidence}} on the motives-alcohol use link has come from cross-sectional research using retrospective assessments. It remains also to be demonstrated whether motives predict drinking in particular circumstances. In the present study, drinking motives assessed 2 weeks prior to a diary study were used to predict the number of drinks on weekend days as reported via short message service (SMS). Multi-level regression models were estimated based on 391 reports from 55 participants (mean age 22. 7). The results revealed that enhancement motives but not gender, age, or social, coping, or conformity motives predicted weekend drinking over and above usual consumption. Consumption and motives together explained {{more than three-quarters of}} the inter-individual variance in weekend drinking. To conclude, this study points to a <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> weekend <b>drinking</b> culture of young people who drink large quantities on Friday and Saturday nights apparently because they are seeking fun and excitement. Preventive measures should aim to counteract young people's drinking at peak times and in high-risk situations...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{describe}} {{and discuss the}} alcohol drinking patterns {{of the younger generation}} of hospital doctors in Norway and Germany – respectively the abstainers, frequent drinkers, <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> drinkers and hazardous drinkers. Methods: Data were collected in nationwide postal surveys among doctors in Norway (2000) and Germany (2006). A representative sample of 1898 German and 602 Norwegian hospital doctors aged 27 – 65 years were included in the analyses (N= 2500). Alcohol drinking patterns were measured using the first three items of AUDIT in Norway and the AUDIT-C in Germany, scores of ≥ 5 (ranking from 0 to 12) indicating hazardous <b>drinking.</b> <b>Episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> was defined by the intake of ≥ 60 g of ethanol, on one occasion, at least once a week. Frequent drinkers were who drank alcoholic beverages at least twice a week. Abstainers were persons who drank no alcohol. The analyses were performed separately for age groups (27 – 44 years versus 45 – 65 years) and genders. Results: Compared to the age groups 45 to 65 years in the Norwegian and German samples, the younger age groups (27 – 44 years) tend to have higher rates of abstainers, higher rates of infrequent drinking of moderate amount of alcoholic drinks, lower rates of <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> and lower rates of hazardous drinking. Conclusion: The younger generation of hospital doctors in Norway and Germany showed tendencies to healthier drinking habits. Changes in professional life, and in the attitude towards alcohol consumption, may go some way towards explaining these findings...|$|R

This analysis identified correlates of typical week drunkenness and past 30 -day <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> within a sample of immigrant Latino men in rural North Carolina (n = 258). In the bivariate analyses, Mexican birth, entering the United States as an adult, and year-round employment were associated with increased odds of typical week drunkenness, and higher acculturation and affiliation with a religion with strict prohibitions against drinking alcohol were associated with lower odds of typical week drunkenness. Being older, Mexican birth, entering the United States as an adult, and lower acculturation were associated with increased odds of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> and affiliation with a religion with strict prohibitions against drinking alcohol and completing high school were associated with decreased odds of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking.</b> In multivariable modeling, only religious affiliation was associated with typical week drunkenness. Mexican birth, entering the United States as an adult, and lower acculturation were associated with increased odds of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> and affiliation with a religion with strict prohibitions against drinking alcohol and completing high school were associated with lower odds of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking.</b> The health of minority men in the United States has been neglected, and immigrant Latino men comprise a particularly vulnerable population. This analysis provides initial data on some factors associated with heavy drinking within a population about which little is known.

40|$|Objectives The {{current study}} had two aims. First, {{to develop a}} moral {{disengagement}} scale contextualized to underage drinking. Second, to investigate Bandura’s (1986) self-regulatory model {{within the context of}} underage drinking. Method Two different samples of students participated in the study. The first sample included 619 (362 females) adolescents (Mage = 15. 3 years, SD = 1. 09 years) and the second sample 636 (386 females) adolescents (Mage = 15. 3 years, SD = 1. 03 years). Students in the first sample completed the Underage Drinking Disengagement Scale (UDDS), and measures of engagement in underage drinking and <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking.</b> Students in the second sample completed these measures as well as scales of general moral disengagement, personal standards and anticipatory guilt associated with underage drinking. Results For the UDDS, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses verified a single factor structure. The UDDS was more strongly associated with engagement in underage drinking and <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> than a general measure of moral disengagement. A moderated mediation analysis revealed that adolescents who negatively evaluated underage drinking reported more anticipatory guilt, and more anticipatory guilt was associated with less engagement in underage drinking and less <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking.</b> This relationship was weaker at high compared to low levels of underage drinking disengagement. Conclusions/Importance Understanding how adolescents self-regulate their drinking, and ways that such self-regulation may be deactivated or disengaged, may help identify those adolescents at increased risk of drinking underage and of engaging in <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background Alcohol use, {{especially}} <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> at {{an early}} age has been associated with various problems (e. g. risky sexual behaviours, health problems, depression, and heavy alcohol consumption at a later age). Thus, {{a better understanding of the}} risk and protective factors that influence adolescent alcohol use is crucial to developing effective prevention strategies. The aim of this thesis is to examine the importance of risk and protective factors in the development of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> and subsequent problems for adolescent boys and girls. In addition, the prevention paradox (most alcohol-related problems occur in the 90 % of the population with lowest alcohol consumption) was examined among adolescents in Sweden and Europe. Methods Data from three different questionnaire studies were analysed: (1) a longitudinal cohort study with 1222 adolescents from Stockholm, aged 13 to 19 years, (2) a cross-sectional study with 3000 adolescents aged 15 years and 17 years from random samples of school classes throughout the whole of Sweden, and (3) a cross-sectional study (the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs, ESPAD) performed in 35 countries among students who turned 16 during the year of the data collection. Twenty-three countries with 38 370 alcohol-consuming adolescents were included. Results Smoking and peer alcohol use were strongly associated with heavy drinking among both boys and girls, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Some gender differences were found; parental provision of alcohol in the 7 th grade increased the odds for heavy alcohol use in girls two years later, and truancy was associated with later heavy alcohol use in boys. For boys, <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> at age 13 was one of the most distinct predictors of later <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking.</b> For girls, secure bonds to parents lowered the risk for <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> even if the girls had friends who drank alcohol, money to spend, or parents who offered them alcohol. For boys whose parents offered them alcohol, parental monitoring had a protective effect. Also, we found that adolescents on a consistent high alcohol use trajectory during early adolescence had higher levels of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> and alcohol-related problems at age 19. Furthermore, the prevention paradox was valid for adolescent boys and girls in Sweden and in most European countries; despite differences in annual alcohol consumption, levels of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> and reported problems, the heavy episodic drinkers in the bottom 90 % consumer group accounted for a majority of all reported problems. Conclusions Effective population strategies may have large potential to reduce risk drinking and the overall problem level. A comprehensive prevention strategy should nevertheless also include efforts to reach adolescent high consumers. Furthermore, our results lend support to prevention initiatives to strengthen the parent–child relationship, to focus on adolescents‟ ability to resist peer pressure, and to limit parental provision of alcohol...|$|E
40|$|Research has {{documented}} that <b>Episodic</b> <b>Heavy</b> <b>Drinking</b> (EHD), defined as consuming {{four or more}} and five or more alcoholic drinks per drinking episode among females and males, respectively, is a prevalent risk behavior among undergraduate college students throughout the United States. Moreover, {{studies have shown that}} EHD {{is the leading cause of}} preventable morbidity and mortality among college students as unintentional injuries, sexual assaults, and unsafe sexual behaviors among this population have been linked to this risk behavior. Illicit substance use, although often portrayed as a separate risk behavior, is also associated with EHD. Nationally, the most frequently used illicit substance among college students is marijuana. Research suggests that college students who engage in EHD are several times more likely to be current marijuana users or to have used marijuana during their lifetime. Furthermore, EHD has been identified as a predictor of marijuana use and other substances, illicit or otherwise. With regard to this particular investigation, three specific risk behaviors among undergraduate students at Western Kentucky University (WKU) were the primary foci: 1) the prevalence of alcohol use and <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> (EHD), 2) the prevalence of illicit substance use, particularly marijuana use, and 3) concomitant EHD and marijuana use. In addition, WKU students 2 ̆ 7 personal characteristics and certain behaviors were examined to determine their association with alcohol and marijuana use. This study was a secondary analysis of data gathered through the Western Kentucky Student Health Assessment (WKU-SHA 2002) administered during the fall semester of 2002.

We aimed to assess the role of individual and neighbourhood characteristics in a cross-sectional, nationwide, multilevel study. Individual data of 30, 117 Dutch adults, living in 1722 neighbourhoods across the Netherlands, were obtained from the 2004 to 2009 national health survey (POLS). Chronic heavy alcohol consumption was measured as ≥ 14 drinks/week for women and ≥ 21 for men, and <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> as ≥ 6 drinks/day at least once a week. Neighbourhood deprivation was dichotomous; deprived districts as selected by the Dutch government versus other areas. Multilevel logistic regression models of the association between deprivation and heavy drinking were corrected for age, gender, household composition, population density and potential predictors ethnicity, socioeconomic status (education, income), neighbourhood-level social cohesion and percentage Muslims. The prevalence of heavy drinking was lower in deprived neighbourhoods than {{in the rest of the}} Netherlands.

Adding ethnicity to the model reduced these associations by approximately one half. Socioeconomic composition did not contribute to the relationship. The proportion of Muslims explained a small part, while social cohesion explained even less of the association. Stronger associations were observed for women and older adults than for men and younger adults.

40|$|Background: The {{association}} {{of social capital}} and alcohol consumption {{is one of the}} most robust empirical findings in health economics of the past decade. However, the direction of the relationship between the two is heavily dependent on which dimension of social capital is studied and which alcohol measure is used. In this paper, we examine the effect of social interactions and generalised trust on drinking in the general Danish population survey. Methods: Participants (n = 2569) were recruited as part of a larger study. The double-hurdle model for the volume of alcohol consumption and the multivariate logistic model for <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> were estimated. Results: We found evidence that social networking with male friends, membership in voluntary organisations, and generalised trust were significantly associated with the mean volume of alcohol consumption and heavy drinking. We also observed that social support at the community level had a buffering effect against <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking.</b> Conclusions: The findings support previous findings in which social interactions and generalised trust were found to predict individuals' volume of drinking and <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking.</b> However, the results varied across the indicators...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Alcohol use and misuse {{and their}} {{relation}} to sociodemograhic factors are well studied among university students in Western European countries and the USA, but less is known about students in Eastern Europe. The historical past as communistic countries might have affected the social life among these populations, which is again {{one of the main}} factors determining the alcohol consumption among university students. The aim of our study was to assess the association of selected sociodemographic factors with different patterns of alcohol use among university students in Slovakia. METHODS: A sample of 813 young adults (mean age 21. 1 years, 63. 8 % females; response rate of 71 %) from four universities in Kosice answered questions about their sociodemographic background and about alcohol use. To obtain a detailed picture of different aspects, alcohol use was measured by four variables: frequency of alcohol use, <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> frequency of drunkenness and problem drinking. Four separate logistic regression models were used to assess the association between sociodemographic and alcohol-related variables. To assess the potentially different effects in both genders, all two-way interactions with gender were tested. RESULTS: While 41 % of the students drank alcohol once a week or more often, 77 % reported <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> and 49 % had been drunk more than once in the last month. Problem drinking existed in 23. 3 % of the sample. Gender was consistently associated with all four alcohol-related variables, with males being at higher risk. A higher study year was associated only with lower levels of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> but displayed no association with the other studied variables. Living with parents during the semester was consistently associated with less frequent <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> drunkenness episodes, and problem drinking while having an intimate relationship was associated with less problem drinking only. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings for the university students from Slovakia are in line with previous studies in Western Europe. Additionally, it appears that frequent alcohol use, excessive alcohol use (<b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> and drunkenness) and problem drinking among university students represent a continuum and are influenced by the same sociodemographic factors. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the associations between depressive symptoms and four indicators of alcohol consumption (high frequency of drinking, frequency of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> problem drinking, and possible alcohol dependence). We also explored whether personal importance of religious faith {{as well as}} healthy lifestyle had any modifying roles in these relationships. During 2007 - 2008, 3, 220 students at seven UK universities completed a questionnaire containing questions on CAGE, frequency alcohol use, <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> modified Beck-Depression Inventory, physical activity and sleep, and importance of religious faith. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed separately for four alcohol consumption indicators, stratified by gender. Controlling for demographic variables, depressive symptoms were positively associated with problem drinking and possible alcohol dependence for both genders. Religiosity was negatively associated with frequency of drinking and <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> among both genders, while healthy lifestyle {{was not associated with}} any of the four measures of alcohol consumption among both genders. No evidence suggested that either religiosity or healthy lifestyle modified the relationships between depressive symptoms and any of the four measures of alcohol consumption. This study shows a link between hazardous drinking and mental ill health and suggests religiosity as a protective factor for high alcohol consumption. Promotion of students' mental and spiritual health could have a preventive role in hazardous drinking at universities...|$|E
40|$|The {{evidence}} on alcohol use disorder among conflict-affected civilian populations remains extremely weak, despite {{a number of}} potential risk-factors. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine patterns of alcohol use disorder among conflict-affected persons in the Republic of Georgia. A cross-sectional survey of 3600 randomly selected internally displaced persons (IDPs) and former IDPs. Two alcohol use disorder outcomes were measured: (i) having at least hazardous alcohol use (AUDIT score ≥ 8); (ii) <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> (consuming > 60 grams of pure alcohol per drinking session at least once a week). Individual level demographic and socio-economic characteristics were also recorded, including mental disorders. Community level alcohol environment characteristics relating to alcohol availability, marketing and pricing were recorded in the respondents' communities and a factor analysis conducted to produce a summary alcohol environment factor score. Logistic regression analyses examined associations between individual and community level factors with the alcohol use disorder outcomes (among men only). Of the total sample, 71 % of men and 16 % of women were current drinkers. Of the current drinkers (N = 1386), 28 % of men and 1 % of women were classified as having at least hazardous alcohol use; and 12 % of men and 2 % of women as <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> drinkers. Individual characteristics significantly associated with both outcomes were age and experiencing a serious injury, while cumulative trauma events and depression were also associated with having at least hazardous alcohol use. For the community level analysis, a one unit increase in the alcohol environment factor was associated with a 1. 27 fold increase in <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> among men (no significant association with hazardous alcohol use). The findings suggest potential synergies for treatment responses for alcohol use disorder and depression among conflict-affected populations in Georgia, as well as the need for stronger alcohol control policies in Georgia...|$|R
40|$|Although {{many studies}} have {{addressed}} adverse outcomes in children of parents with alcohol abuse/dependence, less {{is known about the}} possible long-term effects of more normative patterns of parental alcohol consumption, including drinking at lower risk levels and <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> or binge <b>drinking.</b> The extent of harm from parental drinking may therefore be underestimated. With this research proposal, we describe a project that aims to assess possible long-term adverse effects of parental drinking by combining survey and nationwide registry data. Advantages of a longitudinal general population cohort design include that it allows for detailed information on parental drinking through survey data and identification of possible negative long-term health and social outcomes from exposure to parental drinking 1 – 19 years after exposure through continuously updated nationwide registers. The rich information available from combining survey and registry data allows us to take into account important confounders, mediators, and moderators...|$|R

40|$|Aims: We {{examined}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> in general practice attenders who were non-hazardous drinkers, the associated risk factors and the outcome over 6 months. Methods: Consecutive attenders aged 18 - 75 were recruited from the UK, Spain, Slovenia, Estonia, the Netherlands and Portugal and followed up after 6 months. Data were collected on alcohol use using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification test (at recruitment and 6 months) and risk factors for heavy episodic alcohol use at recruitment. Results: The prevalence of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> in non-hazardous drinkers was 4. 5 % across Europe [lowest in Portugal (1. 5 %); highest Netherlands (8. 4 %) ]. It was less frequent in Spain, Slovenia, Estonia and Portugal compared with the UK and Netherlands. It was higher in men [odd ratio (OR) 4. 4, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 3, 5. 9], people between 18 and 29 years of age, those employed (OR 1. 8, 95 % CI 1. 3, 2. 6) and those using recreational drugs (OR 2. 1, 95 % CI 1. 4, 3. 3). It was lower in people with existing DSMIV major depression (OR 0. 54, 95 % CI 0. 31, 0. 96). Heavy episodic drinkers {{were more likely to}} become hazardous drinkers at 6 months (male: OR 7. 2, 95 % CI 4. 1, 12. 7; female: OR 9. 4, 95 % CI 4. 3, 20. 6). Conclusion : Women and men in the UK, men in the Netherlands and younger people in all countries are at the greatest risk of exhibiting <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> behaviours {{even in the absence of}} hazardous alcohol use. There is hence an urgent need for general practitioners to consider early detection and management of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> behaviour in this population...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{association}} between <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> (HED) and deliberate self-harm (DSH) in young people in Norway. We analysed data on past-year HED and DSH from the second (1994) and third (1999) waves of the Young in Norway Longitudinal Study (cumulative response rate: 68. 1 %, n[*]=[*] 2647). Associations between HED and DSH were obtained as odds ratios and population-attributable fractions (PAF) applying fixed-effects modelling, which eliminates the effects of time-invariant confounders. An increase in HED was associated {{with an increase in}} risk of DSH (OR[*]=[*] 1. 64, P[*]=[*] 0. 013), after controlling for time-varying confounders. The estimated PAF was 28 % from fixed-effects modelling and 51 % from conventional modelling.

40|$|Background: <b>Heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> ("binge") <b>drinking</b> {{of alcohol}} has serious public health implications, {{especially}} for youth and young adults. Previous summaries and surveys {{have failed to}} address in a comprehensive manner the effects of alcohol prices on binge drinking by gender or age group. Methods: A qualitative systematic review is performed for effects of alcohol prices (or tax surrogates) on binge drinking for three age groups: youth, young adults, and adults. Outcomes examined include binge participation, intensity and frequency. Criteria for data collection and potential sources of bias are discussed, including adequacy of price data. Price-binge relationships are judged using a 95 % confidence interval (p. 0. 05) for statistical significance. Results: Fifty-six relevant econometric studies were found, with studies and results distributed equally among three age groups. Also found were five natural experiments for tax reductions and six field studies. Null results or mixed results are found {{in more than half}} of the studies. The body of evidence indicates that binge drinkers are not highly-responsive to increased prices. Non-responsiveness holds generally for younger and older drinkers and for male and female binge drinkers alike. A limitation of the current literature is that results are only available for higher-income countries. Conclusions: Increased alcohol taxes or prices are unlikely to be effective as a means to reduce binge drinking, regardless of gender or age group...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} {{from high school}} to college is a high-risk stage for the initiation and escalation of substance use. Substance use and its associated risk factors have been thoroughly described in developed countries, such as the United States, but largely neglected in Argentina, a South American country with patterns of a collectivist culture. The present cross-sectional study describes the occurrence of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use and the association between these behaviors and the age of onset of substance use and cognitive (i. e., risk perception) and social (i. e., prescriptive) variables in a large sample of Argentinean college freshmen (n = 4083, 40. 1 % men; mean age = 19. 39 ± 2. 18 years). The response rate across courses was ≥ 90 % and was similarly distributed across sex. Participants completed a survey that measured substance use (alcohol [with a focus on heavy drinking and binge drinking behaviors], tobacco, and marijuana), age of onset of the use of each substance, perceived risk associated with various substance use behaviors, prescriptive norms associated with substance use, and descriptive norms for alcohol use (AU). The results indicated that AU is nearly normative (90. 4 and 80. 3 % with last year and last month use, respectively) in this population, and heavy drinking is highly prevalent (68. 6 and 54. 9 % with <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> and binge <b>drinking,</b> respectively), especially among those with an early drinking onset (97. 8 and 93. 6 % with last year and last month use and 87. 8 and 76. 3 % with <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> and binge <b>drinking,</b> respectively). The last-year occurrence of tobacco and marijuana use was 36 and 28 %, respectively. Early substance use was associated with the greater use of that specific substance. The students overestimated their same-sex friend’s AU, and women overestimated the level of AU of their best male friend. At the multivariate level, all of the predictors, {{with the exception of the}} parents’ prescriptive norms, significantly explained the frequency of marijuana and tobacco use and frequency of hazardous drinking. Overall, despite important cultural and contextual differences between Argentina and the United States, our findings suggest that certain vulnerability factors have a similar influence across these cultural contexts...|$|R
40|$|Background: In New Zealand {{and other}} middle to high income countries, {{university}} student {{are at high}} risk of alcohol-related injury and other problems due to their typical pattern of <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking.</b> In 2007, one university implemented Campus Watch, a novel and extensive programme to reduce social disorder, including alcohol-related injury, in the university area. Objectives: To quantify the effects of this complex intervention. Setting: A large public university campus and surrounding community in New Zealand. Design: A health promotion evaluation model was used, examining: (1) how the programme was developed, introduced and received by the community? (process); (2) whether the programme affected behaviour? (impact); and (3) whether the programme reduced social disorder and alcohol-related harm in particular? (outcome). The outcome phase uses a non-equivalent control group design to measure changes occurring in the Campus Watch area compared with other universities, and with a same-city control site. Participants: Programme staff, university students and other community members. Data: Interviews with university administrators and Campus Watch staff; surveys of local residents' views; Campus Watch incident data; national surveys of university students in 2005, 2007 and 2009; police data; fire department data. Outcome Measures: Prevalence of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> drinking; number of acute alcohol-related harms; incidence of antisocial behaviour, assault and street fires. Analysis: Regression analyses will be used to examine changes in the intervention site relative to changes in the control areas...|$|R
