40|$|This study {{examined}} the factors influencing dairy farmers´ decisions to invest in automated milking systems (AMS). The problem studied involves uncertainty, information and complexity for dairy farmers in specific decision contexts. The frame of reference in the thesis combines contingency theory and decision theory and is used in a qualitative analysis of a set interview with dairy farmers who have recently bought an AMS and salespersons from Delaval, one of the AMS suppliers. The {{aim of this study}} is to develop an understanding of the decision making processes of dairy farmers, and in particular to identify which types of factors influence the outcome of an investment decision in the technological development of a farm. The study uses Thompsons` (1967) theory about the structure that organizations develop to handle the input of information. Thus, interest is focused on how a farm business structure handles information in the AMS decision, investigating the differences in information with Delaval’s "feed first principle" system and Lely’s "free cow traffic" system. The results of the qualitative interviews with the dairy farmers who bought an AMS show that there are three important factors that influence the outcome: employees, suppliers and the owner. Results of the qualitative interviews with the salespersons show that the salespersons are aware of the factors that are important to the farmers. Of the three main factors influencing the outcome of the decision, the role of employees was particularly evident. An employee milking cows is perceived to require more resources than an AMS. Having employees is costly, so the dairy farmer is interested in developing his operation into a more cost-efficient operation. Lely’s <b>free-feed</b> system does not have a specific order in which cows have to proceed, but with Delaval’s feed first principle there are specific orders that must be followed. Thompson’s theory suggests that this will lead to differences in how the organizations are structured, whereas in the case of Delaval, the dairy farmer must contend with more information than he does in the case of Lely. The study concludes that farmers have different relations with the suppliers in the market, and that farmers believe in different milking systems. These factors influence the decisions made by farmers, which in turn effect change to the structure of organization. In the end, it comes down to a question of the system in which the farmer believes : either it will be necessary to handle more information in a more complex organization or handle less information in a less complex organization. Delaval’s salespersons are well aware of the factors that influence the farmer’s decision to invest in an AMS, but perhaps do not fully recognize why farmers choose the specific AMS system...|$|E

Then a dose of cocaine that initially decreased response rates by more than 95 % of control rates was administered before each daily session. Comparable degrees of tolerance to these rate-decreasing effects developed in the two groups. The rate at which responding recovered was relatively rapid for pigeons in the 70 % free-feeding-weight group and was slower for 2 of the 3 pigeons in the 90 % free-feeding-weight group. When body weights were then increased from 70 % to 80 % or were decreased from 90 % to 80 % of <b>free-feeding</b> weight, performance was disrupted initially only for pigeons whose weight went from 70 % to 80 % of free feeding.

40|$|The present {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine whether the modification of the effects of morphine by food deprivation would occur under conditions of strong stimulus control. Four pigeons pecked response keys under a multiple fixed-interval (FI) 5 -min and clocked fixed-interval (CFI) 5 -min schedule of food presentation. During the FI component, the key was lit green and the house light was on throughout. During the CFI component, the key light and house light settings changed in a regular manner as the interval elapsed. In all conditions, pigeons received a range of doses of morphine (1. 0 - 10. 0 mg/kg) and saline. In the first condition, pigeons were maintained at 80 % of their <b>free-feeding</b> weights. When calculated over entire 5 -min intervals, morphine produced dose-dependent decreases in the index of curvature (a measure of temporal patterning) during the FI component, but did not affect the index of curvature during the CFI component. A more detailed analysis revealed that the index of curvature during the last stimulus in the CFI sequence was reduced in a dose-dependent manner, similar to the effects obtained for the entire FI component. When the pigeons were maintained at 70 % and 90 % of their <b>free-feeding</b> weights, measures of the effects of morphine on temporal patterning did not differ as a function of body weight. The effects of morphine on rates of key-pecking, however, were related to body weight. For three of four pigeons, rates of key-pecking were not suppressed until higher doses, and increases in rates of key-pecking were more common at lower doses, when the pigeons were maintained at 70 % of their <b>free-feeding</b> weights, than when they were maintained at 90 % of their <b>free-feeding</b> weights.

40|$|A {{corollary}} {{of the law}} {{of effect}} predicts that the larger the reinforcement, the greater the rate of responding. However, an animal must eat more small portions than large portions to obtain the same daily intake, and one would predict, therefore, that when eating smaller portions an efficient animal would eat less (conserving time and energy) and/or respond faster (conserving time). The latter of these predictions was supported by the present experiments with <b>free-feeding</b> rats for which portion size (pellet size or duration of feeder presentation) and portion price within meals were varied. Response rate was a function of the unit price (responses/g) of food: Rats responded faster when portions were smaller or when prices were higher.

To investigate the mechanism by which simmondsin reduces food intake, fasted and <b>free-feeding</b> rats were given simmondsin-supplemented food and simultaneously injected with devazepide, a specific antagonist of peripheral-type cholecystokinin receptors (CCKA receptors). In <b>free-feeding</b> rats, supplementation of food with 0. 5 % simmondsin caused a reduction in food intake of +/- 40 % {{in the period of}} 4 h following food presentation. Intraperitoneal injection of 100 micrograms devazepide/kg body weight prevented this effect. In rats fasted for 20 h, the food intake in the 30 min after presentation of food supplemented with 0. 15 % or 0. 50 % simmondsin was reduced in a dose-related manner; this was also inhibited by simultaneous application of devazepide. It is suggested that peripheral CCKA receptors are involved in the effect of simmondsin on food intake.

40|$|AbstractThe {{postprandial}} event {{known as}} the specific dynamic action is an evolutionarily conserved physiological set of metabolic responses to feeding. Its behavioral counterpart, a sequence of drinking, maintenance (e. g., grooming) and sleep-like behaviors {{known as the}} behavioral satiety sequence (BSS), has been thoroughly described in rodents and has enabled the refined evaluation of potential appetite modifiers. However, the presence and attributes of a BSS have not been systematically studied in non-mammalian species. Here, we describe the BSS induced in pigeons (Columba livia) by 1) the presentation of a palatable seed mixture (SM) food to <b>free-feeding</b> animals (SM+FF condition) and 2) re-feeding after a 24 -h fasting period (FD 24 h+SM), which was examined by continuous behavioral recording for 2 h. We then compare these patterns to those observed in <b>free-feeding</b> (FF) animals. A set of graphic representations and indexes, drawn from these behaviors (latency, time-to-peak, inter-peak intervals and the first intersection between feeding curves {{and those of other}} BSS-typical behaviors) were used to describe the temporal structure and sequential relationships between the pigeon's BSS components. Cramér–von Mises-based statistical procedures and bootstrapping-based methods to compare pairs of complex behavioral curves were described and used for comparisons among the behavioral profiles during the <b>free-feeding</b> recordings and after fasting- and SM-induced BSS. FD 24 h+SM- and SM+FF-induced feeding were consistently followed by a similar sequence of increased bouts of drinking, followed by preening and then sleep, which were significantly different from that of FF birds. The sequential and temporal patterns of the pigeon's BSS were not affected by differences in food intake or by dissimilarity in motivational content of feeding stimuli. The present data indicated that a BSS pattern can be reliably evoked in the pigeon, in a chronological succession and sequence that strongly resembled that observed in rodents and primates. This pattern can be quantitatively described and compared using different suitable and coordinated behavioral measures, enabling further studies on the comparative and evolutionary aspects of the mechanisms that shape the post-consummatory behavioral flux in amniotes...|$|R

Cannabinoid receptors have proven an efficient target to suppress hunger and weight gain by their pharmacological inactivation. A standard fasted protocol and a novel long-term home-cage observation system with <b>free-feeding</b> animals were used to assess the feeding behaviour of mice treated with the CB(1) antagonist AM 251. Similarly, the effects of the phytocannabinoid Delta(9) -tetrahydrocannabivarin (Delta(9) -THCV), which behaves like a CB(1) antagonist, were also determined in <b>free-feeding</b> animals. AM 251 suppressed food intake and weight gain in fasted and non-fasted animals.

Pure Delta(9) -THCV also induced hypophagia and weight reduction at doses as low as 3 mg. kg(- 1). No rebound was observed on the following day with all drug groups returning to normal activity and feeding regimes. However, a Delta(9) -THCV-rich cannabis-extract failed to suppress food intake and weight gain, possibly due to residual Delta(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9) -THC) in the extract.

40|$|Both {{olanzapine}} and sibutramine target serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission {{and influence}} body weight, but in opposite ways. The second-generation antipsychotic olanzapine, an antagonist at serotonergic and noradrenergic receptors, frequently induces weight gain as a side-effect, whereas sibutramine, a noradrenaline/serotonin reuptake inhibitor, {{is known as}} a weight-reducing agent. To investigate whether altered motivation for palatable food influences the effect of these drugs on body weight, we determined their effects on responding for sucrose pellets under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement in rats. We found that a low dose of olanzapine selectively increased responding to sucrose, without affecting <b>free-feeding</b> intake of sucrose. In contrast, sibutramine dose-dependently reduced responding to sucrose and similarly reduced <b>free-feeding</b> intake. Furthermore, coadministration of a dose of sibutramine that failed to affect responding to sucrose when administered alone prevented the increase in motivation by the effective dose of olanzapine. These data show that increased motivation for palatable food {{is likely to be a}} significant contributor to olanzapine-induced weight gain. Moreover, the ability of sibutramine to reduce this motivation for palatable food may play an important role in the efficacy of sibutramine as an add-on treatment to counteract olanzapine-induced weight gain.

Thus, there are very few efficacious drugs available and remains a great unmet medical need for anti-obesity drugs that increase energy expenditure by acting on peripheral tissues without severe side effects. Here, we report a novel approach involving antisense inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR 4) in peripheral tissues. Treatment of diet-induce obese (DIO) mice with FGFR 4 antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) specifically reduced liver FGFR 4 expression that not only resulted in decrease in body weight (BW) and adiposity in <b>free-feeding</b> conditions, but also lowered BW and adiposity under caloric restriction.

In our study, methyl donor deficient diet and chronic stress condition consisted respectively of a B 2, B 9, B 12, and choline-free diet and a chronic mild stress procedure. Rats {{were randomly assigned to}} six groups with three "diet" conditions (<b>free-feeding,</b> pair-fed and methyl donor deficient diet) and two "stress" conditions (no-stress and stress) and were evaluated in the open-field, the elevated plus-maze and the forced swimming test. After the behavioral evaluation, corticosterone and homocysteine plasma levels were measured and dopamine, DOPAC, serotonin, 5 HIAA concentrations were evaluated in several brain areas. Rats given a methyl donor deficient diet for 11 weeks causing elevated plasma homocysteine levels were compared to pair-fed and <b>free-feeding</b> rats with or without unpredictable chronic mild stress. Regardless of stress environmental conditions, the methyl donor deficient diet decreased plasma corticosterone levels and caused disinhibition in the elevated plus-maze condition relative to both control groups. However, stress potentiated the effects of the deficient regimen on rearing in the open-field and climbing in the forced swim test. The dietary changes involved in behavior and plasma corticosterone could be caused by homocysteine-induced decreases in dopamine and 5 -hydroxytryptamine metabolites in selective brain regions and it can be noted that regardless of stress-conditions, methyl donor deficient diet decreases DOPAC/dopamine and 5 HIAA/serotonin ratios in striatum and hypothalamus and selectively 5 HIAA/serotonin ratio in the sensorimotor cortex. Our experimental data is particularly relevant in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders frequently associated with folate deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the dioxin-like PCB 126 (3, 3 ¿, 4, 4 ¿, 5 -pentachlorobiphenyl) on the early {{development}} of the marine flatfish sole (Solea solea) was tested in a newly developed early life stage (ELS) test that includes the metamorphosis of the symmetric larvae into an asymmetrical flatfish. Early life stages of sole were exposed to a concentration series of PCB 126 in seawater until 4, 8, 10 and 15 days post fertilisation (dpf). Subsequently {{the development of the}} larvae was registered under further unexposed conditions. The LC 50 s {{at the start of the}} <b>free-feeding</b> stage (12 dpf) ranged between 39 and 83 ng PCB 126 /l depending on exposure duration. After the fish had completed the metamorphosis, the LC 50 values ranged between 1. 7 and 3. 7 ng PCB 126 /l for the groups exposed for 4, 8 and 10 dpf, respectively. Thus exposure for only 4 days, covering only the egg stage, was sufficient to cause adverse effects during a critical developmental phase two weeks later. The internal dosages of these larvae, determined by means of an in vitro gene reporter assay as dioxin-equivalent values (TEQ), revealed a LD 50 of 1 ng TEQ/g lipid, which is within the same order of magnitude as TEQ levels found in fish from highly polluted areas. This study indicates that ELS fish tests that are terminated shortly after the fish becomes <b>free-feeding,</b> underestimate the toxic potential of compounds with low acute toxicity such as PCBs. Our prolonged ELS with this native marine flatfish suggests that reproductive success of fish populations at contaminated sites can be affecte...|$|R
40|$|Behavior {{maintained}} by stimulus-reinforcer pairings was examined. Guinea pigs maintained at 85 per cent of <b>free-feeding</b> weights reliably contacted a retractable lever presented before {{delivery of a}} single piece of guinea-pig chow or a 45 -milligram guinea-pig pellet. When animals were given free access to one food and received the second food preceded by the lever, contact responses persisted. Such responses seldom occurred when a single food was freely available and was also delivered after lever presentation. Introduction of an omission training (negative automaintenance) procedure, in which lever contacts resulted in lever retraction and prevented food delivery, strongly reduced lever contacts. Observation indicated that mouthing the food cup, instead of the lever, became the prominent behavior during the prefood stimulus under the omission training procedure...|$|R
40|$|Using a color-tracking {{procedure}} with responses reinforced under a second-order schedule, the discriminative-stimulus properties of phencyclidine were studied in pigeons maintained at 70 %, 80 %, or 90 % of their <b>free-feeding</b> weights. The generalization curves for phencyclidine were similar {{at all three}} body weights. Generalization curves for pentobarbital, d-amphetamine, and saline were also unrelated to body weight. These data suggest that food deprivation may not influence the discriminative-stimulus properties of drugs {{in the way that}} it influences the reinforcing-stimulus properties of drugs. The reason may be that during discrimination training interoceptive stimuli resulting from food deprivation do not become conditioned to the stimulus properties of the drug, because the food-deprivation stimuli are paired equally often with the presence and absence of drug stimuli...|$|R
40|$|The discriminative {{stimulus}} {{effects of}} dopamine (DA) D 3 /D 2 receptor agonists {{are thought to}} be mediated by D 2 receptors. To maintain responding, access to food is often restricted, which can alter neurochemical and behavioral effects of drugs acting on DA systems. This study established stimulus control with quinpirole in <b>free-feeding</b> rats and tested the ability of agonists to mimic and antagonists to attenuate the effects of quinpirole. The same antagonists were studied for their ability to attenuate quinpirole-induced yawning and hypothermia. DA receptor agonists apomorphine and lisuride, but not amphet-amine and morphine, occasioned responding on the quinpirole lever. The discriminative stimulus effects of quinpirole were attenuated by the D 3 receptor-selective antagonist N-{ 4 -[4 -(2, 3 -dichlorophenyl) -piperazin- 1 -yl]-trans-but- 2 -enyl}- 4...|$|R
