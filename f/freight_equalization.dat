50|$|During {{the period}} 2005 to 2009, {{he was the}} Minister of Heavy Industry and Public Enterprises in the Union Cabinet. His tenure saw the {{fruition}} of a comprehensive automotive policy that will shape the Indian auto industry in the decades to come. This period also saw the rationalisation of Public sector wages. this brought employees of government run companies closer to the levels of their private counterparts and drastically reduced the exodus of talented managers and executives. His other salient achievements include, the deregulation of steel in the mid 1990s as minister of steel which unshackled potential of the indigenous steel industry making India a global steel powerhouse. He was also instrumental in setting up a national university in Silchar, Assam. He {{played a key role}} in the <b>freight</b> <b>equalization</b> scheme in the early 1990s in India which removed unequal rail freight charges among the states, thereby making them more competitive.|$|E
40|$|An {{examination}} {{based on}} stochastic plant location analysis {{was made of}} organizational efficiency in the Queensland cattle slaughtering industry. Short-run models were used to highlight forces influencing commodity flows and plant utilization levels in the industry. These models were also used to explore effects of <b>freight</b> <b>equalization</b> arrangements. <b>Freight</b> <b>equalization</b> was found to involve annual costs of resource misallocation {{of the order of}} $ 1 million. Potential efficiency gains through improved plant locations and sizes were also estimated and found to be at least $ 4. 4 million. Agribusiness,...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{three cases}} in which trade in natural resources and other raw materials can inform us about wider questions of economic development. The first chapter, “Capturing the Value Chain: The Persistence of Trade Policy in China After WTO Accession”, considers whether in the GATT/WTO era, developing countries are still able to actively conduct trade policy. In this study, I show that after China’s entry into WTO, required import tariff reductions on downstream sectors have been partly offset by an alternative policy with similar effects: export restrictions on raw materials. I also find that larger rises in Chinese raw materials export taxes after WTO accession {{have been associated with}} greater downstream export growth. The second chapter, “Winners and Losers from a Commodities-for-Manufactures Trade Boom”, examines two contrasting outcomes of the ‘de-industrialization’ associated with rising trade between China and other developing countries. In particular, this chapter compares changes in labour market outcomes in Brazilian regions stimulated by rising demand from China for raw materials, with Brazilian regions whose manufacturing sectors have been harmed by Chinese import competition. While there was slower growth in manufacturing wages and greater rises in local wage inequality in ‘loser’ regions between 2000 and 2010, ‘winner’ regions experienced higher wage growth, lower takeup of cash transfers and positive effects on job quality. The third chapter,“Access to Raw Materials and Local Comparative Advantage: The Effects of India’s <b>Freight</b> <b>Equalization</b> Policy”, considers the importance of access to raw materials for industrial development. It does so by looking at the effects of a Indian policy that aimed to remove regional comparative advantages associated with proximity to raw materials, by equalizing prices of steel across India. The results suggest that in practice, this policy may have had only a limited effect on access to raw materials across Indian states...|$|E
