5|$|For many years, Bradbury was {{responsible}} {{for much of the}} administration of the town of Los Alamos. The town established impressive health and <b>education</b> <b>facilities.</b> Eventually the new technical area was built outside the town, and on 18 February 1957 the security gates were taken down. Finally, the town became an incorporated community and the director's civic responsibilities ended.|$|E
5|$|Major {{investment}} by the Indonesian government to improve East Timor's infrastructure, {{and health and}} <b>education</b> <b>facilities</b> since 1975, did not end East Timorese resistance to Indonesian rule. Although by the 1980s Fretilin forces had dropped to a few hundred armed men, Fretilin increased its contacts with young Timorese especially in Dili, and an un-armed civil resistance seeking self-determination took shape.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, Selfe became vice {{president}} of the School of Arts. He supported the school's Working Men's College, but felt a more thorough focus on practical skills was needed. He rejected the non-technical, non-practical approach of the school's model and campaigned instead {{for the establishment of a}} proper institute of technical education, where instructors would be skilled tradesmen with practical industrial experience. He also pushed for the expansion of technical <b>education</b> <b>facilities</b> into the suburban and regional districts.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} efforts to revive the Olympics, Evangelis Zappas made several philanthropic {{donations}} towards the foundation of schools, libraries and other similar institutions all over the Ottoman-occupied world, and notably their birthplace, Epirus. Greek schools were founded and expanded in several Greek-populated villages and towns, such as Labovo, Lekli, Nivani, Dhroviani, Filiates, Delvina, Permet. In Constantinople, <b>education</b> <b>facilities</b> were also founded that included nurseries, primary and secondary schools, which were collectively known as the Zappeion Institute. Moreover, {{a large amount of}} money was deposited in the National Bank of Greece to provide scholarships for Greek agricultural students in order to conduct postgraduate studies in Western Europe.|$|E

5|$|Once the {{revolution}} concluded following the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference of 1949, Soeman was recalled to Pekanbaru {{and made the}} head of the regional branch of the Department of Education and Culture. His main task was reestablishing and reinvigorating the education system in Riau following three years of the Japanese occupation and four years of revolution. Desks had been used for firewood, school buildings had been razed to prevent enemy forces from using them, and much of the population had been unable to attend regular classes. Furthermore, the department did not have sufficient funding to support reconstruction. Over the next three years Soeman led communal work projects dedicated to restoring Riau's <b>education</b> <b>facilities,</b> relying on voluntary contributions from the populace.|$|E
5|$|Selfe left Mort's in 1877 to {{practise}} as {{a consulting}} engineer at 141 Pitt Street, gaining {{a reputation for}} versatility and originality. Upon his return from an overseas trip through America, Britain and continental Europe in 1884–85, where he visited engineering works and technical <b>education</b> <b>facilities</b> in search of new ideas to take back to Sydney, Selfe {{set up a new}} office in Lloyd's Chambers at 348 George Street. He would later move to No. 279 where he operated the consultancy until his death in 1911. In the late 1890s he employed William Dixson as an engineer, who would later make a major donation of Australiana to the State Library of New South Wales. The collection of Selfe's own papers and drawings have since been donated to the same library that his former employee greatly augmented.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{hospital building}} is now largely occupied by corporate offices. The 1966 extension houses the library, art store, and document archives while the 1980s redevelopments created exhibition space over five floors. The first stage created 8,000m2 of gallery space of which 4,600m2 was new, {{and the second}} provided a further 1,600m2. The final phase, the Southwest Infill, was partly funded by a £12.6 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and provided 5,860m2 of gallery space and educational facilities over six floors. Before the 2013-14 redevelopment, the basement was occupied by permanent galleries on the First and Second World Wars, and of conflicts after 1945. The ground floor comprised the atrium, cinema, temporary exhibition spaces, and visitor facilities. The first floor included the atrium mezzanine, <b>education</b> <b>facilities,</b> and a permanent gallery, Secret War, exploring special forces, espionage and covert operations. The second floor included the atrium viewing balcony, two art galleries, a temporary exhibition area and the permanent Crimes against Humanity exhibition. The third floor housed the permanent Holocaust Exhibition, and the fourth floor, a vaulted roof space, accommodated the Lord Ashcroft Gallery. Opened in November 2010 the gallery exhibits the museum's Victoria Cross (VC) and George Cross collection, alongside the private VC collection amassed by Michael Ashcroft, 241 medals in total.|$|E
