2500|$|Häkkinen {{remained}} at McLaren for 1999, with Coulthard partnering {{him for the}} upcoming season. The team suffered problems with their car, the McLaren MP4/14, during pre-season testing, resulting in a lack of preparation. Despite these setbacks, Häkkinen was confident going into the season, saying: [...] "I've gained confidence and experience and am more relaxed. With this title I {{no longer have to}} tell myself <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> can win, to put pressure on myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carolyn's second child, Betty Jessop, turned {{eighteen}} in 2007 {{and returned}} to the FLDS. As was acknowledged by both parties, Carolyn had to physically force her to leave the FLDS when she was thirteen. Since returning to the FLDS, Betty has openly disputed the claims in Carolyn's book, particularly those alleging that Merril Jessop was abusive, saying [...] "it just makes me want to laugh." [...] She describes her years outside of the sect as traumatic, explaining that public school was a shock and that the task of caring for her siblings fell to her due to her mother's health problems: [...] "With the responsibility landing on me so hard <b>every</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>I</b> was an emotional wreck, and after a while, I hardened into a frazzled bundle of nerves." [...] She added, [...] "I was such a representation of everything [...] hated so much. I just couldn't deny what was in my heart -- my belief in my religion and my love for my father and my family. I spent four years , and there is nothing there for me." ...|$|E
60|$|Six months passed. <b>Every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> {{went to my}} mass: {{every evening}} I spent in my {{customary}} dissipations.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{start at}} 6 am just about <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> and <b>I</b> work until 3 pm. It's {{amazing how much}} you can achieve." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a halfpenny. She was {{as regular}} {{as a little}} bee and always paid <b>every</b> Monday <b>morning.</b> <b>I</b> am sorry she has left you, neighbour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is a good}} idea," [...] {{declared}} the Grand Gallipoot. [...] "I'd like King Roquat for my own slave. He could black my boots and bring me my porridge <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> while <b>I</b> am in bed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You remember, mother," [...] Gavin said, [...] "how I almost {{prayed for}} the manse {{that was to}} give you an egg <b>every</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>I</b> have been telling Jean never to forget the egg." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, for <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> go {{into the}} city to sell my veils, and with the few shillings I get for them I buy all we want. To-day I did not cross the bridge, so of course I had nothing for food.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It marks, Bob, the {{delimitation}} between London and country, between {{slavery and}} freedom. Here, <b>every</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>I</b> leave myself behind; here, every evening, I recover myself--or, at least, a considerable portion of myself--at a further mark, {{half a mile}} on, I am completely restored.|$|E
500|$|Nash's great {{sporting}} {{success can}} be partly attributed to his self-confidence. Once, when asked who was the greatest footballer he had ever seen, Nash replied [...] "I {{see him in the}} mirror <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> when <b>I</b> shave".|$|R
60|$|I {{never forget}} the days when Mr. Appleby used to light the kitchen fire himself and I used to do the week's washing <b>every</b> Monday <b>morning.</b> <b>I</b> don't think we've changed much since then, either of us.|$|R
60|$|I {{understood}} Mrs. Micawber now, {{and begged}} {{her to make}} use of me to any extent. I began to dispose of the more portable articles of property that very evening; and went out on a similar expedition almost <b>every</b> <b>morning,</b> before <b>I</b> went to Murdstone and Grinby's.|$|R
6000|$|... "Birmingham," [...] {{answered}} the actor, puffing a cigarette. [...] "Didn't I tell you I was a Futurist? I {{really do believe}} in those things if I believe in anything. Change, bustle and new things <b>every</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>I</b> am going to Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Hull, Huddersfield, Glasgow, Chicago--in short, to enlightened, energetic, civilized society!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have got}} the [...] "Copperfield" [...] reading ready for delivery, and am now going to blaze away at [...] "Nickleby," [...] which I don't like half as well. <b>Every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> [...] "go in" [...] at these marks {{for two or three}} hours, and then {{collapse}} and do nothing whatever (counting as nothing much cricket and rounders).|$|E
60|$|I now {{began to}} feel my way in the science, and soon came to {{understand}} that, provided a man had a nose sufficiently conspicuous he might, by merely following it, arrive at a Lionship. But my attention was not confined to theories alone. <b>Every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> gave my proboscis a couple of pulls and swallowed a half dozen of drams.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, my lads," [...] said he, [...] "since {{you have}} agreed that I shall {{continue}} to be your captain on shore {{as well as at}} sea--to be the governor, in short, of this little colony--it is right that we should come to a distinct understanding as to our new position, and be guided by fixed laws. In time I will draw you up a code which I hope will be ratified by yourselves, and will work well. To-day I mean to start by preaching a sermon. I pr'pose to do so every Sunday, and to have family prayers <b>every</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>Is</b> that agreed to?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I go to mamma's room <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> when <b>I</b> wake," [...] {{the child}} began. [...] "I get into her bed, and I {{give her a}} kiss, and I say 'Good-morning'--and sometimes, if she isn't {{in a hurry to}} get up, I stop in her bed, and go to sleep again. Mamma thought I was asleep this <b>morning.</b> <b>I</b> wasn't asleep--I was only quiet. I don't know why I was quiet." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{protest that}} if some great Power {{would agree to}} make me always think what is true and do what is right, on {{condition}} of being turned {{into a sort of}} clock and wound up <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> before <b>I</b> got out of bed, I should instantly close with the offer.|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{think of}} seeing you two again!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You, Mr. Waddington, of all gentlemen in the world! Well, I declare!" [...] she went on, holding {{out her hand}} across the counter, after having given it a {{preliminary}} wipe with a small duster. [...] "Talk about a deserter! Where {{have you been to}} <b>every</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>I</b> should like to know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't quite understand," [...] Mr. Fentolin persisted, {{a little}} irritably. [...] "I sit there <b>every</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>I</b> want, for instance, {{to be there}} to-morrow morning, and the next morning, and the morning afterwards, to finish a little {{seascape}} I have commenced. Nowhere else will do. Call it a whim or what you will I have begun the picture, and I want to finish it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never see}} such a melancholy family as that afore in my life," [...] said Reuben. [...] "There's Leaf's mother, poor woman! <b>Every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> see her eyes mooning out through the panes of glass like a pot-sick winder-flower; and as Leaf sings a very high treble, and we don't know {{what we should do}} without en for upper G, we'll let en come as a trate, poor feller." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Are they early risers?' {{said her}} ladyship; 'I get up <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> at six. <b>I</b> dare {{say they will}} not receive me; but do you show yourself, and then they cannot refuse.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{took him}} upstairs at once. 'Let me {{look a little}} while,' he said, hanging over the child {{with a sort of}} hungry fondness and curiosity. 'My brother! my brother!' he repeated. 'It has rung in my ears <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> that <b>I</b> can say my brother once more, till I have feared it was a dream.' ...|$|R
60|$|To {{return to}} the jay. In spite of the keeper's persecution, I {{knew that he was}} there; <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> when <b>I</b> got up to look out of the window between four and five o'clock, I heard from some quarter of the village that curious subdued, but far-reaching, scolding note he is {{accustomed}} to utter when his suspicions have been aroused.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite beyond belief!" [...] my Lady added--meaning, no doubt, {{to be more}} {{complimentary}} still. The Professor bowed, but he didn't smile this time. [...] "I {{can assure}} you," [...] he said earnestly, [...] "that, provided the bath was made, I used it <b>every</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>I</b> certainly ordered it--that I am clear about--my only doubt is, whether the man ever finished making it. It's difficult to remember, after so many years--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Daniel {{not having}} yet come to judgment, {{there is no}} news stirring. <b>Every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> proclaim: [...] "At home to Mr. Thompson." [...] Every evening I {{ejaculate}} with Monsieur Jacques[23]: [...] "But he weel come. I know he weel." [...] After which I look vacantly at the boxes; put my hands to my gray wig, {{as if to make}} quite sure that it is still on my head, all safe: and go off, first entrance O.P. to soft music.|$|E
6000|$|... "He seems better somehow. He {{seems to}} have almost stopped smoking--and I'm very glad, for those cigars were awfully bad for him. The doctor {{expressly}} told him he must stop them, but he wouldn't {{pay any attention to}} him. And he seems to take so much more exercise. My bedroom is next to his, you know, and <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> can hear things going on through the wall--father dancing about and puffing a good deal. And one morning I met his valet going in with a pair of Indian clubs. I believe father is really taking himself in hand at last." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Every</b> <b>morning</b> {{and night}} <b>I</b> fed that dog, and I spoke as kindly and gently {{to him as}} I knew how. But he seemed to cherish a distaste for me, and always greeted me with a growl. He was an awful dog.|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked for}} the secret to longevity, Michelson said:"Walking. I was a great walker - four or five miles <b>every</b> <b>morning,</b> weather permitting. <b>I</b> never used a car if I could walk. One of the great joys of life was when I sold my car." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's the air does it," [...] {{explained}} Biggs, when Darry {{spoke about}} the speed. [...] "After you've been out here a while you'll eat like a horse and feel like walking ten miles <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> before breakfast. <b>I</b> tell you, the air is wonderful." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> {{walked over}} to Rothland and {{received}} two hours' instruction from the curate, and in the afternoon my mother taught me modern languages. The {{rest of the day}} I spent alone, wandering whithersoever I pleased, staying away as long as I chose, and returning when I felt inclined. The results of such a life at my age soon developed themselves. I became something of a misanthrope, a great reader, and a passionate lover of Nature. At any rate, it was healthy, and my taste for all sorts of outdoor sport prevented my becoming a bookworm.|$|E
60|$|M. Lacaze, {{unlike the}} rest, took a violent fancy for the Wady Sharmá: the water-scenery enchanted him. His {{sketches}} were almost {{confined to the}} palm-growth, and to the greenery so unexpected in arid Midian, where, according to the old and exploded opinion, Moses wrote the Book of Job. The idea of Arabia is certainly not associated with flowing rills, and waving trees, and rustling zephyrs. <b>Every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> used to awake surprised by {{the song of the}} Naiad, the little runnel whimpling down its bed of rushes, stone, and sand; and the response of the palms making music in the land-breeze.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] she replied, as {{she went}} to the oven to turn a pie that was baking. She put her arm to her {{forehead}} and brushed aside her hair, leaving a mark of flour on her nose. For a moment or two she remained kneeling on the fender, looking into the fire and thinking. [...] "He was in a poor way when he came here, could eat nothing, sick <b>every</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>I</b> suppose it's his liver. They all end like that." [...] She continued to wipe the large black plums {{and put them in the}} dish.|$|E
6000|$|... "Such a {{condition}} in a class, I can't believe it! It is simply disgraceful! I can't think how you have been let to get like it! <b>Every</b> Monday <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> shall come down and examine these books. So don't think that because there is nobody paying any attention to you, that you are free to unlearn everything you ever learned, and go back till you are not fit for Standard Three. I shall examine all books every Monday----" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Ah, but I haven’t {{introduced}} myself. Pleased to meet you, my name’s Linda. I’m thirty-one, {{five foot}} eight, 150 pounds and I wear the best clothes that {{money can buy}} (thanks to my husband’s limitless generosity). I arouse desire in men and envy in other women. And yet, <b>every</b> <b>morning,</b> when <b>I</b> open my eyes to this ideal world that everyone dreams of having but few achieve, I know the day will be a disaster." [...] - Excerpt from Adultery ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm so glad {{my window}} looks east into the sunrising," [...] said Anne, {{going over to}} Diana. [...] "It's so splendid to see the morning coming up over those long hills and glowing through those sharp fir tops. It's new <b>every</b> <b>morning,</b> and <b>I</b> feel as if I washed my very soul in that bath of {{earliest}} sunshine. Oh, Diana, I love this little room so dearly. I don't know how I'll get along without it when I go to town next month." ...|$|R
