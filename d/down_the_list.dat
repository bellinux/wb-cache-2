The examination of any fractures on the bones can potentially help determine cause of death as well by determining if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (before death), peri-mortem (at the time of death), or post-mortem (after death). Ante-mortem fractures will show signs of healing while peri- and post-mortem fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle. Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in bone marrow samples and can help narrow <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of possible identifications.|$|E

25|$|Searching through old videos, {{the team}} learned that Ernie {{had a son}} who'd changed his name from Lionel Dell to Mitchell Douglas. The CSIs assumed {{that he could be}} the killer. However, they soon learned that Ernie’s son despised his father, and that Ernie seemed to love his adopted {{children}} more. Upon learning of his fostering of children, the CSIs learned from a video tape that Ernie had at least thirteen foster kids, any one of which could be the Miniature Killer. The CSIs managed to slowly narrow <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> after tracking numerous of the Dell foster children down, some of whom had died over the years. After epithelials were discovered on a fingerprint of one of the miniature dolls made by the Miniature Killer, the CSI team learned that the killer was female, narrowing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of children further.|$|E

25|$|An acrostic {{is a type}} of word puzzle, in eponymous acrostic form, that {{typically}} consists of two parts. The first is a set of lettered clues, each of which has numbered blanks representing the letters of the answer. The second part is a long series of numbered blanks and spaces, representing a quotation or other text, into which the answers for the clues fit. In most forms of the puzzle, the first letters of each correct clue answer, read in order from clue A on <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>list,</b> will spell out the author of the quote and the title of the work it is taken from; this can be used as an additional solving aid.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the current}} rules, {{in the event}} of more than one country scoring the same total number of points, a count is made of the numbers of {{countries}} who awarded points to each of the tied countries, and the one who received points from the most countries is declared the winner. If the numbers are still tied, it is counted how many sets of maximum points (12 points) each country received. If there is still a tie, the numbers of 10-point scores awarded are compared—and then the numbers of 8-point scores, all the way <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>list.</b> In the extremely unlikely event of there then still being a tie for first place, the song performed earliest in the running order is declared the winner, unless the host country performed first in the running order.

25|$|The Nazis {{respected}} Eckenfelder's work, whose motifs {{could easily}} be interpreted {{in terms of their}} blood and soil ideology. On 9 December 1928 Eckenfelder had signed a joint election manifesto issued by the Sparerbund (Association of Savers) and the Nazi Party, although he was not a member of either organization. In Württemberg at that time, the Nazis had a stronger conservative orientation and entered into coalitions on the local level with single-issue middle-class parties. Friedrich Eckenfelder, whose monarchist worldview had been badly shaken by the Munich Soviet Republic and who was affected by the hyperinflation of the period, could certainly identify with the contents of the manifesto. As a figurehead, he headed the joint Nazi-Sparerbund candidate list, but evidently the voters did not take his candidacy seriously: he received markedly fewer votes than candidates further <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>list.</b> In 1933, as Balingen's most prominent contemporary artist, he was commissioned by the town to produce paintings as gifts for the three newest honorary citizens: Hitler, Hindenburg and Murr. The local Nazi Party headquarters commissioned him to paint a portrait of Hitler.|$|E

500|$|In 1979 {{came the}} first extreme attack on Scott, from Roland Huntford's dual {{biography}} Scott and Amundsen in which Scott {{is depicted as}} a [...] "heroic bungler". Huntford's thesis had an immediate impact, becoming the contemporary orthodoxy. After Huntford's book, several other mostly negative books about Captain Scott were published; Francis Spufford, in a 1996 history not wholly antagonistic to Scott, refers to [...] "devastating evidence of bungling", concluding that [...] "Scott doomed his companions, then covered his tracks with rhetoric". Travel writer Paul Theroux summarised Scott as [...] "confused and demoralised... an enigma to his men, unprepared and a bungler". This temporary decline in Scott's reputation {{was accompanied by a}} corresponding rise in that of his erstwhile rival Shackleton, at first in the United States but eventually in Britain as well.

The committee revised the list to recommend Beenamol for the award over Bhagwat but also put a request [...] "to consider everyone". The decision spurred criticism for ignoring the achievements of the shooter and Bhagwat and the National Rifle Association of India expressed their [...] "disappointment" [...] with the decision. Later, the government accepted all the recommendations [...] "as an exception" [...] and jointly awarded Beenamol and Bhagwat for the year 2002.|$|E

Every year, the NHC re-analyzes the systems of the past hurricane season and revises the storm history frequently if there is new data that was operationally unavailable. If the storm had been operationally recognized, {{it would have been}} named Subtropical Storm Tammy, and storms forming after October4 would have been moved one name <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>list.</b> Hurricane Wilma would have been given the name Alpha: a name that, had it been retired like Wilma was, could not be replaced by an [...] "alternate" [...] Greek letter, as is the convention with names on the standard A–W list. When the system strengthened into a subtropical storm on October4, it was the earliest the 19th tropical or subtropical storm of the season formed. The old record was held by an unnamed storm in the 1933 Atlantic hurricane season, which formed on October25, 1933. It was also only the fourth time that 19storms formed in a season.|$|E

Jim Farber of the Daily News criticized Williams, saying [...] "Even aided by studio correction, the guy can't sing", calling it [...] "bad singing at its engaging best". Cohen of Pitchfork Media bashed the lyrics, saying that the writing was [...] "far <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of what N.E.R.D. is actually good at". Hoard of Rolling Stone felt he learned nothing from the lyrics except that Williams was sexually aroused. Henriques of PopMatters noted that Williams is not a [...] "technically gifted rapper", he [...] "does not have a beautiful voice" [...] and his lyrics are [...] "typically inconsequential in a 'saying shit just to sound cool' sort of way", but found strengths in his choruses, which he pointed out [...] "typically use a catchy phrase or recognizable melody as an anchor for his nonsensical verses". Dan Charnas of The Washington Post commended N.E.R.D for their songwriting, writing that Seeing Sounds [...] "combines the adolescent and clever". The Times writer Priya Elan gave the album 4 out of 5 stars and wrote that band is [...] "pushing the boundaries of the popular song". [...] In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau gave the album a three-star honorable mention (...) and stated, [...] "Beats of course, songs usually, singing barely--especially sincere-type singing"; he also picked out two songs from the album: [...] "Anti-Matter" [...] and [...] "Everyone Nose (All the Girls Standing in the Line for the Bathroom)".|$|E
