40|$|European Union (EU) law {{has played}} a key role in {{enforcing}} the EU BEPS agenda, while also introducing limits to the application thereof. The European Commission (EC) sees a clear link between aggressive tax planning and competition law. Against this background, EU State aid law has been employed to challenge the business models of multinational enterprises. At present there are a number of opened cases, where a decision either by the EC or the General Court of the EU is pending. These cases deal with the application of EU State aid law on inter alia tax regimes (e. g. exemption of interest and royalty payments), transfer pricing, and the misapplication of law. The approach the EC is taking in those cases, especially in matters of competence, raises a number of questions, which can only be addressed in a definitive manner by the EU Courts. Similar issues may arise in the field of positive harmonization through the recently adopted Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD). For instance, given that a <b>general</b> <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>rule</b> has been included in Art. 6 ATAD and has therefore become EU law, the EC and the EU Courts are competent to decide whether it should be applied in certain situations, and whether non-application thereof may amount to unlawful State aid. However, EU free movement law should be respected by Member States when implementing anti-BEPs measures. Accordingly, so far, the limitation on benefits clause contained in double tax treaties has been challenged by the EC, while the compatibility of the anti-avoidance rules against hybrid mismatches with EU free movement law is questionable...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} resolving issues {{pertaining}} to tax avoidance, and particularly its aggressive forms, {{has been the}} focal point of discussion among tax scholars which is increasingly gaining attention of politicians alike. As opposed to tax evasion (which is illegal), the phenomenon of tax avoidance calls for careful consideration of state fiscal interests and a highly precise demarcation of the thin line between the acceptable and unacceptable conduct. In many contemporary states, tax avoidance (which implies a formal behaviour of tax payers within the limits of tax legislation but contrary to the tax regulation objectives) is declared to be illegitimate. State authorities do not want to tolerate such activity, which results in tax payers' reduction or avoidance of tax liabilities. We should also bear in mind that all tax payers have the tax planning option at their disposal, by means of which they make sure that they do not pay more tax than they are legally obliged to. However, in case they skilfully use the tax regulation flaws and loopholes {{for the sole purpose of}} tax evasion, and/or resort to misrepresentation and deceptive constructs, they are considered to be exceeding the limits of acceptable tax behaviour. In comparison to the specific anti-abuse measures which have been built into some national tax legislations, there is a growing number of states that introduce the <b>general</b> <b>anti-abuse</b> legislations, which is based on judicial doctrines or statutory legislation. Yet, there is a notable difference among the envisaged anti-abuse measures depending on whether the national legislation is based on the Anglo-American or European-Continental legal system. The efficiency of applying these <b>general</b> <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>rules</b> in taxation largely rests on their interpretation as well as on their relationship with the principle of legality...|$|R

40|$|The EU Directive {{laying down}} rules against tax {{avoidance}} practices that directly affect {{the functioning of}} the Internal Market—the so-called Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) —was adopted on 12 July 2016. It {{has become one of the}} core vehicles for implementing the output of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative, a process led by the G 20 and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), at the EU level. The ATAD has imposed a legally binding obligation upon EU Member States to incorporate the conclusions of Action 2 (hybrid mismatch arrangements), Action 3 (controlled foreign company (CFC) rules) and Action 4 (interest deductions) of the BEPS in their domestic laws and regulations, and it has secured a certain uniformity of national implementing measures across the EU by imposing a common minimum level of protection. In addition, the ATAD has also set out a <b>general</b> <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>rule</b> (GAAR) and exit tax provisions, which further strengthen the EU’s baseline protection of tax revenues. The potential impact of this milestone Directive on the Internal Market and the tax systems of Member States in a short- to long-term period is still to be evaluated. This article offers preliminary thoughts, focusing primarily on the UK’s perspective. The author first briefly addresses possible consequences for the EU as a whole, and then analyses the ATAD from the UK’s point of view, showing how the adoption of this Directive fits into a broader UK tax policy and law both prior to and following the Brexit vote...|$|E
40|$|In {{the realm}} of tax law, as in other areas {{discussed}} in this book, Lord Hoffmann?s strongest theme {{has been one of}} purposive construction. Lord Hoffmann helped to review and revise an approach to tax avoidance {{at a time when it}} had moved away from purposive construction toward a judicial rule of doubtful propriety (the so-called ?Ramsay principle?). At one point, however, Lord Hoffmann?s explanation of his approach to construction threatened to create another type of formula - a distinction between commercial and juristic concepts, which proved to be impractical. What might have worked if always in his expert hands would not necessarily work in the hands of others. An approach that cannot be applied at all levels of the legal system is unlikely to be a sensible way forward. There is a tendency amongst lower courts, and those on the ground who have to implement legislation, to look for concrete rules and formulaic guidance. Purposive construction alone may appear to give rise to uncertainty, especially in an area where the purpose of the legislation can be elusive. In such circumstances, references to ?economic? or ?commercial? concepts do not provide the kind of guidance that is sought. This means that, despite the serious intellectual effort and judicial focus that have been brought to bear on the problem of construing tax legislation to give effect to the intention of Parliament, the case law on tax avoidance remains unsatisfactory and resort is frequently taken to legislative ?solutions?. Very often these legislative solutions take the form of specified tax avoidance provisions, but the apparent inability of the judiciary to solve the tax avoidance problem has led also to the introduction of a statutory <b>general</b> <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>rule</b> (GAAR). Lord Hoffmann participated in a study group advising on the development and adoption of a UK GAAR. This suggests an acceptance that the judiciary cannot tackle the problem of tax avoidance resulting from abuse of tax legislation without assistance. The legislative approach in the GAAR is not, however, one that relieves judges of the need to look at the purpose of the legislation. In fact it requires them to look very carefully at the purpose of the legislation, but provides a framework to guide them in this difficult endeavour and, in certain circumstances, allows them to go beyond the confines of pure purposive construction as it is usually applied in the UK. This solution neatly frames Lord Hoffmann?s views of the role of the judiciary in such cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{past few}} years have seen a surge of new {{political}} initiatives {{with the aim of}} combating tax evasion and tax avoidance. As a part of these initiatives on the level of the European Union, the Council enacted in January 2015 a new general anti-abuse provision to the Parent-Subsidiary Directive. The Parent-Subsidiary Directive regulates tax benefits to cross-border distributions in the EU with the purpose of eliminating obstacles to formation of corporate groups across the Member State borders. The Directive contained previously a provision that authorized the Member States to apply their national anti-abuse provisions within the scope of the Directive although the application of these provisions was voluntary, and the content and scope of the national provisions was not regulated by the Directive. In the words of the Commission, the purpose of the change was to prevent misuse of the Directive and to create consistency, and these aims were to be achieved by introduction of a common anti-abuse rule in all the Member States. The new <b>general</b> <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>rule</b> in the Parent-Subsidiary Directive represents an approach without precedents in the field of European direct tax law since it creates a detailed anti-abuse provision with the objective of harmonizing the national anti-abuse rules applicable to the benefits of the Directive. Most of all, the Member States are, from now on, obliged to combat abuse within the scope of the Directive since the new provision has to be implemented and applied nationally. The provision raises, however, several questions regarding its application and its effects as a part of European tax legislation. The wording of the provision, which contains several conditions with the aim of defining abuse {{in the context of the}} Directive, reflects the varying formulations the ECJ has used in its case law on anti-abuse measures. It may appear prima facie that the provision marks a departure from the consistent case law and creates a new concept of abuse in the field of European tax law. The purpose of the research is to discuss the possible interpretations and the impact of the new provision. The different conditions of the provision are evaluated in the light of the ECJ case law in order to clarify their scope and meaning. The effects of the provision are discussed with respect to the immediate effects of its application, the effects on the Member States and their national anti-abuse rules, and the possible conflicts with the primary law of the EU. The ECJ direct tax case law contains a line of case law where the Court has examined abuse of tax law and the possibility to enact measures in order to combat abusive transactions. The concept of abuse within the field of European direct tax law has been developed especially in relation to such Member State anti-abuse measures which have had restrictive effects on the fundamental freedoms. In this case law, the ECJ has required that these anti-abuse provisions must combat only "wholly artificial arrangements", and the Court has developed specific tests which the national rules must respect when establishing the abusive nature of a transaction. This case law is discussed extensively in order to establish the possible interpretations for the new provision. Regarding the interpretation of the new anti-abuse provision, most questions arise in relation to the relevance of tax purposes and the genuine-nature of the arrangement. Given the variance in the ECJ case law, several ways to interpret the provision are compared in order to establish the most reasonable interpretation. In addition, the discussion reveals different points of uncertainty with regard to the way how the benefits of the Directive are meant to be denied and how the implementation of the provision affects national anti-abuse clauses and the freedom of movement. The research establishes that the new anti-abuse provision can be interpreted in accordance with the established ECJ case law although the wide latitudes of the provision mean that it can be subjected to various interpretations. The most important effects of the provision reside in its compulsory application and the impact on national legislation. The provision can, effectively, prevent the national legislators from adopting different solutions in its scope of application. The actual consequences for the companies that fall within the ambit of the provision contain several questions that cannot be given an unequivocal answer based on the wording of the provision alone. Most of all, the provision is set to cause uncertainty before its scope has been definitely scrutinized by the ECJ...|$|E
40|$|Globalization and {{integration}} of markets gradually weaken not only the actual boundaries between states, but also tax limits. The growing interconnect-edness of national economies and markets causes tax competition, which may be advantageous for some states, but for others {{it may be a}} threat to undermine public budgets. While tax competition generally increases efficiency, it may also have undesirable consequences that may lead to a race to the bottom. Also, differences in the taxation of capital in different countries mean that there are capital shifts to the tax-favourable jurisdictions for the purpose of tax avoidance in the home country. The question therefore arises as to whether tax competition is not an obstacle to effective taxation of corporations, and whether and how governments should counter threats to undermine public finances. While some require mutual cooperation in the coordination and harmonization of direct taxation in the European Union, others argue that the most effective solution is market allocation and acceptance of tax competition. Opinion is divided over whether to maintain or remove tax competition and this leads to a discussion of whether it is really beneficial or harmful. The aim of the dissertation is to answer this question. The dissertation empirically evaluates the level of tax competition in the European Union and using panel analysis it verifies on a sample of 27 Member States over the period 1998 to 2010 that tax competition is not harmful, it does not lead to impoverished public budgets and to a race to the bottom in the EU- 15. It also comes {{to the conclusion that the}} new EU- 12 states do not cause harmful tax competition with the original EU- 15 states. In connection with this the dissertation also focuses on the need to protect the tax bases of individual states. It deals with economic aspects of <b>general</b> and specific <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>rules</b> in national tax systems of the Member States and verifies why, in addition to general rules, states should implement specific measures in the form of CFC rules to defend themselves against tax evasion and tax avoidance...|$|R

40|$|A {{substantial}} {{debate about}} the approaches employed by courts to interpret statutes and regulations has developed during the last decade. Some {{have argued that the}} search for a statute 2 ̆ 7 s meaning and purpose should focus on the text, itself, and should not include consulting legislative history. In contrast, others have argued {{that it is difficult to}} determine the meaning of a statute without consulting legislative history to determine the legislature 2 ̆ 7 s purpose for the statute. The {{debate about the}} appropriate method for interpreting statutes underlies a crisis in the administration of tax law. The recent proliferation of tax shelters has at least in part been facilitated by the ascendancy of textualism. Our conversations with practitioners indicate that tax advisors have become more aggressive in structuring transactions that comply with the form of the tax statutes even though the transactions may be highly questionable in light of the legislation 2 ̆ 7 s history or underlying purpose. The result has been a cottage industry where investment banks and accounting firms market tax shelters that triumph in form, but not substance, at the expense of the fisc. Because most tax shelter activity is hidden, it is difficult to ascertain its revenue impact. It is estimated that tax shelters reduced tax revenues by approximately 10 to 24 billion in 1999. In addition, practitioners and government officials worry that the use of shelters is eroding confidence in the tax system. Although the majority of courts have not adopted textualism, the legal community 2 ̆ 7 s acceptance of textualism as a plausible method of interpretation has dramatically affected the practice of tax law. Taxpayers often invest in tax shelters based upon the opinion of counsel assessing the probability that the desired tax results from the transaction, if challenged, will be sustained. These opinion letters are essential to attract investors because they protect taxpayers from various penalties that otherwise might be imposed if the Service successfully challenges the transaction. Under the textualist approach, it is much easier for an attorney to write a favorable opinion for transactions that are designed to comply with the letter of the law, but not its spirit, for at least two reasons. First, the attorney is permitted to ignore, or at least downplay, any legislative history that would argue against, or undercut, the desired tax results. Second, under a textualist approach, it is arguable that various well-accepted judicial doctrines, such as the business purpose doctrine, are suspect. At the extreme, a textualist might argue that these doctrines are the product of judicial activism and either should no longer be followed, or at a minimum should not be extended into new areas of the law. Tax shelter promoters have exploited the move towards textualism by designing transactions that comply with the letter of the law, but that generate results clearly never contemplated by Congress or the Treasury. Some promoters believe that the more detailed and complex the underlying law is, the more likely it is that a transaction complying with the letter of the law will be respected. One area in tax law that is particularly detailed and complex is Subchapter K, the partnership tax provisions. Subchapter K also has several special rules not otherwise available in the Internal Revenue Code. It is, therefore, not surprising that Subchapter K has become the vehicle of choice for a wide variety of abusive transactions. Transactions are designed so that a partnership is created or joined just to take advantage of these special rules (reverse engineered transactions). In an attempt to stem the tide, the IRS adopted a <b>general</b> <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>rule</b> for Subchapter K. This rule requires that the provisions of Subchapter K be interpreted consistent with the intent of subchapter K. Oversimplified, the regulations assert that there is an overall legislative intent underlying Subchapter K, and if a partnership is formed or availed of in connection with a transaction to substantially reduce federal taxes in a manner inconsistent with this intent, the transaction may be recast. The regulations make clear that for a transaction to pass muster, doctrines that originated with the judiciary, i. e., the requirements of a business purpose, economic substance, and substance over form, must be taken into account. In addition, the regulations require that the purposivist method of statutory interpretation be used to interpret Subchapter K. The anti-abuse regulations caused an unprecedented furor within the tax bar. They have been severely criticized by academics and practitioners alike on a variety of bases, the most damning of which is that Treasury lacked the authority to promulgate the rules and that therefore they are not valid. Indeed, it is fair to say that there is a general consensus that the partnership anti-abuse regulations are an extreme example of administrative overreaching. We disagree. Although we do not endorse all the policy choices in the anti-abuse regulations, we believe that they are not only valid, but suggest a way in which transactions that are the product of reverse engineering can and should be attacked, both within and without Subchapter K. Initially, it may seem inappropriate for Treasury to instruct the judiciary on how and when the courts should apply judicial doctrines and what tools they should use in interpreting statutes. After all, as every law student knows, [i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U. S. 137, 177 (1803). Where does Treasury get the authority to instruct a court as to which method of interpretation it should use to interpret a tax statute? On reflection, however, we believe that Treasury acted well within its authority under Chevron, U. S. A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984) and was simply filling a gap in the statute left by Congress. The judicial doctrines that are implicit in the intent of subchapter K were well-developed when Subchapter K was first enacted in 1954 and continue to be applied in a variety of contexts by the courts. At that time, however, it was not clear exactly how and when these doctrines should be applied in the context of Subchapter K. There is little doubt Congress could have clarified this issue by statute. It could have insisted that these doctrines (or variations thereof) be applied with full force, or it could have forbidden their application altogether. Congress, however, chose not to address this issue, leaving a gap in the statute. Under current administrative law principles, this silence constitutes an implied delegation of authority by Congress to Treasury to fill that gap. In addition to being valid, we also believe that, as a general proposition, it is sound tax policy to use broad standards to administer the tax law. Historically this had been accomplished by the courts through the use of these judicial doctrines. Although the ascendancy of textualism cast doubt on the continuing viability of the doctrines, Treasury eliminated that doubt by promulgating these regulations (if valid), and requiring lawyers and courts to consider the intent of subchapter K. This approach allows the IRS to use broad standards to administer the tax law in place of a collection of narrow rules that must be constantly changed in a hopeless attempt to keep pace with the latest tax gimmick. To assure proper consideration of these doctrines by tax advisors, we recommend that the IRS amend its standards for practice to require advisors opining on the validity of tax shelters to apply the doctrines to the specific facts of the tax shelter in their opinion letter...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the taxation of hybrid instruments {{and the impact}} of the new amendments adopted to the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive in Finland. A Government Bill 59 / 2015 proposed the Directive amendments to be implemented to 6 a§ of the Business Income Tax Act (EVL) to tackle hybrid mismatch arrangements and to prevent any misuse of the Directive. Hybrid instruments are financial instruments that have both equity and debt characteristics, which makes the classification to either equity or debt difficult. Finnish legislation does not recognize hybrid instruments but the classification in practice follows the legal form of the instrument. Classification problems typically arise when a hybrid loan has equity characteristics but there has been no case law so far where a hybrid loan has been reclassified as equity for tax purposes. Hybrid mismatches are born in cross-border transactions e. g. when hybrid instrument is classified differently in different tax jurisdictions. These arrangements can lead to double non-taxation, i. e. to an outcome where the income generated by the instrument is not taxed anywhere. Lately, EU and OECD have aimed to prevent aggressive tax planning and the amendments to the Parent-Subsidiary Directive are part of EU's larger plan to strengthen the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion. Amendments aim to refrain from granting the Directive benefits, i. e. tax exemption on direct investment dividends in the parent company's Member State, in situations where the same distribution is considered tax deductible in the Member State of the subsidiary. Furthermore, a <b>general</b> <b>anti-abuse</b> clause was adopted to prevent any misuse of the Directive and to ensure a greater consistency in its application in different Member States. It is applicable in situations where the arrangement is not seen "genuine" or if one of its main purposes is tax avoidance. Amendments to the Directive were implemented to Finnish Business Income Tax Act 6 a§ by adding paragraphs 8 and 9, which are applied from tax year 2016 onwards. Impacts to Finnish entities remain somewhat unclear regarding the new <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>rule.</b> Since hybrid instruments are in principle considered as debt, situations where a Finnish entity is a debtor in a hybrid arrangement seem more common than vice versa. Thus, the impact of the new legislation regarding new paragraph 8 is not likely very significant. However, companies' administrative burden will grow, as tax treatment of the dividend distribution in the source state needs to be figured out. The new regulation will also overrule any dividend exemptions in tax treaties, since it is argued {{that the purpose of the}} new regulation is to prevent double non-taxation whereas double tax treaties' purpose is to eliminate double taxation, not to enable it...|$|R

40|$|To combat abusive tax shelters, the Department of the Treasury promulgated a <b>general</b> <b>anti-abuse</b> {{regulation}} {{applicable to}} all of subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Treasury targeted subchapter K because unique aspects of the partnership tax laws—including its aggregate-entity dichotomy—foster creative tax manipulation. In the anti-abuse regulation, the Treasury attempted to “codify” existing judicially-created anti-abuse doctrines, such as the business-purpose and economic-substance doctrines. Also, and more surprisingly, the Treasury directed those applying subchapter K to use a purposivist approach to interpretation and to reject textualism. In this article, I demonstrate that the Treasury exceeded both its constitutional and statutory authority. Congress neither expressly nor implicitly delegated to the Treasury the power either to direct a method of statutory interpretation or to codify the judicially developed anti-abuse doctrines. Hence, the regulation is unconstitutional. Alternatively, even if Congress validly delegated either power to the Treasury, the anti-abuse regulation exceeded the scope of any delegated power and is, thus, ultra vires...|$|R

50|$|All {{proposals}} eliminate {{profit shifting}} {{by means of}} transfer pricing or financing. Basically, formula apportionment works like a tax on each factor included in the formula. Since the Commission {{does not want to}} question the Member States' right to set the tax rate, there is still room for tax competition via the tax rates. Due to the common tax base across the EU, it is no longer possible for Member States to compensate high-tax rates with a narrow tax base or vice versa. The Member States compete rather for real investments than for tax bases. The Commission's proposal of a CCCTB could be {{a solution to the problem}} of international corporate tax planning within the EU. In particular, the CCCTB eliminates the incentive to shift profits to low-tax countries via transfer pricing or financing. However, there is still room for tax competition between Member States as long as the tax rates are not harmonised within the EU. Moreover, the existing problems of the arm's length principle continue to exist with respect to third countries. Effectively, the CCCTB introduces a new system of formula apportionment in addition to the system of arm's length. Thus, at present, the introduction of the CCCTB does not seem realistic on a political level, because the harmonisation requirements are high: a common tax base, a European profit allocation formula and common consolidation and <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>rules</b> would have to be introduced.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the concept of}} corporate residence" with particular reference to {{the law in the}} UK and Canada. It explores why corporate residence is relevant in tax policy, how corporate residence is understood in law, and how revenue authorities respond to the use and alleged 'abuse' of residence rules. Part I argues that the residence of taxpayers generally (individual or corporate) remains a relevant factor in international tax design, that taxation of corporations on the basis of residence has some justification, but that there is a disjunction between meaningful residence-based taxation and current definitions of corporate residence in domestic law and tax treaties. The formulations of residence based on incorporation, central management and control, and place of effective management, particularly as applied to multinational enterprises, are considered and are found to be deficient. Part II critically {{analyzes the}} major policy responses of the UK and Canadian governments to the exploitation of corporate residence. It argues that key legislative and administrative responses to international tax avoidance activities, for both outbound and inbound investment, are purportedly based on the acceptance of formal corporate residence yet undermine that concept in an effort to impose tax or refuse treaty relief based on where economic interests actually exist. The responses considered are the application of controlled foreign companies legislation to offshore subsidiaries, the invocation of treaty <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>rules</b> with respect to offshore intermediaries, and the use of overarching general anti-avoidance measures to challenge varied structures that rely on offshore entities. These haphazard anti-avoidance rules are overlaid with revenue authorities' indignation at the motivations that underlie many corporate relocations. It is argued that a more coherent approach would be to focus on the objective reality or unreality of corporate establishment, by reformulating corporate residence in domestic law and tax treaties.

40|$|The {{rule that}} {{charities}} {{are not allowed}} to intervene in political campaigns has now been in place for over fifty years. Despite uncertainty about the exact reasons for Congress 2 ̆ 7 enactment of it, skepticism by some about its validity for both constitutional and public policy reasons, and continued confusion about its exact parameters, this rule has survived virtually unchanged for all of those years. Yet while overall noncompliance with the income tax laws has drawn significant scholarly attention, few scholars have focused on violations of this prohibition and the IRS 2 ̆ 7 attempts to enforce it. This Article focuses on the elusive issue of how extensive is noncompliance with this prohibition and how could the IRS improve its enforcement in this area. The limited data available about the extent of noncompliance indicates that while violations involving extensive expenditures or high profile activities are relatively rare, minor and probably mostly inadvertent violations may be much more widespread than current IRS enforcement figures would indicate. Such violations should be of concern because they risk creating a culture of noncompliance, they may harm the public 2 ̆ 7 s trust in both the violating charities and the charitable sector as a whole, and they may have significant effects on the outcome of political campaigns because of the public 2 ̆ 7 s generally high regard for charities. To address these violations, the Treasury Department and the IRS should adopt three strategies. First, the IRS should reduce its reliance on third-party complaints by pro-actively looking in publicly available information for possible violations, including by reviewing websites, media reports, and state campaign finance filings. Second, the Treasury Department should adopt an approach that has generally worked in other tax contexts by clarifying the vague boundaries of the prohibition through creating safe harbors for the most common election-related activities, while retaining the current facts and circumstances approach as an <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>rule.</b> Third and finally, the IRS should continue to fully utilize the flexibility of the existing penalty regime to tailor penalties to match violations, issuing only warning tickets for first time, apparently unintentional violators while reserving financial penalties and revocation of tax-exempt status for repeat and intentional violators...|$|R
40|$|When {{professionals}} and other persons who offer their goods and/or {{services to the}} public conduct their businesses through corporations, the Treasury has acknowledged that for federal income tax purposes it must treat those corporations as separate and distinct from their controlling shareholder-employees, even where {{there is only a}} single shareholder-employee, provided that the corporation has a business purpose and the taxpayer consistently respects the corporate form. However, the Treasury has refused to accord equal dignity to incorporated workers who offer their services not to the public at large but to a single recipient or a small number of recipients. The rationale for denying the separate taxpayer status of these 2 ̆ 2 loan-out 2 ̆ 2 corporations is that the party 2 ̆ 2 borrowing 2 ̆ 2 the services of the corporation 2 ̆ 7 s employee is the true employer under common law rules designed to distinguish between independent contractors and employees. This Article examines the tax benefits of incorporating a service business and the principles which have evolved to prevent taxpayer abuse of those benefits, and evaluates the Treasury 2 ̆ 7 s rationale for using worker reclassification to deny loan-outs the tax benefits available to other closely-held corporations. The examination reveals that the common law worker classification standards are not an appropriate test of whether a corporation or its employee is the principal in a transaction. Although paternalism and administrative convenience arguments may favor classifying workers as employees under some circumstances, these arguments deserve little weight where the worker makes the affirmative decision to form a loan-out, thus acknowledging employee status and disputing only the identity of the employer. In effect, the government 2 ̆ 7 s position in the loan-out cases denies the taxpayer the opportunity to select the employment contract that will provide the greatest after-tax returns. Taken to its logical consequence, the government 2 ̆ 7 s worker reclassification approach to disregarding loan-outs would treat any controlled corporation as the agent of its controlling shareholder, a position inconsistent with settled principles of tax law. It is also unnecessary, in light of the <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>rules</b> which are already available to distinguish fraudulent transactions. The Article concludes that the Treasury 2 ̆ 7 s effort to disregard properly formed loan-outs through worker reclassification lacks a sound basis in policy and that it increases, rather than decreases, the inequities of the tax system...|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} {{statutory}} <b>general</b> anti-avoidance or <b>anti-abuse</b> provisions (GAARs) are {{an essential part}} of a modern tax system, since specific legislation will not catch every abuse. Properly drafted GAARs with appropriate protections can give administrators and courts an important tool to use in cases of egregious abuse, but the use must be within a legitimate framework suitable for the jurisdiction in question. GAARs are not the appropriate mechanism for a fundamental rewriting of domestic or international tax law, but they are a valuable element of the statute book in the fight to combat artificial tax arrangements...|$|R
40|$|In the {{proposal}} for a Council Directive on a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) there have been introduced a specific <b>anti-abuse</b> provisions, CFC <b>rules.</b> These rules are aimed at tax evasions and tax avoidance. The basic principle is {{the protection of the}} tax base against erosion through practices of artificial income shifting. Generally, CFC rules prevent tax avoidance in a state of a shareholder by denying the deferred taxation of profits generated by its controlled company, which is a resident in a tax preference jurisdiction. Even thought the CCCTB directive would be aided easier and low-costs cross-border business as well as it would be restricted the harmful tax competition there are questions whether it is advisable to introduce these rules into such system of the CCCTB, whether these rules are compatible with the CCCTB and whether it is regulated properly. So, the focus of this paper rests on the interaction of the proposed CCCTB directive with existing CFC rules in the European Union.
