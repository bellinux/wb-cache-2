5|$|A {{study on}} the {{carpenter}} ant Camponotus floridanus found a special surface <b>hydrocarbon</b> on queen-laid eggs. Workers in the colony with the queen's eggs refrained from egg-laying, whereas other groups {{that did not have}} queen-laid eggs showed worker reproduction. Thus, the <b>hydrocarbon</b> could act as a signal to alert workers to halt reproduction. More generally, however, the authors concluded that the hydrocarbons were a fertility signal. It is still unknown as to how the decision to restrain reproduction occurs or what minimum threshold of fertility in the queen is needed to reduce worker reproduction.|$|E
5|$|All {{living things}} on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid {{water as a}} solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid <b>hydrocarbon,</b> such as methane or ethane. Water is a {{stronger}} solvent than methane. Water is also more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a <b>hydrocarbon</b> would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.|$|E

They have revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring, outside the brighter main rings of Saturn and inside the G and Erings. The source of this ring is hypothesized to be the crashing of a meteoroid off Janus and Epimetheus. In July 2006, Cassini images provided evidence of <b>hydrocarbon</b> lakes near Titan's north pole, the presence of which were confirmed in January 2007. In March 2007, additional images near Titan's north pole revealed <b>hydrocarbon</b> seas, the largest of which is almost {{the size of the}} Caspian Sea.

40|$|Vibronic {{interaction}} {{and its role}} in the occurrence of possible superconductivity in the monoanions of phenanthrene-edge-type aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> are studied. The vibrational frequencies and the vibronic coupling constants are computed and analyzed and the electron-phonon coupling constants are estimated. The results for phenanthrene-edge-type <b>hydrocarbons</b> are compared with those for acene-edge-type <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The lowest frequency mode and the C-C stretching modes of 1400 - 1600 cm(- 1) afford large electron-phonon coupling constants in the monoanions of acene- and phenanthrene-edge-type <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The total electron-phonon coupling constants decrease with {{an increase in the number}} of carbon atoms in both acene- and phenanthrene-edge-type <b>hydrocarbons,</b> but those for the monoanions of phenanthrene-edge-type <b>hydrocarbons</b> are larger than those for the monoanions of acene-edge-type <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Possible superconducting transition temperatures T(c) s for the monoanions are estimated. The monoanions of phenanthrene-edge- type <b>hydrocarbons</b> would have higher T(c) s than the monoanions of acene-edge- type <b>hydrocarbons</b> if phenanthrene-edge-type <b>hydrocarbons</b> exhibit superconductivity. These results suggest that molecular edge structures as well as molecular sizes have relevance to the strength of electron-phonon coupling and T(c) s. The fragment molecular-orbital method (FMO) method successfully characterizes the distinct electronic structures of the two small polynuclear aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PAHs) with different type of edges such as anthracene and phenanthrene.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The binding {{of eleven}} polycyclic, {{aromatic}} <b>hydrocarbons</b> to the acid form of poly A has been investigated. The <b>hydrocarbons</b> {{were chosen to}} test a size criterion. Model building showed that some <b>hydrocarbons</b> could intercalate in the helix and be well protected from contact with the aqueous solvent. Experimentally {{it was found that}} those <b>hydrocarbons</b> which were small enough to be protected were bound to poly A. <b>Hydrocarbons</b> which were too large to be so protected did not bind. A size criterion for the binding of <b>hydrocarbons</b> to poly A therefore exists. The flow dichroism of four poly A-hydrocarbon complexes was measured. The flow dichroism measurements were consistent with the intercalation model. The dissociation energy of several <b>hydrocarbons</b> is found to occur in an order that is different from that given by the size criterion. There was no correlation between the binding of individual <b>hydrocarbons</b> to poly A and the energy of dissocation of individual <b>hydrocarbons</b> from the crystalline state. The size criterion for poly A, together with a previously examined size criterion for DNA, and the flow dichroism data serve as unequivocal evidence that <b>hydrocarbons</b> intercalate in polynucleotides...|$|R

Apart from aluminium hydroxide, use of phosphorus based flame-retardants—in the form of, for example, organophosphates—now exceeds that of any of the other main retardant types.

40|$|Gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} with {{electron ionization}} and positive-ion chemical ionization and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOF-MS) were {{applied for the}} characterization of the chemical composition of complex <b>hydrocarbons</b> in the non-polar neutral fraction of cigarette smoke condensates. Automated data processing by TOF-MS software combined with structured chromatograms and manual review of library hits were used to assign the components from GC x GC-TOF-MS analysis. The distributions of aliphatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> and aromatics were also investigated. Over 100 isoprenoid <b>hydrocarbons</b> were detected, including carotene degradation products, phytadiene isomers and carbocyclic diterpenoids. A total of 1800 <b>hydrocarbons</b> were tentatively identified, including aliphatic <b>hydrocarbons,</b> aromatics, and isoprenoid <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The identified <b>hydrocarbons</b> by GC x GC-TOF-MS were far more than those by GC-MS.

5000|$|Migration - The <b>hydrocarbons</b> are {{expelled}} from source rock by three density-related mechanisms: the newly matured <b>hydrocarbons</b> are less dense than their precursors, which causes over-pressure; the <b>hydrocarbons</b> are lighter, and so migrate upwards due to buoyancy, and the fluids expand as further burial causes increased heating.
