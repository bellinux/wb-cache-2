In this work, we study spectra and eigenfunctions of discrete differential operators that can serve {{as an alternative to}} the discrete Laplacians for applications in shape analysis. We construct such operators as the Hessians of surface energies, which operate on a function space on the surface, or of <b>deformation</b> <b>energies,</b> which operate on a shape space. In particular, we design a quadratic energy such that, on the one hand, its Hessian equals the Laplace operator if the surface is a part of the Euclidean plane, and, on the other hand, the Hessian eigenfunctions are sensitive to the extrinsic curvature (e. g. sharp bends) on curved surfaces. Furthermore, we consider eigenvibrations induced by <b>deformation</b> <b>energies,</b> and we derive a closed form representation for the Hessian (at the rest state of the energy) for a general class of <b>deformation</b> <b>energies.</b> Based on these spectra and eigenmodes, we derive two shape signatures.

40|$|In {{the frame}} of refined prompt-neutron {{emission}} models used for evaluation purposes the partition of the total excitation energy (TXE) between fully accelerated fission-fragments plays an important role. In this work the TXE partition between complementary fission fragments is obtained by {{taking into account the}} energy components at scission. The method consists of two steps: the calculation of additional <b>deformation</b> <b>energies</b> of nascent fragments (which are relaxed into excitation energy at full acceleration) and the partition of the available excitation energy at scission (obtained by subtracting the calculated <b>deformation</b> <b>energies</b> from TXE) assuming statistical equilibrium. The obtained fragment excitation energies, as the sum of <b>deformation</b> and excitation <b>energy</b> components at scission, are then used in {{the frame of}} the Point-by-Point model to describe experimental data of prompt fission quantities. The presented procedure of TXE partition is based exclusively on models and straightforward assumptions without the need of adjustable parameters.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The ring-collapse {{mechanism}} of C 24 (D 6 d) has been analyzed using semiempirical AM 1 and B 3 LYP/cc-pVDZ methods. Based on the ring-stacking/circumscribing model, two precursors are selected. Transition states and intermediates are located and energetics are computed. Before the stacking begins, the precursor and belt reach a suitable relative orientation {{accompanied by the}} release of a large amount of energy. It is observed that the reactions between the precursors and the belts are essentially endoergic in nature, whereas the reactions between the stable intermediates and the final belts are exoergic. The <b>deformation</b> <b>energies</b> (DE) and the bond lengths R of the precursors have been computed. The DE values suggest that there is a chance of the cleavage of the bicyclic precursors as the growth process proceeds toward the cage formation. In contrast, the monocyclic precursor is found to have lower <b>deformation</b> <b>energies</b> than the bicyclic precursor. Analysis of average bond length at different cages shows that a large window is formed and the system appears to follow a cascade-type bond formation. Comparisons are made to our previous result...|$|R

The <b>deformation</b> <b>energies</b> (DE) and the average bond lengths 〈R 〉 of the precursors have been computed.

A ground state stabilizing effect assumes that the alpha lone-pair and nucleophilic electron pair destabilize each other by electronic repulsion thereby increasing the ground state and making it more reactive. Stabilization of the transition state is possible by assuming some TS free radical character or assuming that the TS has more advanced nucleophile-substrate bond formation. The polarizability of the nucleophile or involvement of intramolecular catalysis also plays a role.
