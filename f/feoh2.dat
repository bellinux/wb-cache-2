5000|$|Iron(II) {{hydroxide}} or {{ferrous hydroxide}} is an inorganic compound with the formula <b>Fe(OH)2.</b> It is produced when iron(II) salts, from a compound such as iron(II) sulfate, {{are treated with}} hydroxide ions.

50|$|Rapid nitrate {{reduction}} by {{iron powder}} is observed only at pH≤4. pH control with sulfuric acid prolongs nitrate reduction {{and increases the}} amount removed. Ammonia is the end product of nitrate reduction and accounts for all nitrate transformed under certain experimental conditions. However, by using nanoscale iron N2 gas is the product instead. Ferrous species, Fe2+ and <b>Fe(OH)2</b> are probably {{not involved in the}} reaction.|$|E

5000|$|Hydrobromic acid {{used as an}} {{electrolyte}} {{has been}} replaced with a far less toxic alkaline solution (1M KOH) and ferrocyanide. The higher pH is less corrosive, allowing the use of inexpensive polymer tanks. The increased electrical resistance in the membrane was compensated by increasing the voltage. The cell voltage was 1.2 V. The cell's efficiency exceeded 99%, while round-trip efficiency measured 84%. The battery has an expected lifetime of at least 1,000 cycles. Its theoretic energy density was 19 Wh per liter. [...] Ferrocyanide's chemically stability in high pH KOH solution without forming <b>Fe(OH)2</b> or Fe(OH)3 needs to be verified before scale-up.|$|E
40|$|The equilibria and the {{kinetics}} of {{the binding}} of Iron(III) to salicylhydroxamic (SHA) and benzohydroxamic (BHA) acids {{have been investigated}} in aqueous solution (I = 1 M (HClO(4) /NaClO(4)), T = 298 K) using spectrophotometric and stopped-flow methods. Whereas Iron (III) forms a 1 : 1 complex (ML) with BHA, it forms both ML and M(2) L complexes with SHA. The presence of M 2 L in aqueous medium is corroborated by FTIR measurements. The reactive form of Iron(III) is the hydrolyzed species <b>FeOH(2</b> +), which binds to the 0, 0 site in ML and to the O,O and O(P),N (P = phenolate) sites in M(2) L, inducing full deprotonation of the latter. The reaction pathway is {{discussed in terms of}} a multistep mechanistic scheme in which the metal ligand interaction is coupled to hydrolysis and self-aggregation steps of Iron(III). The observation and characterization of M(2) L as a stable species is important because it contains the -Fe-O-N-Fe- sequence, which constitutes the repetitive motif of the SHA-based metallacrown ring and provides the rationale for 12 -MC- 4 metallacrowns. In the framework of this study, the kinetics of the Iron(III) dimerization and trimerization have also been investigated using the stopped-flow method to perform dilution jumps. The reaction scheme put forward involves two parallel steps (<b>FeOH(2</b> +) + <b>FeOH(2</b> +) and Fe(3 +) + <b>FeOH(2</b> +)) that lead to formation of the Fe(2) (OH) (2) (4 +) dimer and a slower step (<b>FeOH(2</b> +) + Fe(2) (OH) (2) (4 +)) to form the trimer species. The kinetics of the last step have been investigated here for the first time, and the results deduced indicate that, of the two possible trimer structures reported in the literature, Fe(3) (OH) (3) (6 +) and Fe(3) (OH) (4) (54 +), the latter prevails by far...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of photo-catalytic reduction of Cr(VI) were investigated in acidic solutions {{with and without}} Fe(III). In a system without Fe(III), no Cr(VI) reduction was observed in dark conditions; conversely, under light conditions, the reduction reaction rate increased to 0. 011 and 0. 020 mu M min(- 1) at pH 2 and pH 1, respectively, indicating the occurrence of Cr(VI) photo-reduction. The Cr(VI) photo-reduction reaction was induced by the photolysis of water molecules, leading to O(2) production. Upon the addition of Fe(III), the photo-reduction rate of Cr(VI) was significantly enhanced due {{to the formation of}} Fe(II), which is the photolytic product of FeCl(2) (+) and the electron donor for Cr(VI) reduction. However, with the same concentration of FeCl complexes, a strong inhibition of Cr(VI) reduction at pH 2 was observed, compared with pH 1. A possible explanation is that <b>FeOH(2</b> +) becomes predominant with increasing pH and that its photolytic product, the OH free radical, is an oxidant for Fe(II) and Cr(III) and can compromise Cr(VI) reduction. The kinetic result of each photo-reduction reaction pathway shows zero-order kinetics, suggesting that the photolysis reaction of H(2) O or FeCl(2 +) is the rate-determining step in each pathway. The results also show the potential of developing a homogeneous photo-catalytic method to treat Cr(Vi) -containing water. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
