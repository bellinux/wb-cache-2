60|$|But {{the road}}, the road down which the marble comes, however immense the blocks! The {{genius of the}} country, {{and the spirit of}} its institutions, pave that road: repair it, watch it, keep it going! Conceive a channel of water running over a rocky bed, beset with great heaps of stone of all shapes and sizes, winding down the middle of this valley; and THAT being the road--because it was the road <b>five</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago!</b> Imagine the clumsy carts of <b>five</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> being used to this hour, and drawn, as they used to be, <b>five</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> by oxen, whose {{ancestors}} were worn to death <b>five</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> as their unhappy descendants are now, in twelve months, by the suffering and agony of this cruel work! Two pair, four pair, ten pair, twenty pair, to one block, according to its size; down it must come, this way. In their struggling from stone to stone, with their enormous loads behind them, they die frequently upon the spot; and not they alone; for their passionate drivers, sometimes tumbling down in their energy, are crushed to death beneath the wheels. But it was good <b>five</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and it must be good now: and a railroad down one of these steeps (the easiest thing in the world) would be flat blasphemy.|$|R

25|$|Despite {{the success}} of {{chemotherapy}} for osteosarcoma, it {{has one of the}} lowest survival rates for pediatric cancer.

Three-year event-free survival ranges from 50% to 75%, and five-year survival ranges from 60% to 85+% in some studies. Overall, 65–70% patients treated <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> will be alive today. These survival rates are overall averages and vary greatly depending on the individual necrosis rate.|$|E

25|$|The {{first round}} of the {{election}} saw the lowest turnout for any Croatian presidential election ever, so many political pundits {{at the beginning of the}} runoff campaign predicted an even lower turnout for the second round. However, as the campaign started to become more heated and the electoral body more divided, it was evident the runoff election would have a greater turnout than the first round. The increase in turnout was 277,661 people, of which 268,166 cast valid votes. Overall, 50.13% of citizens who are eligible to vote fulfilled their public right. That's a little more than 6 percentage points higher turnout than the first round and on pair with <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> but 10 percentage points less than 10 years ago and the lowest turnout for a runoff presidential election ever.|$|E
25|$|The third Grand Slam of {{the year}} at Wimbledon brought with it some surprises: {{for the first time in}} the Open Era none of the top four seeds managed to reach the semifinals. World No. 1 Ivanovic {{surrendered}} to Zheng Jie in the third round, who went on to become the first Chinese women to reach the semifinals of a Grand Slam in singles. Tamarine Tanasugarn knocked out Janković en route to her only major quarterfinal. Sharapova was upset by Alla Kudryavtseva, and Kuznetsova lost to Agnieszka Radwańska, who had shown prior form winning the warm-up tournament in Eastbourne. Serena Williams and her sister Venus Williams reached the final, the first Grand Slam final between the two since Wimbledon <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Venus would defeat her sister for her fifth Wimbledon title. They also teamed up to win the doubles title, their seventh as a team. In the mixed doubles event Samantha Stosur won with Bob Bryan.|$|E

25|$|Nowadays {{they are}} a rare sight in Japanese cities, and only 30-35 {{professional}} chindon'ya (puro no chindon'ya) still exist, mostly in and around Tokyo, with another 30 amateur and hobby chindon'ya (shirōto chindon'ya) performing at festivals. In recent years, however, {{there seems to be}} a very small increase again, as they can draw on their historic roots to evoke nostalgia. The social status of the performers has also improved. Thus, while far away from their golden days, chindon'ya hold a small niche in the advertising business in Japan. In Osaka, for example, Chindon Tsūshinsha (ちんどん通信社) performs for clothing stores, politicians, beauty salons, and restaurants, in addition to stage performances on weddings, company parties, and other events. They expand their traditional roles even further and even provide a sort of religious services based on old folk rituals, even though they are not in any way priests. They have also performed outside Japan. Another group Adachi in Fukuoka was formed <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> and is still doing a good business, including new attractions as for example playing the saxophone while riding the unicycle, or displaying juggling, and balloon modelling performances.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{began the}} 2013 International season by {{retaining}} the Bill Kelly Memorial Trophy after another Anzac Test win. At {{the end of}} the year, Australia traveled up to play in the 2013 World Cup co-hosted by England and Wales. In their opening game against England, the Kangaroos were surprisingly facing a 0–10 scoreline after twenty minutes. But Australia went on to regain the control and go on to win the match by eight points. The England match was Australia's only 'scare' in the tournament as the Kangaroos went on to win and dominate all of their remaining matches, recording a 244–4 total aggregate score. They went on to earn revenge for their defeat to New Zealand <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> in the World Cup final to beat them this time around at the same stage. The final was watched in front of a record International rugby league attendance of 74,468 and in the match, five-eighth, Johnathan Thurston broke Mick Cronin's 31-year record of top point scorer after a conversion took him past the previous record of 309 points. This was the Kangaroos' tenth World Cup title. After the England game, Australia recorded five successive games without conceding a try in the tournament. This feat was one game off equaling the 1981–82 Australian team's record.|$|E
25|$|The West Indies cricket team {{travelled}} to Australia in November, playing three Tests {{against the}} Australian {{team for the}} Frank Worrell Trophy. After a 05 whitewash on the last tour of Australia <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> the West Indies were hoping for a better result, but they never ran Australia closer than seven wickets in a Test match. Australia were inserted in the first Test, and after a spell after lunch yielded three wickets for Corey Collymore and Australia were 111 for 4, Ricky Ponting put on a century stand with Adam Gilchrist, and double-digit contributions {{from the rest of}} the order (excluding the number 11 Glenn McGrath) gave Australia a total of 435. West Indies were then rolled over twice, for 210 and 129, with Australia batting to 283 for 2 declared in between, as they lost by 379 runs. The second Test saw the West Indies win the toss, bat, and surrender a 257-run first-innings lead. Dwayne Bravo hit a career-best 113 in the second innings, sharing a 182-run seventh-wicket stand which set a target of 78 for the Australians, but they still won by nine wickets. Brian Lara made an unbeaten double ton on the first day of the third Test, ending on 226 to set a Test career record with his 11,204 runs at the end of the match. However, Australia made 428 when they batted, Shane Warne took six for 80 and helped take the West Indies apart to 204 in the second innings, and Matthew Hayden's 87 not out gave Australia victory on the final day. The West Indies Cricket Board later lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council, regarding the umpiring decisions in the series, asking for video assessment of the decisions made. The ICC general manager Dave Richardson later acknowledged that errors had been made.|$|E
