[...] And by the end of 1961, Lowell had largely abandoned the idea of writing a libretto and instead redirected his energy to writing the three dramatic theater pieces that would make up the play The Old Glory. He finished writing a first draft of his play by early 1962, and by 1963, he'd begun working with the English director Jonathan Miller who'd expressed an interest in directing The Old Glory in New York.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the same}} letter, he {{contrasts}} Scotland and Holland. [...] "There hills and rocks intercept every prospect; {{here it is}} all a continued plain. There you might see a well-dressed duchess issuing from a dirty close, and here a dirty Dutchman inhabiting a palace.

60|$|Very dreadful, not a doubt. Alcohol is doomed; it {{is going}} it is gone.

6000|$|And Ely {{killed in}} October, Cromwell Dixon gone--the plucky youngster, Professor Montgomery, Nieuport, Todd Shriver whom Martin Dockerill and Hank Odell liked so much, and many others, all dead, like Moisant.

Captain Paul Beck once told me he {{believed}} it was mostly carelessness, these accidents, and he certainly is a good observer, but when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> careful constructor like Nieuport---- ...|$|E

[...] "Whenever I try {{to think}} of God as a spirit, I can see Hen Miller all wrapped up in a sheet an' runnin' us girls. We didn't know, an' it scared the life out of us. Little Maggie Murphy fainted dead away, and Beatrice Peralta fell an' scratched her face horrible. When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spirit all I can see is a white sheet runnin' in the dark. Just the same, God don't look like a Mexican, an' he don't wear his hair parted." ...|$|E

5000|$|In May 1963, after {{pitching}} a shutout, Ford announced {{he had given}} up smoking. He said, [...] "My doctor told me that whenever <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> smoking, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bus starting up and blowing the exhaust in my face." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{gave it to}} me, and I {{examined}} it more closely than I had done before. It was a cylinder of plain white shell hung on a gold chain, that which Bes had bitten through, but now mended again by taking out the broken link. On this cylinder were cut figures; as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> priest presenting a noble to a god, over whom was the crescent of the moon, while behind the god stood a man or demon with a tall spear. Also between the figures were mystic signs, meaning I know not what. The workmanship of the carving was grown shallow with time and use for the cylinder seemed to be very ancient, a sacred thing that had descended {{from generation to generation}} and was threaded through with a bar of silver on which it turned.|$|E
6000|$|My {{thoughts}} go {{into the}} woods and wildernesses and jungles of the world, to the wild life that shared man's suspension, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thousand feral acts interrupted and truncated--as it were frozen, like the frozen words Pantagruel met at sea. Not only men it was that were quieted, all living creatures that breathe the air became insensible, impassive things. Motionless brutes and birds lay amidst the drooping trees and herbage in the universal twilight, the tiger sprawled beside his fresh-struck victim, who bled to death in a dreamless sleep. The very flies came sailing down the air with wings outspread; the spider hung crumpled in his loaded net; like some gaily painted snowflake the butterfly drifted to earth and grounded, and was still. And as a queer contrast one gathers that the fishes in the sea suffered not at all. [...] .|$|E
60|$|Lying in bed {{would be}} an {{altogether}} perfect and supreme experience if only one had a coloured pencil long enough {{to draw on the}} ceiling. This, however, is not generally a part of the domestic apparatus on the premises. I think myself that the thing might be managed with several pails of Aspinall and a broom. Only if one worked in a really sweeping and masterly way, and laid on the colour in great washes, it might drip down again on one's face in floods of rich and mingled colour like some strange fairy rain; and that would have its disadvantages. I am afraid it would be necessary to stick to black and white in this form of artistic composition. To that purpose, indeed, the white ceiling would be of the greatest possible use; in fact, it is the only use <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> white ceiling being put to.|$|E

60|$|Have we not {{all such}} closets, my jolly friend, {{as well as}} the noble Marquis of Carabas? At night, when all the house is asleep but you, don't you get up and peep into yours? When you in your turn are slumbering, up gets Mrs. Brown from your side, steals downstairs like Amina to her ghoul, clicks open the secret door, and looks into her dark depository. Did she tell you of that little affair with Smith long before she knew you? Psha! who knows any one save himself alone? Who, in showing his house to the closest and dearest, doesn't keep back the key of a closet or two? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lovely reader laying down the page and looking over at her {{unconscious}} husband, asleep, perhaps, after dinner. Yes, madam, a closet he hath: and you, who pry into everything, shall never have the key of it. I think of some honest Othello pausing over this very sentence in a railroad carriage, and stealthily gazing at Desdemona opposite to him, innocently administering sandwiches to their little boy--I am trying to turn off the sentence with a joke, you see--I feel it is growing too dreadful, too serious.|$|E

I {{still think it}} need not prevent men from the completest social co-operation, but I see now better than I did {{how difficult it is}} for any man to purge from his mind the idea that he is not primarily a Jew, a Teuton, or a Kelt, but a man. You can persuade any one in five minutes that he or she belongs to some special and blessed and privileged sort of human being; it takes a lifetime to destroy that persuasion. There are these confounded differences of colour, of eye and brow, of nose or hair, small differences in themselves except that they give a foothold and foundation for tremendous fortifications of prejudice and tradition, in which hostilities and hatreds may gather. When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Jew's nose, a Chinaman's eyes or a negro's colour I am reminded of that fatal little pit which nature has left in the vermiform appendix, a thing no use in itself and of no significance, but a gathering-place for mischief. The extremest case of race-feeling is the Jewish case, and even here, I am convinced, it is the Bible and the Talmud and the exertions of those inevitable professional champions who live upon racial feeling, far more than their common distinction of blood, which holds this people together banded against mankind." ...|$|E
