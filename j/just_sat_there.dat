500|$|I got a call, {{they wanted}} me {{to be a part of}} that record. [...] It was {{actually}} the last day before Kanye had to turn the record in, and I think that pressure just made it that much more special to me. So I <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> approached the record openly and as straightforward as I could. When I laid the verse, 30 minutes later, I was extremely happy. I sent it to him, and he was too. I think it was one of the dopest verses I did this year." ...|$|E
500|$|Germain {{left the}} series in 1993, and several new writers {{replaced}} him. At that time, Nickelodeon permitted {{the writers and}} animators to include a storyline {{about the death of}} Chuckie's mother. The development of the Rugrats Mother's Day television special was announced on December 7, 1996. Kim Cattrall provided the voice for Chuckie's mother, Melinda Finster. Germain described the episode as [...] "this whole very maudlin thing," [...] and said that he was disappointed over his inability to cover the topic. He explained: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> thinking, 'We weren't allowed to do this, and now you guys are doing it.' That's something I regret." [...] Mary Harrington, a supervising producer of animation for Nickelodeon, described it as one of her favorite episodes of Rugrats, and commended the writers and producers for their handling of the subject matter.|$|E

500|$|... "How About a Friendly Shrink?" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times {{praised the}} episode and was particularly {{excited by the}} guest appearance by Jane Leeves. She called the subplot between Gaby and Susan was [...] "cute, but honest", but felt the Orson and Katherine characters have [...] "run their course". Entertainment Weekly writer Tanner Stransky declared the reappearance of Katherine Mayfair was the only interesting element of the episode, {{and that it was}} touching to see her realize the damage she had done. Stransky wrote, [...] "The rest of the story lines from last night <b>just</b> kind of <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> rather limply," [...] and said the Orson and Bree story, and Tom and Lynette's therapy, [...] "just seemed so dumpy for this once-sexy show".|$|R
5000|$|Other {{than perhaps}} Katherines loony bin storyline, Desperate Housewives [...] "How About a Friendly Shrink?" [...] didnt really push things forward, plot-wise, but its still {{good for a}} few laughs, and a few heart-wrenching scenes and dialogues, which {{as we all know}} is the minimum requirement. Glenn Diaz, BuddyTV [...] "How About a Friendly Shrink?" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times praised the episode and was particularly excited by the guest appearance by Jane Leeves.

500|$|Actress Georgia Taylor {{was cast}} as Toyah {{and the role}} marked her acting debut. Taylor was {{studying}} for her A-levels when she originally auditioned for the part of Zoe Tattersall. She was unsuccessful, so she then auditioned for Toyah and won the role. Of her casting, she explained [...] "When I got the call to say that I'd got the part I <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> open-mouthed, hugging my best friend. I could barely believe it. It is all very different than being on stage – it's not quite so intense because your audience isn't {{right there in front}} of you. But it's a very different type of satisfaction, working much faster with storylines and characters developing all the time." [...] At the time of her casting, Taylor was two years older than the character she portrayed.|$|E
500|$|Slipknot {{recorded}} Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses with producer Rick Rubin at The Mansion in Los Angeles, California in 2003. Earlier {{there had}} been speculation regarding {{the possibility of a}} third album and the band's future, as some members worked on other musical projects. After the album was completed, the band said that these side projects [...] "saved the band" [...] and [...] "helped [...] break out of the box [...] were in". Coming back together and working out their differences hindered the writing process initially. During an interview in 2008, drummer Joey Jordison said [...] "we didn't talk to each other for three months, we <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> wasting money in the fucking Houdini mansion." [...] Speaking retrospectively percussionist Shawn Crahan states; [...] "eventually we got sick of waiting for shit to happen. We got together, had a few beers and wrote a really artsy, fucked up song called 'Happy Ending'." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1967, {{the episode}} was {{received}} positively {{by members of}} the voice cast and their families, who had attended a preview screening at Century 21 Studios. Francis Matthews, who provided the voice of Captain Scarlet, recalls that [...] "the moment we heard, 'This is the voice of the Mysterons,' my eldest son ran screaming from the room, but my other son <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> riveted," [...] and adds, [...] "Reg [...] said, 'Oh my God, what have we done? We've made a series that no children are going to watch!'" [...] The episode was given a cinematic presentation at the Columbia Theatre on London's Shaftesbury Avenue, which Gary Files, a voice actor for later Captain Scarlet episodes, warmly remembers: [...] "I looked at [...] with total and utter amazement... Boy, you should have seen it on the wide screen! They had laid in an incredible soundtrack to go with it... We all tottered out into the night, convinced that we were on to a winner." [...] In his DVD commentary, Gerry Anderson praised Saunders' direction.|$|E
5000|$|... "Befour" [...] {{was first}} previewed in the behind-the-scenes video for Zayn's Fader cover in November 2015. During the session, he showed a few tracks, and claimed: [...] "I don’t feel like people {{really know what}} I’m going to give them, musically. And once they hear it, I feel like they will {{understand}} {{me a little bit}} more, and they’ll understand why I did what I did, and why I left the band, and why I had to write this shit down. Because for five—not even for five years, for ten years, this album has been in my brain, and it’s <b>just</b> been <b>there,</b> <b>sat</b> with me, needing to be out." [...] Later, on 17 March 2016, [...] "Befour" [...] was released as the third promotional single from the album, being instantly available to fans who pre-order the album on iTunes in advance of the album's release, on 25 March 2016.|$|R
5000|$|Lynn was {{inspired}} to compose [...] "I'm a Honky Tonk Girl" [...] from a woman she met while performing in a club in Washington state. As the woman became more intoxicated, she would tell Lynn more details of her story and would cry uncontrollably. The woman told Lynn of how her husband had left her for another woman. The pair developed a friendship that would last for several years. Lynn then wrote the song while leaning up against her home's bathroom toilet seat in twenty minutes, using a seventeen dollar guitar that her husband bought her as an anniversary present. She recounted the song's composition in 2010, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> down with my guitar...I was outside and leaning up against the toilet in Washington State. And I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and wrote 'Honky Tonk Girl' and 'Whispering Sea.'" ...|$|R

500|$|Lo {{found the}} {{shooting}} difficult and exhausting {{because she had}} to walk around with a 22-pound camera strapped around her waist for the three days of the filming. She also stated that it was [...] "draining" [...] to represent the pain she felt when she wrote the track. At one point during the filming, Lo was drunk and tired, so {{she decided to go}} into the bathroom stall; concerning this, the singer confessed that: [...] "I was wasted and tired and it was a tough recording and I really just went into the bathroom and sat there by myself. There weren't any people around then and I was just really alone in that stall. I <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and thought of anything that was happening during that time. The tears just came." [...] She also confessed that she barely remembered half of the recording. On 19 February 2014, she posted a teaser of the video on her Facebook account. On 17 March 2014, the music video was released via Lo's VEVO channel on YouTube, and was made available for consumption on the iTunes Store the next day.|$|E
500|$|After the April 10, 1967, {{recording}} session, the Experience {{spent the}} next two weeks playing shows and attending promotional appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC television program Monday Monday and BBC2's Late Night Line-Up. Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer completed the final mixing of Are You Experienced at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had agreed to audition the finished LP for Polydor's head of A, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so after a couple hours of sleep he prepared a suitable vinyl demo and traveled to Polydor. Chandler recalled: [...] "As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out in a cold sweat, thinking... when he hears this, he's going to order the men in white coats to take me away... Horst played the first side through and didn't say a word. Then he turned the disk over and played the other side. I started thinking about how I was going to talk my way out of this. At {{the end of the second}} side, he <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there.</b> Finally, he said, 'This is brilliant. This is the greatest thing I've ever heard.'" [...] Horst immediately became an ardent supporter of the album and the band, championing the marketing and distribution of their debut LP.|$|E
500|$|When {{talking about}} [...] "On the Floor", during an {{interview}} with MTV, Lopez said that she wanted a song that would evolve her sound, [...] "it feels like me today, which I like. It's not something that you hear and you're like, 'That's not her,' but you also go, 'Is that her? I like that. It's new,' and that's what I wanted. I {{wanted it to be}} very me, but I wanted it to be me not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played it for me, I made him play it 20 times in a row, and I <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... Because I really feel like, emotionally, I connected to it, but also because of how much I love to dance and how much that's always been such a big part of who I am since I started. Since I was a little girl, I just totally connected with the idea of getting out there." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Robert Canning of IGN said the episode was great {{and gave it}} an 8.8 out 10 rating, {{saying that he was}} [...] "impressed" [...] with how the ending handled Jack and Nancy's [...] "not-quite romance." [...] Canning enjoyed the [...] "platonic romance" [...] between them saying, [...] "A lesser series could have simply had the pair hook up, break up and move on, but 30 Rock has drawn out the relationship with flirtation, what-ifs and possible future ex-husbands." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, found the episode [...] "perfectly" [...] and [...] "well-timed". Leonard Pierce for The A.V. Club said that the episode started [...] "out wicked strong, with everyone in the cast getting great lines". In regards to the two plots, Pierce said that the Liz, TGS, and Dale Snitterman story was [...] "stuffed with great comedic moments", while the Jack and Nancy angle <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and flopped [...] "around like a dying fish." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad enjoyed the Boston theme in [...] "Winter Madness"; his only complaint was that the episode {{had nothing to do with}} TGS, the fictional show on 30 Rock. [...] "I'm getting a little tired of that. I want more sketches and NBC network shenanigans." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Jean, Jackson {{would not}} {{commit to the}} episode until after a {{read-through}} of the script was done. The read was held at Jackson's manager Sandy Gallin's house, and Dan Castellaneta (who provides the voice for Homer) was 30 minutes late. Jean recalls that [...] "no one said a word, we <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> waiting". Following the read, Jackson stipulated his conditions: he would record his speaking parts but not receive credit, and his singing voice would be performed by a sound-alike. Leon Kompowsky's singing parts were performed by Kipp Lennon, because Jackson wanted to play a joke on his brothers and fool them into thinking the impersonator was him. Lennon recorded his lines {{at the same time}} as Jackson, who found the impersonations humorous. Jackson showed up for the recording session alone and did not use the special trailer that was set up for him. According to Jean, Jackson did record versions of the singing parts, and while there have been rumors that those parts were the ones used in the final episode, The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma has stated the Lennon versions were used. Kompowsky's normal speaking voice, which is heard at the end of the episode, was recorded by cast member Hank Azaria. The episode originally was supposed to end with Kompowsky singing a portion of [...] "Man in the Mirror" [...] in his Michael Jackson voice as he walked down the road, but it was changed to him singing the beginning of [...] "Happy Birthday Lisa".|$|E

His wife, Rebecca, had been asking him to attend with her, and upon entering the church, McBrain soon found himself crying as he experienced a [...] "calling".

2500|$|Lin's {{complaints}} {{got worse}} {{with time and}} age. In the years before his death, the fiancee of Lin's son reported that Lin became extremely distant and socially and politically detached, even {{to the extent that}} he never read books or newspapers. His passivity made him difficult to connect with at any meaningful level: [...] "usually he <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> blankly". In Lin's rare periods of activity, he used his time mostly to complain about, and seek treatment for his large variety of medical issues.|$|E
2500|$|Paige {{returned}} to his hotel room. He recalled that the next morning, [...] "My stomach got sick with the pain that shot up my right arm. Sweat popped out all over me. The pain wouldn't quit. I tried lifting my arm. I couldn't. I <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> sweating, hurting enough to want to cry, getting sicker in the stomach and getting scared—real scared. My arm. I couldn't lift it."

[...] Plant's own explanation of the lyrics was that it [...] "was some cynical aside about a woman getting everything she wanted all the time without giving back any thought or consideration. The first line begins with that cynical sweep of the hand ... and it softened up after that.|$|E
5000|$|Teasing {{what can}} be {{expected}} of his first solo LP, Malik told Billboard: [...] "once they fans hear it, I feel like they will understand {{me a little bit}} more. For 10 years, this album has been in my brain, and it's <b>just</b> been <b>there,</b> <b>sat</b> with me, needing to be out." [...] Talking about the recording sessions with Billboard, Malik's main collaborator for the album James [...] "Malay" [...] Ho said they have gone to unusual lengths in pursuit of inspiration, for one [...] "we went camping for a week in the Angeles Forest - set up a generator and a tent so we could track in the woods." [...] James Ho is a Grammy Award winning producer, whose past work includes Frank Ocean's Channel Orange and Big Boi's Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty. [...] "I'll come down here recording room and record maybe seven songs a night," [...] Malik told the magazine. [...] "I’m enjoying what I’m doing. I’m not censoring myself anymore." ...|$|R

Even though he's become your pal and you're hanging out and having a laugh and going to dinner, {{as soon as he}} gets behind that [...] and he's doing his business, suddenly it's shudder time." [...] Orbison was given one solo track, [...] "Not Alone Anymore", on the album. His contributions were highly praised by the press. Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 spent 53 weeks on the US charts, peaking at number three. It reached No. 1 in Australia and topped out at No. 16 in the UK. The album won a Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group. Rolling Stone included it in the top 100 albums of the decade.|$|E
2500|$|The American {{reaction}} {{was that they}} would not apply any undue pressure on Israel to quit Lebanon as the Israeli presence in Lebanon may prove to be a catalyst for the disparate groups of Lebanon to make common cause against both Syrian and Israeli forces. Haig's analysis, which Ronald Reagan agreed with, was that this uniting of Lebanese groups would allow President Elias Sarkis to reform the Lebanese central Government and give the Palestinian refugees Lebanese citizenship. Additional evidence that the United States approved the Israeli invasion comes from longtime CIA analyst Charles Cogan, who says {{that he was in the}} room during a May 1982 meeting in The Pentagon during which Sharon explained to Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger [...] "in great detail how the Israelis were going to invade Lebanon... Weinberger <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and said nothing." ...|$|E

He <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> so we picked up the pace again. It was still no problem for him. I looked over my shoulder {{and he gave me}} a half-mocking, half-friendly grin. In the end, we went as hard as we could to try {{to get rid of him}} and teach the little brat a lesson, because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes. But whatever we did, he still hung on. After about an hour, we came into a village called Ploegsteert, at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said 'OK, I'm back home now, so 'bye. By the way, I'm Frank Vandenbroucke.' Neither of us had ever met a kid like him." ...|$|E
