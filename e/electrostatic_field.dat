25|$|In either formulation, Coulomb's law {{is fully}} {{accurate}} {{only when the}} objects are stationary, and remains approximately correct only for slow movement. These conditions are collectively known as the electrostatic approximation. When movement takes place, magnetic fields that alter the force on the two objects are produced. The magnetic interaction between moving charges may {{be thought of as}} a manifestation of the force from the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>field</b> but with Einstein's theory of relativity taken into consideration.|$|E
25|$|The Lorentz {{transformation}} of the electric field of a moving charge into a non-moving observer's reference frame results in {{the appearance of a}} mathematical term commonly called the magnetic field. Conversely, the magnetic field generated by a moving charge disappears and becomes a purely <b>electrostatic</b> <b>field</b> in a comoving frame of reference. Maxwell's equations are thus simply an empirical fit to special relativistic effects in a classical model of the Universe. As electric and magnetic fields are reference frame dependent and thus intertwined, one speaks of electromagnetic fields. Special relativity provides the transformation rules for how an electromagnetic field in one inertial frame appears in another inertial frame.|$|E
50|$|While it is {{possible}} to accelerate charged particles using <b>electrostatic</b> <b>fields,</b> like in a Cockcroft-Walton voltage multiplier, this method has limits given by electrical breakdown at high voltages.

25|$|Mica's {{value is}} based on its unique {{physical}} properties. It has a crystalline structure which forms layers which can be split (delaminated) into very thin sheets (0.125 to 0.025mm. or thinner), while remaining stable when exposed to electricity). This gives it superior electrical properties as an insulator and a dielectric, as it can support an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>field</b> while dissipating minimal {{energy in the form}} of heat. It also has a high dielectric breakdown and is resistant to corona discharge. It is also stable when exposed to light, moisture and extreme temperatures. Mica is also chemically inert, dielectric, elastic, flexible, hydrophilic, insulating, lightweight, platy, reflective, refractive, resilient, and ranges in opacity from transparent to opaque.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps can be {{illuminated}} by means {{other than a}} proper electrical connection. These other methods, however, result in very dim or very short-lived illumination, and so are seen mostly in science demonstrations. Static electricity or a Van de Graaff generator will cause a lamp to flash momentarily as it discharges a high voltage capacitance. A Tesla coil will pass high-frequency current through the tube, and since it has a high voltage as well, the gases within the tube will ionize and emit light. Capacitive coupling with high-voltage power lines can light a lamp continuously at low intensity, depending on {{the intensity of the}} <b>electrostatic</b> <b>field,</b> as shown in the image on the right.|$|E
25|$|As of 2014, {{the first}} stage in the {{acceleration}} process (pre-accelerator injector) takes place in two ion sources which turn hydrogen gas into H− ions. The gas is introduced into a container lined with molybdenum electrodes, each a matchbox-sized, oval-shaped cathode and a surrounding anode, separated by 1mm and {{held in place by}} glass ceramic insulators. A magnetron generates a plasma to form the ions near the metal surface. The ions are accelerated by the source to 35keV and matched by low energy beam transport (LEBT) into the radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) which applies a 750keV <b>electrostatic</b> <b>field</b> giving the ions their second acceleration. At the exit of RFQ, the beam is matched by medium energy beam transport (MEBT) into the entrance of the linear accelerator (linac).|$|E
40|$|An unsuspected {{agent is}} {{emerging}} as {{a key player in}} a number of processes relevant to space, solar and astrophysical systems: <b>electrostatic</b> <b>fields.</b> We focus here on two processes that are present both in space and laboratory plasmas. First, we consider the formation and properties of current sheets. Current sheets are key enablers for large scale system evolution: often large scale processes lead to the formation of thin sheets where small scale processes couple with larger scales. Our recent work proposes that small scales instabilities can produce <b>electrostatic</b> <b>fields</b> on large scales with profound effects on the evolution of the system where the sheet is present. In particular, their effect can lead to the onset of reconnection. Second, a recent discovery suggests that <b>electrostatic</b> <b>fields</b> can affect the evolution of confined plasmas in laboratory experiments [2] suggesting that <b>electrostatic</b> <b>fields</b> can be a major player in magnetic dynamo processes. Our work suggests that similar processes can be also at play in space and astrophysical plasmas. We report a number of simulations that put forward a new possibility: that <b>electrostatic</b> <b>fields</b> can be a major player in processes where magnetic field energy is created (dynamo) or destroyed (reconnection).

25|$|Discharge of an {{electric}} organ begins with central command from a medullary pacemaker that determines the frequency and rhythm of EODs. These two characteristics (frequency and rhythm) of EODs are {{also referred to as}} SPI- sequence of pulse intervals. The command from medullary pacemaker is then passed on by spinal electromotor neurons to electrocytes forming the electric organ, which determine the waveform of the EODs based on its morphophysiological properties. As command from pacemaker reaches electric organ, it opens up all the sodium channels, causing net sodium ion flux in one direction. The direction will either be towards or away from the head, and brings simultaneous depolarization of all electroycytes {{on the same side of}} cell. The result is a positive polarity at the fish's head relative to the tail, or vice versa: a dipole system. The polarity built up by the electric organ therefore sets up an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>field</b> in the water.|$|E
25|$|Photons {{hitting a}} thin film of alkali metal or {{semiconductor}} material such as gallium arsenide in an image intensifier tube cause the ejection of photoelectrons due to the photoelectric effect. These are accelerated by an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>field</b> where they strike a phosphor coated screen, converting the electrons back into photons. Intensification of the signal is achieved either through acceleration of the electrons or by {{increasing the number of}} electrons through secondary emissions, such as with a micro-channel plate. Sometimes a combination of both methods is used. Additional kinetic energy is required to move an electron out of the conduction band and into the vacuum level. This is known as the electron affinity of the photocathode and is another barrier to photoemission other than the forbidden band, explained by the band gap model. Some materials such as Gallium Arsenide have an effective electron affinity that is below the level of the conduction band. In these materials, electrons that move to the conduction band are all of sufficient energy to be emitted from the material and as such, the film that absorbs photons can be quite thick. These materials are known as negative electron affinity materials.|$|E
25|$|While {{the third}} {{generation}} of tubes were fundamentally {{the same as the}} second generation, they possessed two significant differences. Firstly, they used a GaAs—CsO—AlGaAs photocathode, which is more sensitive in the 800nm-900nm range than second-generation photocathodes. Secondly, the photocathode exhibits negative electron affinity (NEA), which provides photoelectrons that are excited to the conduction band a free ride to the vacuum band as the Cesium Oxide layer {{at the edge of the}} photocathode causes sufficient band-bending. This makes the photocathode very efficient at creating photoelectrons from photons. The Achilles heel of third generation photocathodes, however, is that they are seriously degraded by positive ion poisoning. Due to the high <b>electrostatic</b> <b>field</b> stresses in the tube, and the operation of the MicroChannel Plate, this led to the failure of the photocathode within a short period - as little as 100 hours before photocathode sensitivity dropped below Gen2 levels. To protect the photocathode from positive ions and gases produced by the MCP, they introduced a thin film of sintered aluminium oxide attached to the MCP. The high sensitivity of this photocathode, greater than 900 µA/lm, allows more effective low light response, though this was offset by the thin film, which typically blocked up to 50% of electrons.|$|E

25|$|Radioactive {{beams of}} {{specific}} isotopes {{are widely used}} {{in the fields of}} experimental physics, biology and materials science. The production and formation of these radioactive atoms into an ionic beam for study is an entire field of research carried out at many laboratories throughout the world. The first isotope separator was developed at the Copenhagen Cyclotron by Bohr and coworkers using the principle of electromagnetic separation. Today, there are many laboratories around the world that supply beams of radioactive ions for use. Arguably the principal Isotope Separator On Line (ISOL) is ISOLDE at CERN, which is a joint European facility spread across the Franco-Swiss border near the city of Geneva. This laboratory uses mainly proton spallation of uranium carbide targets to produce a wide range of radioactive fission fragments that are not found naturally on earth. During spallation (bombardment with high energy protons), a uranium carbide target is heated to several thousand degrees so that radioactive atoms produced in the nuclear reaction are released. Once out of the target, the vapour of radioactive atoms travels to an ionizer cavity. This ionizer cavity is a thin tube made of a refractory metal with a high work function allowing for collisions with the walls to liberate a single electron from a free atom (surface ionization effect). Once ionized, the radioactive species are accelerated by an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>field</b> and injected into an electromagnetic separator. As ions entering the separator are of approximately equal energy, those ions with a smaller mass will be deflected by the magnetic field by a greater amount than those with a heavier mass. This differing radius of curvature allows for isobaric purification to take place. Once purified isobarically, the ion beam is then sent to the individual experiments. In order to increase the purity of the isobaric beam, laser ionization can take place inside the ionizer cavity to selectively ionize a single element chain of interest. At CERN, this device is called the Resonance Ionization Laser Ion Source (RILIS). Currently over 60% of all experiments opt to use the RILIS to increase the purity of radioactive beams.|$|E
