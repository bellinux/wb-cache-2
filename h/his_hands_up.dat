25|$|In Olai's account, {{the battle}} was going badly, and defeat seemed imminent. However the Danish Bishop Anders Sunesen {{on top of a}} hill {{overlooking}} the battle prayed to God with his arms raised, which meant that the Danes moved closer to victory the more he prayed. When he raised his arms the Danes surged forward and when his arms grew tired and he let them fall, the Estonians turned the Danes back. Attendants rushed forward to raise his arms once again and the Danes surged forward again. At a second he was so tired in his arms that he dropped them and the Danes then lost the advantage and were moving closer to defeat. He needed two soldiers to keep <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> and when the Danes were about to lose, 'Dannebrog' miraculously fell from the sky and the King took it, showed it to the troops and their hearts were filled with courage and the Danes won the battle.|$|E
25|$|Mătăsăreanu's {{vehicle was}} {{rendered}} inoperable after {{two of its}} tires were shot out and the windshield covered in bullet holes. At 9:56 am, he attempted to carjack a yellow 1963 Jeep Gladiator on Archwood by shooting at the driver who fled on foot, three blocks east of where Phillips died. He quickly transferred all of his weapons and ammunition from the getaway car, {{but was unable to}} operate the Jeep due to him being unfamiliar with the stick-shift vehicle. As KCBS and KCAL helicopters hovered overhead, a patrol car driven by SWAT officers quickly arrived and stopped {{on the opposite side of}} the truck to where the Chevrolet was stopped. Mătăsăreanu left the truck, took cover behind the original getaway car, and engaged them for two-and-a-half minutes of almost uninterrupted gunfire. Mătăsăreanu's chest armor deflected a double tap from one of the SWAT officers, which briefly winded him before he continued firing. At least one SWAT officer fired his AR-15 below the cars and wounded Mătăsăreanu in his unprotected lower legs; he was soon unable to continue and put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> to show surrender.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Underbelly," [...] the Devil hints that Sam is invulnerable. In the Season 1 Finale Sam learns that can stop an impact with hands. A washing machine falls on Sam, but raises <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> and he stops the washing machine. The {{only thing that}} can kill Sam is his father the Devil, God, and {{possibly}} other higher beings such as angels. However, that does not stop him from bleeding, getting injured or knocked out.|$|E

2500|$|The assassin Malik Mumtaz Hussain Qadri {{was from}} Punjab, and {{was part of}} the {{security}} detail provided to Taseer by the Elite Police. After the shooting, Qadri threw his weapon down and put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> when one of his colleagues aimed at him. He reportedly pleaded to be arrested. [...] After the murder, more than 500 clerics voiced support for the crime and urged a general boycott of Taseer's funeral. Supporters of Mumtaz Qadri blocked police attempting to bring him to the Anti-Terrorism Court in Rawalpindi, and some supporters showered him with rose petals.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of his}} stage act, Lewis {{pounded the}} keys with his heel, kicked the piano bench aside and played standing, raking <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> and down the {{keyboard}} for dramatic effect, sat on the keyboard and even stood {{on top of the}} instrument. Lewis told the Pop Chronicles that kicking over the bench originally happened by accident, but when it got a favorable response, he kept it in the act. His first TV appearance, in which he demonstrated some of these moves, was on The Steve Allen Show on July 28, 1957, where he played [...] "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On".|$|E
2500|$|As {{a senior}} in 1947, Mann starred on Crisler's undefeated {{national}} championship team. [...] During the 1947 season, Mann caught 12 passes for 302 yards and three touchdowns. [...] He also ran for 129 yards on 15 end-around plays. [...] Against Stanford, Mann caught a 61-yard touchdown pass from Chappuis on Michigan's second play from scrimmage. [...] The Chicago Daily Tribune described the plays as follows: [...] "Stanford today was like a boxer taking a Joe Louis knockout punch before having {{a chance to get}} <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up.</b> [...] On the second play after the opening kickoff, Bob Chappuis hurled a touchdown pass to dusky Bob Mann for 61 yards." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cortez motioned {{the fighters}} back {{together}} {{to resume the}} fight, without putting them in a neutral corner. Both fighters touched gloves, and Ortiz gave Mayweather another hug. At that moment, Cortez was {{not looking at the}} fighters. As Ortiz let go, Mayweather took advantage of Ortiz not having <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> and unloaded a left hook which wobbled Ortiz. Ortiz then looked at the referee, and Mayweather connected with a flush right hand to Ortiz's face. Ortiz fell to the canvas, and was unable to beat Cortez's count as the crowd of 14,687 jeered Mayweather. After the fight Ortiz claimed that he was merely obeying the referee's instructions when he was [...] "blindsided" [...] by Mayweather, who defended his actions by saying that [...] "In the ring, you have to protect yourself at all times".|$|E
2500|$|Next {{the defense}} called Thomas Shoatman to the stand. Shoatman {{had been present}} when Celia had been {{questioned}} by Jefferson Jones in July, after her arrest.The defense questioned Shoatman about the reasons Celia had given for striking Newsom {{the first and second}} times. Shoatman testified that Celia had said that she struck Newsom the first time [...] "only to hurt him, to keep him from having sexual intercourse with her" [...] (although the phrase [...] "to keep him from having sexual intercourse with her" [...] was stricken from the record after an objection from the prosecution), and that she had struck the second blow because [...] "he threw <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up,</b> that she was afraid he would catch her." [...] With Thomas Shoatman's testimony, the defense attempted to convince the jurors that Celia had been acting in self-defense when she had killed Newsom.|$|E
2500|$|Harrison {{spent two}} years {{on and off the}} {{practice}} squad for the Steelers, being released three times, and also was briefly on the active roster {{towards the end of the}} 2002 season, playing only special teams. [...] Teammate and fellow linebacker, James Farrior, later told NFL Network that Harrison was so green early on in his career that he would simply [...] "give up" [...] on plays on which he was struggling and even would ask the coaches not to play him when he was struggling. Farrior said, [...] "He was a knucklehead that didn't know the plays. We'd be in practice, in training camp, and he might not know what he was doing so he'd just stop and throw <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> and tell (the coaches) to get him out of there. We thought the guy was crazy." ...|$|E

2500|$|As mayor, Rizzo's {{handling}} of the first MOVE incident in 1978 has been interpreted as supporting the charge of racism. The radical group lived in squalid conditions, with infestations of rats encroaching on adjacent properties [...] When {{members of the group}} refused entrance to city inspectors and social services agents, Rizzo evicted them through police action. Officer James Ramp was killed in the conflict, and 16 other police and firefighters injured. Though MOVE members disagreed, it was claimed that Officer James Ramp was killed by MOVE gunfire. Eventually, the standoff was resolved without further loss of life, and the members of MOVE were arrested. One unarmed MOVE member, Delbert Africa, was beaten by multiple officers while leaving the MOVE house with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up.</b> The incident as captured by the local news media shows Africa being dragged by his hair, struck with an officer's helmet, and kicked in the face and groin once on the ground.|$|E
2500|$|... (A PT is {{a patrol}} torpedo boat and a bluejacket is an enlisted sailor.) These incidents, {{along with many other}} perfidious actions of the Japanese {{throughout}} the Pacific War, led to an American tendency to shoot the dead or wounded Japanese soldiers and those who were attempting to surrender and not take them as prisoners of war easily. Two Marines of Iwo Jima told cautionary tales. One confided: [...] "They always told you take prisoners but we had some bad experiences on Saipan taking prisoners, you take them and then as soon as they get behind the lines they drop grenades and you lose a few more people. You get a little bit leery of taking prisoners when they are fighting to the death and so are you." [...] The other reported, [...] "Very few of them came out on their own; when they did, why, usually one in the front he'd come out with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> and one behind him, he'd come out with a grenade." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{information}} {{reported to the}} press {{on the day of}} the shooting by Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association President Jeffrey Follmer, [...] " [...] pulled into the parking lot and saw a few people sitting underneath a pavilion next to the center. [...] saw a black gun sitting on the table, and he saw the boy pick up the gun and put it in his waistband." [...] Also on that date, Cleveland Deputy Chief Tomba stated, [...] "The officer got out of the car and told the boy to put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up.</b> The boy reached into his waistband, pulled out the gun and [...] fired two shots." [...] According to Chief Tomba, [...] "the child did not threaten the officer verbally or physically." [...] On November 26, the day a video of the shooting was released, Chief Tomba is quoted as saying, [...] "Loehmann shouted from the car three times at Tamir to show his hands as he approached the car." [...] The entire incident happened in less than two seconds. The officers later found that the gun was an Airsoft gun which had had its orange safety tip removed. [...] These weapons are actual size replicas of real guns, designed to shoot non-lethal plastic pellets.|$|E

2500|$|The Lewiston area traces {{its roots}} to 1669 {{with the early}} {{presence}} of the Androscoggin tribe (the namesake of the county the city resides in). In the late 18th century, the area slowly became populated by New French families and was incorporated as [...] "Lewistown" [...] in 1795. The presence of the Androscoggin River and Lewistown Falls made the town an attractive area for manufacturing and hydro-power businesses. The rise of Boston rail and textile tycoon Benjamin Bates saw rapid economic growth rivaling that of Cambridge, Worcester, and Concord. The increase in economic stimulus prompted thousands of Quebecers to migrate causing a population boom; the populace rose from 1,801 in 1840 to 21,701 in 1890. During the mid-19th century, Lewistown was the wealthiest,] and most rapidly growing city in Maine and began to develop a distinct upper-class in the Frye Street District. The Bates Mills (numbered 1-5) employed thousands of Lewistown locals, Canadians, and Europeans maintaining itself as the largest employer for three decades. The town's reationship with Bates was strained with the 1861 Lewistown cotton riots, but gradually improved over time during the American Civil War. During the war, local preacher Oren Burbank Cheney founded the Maine State Seminary, the first coeducational university in New England {{and one of the}} first universities to admit black students before the Emancipation Proclamation. Lewistown quickly became associated with the liberal arts and was incorporated as [...] "Lewiston" [...] in 1864, a year before the college was chartered as Bates College. The mid-20th century saw the expansion of textile investments and the 5,000-person Lewiston-Auburn Shoe Strike of 1937. Lewiston was the final stop of John F. Kennedy before he assumed his presidency; he spoke at a park now known as [...] "Kennedy Park." [...] It was also the site of the 1965 Muhammid Ali vs Sonny Liston rematch, where the iconic photo of Ali standing over Liston with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> was taken.|$|E
