25|$|In {{a review}} by Gadget lab, {{disputes}} that the contrast was higher and actually {{states that the}} font appears to be fuzzier {{than that of the}} first generation Kindle. The review {{goes on to say that}} changes to the Kindle 2 have made it tougher to read the smaller font sizes that most books use. Some writers discuss how the <b>font</b> <b>size</b> is at times worse than that of the first generation Kindle. It appears that whether the Kindle 2 is clearer or fuzzier than the prior model depends on the <b>font</b> <b>size.</b>|$|E

Web-integrated {{crystal structure}} visualization is tailored for examining crystal structures in web browsers, often supporting wide color spectra (up to 32 bit) and window size adaptation.

This made composite video connected TVs incapable of decoding the captions on their own. Also, these pre-rendered subtitles use classic caption style opaque backgrounds with an overly large <b>font</b> <b>size</b> and obscure the picture more than the more modern, partially transparent backgrounds.|$|E
25|$|In the 1997–98 season, the Sixers {{drastically}} {{changed their}} logo and colors {{in an effort}} to appeal to a more youthful, hip-hop oriented culture. The iconic 76 logo was dropped, and a new logo was introduced, featuring a bigger 76ers script, with a single star behind the number 7 and a streaking basketball below. More controversially, gold and black were introduced to the color scheme, along with red, white and blue. Uniforms were primarily white (home), and black (away), with slight adjustments in the home logo lettering (gold 1997–2000, black 2000–09), trim and piping. Until the 2006–07 season, player names featured a red trim, before dropping it altogether and shrunk the <b>font</b> <b>size</b> in the 2007–08 season; the alternates adopted this design that season, with the regular uniforms following suit that same season. A blue alternate uniform was worn 1999–2006, while a red alternate uniform, featuring a return to the 'PHILA' script in then-current lettering, was worn 2006–09. This logo and color scheme were used until the 2008–09 season.|$|E

25|$|From 16 March 2015, Opera Mini's extreme {{compression}} mode uses an upgraded {{version of the}} Presto layout engine that is included in Opera 12. Consequently, Opera Mini supports most of the web standards supported in Opera 12. Presto's development has continued for Opera Mini and further support was added for HTML5 input types, CSS Flexbox model, CSS rem units and ECMAScript 5. However, unlike the desktop edition of Opera, frames are flattened because of client limitations, and dotted or dashed borders are displayed as solid borders due to bandwidth and memory issues. As Opera Mini reformats web pages, it does not pass the Acid2 standards compliance test. Opera Mini supports bi-directional text, meaning that it can correctly display right-to-left scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew in addition to languages written left-to-right. However, it will not display right-to-left text if the <b>font</b> <b>size</b> is set to small or very small. Indic and Chinese scripts are supported only if an appropriate font is installed on the device as the default system font.|$|E
500|$|The {{team also}} faced several {{technical}} issues, such as {{dealing with a}} fixed <b>font</b> <b>size,</b> and having to type in additional symbols using language input keys so the code would function. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer's spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. To complicate matters, the Japanese text used obscure kanji symbols carried over from Chinese writing. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee Richard Honeywood as the [...] "old comic book '@#$%!'-type replacement". The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication. [...] For the PC port, Square did its best to fix translation and grammar mistakes for the North American and European versions, but {{did not have the}} time and budget to retranslate all the text. According to Honeywood, the success of Final Fantasy VII in the West encouraged Square to focus more on localization quality; on future games, Square hired additional translators and editors, while also streamlining communication between the development and localization teams.|$|E
500|$|Barlow {{decided to}} feature live action footage {{in the game}} after {{becoming}} frustrated with his previous projects, particularly with the technical challenge of translating an actor's performance into a game engine. Barlow set out to work with an actor on Her Story, having enjoyed the process while working at Climax Studio, albeit with a larger budget. He contacted Viva Seifert, whom he had intermittently worked with on [...] for a year, before its cancellation. He felt that Seifert is [...] "very good at picking up a line and intuitively pulling {{a lot of the}} subtext into her performance", which led him to believe that she was [...] "perfect" [...] for the role in Her Story. When Barlow asked Seifert to audition, he sent her a 300-page script, which he managed to reduce to 80 pages, by altering <b>font</b> <b>size,</b> as well as some dialogue; she accepted the role. Seifert began to feel pressure midway through filming, when she realised that [...] "the whole game is hinging" [...] on her performance. She described the shoot as [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "rather exhausting", and felt as if she was [...] "subtly being scrutinised" [...] by Barlow, which helped her performance. Barlow also felt that the intensity helped Seifert's performance, taking cues from director Alfred Hitchcock, who would upset his actors in order to achieve the greatest performance. Seifert felt that there were small nuances in her performance that may have [...] "added some twists and turns" [...] for players that Barlow had not anticipated. The game's seven police interviews were filmed roughly in chronological order over five days, in a process that Barlow called [...] "natural". Barlow travelled to Seifert's home county of Cornwall to film. He felt that finding the locations for the interrogation rooms was the simplest part of production, because [...] "everywhere has crappy looking rooms", with footage being recorded in a council building in Truro. When filming was complete, Barlow wanted {{to give the impression that}} the videos had been recorded in 1994, but found digital filters were unable to capture this time frame appropriately. Instead, he recorded the footage through two VHS players to create imperfections in the video before digitising the video into the game.|$|E

[...] While the TAKS-M items use simplified wording, content is still assessed on grade level. [...] Only 2% of students per district will be permissibly scored as [...] "Proficient" [...] using the TAKS-M. TAKS-Alt (alternative) has a 1% permissibility ceiling and is for students facing significant cognitive disabilities.|$|E

Specifically, h1 means [...] "this is a first-level heading", p means [...] "this is a paragraph", and em means [...] "this is an emphasized word or phrase". A program interpreting such structural markup may apply its own rules or styles for presenting the various pieces of text, using different typefaces, boldness, <b>font</b> <b>size,</b> indentation, colour, or other styles, as desired.|$|E
2500|$|The typeball {{elements}} for the Selectric Composer would physically fit on a Selectric, and vice versa, {{but they could}} not actually be used on each other's machines, because the characters were arranged differently around the element and were also positioned differently within each character area. Selectric Composer elements can be identified by a colored index arrow (the color is used to set a median character width on the machine) and an abbreviated series of letters and numbers identifying the <b>font,</b> <b>size,</b> and variation, for example [...] "UN-11-B" [...] for Univers 11-point bold (Adrian Frutiger had adapted his Univers font specifically for the Selectric Composer).|$|E
2500|$|Since 2005, most British post boxes {{have had}} the time of only the last {{collection}} of the day listed on the box, with no indication of whether the box is cleared at other times earlier in the day.

The [...] "Next Collection" [...] tablet, where fitted, was usually retained in these cases, but tablets now merely show the day of the week, indicating whether or not the last collection has been cleared that day.|$|E
