We present a linear time algorithm for the deduction for the interiors {{and show that}} it is co-NP-complete for the deduction for the <b>exteriors.</b> Under model-based representation, we show that the deduction problem for interiors is NP-complete while the one for <b>exteriors</b> is co-NP-complete. As for Horn envelopes of the <b>exteriors,</b> we show that it is linearly solvable under model-based representation, while it is co-NP-complete under formula-based representation. We also discuss the polynomially solvable cases for all the intractable problems...|$|R

5|$|The {{building}} {{opened on}} October 3, 1998, with a two-story atrium gallery, curves located throughout the interior space, marble panels, and an enclosed garden on the <b>exterior.</b> Additionally, the brick faced structure has an <b>exterior</b> patio constructed of slate. There are {{a total of}} six galleries at the museum, with four used for permanent collections and two galleries used for traveling exhibits. In 2008, colored reflector panels were added to the narrow second floor windows in order to provide more color to the <b>exterior.</b> Measuring 69.5 inches high by 21.75 inches wide, some of the panels are illuminated from the interior.|$|E
5|$|The <b>exterior</b> of Kazakhstan nuclear {{facility}} {{was shot at}} the Bardenas Reales, in Navarre, Spain, and the <b>exterior</b> of the oil refinery control centre at the Motorola building in Groundwell, Swindon. The <b>exterior</b> of the oil pipeline was filmed in Cwm Dyli, Snowdonia, Wales, while the production teams shot the oil pipeline explosion in Hankley Common, Elstead, Surrey. Istanbul, Turkey, was indeed used in the film and Elektra King's Baku villa was actually in the city, also using the famous Maiden's Tower which was used as Renard's hideout in Turkey. The underwater submarine scenes were filmed in The Bahamas.|$|E

5|$|For Batman Begins, Nolan {{preferred}} traditional stuntwork over computer-generated imagery. Scale {{models were}} used to represent the Narrows and Ra's al Ghul's temple. There were, however, several establishing shots that were CG composite images; that is, an image composed of multiple images. Examples include Gotham's skyline, <b>exterior</b> shots of Wayne Tower, {{and some of the}} <b>exterior</b> monorail shots. The climactic monorail sequence mixed live action footage, model work, and CGI.|$|E

5|$|For the <b>exterior,</b> Burges re-used some of {{his earlier}} unexecuted plans, the overall design from the Crimea Memorial Church and St John's Cathedral, Brisbane, the {{elevations}} from Lille Cathedral. The main problem of the building was its size. Despite the prodigious efforts of its fundraisers, and despite Burges exceeding the original budget, Cork was still unable to afford a really large cathedral. Burges overcame this obstacle by using the grandeur of his three-spired <b>exterior</b> to offset the lesser scale of {{the remainder of the}} building.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1920s, New York's {{metropolitan}} area surpassed London's as the world's most populous {{metropolitan area}}. New York City's metropolitan area exceeded ten {{million by the}} early 1930s. The economic boom of the 1920s and the great speculation {{of the real estate}} market fostered a new wave of skyscraper projects in the city. The 1916 Zoning Resolution restricted the height that the street-side <b>exterior</b> walls of New York City buildings could rise before they needed to incorporate setbacks that recessed the buildings' <b>exterior</b> walls away from the streets. This led to the construction of Art Deco structures in New York City with significant setbacks, large volumes, and striking silhouettes that were often decorated elaborately.|$|E
