25|$|On 31 March 2017, it was {{revealed}} on the YouTube channel of Corrie {{that some of the}} soap's cast would sing a specially-written lyric, of which will be added to the new theme song that will be played, as of the first episode of the evening of Monday, April 3, 2017, but it turned out it was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b>|$|E
500|$|As a solo artist he {{recorded}} a song, [...] "X-M@$", for The Teenage Cancer Trust. The single was {{made available to}} digital retailers on December 12, 2010. It debuted at number thirty-seven in the UK. Taylor clarified on YouTube that the song was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about people who don't enjoy Christmas. He personally loves Christmas especially {{due to the fact}} he gets to see his extended family but finds the frustration of people who don't like it to be hilarious.|$|E
500|$|In {{a session}} of Prime Minister's Questions some weeks later, David Cameron {{challenged}} Brown to concede on record that [...] "no deals were done" [...] in ensuring {{the bill was}} passed. Brown stood before the House and said, [...] "yes". Cameron quoted from a letter written by Labour's Chief Whip Geoff Hoon to Keith Vazthe Chairman of the Home Affairs Committeein which Hoon expressed deep thanks for Vaz's support and closed the letter with the line, [...] "I trust {{that you will be}} appropriately rewarded". Hoon said that this was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> between friends but others, such as Conservative leader David Cameron and Shadow Home Secretary David Davis viewed this letter as proof that deals were indeed done behind the scenes and that Brown lied on the record when he said there had been none. The House of Lords defeated the bill, which Lords said was [...] "fatally flawed, ill thought through and unnecessary", stating that [...] "it seeks to further erode...fundamental legal and civil rights".|$|E
50|$|In {{the pilot}} {{episode of the}} series, Bo commented (possibly <b>just</b> as <b>a</b> <b>joke)</b> that Luke's {{probably}} the father {{of at least two}} of the children who live at the Hazzard County Orphanage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! now you're quizzing. That's {{always the}} way with you gentlemen {{when you get a}} little up in the world. You don't think women are worth talking to then, unless <b>just</b> for <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> or so." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{representation}} struck Tom as so comical that he {{was compelled}} to laugh outright; he simply couldn't help it. It was <b>just</b> such <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> as he might have played years before, perhaps on old Josiah Crabtree, when at Putnam Hall.|$|R
500|$|... "Paranoid Android" [...] is {{categorised}} {{by three}} distinct moods written in what Yorke {{referred to as}} three different states of mind. The song's lyrics tie in {{with a number of}} themes common in OK Computer, including insanity, violence, slogans, and political objection to capitalism. Yorke's lyrics were based on an unpleasant experience at a Los Angeles bar during which he was surrounded by strangers high on cocaine. In particular, Yorke was frightened by a woman who became violent after someone spilled a drink on her. Yorke characterised the woman as [...] "inhuman", and said [...] "There was a look in this woman's eyes that I'd never seen before anywhere.... Couldn't sleep that night because of it." [...] The woman inspired the line [...] "kicking squealing Gucci little piggy" [...] in the song's second section. Yorke, referring to the line [...] "With your opinions, which are of no consequence at all", said that [...] "Again, that's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> It's actually the other way around– it's actually my opinion that is of no consequence at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive Sidney Sheinberg {{made some}} {{suggestions}} to the script, changing Marty's mother's name from Meg to Lorraine (the {{name of his}} wife, actress Lorraine Gary), to change Brown's name from Professor Brown to Doc Brown and replace his pet chimpanzee with a dog. Sheinberg also wanted the title changed to Spaceman from Pluto, convinced no successful film ever had [...] "future" [...] in the title. He suggested Marty introduce himself as [...] "Darth Vader from the planet Pluto" [...] while dressed as an alien forcing his dad to ask out his mom (rather than [...] "the planet Vulcan"), and that the farmer's son's comic book be titled Spaceman from Pluto rather than Space Zombies from Pluto. Appalled by the new title that Sheinberg wanted to impose, Zemeckis asked Spielberg for help. Spielberg subsequently dictated a memo back to Sheinberg, wherein Spielberg convinced him they thought his title was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> thus embarrassing him into dropping the idea. In addition, the original climax was deemed too expensive by Universal executives and was simplified by keeping the plot within Hill Valley and incorporating the clocktower sequence. Spielberg later used the omitted refrigerator and Nevada nuclear site elements in his film Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Born Again tour in March 1984, vocalist Ian Gillan left Black Sabbath to re-join Deep Purple, which was reforming after a long hiatus. Bevan left at the same time, and Gillan remarked that he and Bevan were made to feel like [...] "hired help" [...] by Iommi. The band then recruited an unknown Los Angeles vocalist named David Donato. The new line-up wrote and rehearsed throughout 1984, and eventually recorded a demo with producer Bob Ezrin in October. Unhappy with the results, the band parted ways with Donato shortly after. Disillusioned with the band's revolving line-up, bassist Geezer Butler quit Black Sabbath in November 1984 to form a solo band. [...] "When Ian Gillan took over {{that was the end of}} it for me", Butler later said. [...] "I thought it was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> and I just totally left. When we got together with Gillan it was not supposed to be a Black Sabbath album. After we had done the album we gave it to Warner Bros. and they said they were going to put it out as a Black Sabbath album and we didn't have a leg to stand on. I got really disillusioned with it and Gillan was really pissed off about it. That lasted one album and one tour and then that was it." ...|$|E
6000|$|On her way, disbelief assailed her. [...] "I don't {{see how the}} man did it!" [...] she mentally declared. [...] "I {{wonder if}} that item is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> huge <b>joke,</b> because the picture {{was so bad that}} the {{reporter}} tried to be ironical." ...|$|R
5000|$|So as <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> and as <b>an</b> {{homage to}} Wes Craven I took a Hills Have Eyes poster and in Evil Dead I {{put it in}} the cellar in one of the sets. And I ripped it in half, to say [...] "No Wes, your picture is pop horror, this is real horror." [...] But <b>just</b> as <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> of course.|$|R
5000|$|The Italian {{version is}} Ammazza la vecchia... col Flit! [...] "Kill {{the old lady}} with Flit!" [...] - Flit. This is a humorous popular version of a post-World War II {{commercial}} Ammazza la mosca... col Flit [...] "Kill the fly with Flit!". This version is never perceived as offensive, but <b>just</b> as <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b>|$|R
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the comment later, {{he said that he}} didn't care about being [...] "politically incorrect." [...] Klein defended Wurzelbacher, telling reporters his {{comments}} were <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Jezabels are an Australian indie {{rock band}} formed in Sydney in 2007. They consist of Hayley Mary (also known as Hayley Frances McGlone) on lead vocals, Heather Shannon on piano and keyboard, Nik Kaloper on drums and percussion, and Samuel Lockwood on lead guitar. They have {{described}} their genre as [...] "intensindie" [...] but later {{said that this}} was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> that they put up on a social networking site, though people took them seriously.|$|E
2500|$|As Act1 progresses, Jimmy {{becomes more}} and more vituperative, {{transferring}} his contempt for Alison's family onto her personally, calling her [...] "pusillanimous" [...] and generally belittling her to Cliff. It is possible to play this scene as though Jimmy thinks everything is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> but most actors opt for playing it as though he really is excoriating her. The tirade ends with some physical horseplay, resulting in the ironing board overturning and Alison's arm getting a burn. Jimmy exits to play his trumpet off stage.|$|E
5000|$|... "Malibu Nightmare" [...] (which {{is on the}} 12" [...] single) was {{originally}} featured on the EP for the song [...] "Love's An Injection" [...] in 1982. The song {{was originally}} made <b>just</b> as <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> which had Nasty Suicide on bass, because Sam Yaffa was late from the recording. It was re-recorded on the band's 1983 album Back to Mystery City.|$|R
40|$|Through the {{narration}} of a dream, the article seeks {{to account for}} the fact that the formations of the unconscious are possible whenever subjects are involved in the social fabric. <b>Just</b> as <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> is <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> because there is someone to laugh at it, a dream, when it is narrated, becomes a text to be read. Subjects resort to these formations when they feel trapped due to an approximation to the real. Although the real appears as a boundary that halts writing, it is also the condition of possibility of subjective production...|$|R
60|$|It was Lawyer Maxwell's turn {{to become}} dumb. In his {{astonished}} abstraction {{he forgot to}} wipe his mouth, and gazed at Gabriel with his nervous smile as if his client had <b>just</b> perpetrated <b>a</b> practical <b>joke</b> of the first magnitude.|$|R
2500|$|The {{series was}} often {{described}} as [...] "a show about nothing". However, Seinfeld in 2014 stated [...] "the pitch for the show, the real pitch, when Larry and I went to NBC in 1988, was {{we want to show}} how a comedian gets his material. The show about nothing was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> in an episode many years later, and Larry and I to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show, because to us it's the opposite of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kobach {{repeatedly}} {{called on}} President Obama to release his birth certificate and defended those who persisted in claiming that Obama {{may have been}} born outside the United States, specifically in Kenya. As Kansas Secretary of State, he requested additional evidence of Obama's birth before he would allow Obama to appear on Kansas ballots for the 2012 presidential election, even {{after the release of}} Obama's long-form birth certificate. In 2009, Kobach [...] "joked at a GOP barbecue that Obama and God had something in common because neither has a birth certificate." [...] Kobach responded to criticism of the joke with [...] "Lighten up. It’s <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke...</b> Are they really suggesting it is forbidden to tell jokes about Barack Obama?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1973 Strummer {{moved to}} Newport, Wales. He did not study at Newport College of Art but {{met up with}} college musicians in the Students' Union in Stow Hill and became vocalist for Flaming Youth, {{renaming}} the band the Vultures. b) The Vultures in time led to The 101ers, a group of West London-based squatters named after their squat address. The 101ers were eventually supported by a nascent Sex Pistols. [...] Mellor adopted the stage name of [...] "Joe Strummer". Impressed {{by the power of}} the Sex Pistols, the newly self-coined Strummer determined that the 101ers were [...] "yesterday's papers" [...] by comparison. It was time to strike out anew. And this led to the start of The Clash. [...] c) [...] "This is my Indian summer...I learnt that fame is an illusion & everything about it is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> I'm far more dangerous now, because I don't care at all." [...] – Joe Strummer to Chris Salewicz – 2000.|$|E
5000|$|McCoy wrote song at {{home while}} smoking hashish. The song was {{originally}} recorded in 1981 as a calypso version titled [...] "Malibu Nightmare". This version was <b>just</b> made as <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> {{but it was}} re-recorded for this album, as a more serious rock song. The song was also released as a single.|$|R
6000|$|... 'How {{could you}} allow such an absurd thing to happen?' he said, in a stern, though {{trembling}} voice. 'You knew I might mistake. I {{had no idea}} {{you were in the}} house: I thought you were miles away, at Sandbourne or somewhere! But I see: it is <b>just</b> done for <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> ha-ha!' ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{tried in}} vain to explain to the police that the entire thing was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> magician's <b>joke.</b> [...] "We will not be deceived in that way," [...] the second cop said. So they hauled him off to the police station. There he was {{recognized}} and set free. The London papers got hold of the story and made it a sensation. The entire town was laughing at the practical joke Herrmann had played on London's finest.|$|R
2500|$|The {{songs for}} Kyōiku were {{inspired}} by {{the image of the}} Sugoroku Tour, and [...] "Sōnan" [...] was the first she wrote of these in 2003. The arpeggio guitar introduction was thought up by Ryosuke Nagaoka (who would later become Tokyo Jihen's second guitarist, Ukigumo), as he recorded the song's demos with Sheena. It was originally <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> however band guitarist Hirama played it in the studio session in the same style as was on the original demo. The song's lyrics were written {{at the same time as}} she composed the music, and were not revised much from their original state. Sheena wrote the song as a love song, but unlike her previous songs about love, she felt that both the man and the woman could be felt in the piece. Sheena did not consider this song as a single when she originally wrote it. The title [...] "Sōnan" [...] does not refer to a disaster, but to distress in a woman's heart.|$|E
2500|$|On June 26, 2003 Spike TV aired {{their own}} adult {{animation}} block called [...] "The Strip" [...] airing Ren & Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon, Stripperella and Gary the Rat. On October 2, 2003 the television program VH1 Goes Inside had {{a documentary about}} Adult Swim. On October 5, 2003 Adult Swim was on from 11:00pm to 5:00am ET. On October 26, 2003 Brak's Dad from The Brak Show hosted Halloween-themed bumps. That same night Adult Swim hosted a live webcam show on their website, featuring the Adult swim staff having a party. The Big O series finale episode [...] "The Show Must Go On", was supposed to premiere that night at 11:00 pm, Adult Swim had to reschedule the episode {{for the next week}} on Sunday, November 2, taking the place for scheduled unaired episode of Family Guy [...] "When you wish upon a Weinstein", upsetting many fans. The Family Guy episode had to air on November 9. When Big O premiered on November 2, a rerun episode, [...] "Stripes" [...] was airing but then Adult Swim said it was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> and they finally aired the correct episode.|$|E
60|$|JOHN [stoutly]. You needn't be {{in such a}} hurry. There {{are three}} days to run yet. [The French are so {{different}} from us that we shall probably {{never be able to}} understand why the COMTESSE laughed aloud here.] It's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> to the Comtesse.|$|E
50|$|Switchboard {{operator}} Marie Lawson (Joan Blondell) is conned by admirer Nicky (Gordon Westcott), {{who tells}} her it is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> practical <b>joke,</b> into redirecting <b>a</b> phone call. However, Nicky uses what he learns {{to his own}} benefit, costing the intended recipient a lot of money. When the victim complains to Marie's boss, telephone repairmen Terry Riley (Pat O'Brien) and John (Allen Jenkins) are called in {{to see if the}} phone was tapped. When it is found not to be, Marie loses her job.|$|R
5000|$|One of the rivalry's {{most memorable}} moments was Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs being {{quoted as saying}} that a [...] "bounty" [...] was put out on the head of Steelers wide {{receiver}} Hines Ward. The bounty controversy was cleared up when Suggs insisted his words were <b>just</b> meant as <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> The NFL investigated, and Suggs was cleared of any wrongdoing.|$|R
500|$|Basically we {{were having}} a laugh at a lot of the {{different}} articles that were appearing at that time in different magazines and papers, and they were talking about 'Pop Kylie, Dance Kylie, Sex Kylie' and, you know, with every different release of a single they'd say 'What Kylie is it now?' and it was <b>just</b> becoming <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> So he, Pedro, cunningly picked up on that and said we should make a video with all the different Kylies, which I was more then [...] happy about, because it was stating the obvious and having a laugh at the same time.|$|R
6000|$|... "He thought he’d {{found a new}} island," [...] {{continued}} the fisherman, [...] "an’ he went ashore an’ hoisted the Union Jack, and named it arter hisself, Piggott’s Bay. Leastways that’s the tale his chaps gave out when they come ’ome. Now when anybody’s a bit out o’ their reckoning we say they’re looking for Piggott’s Bay. It’s <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about here." ...|$|E
60|$|He fell {{right over}} on his back, which wasn't at all dignified, and made Buster Bear laugh. That frightened Mr. Toad more than ever. You see he didn't have the least doubt {{in the world that}} Buster Bear meant to eat him, and when Buster invited him to dinner, he was sure that that was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> on Buster's part.|$|E
60|$|So {{when the}} war broke out his whole {{instinct}} was against it: against war. He had not the faintest desire to overcome any foreigners or to help in their death. He had no conception of Imperial England, and Rule Britannia was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> to him. He was a pure-blooded Englishman, perfect in his race, {{and when he was}} truly himself he could no more have been aggressive on the score of his Englishness than a rose can be aggressive on the score of its rosiness.|$|E
30|$|The third {{issue that}} we found {{interesting}} was related to political decision-making. There were some articles about how power has been shifted away from democratically chosen political decision-makers to professional civil servants. For example, in Image 8 / 2010 the victory of an Icelandic political party that was set-up <b>just</b> as <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> was explained by voters’ frustration towards the toothless political decision-making in the past. In general, there were calls for politicians to resume power and carry their responsibility, not hiding anymore behind civil servants. There were quite a few articles that called for more open, transparent and participatory decision-making processes.|$|R

5000|$|The film depicts Gottfried's {{everyday}} life {{with his wife}} and two children. The film also depicts Gottfried's interactions with his two sisters and his relationship with his parents. The film also discusses The Aristocrats joke told at the Hugh Hefner roast that occurred right after the September 11 attacks. [...] Gottfried had <b>just</b> made <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about <b>a</b> flight to California that had to make a stop at the Empire State Building. [...] The film also discusses the controversy surrounding tweets Gottfried made after the earthquake disaster in Japan that led to his firing as the voice of the Aflac duck.|$|R
