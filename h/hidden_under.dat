Susan became the progenitor of all the Corgis owned by the Royal Household since. The Queen has bred ten generations of dogs from Susan, owning personally more than 30 of the dogs which were either pure-bred Pembroke Welsh Corgis or crossbreed Corgi/Dachshunds called Dorgis.|$|E

5|$|The later evolved commelinids have {{various kinds}} of flower, few of which are 'lily-like'. In the order Poales, {{comprising}} grasses, rushes and sedges, flowers are either petal-less or have small, unshowy petals. Many Zingiberales species have brightly coloured and showy flowers. However, their apparent structure is misleading. For example, the six tepals of cannas are small and <b>hidden</b> <b>under</b> expanded and brightly coloured stamens or staminodes which resemble petals and may be mistaken for them.|$|E
5|$|As {{expected}} by Voltaire, Candide has enjoyed both great success and great scandal. Immediately after its secretive publication, {{the book was}} widely banned because it contained religious blasphemy, political sedition and intellectual hostility <b>hidden</b> <b>under</b> a thin veil of naïveté. However, with its sharp wit and insightful portrayal of the human condition, the novel has since inspired many later authors and artists to mimic and adapt it. Today, Candide is recognized as Voltaire's magnum opus and is often listed {{as part of the}} Western canon; it is among the most frequently taught works of French literature. The British poet and literary critic Martin Seymour-Smith listed Candide as one of the 100 most influential books ever written.|$|E
5|$|Hearing is {{important}} for a nocturnal bird of prey, and as with other owls, the tawny owl's two ear openings differ in structure and are asymmetrically placed to improve directional hearing. A passage through the skull links the eardrums, and small differences {{in the time of}} arrival of a sound at each ear enables its source to be pinpointed. The left ear opening is higher on the head than the larger right ear and tilts downward, improving sensitivity to sounds from below. Both ear openings are <b>hidden</b> <b>under</b> the facial disk feathers, which are structurally specialized to be transparent to sound, and are supported by a movable fold of skin (the pre-aural flap).|$|E

5|$|TNA held a No Disqualification {{match between}} Abyss, who was {{accompanied}} by James Mitchell, and Sabu next. Its duration was 11 minutes and 30 seconds. This was originally promoted as Abyss versus Sabu, however, a No Disqualification stipulation was added during the event. In a No Disqualification match, weapons are legal, as well as outside interference, with a victor determined only by pinfall or submission. In the final minutes, Abyss retrieved a bag of thumbtacks which were <b>hidden</b> <b>under</b> the ring. He then poured the contents onto the ring mat before slamming Sabu back-first into the tacks with his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver.|$|E

The collectibles can be found by having Pikachu speak with other Pokémon and help them with tasks, or by ordering from Shop 'n Squirtle. There is a virtual Pokémon Mini console <b>hidden</b> <b>under</b> the player's bed that plays six games: Snorlax's Lunch Time (exclusive to Pokémon Channel) and five others previously released for the real-life Pokémon Mini. The games are simple and mainly based on rhythm.|$|E

5|$|Roberts' detectives witness Frank Lucas' {{cousin and}} driver shoot {{a woman and}} then use {{the threat of a}} long {{sentence}} to get him to wear a wire. The gathered information allows Roberts and his task force to identify and search one of the last planes carrying Lucas' stock, discovering Blue Magic in the coffins of dead returning servicemen. With this evidence they obtain a warrant to follow the drugs into Newark's projects and Lucas' heroin processing facility. In the ensuing shootout, Steve Lucas, Frank Lucas' young nephew who gave up a promising career for the New York Yankees to join Lucas' crime family, is killed. Meanwhile, Trupo, whose prized Shelby Mustang Lucas had destroyed, and his men break into Lucas' mansion to steal his emergency cash supply <b>hidden</b> <b>under</b> the doghouse, killing the dog. As Lucas gets ready to go after Trupo, his mother dissuades him from killing a cop, warning him that she and Eva will leave him if he does.

5|$|The claw {{of a bird}} of prey; {{its primary}} hunting tool. The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey {{would not be able}} to catch their food. Some birds also use claws for {{defensive}} purposes. Cassowaries use claws on their inner toe (digit II) for defence, and have been known to disembowel people. All birds however have claws, which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits. The hoatzin and turaco are unique among extant birds in having functional claws on the thumb and index finger (digit I and II) on the forelimbs as chicks, allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop. However, several birds have a claw- or nail-like structure <b>hidden</b> <b>under</b> the feathers at the end of the hand digits, notably ostriches, emus, ducks, geese and kiwis.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} the Grays returned, and Ann became {{suspicious}} when Burke would not let her approach a bed where she had left her stockings. When they were left {{alone in the house}} in the early evening, the Grays searched the straw and found Docherty's body, showing blood and saliva on the face. On their way to alert the police, they ran into McDougal who tried to bribe them with an offer of £10 a week; they refused. While the Grays reported the murder to the police, Burke and Hare removed the body and took it to Knox's surgery. The police search located Docherty's bloodstained clothing <b>hidden</b> <b>under</b> the bed. Burke and his wife gave different times for Docherty's departure from the house, which raised enough suspicion for the police to take them in for questioning. Early the following morning the police went to Knox's dissecting-rooms where they found Docherty's body; James Gray identified her as the woman he had seen with Burke and Hare. Hare and his wife were arrested that day, as was Broggan; all denied any knowledge of the events.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating season}} lasts from August to February, and {{coincides with the}} arrival of the rainy season in {{northern}} Australia. The female does the bulk of the nest building, although the male does assist; this is unusual for the genus Malurus. Concealed in grass tussocks or low shrubs, the spherical nest is constructed of dried grasses and usually lined with smaller, finer grasses and hair. Nests examined in southeast Queensland tended to be larger and untidier than those in northern Australia; the former measured 1215cm high by 912cm wide and bore a partly covered 36cm diameter entrance, whereas the latter average around 1013cm in height by 68cm wide with a 24cm entrance. Construction takes around one week, and there may be an interval of up to another seven days before eggs are laid. The eggs produced are white with reddish-brown spots in clutches of three to four, and measure 14.517 x 1013mm; those of subspecies melanocephalus are a little larger than those of cruentatus. The eggs are incubated for two weeks by the female alone. The nestlings are <b>hidden</b> <b>under</b> cover for one week after hatching. The juveniles depend on parents and helpers for approximately one month. They learn to fly between 1112days after hatching. Broods hatched earlier in the season will help to raise the broods hatched later on. They will stay as a clutch group for the season after hatching.|$|E
