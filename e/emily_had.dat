5|$|Tropical Storm Gert struck {{just south}} of where Category 3 Hurricane <b>Emily</b> <b>had</b> struck, and where Tropical Storm Bret hit in late June. As a result, there were {{concerns}} that serious flooding and mudslides would result due to saturated ground. As a precaution, about 1,000people were evacuated from low-lying residences and businesses near the towns of Naranjos Amatlán and Tamiahua in Veracruz, and about 6,000 throughout Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{potential}} for tropical cyclone development, Météo-France declared yellow cyclone alerts for Guadeloupe and Martinique, warning of imminent squally weather. Due {{to the presence of}} Emily, a state of emergency was declared for all of Puerto Rico. Officials ordered the preparation of over 400 storm shelters and ensured adequate water supply. The morning before the storm, government workers were dismissed, and national courtrooms remained closed. The United States Coast Guard issued a statement urging residents of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to avoid recreational boating and swimming until <b>Emily</b> <b>had</b> passed. JetBlue Airways waived fees for flights into the Dominican Republic because of the inclement weather conditions. Four cruise ships, Oasis of the Seas, Freedom of the Seas, Carnival Dream and Carnival Liberty altered their courses through the Caribbean to avoid the storm.|$|E

5|$|By midday on September24, {{the system}} became {{embedded}} within the mid-latitude westerlies and rapidly accelerated towards the northeast. The National Hurricane Center anticipated that Emily would undergo an extratropical transition within 24hours {{at this point}} as they forecast it to merge with the frontal system to the northeast. However, the storm unexpectedly underwent a second phase of rapid intensification on September25, at one point reaching the rate of explosive intensification with the central pressure decreasing at 2.5mbar per hour. By 0600UTC, <b>Emily</b> <b>had</b> re-attained hurricane intensity and at 1145UTC, the center passed directly over Bermuda with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Soon after, the storm reached its secondary peak intensity with winds of 90mph (150km/h) and a minimum pressure of 974mbar (hPa; 28.76inHg).|$|E
5|$|Donald George Bradman was the {{youngest}} son of George and Emily (née Whatman) Bradman, and was born on 27 August 1908 at Cootamundra, New South Wales (NSW). He had a brother, Victor, and three sisters—Islet, Lilian and Elizabeth May. One of his great-grandfathers {{was one of the}} first Italians to migrate to Australia in 1826. Bradman's parents lived in the hamlet of Yeo Yeo, near Stockinbingal. His mother Emily gave birth to him at the Cootamundra home of Granny Scholz, a midwife. That house is now the Bradman Birthplace Museum. <b>Emily</b> <b>had</b> hailed from Mittagong in the NSW Southern Highlands, and in 1911, when Don Bradman was about two-and-a-half years old, his parents decided to relocate to Bowral, close to Mittagong, to be closer to Emily's family and friends, as life at Yeo Yeo was proving difficult.|$|E
5|$|In 1899, Wheeler joined Bradford Grammar School {{shortly before}} his ninth birthday, where he {{proceeded}} straight to the second form. In 1902 Robert and <b>Emily</b> <b>had</b> a second daughter, whom they named Betty; Mortimer showed little interest in this younger sister. In 1905, Robert agreed to take over {{as head of the}} London office of his newspaper, by then renamed the Yorkshire Daily Observer, and so the family relocated to the southeast of the city in December, settling into a house named Carlton Lodge on South Croydon Road, West Dulwich. In 1908 they moved to 14 Rollescourt Avenue in nearby Herne Hill. Rather than being sent for a conventional education, when he was 15 Wheeler was instructed to educate himself by spending time in London, where he frequented The National Gallery and the Victoria and Albert Museum.|$|E

5|$|Ellet and Stephens {{continued}} {{writing to}} Griswold's ex-wife, urging {{her to have}} the divorce repealed. Myers was finally convinced and filed in Philadelphia on September 23, 1853. The court, however, had lost records of the divorce and had to delay the appeal. Adding to Griswold's troubles, that fall, a gas leak in his home caused an explosion and a fire. He was severely burned, losing his eyelashes, eyebrows, and seven of his finger nails. That same year, his 15-year-old daughter, Emily, nearly died in Connecticut. A train she was riding on had fallen off a drawbridge into a river. When Griswold arrived he saw 49corpses in a makeshift morgue. <b>Emily</b> <b>had</b> been pronounced dead when pinned underwater but a doctor was able to revive her. On February 24, 1856, the divorce appeal went to court, with Ellet and Stephens providing lengthy testimony against Griswold's character. Neither Griswold nor Myers attended and the appeal was dismissed. Embarrassed by the ordeal, McCrillis left Griswold in New York and moved in with family in Bangor, Maine.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Twenty-four formed {{southwest}} of Jamaica on October 15 and was upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} on October 17. On October 18, the storm developed a tiny, well-defined eye and began intensifying rapidly, reaching Category5 strength with a record-setting pressure of 882millibars by October 19. The rapid intensification from tropical storm to category 5 hurricane in 24hours was the fastest ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, and the second-fastest worldwide, after Super Typhoon Forrest. Wilma slowly drifted towards the Yucatán Peninsula, weakening slowly to a Category4 before landfall on Cozumel and then the Yucatán coast on October 22. It drifted equally slowly over the peninsula, bringing heavy rain and wind to an area hit hard by Hurricane Emily only 3months before; Hurricane <b>Emily</b> <b>had</b> also passed directly over Cozumel. After leaving the Yucatán as a Category2 storm, the storm moved rapidly to the northeast and strengthened slightly, making landfall on southern Florida on October 24 as a Category3 storm. After crossing Florida, Wilma reintensified to a Category3 storm over the Gulf Stream but sped rapidly out into the Atlantic, and became extratropical shortly after absorbing the remnants of Tropical Storm Alpha (see below).|$|E

25|$|Although {{a letter}} from her {{publisher}} indicates that <b>Emily</b> <b>had</b> begun to write a second novel, the manuscript has never been found. Perhaps Emily {{or a member of}} her family eventually destroyed the manuscript, if it existed, when she was prevented by illness from completing it. It has also been suggested that, though less likely, the letter could have been intended for Anne Brontë, who was already writing The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, her second novel.|$|E
25|$|Born in 1910, Kngwarreye did {{not take}} up {{painting}} seriously until she was nearly 80. She was born and lived in the Anmatyerre language group at Alhalkere in the Utopia community, about 250km north east of Alice Springs. <b>Emily</b> <b>had</b> one brother and one sister, and no children of her own. Her brother's children are Gloria Pitjana Mills and Dolly Pitjana Mills. Her sister-in-law was Minnie Pwerle, mother of Barbara Weir whom Kngwarreye partly raised.

25|$|The family's {{finances}} did not flourish, and Aunt Branwell {{spent the}} money with caution. <b>Emily</b> <b>had</b> a visceral need {{of her home}} and the countryside that surrounded it, and to leave it would cause her to languish and wither. Charlotte and Anne, being more realistic, did not hesitate in finding work and from April 1839 to December 1841 the two sisters had several posts as governesses. Not staying long with each family, their employment would last for some months or a single season. However, Anne did stay with the Robinsons in Thorp Green where things went well, from May 1840 to June 1845.|$|E

25|$|The {{anonymous}} (Currer Bell) {{publication in}} 1847 of Jane Eyre, An Autobiography, established a dazzling reputation for Charlotte. In July 1848, Charlotte and Anne (<b>Emily</b> <b>had</b> {{refused to go}} along with them) travelled by train to London to prove to Smith, Elder & Co. that each sister was indeed an independent author, for Thomas Cautley Newby, the publisher of Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey, had launched a rumour that the three novels were the work of one author, understood to be Ellis Bell (Emily). George Smith was extremely surprised to find two gawky, ill-dressed country girls paralysed with fear, who, to identify themselves, held out the letters addressed to Messrs. Acton, Currer and Ellis Bell. Taken by such surprise, he introduced them to his mother with all the dignity their talent merited, and invited them to the opera for a performance of Rossini's Barber of Seville.|$|E
25|$|Emily {{attended}} the University of Deseret. For a time, {{she was a}} school teacher. In 1883, Grant asked Emily to marry him. Since she had not renounced her dislike for polygamy and he was already married to Lucy, that {{was in many ways}} a very daring move on his part, and she initially declined his request. Emily then {{had a change of heart}} and she and Grant married on May 27, 1884. Since the Edmunds Act had been enacted in 1882, the situation of Mormon polygamists was far worse than it had been a decade earlier when <b>Emily</b> <b>had</b> first renounced polygamy. To avoid Grant having to go to prison on charges of unlawful cohabitation, Emily went to England to live at the LDS mission home to have her first child. She returned to the United States 16 months later and moved between multiple locations in Utah Territory and Idaho to avoid capture.|$|E
25|$|The Priory (or Frescati in this vicinity) Stream is now culverted {{under the}} car park but visible again {{as it passes}} a {{neighbouring}} apartment development and then passes under the main road to emerge again in Blackrock Park. The original tunnel which <b>Emily</b> <b>had</b> built to carry seawater to Frescati remains to this day; its whereabouts secret, {{and it has been}} blocked off. In time of threat from unexpected raids by the Crown Militia from Dublin Castle, the course of the stream could well have formed an escape route. One may notice stray cut-granite blocks which look out of place in the car park. These once belonged to the house. The remnants of Frescati are scattered now and hard to trace. The cast-iron railings were stolen, but a few fragments of plasterwork remain in safe-keeping by the conservationists. Ironically for the conservationists, more of the house would have survived if Roches had been allowed go ahead with the demolition in 1971. The stuccoed ceiling which they originally offered to retain is now destroyed.|$|E

500|$|Early on August31, a {{reconnaissance}} flight {{indicated that}} <b>Emily</b> <b>had</b> become a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale, and further intensification was expected because of warm waters. Later that day, reconnaissance reported that <b>Emily</b> <b>had</b> achieved a peak intensity of , a Category3 major hurricane; the aircraft also observed flight-level winds of [...] At its peak, {{the center of}} the hurricane was located 23mi (37km) east of Hatteras Island while turning northward. Its eye measured 45mi (75km) in diameter, and a portion moved over Hatteras and the Pamlico Sound, constituting a direct hit but not a landfall. After affecting the Outer Banks, Emily continued around the large high-pressure area, turning northeastward into an area with cooler ocean temperatures. The eye nonetheless remained distinct, and Emily maintained much of its intensity through September2. Later that day, the hurricane turned sharply eastward in response to a trough nearby. Wind shear over the region increased, weakening Emily as its eye feature quickly dissipated. Emily turned to the southeast and diminished to a tropical storm on September3, about 500mi (800km) northeast of Bermuda, with a significant deterioration of the convection. Once again becoming nearly stationary, Emily further weakened to a tropical depression late on September4, after only a small area of thunderstorms remained near the center. It accelerated toward the northeast and became extratropical on September6, dissipating shortly thereafter.|$|E
