The club had {{suffered}} a slump in league form after losing the previous season's Division Two play-off final, and were struggling near the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> He signed striker Andy Scott from Sheffield United for a fee of £75,000, as well as signing Glenn Cockerill as player/assistant manager, Warren Aspinall and loanee Nigel Gleghorn. However injuries began to mount, with Ijah Anderson, Derek Bryan and Ricky Reina all sidelined. Adams was named as Second Division Manager of the Month for March after overseeing three wins and two draws. Despite Adams' efforts, Brentford were relegated to Division Three {{on the last day}} of the season, and the club was bought out by Ron Noades, who installed himself as the new Brentford manager.|$|E

Despite being 45 years old at this time, he was still turning out regular appearances for a team whose appearances further up the table seemed indicative {{of a change in}} fortunes, until 1924 saw Derbyshire winless in 24 County Championship games and rooted to the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E

25|$|After a {{play-off}} final appearance {{the previous}} year, Leeds finished bottom amidst yet more financial worries and acrimony. Their placing at the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{was due to}} a 10-point deduction they suffered after going into voluntary administration after their relegation was all but confirmed on the penultimate weekend.

The county {{finished}} bottom of the County Championship {{for the first time}} (it had been jointly at the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> before, but never on its own) and finance became very tight. Snary's bowling was less effective in terms of containment than before – he conceded runs at more than two per over – and he took only 23 wickets, playing in around half the team's games. He left the staff {{at the end of the}} season and did not play any further first-class cricket.|$|E
25|$|Daft {{was born}} at Radcliffe-on-Trent and {{attended}} Trent College, before joining Notts County as an amateur, whilst {{at the same time}} {{being a member of the}} Corinthians club. At this time he also played for Nottingham Forest and Newark, before the advent of league football. On the inauguration of the Football League, he became more settled and in the inaugural season he played in 19 out of the 22 games played by County, scoring eight goals. At the end of the season, County's poor league form resulted in them finishing near the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and having to apply for re-election to the league.|$|E
25|$|On 19 November 1892 County {{defeated}} West Bromwich Albion 8–1 with Daft and Jimmy Oswald both scoring hat-tricks. Despite this, Notts County {{were struggling}} near the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and, after a dispute in January, Daft crossed the River Trent to join Nottingham Forest. Daft only managed four games for Forest {{and in the}} summer he returned to County, who by now had been relegated to Division Two. In 1893–94 County reached third placed in the Second Division table, but failed to gain promotion after losing a test match to Preston North End of Division One.

25|$|The {{next two}} Blues games {{would see the}} team go {{head to head with}} other Premier League teams in trouble at the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Newcastle were first up at St Andrew's, where a James McFadden goal in the first half was {{cancelled}} out by an early goal in the second half by Michael Owen. Then it was a trip to the Madejski Stadium, where Reading were able to capitalise on poor defending from set plays to earn a 2–1 victory, leaving the Blues only a point from 18th placed Bolton. The only highlight of the game was a goal for Mauro Zárate. The last game of the month saw Manchester City visit St Andrew's. Two Zárate goals and a penalty by Gary McSheffrey were enough to overcome the Manchester team, who scored with a penalty of their own from Elano.|$|E
25|$|Seed {{made his}} Wednesday debut on 27 August 1927 {{in the first}} match of the 1927–28 season against Everton. During {{the first part of}} the season Seed was asked to play in {{numerous}} different positions by manager Bob Brown as Wednesday struggled in Division One. By mid March 1928 they had won only six matches out of 32 and were seven points adrift at the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> At that stage Seed was made team captain with existing skipper Fred Keen being dropped, Ellis Rimmer was bought from Tranmere Rovers and these changes triggered an amazing recovery. Wednesday picked up 17 points out of a possible 20 in the last ten matches and avoided relegation by a point. The irony was that it was Seed's old club Tottenham who were relegated on the final day of the season.|$|E
25|$|Curle {{got off to}} {{a flying}} start, winning his first full-match as manager 1–0 against fellow strugglers Tranmere Rovers, This was {{followed}} by a 3–0 victory over Hartlepool United, and another home 3–0 victory against Stevenage. The run of form lifted Carlisle from the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and out of the relegation zone. The surge in form soon petered out however, and United again found themselves near the trapdoor of the Football League's basement division. 7 points from 3 games towards the back end of the season meant that Carlisle secured their Football League safety with 2 games to spare, following a 2–0 home victory over promotion-chasing Plymouth, just 4 days after a courageous 1–1 draw away at Champions Burton Albion. The next season was a much better one but not enough for a promotion push, with the team finishing 10th. A highlight of the season was a visit at Anfield for the third round of the League Cup and a famous 1–1 draw against giants Liverpool, who prevailed 3–2 on penalties.|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{credentials}} as a player, {{there was some}} concern raised that Kubik had no real history as a coach, and he did little to endear himself to fans by bringing in Richard Hancox as coach. Torquay's dire form continued, and the club crashed {{to the bottom of}} the table on Boxing Day; they would ultimately never leave the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> after that. After the worst run of form in the club's history, Kubik eventually quit on 5 February, having won just one of his matches in charge, and Colin Lee was soon after appointed as the new director of football and Keith Curle was appointed as Head Coach on 7 February 2007. Roberts resigned amid growing pressure from supporters and the board of directors, all of whom were unhappy with his conduct as chairman, on 21 February 2007. Local hotel owner Keith Richardson was announced as the new chairman the following day. However, on 7 March 2007, former chairman Mike Bateson was reappointed as chairman, the move coming about due to Chris Roberts' company, Torquay United Holdings, being unable to meet the next payment to purchase the club from Bateson.|$|E
25|$|After {{nearly two}} years out of the game, he {{returned}} to football in June 2005 when he was named youth-development manager of Newcastle United. After Graeme Souness was sacked as Newcastle manager in February 2006, Roeder was appointed caretaker manager, with striker Alan Shearer, then still also a player, as his assistant. He was able to turn the Magpies' season around, rescuing them from near the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to finish seventh in the Premier League with {{a place in the}} Intertoto Cup. Freddy Shepherd, Newcastle United's chairman, consequently named Roeder as first in line to become full-time manager at the club, on condition that Newcastle obtain dispensation from the FA Premier League to allow Roeder to continue without the mandatory UEFA Pro Licence. Newcastle claim exceptional circumstances as Roeder was halfway to gaining the licence when he suffered his brain tumour. The Premier League at first rejected Newcastle's request on 3 May 2006 in accordance with UEFA rules which would not allow Roeder the position. Freddy Shepherd however lobbied the backing of all 19 other premier league club chairmen and they voted in favour of Roeder being allowed to gain the correct licence while in the job. Roeder was named as Newcastle's permanent manager on 16 May, signing a two-year contract with the club.|$|E

On the same day a Yeovil Town XI side faced Sherborne Town in a friendly match and recorded a 3–0 win with Argentine trialist Luciano Álvarez scoring a brace and Dale Williams with the third. On 9 August, defender Scott Guyett joined Conference side Aldershot Town on a one-month loan deal, that evening Yeovil drew 0–0 with Rotherham United in their first home match in League One. Following the match defender Adam Lockwood signed a new one-year contract, On 13 August, Yeovil drew 1–1 with Blackpool with Kevin Amankwaah scoring Yeovil's first goal of the season. Young defender Stephen Reed joined Woking on a short-term loan deal, while Arron Davies scored in a 3–1 victory for Wales under-21s against Malta. On 18 August, record signing Pablo Bastiaini finally received his international clearance, and the following day Yeovil signed a second Argentine, Luciano Álvarez signing a four-month contract after a successful trial. Bastianini's debut though saw Yeovil lost 1–0 away at Barnsley a result which saw Yeovil fall to the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> On 23 August, Yeovil faced Championship side Ipswich Town {{in the first round}} of the League Cup. Yeovil recorded their first victory of the season with Darren Way and Kevin Gall both scoring in a 2–0 win. With the transfer deadline looming, Yeovil rejected a bid in the region of £100,000 from Swansea City for the services of Lee Johson, while defender Michael Rose joined Cheltenham Town on a month's loan deal. but forward Kevin Gall rejected a move to Carlisle United after the two club had agreed an unspecified fee. On 27 August, Yeovil lost 4–2 to Swindon Town, with Bastianini scoring his first goal for the club after just 26 seconds. Three days later Yeovil completed a winless month in the league, losing 3–1 at home to Chesterfield with Álvarez scoring his first Yeovil goal. Transfer deadline day saw Yeovil bring in Liam Fontaine on loan from Fulham, while Luke Oliver returned to Woking on loan, and Dale Williams joined Tiverton Town on loan.|$|E
