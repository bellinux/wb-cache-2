50|$|In 1938, Buick {{introduced}} a five-speed semi-automatic transmission for the Buick Special. This unit was failure prone, however, and eventually {{was replaced by}} the fully automatic <b>Dynaflow</b> <b>transmission</b> for 1948.|$|E
5000|$|The {{transmission}} {{was incapable}} of automatic shifting, requiring the driver to move the shift lever from low to drive to cause an upshift. Buicks equipped with the Dynaflow transmissions were unique among American automobiles {{of the time in}} that the driver or their passengers would not detect the tell-tale interruption in acceleration that resulted when other automatic transmissions of the time shifted through their gears. Acceleration through a Dynaflow was one smooth (if inefficient and slow) experience. It was because of this slow acceleration that the <b>Dynaflow</b> <b>transmission</b> was nicknamed [...] "Dynaslush." ...|$|E
50|$|The early 1950s Cadillacs were {{normally}} {{equipped with}} Hydramatic transmissions. In 1953 the General Motors Hydramatic Plant {{burned to the}} ground, leaving Cadillac without a source of <b>transmissions.</b> Buick <b>Dynaflow</b> <b>transmissions</b> were hastily adapted to Cadillac mount points, and some 19,000 1953 Model 62 Cadillacs, and some 28,000 Cadillacs of all models, were equipped with Dynaflow transmissions.Several thousand 1953 Oldsmobiles were also equipped with Dynaflow.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dynaflow</b> {{automatic}} <b>transmission</b> was now {{optional equipment}} on Supers in 1949. Cars so equipped had 6.9:1 compression ratio and 120 horsepower. Total sales {{set a record}} at 190,514 {{for the first time}} since the Super's introductory year. The instrument panel was new.|$|R
25|$|Engines were {{unchanged}} {{from previous}} years including the standard 250-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8, no-cost regular fuel 235-horsepower 364 or the four-barrel 300-horsepower option of same engine available at extra cost. The two-speed Turbine Drive <b>Dynaflow</b> automatic <b>transmission</b> was standard equipment on LeSabres {{and all other}} full-sized Buicks this year, although a manual transmission was also available.|$|R
5000|$|The {{transmission}} (which {{was actually}} originally {{designed for the}} Citroën) was a [...] "gearless" [...] automatic, using the torque-converter alone to match engine revolutions to the drivetrain revolutions, much like the <b>Dynaflow</b> <b>Transmission</b> introduced later in the USA. The car {{was supposed to have}} a less spartan interior than the other Traction Avants and it was to feature Citroën's own new V8 engine. About twenty prototypes were made, but the project was canceled at the start of 1935 after the company's bankruptcy and resulting Michelin takeover, which rapidly led to a level of financial discipline that the company had hitherto heroically failed to apply. The prototype 22CVs were probably all destroyed.|$|E
50|$|A massive {{fire that}} {{destroyed}} GM's Hydra-Matic plant in Livonia, Michigan on August 12, 1953 left the corporation {{and the three}} divisions that used this transmission scrambling for other sources of automatic transmissions to complete that year's model year production. As a result, Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs during the downtime were assembled with Buick's <b>Dynaflow</b> <b>transmission,</b> while Pontiacs used Chevrolet's Powerglide, both two-speed torque-converter units. Non-GM makes that bought Hydra-Matics from the corporation, including Ford Motor Co.'s Lincoln division and independent automakers Hudson, Kaiser and Nash, ended up looking for other sources of automatic transmissions as well, with Lincoln using the Borg Warner designed Ford-O-Matic transmission, while other automakers also switched to automatics from Borg-Warner during the downtime.|$|E
5000|$|A Borg-Warner 3-speed {{automatic}} {{was tested}} and was installed on car #1048, but Tucker ultimately wanted to design his own transmission for the car.To solve the transmission {{problems with a}} new design, Warren Rice, creator of the Buick <b>Dynaflow</b> <b>transmission,</b> was consulted. A unique continuously variable transmission called the [...] "Tuckermatic" [...] was designed, which {{was strong enough to}} handle the Franklin O-335's power and torque. It was a simple but effective design with double torque converters and only 27 parts, about 90 fewer than normally required for an automatic. The double torque converters allowed a continuously variable drive ratio with only one forward gear and one reverse gear which used the torque converters to vary the transmission ratio based on load and engine speed.|$|E
2500|$|While Invicta and Electra/225 {{models were}} powered by Buick's new 401-cubic-inch V8, LeSabre {{continued}} with the 364-cubic-inch V8 previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958. In standard form, the engine delivered 250 horsepower with a two-barrel carburetor and 10.25 to 1 compression ratio (with <b>Dynaflow</b> transmission; manual <b>transmission</b> cars {{had a lower}} 8.5 to 1 compression ratio but horsepower was still rated at 250). Optionally available was a four-barrel version of the 364 rated at 300 horsepower. A three-speed manual transmission was standard on LeSabre but most cars were built with the optional two-speed <b>Dynaflow</b> automatic <b>transmission</b> that was standard equipment on the Invicta and Electra/225. A three-speed [...] "Triple Turbine" [...] Dynaflow variant was also available. Power steering and power brakes were optional and all 1959 Buicks used the unique 12-inch finned aluminum brake drums for improved stopping power that were originally introduced on the 1957 Roadmaster.|$|R
50|$|Modifications to {{the basic}} three element design have been {{periodically}} incorporated, especially in applications where higher than normal torque multiplication is required. Most commonly, these have taken the form of multiple turbines and stators, each set being designed to produce differing amounts of torque multiplication. For example, the Buick <b>Dynaflow</b> automatic <b>transmission</b> was a non-shifting design and, under normal conditions, relied solely upon the converter to multiply torque. The Dynaflow used a five element converter to produce {{the wide range of}} torque multiplication needed to propel a heavy vehicle.|$|R
25|$|For 1953, {{the base}} 88 was renamed the DeLuxe 88 for only this one year while the Super 88 {{continued}} {{as a more}} upscale version. Engines and transmission offerings {{were the same as}} 1952. Late in the 1953 model year, a fire destroyed GM's Hydra-Matic plant in Livonia, Michigan, which was then the only source for Hydra-Matic transmissions. The temporary loss of Hydra-Matic production led Oldsmobile to build thousands of its 1953 models with Buick's two-speed <b>Dynaflow</b> automatic <b>transmissions</b> until GM pressed its Willow Run Transmission plant into service to resume Hydra-Matic production. New options this year included Frigidaire air conditioning, power steering, and power brakes.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s the Buick {{division}} of GM collaborated with Darby Buick of Sarasota, Florida to investigate potential marine {{uses of the}} <b>Dynaflow</b> <b>transmission.</b> The test boat was a 21-foot Correct Craft. The engine was a 364 CID Buick with a four barrel Rochester carburetor of nominal 300 gross HP. While the boat could attain speeds of about 60 MPH, which was considerable at the time, the transmission suffered from several problems. First, the torque in reverse was excessive, although {{this could have been}} alleviated with different gear ratios. Second, the role of [...] "Park" [...] in a car necessitated a stopped drivetrain. Without the locked-in-place tires of a car, it was difficult to put the transmission into the equivalent of [...] "Park." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1962 the Wildcat was a Buick Invicta subseries, mating the Invicta's longer {{full-size}} two-door hardtop Buick body (known as the [...] "sport coupe", body production code 4647) with {{a high-performance}} [...] {{version of the}} 401 cid L Nailhead V8, known as the [...] "Wildcat 445" [...] for producing [...] of torque. To further distance itself from the Invicta, the Wildcat had Electra 225-like taillights, a bucket seat interior, and a center console with tachometer and transmission shifter. It had a <b>Dynaflow</b> <b>transmission</b> shared by all full-sized Buicks, plus special exterior side trim, vinyl-covered roof (new for 1962), and its own unique emblem: a stylized head of a wild cat, located {{on each of the}} C-pillars. However, the Wildcat did share the LeSabre's and Invicta's trio of VentiPorts on the front fenders, a design cue lasting only through the 1963 model year.|$|E
5000|$|The THM400 can be {{visually}} {{identified by}} an oil pan number four shown at General Motors Transmission Pans. First introduced for the 1964 model year {{under the name}} [...] "Turbo Hydra-Matic" [...] in Cadillacs and [...] "Super Turbine" [...] in Buicks. The following year, application expanded to Oldsmobile and Pontiac and to some full-sized Chevrolets. Many of the Buick, Cadillac, and Oldsmobile THM400s produced between 1964-67 were equipped with a [...] "Switch-Pitch" [...] torque converter with a variable-pitch stator, which is sought after by collectors and drag racers. These can be identified outside the vehicle (with the torque converter removed) by a narrow front pump spline. Externally the switch pitch version has two electrical connections, where the non-switch pitch THM400 has only one. GM used a Switch Pitch torque converter in the Buick twin turbine <b>Dynaflow</b> <b>transmission</b> between 1955-1963 and the Super Turbine 300 two speed transmissions used by Oldsmobile Pontiac, and Buick divisions between 1964-1967. This transmission (among other THMs) is identified by the [...] "Park R N D L2 L1" [...] selector quadrant.|$|E
5000|$|The 1950 Super {{came with}} a single two-barrel {{carburetor}} on a new higher displacement 263 cuin L Fireball I8 which produced [...] It was able to achieve speeds over 90 mph with an optional <b>Dynaflow</b> automatic <b>transmission</b> which, rather than changing through gears, used the torque converter to couple the motor to a single gear ratio. The car had 2 splits in the back glass although the windshield was now curved one-piece glass. Models also could be equipped with an AM radio and an antenna that could be adjusted via a knob in the front center above the windshield. In the June 1953 Popular Mechanics, acceleration was rated at 0-60 mph in 14.5 seconds. The Super set an all time record of 251,883 sold.|$|R
5000|$|LeSabre and {{all other}} 1959 Buicks not only got new names, but all-new styling as well, {{adopting}} the new GM B- and C-body used {{on all of the}} corporation's full-sized cars (the larger C-body used in the Electra as well as the Oldsmobile 98 and all Cadillacs was basically a stretched out B-body rather than a distinct body and chassis for 1959-60). Wheelbases increased by one inch on all models. The new styling included slanted headlights in front along with a chromey square grille somewhat similar to the 1958 Buick and [...] "Delta-wing" [...] fins back along with round taillights. The appearance was shared with two other Buick models, the mid-level Invicta and the top model Electra.While Invicta and Electra/225 models were powered by Buick's new 401-cubic-inch V8, LeSabre continued with the 364-cubic-inch V8 previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958. In standard form, the engine delivered 250 horsepower with a two-barrel carburetor and 10.25 to 1 compression ratio (with <b>Dynaflow</b> transmission; manual <b>transmission</b> cars had a lower 8.5 to 1 compression ratio but horsepower was still rated at 250). Optionally available was a four-barrel version of the 364 rated at 300 horsepower. A three-speed manual transmission was standard on LeSabre but most cars were built with the optional two-speed <b>Dynaflow</b> automatic <b>transmission</b> that was standard equipment on the Invicta and Electra/225. A three-speed [...] "Triple Turbine" [...] Dynaflow variant was also available. Power steering and power brakes were optional and all 1959 Buicks used the unique 12-inch finned aluminum brake drums for improved stopping power that were originally introduced on the 1957 Roadmaster.|$|R
5000|$|The {{project was}} a {{follow-up}} to Earl's famous 1938 Y-job. Like all his projects, it was built to be roadworthy, and became Earl's personal automobile for two years after finishing its tour of the auto show circuit. With a body made of aluminium, magnesium, and fiberglass, it was powered by a supercharged 215 cuin L V8 able to run on gasoline (petrol) or methanol (like Indy roadsters of the period did), and had an unusually-placed rear-mounted Buick <b>Dynaflow</b> automatic <b>transmission.</b> This was later changed to a GM Hydramatic. In addition to its jet inspired design, the 1951 Le Sabre also featured numerous advanced features, including a 12-volt electrical system (most cars of the period were 6-volt), heated seats, electric headlights concealed behind the center oval [...] "jet intake", front bumper dagmars (later made famous on 1957-9 Cadillacs), a water sensor to activate the power top, and electric lifting jacks integral to the chassis to aid tire changes. (This idea would be copied decades later by Formula One race teams.) ...|$|R
50|$|Chevrolet Turboglide {{was modeled}} {{along the lines}} of the Buick Flight Pitch <b>Dynaflow</b> <b>transmission,</b> and {{operated}} very similarly to the Buick transmission. Using a five element torque converter, (pump, individual turbines for low, intermediate and direct ranges, and a switch pitch stator) the Turboglide offered the smoothest operation of any automatic in the industry, as no shift occurred between ranges and hence there was no potential to create a disruption in the perfectly smooth flow of power. For extra getaway power at any road speed, the converter stator vanes could be directed to a steeper angle which raised the stall speed of the torque converter and increased torque multiplication, as well as directing the oil flow at the turbine for the next lowest range. Turboglides selector quadrant was Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, Hill Retarder (early 1957 only) P R N D Hr or Grade Retarder (late 1957-1961) P R N D Gr. Some owners of the early 1957 models with the Turboglide transmission marked with HR Retarder mistook the HR to mean High Range so the marking was changed early in the model year to Gr Retarder.|$|E
5000|$|... 1957 {{was also}} Chevrolet's first {{offering}} of a turbine transmission, {{known as the}} Turboglide. It was a design concept that Buick had developed with their <b>Dynaflow</b> <b>transmission.</b> However, due to a reliability reputation caused by its complexity, most automatic transmission buyers shunned the Turboglide {{in favor of the}} two-speed Powerglide that had been offered since 1950. At the time the Turboglide casing was the largest cast aluminum component ever put into mass production, but it never recovered from the reputation in 1957 and the option was discontinued in 1961. Manual transmissions were limited to three-speed, column shifted units (with synchromesh in second and third gear only). The Powerglide's shifter went P N D L R while the Turboglide's was P R N D Hr (although the 'Hr' was changed early in the production series to 'Gr'-Grade Retarder because of drivers' mistaken belief that 'Hr' meant High Range instead of the correct Hill Retarder.) [...] [...] An overdrive unit was available as an option on the three speed manually shifted transmission cars. Starting at the end of May 1957, a four speed manual transmission was also offered at an over-the-counter price of $188.00 but no installation kit (shifter and linkage) was ever offered by Chevrolet and, while an owner may have jury-rigged an installation in their own car, {{there is no evidence that}} any dealer ever actually installed the transmission in any car in 1957. A '57 equipped with this transmission mated to the 270 horsepower engine and limited slip differential was the one to beat on the drag strip and street into the early 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|During the Dynaflow era, many of Buick’s unique {{engineering}} features ranked smoothness above {{most other}} design and marketing objectives. Dynaflow's non-shifting design was demonstrably smoother than the rough shifting automatics then available. Moreover, Buick’s torque tube [...] "live axle" [...] rear suspension design, which incorporated a rigid drive shaft {{with just one}} single universal joint ("U-joint") at {{the front end of}} the driveshaft, was said to amplify the harshness of contemporary automatic shifting <b>transmissions.</b> <b>Dynaflow’s</b> non-shifting design addressed this characteristic of Buick’s driveline. Torque tube rear suspension was a simple design that enabled Buick to use soft coil springs while its competitors and corporate cousins used harsher, firmer leaf spring, Hotchkiss drive rear suspension.|$|R
2500|$|For 1959, the Electra and Electra 225 both {{used the}} General Motors C-body {{shared with the}} Oldsmobile 98 and all Cadillac, riding on a longer [...] {{wheelbase}} than the B-body LeSabre and Invicta, both of which rode on [...] The standard and only available engine was the 401 cubic-inch Wildcat V8 with four-barrel carburetor, 10.25 to 1 compression ratio and [...] mated to a two-speed <b>Dynaflow</b> automatic <b>transmission,</b> which was also standard equipment along with power steering and power brakes using Buick's unique [...] finned aluminum brake drums. Power windows and seat and leather interiors were standard on the Electra 225 convertible and optional on all other models. Front bucket seats were optional on the convertible. Electra interiors were trimmed in nylon Mojave cloth or broadcloth combinations with Cordaveen. Electra 225 convertibles were trimmed in leather. Standard Electra features included horizontal Red-line speedometer, two-speed electric windshield wipers, trip mileage indicator, cigar lighter, dual sunshades, Step-On parking brake, dual horns, Twin-Turbine automatic transmission, Foamtex seat cushions, electric clock, trunk light, glovebox light, power steering, power brakes, full wheelcovers and dual exhaust. In addition Electra 225s had Super Deluxe wheelcovers and an outside rearview mirror as standard equipment. Padded dashboards were also standard.|$|R
