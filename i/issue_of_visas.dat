A labour recruiter can be either public or private and offers labour recruitment services. These businesses profit from the recruitment of migrants workers from one country and their allocation in jobs in another. Agents charge fees and commission for their services to migrant domestic workers. Sri Lankan migrant domestic worker pay an estimated $1300–1600 to a Lebanese agent while potential workers in the Philippines and Ethiopia pay between $2,400-3500 and $1,700-2100 respectively. [...] The Lebanese agent will also earn anything between $300 and 600 in commission in addition. This money covers travel costs, Lebanese government visa fees, and the agency fee. In some cases, the first three months' salary is signed away as payment. The agency fees {{cover the cost of}} airfare, government charges for <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>visas</b> and agency commissions. The residency, work permit, notary fee and annual insurance are not included in the initial sum and are the responsibility of the employer sum which is calculated to US$500. There is a difference in the amount the agency receives for each group of workers depending on their country of origin. One example is the migrant workers from the Philippines who demand higher costs and monthly salaries because they have a good command of English, both spoken and written. They are deemed better educated and therefore are given a higher respect as maids than those from other countries. Some employment agencies contract migrant domestic worker out on short-term contracts at a cost of up to $450 per month. The high prices involved in recruiting a migrant domestic worker means that employers take precautions to make sure the worker does not leave their position before their contract is up. The migrant domestic worker is also required to make a deposit of $1,000 in a Lebanese back in order to cover return ticket home, which is never available to the worker. Because of the conditions present in Lebanon, legal and illegal agencies flourish and due to the Kafala system a migrant has to rely on agencies to find a Lebanese sponsor and employer.|$|E

At the root of this row is an “EU sanction”: a visa ban prohibiting the entry into EU territory to Zimbabwean high-rank ofﬁcials. Zimbabwe has been under EU sanctions since the crisis of 2002. The visa ban and the arms embargo imposed then were supplemented shortly after by an assets freeze; however, no restrictions on trade between the EU and Zimbabwe have been imposed.

Specifically, local border traffic is viewed as the most effective form of interaction in the field <b>of</b> <b>visa</b> regime simplification and border territory development. An assessment of the positions of key negotiators shows that local border traffic between the Kaliningrad region of Russia and the Polish border voivodeships is a success, which stresses the need for a prompt transition to a visa-free regime with the EU. ...|$|R
