5000|$|Net Jet is a Windows PC-based game system {{introduced}} by Hasbro (under the Tiger Electronics brand) in 2007. The game {{system is a}} controller that is somewhat similar in design to a PlayStation 2 gamepad. The Net <b>Jet</b> controller is <b>plugged</b> into the USB port in a computer, and automatically started up and downloaded games via a required Internet connection. A dozen featured games could be played on a trial basis, or unlocked via plug in [...] "game keys" [...] (which are essentially jumper blocks). The Net Jet came in seven different color variations. Net Jet support officially ended December 31, 2009.|$|R

50|$|The Net <b>Jet</b> makes itself <b>plug</b> n play by {{containing}} a small bit of firmware in the controller. When plugged in, a virtual CD-ROM image (400K in size) would automatically mount, then proceed to download and install its software via the Internet so {{to display a}} menu selection screen. Any games selected would then {{also need to be}} downloaded and stored on the computer. The Net Jet is a proprietary controller, it can only be used for its own games and not as a standard PC gamepad controller (it was detected as a USB hub, as opposed to a game controller by the computer). The controller itself had 7 buttons (two shoulder, four front and one 'start'), d-pad and analog thumb stick.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experimental}} supersonic retropropulsion {{tests were}} conducted at the NASA Langley Research Center Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel Test Section 2 {{for a range of}} Mach numbers from 2. 4 to 4. 6. A 5 -inch 70 -degree sphere-cone forebody model with a 10 -inch cylindrical aftbody experimental model was used which is capable of multiple retrorocket configurations. These configurations include a single central nozzle on the center point of the forebody, three nozzles at the forebody half-radius, and a combination of the first two configurations with no <b>jets</b> being <b>plugged.</b> A series of measurements were achieved through various instrumentation including forebody and aftbody pressure, internal pressures and temperatures, and high speed Schlieren visualization. Specifically, several high speed pressure transducers on the forebody and in the plenum were implemented to look at unsteady flow effects. The following work focuses on analyzing frequency traits due to the unsteady flow for a range of thrust coefficients for single, tri, and quad-nozzle test cases at freestream Mach 4. 6 and angle of attack ranging from - 8 degrees to + 20 degrees. This analysis uses Matlab s fast Fourier transform, Welch's method (modified average of a periodogram), to create a power spectral density and analyze any high speed pressure transducer frequency traits due to the unsteady flow...|$|R

I don’t focus that much on what Isis does. Also this may sound strange, but this is genuinely the first time someone’s told me they (ISIS) threatened to attack the UK, which is probably a bit embarrassing, seeing as I’m in Syria and you’d expect I’d hear these things. If Britain stopped bombing Muslims in Syria the Muslims in Syria would stop attacking them. Is that hard to understand?" [...] When questioned about the treatment of Muslims in Syria he said: [...] "The Muslims in Syria are burned alive, raped, abused, imprisoned and much more. I also think that some of the Muslims I met here are living like walking mountains. Full of honour." [...] When asked about the US-led coalition and Isis he said: [...] "I’ve seen Muslims burned alive {{as a result of what}} the US calls 'hellfire missiles'. I’ve seen the little girls that lived around the corner from me at my old house hide from American <b>jets</b> and <b>plugging</b> their ears from the sound. Isis has (made) huge mistakes, I don’t deny that, but the coalition has (made) far worse mistakes.

40|$|A {{plug nozzle}} {{has been studied}} as a {{promising}} nozzle from a viewpoint of improving thrust efficiency for rocket or space plane. In the field of mechanical engineering, supersonic jets from a Laval or a conical nozzle are frequentlry used as a cleaning tool, cooling tool, mixing tool, etc. The plug nozzle also has possibility applicable {{to the field of}} mechanical engineering as well, however, the jet structure of the plug nozzle is now well known. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to clarify the structure of <b>jets</b> from a <b>plug</b> nozzle by solving Euler equations numerically. The jet flowfield is computed for an axisymmetric plug with a design Mach number 2. 0, and the velocity distributions on jet center line are obtained for the over, correct and underexpanded supersonic jets.

40|$|The {{aeroacoustics}} of a porous <b>plug</b> <b>jet</b> {{noise suppressor}} was investigated. The predicted flow features of isentropic plug nozzles for different pressure ratios or exit flow Mach numbers, throat areas, ratios of the plug to annular nozzle radii, mass flow {{rates and the}} available run times possible with the existing compressed air supply system, are compiled. The dimensions and the coordinates of the contour of typical isentropic external expansion plugs with different exit flow Mach numbers are listed. Design details of the experimental facility and the plug nozzle selected for experimental aeroacoustic studies are reported. The analytical flow prediction by method of characteristics of a conical porous plug nozzles is initiated. The role of the shape, size, and porosity of the plug surface in achieving over a perforated conical plug a nearly isentropic shockfree supersonic flow field which is closely similar to the flow field of a contoured isentropic plug nozzle is examined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a new approach to visualize gas jet from an automotive fuel injector. This method of visualizing gas jet in water can be used to investigate the gas jet structure, development and interaction with the environment where injection takes place. The fuel injector used is called Spark Plug Fuel Injector (SPFI). SPFI is a low cost conversion device for conversion to compressed natural gas direct injection (CNGDI) in spark ignition engine. The experiment was carried out to measure the gas jet of SPFI by using pure gaseous nitrogen as compressed natural gas substitute for safety proposes. Nitrogen was injected at 40, 50 and 60 bar with different length of SPFI’s fuel path. The images of the gas bubbles which formed at the nozzle of the SPFI for different time after the start of injection (SOI) from a direct fuel injector were captured using a digital camera where exposure times were adjusted accordingly. The fuel injection was synchronized with a flash light using MOSFET-controlled circuit and two pulse generators. Two sets of SPFI with different fuel path length were used. Results showed that the SPFI with shorter fuel path achieved shorter fuel delivery time and less pressure loss. The gas jets of the longer SPFI were 11. 70 % and 2. 5 % shorter and narrower than that of gas jet of shorter SPFI. The results also showed that higher injection pressure increased both gas jet length and width of SPFI and the shape of the gas jet were in agreement with the vortex ball model [1] but with different degree of penetration compared to gas jet in air environment. This investigation of gas jet structure must be further elaborated with different water pressure in order to reach governing equations and ultimately correlated to the vortex ball model for a possible low cost gaseous flow visualization technique.

40|$|Jet {{grouting}} {{is adopted}} in different geotechnical conditions to ensure provisional earth retaining and waterproofing functions {{at the bottom}} and walls of excavations. Despite careful theoretical models avail-able to predict the mechanical response of these structures, design is often carried out without adequate con-trol, i. e. by assuming ideal effectiveness of ground improvement. On the contrary, adverse effects have been documented by past experiences which {{can be traced back to}} erroneous prediction of treatments effects, inac-curate control of the execution or to unexpected responses of the surrounding environment. All these uncertainties, which become particularly critical when excavation is performed in urbanized areas, can be mini-mized by detailed preliminary field trials, accurate controls of the execution of treatments and a prompt monitoring of the surrounding area. The present paper describes this methodology applied to the design and the execution of a massive <b>jet</b> grouting bottom <b>plug</b> forming the base of a large excavation in city environment. The results of preliminary field trials are summarized to directly compare the effectiveness of different injection systems and introduced in statistical design analyses of the jet grouted structure. A detailed investigation of the movements induced at ground level by injections is also reported. To this aim, the evolution of displacements recorded around trial columns and on the area surrounding the excavation is mapped to evaluate the effects of the different adopted injection techniques.
