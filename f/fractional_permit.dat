40|$|Proceedings of the 1997 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 20 - 22, 1997, Athens, Georgia. In humid {{regions of}} the eastern United States, rainfalls and streamflows have usually been {{sufficient}} to supply nearly all human needs. In those states a set of common-law precedents known as the riparian doctrine has evolved. This doctrine is rather imprecise compared to the appropriative doctrine of the western states. In recent years, problems of concentrated use have become more common and severe in humid regions, leading to calls for water regulations. There {{are a number of}} options for such regulations; this paper provides a comparison of alternatives in the context of six program objectives and a number of agency decisions. The first program objective is the ease of setting up the program initially (implementation), operating it routinely (administration), and insuring compliance with it (enforcement). The second is maintaining equity, or the perception thereof, among water users. The third is to maintain minimum streamflows. The fourth is robustness, or insensitivity to errors in the data. The fifth is economic efficiency. The final objective is political and legal feasibility. The first agency decision is what the permit should entitle its holder to do and under what circumstances. An operational definition of a permit must say where, and for how long, the water may be withdrawn and what happens when there is not enough water to supply all users. Options for permit structure are: 1) no regulations, 2) prioritized ministry permits like those used in the West, and 3) <b>fractional</b> <b>permits,</b> in which users' allowable withdrawals increase and decrease with streamflow. Only the latter, <b>fractional</b> <b>permits,</b> are seen as appropriate for traditionally riparian regions. Another agency decision is on what basis permits should be distributed initially. Size allocations could be roughly proportional to some measure of past use rate or current size of operation (e. g., hectares irrigated or population served) with provisions to dissuade profligate use just to receive a higher allocation. Another decision is whether or not permits should be transferable and, if so, under what circumstances or restrictions, etc. The most frequently-cited argument in favor of allowing users to transfer permits is economic efficiency. The chief drawbacks of transfers are that local streamflow rainfalls and streamflows have usually been sufficient to standards could be violated and third parties could be impaired. Other agency decisions include the duration of permits and their averaging periods. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

In {{order to obtain}} an efficient method, to provide good approximations with independence {{of the size of}} the diffusion parameter, we have developed a numerical method which combines a finite difference spatial discretization on a special mesh and a fractional step method for the time variable. The special mesh allows a correct approximation of the solution in the boundary layers, while the <b>fractional</b> steps <b>permits</b> a low computational cost algorithm.

40|$|Deformation {{patterns}} in solids are often characterized by self-similarity at the meso-level. In this paper, {{the framework for}} the mechanics of heterogeneous solids, deformable over fractal subsets, is briefly outlined. Mechanical quantities with non-integer physical dimensions are considered, i. e., the fractal stress [σ *] and the fractal strain [ε *]. By means of the local fractional calculus, the static and kinematic equations are obtained. The extension of the Gauss-Green Theorem to <b>fractional</b> operators <b>permits</b> to demonstrate the Principle of Virtual Work for fractal media. From {{the definition of the}} fractal elastic potential φ *, the fractal linear elastic relation is derived. Beyond the elastic limit, peculiar mechanisms of energy dissipation come into play, providing the softening behaviour characterized by the fractal fracture energy...|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} to provide a complete characterization of normal multivariate stochastic vector processes is presented in this paper. Such proposed method {{is based on the}} evaluation of the complex spectral moments of the processes. These quantities are strictly related to the Mellin transform and they are the generalization of the integer-order spectral moments introduced by Vanmarcke. The knowledge of the complex spectral moments permits to obtain the power spectral densities and their cross counterpart by a complex series expansions. Moreover, with just the aid of some mathematical properties the complex <b>fractional</b> moments <b>permit</b> to obtain also the correlation and cross-correlation functions, providing a complete characterization of the multivariate stochastic vector processes. Some numerical applications are reported in order to show the capabilities of this method. In particular, the examples regard two dimensional linear oscillators forced by Gaussian white noise, the characterization of the wind velocity field, and the stochastic response analysis of vibro-impact system under Gaussian white noise...|$|R

Management would establish a target number of licenses and determine separately how many fishers qualified for participation. Management would then issue some fraction of a license to each qualifier, such that {{the product of the}} fraction times the number of qualifiers equals the target number of licenses. To fish, a fisher would have to acquire fractions totalling 100 percent. The <b>fractional</b> license approach <b>permits</b> a clearer separation of the decisions on the total level of fishing effort and the decisions on who receives fishing rights. ...|$|R

DE 1 measurements of ion composition and temperatures at 1. 4 - 3. 5 R(F) in the plasmasphere were combined with DE- 2 measurements of ion composition and electron and ion temperatures in the upper F region/topside ionosphere, closely spaced in universal and local time for cases in the November 6 - 11, 1981 period. The observations are compared directly with the field-line interhemispheric plasma (FLIP) model calculations of altitudinal ion density and temperature profiles.

40|$|With EV and HEV developments, battery {{monitoring}} systems {{have to meet}} the new requirements of car industry. This paper deals with one of them, the battery ability to start a vehicle, also called battery crankability. A fractional order model obtained by system identification is used to estimate the crankability of lead-acid batteries. <b>Fractional</b> order modelling <b>permits</b> an accurate simulation of the battery electrical behaviour with a low number of parameters. It is demonstrated that battery available power is correlated to the battery crankability and its resistance. Moreover, the high-frequency gain of the fractional model {{can be used to}} evaluate the battery resistance. Then, a battery crankability estimator using the battery resistance is proposed. Finally, this technique is validated with various battery experimental data measured on test rigs and vehicles. © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} Wiener filter, {{which can}} be implemented in O(N log N) time, is suited best for space-invariant degradation models and space-invariant signal and noise characteristics. For space-varying degradations and nonstationary processes, however, the optimal linear estimate requires O(N 2) time for implementation. Optimal filtering in <b>fractional</b> Fourier domains <b>permits</b> reduction of the error compared with ordinary Fourier domain Wiener filtering for certain types of degradation and noise while requiring only O(N log N) implementation time. The amount of reduction in error depends on the signal and noise statistics {{as well as on}} the degradation model. The largest improvements are typically obtained for chirplike degradations and noise, but other types of degradation and noise may also benefit substantially from the method (e. g., nonconstant velocity motion blur and degradation by inhomegeneous atmospheric turbulence). In any event, these reductions are achieved at no additional cost. © 1998 Optical Society of America...|$|R
40|$|We study {{discrete}} fluxes in brane {{constructions of}} QCD-like theories. It is shown that when these theories are compactified on a torus, a periodic potential is generated for the Neveu-Schwarz two-form modulus B. The minima of this potential are given by B = 2 π m N, where m is the ’t Hooft flux and N is {{the rank of}} the gauge group. The underlying reason for this potential is {{the existence of a}} mass gap. In this case one is not allowed a continuous range for B corresponding to non-commutative deformations of the torus. We show that B behaves like the two form modulus of the QCD string, as well as the IIA string. This equivalence has been conjectured previously based on properties of large N QCD suggesting a T-duality invariance. Finally we show that the relation B = 2 π m N <b>permits</b> <b>fractional</b> D 0 -brane charge without violating Dirac quantization in the presence of...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, the {{efficiency}} of fractional models for thermal systems modeling is demonstrated through an application to transistor junction temperature estimation. Two fractional models are indeed used to represent the dynamic evolution of the junction temperature and of the dissipator temperature on which the transistor is mounted. These two models are then used to estimate a transistor junction temperature. Such a temperature diagnostic is really important on power electronic devices to optimize the heat management of IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor). This estimator provides information about junction temperature using a dynamic output feedback-based observer, with only {{a measure of the}} dissipator temperature. This limited number of required measures and the simple heat transfer <b>fractional</b> models obtained <b>permit</b> a simple and online implementation of the estimator. The estimator has been implemented and produces very accurate junction temperature estimation. Such an estimator should thus be used to monitor electronic systems such as motor controller, welding, DC/DC and AC/DC converters and to prevent damages in electronic systems on which the considered transistors (or similar components) are used.|$|R

40|$|A {{relatively}} new but generalized concept of fractional cointegration {{is applied to}} {{shed some light on}} the validity of purchasing power parity (PPP) as a long-run equilibrium condition, by examining the long-run relationship between quarterly consumer price indices and bilateral exchange rates of the Australian dollar and seven major OECD trading partners, over Australia's recent float. The paper demonstrates that relaxing the condition that the residual from the cointegration equation must be a I(0) process, provides a wide range of cases of parity-reversion with processes that are CI(1,d) with 0 < d < 1. Findings tend to suggest that, while standard tests of cointegration fail to support cointegration between nominal exchange rates, domestic and foreign prices, and thus the empirical favour for PPP as a long-run phenomenon, the <b>fractional</b> cointegration analysis <b>permits</b> deviations from equilibrium to follow a fractionally integrated process and hence captures a much wider class of parity or mean-reversion behaviour. Results are mainly supportive of long-run PPP. Furthermore, an analysis of the short-run dynamics propelling the long-run relationship (through a VECM) reveals that domestic prices are consistently the initial receptor of an exogenous shock to the equilibrium and the long-run equilibrium is restored through the short-run adjustment of the nominal exchange rates. These findings are shown to hold clear policy implications. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Traditionally, {{indexing}} {{and searching}} of speech content in multimedia databases {{have been achieved}} {{through a combination of}} separately constructed speech recognition and information retrieval engines. Although each technology has a legacy of research, only recently have efforts been made to study the potential suboptimality of this strategy, and none of these efforts specifically addresses the presence of uncertainty in automatically generated transcriptions. This research develops a refinement of the most common information retrieval relevance formula, TFIDF, to incorporate uncertainty as a retrieval feature, along with a set of techniques to acquire this uncertainty from multiple hypotheses produced by existing speech recognition data structures. In the process a greater amount of evidence is extracted than is available in the most likely transcription hypothesis, and overall retrieval precision and recall are improved. The term weighting scheme known as the inverse document frequency is shown to be a special case of the mutual information between the document set and the term, the former requiring a Boolean characterization of term occurrence information and the latter <b>permitting</b> <b>fractional</b> probabilities. The relevance between a query and document from speech recognition is then modelled as a random variable arising from the statistical nature of the speech recognition system. The statistics of this model are then derived from the word lattices and the N-Best lists from the output of the recognizer...|$|R
