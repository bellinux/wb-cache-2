500|$|In 1916, Coach Yost {{shared his}} {{recollections}} of the Buffalo game with Big Bill Edwards: [...] "Buffalo University came to Michigan with a much-heralded team. They were coached by a Dartmouth man {{and had not}} been scored upon. Buffalo papers referred to Michigan as the Woolly Westerners, and the Buffalo enthusiasts placed bets that Michigan would not score." [...] The score {{at the end of}} the first half was 65 to 0. About fifteen minutes after the second half had started, Yost discovered a Buffalo player, Simpson, [...] "on Michigan's side of the field, covered up in a blanket." [...] Yost was curious and asked, [...] "Simpson, what are you doing over here? You are on the wrong side." [...] To which, Simpson replied, [...] "Don't say anything. I <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> at. The coach has put me in three times already and I'm not going in there again. Enough is enough for any one. I've had mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|Northwick seemed interested, {{and even}} touched, by the {{hardship}} {{he had worked}} to Pinney. [...] "They don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> now," [...] he suggested.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because--I want to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going myself. Wherever you go, I {{have reason}} to believe, I shall find that I happen to be going also." ...|$|E
5000|$|We {{were playing}} sets {{for three hours}} solid, and {{physically}} that was a real...I mean, when I {{came back from the}} last tour <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> didn't even <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going. We ended up in New York {{and the only thing that}} I could relate to was the instrument onstage. <b>I</b> just couldn't....I <b>was</b> just totally and completely spaced out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I wish <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> wish I wasn't anywhere." [...] He {{looked at}} her, and then dropped his eyes, with {{the effect of}} giving up a hopeless conundrum.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> snap-shotted {{twice before}} <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> Then Mr. Magg drew {{a sheet of}} paper towards him, and began to make notes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is I, O goddess!' replied Petru, rather timidly. 'I {{have lost}} my {{way on the}} heath, and do not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> to sleep this night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must be {{home before}} dark," [...] she told him. [...] "You see, the family don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> I haven't said {{anything}} to them about--about this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> now,' he said. 'We {{have not}} gone far from our course; another ten minutes and we shall be {{at the edge of}} the glacier.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We will go and sit up there," [...] she decided. [...] "He <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> to {{be found}} now so it doesn't matter. I should like to see him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{wanted to}} send a letter, you see, to let 'em <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> and tell poor Chloe that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> well off, 'cause she felt so dreadful, poor soul.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>was</b> <b>I</b> {{to think}} of that, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so frightened and {{confused}} that <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> or what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing? There;--now <b>I</b> have told you everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bon! I <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> now. I've {{been in a}} fog {{without a}} compass for nearly three days, and I didn't thought I was ever to see land again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I promise," [...] said Gascoyne, sternly. [...] "Pray cease this trifling, {{and if it}} is not {{inconsistent}} with your duty, let me <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> to be taken to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps it is,' said Christopher hurriedly, {{taking up}} his hat. 'Let me now wish you good-bye; and, of course, {{you will always}} <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and how to find me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{on the day}} of the accident--call it murder, if you will--I rode over on my machine, unannounced, to The Grange to see him. You <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> staying, you recollect--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not--well, {{you left}} me, {{in order to}} let our friends <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> that they might cast about for the means of getting me free. All this I understand; what next?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you wonder}} now {{that with all}} these things boiling in my head <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> putting down my foot that night? I just felt myself falling--then crash, and all dark.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you needn't {{be worried}} anybody'll be lookin' for me, 'cause there's {{nobody wants to}} <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> So go ahead, if I've been doin' {{anything}} you perfessors don't like." ...|$|E
6000|$|Have {{you thought}} of yourself, Arthur? What will {{you feel when you}} see him with me? What will you suspect when you're working in your office and don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear friend," [...] she said, [...] "do not magnify {{me into a}} {{physiological}} problem. I should only disappoint you terribly some day. I think I <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> puzzling you now----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why did I {{find her}} {{standing}} {{there like a}} goddess who had just stepped out of her cloud? Why did I look at her? Before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> the harm was done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ''Tis a {{delightful}} middle mind to <b>be</b> in. <b>I</b> know it, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> like it once; but <b>I</b> had scarcely <b>been</b> so {{long enough to}} <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> before <b>I</b> <b>was</b> gone past.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Parker {{began to}} {{identify}} as a lesbian {{in the late}} 1960s, and, in a 1975 interview with Anita Cornwell, stated that [...] "after my first relationship with a woman, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm mighty glad we met those men," [...] {{declared}} Gif. [...] "Now I <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> Thank goodness! {{we are not}} so {{very far}} {{out of the way}} after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{got to let}} {{the folks}} <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> for when I left it was allowed I'd be back by sunset. To-morrow I'll come {{prepared}} to stay {{the rest of the}} week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah if {{we could}} only get there {{it would be a}} relief. I should draw a long breath. There at least I <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> and what people are. But here one lives on hollow ground!" ...|$|E
5000|$|You {{thought that}} you <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> and when Baby, looks like youve been fooling you again You {{thought that you}} had got me all staked out Baby, looks like Ive been {{breaking}} out.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{what makes}} it so strange. We have hardly met for years. Why, he didn't even <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> The cable was sent to the bank and {{forwarded}} on. And <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he is!" ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he <b>is.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Dolores! Yes, poor Gerald's love! They {{are almost}} myths to me. Ah!" [...] as Lancelot opened his office-door, [...] "now I <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am!</b> And there's the old staircase! This {{is the real}} thing, and no mistake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am to live {{in these}} two rooms?" [...] he demanded. [...] "I am to let no one <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> to write no letters, to receive none? My duties are to be simply to treat you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's Dorlcote Mill--a {{good way}} off," [...] said Maggie. [...] "My father is Mr. Tulliver; but we mustn't let him <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> else he'll fetch me home again. Where does {{the queen of}} the gipsies live?" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> they <b>are,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> they <b>are,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> they <b>are</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, very good, sir!" [...] screamed Captain Boltrope, {{rubbing his}} hands and {{absolutely}} capering about the deck with rage. [...] "O d--n you! Of course you shall! O ho! the gunner's daughter! O, h--ll! this is too much! Boatswain's mate!" [...] Before <b>I</b> well <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> seized, borne to an eight-pounder, tied upon it and flogged! ...|$|R
60|$|Presently two warriors entered. The leader {{exhibited}} a unique method of discovering my whereabouts in the darkness. He advanced slowly, kicking out viciously before him. Finally he kicked {{me in the}} face. Then he <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
