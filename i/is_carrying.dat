5|$|The most {{challenging}} {{stage of the}} takeoff <b>is</b> <b>carrying</b> the speed from the inrun with sufficient height over the 'knoll', and achieving the correct trajectory down the hill. The knoll is the highest point of the hill itself, from which it begins to slope downwards.

A skilled athlete is able to aggressively 'snap' into the transition so as to clear the knoll with ease, thereby allowing them to focus completely on using their specialised aerodynamic flying technique to maximise distance further down the hill. Athletes of the highest skill level can consistently compensate for any lack of inrun speed with perfect timing {{off the table and}} an excellent transition.|$|E
