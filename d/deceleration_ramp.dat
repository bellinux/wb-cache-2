50|$|The parkway then {{traverses}} the State Boat Channel Bridge {{by way of}} a 665 ft-long {{bascule bridge}} modeled after the Mill Basin Drawbridge in Mill Basin, Brooklyn. The north foot of the bridge contains an unnumbered interchange to a private road on Captree Island, where the rest of the road is surrounded by protected land. On the section that crosses over the Great South Bay, via the Great South Bay Bridge, the New York City skyline can be faintly seen on a clear day. Originally a toll bridge, the remnants of the former toll plaza for the Great South Bay Bridge {{can be found on the}} north side in West Islip. At the cloverleaf interchange with NY 27A, the third northbound lane becomes the <b>deceleration</b> <b>ramp,</b> and from there the rest of the parkway is four lanes wide.|$|E
50|$|The {{failure to}} {{complete}} the Inner Loop left the Sousa Bridge's approaches incomplete and confusing. The bus and streetcar terminal were removed, and Pennsylvania Avenue SE now ran directly {{through the center of}} the circle. M Street was disconnected from the circle, and now dead-ended in a roundabout a block east of 12th Street SE. Unmarked Interstate 695 delivered three lanes of traffic to a one-lane on-ramp to the bridge, and traffic backed up for miles every day as a traffic light allowed only a few cars onto the bridge's southbound lanes during rush hour. Four lanes of traffic (two northbound, two southbound) passed beneath the bridge's terminus, dead-ending at a non-existent Inner Loop and connected haphazardly to the northeastern side of the circle. An off-ramp delivered most northbound bridge traffic around the incomplete Barney Circle and under the bridge onto Interstate 695 westbound. A dangerous right-hand turn with no <b>deceleration</b> <b>ramp</b> left local traffic coming to a swift halt to access 17th Street SE — but not Kentucky Avenue SE, which now had to be accessed from local streets. K Street SE now curved north and east around the west side of Barney Circle, and traffic lights on the street caused even more backups both on K Street and on the Sousa Bridge.|$|E
40|$|DPG- 21 XX- 00 X digital {{controllers}} {{are used}} primarily to govern diesel or gas fueled engines of generator sets. This microprocessor-based, digital controller performs {{across a wide}} speed range and allows adjustment of set speed and gain parameters with the built-in user interface. The COMM port provides access to all other controller settings, allowing adaptation to each application during service and initial configuration. Separately programmable Proportional, Integral, and Derivative gains are provided for tailoring controller response to many engine applications. Other adjustments include acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> <b>ramp</b> rates, idle speed set, hold time, and more. Properly tuned, this controller delivers fast engine response to speed or load change while providing precise stable isochronous operation. The controller’s internal FAILSAFE reacts instantly to loss of the engine speed signal, allowing the actuator to return to minimum fuel...|$|E
50|$|I-70 across central Missouri {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{stretches}} of Interstate Highway in the system, as some sections date back as far as the late 1950s. As a result, the exits often have short, substandard acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> <b>ramps,</b> and the median is relatively narrow. Certain spots of both directions of traffic are separated by no more than a Jersey barrier. Also, a number of overpasses have low clearance, especially railway overpasses. Long-term plans have been identified to expand the highway to between six and eight lanes across the middle of the state. Tolling the Interstate has become a possible alternative, although the public does not support this idea. According to the improveI70.com website, tolling would not start until all 189 mi of I-70 is reconstructed.|$|R
40|$|Chain {{conveyors}} are {{a specific}} type of conveyor often used in a variety of manufacturing and production applications, such as body and paint shops. These conveyors must typically interface with other types of conveyors such as cross-transfer conveyors, and also with other material-handling equipment such as lift tables and hold tables. Micromodeling of chain conveyors and their equipment interfaces requires close attention to numerous details. These details include not only static and operational properties of the chain conveyors themselves, but also the particulars of dimensional and operational interfaces of the conveyors and the equipment served by the conveyors, such as lift tables and the conveyor acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> <b>ramps.</b> In this paper, we first delineate the situations in which micromodeling of material-handling equipment is appropriate. We then present an overview of conveyor types and terminology. Next, we describe the challenges of modeling chain conveyors accurately, and our recommendations for meeting these challenges within the framework of typical modeling tools and simulation-study contexts. As an example, we present details of these recommendations relative to the AutoMod modeling tool. In conclusion, we summarize these recommendations and indicate promising directions for further development of modeling techniques and enhancement of model-building tools. 1 MACRO- VS. MICRO-MODELING Macro models are, by definition, over-view models with a &quot;coarse &quot; level of detail. In contrast, micro models incorporate a &quot;fine &quot; (high) level of detail (Ülgen, Shore, and Grajo 1994). The appropriate level of detail for a particular model within a simulation study, and hence the decision of whether to build a macro or a micro model, properly depends on the objectives of the study, availability o...|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, {{construction}} began on a third lane and a 12-foot shoulder lane between the Fairfax Drive entrance ramp (near George Mason Drive in Ballston) to I-66 west and the Sycamore Street ramp, a 1.9 mile distance. The entrance ramp acceleration lane and the exit <b>ramp</b> <b>deceleration</b> lanes were lengthened to form a continuous lane between both ramps. The 12-foot shoulder lane can carry emergency vehicles {{and can be used}} in emergency situations. This project was completed in December 2011.|$|R
40|$|AbstractRepetitive, brief target ramp {{movements}} {{every few}} seconds lead to anticipatory acceleration before each ramp onset and anticipatory <b>deceleration</b> before <b>ramp</b> offset. We assessed whether identifying novel changes in the pursuit target would alter this pattern of anticipatory pursuit. Without target identification (TI), anticipatory acceleration increased when intervals between ramps were regular, rather than random. It increased further when, between ramps, the target was invisible rather than stationary and visible. Anticipatory deceleration increased when the target was expected to stop rather than disappear at ramp offset. For TI trials, the pursuit target changed briefly into a Landolt C acuity target {{that had to be}} identified. Compared to no TI, anticipatory acceleration decreased when a stationary C always appeared just before ramp onset. It increased when a moving C appeared just after ramp onset, but only when the target was invisible between <b>ramps.</b> Anticipatory <b>deceleration</b> was reduced when a moving C appeared just before ramp offset, but did not increase when a stationary C appeared just after ramp offset. The changes were significant, but of small magnitude, suggesting that predictive pursuit, especially with a visible target between ramps, cannot be greatly influenced by attempts to selectively improve acuity at a particular phase of the stimulus...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to assess the effectiveness of the Graded Deceleration Display (GDD) that is designed to replace the rear center high mounted stop lamp on automobiles. Licensed drivers were treated in simulation to both a standard brake light displays (binary) and the GDD display while the lead vehicle (LV) varied its <b>deceleration</b> magnitude and <b>ramping</b> behavior. Results entailed that the graded system produced more accurate behavioral responses during deceleration, fewer collisions, and a safer following distance than the binary system. Future research should be concerned with solidifying this framework {{so that it can be}} used to improve safety, effectiveness, and efficiency for vehicle transportation. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Association (NHTSA) in 2003 stated that rear-end collision accidents were responsible for about 30 % of all collisions nationwide (Li & Milgram, 2008). In 1999, there were 6, 271, 524 crashes with an estimated 1, 848, 407 consisting of rear-end collisions (NHTSA, 1999 b). The causes for such accidents include delayed detection of the lead vehicle’s braking, inadequate headway between the following and leading vehicle, inattention, and poor visual cues due from the binary displa...|$|R
40|$|The {{storage ring}} NESR of the FAIR project will serve {{various kinds of}} experiments. Many modes of {{operation}} are considered employing stable and radioactive ion beams and antiprotons. For radioactive ions the cooling time is crucial for short-lived nuclei. These ions will be pre-cooled in the CR storage ring by stochastic cooling at an energy of 740 MeV/u. The cooling time in the NESR should not exceed the projected cooling time in the CR which is below 1 s, {{in order to make}} radioactive ions with lifetimes in the range of seconds available for experiments. For stable ions the cooling time requirements are more relaxed, but beams of highest phase space density will be required for precision spectroscopy. Antiprotons will be pre-cooled and accumulated in the CR-complex and transferred to the NESR at an energy of 3 GeV. For the low energy complex behind the NESR the antiprotons will be decelerated in the NESR to 30 MeV. Electron cooling at an antiproton energy of about 800 MeV will compensate diffusion due to imperfections of the deceleration process and increase the efficiency of deceleration. Finally electron cooling will provide high quality decelerated beams of ions and antiprotons. After deceleration the electron cooling system should provide cooling at a minimum energy of 30 MeV for antiprotons and of 4 MeV/u for ions. The electron cooling system must be able to provide electrons up to an energy of about 450 keV, which is beyond the energy range of existing electron cooling systems. <b>Deceleration</b> with a <b>ramping</b> time of 2 s will be applied to short-lived nuclei. The electron energy must be varied from the maximum energy needed for cooling after injection down to the lowest energy of 4 MeV/u which is the design energy for further deceleration in a linac in front of a trap system. A cooling system (Table 1) has been designed which is capable to provide the cooling power and to achieve the required cooling performance.
