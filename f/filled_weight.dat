50|$|E1Designated as Experiment 1 in {{the fall}} of 1940, the initial model {{consisting}} of four main components: fuel storage system, compressed gas storage system, igniter, and flame gun. The E1 had a single fuel tank vertical cylinder with two compartments, an upper and lower compartment. The upper compartment contained pressurized nitrogen that pushed the five gallons of fuel oil in the lower compartment through the barrel and into the flame gun. The fuel system for the E1 consisted of either diesel oil, fuel oil, or blends of gasoline and oil. An igniter, consisting of a compressed hydrogen cylinder and battery, was attached to the flame gun. The flame gun had two triggers, dispense fuel and ignition of fuel as it exited the metal barrel.Weighing in at 70 pounds when filled, the E1 was capable of ranges from fourteen to twenty-one yards. Issues - engineer board tests identified that the fuel-compressed gas reservoir was impractical, prone position firing was difficult, and as the E1 was firing, gas pressure decreased in the upper compartment tank lowering gas pressure to push the fuel in the lower compartment through the flame gun, thereby reducing weapon range. Additional issues were identified with the dependability, weight, and maneuverability of the E1 flame thrower system. E1R1The E1 was redesigned by the Chemical Warfare Service and labeled Experiment 1 Revision 1 and was ready for testing in March 1941. The compressed nitrogen was separated away from the fuel reservoir, a feature carried forward in all subsequent models. Additional improvements included the flame gun, valves, and ignition system. The E1R1's <b>filled</b> <b>weight</b> was reduced to 57 pounds and was capable of sustaining 15 to 20 yards for 15 to 20 seconds; the E1R1 weighed 28 pounds when empty. Issues - Weight, easily damaged parts, and access to the control valves were identified during testing as being problematic. M1Test board results {{led to the development of}} the M1 production model, consisting of a heavier weight, the M1 was more rugged and had a longer range as standardized for production in March 1942. The M1 system made it to the South Pacific theater by the end of the year. M1A1The invention of napalm led to its evaluation as a flamethrowing agent. Gasoline and oil mixtures sprayed as it left the barrel of the flame gun, whereas napalm thickened fuel left the barrel in a compact stream capable of ricocheting off of and into openings and subsequently sticking to flat surfaces. Initial tests showed that the current M1 platform was incapable of providing the ideal range with napalm. The Chemical Warfare Service was asked to adapt the napalm fuel system to the M1 platform to avoid procurement issues, thus facilitating the development of the M1A1 platform. Modifications included the fuel system, pressure regulator, valves, and the flame gun to facilitate the higher pressures required to achieve ideal ranges with the napalm. The M1A1 was capable of reliably firing to distances fifty yards away versus the M1's ideal firing range of twenty yards.|$|E

The baseline system is sized for an instrument heat leak of 50 mw. It contains 71 Kg of superfluid helium and has a total, <b>filled</b> <b>weight</b> of 217 Kg.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the factors that influence <b>fill</b> <b>weight</b> and weight variability of capsules produced on the In-Cap and to assess any differences in terms of capsule defects between gelatin and HPMC (Quali-V) shells. The In-Cap is an automatic tamping type capsule-filling machine and the low output of ≈ 3000 capsules/hour makes it ideal for early formulation development and phase I/IIa clinical supplies manufacture. Four commonly used excipients (Avicel PH 101, Avicel PH 302, A-Tab, and Prosolv HD 90) and a poorly flowing drug blend were encapsulated at various pin settings and powder bed heights. The average <b>fill</b> <b>weight</b> and coefficient of weight variation were determined. The percentage of defective capsules formed during encapsulation was calculated. Results of the study showed that pin setting was critical for controlling the <b>fill</b> <b>weight</b> and the weight variation. The order of pin setting with pin 1 (closer to the powder chute) set to a relatively higher position and pin 4 (before ejection) set to a lower position was found to give higher <b>fill</b> <b>weights</b> with relatively lower weight variability. The powder bed height influenced the <b>fill</b> <b>weight</b> for poorly flowing powders. The capsule machine speed did not appear to significantly influence the <b>fill</b> <b>weight.</b> The <b>fill</b> <b>weight</b> and weight variation were found to depend on the flow property of the material. A large percentage of defective capsules was obtained using HPMC shell size # 00. Some of the commonly observed defects included split caps and improperly closed filled capsules. In general, appropriate selection of pin settings and bed height can reduce the weight variability seen, especially with poorly flowing high-dose formulations...|$|R

The filling volume ratio is an index of pressure from 1 to 1. 3 to investigate the influence on <b>filling</b> <b>weights</b> of the internal parameters of a wick (permeability, effective pore radius and porosity) and heat transfer performance for LHP. The wick is manufactured, based on the standard and non-pressurized <b>filling</b> <b>weights</b> in the manufactured wick mold.

An acceptable filling performance was always achieved and was independent of the machine type employed.

Using the dosator nozzle machine, the plug formed was always denser than the maximum bulk density, whereas on the tamp filling machine for smallest granule size the maximum plug density could not be achieved with the settings employed. The results suggest that in situations where a low plug density is an essential prerequisite for drug dissolution and bioavailability the tamp filling machine appears the more suitable filling principle. However, if a greater extent of compression is required in order to fill large dose drugs or to use a smaller capsule size, the dosator nozzle principle might work more successfully for granules...|$|R

40|$|NoThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop SEDS-engineered budesonide particles suitable for dry powder inhalation delivery and to evaluate their aerosol performance across a range of passive dry powder inhalers (DPI). SEDS budesonide powders were manufactured in Nektar's SCF manufacturing plant and compared to the micronized drug and commercial powder (Pulmicort Turbuhaler, AstraZeneca). Aerosol performance was evaluated by determining emitted dose (ED) by a variation of the USP method and fine particle fraction (FPF) using Andersen cascade impaction. The SCF powder dispersed best in the Turbospin and Eclipse devices, exhibiting high EDs (70 %- 80 %) and relatively low variability (RSD 8 %- 13 %). Regardless of the device, the SEDS material outperformed both the micronized drug and the commercial powder, while exhibiting good batch-to-batch reproducibility (RSD < 5 %). All powders exhibited flow rate-dependent ED, albeit for the SEDS material it was minimized at reduced <b>fill</b> <b>weights.</b> This was attributed to inadequate and variable powder clearance from the capsules at low inspiratory flow rates, which was more pronounced in the Eclipse and Cyclohaler.

40|$|In {{the process}} of mining for earth resources, large {{underground}} voids called stopes are created that are later backfilled. For stability analysis of the backfilled stopes, {{it is necessary to}} understand the stress developments within the stope while the filling is in progress. Due to an arching effect, a substantial fraction of the <b>fill</b> <b>weight</b> is carried by the stope walls, depending on the physical characteristics of the walls. This paper describes the development of a laboratory model that simulates mine backfilling in an inclined stope and enables determination of the average vertical stress at any depth within the fill. The experimental results are validated against numerical models and stresses determined from an analytical expression. The effect of arching is the least when the stope is inclined at about 80 ° to the horizontal, giving highest vertical stresses at any depth. This fact is not captured in both the mathematical and numerical models developed in the past and the ones discussed herein. The model tests show that the lateral earth pressure coefficient is closer to K 0 for vertical stopes and Ka for inclined stopes. In the case of walls with dissimilar frictional characteristics, the analytical expression can still be used with an average value of the wall-fill friction angle...|$|R
