40|$|Electronic {{dance music}} (EDM) {{is a popular}} genre of mu-sic. In this paper, we propose a method to {{automatically}} detect the characteristic event in an EDM recording that {{is referred to as}} a drop. Its importance is reflected in the num-ber of users who leave comments in the general neighbor-hood of drop events in music on online audio distribution platforms like SoundCloud. The variability that character-izes realizations of drop events in EDM makes automatic drop detection challenging. We propose a two-stage ap-proach to drop detection that first models the sound char-acteristics during drop events and then incorporates tem-poral structure by zeroing in on a watershed moment. We also explore the possibility of using the drop-related social comments on the SoundCloud platform as weak reference labels to improve drop detection. The method is evaluated using data from SoundCloud. Performance is measured as the overlap between tolerance windows centered around the hypothesized and the actual <b>drop.</b> <b>Initial</b> experimental results are promising, revealing the potential of the pro-posed method for combining content analysis and social activity to detect events in music recordings. 1...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out for the deformation and breakup of liquid drop suspended in an oil tank which is decelerated by an impact. The experiments were conducted in a specially designed drop tower, in which the oil tank can be lifted up to about 1. 5 m high and dropped onto ground damper. A high speed camera was used to visualize the temporal development and breakup. Four recognizable different modes of the drop deformation have been found up to now from our experiments. The transitions between these modes appear {{to be related to}} the density ratio of the drop to the oil, the interfacial tension, the initial drop diameter and the impulse being generated by suddenly decelerating the oil tank. The deformation appears to be more severe if the density ratio, the initial drop diameter, or the impulse is increased, and vice versa. The interfacial tension between the drop and the ambient oil seems to play a suppression role against the drop deformation and breakup. The results of the transitions between these modes were summarized by “deformation and breakup maps ” where different modes are shown in the H-D plane (H is the height of the tank falling freely and D is <b>drop</b> <b>initial</b> diameter) for different values of the density ratio and interfacial tension...|$|E
40|$|We {{study how}} {{enforcing}} self-consistency in the statistical {{properties of the}} preshear and postshear stress on a fault {{can be used to}} constrain fault constitutive behavior beyond that required to produce a desired spatial and temporal evolution of slip in a single event. We explore features of rupture dynamics that (1) lead to slip heterogeneity in earthquake ruptures and (2) maintain these conditions following rupture, so that the stress field is compatible with the generation of aftershocks and facilitates heterogeneous slip in subsequent events. Our three-dimensional finite element simulations of magnitude 7 events on a vertical, planar strike-slip fault show that the conditions that lead to slip heterogeneity remain in place after large events when the dynamic stress <b>drop</b> (<b>initial</b> shear stress) and breakdown work (fracture energy) are spatially heterogeneous. In these models the breakdown work is on the order of MJ/m^ 2, which is comparable to the radiated energy. These conditions producing slip heterogeneity also tend to produce narrower slip pulses independent of a slip rate dependence in the fault constitutive model. An alternative mechanism for generating these confined slip pulses appears to be fault constitutive models that have a stronger rate dependence, which also makes them difficult to implement in numerical models. We hypothesize that self-consistent ruptures could also be produced by very narrow slip pulses propagating in a self-sustaining heterogeneous stress field with breakdown work comparable to fracture energy estimates of kJ/M^ 2...|$|E
40|$|Although many {{methods are}} {{available}} for producing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), the conventional carbon arc process remains the most popular due to its simplicity and large production rate. In the carbon arc, SWNTs are catalytically synthesized by rapidly evaporating a graphite anode impregnated with NiN metal catalyst from which the nanotubes grow in an inert atmosphere. However, high temperatures inside the carbon arc generate strong buoyancy driven convection, and it is hypothesized that the non-uniform environment created by this flow has a large effect on the growth and morphology of the SWNTs. To study the effect of buoyancy on the arc process, a miniature carbon arc apparatus was developed to synthesize SWNTs in a microgravity environment substantially free from these strong convective flows. The reactor was operated for either 2. 2 or 5 seconds during free-fall in the drop towers at the NASA Glenn Research Center. Two apparatus designs differing mainly in their production rate and power capacity were investigated. The first consisted of a miniaturized carbon arc employing a 1 mm diameter graphite anode and powered by a 0. 54 F capacitor bank charged to 65 V. The second, larger apparatus employed a 4 mm diameter anode and was powered by a portable battery pack capable of providing in excess of 300 amps at 30 volts to the arc {{for the duration of}} a 5 second <b>drop.</b> <b>Initial</b> results indicated that transient heating is a very large effect in the short-duration drop tower carbon arcs, and thermal equilibrium of the arc plasma, buffer gas, and apparatus was not attained during the short microgravity periods. In addition, removal of the buoyant convection by the microgravity now allowed clear observation of large jets of evaporated carbon vapor streaming from the anode and mixing with the inert buffer gas. The initial mixing of these jets with the cold buffer gas combined with the thermal transient made it difficult to establish a uniform high temperature environment around the arc in the 2. 1 to 5 second microgravity time interval, and even with a very high-powered arc, the arc region was cooler than in continuously operated arcs. Despite these difficulties, the miniature arc produced SWNTs in microgravity. However, given the large thermal transient to overcome, no dramatic difference in sample yield or composition was noted between normal gravity and q 2 -,andL%econd long microgravity runs...|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. In Marangoni dropwise condensation, condensate drops move spontaneously when a bulk temperature gradient {{is applied to the}} condensing surface. It was considered that the velocity of drop movement is strongly affected by the horizontal component of Marangoni force around a condensate drop. And it is easy to infer that the horizontal component of Marangoni force is decided by both strength of Marangoni force and shape (angle) of condensate drop. In previous studies, it was shown that the velocity of condensate drop movement increases with the increase of bulk surface tension gradient and has a strong relation to <b>initial</b> <b>drop</b> distance. <b>Initial</b> <b>drop</b> distance was adopted as a parameter to express the characteristics of drop velocity, since the qualitatively relations among <b>initial</b> <b>drop</b> distance, Marangoni force and shape of condensate drop inferred from the previous experimental results.

40|$|A {{formulation}} {{has been}} developed to describe the evaporation of dense or dilute clusters of binary-fuel drops. The binary fuel {{is assumed to be}} made of a solute and a solvent whose volatility is much lower than that of the solute. Convective flow effects, inducing a circulatory motion inside the drops, are taken into account, as well as turbulence external to the cluster volume. Results obtained with this model show that, similar to the conclusions for single isolated drops, the evaporation of the volatile is controlled by liquid mass diffusion when the cluster is dilute. In contrast, when the cluster is dense, the evaporation of the volatile is controlled by surface layer stripping, that is, by the regression rate of the drop, which is in fact controlled by the evaporation rate of the solvent. These conclusions are in agreement with existing experimental observations. Parametric studies show that these conclusions remain valid with changes in ambient temperature, initial slip velocity between <b>drops</b> and gas, <b>initial</b> <b>drop</b> size, <b>initial</b> cluster size, initial liquid mass fraction of the solute, and various combinations of solvent and solute.
