2500|$|Epitope {{modification}} or Cryptic epitope exposure – {{this mechanism}} of autoimmune disease {{is unique in}} {{that it does not}} result from a defect in the <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>system.</b> [...] Instead, disease results from the exposure of cryptic N-glycan (polysaccharide) linkages common to lower eukaryotes and prokaryotes on the glycoproteins of mammalian non-hematopoietic cells and organs [...] This exposure of phylogenically primitive glycans activates one or more mammalian innate immune cell receptors to induce a chronic sterile inflammatory state. [...] In the presence of chronic and inflammatory cell damage, the adaptive immune system is recruited and self–tolerance is lost with increased autoantibody production. [...] In this form of the disease, the absence of lymphocytes can accelerate organ damage, and intravenous IgG administration can be therapeutic. [...] Although this route to autoimmune disease may underlie various degenerative disease states, no diagnostics for this disease mechanism exist at present, and thus its role in human autoimmunity is currently unknown.|$|E
40|$|The immune and <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>systems</b> play an {{important}} role in the normal homeostasis of blood and blood cells and for immune responses to endogenous and exogenous processes and insults. In order to interpret histopathologic changes in the immune and <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>systems,</b> it is important to understand the normal anatomy and histology of the thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other tissues. The thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes can be categorized by anatomical compartments, each of which contributes to specific immune functions. Lesions may be diagnosed by interpretive or descriptive (semiquantitative) methods. The interpretation of these tissues by lesion in anatomical compartments should allow for better understanding of these reactions and more definitive pathologic findings. Proliferative lesions may be difficult to differentiate from lymphomas and leukemias. The use of immunohistochemistry, compartmental pathology, and methods for the evaluation of clonality will make interpretation easier...|$|R
40|$|The hypereosinophilic {{syndrome}} is a severe disease affecting multiple organ systems as the heart, skin, liver, spleen, urinary, gastrointestinal, nervous, and <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>systems.</b> The most important findings are eosinophilic infiltration and peripheral eosinophilic leukocytosis.

30|$|Body {{weight loss}} and an anaemic {{condition}} caused by pancytopenia were observed. These conditions were transient, and recovery was evident {{at the end of}} the observation period. No histopathological changes were observed in the normal organs, but changes were observed in the spleen and sternum bone marrow. Therefore, systemic toxicity of 90 Y-anti-ROBO 1 was transient and limited to <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

Embryological hand development occurs simultaneously with growth {{and development of the}} cardiovascular, neurologic and <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>systems.</b> Thumb hypoplasia has been described in 30 syndromes wherein those abnormalities have been seen. A syndrome is a combination of three or more abnormalities. Examples of syndromes with an hypoplastic thumb are Holt-Oram syndrome, VACTERL association and thrombocytopenia absent radius (TAR syndrome).|$|R
50|$|The Center for Stem Cell Biology is a {{collaborative}} {{division of the}} Life Sciences Institute where stem cells are studied in a cross-disciplinary manner. At the Center for Stem Cell Biology, questions addressed include fundamental inquiries into tissue development and cell communication. Morrison himself investigates the mechanisms underlying the functioning of stem cells in the nervous and <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>systems.</b> Morrison's lab has disproven the immortal strand hypothesis for blood-forming stem cells.|$|R

50|$|Certain {{developmental}} cells may {{be similar}} to or the same as other endothelial progenitors, though not typically referred to as EPCs. Hemangioblasts (or their in vitro counterpart, blast - colony forming cells) are cells believed to give rise to both the endothelial and <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>systems</b> during early development. Angioblasts {{are believed to be}} a form of early progenitor or stem cell which gives rise to the endothelium alone. More recently, mesoangioblasts have been theorized as a cell giving rise to multiple mesodermal tissues.|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of a stem cell niche, or physiological microenvironment, consisting of specialized cells that directly and indirectly participate in stem cell regulation has been verified for mammalian adult stem cells in the intestinal, neural, epidermal, and <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>systems.</b> In light of these findings, it has been proposed that a “cancer stem cell niche” also exists and that interactions with this tumor niche may specify a self-renewing population of tumor cells. We discuss emerging data that {{support the idea of}} a veritable cancer stem cell niche and propose several models for the relationship between cancer cells and their niches...|$|R

Growth and motor skills are affected, and mental retardation also occurs.|$|E
50|$|There {{are almost}} no {{symptoms}} of acute exposure to PAHs, because they cause no acute toxicity. After chronic exposure, PAHs do cause {{signs and symptoms}} of toxicity. All health effects associated with chronic exposure to PAHs are in table 4. Exposure to PAHs causes adverse side-effects on skin, eyes, respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>system</b> and genitourinary system.|$|E
50|$|MBP was {{initially}} sequenced in 1971 after isolation from myelin membranes. Since that time, knockout mice deficient in MBP that showed decreased amounts of CNS myelination and a progressive disorder characterized by tremors, seizures, and early death have been developed. The human gene for MBP is on chromosome 18; the protein localizes to the CNS and to various {{cells of the}} <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
40|$|Long-term stable mixed chimerism is a {{rare and}} poorly {{understood}} phenomenon post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This study aims {{to shed light on}} whether the two <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>systems</b> in patients with mixed chimerism remain functional. Additionally, we investigate possible immunologic differences in these individuals compared to patients with only donor derived immune cells. Patients with donor and mixed chimerism, at median 10 (5 - 16) years post-HSCT for non-malignant diseases, were assessed regarding clinical situation and immune system (phenotypical and functional). No difference in long-term outcome was seen in terms of general wellbeing, central phenotypic immune system features (e. g., differentiation status, CD 4 /CD 8 ratio, B and NK-cell frequency) and antibody responses to immunizations. At a median of 10 years post transplantation, patients with mixed chimerism had significantly higher IgG 3 and platelet levels. Additionally, these patients had higher NKT-cell levels (CD 94 +CD 8 + and CD 56 +CD 8 +) than patients with donor chimerism. In depth phenotypic analysis of patients with mixed chimerism demonstrated recipient-derived fractions in most immune cell lineages (e. g., T-cell, B-cell and NK-cell subsets). Recipient cells were also capable of responding to mitogenic stimulation with production of several cytokines. In conclusion, long-term mixed chimerism did not negatively affect patient wellbeing and long-term outcome. Moreover, recipient-derived immunity may still be functional in these patients, suggesting an active state of tolerance and immunologic dependence on both <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|When {{studying}} transcription factors, it {{is necessary}} to investigate posttranslational modifications. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are typical of the modification enzymes involved in chromatin regulation. HATs acetylate the transcription factors (nonhistone proteins) as well as histones. Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are transcription factors that bind to the interferon regulatory element (IRF-E) and are involved in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and the immune and <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>systems.</b> During the process of binding to a specific DNA element, IRFs also bind to coactivators such as HATs and become modified. This review looks at how IRFs associate with HATs, p 300, and PCAF, and thereby contribute to transcriptional activation...|$|R
30|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} the antitumour effects and {{side effects of}} 90 Y-anti-ROBO 1 for an injection dose of 6.7  MBq. We determined the injection dose of 6.7  MBq, based on an injection dose of 7.4  MBq that provided maximal antitumour efficacy without animal mortality [21]. The side effects, such as bone marrow suppression and animal mortality, are the main limiting factors of dose-escalation for enhancement of the therapeutic effect. In the toxicity study, we observed that the damage to organs was transient and limited to the <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>systems.</b> Hence, our data suggest {{that it might be}} possible to administer a higher dose of 90 Y-anti-ROBO 1. A dose-escalation study is needed to determine a maximal tolerated dose.|$|R
50|$|HSCs can {{replenish}} all {{blood cell}} types (i.e., are multipotent) and self-renew. A {{small number of}} HSCs can expand to generate {{a very large number}} of daughter HSCs. This phenomenon is used in bone marrow transplantation, when a small number of HSCs reconstitute the <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>system.</b> This process indicates that, subsequent to bone marrow transplantation, symmetrical cell divisions into two daughter HSCs must occur.|$|E
50|$|As of 2013, Thailand still {{considers}} Hematopoietic {{stem cell}} transplants as experimental. Kampon Sriwatanakul {{began with a}} clinical trial in October 2013 with 20 patients. 10 are going to receive stem-cell therapy for Type-2 diabetes and the other 10 will receive stem-cell therapy for emphysema. Chotinantakul's research is on Hematopoietic cells and their role for the <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>system</b> function in homeostasis and immune response.|$|E
50|$|Gene {{therapy is}} {{currently}} being studied as a possible treatment for chronic granulomatous disease. CGD is well-suited for gene therapy since it {{is caused by a}} mutation in single gene which only affects one body system (the <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>system).</b> Viruses have been used to deliver a normal gp91 gene to rats with a mutation in this gene, and subsequently the phagocytes in these rats were able to produce oxygen radicals.|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} hematopoietic {{oncology}} has traditionally {{focused on the}} study of hematopoietic cell autonomous genetic events in an effort to understand malignant transformation and develop therapeutics. Although highly rewarding in both aspects, this cell autonomous approach has failed to fully satisfy our need to understand tumor cell behavior and related clinical observations. In recent years, it has been increasingly recognized that the tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role in cancer initiation and progression. This review will discuss recent experimental evidence in support of this view derived from investigations in both epithelial and <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>systems.</b> Based on this, conceptual views and therapeutic implications will be provided on the emerging role of the bone marrow microenvironment in leukemogenesis...|$|R
40|$|McLeod {{syndrome}} is an X-linked multisystem disorder characterized by abnormalities in the neuromuscular and <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>systems.</b> We have assembled a cosmid contig of 360 kb that encompasses the McLeod gene locus. A 50 kb deletion {{was detected by}} screening DNA from patients with radiolabeled whole cosmids, and two transcription units were identified within this deletion. The mRNA expression pattern of one of them, designated as XK, correlates closely to the McLeod phenotype. XK encodes a novel protein with structural characteristics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane transport proteins. Nucleotide sequence analysis of XK from two unrelated McLeod patients has identified point mutations at conserved splice donor and acceptor sites. These findings provide direct evidence that XK is responsible for McLeod syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Central {{nervous and}} <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>systems</b> share {{developmental}} features. We report that thrombopoietin (TPO), a stimulator of platelet formation, {{acts in the}} brain as a counterpart of erythropoietin (EPO), a hematopoietic growth factor with neuroprotective properties. TPO is most prominent in postnatal brain, whereas EPO is abundant in embryonic brain and decreases postnatally. Upon hypoxia, EPO and its receptor are rapidly reexpressed, whereas neuronal TPO and its receptor are down-regulated. Unexpectedly, TPO is strongly proapoptotic in the brain, causing death of newly generated neurons through the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 pathway. This effect is not only inhibited by EPO but also by neurotrophins. We suggest that the proapoptotic function of TPO helps to select for neurons that have acquired target-derived neurotrophic support...|$|R
50|$|Developmentally, the {{endothelium}} {{arises in}} close contact with the <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>system.</b> This, and the existence of hemogenic endothelium, led to a belief and search for adult hemangioblast- or angioblast-like cells; cells which could give rise to functional vasculature in adults. The existence of endothelial progenitor cells has been posited since the mid-twentieth century, however their existence was not confirmed until the 1990s when Asahara et al. published the discovery of the first putative EPC.|$|E
50|$|In animal studies, navitoclax {{was found}} to be a senolytic agent, {{inducing}} apoptosis in senescent, but not non-senescent cells. Oral administration of ABT263 to either sublethally irradiated or normally aged mice reduced senescent cells, including senescent bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and senescent muscle stem cells. This depletion mitigated total-body irradiation-induced premature aging of the <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>system</b> and rejuvenated the aged hematopoietic stem cells and muscle stem cells in normally aged mice.|$|E
50|$|The Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp) is a 502-amino acid protein {{expressed}} in {{cells of the}} <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>system.</b> In the inactive state, WASp exists in an autoinhibited conformation with sequences near its C-terminus binding to a region near its N-terminus. Its activation is dependent upon CDC42 and PIP2 acting to disrupt this interaction, causing the WASp protein to 'open'. This exposes a domain near the WASp C-terminus that binds to and activates the Arp2/3 complex. Activated Arp2/3 nucleates new F-actin.|$|E
40|$|Within {{the complex}} {{cellular}} arrangement {{found in the}} bone marrow stroma there exists a subset of nonhematopoietic cells referred to as mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPC). These cells can be expanded ex vivo and induced, either in vitro or in vivo, to terminally differentiate into at least seven types of cells: osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes, tenocytes, myotubes, astrocytes and hematopoietic-supporting stroma. This broad multipotentiality, the feasibility to obtain MPC from bone marrow, cord and peripheral blood and their transplantability support the impact {{that the use of}} MPC will have in clinical settings. However, a number of fundamental questions about the cellular and molecular biology of MPC still need to be resolved before these cells can be used for safe and effective cell and gene therapies intended to replace, repair or enhance the physiological function of the mesenchymal and/ or <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractHow {{growth factors}} {{influence}} {{the fate of}} multipotent progenitor cells is not well understood. Most hematopoietic growth factors act selectively as survival factors, rather than instructively as lineage determination signals. In the neural crest, neuregulin instructively promotes gliogenesis, but how alternative fates are determined is unclear. We demonstrate that bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP 2) induces the basic–helix-loop-helix protein MASH 1 and neurogenesis in neural crest stem cells. In vivo, MASH 1 + cells are located near sites of BMP 2 mRNA expression. Some smooth muscle differentiation is also observed in BMP 2. A related factor, transforming growth factor β 1 (TGFβ 1), exclusively promotes smooth muscle differentiation. Like neuregulin, BMP 2 and TGFβ 1 act instructively rather than selectively. The neural crest and <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>systems</b> may therefore utilize growth factors in different ways to generate cellular diversity...|$|R
