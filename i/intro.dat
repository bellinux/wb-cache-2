5000|$|The demos and <b>intros</b> {{for modern}} {{platforms}} are compressed either by general-purpose executable compressors (such as UPX) or programs {{specifically designed for}} the compression of small <b>intros.</b> The decompressor stubs integrated in 4K <b>intros</b> are often well under 200 bytes in size. Some Windows-based 4K <b>intros</b> may even wrap themselves inside DOS-based [...] executables in order to eliminate the header bytes. Decompression facilities provided by the operating system may also be used.|$|R
50|$|At that moment, levering out copy {{protection}} decreased in importance for some artists inside the scene. They felt that programming ambitious <b>Intros</b> was more challenging.

500|$|... 1980s {{software}} crackers added custom introductory credits sequences (<b>intros)</b> {{to programs}} whose copy protection they had removed. Increasing computing power allowed for more complex <b>intros,</b> and the demoscene formed when focus {{shifted to the}} <b>intros</b> instead of the cracks. The goal became to create the best 3-D demos in real-time with {{the least amount of}} software code. Disk storage was too slow for this; graphics had to be calculated on the fly and without a pre-existing game engine.|$|R

50|$|Many size-restricted <b>intros</b> use {{procedural}} {{techniques to}} generate content such as textures, 3D objects and music.

5|$|Madonna {{has only}} {{performed}} this song live once, on The Virgin Tour in 1985. It {{was the first}} song of the second act of the show. Madonna wore a black, fringed micro-top and similar skirt, with her belly-button exposed, {{and a number of}} crucifixes in different sizes, hanging from different parts of her body. As the guitar <b>intro</b> of the song started, Madonna appeared on the side-stage and started dancing energetically, while flashlights fell on her. While singing the song, she sometimes opened her jacket and sometimes straddled the steel structure present on the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main stage. It was included on the video release, titled , which was shot in Detroit.|$|E

The subsequent album Bays was released the following year on 23 October 2015, reaching the number 1 in New Zealand and 12 In Australia. The album title is derived from their home base in Wellington where the majority of the album was written.

Peter Dinklage {{takes the place of}} Sean Bean as the first credit during the <b>intro</b> sequence.

5|$|Jonathan Nolan {{designed}} the film's official website. As with the marketing strategy of The Blair Witch Project, the website {{was intended to}} provide further clues and hints to the story, while not providing any concrete information. After a short <b>intro</b> on the website, the viewer is shown a newspaper clipping detailing Leonard's murder of Teddy. Clicking on highlighted words in the article leads to more material describing the film, including Leonard's notes and photographs as well as police reports. The filmmakers employed another tactic by sending out Polaroid pictures to random people, depicting a bloody and shirtless Leonard pointing at an unmarked spot on his chest. Since Newmarket distributed the film themselves, Christopher Nolan edited the film's trailers himself. Sold to inexpensive cable-TV channels like Bravo and A, and websites such as Yahoo and MSN, the trailers were key to the film gaining widespread public notice.|$|E

The game required a special compression chip in its cartridge to compress and store all of the game's data due to possessing graphics that pushed the limits of the aging Super Famicom. Additionally, the game had voice acting for the game's <b>intro</b> and voice clips that played during the game's battle gameplay, a rarity for games on the system.|$|E
