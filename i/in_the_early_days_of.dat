5|$|As a {{classical}} singer, Turunen sings with classical vocal technique. She explained that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Nightwish, {{it was difficult}} to combine classical technique with the metal sound in a way that gave her liberty of action without damaging her vocal cords. Classical techniques helped her to play with her voice, so she decided not to pursue extra training in rock/pop singing.|$|E
5|$|By 1959, the 559th had 6,000 {{personnel}} in two regiments alone, the 70th and 71st, not including combat troops in security roles or North Vietnamese and Laotian civilian laborers. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the conflict the trail was used strictly for the infiltration of manpower. This {{was due to}} the fact that Hanoi could supply its southern allies much more efficiently by sea.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Twitter, tweets {{were stored}} in MySQL {{databases}} that were temporally sharded (large databases were split based on time of posting).

5|$|After the {{planning}} for the invasion, Dutton took command of 3 Commando Brigade, which was already serving in Afghanistan. In 2003, he led the brigade into the start of Iraq War, supported by units from the British Army {{as well as the}} United States Marine Corps, making Dutton the first British officer to command American troops since the Second World War. He commanded his men through heavy resistance from Iraqi forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the war.|$|E
5|$|Although {{little is}} known of Ordener's youth, {{he was the son}} of commoners and joined the legion of the Prince of Conde (cousin to the king) at the age of 18 (1776). He was {{assigned}} as a private of the Boufflers Dragoons, part of this legion. In 1783, he was appointed to the quartermaster corps and in 1787, he was promoted to warrant officer. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the French Revolution, he adopted its principles with zeal and enthusiasm.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the first}} New Zealander to be awarded the Victoria Cross, Heaphy was an {{accomplished}} artist. His watercolours, mostly produced between 1841 and 1855, are an important record of many scenes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> European settlement in New Zealand. Many of his works {{have been published in}} histories of New Zealand but his name is best known now through the Heaphy Track in the north-west corner of the South Island. He and Brunner were probably the first Europeans to walk through this area of the South Island and the Heaphy Track, though he never followed its route, is named in his honour.|$|E

He hoped for an independent command, but his desires were thwarted in two instances: Lee chose Lt. Gen. Jubal Early to lead an expedition north through the Shenandoah Valley and threaten Washington, and Davis chose Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood to replace the faltering Joseph E. Johnston in the Atlanta Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Dawson City {{was founded}} in 1896 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the Klondike Gold Rush, {{alongside}} the Yukon River in north-western Canada. Swelled by would-be gold-miners and adventurers, Dawson's population soared to 30,000 {{at the height of}} the rush in 1898. Dawson declined in size again as many of the immigrants left, but it was appointed the Territorial Capital of the new Yukon Territory in 1900, and by the following year it had a stable population of around 10,000.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the mechanical ore crusher in 1804 the tasks traditionally carried out by bal maidens began to be mechanised. Despite this, the rapid growth of the mines in comparison to the slow spread of mechanisation meant the number of bal maidens appears to have risen steadily, although statistics for the number of women employed in the mines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> industrialisation are incomplete and a few are contradictory.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> <b>days</b> of {{railways}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, most {{lines were}} built as double-track {{because of the}} difficulty of co-ordinating operations before the invention of the telegraph.

5|$|For {{several decades}} {{following}} {{the founding of}} the university, the major student societies on grounds were the debating societies. Several of these societies, notably the Jefferson Literary and Debating Society and the Washington Literary Society and Debating Union, are still active today. These and other debating societies that are no longer in existence, such as the Philomathean Society and the Parthenon Society, served as the primary means of student societal activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the University.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Dunedin, it was {{impossible}} for a dray to reach the Caversham Valley in wet weather unless it went by a circuitous route around the hills. Valpy solved this problem by hiring men at his own expense to build a crude road from the southern end of Princes Street to his farm at Forbury. This formed the basis for later roads into the suburb. The road curved {{around the edge of the}} hills at the Glen to avoid a large swamp, the site of which is currently occupied by Carisbrook sports ground.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> his administration, Leggett {{took the}} lead {{on a number of}} {{controversial}} issues. To help alleviate transportation funding difficulties and move County transit projects forward, he proposed a statewide gas tax increase, a position he first articulated in his race for County Executive. This proposal, which happened {{in the midst of a}} state budget crunch and in response to high levels of traffic congestion in the county, was supported by the County Council but largely ignored by incoming Governor Martin O'Malley. Leggett continued to advocate for the increase throughout his term.|$|E
