The area was also claimed by Pennsylvania, which refused to recognize the Connecticut titles. Allen, after being promised land, traveled to the area and began stirring up not just Pennsylvania authorities but also his long-time nemesis, <b>Governor</b> <b>Clinton</b> of New York, by proposing that a new state be carved out of the disputed area and several counties of New York. The entire affair was more bluster than anything else, and was resolved amicably when Pennsylvania agreed to honor the Connecticut titles.|$|E

The British government ordered Clinton to convene the Albany Congress of 1754 to repair the Covenant Chain. At the Congress, the Mohawk insisted that the alliance would be restored only if Johnson were reinstated as their agent.|$|E

25|$|After King George's War, Johnson {{was caught}} between rival New York {{political}} factions. One faction {{was led by}} Governor George Clinton, who had appointed Johnson as New York's Indian agent and, in 1750, appointed him to the Governor's Council. <b>Governor</b> <b>Clinton</b> urged the New York Assembly to repay Johnson's outstanding wartime expenses, which amounted to £2,000. Repayment was blocked by Clinton's political rivals, a faction led by Lieutenant Governor James De Lancey, who {{was connected to the}} Albany Indian commissioners whom Johnson had supplanted.

500|$|In {{response}} to calls from <b>Governor</b> <b>Clinton,</b> General George Washington authorized {{the use of}} Continental Army forces, assigning the operation to Lieutenant Colonel William Butler (no relation to the Loyalist Butlers) of the 4th Pennsylvania Regiment.

500|$|<b>Governor</b> <b>Clinton,</b> when {{alerted to}} the first skirmish, had {{immediately}} sent to Putnam for reinforcements. [...] Shortly after sending that message he learned from scouts that Sir Henry's forces were divided. [...] While waiting for reinforcements (that never came because of Sir Henry's successful feints) his brother James sent 100 men from Fort Clinton toward Doodletown, while he sent another company from Fort Montgomery to oppose Campbell's force.|$|E
500|$|The primary camp at Peekskill, {{which any}} British naval {{movements}} {{would need to}} pass, had roughly 600 men. [...] Of {{the men at the}} three sites, about 1,000 were regular troops, while the remainder were short-term New York militia. [...] Putnam's forces had originally been larger, but General Washington had ordered some of Putnam's troops to assist either his (Washington's) defense against Howe or Gates' defense against Burgoyne, and a number of local militia companies had been dismissed when Howe's movements became known. Putnam received word of the arrival of transports in New York on September 29, and wrote <b>Governor</b> <b>Clinton</b> for assistance, who immediately came south from Kingston to take charge of the forts.|$|E

500|$|The {{detachment}} from Fort Montgomery numbered about 100 men, and included a small artillery piece commanded by Captain John Lamb. [...] Setting up a defensive position about one mile (1.6km) from the fort, they engaged Campbell's tired forces with spirit. [...] While they were eventually forced to retreat, {{they were able}} to spike the field piece before abandoning it to the British. [...] After another stand closer to the fort, supported by 12-pound piece, they again retreated (again not before spiking the cannon). [...] Due to this dogged defense, Campbell was not in position until about one hour before sunset (having left Doodletown at around 10 am). [...] Offered the chance to surrender, <b>Governor</b> <b>Clinton</b> refused, and the battle was joined.|$|E
500|$|Early in 1779, <b>Governor</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{issued a}} {{proclamation}} {{stating that the}} state of New York would honor the Wentworth grants, if the settlers would recognize New York's political jurisdiction over the Vermont territory. Allen wrote another pamphlet in response, entitled An [...] Address to the Inhabitants of the State of Vermont; with Remarks on a Proclamation under the Hand of his Excellency George Clinton, Esq; Governor of the State of New York. In typical style, he castigated the governor for issuing [...] "romantic proclamations ... calculated to deceive woods people", and for his [...] "folly and stupidity". Clinton's response, once he recovered his temper, was to issue another proclamation little different from the first. Allen's pamphlet circulated widely, including among members of Congress, and was successful in casting the Vermonters' case in a positive light.|$|E
500|$|The main {{approach}} to Fort Clinton was via a {{narrow strip of}} land about [...] wide between a small lake and the river, which, {{in addition to being}} covered by the fort's cannons, <b>Governor</b> <b>Clinton</b> had protected by placing abatis to impeded the British advance. [...] Sir Henry sent the 63rd Foot around the lake to attack the fort from the northwest, while he first sent the light companies of the 7th and 26th regiments and a company of Anspach grenadiers against the main works, followed by the 26th Foot and a detachment from the 17th Light Dragoons, and then the remaining British and German companies. [...] As at Fort Montgomery, the defenders were eventually overwhelmed. [...] Those that surrendered, however, were not subjected to some of the savagery that took place to the north. [...] A number of the garrison, including General Clinton, escaped by scrambling down the embankment to the river, where gunboats took them to safety across the river.|$|E

500|$|On the foggy {{morning of}} October 6, Sir Henry Clinton landed 2,100 men at Stony Point {{on the west}} side of the Hudson and, with the {{assistance}} of a Loyalist guide, marched them up onto a local rise called the [...] "Timp". [...] After descending the other side to a place called Doodletown, they encountered a scouting party that <b>Governor</b> <b>Clinton</b> had sent out for reconnaissance, which retreated toward Fort Clinton after a brief exchange of fire. [...] Sir Henry then divided his force into two attack groups to take the forts. [...] A force of about 900 men under Lieutenant Colonel Campbell, composed of the 52nd and 57th regiments, a detachment of Hessian chasseurs, and about 400 Loyalists led by Beverley Robinson, began the [...] trek around the gorge toward Fort Montgomery, while Sir Henry waited with the remaining 1,200 men at Doodletown before starting on the trail to Fort Clinton in order to give Campbell time to make the longer journey before beginning simultaneous attacks on the two forts.|$|E

2500|$|In 1782 the fractious {{nature of}} Vermont's {{internal}} politics became {{a problem for}} the republic's quest for statehood. [...] The southeast corner of the republic (present-day Brattleboro and the surrounding area) harbored strong political support for rejoining New York. [...] In January, the [...] "east side Yorkers" [...] made another in a series of petitions to <b>Governor</b> <b>Clinton</b> and the Congress, complaining in part about the ongoing [...] "intrigue with Canada". [...] This led Clinton to call a special meeting of the New York assembly to discuss the [...] "dangerous intercourse" [...] going on between Vermont and the British, in which they decided to forward papers on the matter to Congress, and move to enforce the state's authority over the territory.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} this {{negative}} publicity, New York's assembly in April passed a bill pardoning the New Hampshire grantees of offenses they may have committed, and recognizing, without requiring additional payment, the New Hampshire grants and those issued later by the Vermont Republic. [...] This appeared to clear the significant legal roadblocks to Vermont's statehood, but the east side Yorkers {{continued to be a}} persistent problem, with <b>Governor</b> <b>Clinton</b> almost encouraging them to engage in acts of resistance against the Vermont administration, even issuing commissions for New York judicial positions covering the affected area. [...] The situation got bad enough that Ethan Allen, in some secrecy, raised 250 men and marched on the town of Guilford, which was the epicenter of Yorker activity. [...] This resulted in the arrest, trial, and banishment of the Yorker ringleaders in October 1782, and the seizure of some of their property.
