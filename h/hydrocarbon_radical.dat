40|$|ABSTRACT: Stable {{hydrocarbon}} {{radicals are}} able to withstand ambient conditions. Their combination with a supporting surface is a promising route toward novel functionalities or carbon-based magnetic systems.

While H-abstraction reactions between radicals and H-donors {{have been}} well-studied, understanding of structure-reactivity relationships remains surprisingly incomplete.

In this paper, these compounds were derivatized with trifluoroacetic (TFA) anhydride and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry using electron ionization in positive mode. Gas chromatographic separation for TFA derivatives of all compounds was successfully resolved using an Equity- 5 fused silica capillary column with a poly (5 % diphenyl- 95 % dimethylsiloxane) stationary phase.

40|$|The {{formation}} of re-deposited layers consisting of hydrocarbon compounds is of major {{concern for the}} development of next-step devices, because the hydrogen bound in these layers contributes to tritium retention in a future fusion reactor. This film formation might be controlled by using a liner in the divertor pump duct to trap or transform neutral growth precursors before they deposit in remote areas of the vacuum vessel. For the understanding of film formation in such a liner the knowledge of sticking coefficients of the growth precursors is mandatory. Therefore, experiments based on the cavity technique were performed to measure surface loss probabilities of hydrocarbon radicals. In addition sticking coefficients of methyl radicals were measured directly applying well-characterized quantified radical beams. To simulate film formation in a liner, a test experiment was performed consisting of a stainless steel tube, which was exposed to a low-temperature plasma from acetylene. The variation of the film thickness along the inner surface of this tube after plasma exposure can be described by a flux comprising of different neutral <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>radical</b> species using the previously determined sticking coefficients.

The practical significance {{of this type of}} reaction with polyatomic hydrocarbons is manifest, which has led to many kinetics studies. The detailed understanding of these reactions requires corresponding dynamics studies. However, in comparison to the A + HX {radical} AH + X reactions, the study of the dynamics of A + HR {yields} AH + R reactions is much more difficult, both experimentally and theoretically (here and in the following, A stands for an atom, X stands for a halogen atom, and R stands for a polyatomic <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>radical).</b> The complication stems from the structured R, in contrast to the structureless X.

Velocity-map images of ground-state bromine atoms (Br), spin-orbit excited bromine atoms (Br*) and C 3 H 5 hydrocarbon radicals reveal the kinetic energies of these various photofragments. Both Br and Br* atoms are predominantly generated via repulsive excited electronic states in a prompt photodissociation {{process in which the}} hydrocarbon co-fragment is a cyclopropyl radical. However, the images obtained at the mass of the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>radical</b> fragment identify a channel with total kinetic energy greater than that deduced from the Br and Br* images, and with a kinetic energy distribution that exceeds the energetic limit for Br + cyclopropyl radical products. The velocity-map images of these C 3 H 5 fragments have lower angular anisotropies than measured for Br and Br*, indicating molecular restructuring during dissociation. The high kinetic energy C 3 H 5 signals are assigned to allyl radicals generated by a minor photochemical pathway which involves concerted C-Br bond dissociation and cyclopropyl ring-opening following single UV-photon absorption. Slow photofragments also contribute to the velocity map images obtained at the C 3 H 5 radical mass, but corresponding slow Br atoms are not observed. These features in the images are attributed to C 3 H 5 + from the photodissociation of the C 3 H 5 Br+ molecular cation following two-photon ionization of the parent compound.

40|$|Abstract. Reburning {{technology}} has been developed to adopt various commercial combustion systems. Fuel lean reburning is an advanced reburning method to reduce NOx economically without using burnout air, however {{it is not easy}} to get high NOx reduction efficiency. In the fuel lean reburning system, the localized fuel rich eddies are used to establish partial fuel rich regions so that the NOx can react with <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>radical</b> restrictively. In this paper, a new advanced reburning method which supplies reburn fuel with oscillatory motion is introduced to increase NOx reduction rate effectively. To clarify whether forced oscillating injection of reburn fuel can effectively reduce NOx emission, experimental tests were conducted in vertical combustion furnace. Experiments were performed in flames stabilized by a gas burner. The natural gas is used as both main and reburn fuel and total thermal input is about 40 kW. The forced oscillating injection of reburn fuel is realized by electronic solenoid valve, so that fuel rich region and fuel lean region is established alternately. In the fuel rich region, NOx is converted to N 2 by reburning reaction, however unburned hydrocarbon and CO is oxidized in fuel lean zone and mixing zone at downstream where slightly fuel lean region is formed by mixing of two regions. The NOx reduction rate increases up to 41 % by forced oscillating reburn motion. And this paper makes clear that in order to decrease NOx when oscillating reburn fuel injection system is adopted, the control of factors such as frequency and duty ratio is very important...|$|E

To validate the ReaxFF potential obtained after parameter optimization, {{we performed a}} range of NVT-MD simulations on various hydrocarbon/O 2 systems. From simulations on methane/O 2, o-xylene/O 2, propene/O 2, and benzene/O 2 mixtures, we found that ReaxFF obtains the correct reactivity trend (propene> o-xylene> methane> benzene), following the trend in the C-H bond strength in these hydrocarbons. We also tracked in detail the reactions during a complete oxidation of isolated methane, propene, and o-xylene to a CO/CO 2 /H 2 O mixture {{and found that the}} pathways predicted by ReaxFF are in agreement with chemical intuition and our QM results. We observed that the predominant initiation reaction for oxidation of methane, propene, and o-xylene under fuel lean conditions involved hydrogen abstraction of the methyl hydrogen by molecular oxygen forming hydroperoxyl and <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>radical</b> species. While under fuel rich conditions with a mixture of these hydrocarbons, we observed different chemistry compared with the oxidation of isolated hydrocarbons including a change in the type of initiation reactions, which involved both decomposition of the hydrocarbon or attack by other radicals in the system.

Zinc stearate (0. 01 %- 4. 0 %) was added to irregular iron powder by admixing or precipitation from solution. Pressure/density relationships, determined by continuous compaction, and loose packed densities were used to show that small additions of zinc stearate reduced interparticle friction during loose packing and at low compaction pressures. Large additions decreased particle/die-wall friction during compaction and ejection but also caused compaction inhibition. Transverse rupture strengths were determined on compacts containing various stearate based lubricants and {{it was found that}} green strength was reduced by the interposition of a thin lubricant layer within inter~particle contacts. Only materials much finer than the iron powder respectively) were able to form such layers. Investigations were undertaken to determine the effect of the decomposition of these lubricants on the development of mechanical properties in dewaxed or sintered compacts. Physical and chemical influences on tensile strength were observed. Decomposition of lubricants was associated with reductions of strength caused by the physical effects of pressure increases and removal of lubricant from interparticle contacts. There were also chemical effects associated with the influence of gaseous decomposition products and solid residues on sintering mechanisms. Thermogravimetry was used to study the decomposition behaviour of various lubricants as free compounds and within compacts.

40|$|Purpose: This article {{discusses}} the electrochemical method of directional conversion of carboxylic acids, {{which are the}} most aggressive hydrocarbons oxidation products back into the corresponding hydrocarbons. Existing methods for the regeneration of waste petroleum oils have significant drawbacks, which include the formation of new hard-reclaimed waste and loss of {{a significant part of}} the oil during regeneration. Methods: Electrooxidation processes of carboxylic acid on various electrode materials: platinum, graphite and shungite anodes were studied. Results: Potentiostatic polarization curves with simultaneous measurement of near-electrode solution pH showed differences in the process on these anode materials: dimer yield for Kolbe is decreased under the transition from platinum to shungite. At potentials higher than 2. 0 v, carboxylic acid has a higher adsorbability compared to water. Therefore Faraday’s side-process of water oxidation doesn’t almost occur, which contributes to high yield of expected product according to current. Electrolysis of carboxylic acids solutions under controlled potential (2. 0 and 2. 4 V) and chromatographic analysis of the formed products showed that along with the dimeric structures formation for Kolbe reaction, the occurrence of a hydrocarbons mixture takes place, which may be the result of disproportionation of hydrocarbon radicals (alkane and alkene) and hydrocarbons of isomeric structure, by further oxidation of the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>radical</b> to carbocation and its subsequent transformation into the corresponding saturated and unsaturated isomers. Such statement is not supported by conception of the process of one- and two-electron carboxylic acid oxidation. Discussion: General carboxylic acid oxidation scheme according to one-electron mechanism (dimerization and disproportionation of the radical) and two-electron mechanism (formation and carbocation rearrangement) is proposed. The formation of hydrocarbons under carboxylic acid electrooxidation of waste oils during their regeneration can promote the increase of oil yield without formation of dangerous by-products. </p...|$|E
40|$|Many of {{the largest}} scale {{industrial}} chemical processes are based on free-radical chemistry, such as polymerization processes, combustion, pyrolysis and steam cracking. For an optimal design and optimization of the chemical reactors for these processes, an accurate reactor and kinetic model is necessary. For free-radical chemistry this requires a detailed reaction network that can contain hundreds of species and thousands of elementary reactions. For every elementary reaction, thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are required. The determination of all these parameters is one {{of the largest}} challenges in kinetic modeling, and reactor simulations typically involve the use of an inconsistent mixture of experimentally determined, predicted and fitted thermodynamic and kinetic data. Therefore, in this research, a consistent set of thermodynamic and kinetic data for the gas phase radical chemistry of hydrocarbons is developed based on ab initio CBS-QB 3 quantum chemical calculations. The calculated data are in quantitative agreement with experimentally determined values. The obtained ab initio data are applied to construct group additive models for a fast prediction of the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters required in reaction networks for radical-based gas phase chemistry. The studied reaction families involve radical addition and reverse β scission, and hydrogen abstraction reactions. The constructed group additive models allow an accurate prediction of the thermochemistry of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon radicals, and the kinetics of a broad range of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>radical</b> additions and hydrogen abstractions. The application of the group additive models in the simulation of a pilot and industrial reactor for the steam cracking of ethane results in a good agreement with pilot and industrial data, with all main yields, except methane and propene, reproduced within 15 % over a range of reactor conditions. This shows that the simulation of a chemical reactor based on ab initio calculations and kinetic models only, without a single adjusted parameter or experimental value, is within the reach of the current ab initio methods.

A series of other polymers were also irradiated in a preliminary survey. Molar mass measurements are {{used to measure the}} radiationyield for chain scission G (s). Irradiation at room temperature causes significantly more chain scission than at 195 K. Additional chain scission occurs on storage following irradiation at 195 K.

Crystallisation is found to proceed with an Avrami integer n = 2. At a given crystallisation temperature, the overall crystallisation rate of irradiated polymer is less than the non-irradiated, but spherulite growth rates are identical. Thermogravimetric analysis is used to assess the thermal stability of irradiated polypropylene in nitrogen, air and oxygen.

Photoelectrons are important contributors near the F 1 peaks, and may dominate at lower altitudes, in the region where soft x-rays are absorbed. On the nightsides, ionization by primary auroral particles and secondary electrons may dominate ion production in the auroral regions of planets with intrinsic magnetic fields, such as the earth and outer planets. On Venus, the nightside ionosphere is produced mainly by transport of atomic ions to the nightside and precipitation of electrons that are observed in the umbra. The different sources of ionization are reflected in the composition of ions. Not much is known about the strength or composition of the Martian nightside ionosphere, {{but there are a few}} radio occultation measurements near the terminators, and predictions about the composition have been made...|$|R

The thermal annealing {{resulted in the}} gradual effusion of hydrogen and part of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>radicals</b> from the material due to thermal decomposition of (OCH 3) 2 C 6 H 5 groups. The decomposition of hydrocarbons inside the material and carbon precipitation after annealing at higher temperatures results {{in the formation of}} nanocomposite SiO 2 :C powder. It was found that the samples changed their color under annealing: the initial SiO 2 :C sample has a white color, while the SiO 2 :C sample annealed at 500  °C was light-brown and the SiO 2 :C samples annealed at 700 and 800  °C were dark-brown and black, respectively.|$|R
40|$|With {{the large}} {{differences}} in surface energy between film and substrate {{in combination with}} the low sticking coefficient of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>radicals,</b> nanocrystalline diamond growth on foreign substrates typically results in poor nucleation densities. A seeding technique is therefore required to realize pinhole-free and thin coalesced films. In this work, a chemical nucleation method for growth of diamond on nondiamond substrates based on 2, 2 -divinyladamantane is shown. After treating with the carbon-containing DVA, the chemically treated wafers were exposed to low-power-density plasma, known as the incubation phase, to facilitate the formation of diamond nucleation sites followed by a high-power-density growth regime to produce coalesced films. The resulting films demonstrate high crystallinity, whereas the Raman spectra suggest high-quality diamond with low sp 2 content...|$|R
