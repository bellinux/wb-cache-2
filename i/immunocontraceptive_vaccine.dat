50|$|Experiments are {{undergoing}} {{to test the}} effectiveness of an <b>immunocontraceptive</b> <b>vaccine</b> that inhibits the fusing of spermatozoa to the zona pellucida. This vaccine is currently being tested in animals and hopefully will be an effective contraceptive for humans. Normally, spermatozoa fuse with the zona pellucida surrounding the mature oocyte; the resulting acrosome reaction breaks down the egg's tough coating so that the sperm can fertilize the oovum. The mechanism of the vaccine is injection with cloned ZP cDNA, therefore this vaccine is a DNA based vaccine. This results {{in the production of}} antibodies against the ZP, which stop the sperm from binding to the zona pellucida and ultimately from fertilizing the oovum.|$|E

Two fertility control agents, an avian reproductive inhibitor containing the active ingredient nicarbazin and an <b>immunocontraceptive</b> <b>vaccine,</b> have received regulatory approval with the Environmental Protection Agency and are commercially available in the USA. OvoControl G Contraceptive Bait for Canada Geese and Ovo Control for pigeons are delivered as oral baits. An injectable <b>immunocontraceptive</b> <b>vaccine</b> (GonaCon <b>Immunocontraceptive</b> <b>Vaccine)</b> was registered with the Environmental Protection Agency for use in female white-tailed deer in September 2009. An injectable product (GonaCon <b>Immunocontraceptive</b> <b>Vaccine)</b> is registered for use in female white-tailed deer. Both products are labeled for use in urban/suburban areas where these species are overabundant. Several other compounds are currently being tested for use in wildlife in the USA, Europe, Australia and New Zealand that could have promise in the future. The development and use of reproductive inhibitors for resolving human–wildlife conflicts will depend on a number of factors, including meeting the requirements of regulatory agencies for use in the environment and on the biological and economical feasibility of their use. Use will also be dependent on health and safety issues and on public acceptance of the techniques...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to {{determine}} if early immunization against GnRH would induce a long-lasting immune response in fawns, and if it would delay or prevent sexual development. We gave primary and subsequent booster injections of a KLH-GnRH/Freund’s vaccine to 6 male and 6 female fawns. This vaccine contained the same active ingredients as GonaCon™ vaccine, but it contained Freund’s adjuvant instead of AdjuVac™ adjuvant. Two 450 -μg injections were given 1 month apart when fawns were 3 and 4 months of age. Although 1 female fawn produced a multiyear contraceptive response similar to that observed previously in vaccinated adults, the immune response lasted only 1 year in the other 11 fawns. Antibody titers in those 11 fawns declined sharply to near zero during the second and third years after vaccination.

Four cynomolgus macaques immunized with monkey or human zona pellucida 3 peptide (pZP 3) in adjuvant, developed T-cell responses to the immunizing peptide and produced antibody that bound to native zona pellucida in vivo.

The antigens tested were bone morphogenic protein 15 (BMP 15), oviduct glycoprotein (OGP) and ubiquitin-tagged mZP 3. In addition, four polyepitope constructs that contain rodent or mouse specific epitopes were tested. This study found that when expressed by an MCMV vector, only full-length mZP 3 or ubiquitin-tagged mZP 3 induced infertility in female mice. BMP 15 and OGP had no effect. Of the four polyepitopes tested, one had a partial effect on fertility. These data indicate that while MCMV is an effective vector for VVIC, the antigen used needs to be tested empirically. The partial infertility seen in mice infected with one of the polyepitope vaccines is a promising finding suggesting that {{it may be possible to}} combine a species specific virus with a species specific antigen for use as a disseminating mouse control agent...|$|R
40|$|Overpopulation of feral {{horses in}} several western states is an unquestioned problem. Current {{management}} strategies of removal and adoption are expensive, logistically challenging, and ineffective {{as a means}} of population control. We are testing three long-acting contraceptive approaches on feral Nevada mares. Modified reversible <b>immunocontraceptive</b> <b>vaccines</b> for gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and porcine zona pellucida (F 2 ̆ 7 ZP) (SpayVac), and intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs), are being evaluated to determine: I) their safety and efficacy for preventing pregnancy for multiple years, 2) whether the effects are reversible, and 3) whether there are notable contraindications. Preliminary data after 1 year suggest that IUD- and PZP-treated mares continue to exhibit breeding and estrus, while GnRH-treated mares are less likely to cycle. All mares in the GnRH and PZP treatments were infertile for the breeding season. Eighty percent of the IUD-treated mares were infertile; those mares that became pregnant likely failed to retain the IUD. A notable contraindication was that uterine edema normally observed in mares in the follicular phase of the estrous cycle was commonly observed in PZP-treated mares. Because administration of each contraceptive approach is different, and each has different effects and expected duration, one approach or a combination of approaches may be best suited for specific field applications. Subsequent years of this study should establish the efficacy and safety of one or more long-acting contraceptive approaches for feral horse population control...|$|R
