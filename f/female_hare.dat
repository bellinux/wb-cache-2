40|$|AbstractTo {{understand}} {{changes in}} the faecal flora, one has to know the physiological flora first. The aim {{of this paper is}} to give insight into the changes of the culturable faecal flora of European brown hares (Lepus europaeus) in a captive setting. Therefore faecal samples were collected from three juvenile hares as soon as possible after birth until their death, and from two adult <b>female</b> <b>hares</b> for almost one year. Samples were collected once a week and further processed as soon as possible. A routine bacteriological investigation was performed, as well as selective isolation of III. generation cephalosporin-resistant and fluoroquinolone-resistant enterobacterial isolates. The juvenile hares showed a somewhat more variable flora, the adult hares a rather stable composition. Only seldom potential pathogenic bacteria (i. e. Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens) were isolated from the adult hares. These pathogens were found after moments of stress. The more variable flora in the juveniles is seen as a result of the not yet completely developed immune system, and due to the stress of weaning. One juvenile showed a severe shift of the flora due to a severe typhlocolitis. Our results give insight into the normal faecal flora of European brown hares. These results can act as baseline information and help interpreting results gathered in a clinical setting, as well as during field work...|$|R
40|$|Estimating density, {{age and sex}} {{structure}} of wild populations is a key objective in wildlife management. Live trapping is frequently used {{to collect data on}} populations of small and medium-sized mammals. Ideally, sampling mammal populations by live capturing of individuals provides a random and representative sample of the target population. Trapping data may, however, be biased. We used live-capture data from mountain hares Lepus timidus in Scotland to assess sampling bias between two different capture methods. Wecaptured hares using baited cage traps and long nets on five study areas in the Scottish Highlands. After controlling for the effects of body size, individuals caught in traps were lighter than individuals caught using long nets, suggesting that the body condition of hares differed between the capture methods. This tendency may reflect an increased risk-taking of individuals in poorer body condition and less aversion to entering traps in order to benefit from eating bait. Overall, we caught more adult hares than juveniles and more <b>female</b> <b>hares</b> than males. Our results show that estimates of density and population structure of mountain hares using livecapture data could be affected by the capture method used. We suggest that live-capture studies employ more than one capture method and test for heterogeneity in capture probability to minimise potential bias and achieve reliable estimates of population parameters...|$|R
40|$|Two {{population}} oscillations dominate {{terrestrial community}} dynamics in northern Canada. In the boreal forest, the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) fluctuates in cycles with an 8 – 10 year periodicity and in tundra regions lemmings typically fluctuate in cycles with a 3 – 4 year periodicity. I review 60 {{years of research}} that has uncovered many {{of the causes of}} these population cycles, outline areas of controversy that remain and suggest key questions to address. Lemmings are keystone herbivores in tundra ecosystems because they are a key food resource for many avian and mammalian predators and are a major consumer of plant production. There remains much controversy over the role of predation, food shortage and social interactions in causing lemming cycles. Predation is well documented as a significant mortality factor limiting numbers. Food shortage is less likely to be a major limiting factor on population growth in lemmings. Social interactions might {{play a critical role in}} reducing the rate of population growth as lemming density rises. Snowshoe hares across the boreal forest are a key food for many predators and their cycles have been the subject of large-scale field experiments that have pinpointed predation as the key limiting factor causing these fluctuations. Predators kill hares directly and indirectly stress them by unsuccessful pursuits. Stress reduces the reproductive rate of <b>female</b> <b>hares</b> and is transmitted to their offspring who also suffer reduced reproductive rates. The maternal effects produced by predation risk induce a time lag in the response of hare reproductive rate to density, aiding the cyclic dynamics...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The trophic {{dynamics}} of the Yukon boreal forest have been under investigation at the Kluane Lake Research Station since 1973. We monitored and conducted experiments on the major species in this ecosystem, except the large mammals (for logistic reasons). The central problem has been to determine {{the causes of the}} 9 – 10 year cycle of snowshoe hares, and to achieve this we carried out several large-scale experiments manipulating food supplies, predator pressure, and soil nutrient availability to test hypotheses that food, predation, or habitat quality regulate populations. The hare cycle is driven top-down by predators, and most hares die because they are killed by predators. Predators also cause stress in <b>female</b> <b>hares,</b> and the stress response seems to be responsible for the loss of reproductive potential in the decline and low phases of the hare cycle. Many of the specialist predators and some herbivores in this ecosystem fluctuate with the hare cycle. Arctic ground squirrels do, but red squirrels do not, being linked closely to white spruce seed masting years. Small rodents fluctuate in numbers in two patterns. Red-backed voles and four species of Microtus voles have a 3 – 4 year cycle that seems to be driven by food supplies and social behaviour. Deer mice, in contrast, have fluctuated dramatically in the 38 years we have monitored them, but not cyclically. White spruce seed production varies with temperature and rainfall, but was not affected by adding nutrients in fertilizer. Global warming and reduced hare browsing in the last 20 years have helped to increase the abundance of shrubs in these forests. It will be challenging to predict how this system will change as climatic warming proceeds, because even closely related species in the same trophic level respond differently to perturbations. We recommend continued monitoring of th...|$|R

This {{research}} {{attempts to}} determine how gifts of individual believers can enrich the respective gender roles in church and society. Some Pauline writings were studied, {{and in addition to}} Romans 123 - 8, exegesis is also done on other passages (1 Corinthians 121 - 31 and Ephesians 4 : 4 - 16) dealing with the 'body of Christ" (gifts). An exegesis on passages concerning the role of women (gender) (1 Corinthians 11 : 3 - 16, Ephesians 521 - 33, 1 Corinthians 14 : 33 b- 35, I Timothy 28 - 15 and Romans 1631 - 16) in church and marriage follows. By doing this, biblical guidelines are found on how men and women should exercise their gifts in the church. Galatians 328 is found to form the basis for all Pauline writings. Here Paul puts the given fact that "in Christ Jesus" male and <b>female</b> <b>'are</b> one" and therefore equal before God. There still remains a created difference between male and female. Turning to gifts, men and women have equal access to all gifts, but {{the way in which they}} exercise the gifts may have certain nuances. This research attempts to correct the old practice by using Zerfass's method of putting the basis theoretical perspectives into interaction with meta-theoretical perspectives, so that a new practice is developed. This means that a study of other relevant sciences (i. e. Psychology, Sociology, Law, Feminism I Feminist Theology) concerning gifts and gender had to be done. Supplementing this with an empirical study, it is determined how gifts are used among the genders in daily practice. In this way the real experiences of men and women in church are reflected. The research comes to a close when pastoral consequences are drawn, and a strategy for churches is proposed. The finding is that both men and women should take part in the offices of the church, because they are on an equal footing with one another. Doctora...|$|R

The second litter {{can therefore be}} conceived before the first litter is born (snowshoe hares have twin uteri). Pregnancy rates ranged from 78 to 100% for females {{during the period of}} first litter production, 82 to 100% for second litters, and for the periods of third and fourth litters pregnancy rates vary with population cycle. In Newfoundland, the average number of litters per female per year ranged from 2.9 to 3.5, and in Alberta the range was from 2.7 to 3.3. The number of litters per year varies with phase of population cycle (see below). In Alberta the average number of litters per year was almost 3 just after a population peak and 4 just after the population low. Females normally first breed as 1-year-olds. Juvenile breeding is rare and has only been observed in females from the first litter of the year and only in years immediately following a low point in the population cycle.|$|R
40|$|Microsatellite {{analysis}} of multiple paternity and male reproductive {{success in the}} promiscuous snowshoe hare Cole Burton Abstract: Few genetic studies have addressed patterns of paternity in promiscuous mammals. I used microsatellite DNA primers developed in the European rabbit to analyze paternity in the promiscuous snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus). Sixty-five offspring, their 12 mothers, and their 24 putative fathers were genotyped at seven polymorphic loci (3 – 22 alleles/locus). Paternal allele counts and likelihood-based paternity assignments confirmed that multiple pa-ternity occurs in snowshoe hare litters. However, the estimated frequency of multiple paternity was lower than expected in an unstructured promiscuous mating system. A relatively low variance in male reproductive success indicated that no males dominated paternity. A few males did achieve significantly more paternities than average, largely by fathering one or two complete litters rather than a few offspring in many litters. The results suggest that successful multiple mat-ing is limited among both male and <b>female</b> snowshoe <b>hares.</b> An important role for pre- and (or) post-copulatory com-petition is implied.

40|$|The {{concept of}} superfetation, a second {{conception}} during pregnancy, has been controversial {{for a long}} time. In this paper we use an experimental approach to demonstrate that <b>female</b> European brown <b>hares</b> (Lepus europaeus) frequently develop a second pregnancy while already pregnant and thereby increase their reproductive success. After a new, successful copulation, we confirmed additional ovulations before parturition in living, late-pregnant females by detecting {{a second set of}} fresh corpora lutea using high-resolution ultrasonography. The presence of early embryonic stages in the oviduct, demonstrated by oviduct flushing, next to fully developed fetuses in the uterus is best explained by passage of semen through the late-pregnant uterus; this was confirmed by paternity analysis using microsatellite profiling. Subsequent implantation occurred after parturition. This superfetation, categorized as superconception, significantly increased litter size and permitted females to produce up to 35. 4 % more offspring per breeding season. It is therefore most likely an evolutionary adaptation...|$|R
40|$|The applied {{methods in}} this {{long-term}} study provided reliable data on reproductive performance of Ebh. The {{aim of this}} study was to elucidate whether disrupted fertility was responsible for the decline of Ebh in different habitats in North Rhine-Westphalia. Infertility or subfertility were discussed as a potential cause for population decline. A total number of 375 free-living Ebh, 178 females and 197 males, of 15 different habitats were caught and assessed under general anaesthesia. The applied methods included the evaluation of morphometrical, sonographical, spermatological and endocrinological parameters. The special catching technique in combination with inhalation anaesthesia and non-surgical examination provided, for the first time, the possibility to assess reproductive parameters in free-living hares during close season. In comparison with post-mortem studies, much more information was able without diminishing number of hares. The specific design of the examination protocol in this study allowed the acquisition of reproductive parameters for the detection of reduced fertility (BLOTTNER, 2001; modified and completed after MATTISON, 1989). The study periods included the main breeding season (February and April) and the period of reduced sexual activity (July). Post-mortem examinations in situ and ex situ provided the schematic illustration of the anatomy and topography of the entire urogenital tract. This information was not available until now and was essential for the interpretation of ultrasonographical findings. Based on the results of the general examination, no reduced body condition was detected. The results suggested a seasonal influence, but there were no indications of any pathological changes of the gonads of <b>female</b> <b>hares.</b> A total amount of 83, 15 % of the animals were reproductively active. The mean pregnancy rate of 67, 98 % did not indicate an impairment of reproductive performance. Especially in July, a smaller portion of non-pregnant animals was elevated by a higher portion of lactating animals. In the group of non-pregnant and non-lactating animals, the ultrasonographical findings of the ovaries (including functional structures like follicles and corpora lutea) and the hormonal levels of P 4 (15, 9 + 4, 7 ng / ml) and E 2 (0, 07 + 0, 01 ng / ml) indicated physiological sexual activity in the main breeding season. Mean number of foetuses (1, 9 + 0, 1) per pregnancy was smaller than in literature reported. This does not correlate necessarily with reproductive failure, because the ultrasonographical imaging of foetal integrity and vitality (prevalence of embryonic or foetal death 8, 26 %) did not result in any disturbance. In particular, the number of females with reproductive pathology (2, 25 %) was very low. The results showed a significant seasonal influence on testicular size and mean volume that was lower than in other studies, but ultrasonographical findings did not show any general or habitat-dependent disturbance of gonadal activity. Pathological alterations on testis found in one case were of traumatic origin. Additionally, seasonal influence showed significant differences in sperm production. Mating activity in the field was not observed in this project. Time studies to determine the amount of time needed for sperm quantity and quality to return post mating should follow. The high percentages of motile and intact spermatozoa demonstrated an unimpaired reproductive performance. In some males with low ejaculate and/or sperm quantity, the analysis of testicular tissue (fine needle biopsy) did not show any disturbances of spermatogenesis. The variability of reproductive parameters between the individuals did not show any relationship to the different habitat types. First, low testosterone concentrations (in April: 0, 32 + 0, 02 ng / ml) suggested a disturbance of reproduction, but no relation between androgen production and habitats and high or low hare population density was detected. The applied methods were suitable to detect reproductive failures and provided much more information than post - mortem studies. Until now no influence of habitat type could be found. Further examinations should occur on a larger number of animals. On the basis of these results, future studies could be performed on stability or changes of reproductive performance over an extended time period. In conclusion, the results suggested that the decline in Ebh populations is a result of a reduced survival rate rather than by a disturbed fertility...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{relation}} between physical condition, measured as the Kidney Fat Index (KFI), and some reproductive parameters of Lepus granatensis in Navarra province, Spain. Samples were collected between October 2001 and January 2003, totaling 174 hares (87 males and 87 <b>females).</b> All the <b>hares</b> were sexed and classified in three age categories (immature, young and adult). Fertile males and females were present in all monthly samples. Kidney weight was greater in females than in males for all the age classes and kidney weight variation along the year was not significant. Ranges of perirenal fat accumulated were larger in females but mean weight of fat for all hares was similar in males and females. Body weight and kidney fat weight was directly related both for males and females. Global pattern of fat deposition along the year was similar for both sexes. The amount of perirenal fat in adult fertile hares reaches maximum values just before the main reproduction period and reproductive state conditioned kidney fat levels. Pregnancy induces fat deposition in females and factors such as the number of embryos and the stage of gestation influence kidney fat levels.

40|$|Materials and methods. 110 hares (55 {{males and}} 55 females) with an age between 140 to 800 days, {{have been used}} for our study between year 2002 and 2006. Ten of the hares were {{observed}} with the help of video-surveillance and the rest were observed directly by an operator. Pairs of animals were placed in experimental cage (200 cm of length x 100 of width x 120 of height) closed in a fenced area of minimum 100 square meters provided with spontaneous or sown vegetation. After a period of adaptation in the cage the hares were given the opportunity of leaving the cage. A little door to the back wall of the cage was connected with a step ramp to allow escaping. Time of escape from the cage was recorded for each animal. Data were analyzed with Variance Analysis (SAS System, 2000) and results are tested for gender (male vs female) and age (old vs adult vs young). Results. The average time of escape resulted 14. 23 ± 11. 24 days. Gender differences are statistically marked and the escaping time is longer for the females (15 ± 7 vs 12 ± 7; P≤ 0. 001). In all the categories of age females need more time before leaving the cage: old (13 vs 20; P≤ 0. 01); adult (13 vs 16; P≤ 0. 01); young (11 vs 13; N. S.). For young animals it takes an average time of 12 days to leave the cage towards the fenced area compared with old animals that stayed hidden in the cage for 16. 50 days before living it. Adult hares show average values (14. 50 days) between the values for old and young animals. All the escaping times recorded among the categories of age appear statistically different (16. 50 vs 14. 50 vs 12. 00; P< 0. 01). Discussion. The innovation of the proposed system is based on the opportunity given to the animals of spontaneously leaving the cage for the fenced area. The proposed system appears to conflict totally with the usual techniques used in Italy during the normal repopulation operations. Data of this study emphasize male's tendency to leave the cage earlier than the more fearful females in all the categories of age. None of the animals leaved spontaneously the cage earlier than ten days. An average time of 15 days is needed before the animals recognize the ideal conditions of quiet required to go out of the cage. When the animals decide to occupy the fenced area the second step is finished positively and it's possible to start the third. Unfortunately the time needed to obtain good survival rate results is too long and doesn't match the needs of extremely limited time of the entities in charge of the fauna management (Province Administrations; territorial hunting authorities). This management's team have to complete in one day the repopulation operations in 5 - 10 localities far from each other. The results of our experimental trial show that the hares need a long time of acclimatization in every changed phase. An average of 10 days must be considered the minimum time of acclimatization to ensure a good results after the release in natural conditions. Conclusion. Obtained results permit to resume the following conclusions: a. European hare confirms her shy behaviour, typical characteristic of the prey. b. The cage that had housed the animals in captivity is initially considered to be a safer hideout, compared with the offer of freedom. c. It's needed a long time before the subjects, after observing all the movements and components, find the courage to leave the cage for the fenced area. d. It takes a shorter time for young animals to leave the cage. This fact encourages choosing young subjects for the repopulation operations, apart from the gender. e. The little difference between male and <b>female</b> young <b>hares</b> suggests that both the gender can be used to repopulate.
