25|$|The {{intensity}} of medical management {{is dependent on}} the severity of the colic, its cause, and the financial capabilities of the owner. At the most basic level, analgesia and sedation is administered to the horse. The most commonly used analgesics for colic pain in horses are NSAIDs, such as <b>flunixin</b> meglumine, although opioids such as butorphanol may be used if the pain is more severe. Butrophanol is often given with alpha-2 agonists such as xylazine and detomidine to prolong the analgesic effects of the opioid. Early colic signs may be masked with the use of NSAIDs, so some practitioners prefer to examine the horse before they are given by the owner.|$|E
25|$|Fluid {{support is}} {{essential}} to maintain blood pressure, often {{with the help of}} colloids or hypertonic saline. NSAIDs are commonly given to reduce systemic inflammation. However, they decrease the levels of certain prostaglandins that normally promote healing of the intestinal mucosa, which subsequently increases the amount of endotoxin absorbed. To counteract this, NSAIDs are sometimes administered with a lidocaine drip, which appears to reduce this particular negative effect. <b>Flunixin</b> may be used for this purpose at a dose lower than that used for analgesia, so can be safely given to a colicky horse without risking masking signs that the horse requires surgery. Other drugs that bind endotoxin, such as polymyxin B and Bio-Sponge, are also often used. Polymixin B prevents endotoxin from binding to inflammatory cells, but is potentially nephrotoxic, so should be used with caution in horses with azotemia, especially neonatal foals. Plasma may also be given with the intent of neutralizing endotoxin.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of adhesions {{begins with}} good {{surgical}} technique to minimize {{trauma to the}} tissue and thus reparative responses by the body. Several drugs and substances are {{used to try to}} prevent adhesion formation. Preoperative use of DMSO, a free radical scavenger, potassium penicillin, and <b>flunixin</b> meglumine may be given. The thick intestinal lubricant carboxymethylcellulose is often applied to the GI tract intraoperatively, to decrease trauma from handling by the surgeon and provide a physical barrier between the intestine and adjacent intestinal loops or abdominal organs. It has been shown to double the survival rate of horses, and its use is now a standard practice. Hyaluraonan {{can also be used to}} produce a physical barrier. Intraperitoneal unfractionated heparin is sometimes used, since it decreases fibrin formation and thus may decrease fibrinous adhesions. Omentectomy (removal of the omentum) is a quick, simple procedure that also greatly decreases the risk of adhesions, since the omentum is one organ that commonly adheres to the intestines. The abdomen is usually lavaged copiously before the abdomen is sutured closed, and anti-inflammatories are given postoperatively. A laparoscope may be used post-surgery to look for and break down adhesions, however there is risk of additional adhesions forming post-procedure. Encouraging motility post-surgery can also be useful, as it decreases the contact time between tissues. Adhesion-induced colic has a poor prognosis, with a 16% survival rate in one study.|$|E

50|$|<b>Flunixin</b> is {{administered}} at {{a dose of}} 1.1 mg/kg. The full analgesic and antipyretic effects usually occur 1-2 hours following treatment, but there is often an effective analgesic effect within approximately 15 minutes. Despite its short plasma half life of 1.6-2.5 hours, effects can persist for up to 30 hours, with maximal effects occurring between 2 and 16 hours. This is likely due to accumulation of the drug at inflammatory foci. <b>Flunixin</b> is primarily eliminated by the kidneys.|$|E
50|$|Norbrook {{manufactures}} several pharmaceutical drugs, {{the most}} well-known of which are the antibiotic drugs Noroclav and Betamox, NSAIDs such as Carprieve, Loxicom and <b>Flunixin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Flunixin</b> {{is labeled}} {{for no more}} than 5 days of {{consecutive}} use and prolonged use increases the risk of toxicity. In horses, this includes gastric ulcers, right dorsal colitis, and nephrotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|Because it targets the {{inflamed}} tissue, <b>flunixin</b> {{is mainly}} used for colic pain, musculoskeletal pain, and ocular pain. It {{is also used}} as an antipyretic and to reduce the effects of endotoxemia.|$|E
50|$|In the US, {{the only}} labeled route for <b>flunixin</b> {{administration}} in cattle is intravenous. This {{is not the}} case in other countries; for example, in the UK, Allevenix is licensed for IV and intramuscular use, and a pour-on product also exists.|$|E
5000|$|Several NSAIDs {{have been}} found to be harmful to {{scavenging}} birds. Diclofenac, carprofen, <b>flunixin,</b> ibuprofen and phenylbutazone were associated with mortality. Meloxicam has thus far been found to be [...] "Vulture-Safe" [...] and its use in veterinary treatment of livestock is being encouraged.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flunixin</b> may {{be given}} orally as a paste or as {{granules}} in feed. It {{can also be used}} intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV). However, it is very irritating to tissue and IM administration has been associated with myonecrosis in horses, so IV administration is preferred.|$|E
50|$|Anti-inflammatories {{are always}} used when {{treating}} acute case of laminitis, and include Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS), DMSO, pentoxpfylline, and cryotherapy. For analgesia, NSAIDs {{are often the}} first line of defense. Phenylbutazone is commonly used for its strong effect and relatively low cost. <b>Flunixin</b> (Banamine), ketofen, and others are also used. Nonspecific NSAIDs such as suxibuzone, or COX-2-specific drugs, such as firocoxib and diclofenac, may be somewhat safer than phenylbutazone in preventing NSAID toxicity such as right dorsal colitis, gastric ulcers, and kidney damage. However, firocoxib provides less pain relief than phenylbutazone or <b>flunixin.</b> Care must be taken that pain isn't totally eliminated, since this will encourage the horse to stand and move around, which increases mechanical separation of the laminae.|$|E
50|$|For example, ketoprofen's {{effects have}} been studied in horses more than in {{ruminants}} but, due to controversy over its use in racehorses, veterinarians who treat livestock in the United States more commonly prescribe <b>flunixin</b> meglumine, which, while labeled for use in such animals, is not indicated for post-operative pain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flunixin</b> is a {{prohibited}} substance under International Federation for Equestrian Sports rules, {{and its use}} {{is prohibited}} or restricted by many other equestrian organizations. At labeled dose (1.1 mg/kg) given IV, detection time {{was found to be}} 144 hours. However, drug recycling from bedding contamination by treated horses has been shown to potentially increase the clearance time.|$|E
50|$|During {{an acute}} flare-up, therapy is {{targeted}} at reducing the inflammation present, and dilating the pupil. Mydriasis is important, as pupillary constriction {{is the primary}} reason for pain. Anti-inflammatory therapy is usually given both systemically, often in the form of <b>flunixin</b> meglumine, and topically, as prednisolone acetate. The mydriatic of choice is atropine. In the periods between acute attacks, no therapy {{has been shown to be}} beneficial.|$|E
50|$|Supportive {{care for}} severe cases {{is aimed at}} {{minimizing}} the effects of endotoxemia and preventing laminitis. This may include intravenous fluids and electrolytes to counteract the diarrhea; NSAIDs such as Banamine (<b>flunixin</b> meglumine); intravenous dimethyl sulfoxide; administration of products such as Biosponge or activated charcoal via nasogastric tube to bind endotoxins; polymyxin B or plasma for endotoxemia; supportive shoeing; low doses of intramuscular acepromazine; and pentoxifylline.|$|E
50|$|Carprofen may be {{administered}} intravenously to horses. A single dose {{has been shown}} to reduce prostaglandin E2 production and inflammatory exudate for up to 15 hours, although there was less effect on eicosanoid production when compared to the effects produced by NSAIDs such as phenylbutazone or <b>flunixin.</b> Prostaglandin E2 and inflammatory exudate are also reduced and leukotriene B4 is inhibited. Carprofen can also be given orally, but intramuscular use may produce muscle damage.|$|E
50|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) are {{a mainstay}} of lameness treatment, providing analgesia (pain relief) and reducing inflammation. The term NSAID is {{used to refer to}} a specific drug class that inhibits the conversion of arachadonic acid into prostaglandins and thromboxane. Reduction of prostaglandin helps to reduce pain, decrease vasodilation (and subsequent edema formation), and the diminish the effects of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1. The most commonly used NSAIDs in the United States is phenylbutazone, although <b>flunixin</b> meglumine and firocoxib are also commonly used for orthopedic pain.|$|E
50|$|Treatment usually {{involves}} {{high doses of}} steroids such as dexamethasone. While high doses of steroids may risk laminitis, low doses are associated with refractory cases. Antibiotics are used to treat any residual nidus of S. equi. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as phenylbutazone or <b>flunixin,</b> {{may be useful to}} reduce fever and relieve pain. Intravenous DMSO is sometimes used as a free-radical scavenger and anti-inflammatory. Additionally, wrapping the legs may reduce edema and skin sloughing. Supportive care with oral or IV fluids may also be required.|$|E

50|$|The mainstays of {{treatment}} are {{the administration of}} broad-spectrum antibiotics (typically potentiated sulfonamides or penicillin and streptomycin, but doxycycline {{may be the most}} effective). If possible, microbial culture and sensitivity testing should be performed, so the most efficacious antibiotic can be chosen. However, intracellular organisms such as Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis will be susceptible to certain antibiotics in vitro that are not effective for the specific organism in the horse. These horses are typically treated with rifampin in addition to one of the previously mentioned antibiotics. In addition, anti-inflammatories are important, to reduce the swelling and pain of the inflammatory response. NSAIDs are commonly used (<b>flunixin</b> is the drug of choice, but phenylbutazone may also be used). Corticosteroids are sometimes used in severe cases, but should be used with caution due to their potential to weaken the immune response to infection, and the possibility of inducing laminitis.|$|E

5000|$|Treatment for colitis-X {{usually does}} not save the horse. The {{prognosis}} is average to poor, and mortality is 90% to 100%. [...] However, treatments are available, and one famous horse that survived colitis-X was U.S. Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew, that survived colitis-X in 1978 {{and went on}} to race as a four-year-old.Large amounts of intravenous fluids are needed to counter the severe dehydration, and electrolyte replacement is often necessary. <b>Flunixin</b> meglumine (Banamine) may help block the effects of toxemia. Mortality rate has been theorized to fall to 75% if treatment is prompt and aggressive, including administration of not only fluids and electrolytes, but also blood plasma, anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs, and antibiotics. Preventing dehydration is extremely important. Nutrition is also important. Either parenteral or normal feeding can be used to support the stressed metabolism of the sick horse. Finally, the use of probiotics is considered beneficial in the restoration of the normal intestinal flora.
