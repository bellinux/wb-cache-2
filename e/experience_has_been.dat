The bridge night lighting is now glare free and new white LED lighting has been installed in the lower, eastbound tunnel section.

25|$|The Oakland Touchdown is {{a curved}} {{elevated}} roadway {{that connects the}} skyway to the Oakland shore (the beginning of the bridge). The curve is required to bring the alignment {{to that of the}} existing ground-level approach road. Like the Yerba Buena Island Transition Structure (YBITS) {{to the west of the}} main span, this section is also an end segment of the new bridge and is being constructed at the same pace as the YBITS. The construction process consists of two phases, the first phase already completed (westbound traffic side). The eastbound touchdown could not be completed until the existing roadway was out of the way. This was done by constructing a gentle swing to the south so that the touchdown may be completed. The first stage of this work was to move the eastbound traffic to the south was completed with only minor traffic delays during the 2011 Memorial Day holiday (May 28–30). The driving <b>experience</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> improved, without the problems that came with the infamous S-curve. A second stage to move the westbound traffic into the space made available required the construction of an elevated approach. This was completed on February 19, 2012. This recently designed procedure is expected to save time in the total effort, speeding the completion of the span. The Oakland Touchdown was completed in March 2013.|$|E

500|$|He {{conceived}} it in 2001 and NBC ordered 13 episodes {{the following}} year; the show's original pilot used a single-camera setup but NBC executives {{felt it would}} have more appeal as a multiple-camera setup, so it was re-shot. Appel noted of the show: [...] "There's a sense sometimes in Hollywood that writers and producers who come from animated shows maybe have something to prove to justify their credibility as live-action show-runners or writers. My own <b>experience</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> fortunate. I haven't felt that. But I know it exists."

500|$|Regarding if {{they would}} break the fifth season into pods again as with season four, Bell said, [...] "A 22-episode arc is a lot for people to hold onto.

[...] Whedon also noted it would depend on how the season would be [...] "broken up in terms of airing. If everything is running back-to-back, it feels weird to start calling it different things... We will try to have it in bite-sized chunks." [...] The season will begin airing its episodes on December 1, 2017, once Inhumans has aired its eight episodes, with the intent for all 22 episodes to air mostly uninterrupted.|$|E

500|$|George Călinescu also {{assessed}} {{that these}} literary connections served {{to highlight the}} elevated nature of Creangă's style, his [...] "erudite device", concluding: [...] "Writers such as Creangă can only show up in places where the word is ancient and equivocal, and where <b>experience</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> condensed into unchanging formulas. It {{would have been more}} natural for such a prose writer to have emerged a few centuries later, into an era of Romanian humanism. Born much earlier, Creangă showed up where there exists an ancient tradition, and therefore a species of erudition,... in a mountain village... where the people is unmixed and keeping [...]" [...] Outlining his own theory about the aspects of [...] "national specificity" [...] in Romanian letters, he expanded on these thoughts, listing Creangă and Eminescu as [...] "core Romanians" [...] who illustrated a [...] "primordial note", complemented by the [...] "southern" [...] and [...] "Balkan" [...] group of Caragiale and others. Claiming that the [...] "core" [...] presence had [...] "not primitive, but ancient" [...] origins, perpetuated by [...] "stereotyped wisdom" [...] and [...] "energetic fatalism", he asserted: [...] "Creangă shows our civilization's contemporaneity with the world's oldest civilizations, our Asian age." [...] The alternating national and regional characteristics in Creangă's writings are related by historian Neagu Djuvara with the writer's place of birth, an affluent village in an isolated region, contrasting heavily with the 19th century Wallachian countryside: [...] "if the mud hut villages of the Danube flood plain are to be taken into account, one finds himself in a different country." [...] Ornea, who noted that Eminescu effectively shared Creangă's worldview, believed the latter to have been dominated by nostalgia for a world of independent landowning peasants, and argued that Creangă's literary and political outlook were both essentially conservative. Ornea commented: [...] "One could say that it was through [...] that the writer debuted and that, within the space of his work it became, in its own right, an expression of the world that was about to vanish." [...] Commenting on Creangă's [...] "robust realism" [...] and lack of [...] "sentimentality", Vianu contrarily asserted: [...] "Creangă's nostalgia... has an individual, not social, sense." ...|$|E
