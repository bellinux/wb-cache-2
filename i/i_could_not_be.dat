5|$|This {{was by far}} {{the biggest}} {{challenge}} I have ever taken on in my career, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> more honored {{to be a part of}} such an amazing and historical event. Nothing could ever come close to working with Madonna on this Super Bowl performance, her attention to detail and commitment to all of her projects is truly inspiring and life changing.|$|E
5|$|I {{asked him}} not {{to go into that}} field, that you were going there. He laughed at the idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E
25|$|The British {{were quick}} {{to accept the fact}} that the nationalistic movement, which had {{hardened}} during World War <b>I,</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> faced without the deployment of consistent and well-trained forces. On June 25 the Kuva-i Inzibatiye was dismantled on the advice of the British, as they were becoming a liability.|$|E

25|$|This is {{the finest}} team of Sailors I've been {{fortunate}} to call shipmates. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> more proud {{of each and}} every Sailor and their families. The Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group has been pretty busy the last few years, executing missions across the capabilities of our National Maritime Strategy—and answering the call with impressive results every time.|$|E
25|$|If {{somebody}} kept a {{very accurate}} {{record of a}} human being, going through the era from the Gay 90s, from {{a very different kind}} of world through the turn of the century—as far into the twentieth century as you might live. I decided to make myself a good case history of such a human being and it meant that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> judge of what was valid to put in or not. I must put everything in, so I started a very rigorous record.|$|E
500|$|Patton was unopposed in the Democratic primary. Republicans {{nominated}} Peppy Martin, who many {{considered a}} weak candidate. In fact, Patton's old Republican foe, David Williams, {{announced he would}} vote for Patton over Martin. In the general election Patton garnered 352,099votes, 60.6percent of the total. Martin finished with 128,788votes, with 88,930votes going to third-party candidate Gatewood Galbraith. When asked why the Republicans had chosen such a weak challenger, Patton opined [...] "They mistakenly believed <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> beaten. They made a mistake." ...|$|E

500|$|During the Interregnum, {{the castle}} {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a prison. Charles <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> housed in the castle while en route to his imprisonment by Parliament at Carisbrooke Castle in 1647 because the facility was full, and he stayed at a local alehouse instead. The Royalist Sir William Davenant was imprisoned in Cowes during 1650, writing the poem Gondibert while incarcerated. As with East Cowes Castle, coastal erosion proved a particular problem for the fortification. An inspection in 1692 reported that the walls were cracked and at risk of collapse, and the antiquarian Francis Grose observed in 1785 that the castle was [...] "strongly fenced with piles and planks" [...] to prevent erosion from the sea.|$|E
500|$|Harington was {{nominated}} for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for the role in 2016. He said, [...] "It is a serious understatement to say that I am somewhat stunned ... For my work on Game of Thrones to be recognized in this way is an emotional moment for me. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> more humbled." [...] Harington was also nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television for the role in 2012, 2016, and 2017. His other nominations include the Golden Nymph Award for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series in 2012, the Young Hollywood Award for Actor of the Year in 2013, and the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2016. IGN also nominated Jon Snow as its Best TV Hero in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Dickinson {{was troubled}} {{from a young}} age by the [...] "deepening menace" [...] of death, {{especially}} the deaths {{of those who were}} close to her. When Sophia Holland, her second cousin and a close friend, grew ill from typhus and died in April 1844, Emily was traumatized. Recalling the incident two years later, Emily wrote that [...] "it seemed to me I should die too if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> permitted to watch over her or even look at her face." [...] She became so melancholic that her parents sent her to stay with family in Boston to recover. With her health and spirits restored, she soon returned to Amherst Academy to continue her studies. During this period, she first met people who were to become lifelong friends and correspondents, such as Abiah Root, Abby Wood, Jane Humphrey, and Susan Huntington Gilbert (who later married Emily's brother Austin).|$|E

500|$|As {{the series}} progressed, th character's {{popularity}} soared and Ramirez garnered widespread recognition and critical acclaim for her {{portrayal of a}} complex character on television. Reviewing the performances of Ramirez and Jessica Capshaw an episode of the eleventh season, Maggie Fremont of Vulture called them, [...] "goddesses walking amongst mere mortals". Rhimes wrote of Ramirez's work on the show: [...] "Dr. Callie Torres came into our lives dancing it out in her underwear almost a decade ago, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> happier or more proud of her journey. Sara Ramirez’s performance inspired me as well as millions of fans each week." [...] Ramirez was nominated for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Television Series at the Alma Awards, in 2007 and 2008. Also in 2007, at the 13th Screen Actors Guild Awards, the cast of Grey's Anatomy, were the recipients of the Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. She and the cast were nominated for the same award, in 2008. In 2011, at the 42nd NAACP Image Awards, Ramirez was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.|$|E
2500|$|After the Soviet Union {{broke apart}} in the early 1990s, Leningrad reverted to its {{original}} name of Saint Petersburg, and a private delegation visited Ilyinsky while he served on Palm Beach City Council {{to ask him to}} return to Russia to claim the throne as tsar.

[...] In 2017, Harington became one of the highest paid actors on television and earned £2 million per episode of Game of Thrones (based on shared percentages of syndication payments).|$|E
60|$|This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> very {{pleasant}} for me, just starting for an unknown place {{to meet an}} unknown man. But everyone seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> but <b>be</b> touched.|$|R
60|$|I met {{her eyes}} fixed upon {{me with a}} {{peculiar}} intentness. I tried to escape them, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> It <b>was</b> {{impossible for me to}} lie to her. My voice shook as I answered her.|$|R

2500|$|Taken by {{surprise}} the Indians fled. Strahorn recalled, [...] "As usual, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> denied {{the thrill of}} the charge of the by the gallant twenty-five, and I’m sure that everything worked out as planned, except that many of the Indians escaped into a thicket {{in the bottom of a}} narrow gulch running along within a few yards of the nearest tepee, while a few others got away into the hills. The Indians, finding themselves laced in their lodges, the leather drawn tight as a drum in the heavy rain, quickly cut themselves out with their knives and returned fire. [...] Many were seen to fall, and even in the approaching daylight it was often tell whether the burdens carried were children or the slain and wounded. [...] The squaws carried the dead, wounded and children up the opposite bluffs, leaving everything but their limited nightclothes in our possession. Most of the Indians fled splashing through the swollen creek and scrabbling into the heavy underbrush south of the stream bed and up the adjacent bluffs, taking advantage of Mill’s failure to secure an effective cordon southwest of the tipis.|$|E

60|$|I {{replied that}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> He <b>was</b> {{sure that he}} could, and he seemed uneasy till he had {{justified}} the sensation. So he arose, very leisurely, and went along the bank, looking closely for the flowers.|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} noticing afterwards that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> long asleep. When I {{began to}} dream I {{had only just}} blown out the candle, and when I awoke again {{there was still a}} smouldering spark upon its wick.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> so {{effective}} in taking care that some measure be proposed worthy of support as I may possibly be now. I thought {{a good deal}} about it, and I believe that my decision was right." ...|$|R
