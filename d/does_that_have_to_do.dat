And I wasn’t paying much attention to that conversation, it was a little too heavy for me at the time.

The bass player looked at my left hand for the bass line, and he learned that. Little by little, the audience was getting up from their tables, and they all got on the dance floor. Pretty soon the dance floor was filled with people, laughing and shrieking, and was having a great time, and they were saying, ‘This is a hit! This is fantastic!’ It was like a movie! So after that, Mongo said ‘Can I record this?’ I said ‘By all means.’ And he recorded it, and it became a big hit. That’s how it happened” (2001: 54).|$|E

WordNet supports both of these functions and thus deserves careful study by the digital library community.

Collingwood offers a useful account of the role of art in general in relation to life, in holding that art serves as a vehicle for the clarification of feeling and the overcoming of corrupt consciousness. But he says little about exactly how this work of clarification is done in words by means of poetic figuration. G. W. F. Hegel’s account of literary imagination focuses primarily on poetic fig-uration as it is embodied in lyric poetry. By tracing the work of poetic imagination in lyric, where that work is foregrounded in relation to actual experience (though poetic imagination is also presentwithin themaking of all works of art),Hegel helps us to see both how poetic imagination in general works in relation to feeling in al...|$|E

40|$|Australia’s refugee {{policies}} are expensive {{in the short}} term and damage our economic prospects in the long term, says Stephen Bartos THE debate about refugees who try to come to Australia by boat is usually couched in terms of big concepts like morals, ethics, rights and sovereignty. For a few minutes let us instead take a cold, hard economic look at the issue. We know that one of the biggest economic problems we face in future is aging of the population. The government’s own Intergenerational Report warns of the dangers of the present generation of taxpayers imposing a heavy cost burden on the next. It argues that policies need to be “adjusted” by $ 87 billion by 2041. That is based though on overseas migration staying constant at around current levels. In its appendix an increased migration scenario results in “a decline in the aged to working-age ratio over the next four decades and a 10 per cent increase in GDP by 2041 - 42 ”. Taking out the jargon, increased migration to Australia will help ease the economic costs of aging. But by 2040 we will be in competition with many other countries for people to come here. Australia is still a relatively young country, and others face the aging problem sooner than us. They too will seek to encourage more migration. Around the world we see governments with aging populations already starting to think this way. What <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with refugees? Well, one obvious factor that influences a country’s competitiveness in attracting migrants is whether that country is perceived as wanting them. What signals do our current approach to interception and mandatory detention send? Precisely the opposite. “We will decide who comes to this country and in what circumstances” made for an effective political slogan at the last election, but how does it sound from the perspective of people from other countries? Put it in personal terms - would {{you want to go to}} stay at a hotel or holiday resort which had that as its marketing slogan? Sure, right at the moment there are enough people who want to come to Australia that we don’t need to worry too much about how attractive we make the place sound. That won’t be so in 2040. But by then it will be too late to try to repair the damage to our reputation - and we will lose out in the competition for migrants. Policies that exploit the fears and insecurities of current Australians thus are diminishing the hopes and prospects of our children. A second economic issue is our labour market, and the people qualities needed to make our economy prosper. Companies aiming to succeed in a fast moving world no longer look for employees with narrowly based skills or training - much more important is their capacity to develop new skills. An ideal employee, or for that matter the new small business owner, is resilient, innovative, has initiative, resourcefulness and a positive attitude. That sounds a lot to me like a person prepared to leave their home country to escape oppression and make their way across the world in search of something better. This is not just theory. Thousands of Vietnamese boat people who arrived in Australia under the Fraser government have been highly successful in all walks of life. Our economy and society has been the winner. Finally, there is a simple economic fact that mandatory detention is a huge impost on the budget. Detention camps are more expensive than if we were to put boat people up in a five star hotel - and that’s just the costs in Australia. The so-called Pacific solution is much more expensive. This is some of the economic story. For the record, I happen to think the refugee issue is a moral one. Refugees deserve respect and compassion regardless of how they come here, and current government policy is inhumane and diminishes our standing as a decent society. However, I don’t need to make these points to listeners who agree with me on moral grounds, and likewise I doubt I will ever convince those who disagree on moral grounds. What I hope is that readers who do not hold strong views either way on the ethical issues will at least consider the economic arguments. Current refugee {{policies are}} expensive {{in the short term}} and damage our economic prospects in the long term. As a nation, can we really afford to maintain them?
