5|$|Sir John William Dawson, McGill's {{principal}} from 1855 to 1893, {{is often}} credited with transforming the school <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> university. He recruited {{the aid of}} Montreal's wealthiest citizens (eighty percent of Canada's wealth was then controlled by families who lived within the Golden Square Mile area that surrounded the university), many of whom donated property and funding needed to construct the campus buildings. Their names adorn many of the campus's prominent buildings.|$|E
5|$|The Americans then {{suppressed}} other rebellious sub-states: mainly, {{the waning}} Sultanate of Sulu, {{as well as}} the insurgent Tagalog Republic, the Cantonal Republic of Negros in the Visayas, and the Republic of Zamboanga in Mindanao. During this era, a renaissance in Philippine culture occurred, with the expansion of Philippine cinema and literature. Daniel Burnham built an architectural plan for Manila which would have transformed it <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> city.|$|E

5|$|Until 1874 {{there were}} no modern {{industries}} in Hyderabad. With the introduction of railways in the 1880s, four factories were built {{to the south and}} east of Hussain Sagar Lake, and during the early 20th century, Hyderabad was transformed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> city with the establishment of transport services, underground drainage, running water, electricity, telecommunications, universities, industries, and Begumpet Airport. The Nizams ruled their princely state from Hyderabad during the British Raj.|$|E
5|$|Despite his fervour, Saglio's {{negotiations}} with the local people were unsuccessful. Niomoune and Carabane were the first two villages to attempt to apply this innovative approach, but both failed. The inhabitants were reluctant to participate, and the young inexperienced promoter had to abandon some of his ethnographic theories in favour of being careful to understand the daily realities of villages. The project was eventually abandoned, and the Catholic missions house was transformed by the nuns themselves <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern,</b> functional building. Despite the failure of Saglio's initiative in Carabane, agritourist camps were set up over the following decade in a dozen other nearby towns.|$|E
5|$|During the Livonian War, Estonia {{became part}} of the Lutheran Swedish kingdom. The Catholic Dome Church became a church with a Lutheran {{congregation}} and was then called the Castle Church. In 1625, the Swedish King Gustav II Adolf sold the town of Haapsalu, the castle and the nearby land property to Count Jacob De la Gardie, who planned to turn the dilapidated stronghold <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> castle. Arent Passer, a well-known sculptor and master builder, was invited as a consultant.|$|E

5|$|Founded in 1965, UC Santa Cruz {{began as}} a {{showcase}} for progressive, cross-disciplinary undergraduate education, innovative teaching methods and contemporary architecture. Since then, it has evolved <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> research university {{with a wide variety}} of both undergraduate and graduate programs, while retaining its reputation for strong undergraduate support and student political activism. The residential college system, which consists of ten small colleges, is intended to combine the student support of a small college with the resources of a major university.|$|E
5|$|The US 50 {{corridor}} is {{a historic}} one, used by many 49ers who came to California during the Gold Rush {{as well as the}} Pony Express. In 1895, part of the present-day route was designated as California's first state highway, and it was later considered as a scenic alternate of the Lincoln Highway. Much of US 50 was constructed during the initial construction of the California state highway system. During {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, US 50 was gradually designated and converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> highway.|$|E
5|$|The county {{facilities}} in the bailey were expanded during these years, with improvements to the Grand Jury House and the Common Hall, but by the 1680s {{the role of the}} military garrison at York Castle was being called into question. Sir Christopher Musgrave produced a report for the Crown in 1682; he argued that it would cost at least £30,000 to turn the castle <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> fortification, producing a proposal for the six bastions that such a star fort would require. This work was never carried out. Meanwhile, the garrison and the castle had become extremely unpopular with the people of York, who disliked both the cost and the imposition of external authority.|$|E

5|$|The first {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} the 14th century. A town grew up and received its municipal charter in 1692. Białystok has traditionally {{been one of the}} leading centers of academic, cultural, and artistic life in Podlachia and the most important economic center in northeastern Poland. Białystok was once an important center for light industry, which was the reason for the substantial growth of the city's population. The city continues to reshape itself <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> metropolis. Białystok in 2010, was on the short-list, but ultimately lost the competition to become a finalist for European Capital of Culture in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Aesthetically, {{the game}} used Fire Emblem {{elements}} as motifs, but took its setting and premise of {{a clash between}} worlds from Shin Megami Tensei. The battle system was originally going {{to be similar to}} a Fire Emblem game, but while it did incorporate elements such as the Weapon Triangle, it ultimately became a turn-based RPG battle system. After Atlus was made primary developer, the story was set in modern-day Tokyo and written around a group of young people facing challenges together. Its upbeat focus on character drama was a deliberate shift away from the dark scenarios of the Megami Tensei series. The game takes place in multiple locations around Tokyo, including Shibuya and Harajuku. The modern setting provided challenges for incorporating Fire Emblem characters, as characters in medieval armor just dropping <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> setting would have looked strange. Among the considered possibilities were introducing Fire Emblem characters as human party members. In the end, it was decided to make them summoned helpers similar to the demons of Shin Megami Tensei, drawn into the real world from their Idolosphere dimension.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{was given}} his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone, {{at the expense}} of long-serving Ron Powell, in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958. The game ended 2–2, and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the {{following}} match; {{by the end of the}} 1958–59 season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury. With no goalkeeping coaching to speak of, Banks had to learn from his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence. Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, it came as a surprise to Banks when Matt Gillies, manager of First Division club Leicester City, bought him from Chesterfield for £7,000 in July 1959; this also meant a wage increase to £15 a week.|$|E

5|$|Malmö FF's {{board of}} {{directors}} initiated {{the search for a}} new stadium in the mid-1990s. Malmö Stadion, where Malmö FF had played since its construction in 1958, was starting to deteriorate by this time, and was also too large for the club, which often struggled to fill it for Allsvenskan matches. In 1995, club chairman Bengt Madsen began {{to raise money for the}} renovation of Malmö IP, the club's former home between 1910 and 1957, <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> football stadium. Malmö IP was practical and economical for the club as it was already an extant site, and was smaller than Malmö Stadion, which was expensive to maintain. The renovation of Malmö IP was finished in August 1999, and Malmö FF moved in soon after. However, the renovated ground failed to live up to expectations, proving to be very basic by modern standards; the paltry capacity of 7,600 was also deemed a security issue. The club therefore moved back to Malmö Stadion in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Poland's {{communist}} government attempted {{to destroy the}} union by instituting martial law in 1981, followed by several years of political repression, {{but in the end}} was forced into negotiation. The Roundtable Talks {{between the government and the}} Solidarity-led opposition resulted in semi-free elections in 1989. By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed, and, in December 1990, Wałęsa was elected president. This was soon followed by the dismantling of the {{communist government}}al system and by Poland's transformation <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> democratic state. Solidarity's early survival represented a break in the hard-line stance of the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR), and was an unprecedented event; not only for the People's Republic of Poland—a satellite of the USSR ruled by a one-party communist regime—but for the whole of the Eastern bloc. Solidarity's example led to the spread of anti-communist ideas and movements throughout the Eastern Bloc, weakening communist governments. This process later culminated in the Revolutions of 1989.|$|E
5|$|The Kiautschou Bay concession, as {{it became}} known, existed from 1898 to 1914. With an area of , it was located in the {{imperial}} province of Shandong (alternatively romanized as Shantung or Shan-tung in English and Schantung in German) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula (Schantung-Halbinsel) in northern China. Tsingtao (Qingdao) was its administrative center. After the farmers and fishermen of the Chinese village sold their buildings and land and resettled in the rural communities further east, the Germans began to develop the area. Wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply were improvements that transformed the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> German town. In a short time the area had the highest density of schools and per capita student enrollment in all of China; primary, secondary and vocational schools were funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.|$|E
