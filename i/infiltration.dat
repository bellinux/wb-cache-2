5|$|As {{early as}} June 1961, General Maxwell D. Taylor, President John F. Kennedy's special {{military}} representative, had {{become interested in}} the prospect of erecting a physical barrier to halt the increasing <b>infiltration</b> of PAVN materiel (and later, manpower) through their Laotian logistical corridor and into the border regions of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). He then held talks with the Deputy Director of the Pentagon's Office of Special Operations, Edward G. Lansdale, who convinced him that a better solution to the <b>infiltration</b> dilemma would be the creation of mobile units to attack the infiltrators.|$|E

5|$|According to {{testimony}} {{by a federal}} agent, the federal government began infiltrating the Multnomah County Common Law Court via Steven Walsh, a government agent who attended the meetings under a false name and who even began to lead the organization.

40|$|Nursing {{interventions}} used {{to treat}} intravenous extravasations (<b>infiltrations)</b> generally include application of warmth or cold, elevation, and no treatment. In this article, the effect of elevation on <b>infiltrations</b> of 0. 45 % sodium chloride and 3 % saline made intentionally into healthy volunteers is reported. Elevation {{had no effect on}} pain, surface area of induration, or volume of infiltrate remaining as quantified by magnetic resonance imaging. A comparison of these data with previously published findings concerning the effect of warmth versus cold on <b>infiltrations</b> shows that no one treatment is better overall in decreasing the symptoms or speeding re-absorption of the infiltrate...|$|R

40|$|Small {{areas of}} skin {{infiltrated}} with immune serum proved refractory to the injurious action of a filterable rabbit virus inoculated 24 to 48 hours later. <b>Infiltrations</b> of normal serum did not appreciably protect the skin against the virus. The local protection {{afforded by the}} <b>infiltrations</b> of immune serum appears to constitute an example of local passive immunity. Small areas of skin infiltrated with either normal serum or meat infusion broth proved more refractory than normal skin to infection with hemolytic streptococci inoculated 24 hours later. The refractory state induced in the tissues was non-specific in character. A greater amount of local protection against hemolytic streptococci was afforded by <b>infiltrations</b> with a homologous immune serum than by <b>infiltrations</b> with normal serum. The difference {{in the amount of}} protection afforded by immune serum over that induced by normal serum may be thought of as representative of the degree of local passive immunity conferred...|$|R
5|$|After the North Korean <b>infiltration</b> on September 7 was repelled, the North Korean {{attack on}} Haman {{ground to a}} halt. The North Koreans, racked by {{logistical}} and manpower shortages, focused more heavily on their attacks against 24th Infantry positions on Battle Mountain, as well as 35th Infantry positions at the Nam River. 24th Infantry troops at Haman encountered only probing attacks until September 18.|$|E
5|$|By 1959, the 559th had 6,000 {{personnel}} in two regiments alone, the 70th and 71st, not including combat troops in security roles or North Vietnamese and Laotian civilian laborers. In {{the early days}} of the conflict the trail was used strictly for the <b>infiltration</b> of manpower. This was due to the fact that Hanoi could supply its southern allies much more efficiently by sea.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the example}} of Mozambique, the Zambian and Botswana governments {{permitted}} guerrillas to establish bases from which they could threaten and infiltrate Rhodesia. Van der Byl told a newspaper reporter that {{this had to be}} expected. As <b>infiltration</b> grew, he declared at the beginning of July that the Rhodesian Army would not hesitate to bomb and destroy villages that harboured guerillas.|$|E
40|$|Experimental reinjections with ascaric extract {{into the}} trachea and oral feeding with ascaris larvae in {{sensitized}} guinea pig produced blood eosinophilia and eosinophilic pulmonary infitrations (eosinophilic pneumonia). However, blood eosinophilia is no necessarily {{parallel with the}} degree of eosinophilic <b>infiltrations</b> in lungs; in other words, a parallel relationship as accepted was not present between blood eosinophilia and allergy, but rather between the eosinophilic <b>infiltrations</b> in lungs and allergy. In addition, after oral feeding of ascaris larvae, eosinophilic pulmonary <b>infiltrations</b> occurred, especially around the-migrating larvae in lung. From these experimental and pathologic evidences, {{it is suggested that}} allergy caused by ascaris is the immeidate cause of Loeffler's Syndrome...|$|R

40|$|THE {{extremely}} variable clinical {{manifestations of}} infectious mononucleosis may best be understood from studies * of the histologic {{features of the}} disease. These have shown widespread cellular <b>infiltrations</b> involving almost every organ in the body. While the lymph nodes and spleen usually are involved, pathologic changes are also common in the liver, kidney, heart, testis, central nervous system and lung. These changes are described as multiple localized <b>infiltrations</b> of mono-nuclear cells and small lymphocytes which may compress or replace normal par-enchyma. The clinical pattern accordingly will vary with the organs affected, and the great diversity of symptoms is explained by the widespread nature of the disease. Pulmonary <b>infiltrations</b> have been repeatedly demonstrated by roentgeno...|$|R

Bela Singh was later murdered in India in the 1930s. Hopkinson was assassinated in a Vancouver courthouse by a Ghadarite named Mewa Singh, in October, 1914.|$|E
5|$|For {{the past}} ten years, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has been {{assisting}} Zimbabwe's farmers to adopt conservation agriculture techniques, a sustainable method of farming that can help increase yields. By applying the three principles of minimum soil disturbance, legume-based cropping {{and the use of}} organic mulch, farmers can improve <b>infiltration,</b> reduce evaporation and soil erosion, and build up organic soil content.|$|E
5|$|From 1963 to 1966, RAN {{warships}} {{took part}} in the Indonesian Confrontation. During this period, Australian minesweepers and frigates patrolled Malaysia's coastline to counter Indonesian <b>infiltration</b> parties travelling in small craft. These ships also bombarded Indonesian positions in East Kalimantan near the border with Malaysia on several occasions. The RAN's experiences during this conflict led it to perceive a need for light destroyers and patrol boats tailored to Confrontation-type tasks.|$|E

Histologically, these proliferations contained fiber-rich connective tissue and some fibromuscular cells without significant differences between both stent types. The superficial tissue layer was formed by typical respiratory epithelium and polygonal cells. Abundant lymphocyte <b>infiltrations</b> and moderate granulocyte <b>infiltrations</b> were found in both groups correspondingly, whereas foreign-body reaction was more pronounced around sirolimus-eluting stents.|$|R
50|$|Part of the Dutch Navy {{was next}} {{stationed}} in Netherlands New Guinea until that, too, {{was turned over}} to the Indonesian government in 1962. This followed a campaign of <b>infiltrations</b> by the Indonesian National Armed Forces, supported by modern equipment from the Soviet Union, that was nevertheless successfully repulsed by the Dutch navy. These <b>infiltrations</b> took place after the order of President Sukarno to integrate the territory as an Indonesian province.|$|R
5|$|In 1959, Hanoi {{established}} the 559th Transportation Group {{under the command}} of Colonel (later General) Võ Bẩm to improve and maintain a transportation system to supply the NLF uprising against the South Vietnamese government.

In areas of the world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis). Hashimoto's may be associated with a goiter. It is characterized by <b>infiltration</b> of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.|$|E
