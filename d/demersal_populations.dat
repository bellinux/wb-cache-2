40|$|The {{frequently}} observed {{positive relationship}} between fish population abundance and spatial distribution suggests that changes in distribution can be indicative of trends in abundance. If contractions in spatial distribution precede declines in spawning stock biomass (SSB), spatial distribution reference points could complement the SSB reference points that are commonly used in marine conservation biology and fisheries management. When relevant spatial distribution information is integrated into fisheries management and recovery plans, risks and uncertainties associated with a plan {{based solely on the}} SSB criterion would be reduced. To assess the added value of spatial distribution data, we examine the relationship between SSB and four metrics of spatial distribution intended to reflect changes in population range, concentration, and density for 10 <b>demersal</b> <b>populations</b> (9 species) inhabiting the Scotian Shelf, Northwest Atlantic. Our primary purpose is to assess their potential to serve as indices of SSB, using fisheries independent survey data. We find that metrics of density offer the best correlate of spawner biomass. A decline in the frequency of encountering high density areas is associated with, and in a few cases preceded by, rapid declines in SSB in 6 of 10 populations. Density-based indices have considerable potential to serve both as an indicator of SSB and as spatially based reference points in fisheries management...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the hydrographic conditions observed during six surveys carried out during 2003 and 2004, {{in the framework}} of the >IDEA Project> (acronym for >Influence of oceanographic structure and dynamics on <b>demersal</b> <b>populations</b> in waters of the Balearic Islands>). The surveys were developed on the shelf and slope of Mallorca Island, in particular in two fishing grounds at the north and south of the Mallorca channel. Periodic movements of the fishing fleet between these two areas have been regularly reported, suggesting a seasonal variability of the resources which could be in turn associated with the hydrodynamic variability. With this motivation, water masses affecting these grounds have been identified and their seasonal variability has been studied. Different oceanographic and environmental conditions have been found between the two fishing grounds. These differences are related to the presence of mesoscale structures, associated with the Western Mediterranean Intermediate Water (WIW) at the north of the Ibiza channel and big gyres detached from the Algerian Current. The former has been shown to have influence on the regional oceanic circulation and the latter could affect the progress of fresh Atlantic Water (AW) towards the channels and make possible the presence of high salinity values at intermediate waters at the south of Mallorca Island. Historical data from other oceanographic cruises carried out in the region are finally used to discuss the interannual variability of these mesoscale structures. © 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Fishing affects {{patterns}} of energy use in fish populations, {{as demonstrated by}} changes in population energy consumption and the size and age when energy demands are greatest. We compare theoretical predictions and observed {{patterns of}} energy use (expressed as the primary production required to support fish production) by North Sea fish, based on simple and widely applicable theory that links life history parameters, fishing mortality (F), trophic transfer efficiency and relationships between size and trophic level (as determined using nitrogen stable isotope analysis). For the demersal species that dominate total biomass, relationships between size and trophic level were quite consistent among years. There were large decreases in relative energy requirements of all exploited <b>demersal</b> <b>populations</b> except plaice Pleuronectes platessa during the last 3 to 4 decades. Relative energy requirements of plaice were more stable because smaller plaice, which now dominate the exploited population, feed at higher trophic levels than larger plaice. The sizes and ages when population energy demands were greatest fell with increasing fishing mortality and differences between the predicted (F = 0) and observed ages at maximum energy demand were greater in larger species. Currently, the energy demands of most species peak early in life (1 - 3 years) and largely reflect patterns of recruitment, leading to a homogenisation of the trophodynamics of the fish community. The fate of energy {{that is no longer}} used by commercially exploited species is not clear, partly because of the infrequent and untargeted monitoring of species that are more resilient to fishing. However, we conducted a preliminary assessment of the energy demands of solenette Buglossidium luteum, a very abundant small flatfish in the central North Sea that has increased in abundance in recent years. The solenette's high abundance and resilience to fishing, suggests that it now requires 35 % of primary production in part of the central North Sea, energy that may have supported larger species in a less heavily fished ecosystem...|$|E

40|$|A stereo-video baited {{camera system}} (BotCam) has been {{developed}} as a fishery-independent tool to monitor and study deepwater fish species and their habitat. During testing, BotCam was deployed primarily in water depths between 100 and 300 m for an assessment of its use in monitoring and studying Hawaiian bottomfish species. Details of the video analyses and data from the pilot study with BotCam in Hawai`i are presented. Multibeam bathymetry and backscatter data were used to delineate bottomfish habitat strata, and a stratified random sampling design was used for BotCam deployment locations.

40|$|Samples of the {{demersal}} fish fauna {{have been collected}} by beam trawl from the coastal waters of northwest Europe (49 – 57 °N, 8 °W 9 °E) by the UK, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, since 1990, during {{the third quarter of}} the year. Changes in community structure within small spatial scales were subtle as species compositions formed part of a continuum over the entire continental shelf. Populations of low diversity were particularly evident in the German Bight and on the North Sea continental coast, where dab Limanda limanda were abundant. In the Channel and {{to the west of the}} UK the demersal assemblages were more species-rich than in the North Sea and, although dab was still an important member of the underlying fish assemblage, the abundance of other species, especially poor cod Trisopterus minutus, solenette Buglossidium luteum, plaice Pleuronectes platessa, and the lesser weever, Echiichthys vipera, allowed a range of different groups to be identified. Despite the greater species diversity in this westerly region only eight out of a total nineteen flatfish species were found in abundance. The dominance of different species in different size classes was a key feature of the community structure. Flatfish were the largest group by weight in the smaller-length classes (< 30 cm), and in western areas the elasmobranchs dominated the larger-size classes. Observed patterns in community structure were partly explained by the zoogeography of the region and the presence of the British Isles at the boundary between two faunal types. The additional influence on <b>demersal</b> <b>populations</b> of depth and substrate type, which may regulate the abundance of flatfish at key stages in their life history, was also discussed. In addition to these natural processes, recent increases in fishing effort are thought to have affected the structure of the demersal assemblage, and an examination of aggregated length-frequency distributions from these surveys tends to support this conclusion. Without further information on the distribution of fishing effort, it is not possible to separate the influence of natural faunal changes between regions from that of artificial changes caused by fishing activity...|$|E
40|$|Across {{the period}} 1988 - 2008, the most {{abundant}} demersal species were cod, redfish, Northern shrimp and Greenland halibut accounting, as an average, for the 83. 5 % of total index of biomass every year. The analyses of biomass indices showed that the demersal community experienced notable variations across the period 1988 - 2008, due to changes in biomass {{of most of the}} 67 <b>demersal</b> <b>populations</b> studied. The Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA) identified common trends in the trajectories of the 31 most abundant species in the demersal community. This suggests that the dynamics of the demersal species in the Flemish Cap are interconnected, and can be summarized by a few common patterns. The explanatory variables considered in the analyses appeared to be consistently important for the population biomass dynamic of these species. Water temperature, along with predation and fishing mortality were significant drivers of the Flemish Cap demersal community. The abundance of the less common demersal species was related with water temperature, with a transition in the species composition between cold and warm periods. Changes in the demersal community were globally registered in the diversity indexes and the Abundance Biomass Comparison (ABC) method, with notable variations in the relative location of biomass and abundance kdominance curves. The size based indicators showed marked declines in the size structure of the fish demersal community. Parallel to these changes in the demersal community, since 1993 important variations in feeding habits for the most important fish species were observed. First, strong variations in feeding habits with size were found in most fish species and hence, biological species were split into trophic species. These trophic species belonged to four different trophic guilds, the bentho-pelagic invertebrate feeders, the benthic invertebrate feeders, the pelagic invertebrate feeders and the piscivorous guild. Not only intra-guild but also inter-guild common trends were found. The dominant common trend was the increase on shrimp consumption for most trophic species, although in the piscivorous guild the consumption of redfish also presented an increasing trend. Parallel to this, intra-guild common trends toward the decline on consumption of their usual preys like ophiuroids, hyperiids and copepods were also detected. The variables accounting for common trends were mainly the abundance of prey species, the intra-guild competition and the oceanographic conditions. These common trends led to a higher overlap in feeding habits {{at the end of the}} study period. These results highlight the importance of trophic interactions in management decisions. The importance of key preys like Northern shrimp or juvenile redfish for other commercial species would need to be considered when establishing fishing quotas, i. e. a multispecies approach to fisheries management instead of a monospecific approach. On the other hand, variations in feeding habits with fish length highlight the necessity of considering the demographic structure of both prey and predators when including trophic interactions in management decisions. Contemporaneously with changes in abundance of the Flemish Cap cod, changes in reproduction, growth and condition were detected. The high fishing mortality registered in the late 1980 ’s and early 1990 ’s contributed very importantly to the observed decrease in cod biomass. A genetic change toward earlier age and smaller size at maturation was found already in the 1980 ’s but especially in the early 1990 ’s cohorts. The decrease in Female Spawning Stock Biomass (FSSB) as consequence of the steep decline of the population, in conjunction with the rejuvenation of the reproductive stock, led to the decrease in the Total Egg Production (TEP). The high correlation of TEP with the recruitment during this period supports that the decrease in the SRP was largely responsible of the recruitment failures since mid 1990 ’s. However, the low temperatures recorded between 1989 and 1997 may have also lead to unfavorable conditions for cod recruitment. Cod fishing still remained in the Flemish Cap until 1996, which in conjunction with the absence of good recruitments, was the final blow contributing to the collapse. Since then density-dependent processes led to an increase in condition and growth, favoring earlier maturation by phenotypic plasticity and a growing FSSB. Although not studied in this thesis, it is probable that during this period the higher fish condition would led to an increased relative fecundity, producing an increase in the TEP. In the absence of fishing pressure, a higher SRP together with improved feeding conditions and higher temperatures probably favored the good recruitment events observed since 2005 and the recovery of the stock. With previous information, an extended food web model, including the 14 most important fish demersal species and their main preys was developed. A simplified conceptual model with cod, redfish, shrimp and Greenland halibut trophic interactions, including all the main drivers for population and community dynamic was also created. This included inner drivers like population structure and abundance, growth, condition and SRP, and external drivers like oceanographic conditions, species interactions (mainly predation but also competition) and fishing. With this theoretical model and the information from previous analysis a description of the ecological functioning of the Flemish Cap demersal community was developed. Fishing activity in conjunction with predation and oceanographic conditions were considered the main drivers inducing changes in the population structure of various species through mortality of larval, juvenile and adult stages. These changes produced variations in trophic interactions between species, and density-dependent processes affecting to growth and condition. All these factors strongly affected to the SRP of populations, which in turn affected to population structure. Under this scenario, fishing on cod and redfish under adverse environmental conditions for recruitment and low SRP produced an imbalance in the ecosystem that led to the increase of shrimp and Greenland halibut by the release of predation and competition respectively. Redfish stocks benefited from the low biomass of a capital piscivorous like cod, showing excellent recruitments in a period of favorable oceanographic conditions. The higher availability of shrimp and redfish preys produced an increase in the SRP of cod, which favored the recovery of the cod stock since 2005. The increasing predation of a growing cod stock produced the decline of the redfish stock since 2008, while the Northern shrimp stock decline was ascribed to the increasing predatory pressure from both cod and redfish in conjunction with a very high fishing pressure. This conceptual model developed to study the ecological functioning of the demersal community in Flemish Cap supposes an integrative approach that represents an important step away from the traditional view of single species management in Flemish Cap. This type of contributions constitutes major steps towards a new framework for fisheries management that incorporates theoretical background on the functioning of marine ecosystems. Achieving a sustainable fishery requires to focus on sustaining relationships between species, which includes fishery within complex evolving ecosystems. Fisheries management should maintain these relationships stable and robust within a resilient ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of shallow-water marine species have a two-phase life cycle in which relatively sedentary, demersal adults produce pelagic larvae. Because these larval stages are potentially subject to dispersal by ocean currents, {{it has been}} widely accepted that local populations are open, with recruitment resulting from the arrival of larvae from non-local sources. However, {{a growing number of}} studies indicate that larvae are capable of recruiting back to their source population. Here, we review the evidence for self-recruitment in <b>demersal</b> marine <b>populations,</b> drawing from studies of endemism, introduced species, population genetics, stock-recruitment relationships, larval distributions, populations at the limit of a species' range, and applications of environmental and chemical markers. These studies indicate that self-recruitment can and does occur across species representative of most life history traits and geographical localities. Thus, the ability of larvae to recruit back to their natal population may be a pervasive phenomenon among marine species, The mounting evidence in support of self-recruitment dynamics indicates a pressing need for a re-evaluation of the appropriateness of demographically-open population models and their applicability to the management and conservation of marine ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|This {{chapter is}} the first attempt to {{describe}} {{major changes in the}} population of marine animals in the seas of Southeast Asia since 1850. Using a wide variety of anecdotal evidence, it begins by building up a picture of populations of fish and other marine animals in the mid 1800 s. Having established this as a rough baseline, it argues that only a few fish populations, most notably those of fusiliers, which inhabited coral reefs exploited by Japanese muro ami fishers, underwent significant change before 1940. Beginning in the late 1940 s in the Philippines and the 1960 s in the Gulf of Thailand, there were dramatic drops in the <b>population</b> of <b>demersal</b> fish, only partially compensated by increases in squids and other species which had been the prey or competitors of these fish. As <b>demersal</b> fish <b>populations</b> fell, fishers turned their attention to various pelagic species, which in turn underwent declines.

A review of scientific research is given with special reference to a long term ecological monitoring programme. Relevant clauses concerning the exploration and exploitation of the Belgian continental shelf were elaborated in the law of 13 June 1969. In application to this law two Royal Decrees were published to regulate exploitation. The ecological monitoring programme investigated benthic communities and <b>demersal</b> fish <b>population</b> since 1977. Close {{attention was paid to}} the evolution of dominant species belonging to the epibenthic fauna e. g. the brittle stars (Ophiura texturata and Ophiura albida), the common starfish (Asterias rubens), the brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) and the common swimming crab (Macropipus holsatus) in relation to sedimentological features. The southeastern part of this sand extraction area is a nursery ground for dab (Limanda limanda) and sole (Solea solea) mostly belonging to the pre-recruit 0 -age group. A small stock of adult dab with commercial size inhabited the area, although the area was dominated by Gadiformes (Merlangius merlangus, Trisopterus luscus, Limanda limanda and Pleuronectes platessa).

40|$|Nature {{conservation}} and fisheries management often focus on particular seabed {{features that are}} considered vulnerable or important to commercial species. As a result, individual seabed types are protected in isolation, without any understanding of what effect the mixture of seabed types within the landscape has on ecosystem functions. Here we undertook predictive seabed modelling within a coastal marine protected area using observations from underwater stereo-video camera deployments and environmental information (depth, wave fetch, maximum tidal speeds, distance from coast and underlying geology). The effect of the predicted substratum type, extent and heterogeneity or the diversity of substrata, within a radius of 1500 m around each camera deployment of juvenile gadoid relative abundance was analysed. The predicted substratum model performed well with wave fetch and depth being the most influential predictor variables. Gadus morhua (Atlantic cod) were associated with relatively more rugose substrata (Algal-gravel-pebble and seagrass) and heterogeneous landscapes, than Melanogrammus aeglefinus (haddock) or Merlangius merlangus (whiting) (sand and mud). An increase in M. merlangus relative abundance was observed with increasing substratum extent. These results reveal that landscape effects should be considered when protecting the seabed for fish and not just individual seabed types. The landscape approach {{used in this study}} therefore has important implications for marine protected area, fisheries management and monitoring advice concerning <b>demersal</b> fish <b>populations...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{a general}} context of {{fisheries}} decline due to overfishing {{and to other}} phenomena such as climate change, {{it appears to be}} crucial to implement a sustainable management of natural resources by finding a balance between conservation and exploitation purposes. Artificial reefs (ARs) have recently become one of the existing management tools, often in combination with fishing quotas or marine protected areas. To evaluate the effectiveness of the studied ARs, different methods have been used: (i) visual census by SCUBA diving (AR scale), (ii) fisheries landings survey (local scale) and (iii) external fish tagging (regional scale). Underwater visual census (UVC) showed a significantly higher species richness and density in ARs than in the control site. Abundance, biomass and LPUE data (Landings Per Unit Effort) issued from artisanal fisheries landings survey were not significantly different around the AR system from other fishing grounds of the French Catalan coast. The tagging experiments on Diplodus sargus suggested that the connectivity of <b>demersal</b> fish <b>populations</b> {{must be taken into account}} to evaluate the influence area of ARs and thus their indirect impacts on artisanal fisheries.

40|$|Spatial {{variation}} in growth {{is a common}} feature of <b>demersal</b> fish <b>populations</b> which often exist as discrete adult sub-populations linked by a pelagic larval stage. However, it remains unclear whether {{variation in}} growth occurs at similar spatial scales for populations of highly migratory pelagic species, such as tuna. We examined spatial variation in growth of albacore Thunnus alalunga across 90 ° of longitude in the South Pacific Ocean from {{the east coast of}} Australia to the Pitcairn Islands. Using length-at-age data from a validated ageing method we found evidence for significant variation in length-at-age and growth parameters (L(∞) and k) between sexes and across longitudes. Growth trajectories were similar between sexes up until four years of age, after which the length-at-age for males was, on average, greater than that for females. Males reached an average maximum size more than 8 cm larger than females. Length-at-age and growth parameters were consistently greater at more easterly longitudes than at westerly longitudes for both females and males. Our results provide strong evidence that finer spatial structure exists within the South Pacific albacore stock and {{raises the question of whether}} the scale of their "highly migratory" nature should be re-assessed.

These two periods {{coincide with the}} on-set of the commercial deep-water fishery in the late 1970 s and the on-set of the regulation of the fishery in the early 2000 's and allowed us to investigate changes {{in the relationship between}} total demersal fish biomass and depth between the pre- and post commercial fishing periods, changes in the biomass (kg km 2 ) depth distribution and length frequency distribution of the most dominant fish species. Our results show a decline in total demersal fish biomass of 36 % within the depth range of the commercial fishery (Coryphaenoides rupestris decreased by 57 %) and non-target (e. g. Coryphaenoides guentheri and Antimora rostrata) species, not all species declined significantly. Changes in the overall length-frequency distribution were detected for 2 species (Coryphaenoides armatus, Synaphobranchus kaupii), but only at depths greater than 1800 m (outside the maximum depth for commercial trawling). This suggests that whilst there is evidence for likely fisheries impacts on the biomass distribution of the <b>demersal</b> fish <b>population</b> as a whole, species-specific impacts are highly variable. It is clear that changes in population structure can extend beyond the depth at which fishing takes place, highlighting the importance for also considering the indirect effects on deep-sea fish populations...|$|R
40|$|The Georges Bank {{ecosystem}} {{has undergone}} {{dramatic changes in}} biomass and species dominance under exploitation. Sharp declines in the biomass of both pelagic and <b>demersal</b> fish <b>populations</b> have occurred associated with rapid increases in fishing effort by distant water fleets. We corrected nominal effort series for changes in vessel size, gear type and country of origin {{in an attempt to}} provide a measure of the intensity of the perturbation resulting from large scale changes in exploitation patterns on Georges Bank. A fourfold increase was noted in standardized effort over the period 1960 – 72. Declines in catch-per-standard day fished, and relative biomass indices derived from research vessel surveys indicated marked decreases in all components of the system during the period 1960 – 76. Decreases in fishing effort were effected with the implementation of extended jurisdiction to 200 miles in 1977; however, several major stocks had collapsed by that time. Fundamental changes were noted in the production levels on Georges Bank during the period 1960 – 76. Declines in overall production can be attributed largely to the collapse of the herring population by 1976 – 77 under heavy exploitation. Recent increases in biomass of elasmobranchs and principal pelagic species (herring and mackerel) have resulted in further shifts in system structure. The biomass of piscivores is currently high and this shift may act synergistically with increasing exploitation rates to cause further declines in biomass of commercially desirable species...|$|R

This study was aimed at determining missing parameters on spawning periodicity and maturity of S. sutor for the Kenyan south coast area of Msambweni, complementing a suite of parallel studies on spawning aggregation based fisheries for this species. A total of 376 samples were collected over 12 months, including 85 that were collected over four lunar phases in November and December 2010. Monthly GSI showed two distinct peaks, one in June and July and one in November and January, suggested two distinct spawning periods within the year. The highest GSI was recorded in November while the lowest values occurred in April August and September. A lunar pattern in ovarian development stage was seen with the highest proportion of ripe ovaries (RI) observed in the full moon phase, whereas running ripe (RR) or hydrated ovaries dominated samples in the last quarter. Imminent spawning was confirmed by the presence of hydrated oocytes and post ovulatory follicles, observed primarily during the last quarter and to a lesser extent during full moon.

It has been shown earlier (Sivalingam and Medcof 1957, Sivalingam 1969 a) that the Wadge Bank stock is made up of two groups.

40|$|During the 1960 s, water {{management}} practices {{resulted in the}} conversion of the wetlands that fringe northeastern Florida Bay (USA) from freshwater/oligohaline herbaceous marshes to dwarf red mangrove forests. Coincident with this conversion were several ecological changes to Florida Bay’s fauna, including reductions in the abundances of top trophic-level consumers: piscivorous fishes, alligators, crocodiles, and wading birds. Because these taxa rely on a common forage base of small demersal fishes, food stress has been implicated as playing a role in their respective declines. In the present study, we monitored the demersal fishes seasonally at six sites over an 8 -year time period. During monitoring, extremely high rainfall conditions occurred over a 3. 5 -year period leading to salinity regimes that can be viewed as “windows” to the area’s natural past and future restored states. In this paper, we: (1) examine the changes in fish communities over the 8 -year study period and relate them to measured changes in salinity; (2) make comparisons among marine, brackish and freshwater demersal fish communities in terms of species composition, density, and biomass; and (3) discuss several implications of our findings in light of the intended and unintended {{water management}} changes that are planned or underway as part of Everglades restoration. Results suggest the reduction in freshwater flow to Florida Bay over the last several decades has reduced <b>demersal</b> fish <b>populations,</b> and thus prey availability for apex consumers in the coastal wetlands compared to the pre-drainage inferred standard. Furthermore, greater discharge of freshwater toward Florida Bay may result in the re-establishment of pre- 1960 s fauna, including a more robust demersal-fish community that should prompt increases in populations of several important predatory species...|$|R

Signatures of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes that are incorporated into otoliths vary regionally in surface waters, and thus reflect differences in water composition among habitats, making them suitable to trace earlier residence areas of fish. In this study, we determined the stable carbon and oxygen isotope signatures in the juvenile margin of otoliths of adult yellowtail snappers (Ocyurus chrysurus) from coral reefs, and compared these to the signatures in otoliths of juvenile fish collected in different nursery embayments harboring seagrass beds, to trace the origin of individual reef fishes. Unique in our approach is that our experimental reef fish represent a complete population {{on the scale of}} an entire island, and that all potential nurseries were sampled. Of all adult reef fish caught, 97 % were identified as having resided as juveniles in one of the seagrass nurseries, yet different bays contributed unequally to the adult population. Additionally, we combined these data with a spatial simulation model that showed that adult dispersal away from reef areas near the mouth of bays was limited. These findings show that the spatial distribution of nursery areas and their productivity are important drivers of population dynamics, and can lead to a source-sink structure in a closed <b>demersal</b> fish <b>population</b> on the reef. Understanding source-sink dynamics of marine animals is of major importance for the design and placement of marine reserves, especially when life stages utilize spatially different habitats and sourcesink dynamics occur within life stages...|$|R
40|$|In {{the marine}} environment, small forage species can predate on, or compete with, the pre-recruits of their larger predators. The "cultivation effect" {{hypothesis}} proposes that this mechanism can {{slow down the}} recovery of depleted <b>populations</b> of large <b>demersal</b> fishes by creating Allee effects that lower their recruitment success. Using an individual based fish community model applied to the southern Benguela ecosystem, we simulate situations of potential cultivation effect on a population of shallow water hake Merluccius capensis. We search for evidence of Allee effects due to cultivation and investigate how complex trophic interactions could influence their underlying mechanisms and impact. The resilience of the shallow water hake population was measured by following the variations of the ratio R/S (the number of recruits over the number of spawners) when population size decreases and the predators and competitors of shallow water hake pre-recruits were identified. Simulations suggest that cultivation effects are likely to emerge within the fish community of the southern Benguela ecosystem. Our twelve species model emphasizes that cultivation effects result from complex influences of predation and competition on the different pre-recruit stages, whose trophic role depends on both body size and geographical distribution. For realistic linkages between forage species and shallow water hake pre-recruits, cultivation effects occurring in {{the limits of the}} southern Benguela fish community are predicted to delay population recovery by several decades. These significant delays are not characterized by a decrease of R/S at low stock size, which is the sign usually tracked when looking for Allee effects. Our study suggests that cultivation effects could {{play a major role in}} the dynamics of overexploited large <b>demersal</b> fish <b>populations</b> and pleads for the development of improved detection techniques for these processes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{variability in}} the marine ecosystem of Ghana, West Africa, on several temporal and spatial scales and discusses how the human communities using this ecosystem respond to this variability to cope socially and economically. Ghanaian marine waters {{are part of an}} upwelling system with strong seasonal and inter-annual variability. Much of this variability is forced at large spatial scales in the tropical Atlantic and by El Niño [...] Southern Oscillation events in the Pacific Ocean, which influence inter-annual variability of sea surface temperature and pelagic fish landings off Ghana. At decadal scales, Ghanaian marine waters experienced cool sea temperatures and low fishery landings during the 1960 s, rapid warming and increases in fishery landings during the late 1970 s and 1980 s, and variable temperatures and fishery landings during the 1990 s. In the late 1990 s, pelagic and <b>demersal</b> fish <b>populations</b> appeared to be declining, partly due to over-fishing, although the per capita supply (domestic production plus net imports) of fish was kept high by increased imports. Artisanal fishers and fishing communities in Ghana have devised strategies to deal with variability on seasonal and inter-annual scales. These livelihood strategies include: (i) exploiting marine and terrestrial natural resources more intensively, initially at local scales but expanding to regional scales; (ii) ensuring multiple and diversified income sources; (iii) investing in social relationships and communities for support; and (iv) undertaking seasonal or permanent migrations. In addition, the national government imports fish to deal with shortages. However, these strategies may be less adapted to variability at decadal scales, and may not be sustainable when viewed at the larger scales of environmental change.

40|$|This study loolcs at {{demersal}} fish food web interactions {{present at the}} Rockall Trough. Rockall Trough lies within Ices division V. This area is highly exploited {{by a number of}} mixed deep-water fisheries. Despite this there has been a lag in management of the area and an overall lack of knowledge of food web interactions. From examining previous literature and carrying out stable isotope analysis on a number of species, it became clear that there is a strong link between the <b>demersal</b> fish <b>population</b> and surface production. Pervious studies have suggested there to be two main sources of food to the {{demersal fish}} fauna. The first is via the exploitation of pelagic species on the slops exploitation of mesopelagic and benthopelagic prey species that overlap in depth range, or/and that carry out vertical /horizontal migrations. Carcase falls also fall within this first source of food to the deep-sea as they are a direct link to the surface. The second source of food is that of endemic benthic prey species, which appears to be less prominent in the fishes diet. A large number of demersal fish are seen to feed on a combination of these sources of food. Stable isotope analysis, appear to confirm the strong link between surface production and demersal fish as many fish are found with low SN 15 levels normally associated with feeding on pelagic species. The removal of commercial mesopelagic species found to be important prey species to the demersal fish fauna, can have serious implications to the demersal food web and ultimately the management of deep-sea stocks. Issues relating to lack of a holistic approach in management and pollution concerns are mentioned. Keywords: U.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{makes use of}} the {{fisheries}} survey data collected during the period 1984 - 87 by the multi-purpose research vessel RV Anusandhani {{in the waters of}} Bangladesh, Bay of Bengal. The data consists of twelve survey cruises directed at the shrimp resources (1985 - 87) and nineteen survey cruises directed at the demersal fish resources (1984 - 86). The biomasses for shrimp and demersal fish during the survey period were estimated, along with a detailed analysis of biomass distribution by depth zone and catch rates for important species of shrimp and demersal fish species. The demersal fish and shrimp biomass during the survey period was estimated as 176 160 t and 857 t, respectively. The levels of biomass when compared with 1973 estimates indicate a tremendous decline, by about 90 % for shrimps and 30 % for <b>demersal</b> fish. <b>Population</b> parameters for four species of shrimps (for both males and females) as well as for eight demersal fish species were also estimated. The parameter estimates were validated using available growth and mortality parameter values from the literature, and were in turn used to estimate the mean exploitation rate (E) of demersal fish and shrimp species comprising the trawl catch. Mean E values for shrimp species is at 0. 61 and 0. 57 for demersal fish species, indicating over-exploitation of demersal resources in the Bay of Bengal. Exploratory analysis using surplus production modeling of catch and effort data shows that the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) level for shrimp resources is around 3 500 t, corresponding to a maximum effort level of approximately 6 480 fishing days. Similar analysis for demersal fish catches gave poor correlations between catch rates and fishing effort.

40|$|Fishing {{and other}} {{anthropogenic}} impacts {{have led to}} declines in many fish stocks and modification of the seabed. As a result, efforts to restore marine ecosystems have become increasingly focused on spatially explicit management methods to protect fish and the habitats they require for survival. This {{has led to a}} proliferation of investigations trying to map ‘habitats’ vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts and identify fish resource requirements in order to meet conservation and management needs. A wide range of habitat-related concepts, with different uses and understandings of the word ‘habitat’ itself has arisen as a consequence. Inconsistencies in terminology can cause confusion between studies, making it difficult to investigate and understand the ecology of fish and the factors that affect their survival. Ultimately, the inability to discern the relationships between fish and their environment clearly can hinder conservation and management measures for fish populations. This review identifies and addresses the present ambiguity surrounding definitions of ‘habitat’ and habitat-related concepts currently used in spatial management of <b>demersal</b> marine fish <b>populations.</b> The role of spatial and temporal scales is considered, in addition to examples of how to assess fish habitat for conservation and management purposes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract North Sea {{demersal}} fishes and fisheries {{have changed over}} the past 100 years. To detect the main factors driving these changes, long-term data are needed. Using historical fisheries data that extend throughout the 20 th century, this thesis aims to assess drivers influencing developments in fisheries as well as changes in the distribution and abundance of commercially important fishes in the North Sea. For English demersal fisheries, favourable political, technological and economical drivers were identified, inducing a vast rise in English fisheries {{in the first half}} of the 20 th century; however, the same drivers, acting adversely, influenced the decline in recent decades and the emphasis of fisheries shifted from England to Scotland. Different trends in distribution were observed for North Sea whiting, turbot and brill between the 1920 s and 2000 s. Whiting distribution shifted westward between the late 1940 s and 1960 s, whereas turbot nearly disappeared from the northern North Sea from the 1970 s onwards. Brill distribution remained rather stable in the central and southern North Sea. The reasons for the longitudinal shift of whiting remained unclear as the relationships to two potential drivers, climate change and fishing pressure, were not strong. For turbot, the cause for the near disappearance from the northern North Sea is inconclusive. Commercial fisheries data were assessed reliable for distribution analysis when comparing commercial data of whiting, a commonly discarded species, and unbiased survey data. Whiting, compared to flatfish, is of secondary commercial importance. In areas where discrepancies occurred between commercial and survey data, higher discarding of whiting is suggested, as highly priced flatfish are caught there. This thesis demonstrates past conditions of <b>demersal</b> fish <b>populations</b> and fisheries in the North Sea and presents the effects of different drivers on them. The documented changes in fishes and fisheries contain valuable information for resetting baselines and developing appropriate management strategies. *[N.

40|$|Predatory {{demersal}} fish are declining {{on a global}} scale but in many cases {{there is a lack of}} ecological information to assist management agencies in reducing the decline. Information on population structure and connectivity is central to our ecological understanding, not just for fisheries biology but also more broadly for conservation and persistence of species. Natural tags and satellite telemetry can help address population structure questions. Various tags were used to investigate population structure and connectivity of the important mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus) in southern Australia. Fifteen microsatellite markers were developed to help determine the genetic population structure of mulloway. These markers were tested, and found to be useful, on other members of the family sciaenidae and hence can be used to investigate molecular structure in other sciaenids. Within mulloway, broad scale genetic structuring between South African and Australian mulloway was evident. Within Australia, four genetic populations across the range of mulloway were also evident. Biogeographic factors drove population structuring, as determined using decomposed pairwise regression, a rarely applied approach in the marine environment. Furthermore, our results form a growing body of evidence suggesting population structure is possible in the connected marine environment. The various natural tags have different advantages and disadvantages, hence, by applying multiple approaches concurrently a greater scrutiny of population structure can be achieved. However, there is continuing debate on how best to integrate multiple approaches and thus condensing and producing simplified results ready for managing agency interpretation. Three approaches, namely, microsatellites, otolith chemistry and otolith shape were applied to the same mulloway samples. These three approaches are each affected by different intrinsic and extrinsic factors and are informative over different temporal scales. Thus, an overall integrated tag was obtained that provides a broader ‘body of evidence’ to population structure. The results also demonstrated that integration of different data sets was feasible prior to statistical testing, facilitating a single overall result. However there were some slight differences in the results produced by the different approaches, which highlights the need for a thorough understanding of the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on natural tags. To properly interpret data from natural tags it is useful to understand factors contributing to variation in the tag. Otolith chemistry is a widely used natural tag, but differing responses to environmental parameters have been reported. Temperature and salinity were manipulated in a controlled laboratory setting along with intrinsic (population) differences and their effects on the otolith chemical tag investigated. A significant influence of genetic population on otolith chemistry was found and also evident was a response to temperature. This understanding of mulloway otolith chemistry will enable more accurate estimation of environmental patterns and supports the view that the otolith chemical tag is more complex than previously thought. Satellite telemetry can be used to track fish movement while also logging environmental information. This technology has been used on pelagic and benthic predatory fish, but has not been used on demersal finfish. Whilst the natural tags can provide indirect evidence of movements, satellite telemetry has the ability to provide direct information on fish movements. Satellite telemetry was utilised on an isolated population of mulloway to provide information on the spatial scale of movements of mulloway; this information was related to movement in and out of marine parks. The results demonstrated the medium spatial scale of movements (up to 500 km) was similar to other predatory {{demersal fish}} and whilst undergoing these movements the fish interacted with marine park boundaries. Thus satellite telemetry was a useful approach for understanding <b>demersal</b> fish <b>population</b> dynamics. Several approaches were successfully implemented to investigate population structure and movements of a large predatory fish, mulloway. A better understanding of population structure could assist management of some species. An enhanced understanding of predatory fish populations and the associated scientific approaches used to study such populations is urgent, due to the worldwide decline. Thesis (Ph. D.)
