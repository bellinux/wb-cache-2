The response obtained from complete diet was shown to be due to fish meal and a dried fish solubles supplement.

Higher marbling scores and quality grades and a whiter external fat resulted from increased feeding. Lean texture did not differ (P<[. 05) among feeding regimes, but tended to be finer in longer fed cattle. Bone maturity increased over a 98 -day feeding period, but remained well within the A maturity range. Longer feeding increased carcass weight, fat thickness, ribeye area, internal fat and numerical yield grade and reduced cooler shrinkage. All taste panel responses (tenderness, desirability of flavor of lean and fat and juiciness) to longissimus samples favored longer fed beef. Generally, nutritional regime did not affect shear force measurement, however, some differences in shear force were noted in biceps femoris muscle. Carcasses from cattle fed the longest time and the highest plane of nutrition had the most desirable quality and palatability characteristics.

40|$|The term “Early Weaning” {{tends to}} be used rather loosely in the Beef Industry, and {{producers}} can find many articles claiming benefits of early weaning. A few questions arise. How early is early weaning? Is there economic benefit to weaning early? We will address these questions in this paper. At the Range Beef Cow Symposium XIV, Whittier (1995) categorized early weaning as 1) weaning {{before the start of}} the breeding season (birth to 90 days) or 2) weaning during the breeding season (90 to 160 days). Weaning calves {{before the start of the}} breeding season has shown to improve reproductive performance of cattle during the year in which calves are weaned (Geary et al., 2006; Lusby et al., 1981). Improved reproduction can be due to removal of the sucking stimulus and/or from improved energy balance of the cattle. Cattle that are in marginal to thin body condition score at the start of breeding may benefit more than well conditioned cattle (Whittier, 1995). Weaning calves late in the breeding season likely will not yield any improvements in reproduction during the year in which calves are weaned. While calves can be weaned at 60 - 100 days, more intense calf management is necessary, making the practice unpractical for many producers. Recent worked out of Miles City, MT showed that calves weaned early at 80 days and put on a <b>growing</b> <b>ration</b> until herd-mates were weaned at about 215 days resulted in the early weaning system having significantly less net income than the normal weaning system (Waterman et al., 2006). Weaning towards the end of the breeding season, 120 - 160 days, is more practical and can have benefits in certain situations. This paper will focus on time of weaning calves from 120 days and beyond...|$|E

Morale was boosted on November 18, {{when the first}} group of volunteers from the United States, the New Orleans Greys, joined the Texian army. Unlike the {{majority}} of the Texian volunteers, the Greys looked like soldiers, with uniforms, well-maintained rifles, adequate ammunition, and some semblance of discipline.|$|R
40|$|Silage {{is being}} {{utilized}} in larger quantities in beef cattle <b>growing</b> and fattening <b>rations.</b> Hammes et al. (1964) showed that {{higher levels of}} corn silage can be used because gains from high silage and high grain rations are similar. However, more total digestible nutrients may be harvested per acre {{and the cost of}} gain is usually less with silage. Several investigators have shown advantages to certain additives with silage...|$|R

It is characterized as: (1) following familial lines. (2) occurring primarily at 6 - 12 months of age. (3) relating to certain conformations. (4) unrelated to stress or nutritional levels of calcium, phosphorous, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, and protein. (5) occuring in fast growing swine.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to identify alterations in the histomorphology of the cortical bone tissue of broilers submitted to <b>growing</b> and finisher <b>rations</b> formulated with five different sources of phosphorus: dicalcium phosphate, simple superphosphate, triple superphosphate, monoammonium phosphate and Araxá rock phosphate. Histological images had their components segmented, and were called regions of interest (ROI). Images were analyzed through developed algorithms, using the SCILAB mathematical environment. Eleven features were considered {{in order to obtain}} a complete description of the bone images: percentage of bone by area, ROI area, ROI perimeters, ROI elongation, ROI angle and their respective standard deviations, besides entropy of ROI angles and a texture-oriented measure (lacunarity). The substitution of dicalcium phosphate in <b>growing</b> and finisher <b>rations</b> for any other tested source of phosphorus caused significant changes on the hystomorphology of the cortical broilers bones, for example: diminution of bone percentage by area, increase of lacuna area and worse matrix homogeneity. Changes were more pronounced in the Araxá rock phosphate treatments, with the highest fluorine content, than in simple superphosphate, triple superphosphate and monoammonium phosphate treatments, which were similar. 200...|$|R
