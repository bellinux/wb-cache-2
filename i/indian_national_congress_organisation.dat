5000|$|Although Malabari {{stayed away}} from the <b>Indian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> as an <b>organisation,</b> Malabari {{attended}} the <b>Indian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> in Bombay in 1885, and [...] "he was a nationalist" [...] and he had a close relationship with Dadabhai Naoroji," [...] one of the founders and leaders of the Congress. It was however to his advantage to not allow his name to be brought in connection with any specific political party or movement, and would have precluded support from British politicians in his campaign for social reform {{as well as from the}} Indian princes of Patiala, Gwalior and Bikaner upon whose financial generosity he depended.|$|R
25|$|Although the <b>Indian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> (INC), the <b>organisation</b> {{leading the}} {{struggle}} for Indian independence, had passed resolutions conditionally supporting the fight against fascism, some Indian public opinion was more hostile toward Britain's unilateral decision to declare India a belligerent {{on the side of}} the Allies. Among the more rebellious Indian political leaders of the time was Subhas Chandra Bose, a former INC president, who was viewed as a potent enough threat by the British that he was arrested when the war started. Bose escaped from house arrest in India in January 1941 and made his way through Afghanistan to the Soviet Union, with some help from Germany's military intelligence, the Abwehr. Once he reached Moscow, he did not receive the expected Soviet support for his plans for a popular uprising in India, and the German ambassador in Moscow, Count von der Schulenberg, soon arranged for Bose to go to Berlin. He arrived at the beginning of April 1941, and he met with foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and later Adolf Hitler. In Berlin, Bose set up the Free India Centre and Azad Hind Radio, which commenced broadcasting to Indians on shortwave frequencies, reaching tens of thousands of Indians who had the requisite receiver. Soon Bose's aim became to raise an army, which he imagined would march into India with German forces and trigger the downfall of the Raj.|$|R
