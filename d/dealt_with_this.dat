25|$|János Jankó (Tótkomlós, October 1, or November 3, 1833 - Budapest, March 29, 1896), {{originally}} a painter, but for financial reasons {{chose to be}} a journal illustrator.

25|$|The Martin {{family were}} {{probably}} among the Palatine Germans who fled that region of Germany for London {{in the late}} 17th century.

Ultimately 30,000 residents of the area made their way to London, and the Crown <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> growing population of the displaced in 1710 by resettling some of them elsewhere in the nascent British Empire.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} before public social {{services}}, the force functioned as a social services mega-agency. Prior {{the creation of the}} Toronto Humane Society in 1887 and the Children’s Aid Society in 1891, the police oversaw animal and child welfare, including the enforcement of child support payments. They operated the city's ambulance service and acted as the Board of Health. Police stations at the time were designed with space for the housing of homeless, as no other public agency in Toronto <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> problem. Shortly before the Great Depression, in 1925, the Toronto Police housed 16,500 homeless people that year.|$|E
25|$|On the building's {{top level}} (the 40th floor), {{there is a}} bar for tenants and their guests, {{featuring}} {{a panoramic view of}} London. A restaurant operates on the 39th floor, and private dining rooms on the 38th. Whereas most buildings have extensive lift equipment {{on the roof of the}} building, this was not possible for the Gherkin, since a bar had been planned for the 40th floor. The architects <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> by having the main lift only reach the 34th floor, and then having a push-from-below lift to the 39th floor. There is a marble stairwell and a disabled persons' lift, which leads the visitor up to the bar in the dome.|$|E
25|$|One {{man who has}} {{encountered}} this problem is Taiwanese politician Yu Shyi-kun, due to the rarity of the last character in his name. Newspapers have <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> problem in varying ways, including using software to combine two existing, similar characters, including {{a picture of the}} personality, or, especially {{as is the case with}} Yu Shyi-kun, simply substituting a homophone for the rare character in the hope that the reader would be able to make the correct inference. Taiwanese political posters, movie posters etc. will often add the bopomofo phonetic symbols next to such a character. Japanese newspapers may render such names and words in katakana instead of kanji, and it is accepted practice for people to write names for which they are unsure of the correct kanji in katakana instead.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{technical}} difficulties {{for such a}} railway. About half of the second section was built on barely permanent permafrost. In the summer, the uppermost layer thaws, and the ground becomes muddy. The heat from the trains passing above is able to melt the permafrost even with a small change in temperature. The main engineering challenge, aside from oxygen shortages, is {{the weakness of the}} permafrost. For areas of permafrost that are not very fragile, an embankment of large rocks is sufficient. Meanwhile, in the most fragile areas, the rail bed must be elevated like a bridge. The engineers <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> problem in the areas of weakest permafrost by building elevated tracks with pile-driven foundations sunk deep into the ground. Similar to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, portions of the track are also passively cooled with ammonia-based heat exchangers.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{agree that}} Díaz was never sympathetic to all Indians. In fact, {{he stated that}} the Yaquis and the Mayas {{had always been a}} pest for Mexico and that they needed to be <b>dealt</b> <b>with.</b> <b>This</b> {{is not to say that}} Díaz loved the rest of Mexico’s Indians. Perhaps, it could be argued that Díaz’s ultimate drive was that of economic expansion. Once Díaz amassed absolute legislative power, his indigenismo went out of the picture. It was not so much about elevating the lower classes into modern society and thus integrating them, but more about the economic and power status of the nation. After all, Indians composed less than half of Mexico’s population and their unwillingness to participate in the dominant culture made them political enemies of the state, especially those who persistently refused assimilation like the Yaqui and the Maya.|$|E
25|$|The whites <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> {{problem of}} {{potential}} political {{power by the}} 1908 amendment, which in practice disenfranchised blacks and poor whites, {{nearly half of the}} state population. It required that any male at least 21 years of age wanting to register to vote must also: (a) be of good character and able to pass a test on citizenship, (b) be able to read and write provisions of the U.S. and Georgia constitutions, or (c) own at least 40 acres of land or $500 in property. Any Georgian who had fought in any war from the American Revolution through the Spanish–American War was exempted from these additional qualifications. More importantly, any Georgian descended from a veteran of any of these wars also was exempted. Because by 1908 many white Georgia males were grandsons of veterans and/or owned the required property, the exemption and the property requirement basically allowed only well-to-do whites to vote. The qualifications of good character, citizenship knowledge, and literacy (all determined subjectively by white registrars), and property ownership were used to disqualify most blacks and poor whites, preventing them from registering to vote. The voter rolls dropped dramatically. In the early 20th century, Progressives promoted electoral reform and reducing the power of ward bosses to clean up politics. Their additional rules, such as the eight-box law, continued to effectively close out people who were illiterate. White, one-party rule was solidified.|$|E

500|$|Principal filming {{began the}} last week of August 1942. [...] The entire picture was filmed on a sound stage, with no {{location}} shooting. Hepburn had already begun her extramarital affair with Spencer Tracy, and the production was notorious for the ways in which Hepburn doted on Tracy. Tracy drank heavily during the shoot, and Hepburn was his constant guardian, nurse, maid, and gofer during this time. She tried to keep him out of the bars, assisted him when he was drunk, reinforced his ego, and ran lines with him. However, Hepburn continued to be upset by the script, and <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> problem by isolating herself from friends and family in order to concentrate on her interpretation of the role.|$|E

500|$|The Assembly resolved, {{after some}} debate, {{that all the}} doctrines of the Thirty-Nine {{articles}} {{would need to be}} proven from the Bible. Assembly members were prone to long speeches and they made slow progress, frustrating the leadership. The eighth of the Thirty-Nine Articles recommended the Apostles' Creed, Nicene Creed, and Athanasian Creed, considered to be basic statements of orthodoxy, to be received and believed. The Assembly was unable to resolve conflicts between those who would not be bound by creeds and those who wished to retain the existing language that the creeds be [...] "thoroughly received and believed".

500|$|For {{the most}} part, the long passage across the Weddell Sea {{proceeded}} uneventfully. There was a growing level of unrest among the crew, perhaps provoked by disappointment with the apparent aimlessness of the voyage; Worsley {{in particular was}} critical of Wild's leadership. Wild, in his own account, <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> discontent {{by the threat of}} [...] "the most drastic treatment". On 12 March they reached 64°11'S, 46°4'W, which was the area where Ross had recorded an [...] "Appearance of Land" [...] in 1842, {{but there was no sign}} of it, and a depth sounding of over 2,300fathoms (13,800ft, 4,200m.) indicated no likelihood of land nearby. Between 15–21 March Quest was frozen into the ice, and the shortage of coal became a major concern. Wild hoped that the diminished fuel supply could be supplemented by blubber from the seals at Elephant Island. On 25 March the island was sighted. Wild wanted if possible to revisit Cape Wild, the site of the old Endurance expedition camp, but bad weather prevented this. They viewed the site through binoculars, picking out the old landmarks, before landing on the western coast to hunt for elephant seals. They were able to obtain sufficient blubber to mix with the coal so that, aided by a favourable wind, they reached South Georgia on 6 April.|$|E
