50|$|<b>Glutaurine,</b> an {{endogenous}} compound (KEGG: C05844), {{has been}} noted as an antiepileptic, with antiamnesia properties. The dipeptide γ-glutamyltaurine (γ-GT; <b>glutaurine,</b> Litoralon) was discovered in the parathyroid in 1980, {{and later in the}} mammalian brain. This led to studies on intrinsic and synthetic taurine peptides, and the suggestion that γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT; γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase) in the brain is responsible for its in vivo formation.|$|E
