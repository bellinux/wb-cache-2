40|$|Abstract. We {{calculate}} the limiting gap {{distribution for the}} <b>fractional</b> <b>parts</b> of log n, where n runs through all positive integers. By rescaling the sequence, the proof quickly reduces to an argument used by Barra and Gaspard {{in the context of}} level spacing statistics for quantum graphs. The key ingredient is Weyl equidistribution of irrational translations on multi-dimensional tori. Our results extend to logarithms with arbitrary base; we deduce explicit formulas when the base is transcendental or the rth root of an integer. If the base is close to one, the gap distribution is close to the exponential distribution. § 1. The gap distribution is a popular measure to quantify the degree of randomness in a given deterministic sequence. Rudnick and Zaharescu have shown [12] that the gap distribution of the <b>fractional</b> <b>parts</b> of 2 nα (n = 1, [...] ., N), for almost all α, converges in the limit N → ∞ to an exponential distribution—the gap distribution of a Poisson point process. (2 n may be replaced by any lacunary sequence.) The same is expected to hold for the <b>fractional</b> <b>parts</b> of nkα, for any integer k ≥ 2 and α of bounded type, but this remains unproven [10, 11, 8, 4]. Numerical experiments also suggest that the <b>fractional</b> <b>parts</b> of nβ may have an exponential gap distribution provided β ∈ (0,...|$|R
