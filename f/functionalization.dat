We have considered different tube arrays, varying the spacing between them, as well as, different chemical <b>functionalizations</b> on the uncapped nanotubes.

25|$|Pyrroles react {{easily with}} nitrating (e.g. HNO3/Ac2O), sulfonating (Py·SO3), and halogenating (e.g. NCS, NBS, Br2, SO2Cl2, and KI/H2O2) agents. Halogenation {{generally}} provides polyhalogenated pyrroles, but monohalogenation can be performed. As is typical for electrophilic additions to pyrroles, halogenation generally {{occurs at the}} 2-position, but can also occur at the 3-position by silation of the nitrogen. This is a useful method for further <b>functionalization</b> of the generally less reactive 3-position.|$|E
25|$|Another {{application}} of patterned SAMs is the <b>functionalization</b> of biosensors. The tail groups {{can be modified}} so they have an affinity for cells, proteins, or molecules.

25|$|Many electrophilic substitutions on {{pyridine}} {{either do}} not proceed or proceed only partially; however, the heteroaromatic character can be activated by electron-donating <b>functionalization.</b> Common alkylations and acylations, such as Friedel–Crafts alkylation or acylation, usually fail for pyridine because they lead {{only to the}} addition at the nitrogen atom. Substitutions usually occur at the 3-position, {{which is the most}} electron-rich carbon atom in the ring and is, therefore, more susceptible to an electrophilic addition.|$|E

25|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} can be functionalized {{to attain}} desired properties {{that can be}} used in a wide variety of applications. The two main methods of carbon nanotube <b>functionalization</b> are covalent and non-covalent modifications. Because of their hydrophobic nature, carbon nanotubes tend to agglomerate hindering their dispersion in solvents or viscous polymer melts. The resulting nanotube bundles or aggregates reduce the mechanical performance of the final composite. The surface of the carbon nanotubes can be modified to reduce the hydrophobicity and improve interfacial adhesion to a bulk polymer through chemical attachment.|$|E
25|$|Janus {{particles}} are special types of nanoparticles whose surfaces {{have two or}} more distinct physical properties. This unique surface of Janus nanoparticles allows {{two different types of}} chemistry to occur on the same particle. The simplest case of a Janus nanoparticle is achieved by dividing the nanoparticle into two distinct parts, each of them either made of a different material, or bearing different functional groups. For example, a Janus nanoparticle may have one-half of its surface composed of hydrophilic groups and the other half hydrophobic groups. This gives these particles unique properties related to their asymmetric structure and/or <b>functionalization.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{asymmetric}} hydrogenation of aromatic (especially heteroaromatic), substrates is a {{very active}} field of ongoing research. Catalysts in this field must contend {{with a number of}} complicating factors, including the tendency of highly stable aromatic compounds to resist hydrogenation, the potential coordinating (and therefore catalyst-poisoning) abilities of both substrate and product, and the great diversity in substitution patterns that may be present on any one aromatic ring. Of these substrates the most consistent success has been seen with nitrogen-containing heterocycles, where the aromatic ring is often activated either by protonation or by further <b>functionalization</b> of the nitrogen (generally with an electron-withdrawing protecting group). Such strategies are less applicable to oxygen- and sulfur-containing heterocycles, since they are both less basic and less nucleophilic; this additional difficulty may help to explain why few effective methods exist for their asymmetric hydrogenation.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} common methods of {{antifouling}} comes from growing polymer chains from a surface, often by poly(ethylene glycol) or PEG. However, challenges exist in creating a functionalized surface to which PEG chains may be grown, especially in aqueous environments. Researchers {{have been able to}} study the methods by which the common blue mussel Mytilus edulis is able to adhere to solid surfaces in marine environments using mussel adhesive proteins, or MAPs. MAPs typically comprise several proteins, of which the most common repeating sequence is Ala-Lys-Pro-Ser-Tyr-trans-2,3-cis-3,4-dihydroxyproline (DHP) -Hyp-Thr-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) -Lys. The inclusion of the hydroxylated DHP and DOPA amino acids is thought to contribute to the adhesive nature of the MAPs. Recent studies have looked into using a short chain of DOPA residues as an adhesive end-group for antifouling PEG polymers which show promise in adsorbing onto certain metal surfaces. Increasing the number of DOPA residues to three greatly improves the total amount of adsorbed DOPA-PEG polymers and exhibits antifouling properties exceeding most other 'grafting-to' polymeric <b>functionalization</b> methods.|$|E
25|$|Metal-catalyzed C–H borylation {{reactions}} are transition metal catalyzed organic reactions that produce an organoboron compound through <b>functionalization</b> of aliphatic and aromatic C–H bonds {{and are therefore}} useful reactions for carbon–hydrogen bond activation. Metal-catalyzed C–H borylation reactions utilize transition metals to directly convert a C–H bond into a C–B bond. This route can be advantageous compared to traditional borylation reactions by making use of cheap and abundant hydrocarbon starting material, limiting prefunctionalized organic compounds, reducing toxic byproducts, and streamlining the synthesis of biologically important molecules. Boronic acids, and boronic esters are common boryl groups incorporated into organic molecules through borylation reactions. Boronic acids are trivalent boron-containing organic compounds that possess one alkyl substituent and two hydroxyl groups. Similarly, boronic esters possess one alkyl substituent and two ester groups. Boronic acids and esters are classified {{depending on the type}} of carbon group (R) directly bonded to boron, for example alkyl-, alkenyl-, alkynyl-, and aryl-boronic esters. The most common type of starting materials that incorporate boronic esters into organic compounds for transition metal catalyzed borylation reactions have the general formula (RO)2B-B(OR)2. For example, Bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2Pin2), and bis(catecholato)diborane (B2Cat2) are common boron sources of this general formula.|$|E
