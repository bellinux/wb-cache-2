5|$|The central scene, of God {{creating}} Eve <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> {{the sleeping}} Adam {{has been taken}} in its composition directly from another Creation sequence, the relief panels that surround {{the door of the}} Basilica of San Petronio, Bologna by Jacopo della Quercia whose work Michelangelo had studied in his youth.|$|E
5|$|After Hōshō was commissioned, {{experienced}} aircrews requested changes, and {{the ship}} was modified by the Yokosuka Navy Arsenal from 6 June to 20 August 1924. The island, tripod mast, and aircraft crane were removed since they partially obstructed the flight deck and obscured pilot visibility. The forward part of the flight deck was made horizontal, and the 8cm AA guns were moved forward, close {{to the position of}} the former island and {{out of the way of}} landing operations. After the island was removed, the carrier's flight operations were controlled from a platform extending <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the flight deck, a design that would be repeated in subsequent Japanese aircraft carriers. The ship was then assigned to the 1st Fleet until 15 November 1924.|$|E
5|$|With {{no time to}} make {{a coordinated}} plan of attack for the whole army, Khalid decided to storm the East Gate himself. He, Qa'qa ibn Amr, and Mazur ibn Adi climbed the wall hand-by-hand <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the gate. This part of the wall was the strongest, no guard was {{stationed}} at the top. They secured ropes to the wall and dropped them to 100 selected soldiers waiting at the base. Leaving a few men to assist the climbers, Khalid descended into the city, killing the guards at the inside of the East Gate. Khalid and Qa'qa flung the gate open and the remainder of Khalid's men entered the city. An intense battle ensued.|$|E

5|$|In November 2003, Irwin was {{filming a}} {{documentary}} on sea lions {{off the coast of}} Baja California Peninsula in Mexico when he heard via his boat's radio that two scuba divers were reported missing in the area. Irwin and his entire crew suspended operations to aid in the search. His team's divers searched with the rescue divers, and Irwin used his vessel to patrol the waters around the island where the incident occurred, as well as using his satellite communications system to call in a rescue plane. On {{the second day of the}} search, kayakers found one of the divers, Scott Jones, perched on a narrow rock ledge jutting out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a cliff. Irwin and a crew member escorted him to Irwin's boat. Jones did not recognise Irwin. The other lost diver, Katie Vrooman, was found dead by a search plane later the same day not far from Jones' location.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve carries {{lower motor neurons}} that synapse with upper motor neurons at the hypoglossal nucleus. Symptoms related to damage {{will depend on the}} position of damage in this pathway. If the damage is to the nerve itself (a lower motor neuron lesion), the tongue will curve toward the damaged side, owing to weakness of the genioglossus muscle of affected side. If the damage is to the nerve pathway (an upper motor neuron lesion) the tongue will curve away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> damage, due to action of the affected genioglossus muscle, and will occur without fasciculations or wasting, with speech difficulties more evident. Damage to the hypoglossal nucleus will lead to wasting of muscles of the tongue and deviation towards the affected side when it is stuck out. This is because of the weaker genioglossal muscle.|$|E
5|$|The naphtha cut, as that {{fraction}} is called, {{contains many}} different hydrocarbon compounds. Therefore, {{it has an}} initial boiling point of about 35°C and a final boiling point of about 200°C. Each cut produced in the fractionating columns has a different boiling range. At some distance below the overhead, the next cut is withdrawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the column and {{it is usually the}} jet fuel cut, also known as a kerosene cut. The boiling range of that cut is from an initial boiling point of about 150°C to a final boiling point of about 270°C, and it also contains many different hydrocarbons. The next cut further down the tower is the diesel oil cut with a boiling range from about 180°C to about 315°C. The boiling ranges between any cut and the next cut overlap because the distillation separations are not perfectly sharp. After these come the heavy fuel oil cuts and finally the bottoms product, with very wide boiling ranges. All these cuts are processed further in subsequent refining processes.|$|E

5|$|The {{race was}} {{restarted}} on lap 14, with Ambrose leading Denny Hamlin (both of whom {{opted not to}} pit) Almirola, Stewart and Jamie McMurray. Hamlin passed Ambrose {{to take the lead}} one lap later. Stewart, with aid from Burton, took over the lead from Hamlin one lap later. Hamlin reclaimed the lead on lap 17 and McDowell moved into second place. Hamlin continued to maintain his lead over the next four laps while McMurray battled with Stewart for second. McDowell had fallen to eighth by lap 21, while Stewart continued in second by lap 25. On the 28th lap, McMurray tried an overtake around the outside of Hamlin for the lead at turn three but could not complete the maneuver, causing him to drop to eighth two laps later. On lap 32, the top five were Hamlin, Stewart, Harvick, Stenhouse and Ambrose. As the cars ran in single file, Edwards had dropped to 15th place one lap later. McDowell was told by his team to save fuel on lap 43. Green flag pit stops began on lap 44 when Hamlin and Ambrose stopped for tyres and fuel, allowing Stewart to assume the lead with Kevin Harvick in second and Stenhouse in third. Eight laps later, after making a pit stop, Michael Waltrip lost control of his car on the backstraightaway after driving <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the track onto the race track, and crashed into the backstretch wall. The incident caused the second caution to be shown as every driver except Stewart, Harvick and Edwards stopped for fuel.|$|E
