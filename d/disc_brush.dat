40|$|A Faraday disc is a {{conducting}} disc that rotates in {{the magnetic}} field of a horseshoe magnet as shown in Figure 1. The free electrons in the disc experience a magnetic force, and a potential develops between the axis and {{the perimeter of the}} <b>disc.</b> If <b>brushes</b> are positioned at the center and the perimeter of the disc, this current can be observed using a galvanometer...|$|R
50|$|Angle {{grinders}} may be {{used for}} removing excess material from a piece. There are many different kinds of discs that are used for various materials and tasks, such as cut-off discs (diamond blade), abrasive grinding discs, grinding stones, sanding <b>discs,</b> wire <b>brush</b> wheels and polishing pads. The angle grinder has large bearings to counter side forces generated during cutting, unlike a power drill, where the force is axial.|$|R
5000|$|Oil removal flow rate: Alternative Skimmer designs have {{different}} oil removal flow rates. Volume removal rates for Oleophilic skimmer types (drum, <b>brush,</b> <b>disc,</b> belt) are comparatively low. Weir type skimmers {{are capable of}} very high oil and water removal rates. ASTM F2709 standard establishes the test procedure for determining oil recovery rate (ORR).|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: An {{example of}} a Western Electric 7A Rotary (Bird-cage) Line Finder assembly. The {{horizontal}} shaft is driven by a gear and when the Line Finder's electromagnet is energized, a flexible disc {{at the base of}} the Line Finder's brush carriage is engaged through friction to the horizontal shaft's driving <b>disc,</b> causing the <b>brush</b> carriage to rotate.|$|R
2500|$|One {{approach}} is to define the notion of [...] "rate of change of flux linkage" [...] by drawing a hypothetical line across the <b>disc</b> from the <b>brush</b> to the axle and asking how much flux linkage is swept past this line per unit time. See Figure 2. Assuming [...] a radius R for the disc, a sector of disc with central angle θ has an area: ...|$|R
25|$|The flux {{through the}} portion of the path from the brush at the rim, through the outside loop and the axle {{to the center of the}} disc is always zero because the {{magnetic}} field is in the plane of this path (not perpendicular to it), no matter what is rotating, so the integrated emf around this part of the path is always zero. Therefore, attention is focused on {{the portion of}} the path from the axle across the <b>disc</b> to the <b>brush</b> at the rim.|$|R

5000|$|After the presoak {{application}}, a {{car wash}} tunnel's layout can vary greatly. In some car washes, presoak application {{is followed by}} an empty space, or idle zone. This provides time for the presoak to loosen dirt on the car. In many cases, wheel cleaning equipment, such as sill brushes or high pressure wheel blasters, are placed in the idle zone. A sill brush (also known as a wheel brush or tire brush) consists of an 8-foot-long brush assembly which is pushed against the car's wheels and door sill area. Sill brushes are typically use flagged bristle, as dirt is usually most heavily concentrated on the lower parts of the car. The material on a sill brush may have alternating lengths or use material which is intentionally mounted off-center to allow wheel surfaces of various depths to be cleaned. Sill brushes rely on the rotation of a customer's car's wheels {{in order to achieve}} complete wheel contact. Similarly to the CTAs, wheel brushes often only activate when the customer buys a wheel cleaning upgrade. Some car washes use wheel-rim <b>disc</b> <b>brushes</b> in addition to or in place of sill brushes. These assemblies extend out towards the wheel and follow it at the same speed as the conveyor while rotating at high speeds to clean the wheels. These devices are popular in car washes that use belt conveyors, as a belt conveyor prevents the wheels of a customer's car from rotating and thus renders sill brushes useless for wheel cleaning. Some car washes feature multiple sets of wheel brushes and offer multiple levels of wheel cleaning. Tracking high pressure wheel blasters consist of assemblies with multiple nozzles that follow a car's wheel over a distance. While following a car's wheel, a wheel blaster directs high-pressure water at the wheel. The following motion may be achieved by having the nozzles pivot to face the wheel or by having the nozzles move alongside the car at the same speed as the conveyor. At the end of a car wash's presoak idle zone is often a high pressure arch. High pressure arches direct high pressure water at a vehicle's surface. This may be done [...] "V-jet" [...] nozzles, rotating [...] "turbo" [...] nozzles, spinning manifolds, and oscillating and/or pivoting manifolds. Some high pressure systems maintain a constant distance from the vehicle to provide more consistent results. Separate high pressure top, wheel, and/or side blasters may be present in place of or supplementary to a high pressure arch.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveDentine {{hypersensitivity}} is {{an increasing}} problem in dentistry. Several products are available that claim to occlude open dentine tubules and to reduce dentine hypersensitivity. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effectiveness of several different products on dentine tubule occlusion using qualitative and quantitative methods. Materials and methodsDentine discs were prepared from extracted human premolars and molars. The dentine <b>discs</b> were <b>brushed</b> with 6 different experimental toothpastes, 1 positive control toothpaste and 1 negative control without toothpaste; the brushing simulated a total brushing time of 1 year. Half of the discs were etched with lemon juice after toothpaste application. Standardized scanning electron microphotographs were taken and converted into binary black and white images. The black pixels, which represented the open dentine tubules, were counted and statistically evaluated. Then, half of the dentine discs were broken, and the occlusion of the dentine tubules was investigated using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). ResultsThe number of open dentine tubules decreased significantly after brushing with 5 of the 6 tested toothpastes. A significant effect was observed after acid erosion for 3 of the 6 tested toothpastes. EDS revealed partly closed dentine tubules after brushing with 3 toothpastes; however, no partly closed dentine tubules were observed after acid erosion. ConclusionsSome toothpastes are capable of partial dentine tubule occlusion. This occlusion is unstable and can be removed with acid erosion. Clinical significanceDesensitizing toothpastes are the most common products that are used against dentine hypersensitivity, and these toothpastes affect dentine tubule occlusion...|$|R
5000|$|Recording {{was done}} using a cutting lathe and acetate discs. Programs were {{normally}} recorded at 33 rpm on 16 inch discs, the standard format used for such [...] "electrical transcriptions" [...] {{from the early}} 1930s through the 1950s. Sometimes, the groove was cut starting at {{the inside of the}} disc and running to the outside. This was useful when the program to be recorded was longer than 15 minutes so required more than one disc side. By recording the first side outside in, the second inside out, and so on, the sound quality at the disc change-over points would match and result in a more seamless playback. An inside start also had the advantage that the thread of material cut from the disc's surface, which had to be kept out of the path of the cutting stylus, was naturally thrown {{toward the center of the}} disc so was automatically out of the way. When cutting an outside start <b>disc,</b> a <b>brush</b> could be used to keep it out of the way by sweeping it toward the middle of the disc. Well-equipped recording lathes used the vacuum from a water aspirator to pick it up as it was cut and deposit it in a water-filled bottle. In addition to convenience, this served a safety purpose, as the cellulose nitrate thread was highly flammable and a loose accumulation of it combusted violently if ignited.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{recommended}} that discs be cleaned before—and after—each playback, carbon-fibre brushes are quite effective. Records should be cleaned in a circular motion, {{in the direction of}} the grooves. Distilled water (not tap water as it will leave behind mineral deposits) and a soft, lint-free cloth is a common method of cleaning. Another method is to clean the LP on the turntable with a <b>disc</b> cleaning <b>brush</b> (the Discwasher system is frequently recommended by the audio press). A simple [...] "cleaning bath" [...] device called the Spin Clean gives good results, and there are also vacuum machines on the market such as the Nitty Gritty, Keith Monks, Clearaudio, and VPI, which are recommended for more a thorough cleaning. In recent years, ultrasonic cleaning machines from manufacturers such as Klaudio (Korea) and Audio Desk Systeme (Germany) have also been used with great success. The effectiveness of the ultrasonic machines coupled with their premium price tags (both $4,000 US in January 2015) has opened the door for companies to offer professional ultrasonic cleaning at an affordable cost of just a few dollars per record. Another cleaning product recently released called Record Revirginizer uses a polymer that is applied to record surface then left to dry, the polymer is then peeled from the surface taking the microscopic contaminants with it. Though in the past, using alcohol on vinyl LPs was considered safe, experts now caution against it unless absolutely necessary, as alcohol threatens the loss of the plasticizer or stabilizer. As vinyl is often prone to electrostatic charges that cause dust and debris to be attracted to its surface, anti-static products can be used if needed.|$|R
