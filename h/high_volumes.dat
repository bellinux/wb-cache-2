5|$|Die casting {{equipment}} {{was invented in}} 1838 {{for the purpose of}} producing movable type for the printing industry. The first die casting-related patent was granted in 1849 for a small hand-operated machine for the purpose of mechanized printing type production. In 1885 Otto Mergenthaler invented the linotype machine, an automated type-casting device which became the prominent type of equipment in the publishing industry. The Soss die-casting machine, manufactured in Brooklyn, NY, was the first machine to be sold in the open market in North America. Other applications grew rapidly, with die casting facilitating the growth of consumer goods and appliances by making affordable the production of intricate parts in <b>high</b> <b>volumes.</b> In 1966, General Motors released the Acurad process.|$|E

It is crucial to understand the underlying reasons as to why there is a disparity in utilization of <b>high</b> <b>volume</b> hospitals. However, the studies that investigated the mechanism underlying the disparity in <b>high</b> <b>volume</b> hospital utilization are very limited. The objectives of this study include: 1) {{examine the relationship between}} geographic differential distance and utilization of <b>high</b> <b>volume</b> hospitals; 2) investigate other demographic, socioeconomic and clinical factors that may affect patients 2 ̆ 7 utilization of <b>high</b> <b>volume</b> hospitals. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to evaluate factors that impact patients 2 ̆ 7 utilization of <b>high</b> <b>volume</b> hospitals. The study results showed that geographic distance is a significant factor that impedes patients 2 ̆ 7 utilization of <b>high</b> <b>volume</b> hospitals, independent of patients 2 ̆ 7 clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic characteristics. It was also found that white, non-Hispanic women, patients with higher education level {{are more likely to be}} admitted in <b>high</b> <b>volume</b> hospitals compared to low volume hospitals. These factors are also significant to patients 2 ̆ 7 choice of medium vs. low volume hospitals. Geographic proximity is an important factor that affects patients 2 ̆ 7 choice of hospital, and directing more patients to <b>high</b> <b>volume</b> hospitals should anticipate negative effects, such as increasing the cost of seeking care at <b>high</b> <b>volume</b> hospitals.

5|$|The {{idea of the}} M54 was {{originally}} presented due to the <b>high</b> <b>volumes</b> of traffic on the A5, London to Holyhead road which was largely constructed by civil engineer Thomas Telford in the early 19th century following {{the route of the}} Roman Watling Street, which connected Rochester, Kent with Wroxeter, Shropshire. The initial plan for a motorway following the M54's present route was therefore designed to alleviate the roads which handled the commercial traffic to the port of Holyhead, destined for Ireland. With the proposal in the early 1960s for a new town to provide an overspill housing area for the West Midlands conurbation, then named Dawley New Town (designated as Telford in 1967), the M54 was becoming more likely to be built; the government also wanted to increase transport provision to the rest of Shropshire.|$|E

This caused extra demand for CERs in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and CER prices exceeded $NZ25 a tonne, the effective price cap in the NZ ETS. NZ buyers switched from the more expensive CERS to cheaper NZUs which were traded at a record price of more than NZ$21 per tonne. In July 2011, concerns over the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis combined with the <b>high</b> <b>volumes</b> of CERS being issued caused international CER prices to fall to a range between 9 and 10 euros.

40|$|<b>High</b> <b>volume</b> fly ash {{concrete}} typically has around 50 % {{or more of}} {{the cement}} content of concrete replaced by fly ash. This material has potential to reduce the environmental impact associated with production of concrete. One constraint observed in <b>high</b> <b>volume</b> fly ash concrete is the slower strength gain leading to low 28 day compressive strengths compared to Portland cement concrete. Preliminary work at RMIT University has shown that use of ultrafine fly ash and lime water can improve the mechanical and material properties of <b>high</b> <b>volume</b> fly ash concrete. This paper presents an investigation on the effect of different concentrations of lime water as mixing water on mechanical properties of <b>high</b> <b>volume</b> fly ash concrete. Raw fly ash and ultra fine fly ash with different concentrations of lime water are used in making <b>high</b> <b>volume</b> fly ash concrete. Ultrafine fly ash is generated by grinding raw fly ash with a micronizer. Compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, flexural strength and drying shrinkage of <b>high</b> <b>volume</b> fly ash concrete are determined in the laboratory and the results are presented here.
