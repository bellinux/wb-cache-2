5|$|Barbera's <b>desk</b> <b>was</b> {{opposite}} that of William Hanna. The two {{quickly realized}} {{they would make}} a good team. By 1939, they had solidified a partnership that would last over 60 years. Barbera and Hanna worked alongside animator Tex Avery, who had created Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros. and directed Droopy cartoons at MGM.|$|E
5|$|It {{was written}} in the {{afternoon}} in the intervals of some other writing. The <b>desk</b> <b>was</b> in an upstairs room, by a window looking down a wooded hill. It {{was written in}} a little notebook in which his father and mother wrote out copies of several of their poems and, in most cases, added the date of composition. On one page the first two lines of 'Trees' appear, with the date, February 2, 1913, and on another page, further on in the book, is the full text of the poem. It was dedicated to his wife's mother, Mrs. Henry Mills Alden, who was endeared to all her family.|$|E
5|$|Kyoto held {{a year-long}} celebration commemorating the 1000th anniversary of Genji in 2008, with poetry competitions, {{visits to the}} Tale of Genji Museum in Uji and Ishiyama-dera (where a life size {{rendition}} of Murasaki at her <b>desk</b> <b>was</b> displayed), and women dressing in traditional 12-layered Heian court Jūnihitoe and ankle-length hair wigs. The author and her work inspired museum exhibits and Genji manga spin-offs. The design on the reverse of the first 2000 yen note commemorated her and The Tale of Genji. A plant bearing purple berries has been named after her.|$|E
50|$|Moore {{combination}} <b>desks</b> <b>were</b> {{produced in}} standard, extra, and superior grades. Standard grade combination <b>desks</b> <b>were</b> $110 to $185. Extra grade <b>desks</b> <b>were</b> 40% to 50% more expensive. Superior were more expensive.|$|R

25|$|In 1997, {{the candy}} <b>desk</b> <b>was</b> {{referenced}} by Kit Bond during {{a debate over}} the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998. He compared the sizes of microchips to candy he had taken from the desk.|$|E
25|$|Replicas of the Resolute desk have {{appeared}} in many movies. The <b>desk</b> <b>was</b> a key plot device in , in which a secret compartment in the desk contained pieces of {{a clue to the}} location of treasure. The film also features another desk made from HMS Resolute, situated in Buckingham Palace, which was made for the personal use of Queen Victoria.|$|E
25|$|Senators {{who have}} {{maintained}} the Candy Desk tradition include John McCain, Harrison Schmitt, and Rick Santorum, who stocked it with confectionery {{from his home}} state of Pennsylvania, including from the Hershey Chocolate Company. After Santorum left the Senate in 2007, the Candy <b>Desk</b> <b>was</b> maintained by a number of senators for a short time each, before Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey began his stay in 2015.|$|E
40|$|A {{guide for}} {{users of the}} Thermal Analyst's Help <b>Desk</b> <b>is</b> provided. Help <b>Desk</b> <b>is</b> an expert system that runs on a DOS based {{personal}} computer and operates within the EXSYS expert system shell. Help <b>Desk</b> <b>is</b> an analysis tool designed to provide users having various degrees of experience with the capability to determine first approximations of thermal capacity for spacecraft and instruments. The five analyses supported in Help Desk are: surface area required for a radiating surface, equilibrium temperature of a surface, enclosure temperature and heat loads for a defined position in orbit, enclosure temperature and heat loads over a complete orbit, and selection of appropriate surface properties. The two geometries supported by Help <b>Desk</b> <b>are</b> a single flat plate and a rectangular box enclosure...|$|R
50|$|A {{secretary}} <b>desk</b> <b>is,</b> {{despite its}} name, generally not {{used by a}} person with the title of secretary, since this kind of <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> an antique form which is now extremely rare in the modern office, where a secretary (frequently called an administrative assistant) normally works.|$|R
50|$|A field <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> a {{portable}} <b>desk</b> which <b>is</b> {{meant to be}} used in rear areas near a battlefield and moved around rather frequently in difficult conditions. It is in contrast to the campaign <b>desk,</b> which <b>is</b> usually heavier and meant for areas further in the rear.|$|R
25|$|His studio, at {{his home}} on the {{southern}} outskirts of Cologne, continued to be run by his widow Christa Fast and their son until her failing health and the general change {{in the music business}} forced them to offer its contents for sale in May 2006. She died on June 1, 2006. Conny's hand-built mixing <b>desk</b> <b>was</b> bought by English producer David M. Allen and transported to England and is installed in his Studio in London where it continues to make records.|$|E
25|$|Windmill Broadcasting {{started as}} Stafford Radio on 11 December 2011, the station having decided {{a year earlier}} that the Broad Eye Windmill was a perfect {{location}} for a radio station. In preparation to start broadcasting, in studio one, a specially made curved <b>desk</b> <b>was</b> made for the presenters, which fitted around the building's curved interior. As well as this, partitioned walls were put up to create a studio space, and carpet tiles were fitted to the wall to make the studio more sound proof.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, Tandy {{was working}} on his fencing foil, with the handle held in a vice. Although there was nothing touching it, the blade started to vibrate wildly. Further investigation led Tandy {{to discover that the}} extractor fan in the lab was emitting a frequency of 18.98Hz, very close to the resonant frequency of the eye given as 18Hz by NASA. This, Tandy conjectured, was why he had seen a ghostly figure—it was, he believed, an optical illusion caused by his eyeballs resonating. The room was exactly half a wavelength in length, and the <b>desk</b> <b>was</b> in the centre, thus causing a standing wave which caused the vibration of the foil.|$|E
50|$|The {{communications}} <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> now holographic in nature.|$|R
5000|$|In homes, {{the term}} [...] "student desk" [...] designates a small {{pedestal}} desk or writing table constructed {{for use by}} a teenager or a pre-teen in their room. It often <b>is</b> a pedestal <b>desk,</b> with {{only one of the}} two pedestals and about two thirds of the desk surface. Such <b>desks</b> <b>are</b> sometimes called [...] "left-pedestal desks" [...] and [...] "right-pedestal desks", depending on the position of the single pedestal. These <b>desks</b> <b>are</b> not as tall as normal adult desks. In some cases, the <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> connected from the seat to the table.|$|R
50|$|The slant top <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> {{a direct}} {{morphological}} descendant. In a sense the Spanish Bargueño (or Vargueño) <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> a distant {{cousin of the}} two piece version, since the Bargueño is also {{made up of a}} portable desk and a stand constructed specially for it, using the same materials and style.|$|R
500|$|Despite these rewrites, 20th Century Fox did {{not express}} {{confidence}} in financing a science-fiction film. However, after {{the success of}} Star Wars in 1977 the studio's interest in the genre rose substantially. According to Carroll: [...] "When Star Wars came out and was the extraordinary hit that it was, suddenly science fiction became the hot genre." [...] O'Bannon recalled that [...] "They wanted {{to follow through on}} Star Wars, and they wanted to follow through fast, and the only spaceship script they had sitting on their <b>desk</b> <b>was</b> Alien". Alien was greenlit by 20th Century Fox, with an initial budget of $4.2million. Alien was funded by North Americans, but made by 20th Century-Fox's British production subsidiary.|$|E
500|$|The {{leaders were}} joined by {{advisers}} after lunch, and hours were spent on long discussions of each clause of the [...] "Italian" [...] draft agreement. Late that evening the British and French left for their hotels, saying {{that they had to}} seek advice from their respective capitals. Meanwhile, the Germans and Italians enjoyed the feast which Hitler had intended for all the participants. During this break, Chamberlain adviser Sir Horace Wilson met with the Czechoslovaks; he informed them of the draft agreement and asked which districts were particularly important to them. The conference resumed at about 10pm and was mostly {{in the hands of a}} small drafting committee. At 1:30am the Munich Agreement was ready for signing, though the signing ceremony was delayed when Hitler discovered that the ornate inkwell on his <b>desk</b> <b>was</b> empty.|$|E
500|$|In 1852, Edward Belcher {{was given}} {{command of the}} {{government}} Arctic expedition in search of Sir John Franklin. This was unsuccessful; Belcher's inability to render himself popular with his subordinates was peculiarly unfortunate in an Arctic voyage, {{and he was not}} wholly suited to command vessels among ice. Four of the five ships ( [...] , Pioneer, [...] and Intrepid) were abandoned in pack ice, for which Belcher was court-martialed but acquitted. One of those ships, HMS Resolute, was later recovered intact by an American whaler and returned to the United Kingdom. Timbers from the ship were later used to manufacture three desks, one of which, the Resolute <b>desk,</b> <b>was</b> presented by Queen Victoria to the U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes; it has often been chosen by presidents for use in the Oval Office in the White House.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cylinder}} <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> a <b>desk</b> {{that resembles}} a Bureau Mazarin or a writing table equipped with small stacked shelves {{in front of the}} user's main work surface, and a revolving cylinder part that comes down to hide and lock up the working papers when the <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> not in use.|$|R

5000|$|He writes {{his films}} on a {{custom-built}} desk, crafted from Bastogne walnut, an extremely valuable wood. Within the <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> a wooden pipe organ, which {{plays with the}} opening of its drawers. David Blaine commented, “The <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> a very cool thing that’s a lot like Darren himself—there’s always another twist and turn.” ...|$|R
500|$|The {{story was}} an embarrassment for Trueblood and the university. In his memoirs, Handy {{recalled}} being summoned to Trueblood's office: [...] "His <b>desk</b> <b>was</b> {{piled high with}} letters...and clippings...from around the country...and {{he also had a}} copy of the McCutcheon cartoon. (He) was taking all of this as ridicule, although I had publicized the story with sincere enthusiasm for a new advance in education of which I felt the University of Michigan should be proud." [...] The faculty voted unanimously to suspend Handy for a year for [...] "publishing false and injurious statements affecting the character of the work of one of the Professors." [...] In addition to the suspension, Handy was charged as a [...] "faker" [...] in the press: Henry J. Handy, the student-correspondent at the University of Michigan who sent a sensational story to the Chicago newspapers, relating how Professor Thomas C. Trueblood had a class in love-making, has been suspended for one year and the story has been branded as a 'fake.' [...] Handy based the story on an incident that occurred during the rehearsal of a drama, when Professor Trueblood showed one of the students how to kneel to propose.|$|E
500|$|Former Pakistani Army Chief, General Ziauddin Butt {{has said}} that, {{according}} to his knowledge, Osama bin Laden was kept in an Intelligence Bureau safe house in Abbottabad by the then Director-General of the Intelligence Bureau of Pakistan (2004–2008), Brigadier Ijaz Shah. This had occurred with the [...] "full knowledge" [...] of former army chief General Pervez Musharraf and possibly that of current Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Emails from the private American security firm, Stratfor, published by WikiLeaks on February 27, 2012, indicate that up to 12 officials in Pakistan's ISI knew of Osama bin Laden's Abbottabad safe house. Stratfor had been given access to the papers collected by American forces from bin Laden's Abbottabad house. The emails reveal that these Pakistani officers included [...] "Mid to senior level ISI and Pak Mil with one retired Pak Mil General". In 2014, British journalist Carlotta Gall revealed {{that she had been}} told by an undisclosed ISI source that the ISI [...] "ran a special desk assigned to handle bin Laden". The <b>desk</b> <b>was</b> [...] "led by an officer who made his own decisions and did not report to a superior", … [...] "but the top military bosses knew about it, I was told".|$|E
500|$|The episode debuted {{the series}} as a midseason {{replacement}} for the 2004–05 season. The pilot is a direct adaptation of the first episode of the British version. Daniels had decided {{to go through this}} route because [...] "completely starting from scratch would be a very risky thing to do" [...] due to the show being an adaptation. Although the episode was primarily adapted from the first episode of the British series, it was partially re-scripted in an attempt to [...] "Americanize" [...] it. [...] Jokes such as Dwight's stapler being put in Jell-O by Jim were transferred verbatim from the original series, while others were only slightly changed. [...] Although later reshot, a scene in which Jim tapes pencils to his <b>desk</b> <b>was</b> originally filmed as a parallel to a scene in the British version, in which Tim Canterbury stacks up cardboard boxes in front of Gareth Keenan to restrict Keenan's view of Canterbury. [...] "Pilot" [...] was filmed almost six months prior to beginning of filming on the second episode of the season, [...] "Diversity Day". The Office used no laugh tracks in the [...] "Pilot", wanting its [...] "deadpan" [...] and [...] "absurd" [...] humor to fully come across.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ergonomic}} <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> {{a modern}} <b>desk</b> form which, like the adjustable drawing table or drafting table, offers mechanical adjustments for {{the placement of}} its elements {{in order to maximize}} user comfort and efficiency. The ergonomic <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> usually a [...] "stand-alone" [...] piece of furniture allowing access to the adjustment mechanisms. Some ergonomic desks have a sufficiently large desktop height adjustment to create either a common [...] "sit-down" [...] desk or a less common standing desk, which allows the user to work while standing. The ergonomic <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> usually a close companion to the ergonomic chair.|$|R

2500|$|His {{office at}} WQED Pittsburgh famously {{did not have}} a desk, only a sofa and armchairs, because Rogers thought a <b>desk</b> <b>was</b> [...] "too much of a barrier".|$|E
2500|$|The <b>desk</b> <b>was</b> {{removed from}} the White House only once, after the 1963 {{assassination}} of President Kennedy, when President Lyndon Johnson allowed it {{to go on a}} traveling exhibition with the Kennedy Presidential Library. After this it was on display in the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reception}} pavilion {{received a}} complete overhaul. Its exterior metal façade of bronzed aluminum was removed {{and replaced with}} beige limestone. The glass curtain wall received new mechanical louvers. The interior wall coverings of dark wood paneling and bronzed aluminum were replaced with a cream-colored travertine wainscoting topped by a band of polished stone. Fabric covered the walls above the band, and white wooden grills were used to help break up the space. A new terrazzo floor in pastel colors was also installed. The old reception <b>desk</b> <b>was</b> removed, and a new, curvilinear reception <b>desk</b> <b>was</b> emplaced. Displays about where to eat, drink, and shop in downtown Cleveland {{were added to the}} lobby, as were several kiosks where airlines could assist convention-goers in making plane reservations. Six [...] trees were planted inside the lobby to make it more inviting, and new paving and exterior lighting were installed outside the pavilion.|$|E
50|$|A spinet <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> {{an antique}} <b>desk</b> with an {{exterior}} shape {{similar to a}} writing table, But slightly higher and is fitted with a single drawer under the whole length of the flat top surface. The spinet <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> so named because when closed it resembles a spinet, a musical instrument of the harpsichord family.|$|R
50|$|The modern trestle <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> {{not so much}} a desk form as a desk improvisation. In {{shape and}} {{manufacture}} it sometimes resembles certain variations of the antique field <b>desk</b> which <b>was</b> used by officers not too far from the battlefield. Basically, the modern trestle <b>desk</b> improv <b>is</b> a plank of wood set on two trestles.|$|R
50|$|Some desks {{have the}} form of a table, {{although}} usually only one side of a <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> suitable to sit at (there are some exceptions, such as a partners desk), unlike most usual tables. Some desks do not have {{the form of}} a table, for instance, an armoire <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> a <b>desk</b> built within a large wardrobe-like cabinet, and a portable <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> light enough to be placed on a person's lap. Since many people lean on a desk while using it, a <b>desk</b> must <b>be</b> sturdy. In most cases, people sit at a desk, either on a separate chair or a built-in chair (e.g., in some school desks). Some users stand at their desks using higher standing vibrant desks.|$|R
