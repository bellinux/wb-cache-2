When the stimuli presented to the test ear stimulates the cochlea of the non-test ear, {{this is known as}} cross hearing. Whenever it is suspected that cross hearing has occurred it is best to use masking. This is done by temporarily elevating the threshold of the non-test ear, by presenting a masking noise at a predetermined level. This prevents the non-test ear from detecting the test signal presented to the test ear. The threshold of the test ear is measured {{at the same time as}} presenting the masking noise to the non-test ear. Thus, thresholds obtained when masking has been applied, provide an accurate representation of the true <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>level</b> of the test ear.|$|E

This study {{examined}} the relative contribution of genetic and environmental effects on the air-conducted <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>level</b> (0. 5 – 4 kHz) and speech recognition threshold level of the better ear as well as self-reported hearing in older women. Methods. Hearing was measured {{as a part of}} the Finnish Twin Study on Aging in 103 monozygotic (MZ) and 114 dizygotic (DZ) female twin pairs aged 63 – 76 years. Audiometric measured hearing was tested using standardized methods in soundproof conditions. Self-reported hearing was assessed by a structured question. Quantitative genetic modeling was used for data analyses. Results. No significant differences in age, exposure to noise, hearing-aid use, auditory diseases or accidents, or number of self-reported chronic conditions or prescription medicines were observed between the MZ and DZ twins. A genetic component in common accounted for 75 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 67 %– 81 %) of the variance in the better ear’s <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>level</b> and 54 % (95 % CI, 43 %– 64 %) in the better ear’s speech recognition threshold level, according to a bivariate genetic analysis.

40|$|Introduction The {{occurrence}} of occupational noise-induced hearing loss has doubled from 120 million to 250 {{million in a}} decade. Countries such as Malaysia, India and the US are adopting 90 dBA as the permissible exposure limit. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effectiveness of applying 85 and 90 dBA in preserving <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> and preventing the development of temporary threshold shifts. Methodology In this intervention study, 203 participants from two factories in an automobile industry were exposed to noise levels above the action level of 85 dBA in Factory 1 and 80 dBA in Factory 2, where the permissible exposure limits were 90 and 85 dBA, respectively. The exchange rate of 5 -dB was used in both study locations. Noise levels were measured using personal exposure noise dosimeters and a sound <b>level</b> meter. The <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> were measured at baseline and then followed up at the first month (post-shift exposure) and again, at the sixth month (pre-shift exposure). Data on <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> were measured using a manual audiometer. Hearing protection devices with appropriate noise reduction rate were used to reduce noise exposure among participants. The data analysis was carried out using SPSS version 20. 0 for Windows. Data for participants were then imputed as per-protocol analysis and based on the intention-to-treat principle. Independent t-tests, Chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact tests, McNemar’s and repeated measures ANOVA were used in the statistical analysis. iv Results As per-protocol analysis, mean <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> on right ear of participants at 3000 and 4000 Hz were statistically significantly lower in Factory 2 with exposure limit at 85 dBA compared to Factory 1 at 90 dBA, (3. 17; 95...|$|R
40|$|Background. Plasmodium falciparum malaria, as well {{as certain}} {{antimalarial}} drugs, is associated with hearing impairment in adults. There is little information, however, on the extent, if any, of this effect in children, and the evidence linking artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) with hearing is inconclusive. Methods. Audiometry was conducted in children with uncomplicated malaria treated with artesunate-amodiaquine (n= 37), artemether-lumefantrine (n= 35), or amodiaquine (n= 8) in Accra, Ghana. Audiometry was repeated 3, 7, and 28 days later and after 9 months. Audiometric thresholds were {{compared with those of}} a control group of children (n= 57) from the same area. Findings. During the acute stage, <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> of treated children were significantly elevated compared with controls (P< 0. 001). The threshold elevations persisted up to 28 days, but no differences in <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> were evident between treated children and controls after 9 months. The <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> of children treated with the two ACT regimens were comparable but lower than those of amodiaquine-treated children during acute illness. Interpretation.

Based on the average of the frequencies 0. 5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz, ? 1 % of the general UK population aged 18 – 80 years have an asymmetry of 15 dB or more. The prevalence is greater in older than in younger people. Conclusions: Inter-aural threshold differences greater than attributable to measurement error are not uncommon in the adult population, even after screening for conductive hearing loss and substantial noise exposure.

40|$|Noise {{exposure}} {{is one of}} the most prevalent causes of irreversible occupational disease in Sweden and in many other countries. In hearing conservation programs, aimed at preventing noise-induced hearing loss, audiometry is an important instrument to highlight the risks and to assess the effectiveness of the program. A hazardous working environment and persons affected by it can be identified by monitoring the <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> of individual employees or groups of employees over time. However, in order to evaluate the prevalence of occupational noise-induced hearing loss, relevant reference data of unexposed subjects is needed. The first part of this dissertation concerns the changes in <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> over three decades in two occupational environments with high noise levels in the province of Östergötland, Sweden: the mechanical and the wood processing industries. The results show a positive trend, with improving median <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> from the 1970 s into the 1990 s. However, the hearing loss present also in the best period, during the 1990 s, was probably greater than if the occupational noise exposure had not occurred. This study made clear the need for a valid reference data base, representing the statistical distribution of <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> in a population not exposed to occupational noise but otherwise comparable to the group under study. In the second part of the dissertation, reference data for <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> in women and men aged from 20 to 79 years are presented, based on measurements of 603 randomly selected individuals in Östergötland. A mathematical model is introduced, based on the hyperbolic tangent function, describing the <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> as functions of age. The results show an age-related gender difference, with poorer hearing for men in age groups above 50 years. The prevalence of different degree of hearing loss and tinnitus is described for the same population in the third part of the dissertation. The overall prevalence of mild, moderate, severe or profound hearing loss was 20. 9 % collectively for women and 25. 0 % collectively for men. Tinnitus was reported by 8. 9 % of the women and 17. 6 % of the men. Approximately 2. 4 % of the subjects under study had been provided with hearing aids. However, about 7. 7 % were estimated to potentially benefit from hearing aids as estimated from their degree of hearing loss. Noise-induced hearing loss primarily causes damage to the outer hair cells of the inner ear. The fourth and last part of the dissertation evaluates the outer hair cell function, using otoacoustic emission measurements (OAE). Prevalence results from three different measuring techniques are presented: spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAE), transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). Gender and age effects on the recorded emission levels were also investigated. Women showed higher emission levels compared to men and for both women and men the emission levels decreased with increasing age. The results from the OAE recordings were shown to be somewhat affected by the state of the middle ear. The study included tympanometry, and the relation of the outcome ofthis test to the otoacoustic emissions is described, where high middle ear compliance resulted in low emission level. Reference data for the tympanometric measurements are also presented. The results of this project form an essential part of the important work against noiseinduced hearing loss, which needs continuous monitoring. The reference data presented here will provide a valid and reliable data base for the future assessment of hearing tests performed by occupational health centres in Sweden. This data base will in turn prove useful for comparison studies for Sweden as a responsible fellow EU member country setting high standards for work force safety.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} auditory {{functions in}} children at {{schools for the}} deaf in Turkey. DESIGN: A total of 218 children who were attending the school for deaf children {{were involved in the}} study. Familial and medical histories were obtained, and otoscopic examinations were performed. Immittance audiometry, acoustic reflex testing, pure tone audiometry, otoacoustic emission and auditory brain stem response tests were performed. RESULTS: The mean age of identification of hearing loss was 48 months. Impacted wax was the most common otoscopic finding that was seen in 49 (22. 47 %) of children. Nontype-A tympanograms were found in 18 (8. 25 %) of children. One-hundred-eighty-nine (86. 69 %) children had profound hearing loss, and 29 (10. 3 %) had severe hearing loss on pure tone audiometry. On auditory brain stem response testing, 192 (88. 07 %) children had profound hearing loss, and 26 (11. 41 %) had severe hearing loss. Only one child had auditory neuropathy/dys-synchrony, as his otoacoustic emission results were normal without synchronous auditory brain stem responses. The <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> were found > 105 dB in 28 children only with pure tone audiometry. CONCLUSION: Early auditory screening is necessary to identify the children at risk. All hearing disorders cannot be detected by subjective or objective audiometric tests only. Pure tone audiometry still has a role in determining <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>levels.</b> The audiological research directions should be directed towards routine pure tone audiometry, otoacoustic emission and auditory brain stem response assessment for all hearing impaired children to enable an successful treatment...|$|R

Methods: A descriptive, quantitative, cross-sectional study carried out at NAMI in Fortaleza University, on 2006. Forty six children joined in the study, of whom 30 children with CH receiving hormonal replacement therapy with levothyroxine and 16 healthy children consisting of control group (CG). All the children had an auditory evaluation. The control group children were submitted to a TSH and free T 4 level. Medical records were analyzed to determine the TSH and free T 4 level, {{the beginning and the}} follow-up for children with CH. Results: Female gender prevailed in both groups, CH and CG, 23 (76. 7 %) and 9 (56. 3 %) children, respectively. The age group of the children with CH ranged from 3 months to 8 years old and the age group of the children from CG ranged from 4 months to 5. 6 years old. The average for the beginning of the therapy with levothyroxine in CH children was 135. 43 ± 325. 58 days. The other auditory tests were within the normal range and no statistically significant difference was found between the groups. Conclusions: Children with CH didn’t show any alteration in <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>levels.</b> They were first submitted to an auditory exam very late and the average time to start the therapy for CH was 4. 5 months.

Automated OAE testing of both ears was quickest (median 12. 5 minutes) and least invasive (no scalp electrodes). Bilateral failure rates (and upper 95 % confidence limits) with a stimulus 35 - 36 dB above normal <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>level</b> (nHL) were 3. 0 % (4. 6) with automated OAE, 3. 2 % (5. 1) with ABR, and 2. 7 % (4. 4) with automated ABR.

While {{there have been}} studies of bilateral auditory deprivation and later hearing restoration (e. g. cochlear implants), less is known about unilateral auditory deprivation and subsequent hearing improvement. We investigated effects of long-term congenital unilateral hearing loss on localization, speech understanding, and cortical organization following hearing recovery. Hearing in the congenitally affected ear of a 41 year old female improved significantly after stapedotomy and reconstruction. Pre-operative <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> showed unilateral, mixed, moderately-severe to profound hearing loss. The contralateral ear had <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> within normal limits. Testing was completed prior to, and three and nine months after surgery.

We also evoked magnetic resonance signals with monaural stimulation to the unaffected ear. Activation magnitudes were determined in core, belt, and parabelt auditory cortex regions via an interrupted single event design. Hearing improvement following 40 years of congenital unilateral hearing loss resulted in substantially improved sound localization and speech recognition in noise. Auditory cortex also reorganized. Contralateral auditory cortex responses were increased after hearing recovery {{and the extent of}} activated cortex was bilateral, including a greater portion of the posterior superior temporal plane. Thus, prolonged predominant monaural stimulation did not prevent auditory system changes consequent to restored binaural hearing.

Day care workers had the highest daily exposures, and flight technicians had the highest weekly exposures. Most daily and weekly exposures exceeded the 70 dBA exposure limit recommended for prevention of any hearing loss. Subjects′ perceptions of their exposures generally agreed well with measured noise levels. Among office workers, exposures were predominately nonoccupational, while among flight technicians nonoccupational and occupational activities contributed roughly equally, and among day care workers occupational exposures were dominant. Extreme exposures and cumulative noise exposure were associated with an increased risk of <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> > 10 dB hearing level. Effective hearing loss prevention programs may be needed in occupations not historically considered to be at high risk of noise-induced hearing loss (e. g., day care workers). Prevention efforts need to address nonoccupational exposures as well as occupational exposures, as nonoccupational activities may present the dominant risk of noise-induced hearing loss for some workers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{examination}} of the relationship between self-reported historical noise exposure during leisure activities and audiological indicators: Measured <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> (HTLs) and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). The research was conducted by a cross-sectional survey of 1, 432 individuals whose ages ranged from 11 years to 35 years. Methodology included a comprehensive audiometric assessment including otoscopy, pure tone audiometry (PTA) (air- and bone-conduction), OAEs, and tympanometry. A comprehensive questionnaire gathered information on demographics, hearing health status, and participation in work, nonwork, and leisure activities. Using the history of work, nonwork, and leisure noise exposure, a cumulative lifetime noise exposure was estimated. No correlation was found between cumulative lifetime noise exposure and audiometric PTA or OAE parameters...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo {{assess the}} {{collective}} hearing hazard entailed by occupational noise exposure. MethodsThe Late Audio-Sonometric Index (LASI) {{is a global}} score recommended for following up hearing loss in groups of workers exposed to traumatic noise, combining: daily noise exposure level (LEX, 8 h in dB(A)); individual <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>level</b> at 3 kHz (HTL 3 kHz in dB); HTL 0 3 kHz targeted at retirement; and 5 (or 10) years age bracket between 50 and 59 years of age. LASI=HTL 0 3 kHz – HTL 3 kHz+ 10 log (age –  20)  –  10 log (0. 23 ×LEX, 8 h –  17. 36). ResultsWhen LEX, 8 h exceeds 80 dB(A) and HTL 0 3 kHz is at 25 dB, occasional audiometric surveillance may be recommended for workers exposed to hazardous impulse noise: e. g., should the median and the mean LASI values fall below 20 for men or 23 for women (indicative threshold values). ConclusionThis exponential model thus integrates the fact that daily exposure to impulse noise may be more harmful for hearing than eight hours exposure to continuous noise of equivalent energy...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} ossicular motion {{produced}} by bone-conducted (BC) sound in live human ears. Laser Doppler Vibrometry {{was used to}} measure air conduction (AC) - and BC-induced umbo velocity (V(U)) in both ears of 10 subjects, 20 ears total. Sound pressure in the ear canal (P(EC)) was measured simultaneously. For air conduction, V(U) at standard <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>level</b> was calculated. For BC, ΔV was defined as the difference between V(U) and the tympanic ring velocity (an estimate of the skull velocity measured in the ear canal). ΔV and P(EC) at BC standard hearing threshold were calculated. ΔV at standard BC threshold was significantly smaller than V(U) at standard AC threshold between 500  Hz and 2000  Hz. Ear canal pressure at BC threshold tended to be smaller than for AC below 3000  Hz (with significant differences at 1000  Hz and 2000  Hz). Our results are most consistent with inertia of the ossicles and cochlear fluid driving BC hearing below 500  Hz, but with other mechanisms playing a significant role at higher frequencies. Sound radiated into the external ear canal might contribute to BC hearing at 3000  Hz and above...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe aim of {{this report}} is threefold: 1. First, we {{accomplish}} a survey integrating the description of consciousness, perception, and memory according to the views of descriptions of Hermann Helmholtz, Sigmund Freud, Henri Bergson, and Gustav Jung. 2. In the second step, we present experimental results for defining the machineries of sensation and perception: (a) electrical responses of isolated ganglion of Helix pomatia were measured upon odor stimuli that elicited varied degrees of responses. Such a model may give {{an idea of the}} control of sensation in the preconscious state of a living tissue. (b) We also describe experiments at the human <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>level.</b> (c) Further, the omission of working memory will be shown with the attenuation of delta response in Alzheimer’s subjects in P 300 measurements. (d) Finally, the measurement of auditory evoked potentials during slow-wave sleep in the cat brain explains the auditory responses that are not heard at this level of consciousness. 3. In the third step, we aim to provide a synopsis related to integration of perception, memory, and consciousness. By using concepts of important scientists as S. Freud on consciousness, we also tentatively discuss the boundaries of the transition of unconsciousness states to conscious states...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} noise-induced {{hearing loss}} among workers of a printing industry in Lagos metropolis, the commercial hub of Nigeria A total sample {{of one hundred}} and ninety-six (196) workers matched for age was randomly selected for this study.

40|$|The main {{goals of}} this thesis are: &# 149; To {{investigate}} {{the survival of}} adult human olfactory stem cells xenotransplanted into a mouse model of early-onset hearing loss (A/J mice). &# 149; To evaluate {{the ability of the}} stem cells to rescue hearing in early-onset progressive sensorineural hearing loss. The main results of this thesis are: &# 149; Xenotransplanted adult human olfactory stem cells survived for 4 weeks after the surgery (end point of the study). &# 149; The stem cells were mainly found in perilymphatic compartments of the cochlea (scala vestibuli and scala tympani) while only a few stem cells were present in scala media. &# 149; The stem cells did not integrate into cochlear tissues. &# 149; Post-surgery <b>hearing</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> in stem cell-transplanted mice were found to be significantly lower than <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> of sham-injected mice (P <. 05) for both click and pure tone stimuli. In addition, the threshold shift (difference between pre and post-surgery <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds)</b> was significantly less in the stem cell transplanted animals than the sham-injected animals for click stimulus. Overall, adult human olfactory stem cell transplantation can help preserve hearing during early-onset sensorineural hearing loss. This improvement in hearing could be due to paracrine effect of adult human olfactory stem cells...|$|R
