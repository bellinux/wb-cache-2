The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier and can be found at: [URL] and aqueous phase Al species are recognized to affect organic matter (OM) stabilization in forest soils. However, {{little is known about the}} dynamics of formation, composition and dissolution of organo-Al hydroxide complexes in microbially-active soil systems, where plant litter is subject to microbial decomposition in close proximity to mineral weathering reactions. We incubated gibbsite-quartz mineral mixtures in the presence of forest floor material inoculated with a native microbial consortium for periods of 5, 60 and 154 days. At each time step, samples were density separated into light (2. 0 g cm⁻³) fractions. The light fraction was mainly comprised of particulate organic matter, while the intermediate and heavy density fractions contained moderate and large amounts of Al-minerals, respectively. Multi-method interrogation of the <b>fractions</b> indicated the <b>intermediate</b> and heavy <b>fractions</b> differed both in mineral structure and organic compound composition. X-ray diffraction analysis and SEM/EDS of the mineral component of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>fractions</b> indicated some alteration of the original gibbsite structure into less crystalline Al hydroxide and possibly proto-imogolite species, whereas alteration of the gibbsite structure was not evident in the heavy fraction. DRIFT, Py-GC/MS and STXM/NEXAFS results all showed that <b>intermediate</b> <b>fractions</b> were composed mostly of lignin-derived compounds, phenolics, and polysaccharides. Heavy fraction organics were dominated by polysaccharides, and were enriched in proteins, N-bearing compounds, and lipids. The source of organics appeared to differ between the <b>intermediate</b> and heavy <b>fractions.</b> Heavy fractions were enriched in ¹³C with lower C/N ratios relative to <b>intermediate</b> <b>fractions,</b> suggesting a microbial origin. The observed differential fractionation of organics among hydroxy-Al mineral types suggests that microbial activity superimposed with abiotic mineral-surface-mediated fractionation leads to strong density differentiation of organo-mineral complex composition even over the short time scales probed in these incubation experiments. The data highlight the strong interdependency of mineral transformation, microbial community activity, and organic matter stabilization during biodegradation. Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Samples of {{inedible}} bulk mutton tallow {{were collected}} monthly throughout two killing seasons from one meat killing plant. These samples plus one sample from another plant, were analysed for fatty acid and triglyceride composition. In these samples, four fatty acids (myristic (14 : 0), palmitic (16 : 0), stearic (18 : 0) and oleic (18 : 1)) comprised 88. 6 % {{of the total}} fatty acids, {{and there was an}} average of 16 % trisaturated triglycerides, 38 % disaturated triglycerides and 46 % of triglycerides with a greater degree of unsaturation. Overall, there was a significant decrease in the proportion of 14 : 0, and {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of 18 : 0, from November to June; and there was a significant difference in the mean proportion of 16 : 0, and also 18 : 1, between the two seasons. There was a significant difference in the proportion of cis monounsaturated triglycerides, and the more highly unsaturated triglycerides, between some of the different tallows analysed. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of 2 -oleo disaturated triglycerides from November to June, with a range from 10. 0 % (May, 1978) to 20. 5 % (November, 1976). An acetone fractionation scheme was developed with the main aim of concentrating these 2 -oleo disaturated triglycerides into one fraction (the <b>intermediate</b> <b>fraction)</b> which may be useful as a cocoa butter replacer. The first precipitate (the hard fraction was separated by filtration, and the filtrate was adjusted for solvent : fat ratio and then further cooled to precipitate the <b>intermediate</b> <b>fraction.</b> After separation of this precipitate, acetone was distilled from the filtrate to produce a final fraction (the soft fraction). A screening experiment showed that the solvent : fat ratio at each crystallisation, the temperature to which the fat solution was cooled at each crystallisation, the water content of the acetone and the degree of agitation during crystallisation all affected the fractionation. The effect of these variables upon one sample of mutton tallow was studied, and mathematical models were developed to predict the yields of the three fractions and the melting properties of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>fraction,</b> The model predicting the melting properties of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>fraction</b> was used to estimate the fractionation conditions which would give an <b>intermediate</b> <b>fraction</b> with melting properties most similar to those of cocoa butter. From this, a fractionation was performed with first and second crystallisation temperatures of 9. 2 °C and 5. 2 °C respectively, solvent to fat ratios at the first and second crystallisations of 1. 0 : 1 and 10. 0 : 1 respectively, a water concentration in the acetone of 0. 6 % and a defined agitation condition. The yields of the hard, intermediate and soft fractions were 34. 5 wt %, 2. 5 wt % and 63. 0 wt % of the tallow respectively. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>fraction</b> contained 51. 0 % of 2 -oleo disaturated triglycerides (compared to 68. 9 % in cocoa butter) and had very similar melting properties to cocoa butter. Then the fractionation scheme was modified to give a greater yield of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>fraction</b> (8. 3 wt %) but the melting properties of this <b>intermediate</b> <b>fraction</b> were less similar to those of cocoa butter. This latter fractionation scheme was scaled up (from 20 g tallow to 200 g and 1 kg). On each scale an <b>intermediate</b> <b>fraction</b> with consistent yield and melting properties was obtained. The yields of the other two fractions varied, however, and overall there was a considerable difference in the behaviour of the fractionations on each scale. Attempts on the 1 kg scale to produce an <b>intermediate</b> <b>fraction</b> with properties similar to those of the best 20 g <b>intermediate</b> <b>fraction</b> (i. e. similar to cocoa butter) were unsuccessful. The highest proportion of the important 2 -oleo disaturated triglycerides attained in a 1 kg scale <b>intermediate</b> <b>fraction</b> was 36. 8 %, and this fraction melted, over a wider temperature range than cocoa butter. This <b>intermediate</b> <b>fraction</b> may be useful as a cocoa butter substitute in a coating chocolate, but is unlikely to be able to replace cocoa butter in chocolate.

Colchicine [25 mumol (10 mg) / 100 gm body wt] was injected intraperitoneally in adult female rats, and hepatic Golgi fractions were prepared at 1, 2, and 3 h postinjection. The enzyme recoveries and morphological appearance of fractions from colchicine-treated and control (alcohol alone) animals were similar. At times greater than 1 h after colchicine there was a marked (greater than 60 %) inhibition of uptake of 125 I-ovine prolactin (125 I-oPRL) into Golgi light and <b>intermediate</b> <b>fractions</b> but no inhibition of uptake into Golgi heavy and plasmalemma elements. At times from 2 to 45 min postinjection, 125 I-oPRL was extracted from Golgi elements and found to be largely intact as judged by rebinding to receptors. The inhibitory effect of colchicine was seen at doses ranging from 0. 25 mumol to 25 mumol/ 100 g body wt. Vincristine also inhibited 125 I-oPRL uptake into the Golgi light and <b>intermediate</b> <b>fractions</b> but lumicolchicine had no inhibitory effect. There was a smaller effect of colchicine both at early (1 h) and later (3 h) times on the extent and pattern of 125 I- insulin uptake. Colchicine treatment did not produce {{a significant change in}} lactogen receptor levels in the Golgi fractions. These results demonstrate that colchicine treatment inhibited the transfer of prolactin into Golgi vesicular elements.

The dead cell layers function as a barrier resistant to degradation, whereas the aleurone layer is involved in mobilizing organic substrates in the endosperm during germination. We microdissected three defined bran fractions, outer layers (epidermis and hypodermis), <b>intermediate</b> <b>fraction</b> (cross cells, tube cells, testa, and nucellar tissue), and inner layer (aleurone cells), and used proteomics to identify their individual protein complements. All proteins of the outer layers were enzymes, whose function is to provide direct protection against pathogens or improve tissue strength. The more complex proteome of the intermediate layers suggests a greater diversity of function, including the inhibition of enzymes secreted by pathogens. The inner layer contains proteins involved in metabolism, {{as would be expected}} from live aleurone cells, but this layer also includes defense enzymes and inhibitors as well as 7 S globulin (specific to this layer). Using immunofluorescence microscopy, oxalate oxidase was localized predominantly to the outer layers, xylanase inhibitor protein I to the xylan-rich nucellar layer of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>fraction</b> and pathogenesis-related protein 4 mainly to the aleurone.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of starches from 17 endosperm mutant genotypes {{in a common}} Oh 43 inbred background were examined by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC), iodine affinity (IA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The chain-length distributions of amylopectins were determined by an enzymatic- chromatographic method. Each genotype exhibited distinctive GPC elution patterns of its native and isoamylase-debranched starches and distinctivemorphology as noted by SEM. The amylose-extender (ae), dull- 1 (du 1), and sugary- 1 (su 1) genes were associated with increased amounts of amylose and <b>intermediate</b> <b>fractions</b> compared with normal starch. The waxy (wx) gene was epistatic to other genes relative to the accumulation of amylopectin, which was consistent with work done elsewhere. The discrepancy in amylose percentage determined by GPC and IA in some genotypes may have resulted from {{the presence of a}} large amount of intermediate materials in those genotypes, which could not always be distinguished from amylose by the IA method. For example, in ae starch, most of the intermediate materials were measured as amylose by the IA procedure, whereas in du 1, ae brittle- 1 (bt 1), and ae du 1 starches, most of the intermediate materials were exclded from IA measurements. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>fractions</b> from each genotype in the GPC elution profiles also differed from each other, suggesting differences in molecular weight and/or branching. The proportions of long B chains and the average chain length of amylopectins were increased when the ae gene was present.

The mutants containing he ae gene showed low degrees of branching in amylopectin; mutants containing the du 1 and/or su 1 genes hd high degrees of branching.

40|$|International audienceSolvent {{gradient}} {{is currently}} used in analytical chromatography and presents an increasing interest in preparative chromatography. The applications relate to complex separations of mixtures where {{the target species}} has an intermediate affinity for the solid support {{compared to that of}} the other species, which is often the case during the purification of biomolecules extracted from natural raw materials or resulting from biotechnologies. In this case, separation leads to three fractions, impurities weakly retained, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>fraction,</b> and impurities strongly retained. An inexpensive and non-toxic mixture, containing five amino-acids, was identified as a good model mixture for such studies. These amino-acids were selected by taking into account their non-polar and hydrophobic nature. They were selected because of their aptitude for being easily detected in UV-visible spectroscopy without derivation. Separations were carried out by reversed phase chromatography. An experimental study first enabled determining the adsorption isotherm parameters of each amino-acid on an analytical column then on a preparative column for various organic solvent fractions. An empirical law was chosen to express the retention factor k {{as a function of the}} mobile phase composition (k=f (x(M))). An approach based on the column modeling by mixed cells in series enabled to simulate the separations obtained on the two types of columns. The use of the laws giving retention factor k as a function of the organic solvent fraction xM then made it possible to carry out simulations for various solvent gradients. A simple methodology was developed to calculate the optimal solvent gradient. The gradient was optimized by minimizing the separation time and by respecting a constraint on the peaks resolution of the two species which are the most difficult to separate. A really good adequacy was observed between the experimental simulations and results for the weakly retained fraction as well as for the <b>intermediate</b> <b>fraction</b> which comprises components difficult to separate. Adequacy is not as good for strongly retained fraction but it is worth using these two species in the model mixture. This model mixture proves to be interesting to study solvent gradient preparative chromatography processes. The retention of these compounds is sensitive to the organic solvent fraction. It is easy to get these products which are inexpensive, non-toxic, and detectable without any derivation...|$|E
40|$|Rats infused {{intravenously}} with taurocholate {{shortly after}} relief of 48 h of biliary obstruction excrete in bile {{twice as much}} phospholipid in relation to cholesterol and bile acid as controls. In an effort to identify a subcellular compartment {{as the source of}} this biliary lipid, we examined several hepatic subcellular organelles for an increase in phospholipid to cholesterol ratio or an increase in biliary-type lecithins (16 : 0 - 18 : 2; 16 : 0 - 20 : 4) either absolute or relative to non-biliary-type lecithins (18 : 0 - 20 : 4; 18 : 0 - 22 : 6) as analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Subcellular fractions studied were: three microsomal subfractions, Golgi heavy and <b>intermediate</b> <b>fractions,</b> and plasma membrane light (canaliculus-enriched) fraction. No organelle fraction from rats with biliary obstruction displayed either a significant increase in phospholipid to cholesterol ratio or a relative or absolute increase in biliary type lecithin. This suggests that biliary lipid changes are not attributable to measurable alterations in lipid composition of any anatomical compartment in the liver cells; changes are probably more related to changes in lipid turnover than to organelle total lipid pool sizes...|$|R
40|$|The {{study has}} been carried out on eleven soils using both soil {{analysis}} and a greenhouse pot experiment. Soil boron has been determined according to the hot water method and fractioned in five distinct fractions. The greenhouse experiment was carried out according to the Neubauer technic using barley as the plant test. Hot water boron represents 0. 81 % of total boron. The > and > fractions are negligible and represent together 1. 18 % of total boron. The residual fraction constitutes the most important fraction and represents 78. 75 %. <b>Intermediate</b> <b>fractions</b> represent together 20. 08 %, of which 8. 04 % is bound to oxydes and 12. 04 % is bound to organic matter. The soil characteristics that most influenced the different forms of soil boron are cation exchange capacity, texture, organic matter and pH. Highly significant correlations have been observed between these soil characteristics and some forms of soil boron. Boron uptake by barley was higher than the quantities of boron corresponding to the > and > fractions. This means that other forms, including organic matter bound-form and probably also oxydes bound-form, participated in boron nutrition of the plants...|$|R
40|$|Light charged hadron {{production}} {{data in the}} current fragmentation region at HERA are calculated using next-to-leading order perturbative calculations and fragmentation functions obtained from similar data from e+ e- reactions. General good agreement is found at large photon virtuality Q^ 2 and <b>intermediate</b> momentum <b>fraction</b> x_p, consistent with fragmentation function universality. The description of the small x_p and Q^ 2 region is improved by incorporating hadron mass effects. Comment: To appear in the proceedings of HERA and the LHC workshop, CERN - DESY 2007 / 200...|$|R
