5|$|Within a short time, Abu Ahmad was conferred an {{extensive}} governorate covering {{most of the}} lands still under caliphal authority: western Arabia, southern <b>Iraq</b> <b>with</b> Baghdad, and Fars. To denote his authority, he assumed an honorific name {{in the style of}} the caliphs, al-Muwaffaq bi-Allah. His power was further expanded in 875, when the Caliph included him in the line of succession after his own son, Ja'far al-Mufawwad, and divided the empire in two large spheres of government. The western provinces were given to al-Mufawwad, while al-Muwaffaq was given charge of the eastern ones; in practice, al-Muwaffaq continued to exercise control over the western provinces as well. With al-Mu'tamid largely confined to Samarra, al-Muwaffaq and his personal secretaries (Sulayman ibn Wahb, Sa'id ibn Makhlad, and Isma'il ibn Bulbul) ruled the Caliphate from Baghdad. What little autonomy al-Mu'tamid enjoyed was further curtailed after the death of the long-serving vizier Ubayd Allah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan in 877, when al-Muwaffaq assumed the right to appoint the Caliph's viziers himself. Al-Muwaffaq's personal secretary Sa'id ibn Makhlad was the outstanding figure in the Caliphate's bureaucracy until his own disgrace in 885, followed after by Isma'il ibn Bulbul, who served concurrently as vizier to both brothers.|$|E
