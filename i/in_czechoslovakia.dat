5|$|During the {{communist}} era, rapid urbanization {{and growth of}} heavy industry occurred. Whole villages in the coal mining areas were destroyed by the mining activity. These conditions quickened the assimilation of the Poles. Another cause of assimilation was {{the high rate of}} intermarriage.

5|$|Berger had {{achieved}} {{the rank of}} Major der Reserve in the Wehrmacht by 1938, but his initial rank upon joining the Allgemeine SS was SS-Standartenführer, based upon his SA service. Berger {{played a key role}} in directing the fifth column Sudetendeutsches Freikorps during the Sudeten Crisis <b>in</b> <b>Czechoslovakia</b> in 1938, and the organisational skills he displayed there marked him as highly suitable for the SS recruiting role.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Czechoslovakia,</b> {{especially}} in the week immediately following the invasion, popular opposition was expressed in numerous spontaneous acts of nonviolent resistance. On 16 January 1969, student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Prague's Wenceslas Square to protest against the renewed suppression of free speech. Civilians purposely gave wrong directions to invading soldiers, while others identified and followed cars belonging to the secret police.|$|E

After World War II, it hasn’t renewed its activity.|$|E
5|$|After World War II many Polish sport clubs resumed slowly their activity. After the {{communist}} takeover of power <b>in</b> <b>Czechoslovakia</b> in February 1948 communists began to curb number of {{organizations in the}} country and tried to achieve the state of only several active nationwide organizations. Therefore, many Polish clubs after 1948 stopped their activity. The ones who still operated were subjected to rising pressure since 1951. Last independent Polish organizations were dissolved in 1952.|$|E

5|$|An {{internal}} {{attempt was}} made to discredit Gomułka's leadership, but there were aspects of the ongoing witch hunt which he found to be to his advantage and he tolerated it until the societal damage wrecked by the Moczar movement had become irreversible. Gomułka's regime reasserted itself and was saved by a combination of international and domestic factors, including the Moczar faction's inability to take over the party and state apparatus. The Soviet Union, now led by Leonid Brezhnev, was preoccupied with the crisis <b>in</b> <b>Czechoslovakia</b> and not inclined to support personal changes in the Polish leadership.|$|E

5|$|However, {{right after}} Dubček assumed power, the scholar Eduard Goldstücker became {{chairman}} of the Union of Czechoslovak Writers and thus editor-in-chief of the previously hard-line communist weekly Literární noviny, which under Novotny had been filled with party loyalists. Goldstucker tested the boundaries of Dubček’s devotion to {{freedom of the press}} when he appeared on a television interview as the new head of the union. On 4 February, in front of the entire nation, he openly criticized Novotny, exposing all of Novotny’s previously unreported policies and explaining how they were preventing progress <b>in</b> <b>Czechoslovakia.</b>|$|E

5|$|Once {{the film}} had been {{released}} <b>in</b> <b>Czechoslovakia,</b> Forman sought an international distributor, who informed him that the film was too short for American audiences and that it didn't have enough nudity in it; so Forman was coerced into shooting some additional scenes that were never shown for domestic consumption. One of these scenes, which {{was included in the}} US version, involved a slapstick sequence in which Milda, the pianist, tries to pick up a buxom girl on the streets of Prague, only to have her trick him into entering the wrong bedroom of the four-story building in which she lives, disturbing the sleeping residents.|$|E

5|$|Sir Nicholas' kindertransport efforts {{remained}} largely unrecognised until 1988, {{when they came}} to public attention after his wife found a scrapbook in their attic documenting the details. Only then did the individuals whom Winton arranged to have transported to safety as children learn the story of how they survived the Holocaust. As the majority of 'Winton's Children' (as they came to be known) were Jewish, it is believed this saved them from certain death had they stayed <b>in</b> <b>Czechoslovakia.</b> As of 2009, the direct descendants of Winton's Children numbered over 5000 people.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} de-Stalinization <b>in</b> <b>Czechoslovakia</b> had begun under Antonín Novotný {{in the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, but had progressed more slowly than in most other states of the Eastern Bloc. Following the lead of Nikita Khrushchev, Novotný proclaimed the {{completion}} of socialism, and the new constitution, accordingly, adopted the name Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The pace of change, however, was sluggish; the rehabilitation of Stalinist-era victims, such as those convicted in the Slánský trials, may have been considered as early as 1963, but {{did not take place}} until 1967.|$|E
5|$|Anti-tobacco {{sentiment}} {{existed in}} Germany {{in the early}} 20th century.

Established in 1904, this organization existed {{for a brief period}} only. The next anti-tobacco organization, the Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents), was established in 1910 in Trautenau, Bohemia. Other anti-smoking organizations were established in 1912 in the cities of Hanover and Dresden. In 1920, a Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in der Tschechoslowakei (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents <b>in</b> <b>Czechoslovakia)</b> was formed in Prague, after Czechoslovakia was separated from Austria at the end of World War I.
