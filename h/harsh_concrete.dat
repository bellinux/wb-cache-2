40|$|Pictured {{across the}} street {{on the corner of}} 1 st and 4 th Avenues (North) in St. Petersburg is the World War Heroes Memorial in Williams Park. Engrave with the word “loyalty” located at the top, this {{memorial}} was erected by the St. Petersburg chapter of American War Mothers to commemorate those who fought in the first World War from 1917 - 1918. The memorial was built on January 1 st 1938 and still stands in the park today. A quote from the memorial reads “God gave us sons: we gave them our country and our country gave them back to God. ” Parks are an important addition to all cities. They are a place for a cities’ historical markers to reside and they offer a brief respite from the urban sprawl around them. Smolski says that urban parks are “the lungs of the city” which provide “breathing space in a <b>harsh</b> <b>concrete</b> 2 ̆ 6 asphalt environment. ”[URL]...|$|E
40|$|Self-healing {{concrete}} holds promising {{benefits to}} reduce the cost for concrete maintenance and repair as cracks are autonomously repaired without any human intervention. In this study, the application of a carbonate precipitating bacterium Bacillus sphaericus was explored. Regarding the <b>harsh</b> condition in <b>concrete,</b> B. sphaericus spores were first encapsulated into a modified-alginate based hydrogel (AM-H) which was proven to have a good compatibility with the bacteria and concrete regarding the influence on bacterial viability and concrete strength. Experimental results show that the spores were still viable after encapsulation. Encapsulated spores can precipitate a large amount of CaCO 3 in/on the hydrogel matrix (around 70 % by weight). Encapsulated B. sphaericus spores were added into mortar specimens and bacterial in situ activity was demonstrated by the oxygen consumption on the mimicked crack surface. While specimens with free spores added showed no oxygen consumption. This indicates the efficient protection of the hydrogel for spores in concrete. To conclude, the AM-H encapsulated carbonate precipitating bacteria have great potential to be used for crack self-healing in concrete applications...|$|R

40|$|Microbial-based {{self-healing}} is {{a promising}} solution for a sustainable concrete. The principle is that carbonate precipitating bacteria and bio-reagents are pre-added into concrete; upon cracking, bacteria will be activated to precipitate CaCO 3 {{to heal the}} crack. Due to the <b>harsh</b> environment in <b>concrete,</b> encapsulation of bacteria is preferable before incorporation into the matrix. In this study, microcapsules and hydrogels were applied to encapsulate bacterial spores. Water is an essential element for bacterial activities. Therefore, water availability is a key factor to obtain considerable amount of healing. In this work, self-healing behavior of the specimens (with and without bacteria incorporated) were investigated at the conditions of 95 %RH and wet-dry cycles (wdc). Two types of wdc were applied: 1) 8 h in water and 16 h in 60 %RH; 2) 1 h in water and 11 h in 60 %RH. Healing efficiency was evaluated by crack closure and the decrease of water permeability. No crack healing was visualized in the specimens stored at 95 %RH. The specimens subjected to wdcs had much more crack healing. Water permeability of the specimens with microencapsulated bacteria was about one order of magnitude {{lower than that of}} the reference ones. About 40 % and 80 % of the crack area was healed in the reference and bacterial specimens (at wdc 1), respectively. For the ones stored at wdc 2, though with a reduced wet period, considerable amount of healing was obtained in the specimens with hydrogel encapsulated bacteria, which had crack healing ratio of 5 %~ 30 % and 50 %~ 100 % for the reference and bacterial series, respectively. This study indicates that incorporation of carbonate precipitating bacteria into concrete can enhance the self-healing efficiency. The amount of available water and the time during which the water can stay available in cracks are of crucial importance to obtain a sufficient healing. This water availability can be enhanced by encapsulating the bacteria in hydrogels...|$|R
40|$|Self-healing {{concrete}} {{has become}} {{the main focus of}} several research programs that have been bringing together people from academia and industry. The remediation of the micro-cracks that are formed in the concrete structures has been the aim of these research programs. These cracks are a quite well known problem that can lead to corrosion of the steel reinforcement and, in the worst cases, to the failure of the entire concrete structure. The maintenance costs due to the repair of these cracks can be of the order of € 130 (direct costs) per m 3 of concrete. Hence, a self-healing technology is of interest to the industrial partners. Scientific studies indicate that a Microbial Induced Carbonate Precipitation (MICP), using microbial spores as active agent, can be an alternative for the actual repair methods. The precipitation of this concrete compatible material allows the filling of the cracks restoring the water tightness of the concrete structure. By avoiding the water ingression one also avoids the corrosion of the reinforcement. However, the production of bacterial spores is yet imposing considerable costs. Industrial concrete producers and contractors are willing to pay extra € 15 to € 20 per m 3 of concrete for a bio-based self-healing product if the increase in service life is ensured. There is an urgent need to develop the production of a bio-additive to make the biological self-healing industrial applicable. Furthermore, protective carriers or encapsulation materials have been used in microbial self-healing concrete studies due to the <b>harsh</b> environment of <b>concrete,</b> i. e. very high pH (~ 13), relatively small pore size (< 0. 1 nm) and dry conditions. These protection methodologies improve the survival probability of the bacterial agents once incorporated in the concrete matrix. This study deals with the up-scaling of suitable bacterial spores for self-healing concrete applications and with the study of some protection methodologies. The first part of this work is directly related with the up-scaling of axenic bacterial spore cultures while a non-axenic bacterial culture is studied in a second part. In the third part of the study different protection methods were tested in order to evaluate concrete compatibility with industrially available materials. The fourth and last part of this study deals with the economic and ecological consequences of this technology and its industrial feasibility. Up-scaling of axenic bacterial spore cultures Both Bacillus sphaericus and Bacillus cohnii spores were first produced at lab scale in order to evaluate and select the best growth conditions. Different media formulations were used to produce the bacterial spores in order to evaluate the most optimal one. MBS (Minimal Basal Salts) and SM 2 (Sporulation Medium 2) media were selected among the tested possibilities as sporulation media for Bacillus sphaericus and Bacillus cohnii respectively. Biological parameters such as microbial activity and calcium carbonate precipitation capabilities were evaluated for both Bacillus sphaericus and Bacillus cohnii vegetative cells resulting from the germination of their respective bacterial spores. Increasing the production volume showed to have no effect on either microbial activity or calcium carbonate precipitation capabilities of both axenic cultures. Despite of the good microbial activity observed, a decrease in the biomass yield from 3. 5 to 2. 5 g CDW/L was registered in the Bacillus sphaericus cultures while no difference was noticed in the Bacillus cohnii cultures. Nevertheless, the biomass yield of the Bacillus sphaericus was still a factor 6 higher than the one of Bacillus cohnii cultures. Moreover, the amount of calcium carbonate precipitated by the Bacillus sphaericus cells was 5 times higher than the one obtained with the Bacillus cohnii cells. Additionally, the sporulation time required for Bacillus sphaericus cultures at 5 L scale, defined as the time required to obtain 90 % of the biomass present in the form of spores, was a factor 4 lower when compared with the one for Bacillus cohnii spores. Both bacterial spores unfortunately provoked a decrease in compressive strength when incorporated in mortar cubes. Nevertheless, both bacterial cultures, produced at lab scale, were able to perform self-healing in mortar specimens when properly immobilized in diatomaceous earth. Both types of bacterial spores produced at lab scale were able to originate vegetative cells capable of closing cracks up to 0. 4 mm. For the bacterial cultures produced at 5 L scale only Bacillus sphaericus was tested regarding self-healing capabilities, revealing the complete closure of cracks up to 0. 4 mm. Yet, the survival capability of Bacillus cohnii spores produced at 5 L scale was tested upon incorporation in mortar specimens. These bacterial spores, when immobilized in diatomaceous earth, were able to survive the mortar incorporation maintaining their viability. Up-scaling of non-axenic bacterial spores culture In this part, the production of a non-axenic ureolytic bacterial culture able to sporulate was evaluated. A powderous material containing an efficient ureolytic microbial community (Cyclic EnRiched Ureolytic Powder or CERUP) was developed. Ureolytic activity, calcium carbonate precipitation capability and the effects in concrete were evaluated at production scales of 5 and 50 L. The non-axenic culture obtained following this new selective process, at both 5 L and 50 L scales, showed {{to be as good as}} the benchmark i. e. axenic vegetative cells resultant from the germination of Bacillus sphaericus spores, both in terms of urea hydrolysis (20 g urea/L in 24 hours) and calcium carbonate precipitation (0. 5 g CaCO 3 /g CDW. h). Plain incorporation of CERUP in concrete was found to be efficient at levels of 0. 5 and 1 % of the cement weight. The use of inexpensive materials to produce CERUP was beneficial for the concrete application since it decreases the total production cost. Protection methods and their compatibility with concrete The use of axenic cultures for self-healing concrete requires some sort of protection of the bacterial agents. On the one hand, biological compatibility is, naturally, an important characteristic that must be attained by the protection material. On the other hand, concrete compatibility and cost feasibility must also be strongly considered. In this part of the study the influence of different protection methodologies was evaluated. Commercially available possible protection approaches (diatomaceous earth, metakaolin, zeolite and air entrainment) were tested regarding their influence on mortar setting and compressive strength when plain incorporated or combined with Bacillus sphaericus spores and their respective nutrients. The influence of CERUP, salt protected/immobilized, was also investigated within the same scope. The most severe effect in setting time was observed in all samples containing nutrients for Bacillus sphaericus with a significantly undesirable increase of 340 minutes. Samples containing Bacillus sphaericus spores showed the most significant undesirable decreases in compressive strength up to 68 %. Yet, the use of the novel salt protected/immobilized CERUP had no significant effect on the setting and the compressive strength of mortar. These results indicate that the use of non-axenic and self-protected bacterial cultures must be considered as a valuable alternative for the currently proposed axenic cultures. Economical and ecological aspects of the microbial based self-healing concrete technology The last part of the present study deals with cost calculation regarding both axenic and non-axenic production of self-healing bacterial agents. Concrete is a very large market and thus, one must consider the need to produce several thousands of tons of biological agent to supply it. Therefore, an economical evaluation upon the different possibilities must be conducted. It was found that the production cost of axenic cultures is, at least, a factor 10 higher than the one of non-axenic cultures. Nevertheless, despite of the lower production cost calculated for the non-axenic cultures, these are still very expensive for concrete application. Hence, process optimization and new techniques must be further studied in order to bring the bacterial self-healing concrete technology closer to full scale application. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions caused by the production of the bacterial agents was also evaluated. It was found that both axenic cultures are responsible for a higher CO 2 emission when compared with the non-axenic ones. However, the production of Bacillus sphaericus spores showed to be responsible for only 2. 7 times more CO 2 emitted when compared with CERUP while the production of Bacillus cohnii spores caused CO 2 emissions 40 times higher than the ones caused by the production of CERUP. Overall, the non-axenic culture (CERUP) showed not only a more feasible production process as also a lower CO 2 footprint. Therefore, the use of non-axenic bacterial cultures for self-healing concrete purposes is more industrially feasible than the use of axenic ones. Biological self-healing concrete requires further optimization in order to reach industrially feasible values. Nonetheless, the technology is of considerable potential and warrants to be further investigated. Future research must be conducted using axenic but particularly also with non-axenic bacterial cultures which can be more robust and hold the potential to be more cost effective...|$|R
