5000|$|The madder {{dyestuff}} {{is combined}} with a <b>dye</b> <b>mordant.</b> According to which mordant used, the resulting color may be anywhere from pink through purple to dark brown. In the 18th century the most valued color was a bright red known as [...] "Turkey Red". The combination of mordants and overall technique used to obtain the Turkey Red originated in the Middle East or Turkey (hence the name). It was a complex and multi-step technique in its Middle Eastern formulation, some parts of which were unnecessary. The process was simplified in late 18th-century Europe. By 1804, a dye maker George Field in Britain had refined a technique to make lake madder by treating it with alum, and an alkali, that converts the water-soluble madder extract into a solid, insoluble pigment. This resulting madder lake has a longer-lasting color, {{and can be used}} more efficaciously, for example by blending it into a paint. Over the following years, it was found that other metal salts, including those containing iron, tin, and chromium, could be used in place of alum to give madder-based pigments of various other colors. This general method of preparing lakes has been known for centuries but was simplified in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.|$|E
30|$|Textile {{materials}} {{treatment with}} mordants prior to dyeing is called as pre-mordanting, which provides exclusive, sufficient time and sites on textile material to bind to the mordants. A proper layering of <b>dye,</b> <b>mordant</b> and textile material formed {{in this type}} of processing of natural colorants on textiles. Metal complexation with textile surface sites from one side and from dye on the other make the color fast to light, washing and rubbing.

Optimum utilization of resources in pre-mordanting makes this more sustainable towards environment and flora and fauna.|$|E

Stoichiometric amounts of the aromatic amines 6 -aminonaphthalene- 2 -sulfonate and 5 -aminosalicylate were generated and excreted into the medium. After re-aeration of the culture, these amines were mineralized by different members of the bacterial culture. Thus, total degradation of a sulfonated azo dye was achieved by using an alternating anaerobic-aerobic treatment. The ability of the mixed bacterial culture to reduce the azo dye was correlated {{with the presence of}} strain BN 6, which possessed the ability to oxidize various naphthalenesulfonic acids.

The dye, mordants, methods, interaction of dye × mordant, dye × method, mordant × method and dye × mordant × method showed {{a significant effect on}} colour strength of the dyed fabrics. Among the selected fabrics, maximum colour strength values (K/S) 0.739 and 0.736 were recorded in pashmina fabric using Salix alba and Populus deltoides in post-mordanting method (Fig.  1 a, b), whereas, the lowest value (0.662) was recorded with Salix alba in simultaneous mordanting, highest colour strength (0.689) was recorded in wool fabric with Salix alba in post-mordanting and lowest value (0.602) was recorded with Populus deltoides in simultaneous mordanting. Cotton fabric does not show much affinity for the <b>dye,</b> <b>mordant</b> and their combinations. Silk fabric exhibited the highest value of 0.695 with Populus deltoides in post-mordanting (Fig.  2 b), while the lowest value (0.555) was recorded with Salix alba in pre- and post-mordanting (Fig.  2 a). The pashmina fabric recorded the maximum K/S value followed by the wool, silk and cotton fabrics. The mordants used in combination with the dyes and in isolation showed a significant change in the colour strength of the fabrics as per the type of the fabrics and method adopted. However, unmordanted samples also showed fair K/S values for each fabric and method. The relative colour strength followed the similar trend and altered as per the efficiency in the K/S of the dyed fabrics in different methods (Fig.  2 a, b; Fig. 3 a, b). The lower values of the colour strength of the cotton fabric can be related to the unsaturated moiety of the natural dyes bearing ionizable hydroxyl and carboxylic groups. Cotton by its nature is negatively charged in water, thus exhibiting poor absorption for natural dyes due to the repulsion effect which causes lower colour strength of the dye on the fabric (Kampeerapappun et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|The first variable-temperature and variable-pressure stopped-flow {{spectrophotometric}} {{study of}} the sequential threading of alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD) onto the guest <b>dye</b> <b>Mordant</b> Orange 10, S, is reported. Complementary (1) H one-dimensional (1 D) variable-temperature kinetic studies and two-dimensional (2 D) rotating-frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) and EXSY NMR studies are also reported. In aqueous solution at 298. 2 K, the first alpha-CD threads onto S to form a 1 : 1 complex S. alpha-CD with a forward rate constant k(1,f) = 15 200 +/- 200 M(- 1) s(- 1) and dethreads with a reverse rate constant k(1,r) = 4. 4 +/- 0. 3 s(- 1). Subsequently, S. alpha-CD isomerizes to S. alpha-CD (k(3,f) = 0. 158 +/- 0. 006 s(- 1), k(3,f) = 0. 148 +/- 0. 006 s(- 1)). This process {{can be viewed as}} a thermodynamically controlled molecular shuttle. A second alpha-CD threads onto S. alpha-CD to form a 1 : 2 complex, S. (alpha-CD) (2), with k(2,f) = 98 +/- 2 M(- 1) s(- 1) and k(2,r) = 0. 032 +/- 0. 002 s(- 1). A second alpha-CD also threads onto S. alpha-CD to form another 1 : 2 complex, S. (alpha-CD) (2), characterized by k(4,f) = 9640 +/- 1800 M(- 1) s(- 1) and k(4,r) = 61 +/- 6 s(- 1). Direct interconvertion between S. (alpha-CD) (2) and S. (alpha-CD) (2) was not detected; instead, they interconvert by dethreading the second alpha-CD and through the isomerization equilibrium between S. alpha-CD and S. alpha-CD. The reaction volumes, DeltaV(0), were found to be negative for the first three equilibria and positive for the fourth equilibrium. For the first three forward and reverse reactions, the volumes of activation are substantially more negative, indicating a compression of the transition state in comparison with the ground states. These data were used in conjunction with DeltaH, DeltaH degrees, DeltaS, and DeltaS degrees data to deduce the dominant mechanistic threading processes, which appear to be largely controlled by changes in hydration and van der Waals interactions, and possibly by conformational changes in both S and alpha-CD. The structure of the four complexes were deduced from (1) H 2 D ROESY NMR studies. Saudan, C.; Dunand, F. A.; Abou-Hamdan, A.; Bugnon, P.; Lye, P. G.; Lincoln, S. F.; Merbach, A. E...|$|E

Textile processing manufacture is the largest sector and initiator of fluid sewage {{in the shape of}} pollutants containing synthetics dyes. Several wastewater treatment technologies are used to treat of these pollutants including conventional and advances treatment such as Physico-chemical, electrochemical, membrane separation, and reverse osmosis. Nevertheless, all these technologies are high cost operating, need of huge space, limited flexibility and generate by-products. The microbial field which is fungal based bioremediation gives promising treatment for decolorize and degrade the synthetic dye in wastewater from textile industry. It was found to be an environmental friendly, low-cost operation and effective compared to conventional and advances treatments. In this present study, the fungal strains from soil and decayed wood isolated from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) Campus and some region in Johor Bahru forest were screened and selected for its ability to decolorize the azo <b>dye,</b> <b>Mordant</b> Orange- 1 (MO- 1). Two isolates RY 36 and RY 42 showed its ability for decolorization of MO- 1 dye, among fifty fungal strains collected. The degradation experiments were conducted in both of the solid and liquid medium amended with 50 ppm of MO- 1 dye. The efficient degraders, RY 36 and RY 42 were identified using 18 S rRNA sequence analysis and morphology characterization. From the results obtained, these fungi belong to the group of Trichoderma harzianum RY 36 and Acremonium spinosum RY 42, respectively. Further, the effect of various environmental factors parameters such as carbon and nitrogen sources, surfactant (Tween 80), aromatic compounds and pH on the dye decolorization by Trichoderma harzianum RY 36 and Acremonium spinosum RY 42 in the liquid medium was assessed. Trichoderma harzianum RY 36 showed efficient decolorization with addition of glucose (84. 16 %), ammonium nitrate (79. 41 %), tween 80 0. 1 mL (27. 68 %), salicylic acid (84. 73 %) pH 3 (89. 42 %) and maximum biomass production of 6840 mg/L was achieved in the presence of yeast extract. Meanwhile, Acremonium spinosum RY 42 showed efficient decolorization of MO- 1 with addition of glucose (86. 6 %), ammonium nitrate (70. 21 %), Tween 80 0. 1 mL (12. 77 %), salicylic acid (84. 68 %) pH 3 (89. 6 %) and maximum biomass production of 7850 mg/L was achieved in the presence of Tween 80 (1. 5 mL). Further, the degradation products of MO- 1 by both of the isolates were identified using Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrophotometer (GC-MS).
