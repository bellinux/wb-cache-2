5|$|Henry Ward Beecher {{was the son}} of Lyman Beecher, a Calvinist {{minister}} who became one of the best-known evangelists of his age. Several of <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters</b> became well-known educators and activists, most notably Harriet Beecher Stowe, who achieved worldwide fame with her abolitionist novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. Henry Ward Beecher graduated from Amherst College in 1834 and Lane Theological Seminary in 1837 before serving as a minister in Indianapolis and Lawrenceburg, Indiana.|$|E

5|$|At {{one point}} at Morley Memorial Junior School he was taught by Roger Waters' mother, Mary. Later, in 1957, he {{attended}} Cambridgeshire High School for Boys (with Waters). His father {{died of cancer}} on 11 December 1961, {{less than a month}} before Barrett's 16th birthday. Also on this day, Barrett had left the entry in his diary blank. By this time, <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters</b> had left home and his mother decided to rent out rooms to lodgers. Eager to help her son recover from his grief, Barrett's mother encouraged the band in which he played, Geoff Mott and The Mottoes, a band which Barrett formed, to perform in their front room. Roger Waters and Syd Barrett were childhood friends, and Waters often visited such gigs. At one point, Waters even organised a gig, a CND benefit at Friends Meeting House on 11 March 1962, but shortly afterwards Geoff Mott joined the Boston Crabs, and the Mottoes broke up.|$|E

25|$|Although O'Nolan was a {{well known}} {{character}} in Dublin during his lifetime, relatively {{little is known}} about his personal life. He joined the Irish civil service in 1935, working in the Department of Local Government. From the time of his father's death in 1937, he supported <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters,</b> eleven in total, on his income.

25|$|He was {{admitted}} to the Protestant European School, like <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters,</b> in January 1902. He continued his studies at this school which was run by the Baptist Mission up to 1909 and then shifted to the Ravenshaw Collegiate School. Here, we was ridiculed by his fellow students because he knew very little Bengali. The day Subhas {{was admitted}} to this school, Beni Madhab Das, the headmaster, understood how brilliant and scintillating his genius was. After securing the second position in the matriculation examination in 1913, he got admitted to the Presidency College where he studied briefly.|$|E
25|$|Ramji Sakpal {{retired in}} 1894 {{and the family}} moved to Satara two years later. Shortly after their move, Ambedkar's mother died. The {{children}} were cared for by their paternal aunt and lived in difficult circumstances. Three sons– Balaram, Anandrao and Bhimrao– and two daughters– Manjula and Tulasa– of the Ambedkars survived them. Of <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters,</b> only Ambedkar passed his examinations and went to high school. His original surname was Sakpal but his father registered his name to school in Ambadawekar, meaning he comes from his native village 'Ambadawe' in Ratnagiri district. His Devrukhe Brahmin teacher, Krishna Keshav Ambedkar, changed his surname from 'Ambadawekar' to his own surname 'Ambedkar' in school records.|$|E
25|$|As a king, Afonso II set a {{different}} approach of government. Hitherto, his father Sancho I and his grandfather Afonso I were mostly concerned with military issues either against the neighbouring Kingdom of Castile or against the Moorish lands in the south. Afonso did not pursue territory enlargement policies and managed to insure peace with Castile during his reign. Despite this, some towns, like Alcácer do Sal in 1217, were conquered from the Moors by the private initiative of noblemen. This {{does not mean that}} he was a weak or somehow cowardly man. The first years of his reign were marked instead by internal disturbances between Afonso and <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters.</b> The king managed to keep security within Portuguese borders only by outlawing and exiling his kin.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1749, Linnaeus could finally journey to Scania, again {{commissioned}} by the Government. With him he brought his student, Olof Söderberg. On the way to Scania, he made his last visit to <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters</b> in Stenbrohult since his father had died the previous year. The expedition {{was similar to the}} previous journeys in most aspects, but this time he was also ordered to find the best place to grow walnut and Swedish whitebeam trees; these trees were used by the military to make rifles. The journey was successful, and Linnaeus' observations were published the next year in [...]|$|E
500|$|Van Meegeren played {{different}} roles, some {{of which}} were shrouded in fraudulent intentions, as he sought to fulfill his goal of besting his critics. Han’s father was said to have once told him, [...] "You are a cheat and always will be." [...] On the other hand, <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters</b> perceived him as loyal, generous, and affectionate, and he was always loving and helpful to his own children. The question [...] "what was his character" [...] cannot be answered unequivocally. Indeed, recent works question many of the existing assumptions about van Meegeren and the motivations for his career in forgery. With Han van Meegeren, everything was double-edged, and his character presents itself as fragments rather than unity. In 2008, Harvard-trained art historian Jonathan Lopez had become fluent in Dutch and published 'The Man Who Made Vermeers, Unvarnishing the Legend of Master Forger Han Van Meegeren'. His extensive research confirmed that van Meegeren started to make forgeries, not so much by feeling misunderstood and undervalued by art critics as for the income that it generated, income which he needed to support his addictions and promiscuity. Lopez confirmed the veracity of Jan Spierdijk's article in 'De Waarheid' in which Spierdijk reported that the book 'Tekeningen 1' by van Meegeren was in Hitler's library, signed by the artist and dedicated to the Führer.|$|E

500|$|Wheatley was {{involved}} in competitive athletics from an early age: In his youth, he ran competitively with the Penn Park track team, where, as an eight-year-old, he stood out for his discipline and promptness. [...] Because of his family trouble, he assumed a family leadership role at a relatively young age. [...] Wheatley {{made it clear to}} <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters</b> that when chaos came to their lives, they should to turn to him because he would be there and he would never fall. When he was in high school, he would take his younger siblings to basketball games, mapping out emergency plans for shooting outbreaks or brawls. Wheatley's guardianship continued throughout his career at the University of Michigan and while he was a professional athlete. While playing in the NFL, he realized that leaving Mongo—the youngest of his siblings—in Inkster and merely providing financial support was not a solution because Mongo was still exposed to gang shootings. As Mongo's guardian, Wheatley moved Mongo to New Jersey for school. Mongo later earned outstanding freshman athlete honors during the Bergen County, New Jersey outdoor track championships while living with Wheatley, who was playing for the Giants at the time. In 2004, with his graduation from high school imminent, Mongo signed a letter of intent with [...] Utah State as a defensive back.|$|E
