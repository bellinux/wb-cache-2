The {{objective of the}} study is to analyze the behavior of <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> production in Burundi under uncertain prices and assess the degree of uncertainty for the period 1972 - 1987. The hypotheses are that <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> prices in Burundi are uncertain, and that annual <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> production per capita has been falling because of <b>dry</b> <b>bean</b> price uncertainty.
