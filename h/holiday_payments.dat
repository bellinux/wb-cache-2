During the summer months, there is a relatively large increase due to <b>holiday</b> <b>payments</b> {{and at the end}} of the year, there are also different annual bonuses being paid to the employees. There are also anecdotal evidence that in some sectors (for instance in construction) hourly wages for some occupations or work tasks remained the same but the piece-wise job requirements were raised. It means that you have to work more in order to get the previous payment.|$|E
40|$|Wage {{supplements}} in {{the form}} of private fringe benefits and statutory contributions to social welfare account for around 25 per cent of the typical firm's total labour costs throughout OECD countries. Yet the relative emphasis on private and statutory payments differs from country to country. For example, the ratio of statutory contributions to private fringes (excluding <b>holiday</b> <b>payments)</b> was 5 0 in the FRG compared to 0. 9 in the USA in 1981. This paper critically assesses the economic arguments for and against both forms of non-wage payment. On the private side, the discussion concentrates on human capital anti union median voter explanations for private fringe payments. Attention is also given to the implications of favourable corporate and individual tax concessions with respect both to the demand for private fringes and to the evaluation of their human capital effects. On the statutory side, social security contributions are discussed in relation to general social welfare, government employment policy and employer-union relations. As part of the general assessment, it is argued that governments should provide a Fiscal framework in this area which is designed to stimulate more effective individual and firm-level choice between equivalent forms of private and statutory supplementary compensation...|$|E

40|$|Some of {{the recent}} changes to {{employment}} legislation in New Zealand are working as intended, this report finds. Overview: This report provides a short-term evaluation of the 2010 amendments to the Employment Relations Act 2000 and Holidays Act 2003. The evaluation follows a mixed methods approach, based on qualitative interviews and quantitative survey data, and includes the following key areas of legislative change; 	allowing all employers the option to use trial periods 	changes to the Holidays Act (cashing up annual holidays, transferring public <b>holidays,</b> <b>payment</b> for some <b>holidays</b> and leave and providing proof of sickness) 	making union access to workplaces conditional on employer consent, and 	changes in provisions relating to employment problem resolution. For trial periods, some {{of the benefits of}} extending coverage to all businesses identified included reduced risk when hiring new people, greater flexibility, ease and security of use and some cost savings for employers. The report shows that extending the use of trial periods to all employers has resulted in more employment opportunities, with one third of employers surveyed saying the provision has led to them hiring people they otherwise wouldn’t have. For the Holidays Act amendments, benefits included greater flexibility and increased choices for some employers and employees. In some cases the evaluation found that the successful uptake of the changes has been affected by variable levels of understanding and difficulty applying the changes. For example, employers are finding that some Holidays Act provisions are still difficult to apply in some work arrangements, such as for people with variable work hours...|$|R

I joined in the tours between September and December 2006 and using a questionnaire personally interviewed 256 of the residents to evaluate the program 2 ̆ 7 s impact on their relations with KWS and the management of LNNP, how it stimulated the need for recreational wildlife viewing among them, and identify the program 2 ̆ 7 s weaknesses and the residents 2 ̆ 7 views for its improvement. Results reveal high potential for sustainable local tourism among residents of Nakuru Municipality. Popular opinion was that the program had improved residents 2 ̆ 7 relations with KWS and with the management of Lake Nakuru National Park, had made them appreciate recreational and aesthetic values of wildlife and generated demand for wildlife viewing as a pastime. Respondents were unanimous that one bus was not enough for the program and a majority felt the game drives were too short although they were set for a repeat visit to the park. Most respondents visited the park with companions comprising friends and family members. The program was rated a success and improvements are proposed for better satisfaction of residents. Where feasible the Lake Nakuru National Park example should be extended to other wildlife protected areas to boost local tourism and improve relations between wildlife managers and local communities in Kenya...|$|R

It was surprised {{that there was a}} tendency, especially in rent-buy clause, the society were facilitated by law guarantee in using rent-buy thing than un-supported economic. In other word, usage principle was the major reason than the economic principle itself. Menkoperindag rule no. 34 /II/ 1980 was a strong tendency that law needs about rent-buy clause was un-rejected. Which means, though in several things the understanding was disturbed by the reality where people as law user has directed into the condition, so that the needs of new rule has become un-avoidance needs. Assurance as collateral institution, in relation with rent-buy clause has related with the fact for so long. Which mean between rent-buy clause and assurance, where rent-buy actually was two separated substances, both could happen {{at the same time in}} condition where the object became burden things. That’s why the relation between them was interesting to be discussed. In this thesis, the writer chose problems related with two things, related with assurance claim for rent-buy things. The research took statement of problems : 1. How the application of rent-buy agreement ? 2. How the application of assurance if there was an evenement ? how the assurance claim when there was rights transfer from third party ? The research used juridical sociology approach, data collection was direct interview and documentation from Federal International Finance and Astra Buana Assurance at Malang as location of primary data. The data then analyzed in descriptive analysis way. The result showed that in motor vehicle rent-buy agreement where the payment process was done in scale along the buyer couldn’t pay the whole price, the thing still in FIF rights until the buyer could pay the last payment. Duty and rights of the buyer for the claim and loss claim when there was evenement, the duty of the buyer was pay the motor vehicle as stated by the agreement clauses. The claim was 3 x 24 work hour, not including <b>holiday,</b> the <b>payment</b> would be considered expired and the payment was 100...|$|R

Prior his departure, he had sought {{professional}} advice on the tax implications relating to his assets which eventually led to him setting up an elaborate scheme to avoid adverse exchange control implications. The scheme involved him, inter alia, vesting the beneficial interests in both the assets and the income in a British Virgin Islands company {{through a series of}} agreements. In consequence to all his transactional activity, according to Mr Krok, he ceded all his South African income and assets to a company except for the bare ownership thereof, and he had no income or capital gains on which he could be taxed by the ATO under the agreements. On 29 December 2008, Mr Krok again emigrated from Australia to the United Kingdom. He set up a similar tax avoidance scheme in respect of which he purported to transfer to the second appellant, Jucool Enterprises Inc. (Jucool), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, his assets situated in South Africa. In 2009, the ATO launched an audit of Mr Krok’s taxation affairs as part of a government initiative investigating participation by Australians in internationally promoted tax arrangements to identify taxpayers involved in significant offshore transactions or large transfers of funds to or from Australia. Resultant, the ATO held Mr Krok liable for $25 361 875.79 plus interest.” The ATO’s investigation also revealed Krok’s illegal use of funds while his assets were frozen, noting that Krok used South African credit cards from blocked assets for purchases ranging from the purchasing and renovation of multiple <b>holiday</b> homes, private <b>payments</b> to his mother and the purchasing of 2010 FIFA World Cup tickets.|$|R

5000|$|... (A) The {{first class}} {{includes}} factory and workshop acts, laws relating to hours of labour, work on Sundays and <b>holidays,</b> the <b>payment</b> of wages, the liability of employers for injuries to their employees, &c. Factory acts {{have been passed}} by Factory [...] nearly all {{the states of the}} Union. These may be and work- [...] considered in two groups - first, laws which relate to conditions of employment and affect only children, young persons and women; and second, laws which relate to the sanitary condition of factories and workshops and to the safety of employees generally. The states adopting such laws have usually made provision for factory inspectors, whose duties are to enforce these laws and who have power to enter and inspect factories and workshops. The most common provisions of the factory acts in the various states are those which fix an age limit below which employment is unlawful. All but five states have enacted such provisions, and these five states have practically no manufacturing industries. In some states the laws fixing an age limit are restricted in their application to factories, while in others they extend also to workshops, bakeries, mercantile establishments and other work places where children are employed. The prescribed age limit varies from ten to fourteen years. Provisions concerning the education of children in factories and workshops may be considered in two groups, those relating to apprenticeship and those requiring a certain educational qualification as a prerequisite to employment. Apprenticeship laws are numerous, but they do not now have great force, because of the practical abrogation of the apprenticeship system through the operation of modern methods of production. Most states have provisions prohibiting illiterates under a specified age, usually sixteen, from being employed in factories and workshops. The provisions of the factory acts relating to hours of labour and night work generally affect only the employment of women and young persons. Most of the states have enacted such provisions, those limiting the hours of children occurring more frequently than those limiting the hours of women. The hour limit for work in such cases ranges from six per day to sixty-six per week. Where the working time of children is restricted, the minimum age prescribed for such children ranges from twelve to twenty-one years. In some cases the restriction of the hours of labour of women and children is general, while in others it applies only to employment in one or more classes of industries. Other provisions of law for the protection of women and children, but not usually confined in their operation to factories and workshops, are such as require seats for females and separate toilet facilities for the sexes, and prohibit employment in certain occupations as in mines, places where intoxicants are manufactured or sold, in cleaning or operating dangerous machinery, &c. Provisions of factory acts relating to the sanitary condition of factories and workshops and the safety of employees have been enacted in nearly all the manufacturing states of the Union. They prohibit overcrowding, and require proper ventilation, sufficient light and heat, the lime-washing or painting of walls and ceilings, the provision of exhaust fans and blowers in places where dust or dangerous fumes are generated, guards on machinery, mechanical belts and gearing shifters, guards on elevators and hoistways, hand-rails on stairs, fire-escapes, &c.|$|R
