40|$|Oligosaccharide {{synthesis}} {{is one of}} {{the challenging}} problems in carbohydrate chemistry. Carbohydrates are found in nature but they are present in heterogeneous form and in very small quantity. Over the past few decades chemical synthesis of carbohydrates has took off because of their biological properties. Since solution phase synthesis is very long and tedious, solid-phase synthesis took carbohydrate chemist to a new level. With the advent of automated solid phase synthesis developed by Seeberger and coworkers, many complex oligosaccharides were readily available for biological studies. The major drawback of solid-phase synthesis is it uses huge amount of sugar donors in each coupling cycle. In this dissertation, we use fluorous support for carbohydrate synthesis. This method requires only 1. 5 equivalent of sugar donor as the reaction takes place in solution phase. The fluorous tail can be used for direct formation of carbohydrate microarrays to study protein-carbohydrate interactions;The first syntheses are reported of galactose, and fucose tagged with a single C 8 F 17 -tail for ease of purification as well as for facile array formation. Benzyl carbonate was used for neighbouring group participation in the synthesis of fluorous-tagged fucose. Screening of these carbohydrate microarrays against two lectins demonstrates that the noncovalent fluorous-fluorous interaction is sufficient to retain monosaccharides;A surface patterning method based on noncovalent immobilization of fluorous-tagged sugars on fluorous-derivatized glass slides allows the facile fabrication of carbohydrate microarrays. To expand the scope of these arrays, the first syntheses are reported of mannose and heptomannose oligosaccharides tagged with a single C 8 F 17 -tail for ease of purification as well as array formation. The fluorous-tag allows synthesis of mannose tetrasaccharide in a manner as to mimic automated synthesizer. High purity of oligosaccharides was obtained by just filtering the reaction mixture on a fluorous solid-phase extraction (FSPE) column. D-glycero-D-manno and L-glycero-D-manno <b>heptoses</b> were synthesized using similar method. The binding of these <b>heptoses</b> with mannose binding lectin Con A is not known.

Glycosylation is mediated by a specific heptosyltransferase encoded by the aah gene, but little is known about the role of this modification and the mechanism involved. In this study, we identified several peptides of AIDA-I modified by the addition of <b>heptoses</b> by use of mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing of proteolytic fragments of AIDA-I. One threonine and 15 serine residues were identified as bearing <b>heptoses,</b> thus demonstrating for the first time that AIDA-I is O-glycosylated. We observed that unglycosylated AIDA-I is expressed in smaller amounts than its glycosylated counterpart and shows extensive signs of degradation upon heat extraction. We also observed that unglycosylated AIDA-I is more sensitive to proteases and induces important extracytoplasmic stress. Lastly, as was previously shown, we noted that glycosylation is required for AIDA-I to mediate adhesion to cultured epithelial cells, but purified mature AIDA-I fused to GST was found to bind in vitro to cells whether or not it was glycosylated. Taken together, our results suggest that glycosylation is required to ensure a normal conformation of AIDA-I and may be only indirectly necessary for its cell-binding function...|$|R

Using ultrafiltration, silver cation preparative chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we identified 50 novel sugar compounds after hydrolysis of the high molecular weight dissolved organic matter fraction (HMWDOM; the fraction of DOM isolated after ultrafiltration). Sugars were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those of chemically synthetized standards and with spectra previously described in the literature.

Measurement of the synthesis of beta-galactosidase from a cps-lacZ fusion showed that the mucoid phenotype was due to rcsC-dependent induction of colanic acid capsular polysaccharide synthesis. Complementation of delta rfa 1 with rfaG+ DNA fragments resulted in a larger core and restored the synthesis of flagella and pili but did not reverse the deep rough phenotype or the induction of cps-lacZ, while complementation with a fragment carrying only rfaP+ reversed the deep rough phenotype but not the loss of flagella and pili. A longer deletion which removed rfaQGPBIJ was also constructed, and complementation studies with this deletion showed that the product of rfaQ was not required for the functions of rfaG and rfaP.

Reciprocal syntheses between different hexoses by isomerization and then between pentoses, hexoses, and <b>heptoses</b> by reaction of degradation and synthesis proved the value of the systematics he had established. His greatest success was his synthesis of glucose, fructose and mannose in 1890, starting from glycerol.|$|R
40|$|The {{endotoxin}} of a heptoseless mutant of Salmonella minnesota R 595 was extracted with phenol-water. Most of {{this material}} was found distributed in the insoluble fraction of the extract. The {{results showed that the}} R 595 endotoxin behaved as a lipid rather than as a lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The preparation, although it does not contain O-specific polysaccharides, does contain 2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctonic acid (KDO), hexosamine, and several other unidentified compounds. Therefore, the term “glycolipid” is used in this paper instead of lipopolysaccharide. The crude glycolipid fraction, which was soluble in a mixture of chloroform-methanol (8 : 2), was purified by a procedure including fractionation with organic solvents and by different-column chromatographic methods. Although a chromatographic fraction of the glycolipid showed homogeneity in most systems investigated, the presence of contaminants could not be excluded. Chemical analysis of the glycolipids showed the absence of hexoses and <b>heptoses.</b> Constituents which were found were hexosamine, KDO, fatty acids, and phosphorus, which showed a relatively simple chemical composition. Partial acidic hydrolysis of the glycolipid yielded hexosamine-phosphates, as described in “Lipid A” fractions of smooth LPS preparations. Thin-layer chromatography of the partially hydrolyzed glycolipid showed a pattern similar to “Lipid A” fractions of other strains. The biological activity of the glycolipid was at the same level as that of other gram-negative endotoxins. Pyrogenicity, Shwartzman reactivity, and chick embryo ld 50 values were as high or higher than those of purified Serratia marcescens endotoxin preparations, but mouse ld 50 measurements gave significantly lower results...|$|R
40|$|Mice immunized with {{purified}} whole-cell {{ribonucleic acid}} (RNA), RNA from the bacterial “particulate” fraction, and ribosome-associated RNA obtained from Salmonella typhimurium {{were found to}} be resistant to subsequent challenge infection with virulent salmonellae. Chemically, the immunogenic nucleic acid fractions contained from 1 to 3 % “contaminant” material defined (based on the mean of 19 different preparations) as protein (0. 24 %), deoxyribonucleic acid (0. 43 %), methyl pentose (0. 64 %), hexose (1. 58 %), and undefined carbohydrate (0. 76 %). <b>Heptoses</b> and lipoidal material were not detectable in any of the immunogenic preparations examined. Physically, the nucleic acid preparations, after analytical ultracentrifugation, exhibited three boundaries similar to those reported elsewhere in comparable systems: 4 to 5 S, 16 S, and 23 S. An evaluation of the immunity induced by the ribosome-associated RNA established that the immune response was (i) comparable to that induced 15 days postimmunization with live salmonellae and by ribosomal vaccines, but greater at 30 days postimmunization than that in mice immunized with attenuated salmonellae; (ii) dependent on the quantity of immunogen administered; (iii) dependent {{on the size of the}} infective inocula; (iv) inhibited at 15 but not at 30 days postimmunization when the immunogenic nucleic acid preparations were incorporated into Freund's incomplete adjuvant, (v) reduced or lost by dialysis in relatively high or low immunizing doses, respectively; and (vi) unaffected by enzymatic treatment of the preparations with trypsin, deoxyribonuclease, Pronase plus pancreatic ribonuclease, or pancreatic ribonuclease alone. The possible mode of action of ribosome-associated RNA in inducing an immune response to subsequent challenge infection with the homologous organism is discussed...|$|R
