According to her, he sensed his impending death and felt pressure to complete his unfinished research tasks. Canavan quoted him as saying, [...] "I shall not live long, I must hurry; <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> lots of others busy." ...|$|E
500|$|From April 1888, Frederick {{became so}} weak {{he was unable}} to walk, and was largely {{confined}} to his bed; his continual coughing brought up large quantities of pus. In early June, the cancer spread to and perforated his esophagus, preventing him from eating. He suffered from bouts of vomiting and ran high fevers, but remained alert enough to write a last diary entry on 11 June: [...] "What's happening to me? <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> well again; I have so much to do!" [...] Frederick III died in Potsdam at 11:30 a.m. on 15 June 1888, and was succeeded by his 29-year-old son Wilhelm II. Frederick is buried in a mausoleum attached to the Friedenskirche in Potsdam. After his death, William Ewart Gladstone described him as the [...] "Barbarossa of German liberalism". Empress Victoria went on to continue spreading Frederick's thoughts and ideals throughout Germany, but no longer had power within the government.|$|E
500|$|In late 1969, after George Harrison's song [...] "Something" [...] {{had been}} issued on the A-side {{of a single}} by the Beatles – {{the first time that}} one of his {{compositions}} had been given that honour – he remarked in an interview: [...] "There's a lot of songs like that in my head. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> them down. Maybe even other people would like to sing them." [...] In the summer of 1970, [...] "Something" [...] gave Welsh singer Shirley Bassey her biggest UK hit in nine years, an achievement that led her to tell the press that she and Harrison could become a singer-and-songwriter pairing on the scale of Dionne Warwick and Burt Bacharach. Although he would later be dismissive of Bassey's version of [...] "Something", Harrison wrote a new song for her to record after reading these comments. Originally titled [...] "Whenever", it became [...] "When Every Song Is Sung" [...] and later [...] "I'll Still Love You".|$|E

[...] "The {{young man is}} all that you say, even more ingenuous than I had {{believed}} possible, but <b>I</b> fancy <b>I</b> <b>must</b> be <b>getting</b> old.

500|$|John Diefenbaker {{had been}} {{interested}} in politics from an early age, and told his mother {{at the age of}} eight or nine that he would some day be Prime Minister. She told him that it was an impossible ambition, especially for a boy living on the prairies. She would live to be proved wrong. John's first contact with politics came in 1910, when he sold a newspaper to Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in Saskatoon to lay the cornerstone for the University's first building. The present and future Prime Ministers conversed, and when giving his speech that afternoon, Sir Wilfrid commented on the newsboy who had ended their conversation by saying, [...] "I can't waste any more time on you, Prime Minister. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> about my work." [...] The authenticity of the meeting was questioned in the 21st century, with an author suggesting that it was invented by Diefenbaker during an election campaign.|$|E
2500|$|On 29 July 1910, {{while in}} Saskatoon {{to attend the}} opening of the University of Saskatchewan, he bought a {{newspaper}} from a young John Diefenbaker, a future Conservative Prime Minister. The young Diefenbaker, recognizing the Prime Minister, shared his ideas for the country and amused him. He inquired about the young man's business and expressed the hope that he would be a great man someday. [...] The boy ended the conversation by saying, [...] "Well, Mr. Prime Minister, I can't waste any more time on you. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> back to work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] Dave gave a groan {{that came}} {{straight}} from his heart. [...] "Oh, boys, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> that back! I can't {{afford to lose}} it! <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>get</b> it back! It is worth {{more to me than}} anything in the world!" [...] He was so agitated that he could scarcely control himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yeth!" [...] {{insisted the}} cherub, waving imperiously to an {{approaching}} street-car. [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> be <b>getting</b> up-town. I've got a date. Thee you later." ...|$|R
