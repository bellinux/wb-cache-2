40|$|This paper {{examines}} the current academic and policy literatures concerning school evaluation in {{primary and secondary}} education within the OECD countries. First, it provides a typology of the existing systems of school evaluation across the OECD. It encompasses the diverse criteria and instruments commonly used to carry out schools evaluation, {{as well as the}} players involved in the design and implementation of school evaluation. It also describes potential consequences for schools. Second, this paper analyses how school <b>evaluation</b> <b>schemes</b> are interrelated with other components of the evaluation framework, such as teacher evaluation and system evaluation. The potential complementarities, duplication and inconsistency of objectives stemming from these interrelations are discussed. Third, this paper presents the advantages and drawbacks of different approaches to school evaluation, the resistance and implementation difficulties resulting from misalignment of interests between different stakeholders, and possible ways to overcome impediments to implementation. Finally, it reviews the quantitative and qualitative evidence available on the impact of different school <b>evaluation</b> <b>schemes</b> on school performance, student learning and the incentives for the teaching staff. It concludes by considering the circumstances under which school <b>evaluation</b> <b>schemes</b> seem to be more conducive to school improvement. The effectiveness of school <b>evaluation</b> <b>schemes</b> relies on developing competencies for evaluation and for using feedbacks. Alignment of stakeholders' interests is also critical to have the support of those being assessed...|$|R

The experiments conducted in this study aim at assessing whether the proposed evaluation protocol and methodology provide a fair estimate of the adequacy of cross-lingual predictions in translations. For this purpose, the gold SemEval paraphrases are fed into a state-of-the-art MT system and the obtained translations are compared to paraphrase quality judgments based on the source context. The results show the strong dependence of cross-lingual paraphrase adequacy on the translation context and {{cast doubt on the}} contribution that systems performing well in existing <b>evaluation</b> <b>schemes</b> would have on MT.

Considering the characteristics of relevant <b>evaluation</b> <b>schemes,</b> the requirements for useful performance evaluation and the criteria for selecting key performance indicators (KPIs), an integrated process-hierarchy model was formed for identifying applicable indicators for the intended scheme.

Literature databases of Medline, Web of Science, and Embase. Study Selection and Data Extraction. Two authors separately evaluated potentially eligible papers and independently extracted data. RESULTS: We identified 19 schemes, published between 1978 and 2007. Despite their variability, these models show substantial similarity. Common phases are evaluations of technical efficacy, diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic thinking efficacy, therapeutic efficacy, patient outcome, and societal aspects. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation frameworks can be useful to distinguish between study types, but they cannot {{be seen as a}} necessary sequence of evaluations. The evaluation of tests is most likely not a linear but a cyclic and repetitive proces...|$|R

From the observations in TDT, news topics can be described in different sizes, making it hard to define the “correct ” granularity.

This paper shows the task definition, <b>evaluation</b> <b>schemes,</b> our attempt to generate a proper hierarchy, comparisons of different participants, and detailed analysis of the results. In the hierarchical structure, not all units satisfy the definition of topics.
