40|$|In {{the present}} work, a fault {{diagnosis}} strategy is developed for multiphase batch processes based on comprehensive subspace decomposition and reconstruction modeling method. Phase nature of fault processes is analyzed and a principal component of fault deviations (PCFD) modeling {{algorithm is proposed}} in each phase to characterize the fault effects responsible to out-of-control monitoring statistics in two different monitoring subspaces, principal component subspace (PCS), and residual subspace (RS), respectively. Phase-based reconstruction models are then developed in each monitoring subspace based on those significant fault deviations, which can better explain fault characteristics. The action of fault diagnosis is then taken by finding the specific reconstruction model that can well eliminate alarming signals. Critical-to-diagnosis phases are identified to provide more-reliable fault isolation results. The proposed in-line fault diagnosis method can give an enhanced understanding of different fault characteristics across different phases and {{it is easier to}} identify the <b>fault</b> <b>root</b> cause in each local phase.

In distribution systems, automated fault diagnosis algorithms learn the relationship between <b>fault</b> <b>root</b> causes and environmental factors from historical fault events and infer {{the root cause of}} those under study. As distribution systems are spatially dispersed and heterogeneous, sampling historical fault events from a small geographic area is preferred in order to focus on the local fault characteristics. However, a small sampling area may not provide enough data for the algorithms to make proper inference. In this work, the sampling issue in distribution fault diagnosis is studied and the Small World Stratification sampling strategy is proposed. Outage records from the distribution systems of Progress Energy Carolinas Inc. are first integrated with environmental data from other resources and then analyzed to reveal the effect of sampling.

40|$|Given their {{potentially}} enormous risk, {{process monitoring}} and fault diagnosis for chemical plants {{have recently been}} the focus of many studies. Based on hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), wavelet neural network (WNN), and fault tree analysis (FTA), a hybrid process monitoring and fault diagnosis approach is proposed in this study. HAZOP analysis helps identify the fault modes and determine process variables monitored. The KPCA model is then constructed to reduce monitoring variable dimensionality. Meanwhile, the fault features of the monitoring variables are extracted, so then process monitoring can be performed with the squared prediction error (SPE) statistics of KPCA. Then, multiple WNN models are designed through the use of low-dimensional sample data preprocessed by KPCA as the training and test samples to detect the fault mode online. Finally, FTA approach is introduced to further locate the <b>fault</b> <b>root</b> causes of the fault mode. The proposed approach is applied to process monitoring and fault diagnosis in a depropanizer unit. Case study results indicate that this approach can be applicable to process monitoring and diagnosis in large-scale chemical plants.

40|$|Server {{virtualization}} is {{now becoming}} {{an effective means}} to consolidate numerous applications into {{a small number of}} machines. While such a strategy can lead to significant savings in power and hardware cost, it may complicate the fault management task due to the increasing scalability and complexity in the virtualized environment. In this paper, we propose PeerWatch, a fault detection and diagnosis tool specially designed for virtualized consolidation systems. Based on the observation that each application usually reveals itself in multiple instances in the virtualized data center, PeerWatch introduces a statistical technique, canonical correlation analysis (CCA), to extract the correlated characteristics between multiple application instances. The extracted correlations are utilized to examine the status of each application instance. If some correlations drop significantly during the operation, PeerWatch regards that the system is in faulty situation and produces alarms. PeerWatch is robust to system dynamics, compared to traditional fault detection techniques and thus can avoid a lot of false alarms. Once the fault has been detected, PeerWatch proposes a diagnosis process that also takes advantage of the multiple instances feature in the virtualized systems. The diagnosis combines the spatial and temporal analysis on the measurement data across multiple instances before and after the failure. As a result, PeerWatch can obtain much accurate clues about the <b>fault</b> <b>root</b> cause. Experimental results in our virtualized testbed system have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed detection and diagnosis tool. ...|$|E

40|$|Multivariate {{statistical}} {{techniques are}} one of the most widely used approaches in data driven monitoring and fault detection schemes in industrial processes. Concretely, principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied to many complex systems with good results. Nevertheless, the PCA-based fault detection and isolation approaches present some problems in the monitoring of processes with different operating modes and in the identification of the <b>fault</b> <b>root</b> in the fault isolation phase. PCA uses historical databases to build empirical models. The models obtained are able to describe the system¿s trend. PCA models extract useful information from the historical data. This extraction is based on the calculation of the relationship between the measured variables. When a fault appears, it can change the covariance structure captured, and this situation can be detected using different control charts. Another widely used multivariate statistical technique is partial least squares regression (PLS). PLS has also been applied as a data driven fault detection and isolation method. Moreover, this type of methods has been used as estimation techniques in soft sensor design. PLS is a regression method based on principal components. The main goal of this Thesis deals with the monitoring, fault detection and isolation and estimation methods in processes based on multivariate statistical techniques such as principal component analysis and partial least squares. The main contributions of this work can be arranged in the three following topics: ¿ The first topic is related with the monitoring of continuous processes. When a process operates in several operating modes, the classical PCA approach is not the most suitable method. In this work, an approach for monitoring the whole behaviour of a process, taking into account the different operating modes and transient states, is presented. The monitoring of transient states and start-ups is studied in detail. Also, the continuous processes which do not operate in a strict steady state are monitored in a similar way to the transient states. ¿ The second topic is related with the combination of model-based structural model decomposition techniques and principal component analysis. Concretely, the possible conflicts (PCs) approach is applied. PCs compute subsystems within a system model as minimal subsets of equations with an analytical redundancy property to detect and isolate faults. The residuals obtained with this method can be useful to perform a complete fault isolation procedure. These residuals are monitored using a PCA model in order to simplify and improve the fault detection task. ¿ The third topic addresses the estimation task in soft sensor design. In this case, the soft sensors of a real process are studied and improved using neural networks and multivariate statistical techniques. In this case, a dry substance (DS) content sensor based on indirect measurements is replaced by a neural network-based sensor. This type of sensors take into account more variables of the process and obtain more robust and accurate estimations. Moreover, this sensor can be improved using a PCA layer at the network input in order to reduce the number of inputs in the network. Also, a PLS-based sensor is designed in this topic. It also improves the sensor based on indirect measurements. Finally, the different approaches developed in this work have been applied to several process plants.

40|$|This {{research}} mainly {{deals with}} fault diagnosis in {{nuclear power plants}} (NPP), based on a framework that integrates contributions from fault scope identification, optimal sensor placement, sensor validation, equipment condition monitoring, and diagnostic reasoning based on pattern analysis. The research has a particular focus on applications where data collected from the existing SCADA (supervisory, control, and data acquisition) system is not sufficient for the fault diagnosis system. Specifically, the following methods and systems are developed. A sensor placement model is developed to guide optimal placement of sensors in NPPs. The model includes 1) a method to extract a quantitative fault-sensor incidence matrix for a system; 2) a fault diagnosability criterion based {{on the degree of}} singularities of the incidence matrix; and 3) procedures to place additional sensors to meet the diagnosability criterion. Usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a nuclear power plant process control test facility (NPCTF). Experimental results show that three pairs of undiagnosable faults can be effectively distinguished with three additional sensors selected by the proposed model. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is designed and a prototype is implemented on the NPCTF. WSN is an effective tool to collect data for fault diagnosis, especially for systems where additional measurements are needed. The WSN has distributed data processing and information fusion for fault diagnosis. Experimental results on the NPCTF show that the WSN system can be used to diagnose all six fault scenarios considered for the system. A fault diagnosis method based on semi-supervised pattern classification is developed which requires significantly fewer training data than is typically required in existing fault diagnosis models. It is a promising tool for applications in NPPs, where it is usually difficult to obtain training data under fault conditions for a conventional fault diagnosis model. The proposed method has successfully diagnosed nine types of faults physically simulated on the NPCTF. For equipment condition monitoring, a modified S-transform (MST) algorithm is developed by using shaping functions, particularly sigmoid functions, to modify the window width of the existing standard S-transform. The MST can achieve superior time-frequency resolution for applications that involves non-stationary multi-modal signals, where classical methods may fail. Effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using a vibration test system as well as applications to detect a collapsed pipe support in the NPCTF. The experimental results show that by observing changes in time-frequency characteristics of vibration signals, one can effectively detect faults occurred in components of an industrial system. To ensure that a fault diagnosis system does not suffer from erroneous data, a fault detection and isolation (FDI) method based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is extended for sensor validations, where sensor faults are detected and isolated from the reconstruction errors of a KPCA model. The method is validated using measurement data from a physical NPP. The NPCTF is designed and constructed in this research for experimental validations of fault diagnosis methods and systems. Faults can be physically simulated on the NPCTF. In addition, the NPCTF is designed to support systems based on different instrumentation and control technologies such as WSN and distributed control systems. The NPCTF has been successfully utilized to validate the algorithms and WSN system developed in this research. In a real world application, it is seldom the case that one single fault diagnostic scheme can meet all the requirements of a fault diagnostic system in a nuclear power. In fact, the values and performance of the diagnosis system can potentially be enhanced if some of the methods developed in this thesis can be integrated into a suite of diagnostic tools. In such an integrated system, WSN nodes can be used to collect additional data deemed necessary by sensor placement models. These data can be integrated with those from existing SCADA systems for more comprehensive fault diagnosis. An online performance monitoring system monitors the conditions of the equipment and provides key information for the tasks of condition-based maintenance. When a fault is detected, the measured data are subsequently acquired and analyzed by pattern classification models to identify the nature of the fault. By analyzing the symptoms of the <b>fault,</b> <b>root</b> causes of the fault can eventually be identified...|$|E
40|$|Today's largest {{systems have}} over 100, 000 cores, with million-core systems {{expected}} {{over the next}} few years. The large component count means that these systems fail frequently and often in very complex ways, making them difficult to use and maintain.

This paper presents AutomaDeD, a statistical tool that models the timing behavior of each application task and tracks its behavior to identify any abnormalities.

40|$|International audienceAfter {{mountain}} building, {{the crust}} exhibits complex structure. Especially, thickening achieved by nappe-stacking induces rheological heterogenities at all scales: from the fault scale {{up to the}} crustal scale. This process is likely to influence post-orogenic evolution. However, it is generally not considered in numerical models. In this study, we consider the impact of pre-existing thrusts and nappes structures on the mode of post-orogenic extension. We focus on thermomechanical modeling of reactivation of convergent structures inherited from compression. The Aegean domain that experienced extension after {{the formation of the}} Hellenides is considered as a natural laboratory. Natural data are used to constrain a priori the geometry and rheology of the models and to validate them a posteriori. Three problems at different scales are considered. Firstly, we model the reactivation of a thrust as a low angle normal fault. Recent studies show that Aegean detachments were active in the brittle field with very shallow dips. These observations are in contradiction with the classical fault mechanics theory. In order to reconcile both point of view, we propose a new model by introducing an elasto-plastic frictional fault gouge that is able to compact. Our models show that plastic strain on badly oriented faults is favored by compaction of the fault gouge. Secondly, we model the formation of the Corinth rift. The Phyllite-Quartizte nappe is introduced in the upper crust as a weak shallow-dipping layer between the Pindos and Tripolitza massive carbonate nappes. The competence contrast between this nappe and its surrounding controls the dynamics of rifting. High competence contrast leads to the formation of crustal-scale planar <b>faults</b> <b>rooting</b> on the brittle ductile transition of the crust and thin-skinned listric <b>faults</b> <b>rooting</b> on the nappe itself. This model is consistent with the observed microseismicity patterns, the asymmetry of the Corinth Gulf, and the kinematics of fault migration within the basin. Thirdly, we model the formation of the Cycladic metamorphic core complexes. The initial setup takes into account the wedge structure of the Hellenic nappe-pile before extension and the rheology of the different nappes. A metamorphic core complex form with detachements rooting in the former thrust with the same dip. Our model recover the main characteristics of the Cycladic metamorphic core complexes: geometry, finite deformation field, mean exhumation velocities. Moreover it allows to reproduce the complex distribution of P-T paths in the metamorphic units. As a result, structures inherited from compression {{have a major impact on}} the evolution of post-orogenic extension. Particularly, the former thrusts can act as decollement layers at all levels in the crust. This process is likely to take part in the weakness of orogens when boundary conditions become divergent...|$|R

This study also quantifies liquid/gas hydrocarbon generation, migration and seepage dynamics through the post-rift history of the basin. The interpretation of seismic data reveals two mega-sequences: Cretaceous and Cenozoic that are subdivided by major stratigraphic unconformities into 5 and 2 sub-units, respectively. The basin is also divided into 2 structural domains: 1. an extensional domain characterized by basinward dipping listric normal <b>faults</b> <b>rooted</b> at the Cenomanian/Turonian level identified between 500 to 1500 m of present-day depth, 2. a compressional domain that accommodates the up-dip extension on the lower slope, and which is characterized by landward dipping thrust faults.

40|$|The Larderello {{geothermal}} field {{is located in}} the Inner Northern Apennines, in an area which has been subject to extension since the Early Miocene. The latest extensional episode (Pliocene–Present) has resulted in the formation of NW-trending, NE-dipping listric normal faults, whose geometry is controlled down to f 3 km by borehole data. In this paper, we integrate a new interpretation of seismic reflection lines with existing seismic, field, and borehole data to analyse the relations among listric normal faults, the top of the brittle–ductile transition, and the migration of geothermal fluids. In accordance with previous interpretations, we consider the strong reflector (K-horizon) marking the top of the reflective mid-lower crust, and located at a depth of 3 – 5 km in the geothermal area, to represent the top of the brittle–ductile transition. Its reflectivity most probably derives from the presence of overpressured fluids. We identify three main NW-trending, NE-dipping extensional brittle shear zones, showing listric geometry and soling out {{in the vicinity of the}} K-horizon. The latter appears to be dislocated in correspondence of the soling out of the shear zones. These shear zones, because of the associated intense fracturing, represent the most natural channels of upward migration of geothermal fluids from the magmatic sources located below the K-horizon. We suggest that these two conclusions—that listric normal <b>faults</b> <b>root</b> at or near the brittle–ductile transition, and that they act as preferential upward migration paths for magmatic fluids—may be of general validity for {{geothermal field}}s located in extensional settings...|$|R

40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} approach {{is used to}} investigate {{the structure of the}} southern Cretan margin, which is located {{in one of the most}} seismically active forearc regions in Europe. Bathymetric, seismic-reflection, and fault plane solution data were used to identify the main tectonic features on the margin, correlating their evolution with the main sedimentary sequences recognized on Crete. In contrast to the majority of forearc settings in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, southern Crete is a region of predominantly oblique movement above well-defined detachment zones. North-dipping thrust faults identified on seismic-reflection profiles reveal significant crustal shortening during the Miocene due to the westward propagation of the Hellenic fold-and-thrust system. In addition, east-dipping thrust <b>faults</b> <b>rooted</b> on top of pre-Neogene strata were also identified, but only a few of these thrusts affect Neogene to Holocene strata. Small-scale domes derived from evaporitic (Messinian) intrusions deform Pliocene–Quaternary strata. West- and east-dipping normal faults were also recognized within the Mesozoic and Cenozoic successions, and these are related to regional extension during forearc convergence. In such a setting, the fault-bounded continental slope of Crete effectively separates a region of uplift (Crete) from subsiding troughs to the south. Our work shows that structural segmentation at depth is complex, with multiple crustal levels recording contrasting styles of deformation and distinct moment-tensor solutions. This complexity derives from the oblique style of convergence recorded south of Crete, which reactivates distinct crustal levels depending on their rheology and relative degree of metamorphism inherited during Alpine compression. As a result, a strong correlation between seafloor morphology and transtensional movements is recorded in the upper 10 – 15 km of the crust, while transpression prevailed after the Serravallian below these depths...|$|R

All of these mcc’s were formed within the basement of a Late Paleozoic Andean-style arc and across older Mesozoic fold-and-thrust belts of variable age and tectonic vergence. The master Hohhot detachment <b>fault</b> <b>roots</b> southwards within the southern margin of the Daqing Shan for an along-strike distance of at least 120  km. Its geometry in the range to the north is complicated by interference patterns between (1) primary, large-scale NW-SE-trending convex and concave fault corrugations and (2) secondary ENE-WSW-trending antiforms and synforms that folded the detachment in its late kinematic history. As in the Whipple Mtns. of California, the Hohhot master detachment is not of the Wernicke (1981) simple rooted type; instead, it was spawned from a mid-crustal shear zone, the top of which is preserved as a mylonitic front within Carboniferous metasedimentary rocks in its exhumed lower plate. 40 Ar– 39 Ar dating of siliceous volcanic rocks in basal sections of now isolated supradetachment basins suggest that crustal extension began at ca. 127  Ma, although lower-plate mylonitic rocks were not exposed to erosion until after ca. 119  Ma. Essentially synchronous cooling of hornblende, biotite, and muscovite in footwall mylonitic gneisses indicates very rapid exhumation and at ca. 122 – 120  Ma. Contrary to several recent reports, the master detachment clearly cuts across and dismembers older, north-directed thrust sheets of the Daqing Shan foreland fold-and-thrust belt. Folded and thrust-faulted basalts within its foredeep strata are as young as 132. 6  ±  2. 4  Ma, thus defining within 5 – 6  Ma the regional tectonic transition between crustal contraction and profound crustal extension...|$|R

Rock uplift of up to 1. 5 cm/yr is derived from river incision, accounting for sedimentation in the Gangetic plain and channel geometry changes. Rock uplift profiles are found to correlate with bedding dip angles, as expected in fault bend folding. It implies that thrusting along the MFT has absorbed 21 ± 1. 5 mm/yr of N-S shortening on average over the Holocene period. The ± 1. 5 mm/yr defines the 68 % confidence interval and accounts for uncertainties in age, elevation measurements, initial geometry of the deformed terraces, and seismic cycle. At the longitude of Kathmandu, localized thrusting along the Main Frontal Thrust fault must absorb most of the shortening across the Himalaya. By contrast, microseismicity and geodetic monitoring over the last decade suggest that interseismic strain is accumulating beneath the High Himalaya, 50 – 100 km north of the active fold zone, where the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) <b>fault</b> <b>roots</b> into a ductile décollement beneath southern Tibet. In the interseismic period the MHT is locked, and elastic deformation accumulates until being released by large (M_w > 8) earthquakes. These earthquakes break the MHT up to the near surface {{at the front of the}} Himalayan foothills and result in incremental activation of the MFT...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{computer}} systems to be reliable has increasingly become {{important as the}} dependence on their accurate functioning by users increases. The failure of these systems could very costly {{in terms of time}} and money. In as much as system's designers try to design fault-free systems, it is practically impossible to have such systems as different factors could affect them. In order to achieve system's reliability, fault tolerance methods are usually deployed; these methods help the system to produce acceptable results even in the presence of <b>faults.</b> <b>Root</b> cause analysis, a dependability method for which the causes of failures are diagnosed for the purpose of correction or prevention of future occurrence is less efficient. It is reactive and would not prevent the first failure from occurring. For this reason, methods with predictive capabilities are preferred; failure prediction methods are employed to predict the potential failures to enable preventive measures to be applied. Most of the predictive methods have been supervised, requiring accurate knowledge of the system's failures, errors and faults. However, with changing system components and system updates, supervised methods are ineffective. Error detection methods allows error patterns to be detected early to enable preventive methods to be applied. Performing this detection in an unsupervised way could be more effective as changes to systems or updates would less affect such a solution. In this thesis, we introduced an unsupervised approach to detecting error patterns in a system using its data. More specifically, the thesis investigates the use of both event logs and resource utilization data to detect error patterns. It addresses both the spatial and temporal aspects of achieving system dependability. The proposed unsupervised error detection method has been applied on real data from two different production systems. The results are positive; showing average detection F-measure of about 75...|$|R
40|$|The Early Cretaceous Hohhot {{metamorphic}} core complex (mcc) of the Daqing Shan (Mtns.) {{of central}} Inner Mongolia {{is among the}} best exposed and most spectacular of the spatially isolated mcc’s that developed within {{the northern edge of}} the North China “craton”. All of these mcc’s were formed within the basement of a Late Paleozoic Andean-style arc and across older Mesozoic fold-and-thrust belts of variable age and tectonic vergence. The master Hohhot detachment <b>fault</b> <b>roots</b> southwards within the southern margin of the Daqing Shan for an along-strike distance of at least 120  km. Its geometry in the range to the north is complicated by interference patterns between (1) primary, large-scale NW-SE-trending convex and concave fault corrugations and (2) secondary ENE-WSW-trending antiforms and synforms that folded the detachment in its late kinematic history. As in the Whipple Mtns. of California, the Hohhot master detachment is not of the Wernicke (1981) simple rooted type; instead, it was spawned from a mid-crustal shear zone, the top of which is preserved as a mylonitic front within Carboniferous metasedimentary rocks in its exhumed lower plate. 40 Ar– 39 Ar dating of siliceous volcanic rocks in basal sections of now isolated supradetachment basins suggest that crustal extension began at ca. 127  Ma, although lower-plate mylonitic rocks were not exposed to erosion until after ca. 119  Ma. Essentially synchronous cooling of hornblende, biotite, and muscovite in footwall mylonitic gneisses indicates very rapid exhumation and at ca. 122 – 120  Ma. Contrary to several recent reports, the master detachment clearly cuts across and dismembers older, north-directed thrust sheets of the Daqing Shan foreland fold-and-thrust belt. Folded and thrust-faulted basalts within its foredeep strata are as young as 132. 6  ±  2. 4  Ma, thus defining within 5 – 6  Ma the regional tectonic transition between crustal contraction and profound crustal extension...|$|R

Because some software is life and property critical, thorough analysis techniques are essential. Independently Petri nets and fault trees serve limited evaluation purposes. This thesis presents a technique that converts and links Petri nets to fault trees and fault trees to Petri nets. It enjoys the combinational benefits of both analysis tools. Software Fault Tree Analysis and timed Petri nets facilitate software safety analysis in heterogeneous multiprocessor control systems. Analysis use a Petri net to graphically organize the selected software. A fault tree supports a hazardous condition with subsequent leaf node paths {{that lead to the}} hazard. Through the combination of Petri nets and fault trees, an analyst can determine a software fault if he can reach an undesired Petri net state, comparable with the <b>fault</b> tree <b>root</b> <b>fault,</b> from an initial marking. All transitions leading to the undesired state from the initial marking must be enabled and the states must be marked that represent the leaf nodes of the fault tree path. It is not the intention of this thesis to suggest that an analyst be replaced by an automated tool. There must be analyst interaction focusing the analyst's insight and experience on the hazards of a system. This method is proposed only as a tool for evaluation during the overall safety analysis.

40|$|International audienceTwo major {{types of}} passive margins are recognized, i. e. {{volcanic}} and non-volcanic, without proposing distinctive mechanisms for their formation. Volcanic passive margins {{are associated with}} the extrusion and intrusion of large volumes of magma, predominantly mafic, and represent distinctive features of Larges Igneous Provinces, in which regional fissural volcanism predates localized syn-magmatic break-up of the lithosphere. In contrast with non-volcanic margins, continentward-dipping detachment faults accommodate crustal necking at both conjugate volcanic margins. These <b>faults</b> <b>root</b> on a two-layer deformed ductile crust that appears to be partly of igneous nature. This lower crust is exhumed up {{to the bottom of the}} syn-extension extrusives at the outer parts of the margin. Our numerical modelling suggests that strengthening of deep continental crust during early magmatic stages provokes a divergent flow of the ductile lithosphere away from a central continental block, which becomes thinner with time due to the flow-induced mechanical erosion acting at its base. Crustal-scale faults dipping continentward are rooted over this flowing material, thus isolating micro-continents within the future oceanic domain. Pure-shear type deformation affects the bulk lithosphere at VPMs until continental breakup, and the geometry of the margin is closely related to the dynamics of an active and melting mantle. In general terms, if we consider frictional and non-linear ductile behavior of rocks and extension rates of the order of a few cm/yr, the extension of " normal " continental lithosphere requires high levels of differential stresses 1 – 3. However, passive margins record events that end with continental break-up, when the integrated strength of rifted lithosphere drops to zero 1, 3. The role of magma intrusion in favoring and focusing extension may be important as the lithosphere can be both thermally weakened by hypothetical lithospheric-scale dykes 4 or compositionally strengthened in lower crustal section by cooled mafic intrusions 5. The distinction between between the volcanic (VPMs) and non-volcanic (in this case, sedimentary) passive margins (SPMs) is basically drawn on the basis of timing and degree of mantle melting in relation to lithosphere extension, break-up and plate separation 6 –...|$|R

40|$|Title: The Development of Medical Liability in Germany 1800 - 1945 Author: Colm Peter McGrath, Corpus Christi College Abstract: This thesis {{examines}} {{the development of}} medical liability in Germany during its intense formative period from 1800 - 1945. The focus is on how the fault requirement in civil law was conceptualised and applied to liability for errors in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} a patient. By focusing {{on the development of the}} law, and how it related and responded to changes in the nature of medicine, medical practitioners and healthcare over this period, this thesis uncovers a rich interaction between the legal and medical narratives of fault. In doing so, it offers an account of legal development where the law and lawyers were deeply embedded in, and influenced by, that broader social context. It identifies a gradual shift towards asserting courts’ independence from the medical narrative alongside greater willingness to question accepted practice, particularly in light of medical advances. The thesis says nothing directly about the closely related topic of liability for failure to secure the patient’s consent. We begin by mapping medicine and medical practice during this period. We then consider the evolution of ‘internal’ regulatory mechanisms and conceptions of error, in particular discussion over how to define a ‘Kunstfehler’ during the nineteenth century. We then unpack how the legal relationship between practitioner and patient was framed in nineteenth century Germany in criminal law, contract law and the law of delict before analysing the attendant standards of care and their application. Finally, we examine the changes wrought by the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch and the growth of medical liability and technology in the first half of the twentieth century. The thesis offers a heavily contextualised study of legal development in a core area of private law and concludes that the pattern of development here was driven by acceptance of, and eventually reaction against, a concept of <b>fault</b> <b>rooted</b> in the medical discourse.

40|$|The geodynamic {{evolution}} of the Central America {{is the result of}} complex interactions between the North American and South American plates, the Cocos plate and the evolving Caribbean plates, including minor crustal fragments as the Chortis block. The plates are delimited by important suture zones with continental transform faults. The central part of the Chortis block, is crossed, for more than 300 km, by the right lateral strike-slip Guayape fault. This structure is orientated NE-SW and present a strong morphological evidence of neotectonic activity. In the Canaan and Juticalpa valleys in Central Honduras, several intermountain basins bounded by extensional faults, are located along the fault strand. The region is characterized by ore deposits related to the Cenozoic magmatic activity which produced the volcanic arc extending from Guatemala to Costa Rica. In the studied area the gold and sulphide mineralizations are hosted within quartz veins of few decimetres thick, occurring in low grade metamorphic rocks, mainly well foliated graphitic and sericitic schists and quartzites. The veins are arranged in extensional meshes oriented NNW interlinked with the main strike-slip semi-brittle shear zones. The mineralization were produced by hydrothermal fluids probably related to shallow granitoid to granodiorite intrusions. Moreover these fluids are responsible for the strong alteration of the quartz veins host rocks. Foliation, fracturing and shearing of the host rocks are connected to the strike-slip faults which are the main factors controlling both the vein-formation and alteration phenomena, and providing favourable channel ways for fluid flows. The fluid inclusions of the quartz crystals are mainly constituted, at room temperature, by four types of acqueous and non-acqueous phases. The mineralizing fluids are constituted by H 2 O-NaCl-KCl- CO 2 with small amount of CH 4 (and S) and their temperatures are in the range of 300 - 400 °C.
