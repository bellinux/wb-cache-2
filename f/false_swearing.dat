2500|$|In his Institutes of the Christian Religion, John Calvin {{sets the}} stage for {{discussing}} this commandment by noting that an oath is calling God to witness that what we say is true, and that an appropriate oath is a kind of worship of God in that it implies a profession of faith. When human testimony fails, people appeal to God as witness, as the only one able to bring hidden things to light and know what is in the heart. [...] <b>False</b> <b>swearing</b> robs God of his truth (to the observer), and therefore it is a serious matter. [...] With regard to the casual use of God's name, Calvin summarized, [...] "remember that an oath is not appointed or allowed for passion or pleasure, but for necessity." [...] He wrote that the frequency of casual use of the name of God has dulled the public conscience but that the commandment, with its penalty, still stands.|$|E

[...] This admission contradicted his sworn testimony at a March 12, 2007 pretrial hearing in which he testified under oath that he had advised Jordan of his rights. The charges dismissed were making a false official statement and <b>false</b> <b>swearing</b> and obstruction of justice. [...] On the same day prosecutors narrowed the scope of the cruelty and maltreatment charge from a three-month period to one day. Jordan was only tried on this charge based on the events of November 24, 2003 during a weapons search.|$|E

60|$|This great king, in {{the first}} year of his reign, fought nine battles with the Danes. He made some {{treaties}} with them too, by which the <b>false</b> Danes <b>swore</b> they would quit the country. They pretended to consider that they had taken a very solemn oath, in swearing this upon the holy bracelets that they wore, and which were always buried with them when they died; but they cared little for it, for they thought nothing of breaking oaths and treaties too, as soon as it suited their purpose, and coming back again to fight, plunder, and burn, as usual. One fatal winter, in the fourth year of KING ALFRED'S reign, they spread themselves in great numbers over the whole of England; and so dispersed and routed the King's soldiers that the King was left alone, and was obliged to disguise himself as a common peasant, and to take refuge in the cottage of one of his cowherds who did not know his face.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{his return}} to Rome in 21, Silius was soon caught in the {{political}} machinations at court as part of Germanicus’s faction. Through Silius’s wife, Sosia Galla, the couple had become friends with Tiberius’ daughter-in-law Agrippina the Elder. Due to their friendship with Agrippina they became innocent victims of Sejanus' treason trials. In the Senate, Silius was accused by Lucius Visellius Varro (suffect consul in 12) of being complicit in Sacrovir’s revolt, and of misappropriating money from the provincial government in Gaul. Refusing to submit a plea or to defend himself, he declared that had he not personally kept the legions on the Rhine from avenging the murder of Germanicus, Tiberius would have lost his position as Princeps. Faced with <b>false</b> witnesses <b>swearing</b> that he had robbed the Gallic provinces, Silius committed suicide in 24, and afterwards Galla was exiled. Galla's property was confiscated by the Senate and a portion was given to her children.|$|R

60|$|But, if Mildred still hesitated, Arthur did not. He {{was very}} anxious {{that they should}} be married; indeed, he almost insisted on it. The {{position}} was one that was far from being agreeable to him, for all such intimacies must, from their very nature, necessitate a certain amount of <b>false</b> <b>swearing.</b> They are throughout an acted lie; and, when the lie is acted, it must sometimes be spoken. Now, this is a state of affairs that is repugnant to an honourable man, and one that not unfrequently becomes perfectly intolerable. Many is the love-affair that comes to a sudden end because the man finds it impossible to permanently constitute himself a peregrinating falsehood. But, oddly enough, it has been found difficult to persuade the other contracting party of the validity of the excuse, and, however unjust it may be, one has known of men who have seen their defection energetically set down to more vulgar causes.|$|E
60|$|All doubts, however, {{were set}} at rest {{when we reached}} the town. For without the {{slightest}} hesitation, every one of the houses in question refused to take us in.

Then I went {{and sat down on the}} sill of the first teahouse for a base of operations--I cannot say for my headquarters, because that is just what we could not get--and gave myself up to melancholy. Meanwhile Yejiro ransacked the town, from which excursions he returned every few minutes with a fresh refusal, but the same excuse. It got so at last I could anticipate the excuse. The inn was full already--of assessors and their victims. The assessors had descended on the spot, it seemed, and the whole country-side had come to town to lie about the value of its land. I only wished the inhabitants might have chosen some other time for <b>false</b> <b>swearing.</b> For it was a sad tax on my credulity.|$|E
60|$|Soft {{as he was}} in his manner, {{he nearly}} reduced Lizzie Eustace to fainting. It seemed to her that the {{questions}} would never end. It was in vain that the magistrate pointed out to the learned gentleman that Lady Eustace had confessed her own <b>false</b> <b>swearing,</b> both at Carlisle and in London, a dozen times. He continued his questions over and over again, harping chiefly on the affair at Carlisle, and saying very little as to the second robbery in Hertford Street. His idea was to make it appear that Lizzie had arranged the robbery with the view of defrauding Mr. Camperdown, and that Lord George Carruthers was her accomplice. He even asked her, almost in a whisper, and with the sweetest smile, whether she was not engaged to marry Lord George. When Lizzie denied this, he still suggested that some such alliance might be in contemplation. Upon this, Frank Greystock called upon the magistrate to defend Lady Eustace from such unnecessary vulgarity, and there was a scene in the court. Lizzie did not like the scene, but it helped to protect her from the contemplation of the public, who of course were much gratified by high words between two barristers.|$|E

Interestingly, oath breaking and the absence of just judgements for ordinary people were mentioned a number of times. British leadership, everywhere, was immoral and the cause of the [...] "ruin of Britain".|$|R
5|$|The {{election}} was {{opposed by the}} Cistercian monasteries of Yorkshire, and by the archdeacons of York. The Cistercians opposed {{on the grounds that}} the Second Lateran Council in 1139 had given the religious houses of a diocese the right to participate in the election of the bishop. Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, refused to recognise William's election due to allegations of simony, or the acquisition of church positions by bribery, and of interference by King Stephen. In 1143, Pope Innocent II ruled that William could be confirmed in office if he swore under oath that the allegations were <b>false.</b> After he <b>swore</b> the oath, Henry of Blois, who was also papal legate, found William innocent, and he was consecrated as archbishop on 26 September 1143.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was said}} by Infessura, {{and has since}} been {{repeated}} by a multitude of historians, upon no better authority than that of this writer on hearsay and inveterate gossip, that, to raise Cesare to the purple, Alexander was forced to prove the legitimacy of that young man's birth, and that to this end he procured <b>false</b> witnesses to <b>swear</b> that he was [...] "the son of Vannozza de' Catanei and her husband, Domenico d'Arignano." [...] Already has this been touched upon in an earlier chapter, here it was shown that Vannozza never had a husband {{of the name of}} d'Arignano, and it might reasonably be supposed that this circumstance alone would have sufficed to restrain any serious writer from accepting and repeating Infessura's unauthoritative statement.|$|R
60|$|It is {{remarkable}} that Herries {{did not appear}} as a witness at the trial in November. He was knighted and rewarded: every one almost was rewarded out of Gowrie’s escheats, or forfeited property. But that was natural, whether James was guilty or innocent; and we repeat that the rewards, present or in prospect, did not produce witnesses ready {{to say that they}} saw Henderson at Falkland, or in the tumult, or in the turret. Why men so freely charged with murderous conspiracy and <b>false</b> <b>swearing</b> were so dainty on these and other essential points, the advocates of the theory of perjury may explain. How James treated discrepancies in the evidence we have seen. His account was the true account, he would not alter it, he would not suppress the discrepancies of Henderson, except as to the dagger. Witnesses might say this or that to secure the King’s princely favour. Let them say: the King’s account is true. This attitude is certainly more dignified, and wiser, than the easy method of harmonising all versions before publication. Meanwhile, if there were discrepancies, they were held by sceptics to prove falsehood; if there had been absolute harmony, that would really have proved collusion. On one point I suspect suppression at the trial. Almost all versions aver that Ramsay, or another, said to Gowrie, ‘You have slain the King,’ and that Gowrie (who certainly did not mean murder) then dropped his points and was stabbed. Of this nothing is said, at the trial, by any witnesses.|$|E

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Building and Construction Law Journal [© Thomson Reuters on behalf of Lawbook Co. ]. Introduced as a measure to improve security of payment, the requirement that a head contractor provide proof that it has paid its subcontractors as a condition precedent to its own entitlement to be paid by the principal has for some time been a common provision in Australian standard form construction contracts. Recognising that allegations of some head contractors <b>swearing</b> <b>false</b> statutory declarations in relation to their contractual proof of payment obligations have been longstanding, the New South Wales Parliament has recently enacted a statutory requirement for head contractors to provide proof of payment in the building and construction industry. By examining the statutory provisions, and analysing their likely implications, this article investigates whether the proof of payment requirements are likely to have more “bite” than their contractual cousins and therefore be more effective at improving security of payment and reducing insolvencies in the building and construction industry...|$|R
