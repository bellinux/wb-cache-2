We propose a unique approach of using a power <b>gating</b> <b>switch</b> (PGS) in ultra-low regimes. Unlike the conventional manner of using PGSs, our optimization suggests using minimal-sized PGSs with a slightly higher to compensate for voltage drop across the PGS.

The present study used the event-based eye-blink rate (ebEBR), which presumably reflects phasic striatal dopamine activity, to examine how the cognitive processes of gating and updating separately facilitate flexible updating of WM contents and the potential involvement of dopamine in these processes. Real-time changes in eye blinks were tracked during performance on the reference-back task, in which demands on these two processes were independently manipulated. In all three experiments, trials that required WM updating and trials that required <b>gate</b> <b>switching</b> were both associated with increased ebEBR. These results may support the prefrontal cortex basal ganglia WM model (PBWM) by linking updating and gating to striatal dopaminergic activity.
