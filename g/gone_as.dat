5|$|In this episode, flashbacks reveal why Hurley is {{hesitant}} {{at his new}} job of distributing food {{found in}} the newly discovered Swan station. Meanwhile, a few castaways become worried that the raft sent by them for rescue may have not <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> far as they hoped. Jack and Sayid explore the hatch, while Sawyer, Jin, and Michael find out that their captors are from the tail section of the plane..|$|E
5|$|At about 3:30 or 4:00 a.m., roughly {{five minutes}} after Engine Co. 22 evacuated, the {{building}} exploded. The explosion flattened six to eight buildings, blew in the fronts of the opposite houses on Broad Street, and wrenched shutters and doors from buildings at {{some distance from the}} immediate area. It propelled bricks and other missiles through the air, threw many people down who had <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> far as Beaver Street, and spread the fire far and wide so that the whole neighborhood was set ablaze. The explosion shattered windows a mile away and was heard as far away as Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|In Alexandria, Virginia, sixteen-year-old Dara Kernof (Emily Perkins), a {{severely}} {{mentally and physically}} disabled girl confined to a wheelchair, somehow manages to leave her house {{in the middle of}} the night, soon after her baptism. Her father, Lance (Eric Keenleyside), finds her {{in the middle of the}} street, with her arms raised upward, kneeling before a Dark Figure. Suddenly, lightning flashes and the Dark Figure disappears. When Lance reaches Dara, he realizes she is dead and that her eyes are <b>gone,</b> <b>as</b> if having been burned out of their sockets.|$|E

5|$|The {{airborne}} division's next {{objective was}} now the airfield at Gioia del Colle. The Royal Air Force needed the airfield to bring in fighter aircraft from Sicily and support the landings at Salerno, which had not <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> expected. The Germans continued their withdrawal, and Gioia was reached over {{the night of the}} 16/17September, by the 10th and 156th Parachute battalions. The Royal Air Force took over the airfield and 48 hours later, six squadrons were flying from the base in support of Allied operations. Between 20 and 24September, the 1st Airborne Division was ordered to halt and construct defences on the approaches to Taranto, due to concerns that the Germans might launch a counterattack against the overextended unit.|$|E
5|$|The turuma's {{design was}} very similar {{to one of the}} other types of {{archipelago}} frigates, the hemmema. The primary difference was that hemmemas were rowed from the gundeck, providing the oarsmen with better leverage by placing them closer to the waterline. The later hemmemas were also considerably larger, more heavily armed and of a more robust construction. Naval historian Jan Glete has <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> describing them as variations on the same type, especially when considering the pre-war designs. The crew varied between 220 and 266, depending on the model. Between 128 and 152 of these were required to man all the oars.|$|E
5|$|Alonso was ever-present in {{the first}} team in the 2005–06 season, largely {{avoiding}} injuries that had marred his first season at the club. The summer transfer window brought Peter Crouch to Liverpool and the striker's height sparked accusations that the team would change to long ball tactics. Crouch denied this, highlighting that Alonso's passing ability, alongside Gerrard, would define Liverpool's style of play. Alonso faced more competition for {{his place in the}} form of new arrival Mohamed Sissoko. However, Steven Gerrard's injuries and Rafael Benítez's favouring of a 4–5–1 formation ensured Alonso's place in the team. Alonso appeared in all of Liverpool's games in the Champions League but the dominance shown in the previous season had <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> the team lost to Benfica in the knockout stage.|$|E

But if you <b>go</b> <b>as</b> a detective, <b>go</b> <b>as</b> a detective; and if you <b>go</b> <b>as</b> their friend, to help them and serve them, then go that way. But don't you try to carry water on both shoulders. If you do, I won't stir a step with you; so there!" ...|$|R

50|$|The Goodies {{decide to}} set out in a small boat {{to search for the}} Lost Island of Munga. Bill wants to go on the voyage as a pirate, Graeme decides to <b>go</b> <b>as</b> a viking and Tim <b>goes</b> <b>as</b> a captain.|$|R
5|$|An {{accomplice}} {{could be}} sued {{if he had}} provided help ope consilio – a physical act relating to the method of execution, rather than mere encouragement. It appears that Labeo {{was the first to}} require help or advice, and earlier sources suggest that both help and advice was required. Labeo's version was certainly entrenched by the early second century AD. An accomplice was treated as if he himself had committed the crime. Only one person needed to have handled the thing for all wrongdoers to be liable. Republican jurists were harder on accomplices than later jurists under the empire. Indeed, Ulpian considers the unwitting accomplice, who accidentally knocks out of the victim's hand some coins which are then stolen, an accomplice to the theft. Some commentators have <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> far to say that the veteres ("ancients") may not have even required a third party to remove the coins, {{as long as they were}} otherwise lost to the owner.|$|E
5|$|Barnes went to England in the Australian {{winter of}} 1947. In his autobiography, {{he claimed to}} have <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> a {{representative}} for an alcohol company, although appears to have dealt in commodities that were in short supply due to rationing. Once in England, he was approached by Burnley to play as a professional in Lancashire League cricket, which he did briefly before becoming disinterested and resigning. Barnes returned to Australia for the 1947–48 season, keen to win a place on the 1948 tour to England. He was worried that having played as a professional in the Lancashire League would damage his chance of further Test cricket, as the Australian authorities frowned on those who played professionally in England. There was also concern that, with his wife now living in Scotland, he would breach the Australian Board of Control's rule that wives were not allowed to travel with players, by being in the same overseas country.|$|E
5|$|Later on {{the evening}} of 7 August, she asked Bamber whether he had done it. He said no, but that a friend of his had, whom he named; the man was a plumber the family had used in the past. Bamber {{allegedly}} said he had told this friend how he could enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from the farm on one of the phones in the house that had a memory redial facility, so that if the police checked it, it would give him an alibi. Everything had <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up a fight, and the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Bamber claimed to have paid the friend £2,000.|$|E

5|$|Momolo {{returned}} to Bologna in late September 1858 after his two brothers-in-law wrote {{to him that}} if he stayed in Rome any longer the family might be ruined. He left Scazzocchio to represent the family's cause in Rome. Momolo shifted his priority to attempting to undermine Morisi's credibility, either by disproving aspects of her story or by showing her to be untrustworthy. He also resolved to confront Cesare Lepori, the grocer who Morisi said had both suggested the baptism and shown her how to perform it. Based on Morisi's story, Lepori had already been identified by many observers as being ultimately to blame for the affair. When Momolo visited his shop in early October, Lepori vehemently denied that he had ever spoken to Morisi about Edgardo or any baptism, and said that he was prepared to testify to this effect before any legal authority. He claimed that he did not himself know how to administer baptism, so had such a conversation occurred it could hardly have <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> Morisi described.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns falls {{ill with}} hypohemia (a fictional {{condition}} in which the body naturally runs out of blood, though it is akin to a real condition called hypovolemia) and needs a blood transfusion. His blood type, double O negative, is very rare, however, {{and none of the}} employees at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant have it. Homer discovers that Bart has double O negative blood and urges his son to donate, promising that he will be handsomely rewarded. Bart reluctantly agrees and his blood donation saves Mr. Burns' life. Mr. Burns is rejuvenated by the blood and he sends the Simpson family a thank you card. Enraged at Mr. Burns' paltry gesture, Homer writes an insulting reply, but Marge convinces him at the last minute not to send it. The next morning, Homer discovers that the letter is <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> Bart has mailed it.|$|E
5|$|With {{the score}} 1–0, Arsenal pushed forward but Liverpool still held the advantage. In the 74th minute an unmarked Thomas latched onto a pass from Richardson near the penalty spot, but shot weakly {{and it was}} smothered by Liverpool keeper Bruce Grobbelaar. Arsenal manager George Graham brought on Martin Hayes and Perry Groves, and {{switched}} to a more attack-oriented 4–4–2 formation. This gave Liverpool space to counter-attack through John Barnes and Aldridge. Aldridge and Ray Houghton both had late chances to equalise but did not capitalise on them; Houghton sliced a shot {{from the edge of}} the box wide, while Aldridge was caught offside meeting a Barnes throughball and scored a disallowed goal after the whistle had <b>gone.</b> <b>As</b> full-time approached the game was heading for a 1–0 scoreline, and thus Liverpool would win the title.|$|E

50|$|The {{climate is}} {{generally}} dry and healthy. The average rainfall of the taluka is 840 mm. Average number of rainy days are about 51 days. Though {{the climate is}} dry throughout the year, summer months become very hot and the temperature <b>goes</b> <b>as</b> high as 40-43 degree Celsius. The minimum temperature during winter <b>goes</b> <b>as</b> low as 15-10 degree Celsius.|$|R

25|$|While winning many travel {{industry}} awards as Best Island In The World {{in recent years}} concerns have been raised by locals and environmentalists about the overdevelopment of Maui.

25|$|Although {{one of the}} Goodmans {{had brought}} him the song to sing and record {{while he was still}} there with them, the Singing Americans felt the song had not <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> far as it could while he sang with the group.

25|$|The {{city has}} a strong {{sporting}} tradition. Football club Newcastle United has been based at St James' Park since the club was established in 1892, although any traces of the original structure are now long <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> the stadium now holds more than 52,000 seated spectators, being England's fourth largest football stadium. The city also has non-League football clubs, Newcastle Benfield, West Allotment Celtic and Team Northumbria.|$|E
25|$|This chapel {{was once}} closed by a double door now missing. It {{contained}} a wooden coffin and ointment vessels which left traces in the ground.

The few remaining items were a scepter, several arrows, and a collection of models including ships, granaries and bakeries.|$|E
