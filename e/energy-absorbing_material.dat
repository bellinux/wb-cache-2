40|$|Bending {{manipulation}} and direct force measurements of ultrathin boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) were performed inside a transmission electron microscope. Our results demonstrate an obvious transition in mechanics of BNNTs when the external diameters of nanotubes {{are in the}} range of 10 nm or less. During in situ transmission electron microscopy bending tests, characteristic "hollow" ripple-like structures formed in the bent ultrathin BNNTs with diameters of sub- 10 nm. This peculiar buckling/bending mode makes the ultrathin BNNTs hold very high post-buckling loads which significantly exceed their initial buckling forces. Exceptional compressive/bending strength as high as ∼ 1210 MPa was observed. Moreover, the analysis of reversible bending force curves of such ultrathin nanotubes indicates that they may store/adsorb strain energy at a density of ∼ 400 × 106 J m- 3.

Crumple-forming {{results in a}} mesostructured system in which mechanical properties of the material are governed by complex cross-scale deformation mechanisms. Here we investigate the physical and mechanical properties of dense compacted structures fabricated by the confined uniaxial compression of a cellulose tissue to yield crumpled mesostructuring. A total of 25 specimens of various densities were tested under compression. Crumple formed specimens exhibited densities in the range 0. 8 – 1. 3 g cm− 3, and showed high strength to weight characteristics, achieving ultimate compressive strength values of up to 200 MPa under both quasi-static and high strain rate loading conditions and deformation energy that compares well to engineering materials of similar density. The materials fabricated in this work and their mechanical attributes demonstrate the potential of crumple-forming approaches in the fabrication of novel <b>energy-absorbing</b> <b>materials</b> from low-cost precursors such as recycled paper.

40|$|In the {{representative}} {{embodiment of the}} invention disclosed, a load limiting, energy absorbing net is arranged to overlay a normally-covered vent opening in the rear bulkhead of the space orbiter vehicle. Spatially-disposed flexible retainer straps are extended from the net and respectively secured to bulkhead brackets spaced around the vent opening. The intermediate portions of the straps are doubled over and stitched together in a pattern enabling the doubled-over portions to progressively separate at a predicable load designed to be well below the tensile capability of the straps as the stitches are successively torn apart by the forces imposed on the retainer members whenever the cover plate is explosively separated from the bulkhead and propelled into the net. By arranging these stitches to be successively torn away at a load below the strap strength in response to forces acting on the retainers that are less than the combined strength of the retainers, this tearing action serves as a predictable compact energy absorber for safely halting the cover plate as the retainers are extended as the net is deployed.

40|$|AbstractMotivated {{by recent}} efforts to {{mitigate}} blast loading using <b>energy-absorbing</b> <b>materials,</b> this paper uses analytical and computational modeling {{to investigate the}} influence of mass distribution on the uniaxial crushing of cellular sandwich plates under air blast loading. In the analytical model, the cellular core is represented using a rigid, perfectly-plastic, locking idealization, as in previous studies, and {{the front and back}} faces are modeled as rigid, with pressure loading applied to the front face and the back-face unrestrained. This model is also applicable to the crushing of cellular media in “blast pendulum” experiments. Fluid–structure interaction effects are treated using a recent result that accounts for nonlinear compressibility effects for intense air blasts. Predictions of the analytical model show excellent agreement with explicit finite element computations, and the model is used to investigate the response of the system for all possible distributions of mass between the front and back faces and the cellular core. Increasing the mass fraction in the front face is found to increase the impulse required for complete crushing of the cellular core but also to produce undesirable increases in back-face accelerations. Optimal mass distributions for mitigating shock transmission through the sandwich plate are investigated by maximizing the impulse capacity while limiting the back-face accelerations to a specified level...|$|R
40|$|Due to a rise {{in global}} {{urbanization}} and motorization, pedestrian injuries {{continue to be a}} major public-health problem worldwide. To design pedestrian-friendly vehicles, knowledge of common pedestrian injuries, technologies available for reducing these injuries, and benefit estimations for these technologies are essential. In this report, we present a literature review and provide insights into vehicle designs for improving pedestrian safety. Pedestrian-injury data show that heads and lower extremities are the most commonly injured body regions in vehicle-to-pedestrian crashes, but chest injuries are the second most common injuries after head injuries to cause fatalities. Pedestrian injuries are strongly related to impact speed, pedestrian age, and vehicle type. The increased proportion of older pedestrians and SUVs will likely result in more pedestrian injuries, especially those involving the torso. Adding <b>energy-absorbing</b> <b>materials</b> to the vehicle front-end structures is the most cost-effective way of developing pedestrian-friendly vehicles. However, such improvements often conflict with other design considerations, such as styling, aerodynamics, and safety standards for low-speed crashes and rollovers. Deployable passive safety designs, such as pop-up hoods and windshield airbags, and active safety designs, such as brake-assist systems and autonomous-braking systems, have demonstrated considerable benefits for reducing pedestrian injuries. Integrated passive and active systems are recommended for a further enhancement of pedestrian protection. However, the benefits from different pedestrian-safety designs vary with different types of vehicles and pedestrians with different statures and ages. Consequently {{it is important to consider}} implementing specific safety designs to a specific vehicle for maximizing the effectiveness, and population-age profile may also play an important role in selecting pedestrian safety features...|$|R

This technology area has been under investigation {{to assist with the}} definition of risks associated with dynamic loads and to provide guidance for determining the required upgrading and retrofitting techniques suggested for reducing building and infrastructure vulnerabilities to such dynamic forces. This unique approach involves the application of risk management techniques for solving problems of the as-built environment through the application of security, safety, and reliability principles developed in the nuclear weapons programs of the United States Department of Energy (DOE) and through the protective structures programs of the German Ministry of Defense (MOD). The changing responsibilities of engineering design professionals are addressed in light of the increased public awareness of structural and facility systems' vulnerabilities to malevolent, normal, and abnormal environment conditions. Brief discussions are also presented on (1) the need to understand how dynamic pressures are affected by the structural failures they cause, (2) the need to determine cladding effects on columns, walls, and slabs, and (3) the need to establish effective standoff distance for perimeter barriers.

40|$|Each year an {{estimated}} 1. 7 million people suffer from {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI), of which 52, 000 die, 275, 000 are hospitalized, and 1. 365 million are treated and released from an emergency department. Approximately 75 % of all reported TBIs that occur are concussions {{or other forms of}} mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Concussions in football have recently received heightened attention due to prevalence at the professional, collegiate, and high school levels. With research pushing the boundaries of understanding the long-term effects of neurotrauma, there is high demand to develop better protections against traumatic brain injury. Current helmet designs are limited by a lack of novel energy-absorptive materials and outdated testing standards, which focus on a single parameter for design, as opposed to a systems approach. Ideally, energy-absorption material should be customizable to the impact energy needs in both the time domain and the frequency domain.

40|$|Lateral {{impact tests}} were {{performed}} using seven male post-mortem human subjects (whole, unembalmed cadavers) to further characterize {{the response of}} the body, and in particular the force-deflection response of the lower abdomen, to lateral impact. All tests were performed using a dual-sled, side-impact test facility. A multi-segmented impactor was mounted on a sled that was pneumatically accelerated into a second, initially stationary sled on which a cadaver subject was seated facing perpendicular to the direction of impact. Sizes and heights of impactor segments were adjusted for each subject so that forces applied to different anatomic regions including thorax, abdomen, greater trochanter, iliac wing, and thigh could be independently measured on each cadaver. For all tests, the impactor contact surfaces were located in the same vertical plane except that the abdomen plate was offset 5. 1 cm toward the subject. Each subject was first impacted {{on one side of the}} body using an initial impactor speed of 3 m/s. Following the five of these tests that did not result in injury, the contralateral side of the body was impacted at a speed of either 8 m/s or 10 m/s. The masses of the sleds and the force-deflection characteristics of the <b>energy-absorbing</b> <b>material</b> that acted as the interface between the sleds were set so that the velocity history of the impactor sled matched the average driver door velocity history produced in a series of side NCAP tests. Impactor padding was also selected so that average ATD pelvis and thorax responses from the same series of side NCAP tests were reproduced when the ATD used in these tests was impacted using the average door-velocity history. Results of these tests were used to develop force-deflection response targets for the abdomen, force history response targets for the pelvis (iliac wing and greater trochanter), the midthigh, and the thorax at each of the three impact velocities. Response targets for the lateral acceleration of the pelvis were also developed. Future work will compare side impact ATD responses to these response targets...|$|E

40|$|Materials Science and Engineering, a {{young and}} vibrant {{discipline}} with its inception in the 1950 s, has expanded into three directions: metals, polymers, and ceramics (and their mixtures, composites). Beyond the traditional scope, biological materials have drawn much attention since 1990 s due to their optimal structures, which rise from hundreds of million years of evolution. Generally, biological materials are complex composites and possess varieties of hierarchical structures, multifunctionality, self-organization and self-assembly. From {{the point of view}} of mechanics, mechanical properties of natural (or biological) materials are outstanding, although their constituent materials are weak. This is because the necessary mechanical support is in great need due to their surrounding environment. Therefore, their efficiency provides us with useful indications as to how to synthesize new materials inspired by natural ones, and thus drives scientists and engineers to reveal the mechanisms behind the observed phenomena of interest. In this regard, the tendency in the design of novel materials apparently holds a promising future in new Material Science. To date, it is widely accepted that the research on biological materials is a multidisciplinary field including chemistry, physics, and biology etc. Although some progress has been already made, there is still a long way to go to mass fabricate bio-inspired materials. In this thesis, employing a "bottom-up" approach, we have devised three hierarchical models (2 -D hierarchical woven, 2 -D hierarchical honeycomb and 3 -D hierarchical foam) inspired by structures found in natural materials and investigated their mechanical properties. The common characteristic of these structures is their being quasi-self-similar. Regarding the derivation of their mechanical properties, we consider the (n- 1) th level structure to be a continuous medium and from it we calculate the mechanical properties of the nth level structure. In the first chapter, we introduce the motivation for this work. By reviewing the literature on both well-studied and less familiar natural materials, we summarize their structural characteristics and biomechanical mechanisms. Chapter 2 deals with our first model— 1 -D or 2 -D hierarchical woven tissue, and the elastic anisotropy of the structure is derived, based on the well-known stiffness averaging method by volumes. In order to verify the theory, an experiment on leaves, which are modeled as one-dimensional hierarchical woven structures, is performed. Also, a comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental data on tendons from the literature is made. The considered structure could be used as a scaffold, which can provide the mechanical support and optimize tissue regeneration at each hierarchical level. Chapters 3 - 5 discuss our second model— 2 -D hierarchical honeycomb. Incorporating the surface effect, the in-plane linear-elastic properties, elastic buckling properties, fracture strength and toughness are derived. Chapter 3 examines the linear elastic properties and the stiffness efficiency thanks to the minimum-weight analysis, and the parametric analysis shows that the structure can be optimized. Chapter 4 discusses elastic buckling by employing the Euler buckling formula; besides local buckling, progressive buckling is also investigated. The progressive failure behavior is found to be similar to that of balsa wood. Strength efficiency is also illustrated. Employing "Quantized Fracture Mechanics" (Pugno, 2002; Pugno and Ruoff, 2004), Chapter 5 modifies the classical strength formulas of the conventional honeycomb and investigates the defective hierarchical honeycomb; the fracture toughness of the perfect and defective hierarchical honeycomb are both derived. In general, hierarchical honeycombs can be used as <b>energy-absorbing</b> <b>materials</b> and bioscaffolds for directional tissue regeneration. Chapter 6 models our third hierarchical structure— 3 -D hierarchical foam. The Young's modulus and plastic strength are derived based on structural analysis. When the characteristic size of the lowest level is very small (less than 10 nm), surface effects play an important role in determining the mechanical properties of the structure. The hierarchical foam could be used as nano-porous gold. Chapter 7 provides conclusions and an outlook for future wor...|$|R

40|$|The {{metallurgical}} {{processes and}} the products developed from these processes {{have been the}} cornerstone on which our civilizations have developed and flourished. Many of the new materials {{that have been developed}} over centuries were often the result of serendipitous occurrences. Because of the importance of new materials to the improvement of society, it is necessary to accelerate the way in which new alloys and processes are designed, developed and implemented. 	Over the last two decades the computational side of materials science has thrived as a result of bigger and faster computers. However, the application of new computational methods to the development of new materials and structures is still in the early stages primarily because of the complexity of most metallurgical processes. One such process is the decarburization of steel. Because {{of the importance of the}} microstructure on the mechanical properties, changes in the near surface properties are affected by the loss of carbon in the alloy. The topics investigated in this thesis include a variety of alloys and microstructures that are considered to be important in the development of a unique structure necessary for a more efficient method of recovering natural gas and oil from underground reserves as well as structures for energy absorbing systems. Since both the material application and the structure are new, this research represents an ideal opportunity to combine processing, properties, microstructure and computations to accelerate the development of these new structures. 	Compared to other commercially available proppants which tend to fail in demanding environments, the thin-walled hollow metal proppants are regarded more promising due to the low density and high mechanical strength. The <b>energy-absorbing</b> composite <b>material</b> manufactured by embedding said spheres in the Mg/Al matrix material is optimized by improving sphere and matrix properties at each step in the process. Ultimately the mechanical strength, fracture toughness, and energy absorption are expected to achieve a factor of 2 - 5 higher than previously reported. 	Modeling makes it economically practical to assess the targeted materials' overall properties, behaviors and the mechanical responses in conjunction with stress environment, material properties, material dimensions among other variables, before a structure is built. Additionally, more advanced modeling can enable the quantitative descriptions of more complex metallurgical phenomena such as the effects of impurity elements and deformation under complex loading conditions.
