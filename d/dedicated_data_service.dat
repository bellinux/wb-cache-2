40|$|Environmental {{research}} infrastructures (RIs) support data-intensive research by integrating large-scale sensor/observer networks with <b>dedicated</b> <b>data</b> curation <b>services</b> and analytical tools. However {{the diversity of}} scientific disciplines coupled {{with the lack of}} an accepted methodology for constructing new RIs inevitably leads to incompatibilities between the data models, metadata standards and service descriptions used by different RIs, inhibiting their usefulness for interdisciplinary research. In the absence of a common global ontology of science and infrastructure, these inconsistencies may best be counteracted by selectively bridging the semantics of the various vocabularies, standards and models used by the RIs at present. Open Information Linking for Environmental RIs (OIL-E) was developed within the FP 7 project ENVRI to provide a framework for semantic linking of knowledge resources used by different environmental RIs. Built around a multi-viewpoint reference model ENVRI-RM, OIL-E is intended to act as a central exchange for linking information fragments and identifying gaps in the conceptual models of RIs...|$|R
40|$|EDITOR’S SUMMARY: A {{review of}} {{research}} data and library <b>data</b> <b>services</b> presented on the websites of 206 top research universities as of July 2014 provided insights into policies and practices. Limited to publicly accessible information, the review indicated {{about half of}} the surveyed libraries offer some type of <b>data</b> <b>services</b> beyond a resource guide, about four in 10 had a librarian fully or partly <b>dedicated</b> to <b>data</b> management support and about one in 10 had a <b>dedicated</b> <b>data</b> repository. Institutions are likely to have a specific data policy if they are more involved in research and have higher research spending, have larger faculties and offer <b>data</b> <b>services</b> or a <b>data</b> librarian. Significant concern about data ownership and other legal issues is apparent. There is need for broad further development of policies, best practices and education about library <b>data</b> <b>services,</b> with librarians as the appropriate leaders...|$|R
40|$|Current data-centers lack in {{efficient}} {{support for}} intelligent <b>services,</b> such as <b>data</b> sharing, resource monitoring, controlling overload scenarios, etc., {{which has become}} a common requirement today. Researchers and several organizations have been working towards adding co-processing units (such as FPGAs) in the hardware to offload some of the features of such intelligent services. However, at this point of time, it is not clear on how much benefits such co-processing units can provide to the data-center applications. On the other hand, as multicore systems are emerging, it opens up new ways to design, implement and emulate such co-processing units with the help of multiple cores in the system. To study the performance benefits, in this paper, we onload some of the prime functionalities of data-center services to dedicated cores. Specifically, we onload the data sharing and resource monitoring services to a dedicated core in a multi-core system and analyze the performance benefits in terms of Inter Process Communication (IPC) costs, overhead in response time and execution time of several applications. Our micro-benchmark results show that the performance of the <b>dedicated</b> <b>data</b> sharing <b>service</b> can be improved by 25 % as compared to existing implementation. Evaluations with dedicated resource monitoring service show that the dedicated core can avoid fluctuations in response time compared to existing implementation. Distributed STORM and application checkpointing over the <b>data</b> sharing <b>service</b> show up to 15 % and 33 % improvement, respectively, as compared to the existing implementation. ...|$|R

To enhance the quality of real-time <b>data</b> <b>services</b> even in the presence of dynamic workloads, feedback control theory has been applied.

An interesting approach to define the semantics of <b>data</b> <b>services</b> is by describing them as semantic views over a domain ontology.

To date, such services have typically been generic, rather than discipline-specific, {{to appeal to a}} wide variety of researchers. Methods: An online survey was deployed to identify trends regarding research <b>data</b> <b>services</b> in veterinary medicine libraries. Participants were identified from a list of contacts from the MLA Veterinary Medical Libraries Section. Results: Although many respondents indicated that they have a professional interest in research <b>data</b> <b>services,</b> the majority of veterinary medicine librarians only rarely or occasionally provide data management support as part of their regular job responsibilities. There was little consensus as to whether research <b>data</b> <b>services</b> should be core to a library’s mission despite their perceived importance to the advancement of veterinary research. Furthermore, most respondents stated that research <b>data</b> <b>services</b> are just as or somewhat less important than the other services that they provide and feel only slightly or somewhat prepared to offer such services. Conclusions: Lacking a standard definition of ‘‘research data’’ and a common understanding of precisely what research <b>data</b> <b>services</b> encompass, it is difficult for veterinary medicine librarians and libraries to define and understand their roles in research <b>data</b> <b>services.</b> Nonetheless, they appear to have an interest in learning more about and providing research <b>data</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R
