40|$|Abstract The {{progressive}} {{destruction of}} articular cartilage {{is one of}} the hallmarks of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Cartilage degradation is attributed to different classes of catabolic factors, including proinflammatory cytokines, aggrecanases, matrix metalloproteinases, and nitric oxide. Recently, matrix degradation products generated by excessive proteolysis in arthritis have been found to mediate cartilage destruction. These proteolytic fragments activate chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts via specific cell surface receptors that can stimulate catabolic intracellular signaling pathways, leading to the induction of such catalysts. This review describes the catabolic activities of matrix degradation products, especially fibronectin fragments, and discusses the pathologic implication in cartilage destruction in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Increased levels of these degradation products, found in diseased joints, may stimulate cartilage breakdown by mechanisms of the kind demonstrated in the review. <b>Key</b> words Cartilage <b>destruction</b> · Fibronectin fragment (FN-f) · Integrin · Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) ...|$|R

ABSTRACT: Cloud computing focuses on maximizing {{the effectiveness of the}} sharing of resources. It is not only shared by multiple users but can also dynamically reallocating as per demand. Cloud computing is the notion of outsourcing on-site available services and data storage to an off-site. Personal data stored in the cloud may contain account number, password, notes and other important information that could be used and misused by a miscreant, a competitor or a court of law. These data are cached, copied and archived by Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), often without user authorization and control. To overcome this problem to propose a Self Destruction method is protecting the user data privacy through Shamir Secret sharing algorithm, which can generate a pair of <b>keys.</b> Self <b>Destruction</b> method is associated with Time to Live (TTL) property to specify the life time of the keys. TTL trigger the Self Destruction operation, then the keys becomes destructed or unreadable after a user specified period. User can decrypt after timeout, either the user give correct keys. Shamir algorithm generates new keys to the user. Self Destruction mechanism reduces the overhead during upload and download file in the cloud. The result demonstrates that Self Destruction is practical to use and meet all privacy preserving goals.

40|$|To whom {{correspondence}} may {{be addressed}} We hypothesize {{that the energy}} strategy of a cell is a key factor for determining how, or if, the immune system interacts with that cell. Cells have {{a limited number of}} metabolic states, in part, {{depending on the type of}} fuels the cell consumes. Cellular fuels include glucose (carbohydrates), lipids (fats), and proteins. We propose that the cell’s ability to switch to, and efficiently use, fat for fuel confers immune privilege. Additionally, because uncoupling proteins are involved in the fat burning process and reportedly in protection from free radicals, we hypothesize that uncoupling proteins play an important role in immune privilege. Thus, changes in metabolism (caused by oxidative stresses, fuel availability, age, hormones, radiation, or drugs) will dictate and initiate changes in immune recognition and in the nature of the immune response. This has profound implications for controlling the symptoms of autoimmune diseases, for preventing graft rejection, and for targeting tumor cells for <b>destruction.</b> <b>Key</b> words: immune privilege, cell metabolism, uncoupling proteins, lipids, co-stimulation, mitochondria, apoptosi...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Stratospheric ozone {{depletion}} through catalytic chemistry involving man-made chlorofluorocarbons {{is an area}} of focus in the study of geophysics and one of the global environmental issues of the twentieth century. This review presents a brief history of the science of {{ozone depletion}} and describes a conceptual framework to explain the key processes involved, with a focus on chemistry. Observations that may be considered as evidence (fingerprints) of ozone depletion due to chlorofluorocarbons are explored, and the related gas phase and surface chemistry is described. Observations of ozone and of chlorine-related trace gases near 40 km provide evidence that gas phase chemistry has indeed currently depleted about 10 % of the stratospheric ozone there as predicted, and the vertical and horizontal struc-tures of this depletion are fingerprints for that process. More striking changes are observed each austral spring in Antarctica, where about half of the total ozone column is depleted each September, forming the Antarctic ozone hole. Measurements of large amounts of C 10, a <b>key</b> ozone <b>destruction</b> catalyst, are among the finger-prints showing that human releases of chlorofluorocarbons are the primary cause of this change. Enhanced ozone depletion in the Antarctic and Arctic regions is linked to heterogeneous chlorine chemistry that occurs on the surfaces of polar stratospheric clouds at cold temperatures. Observations also show that some of the same heterogeneous chemistry occurs on the surfaces of particles present at midlatitudes as well, and the abundances of these particles are enhanced following explosive volcanic eruptions. The partitioning of chlorine between active forms that destroy ozone and inert reservoirs that sequester it is a central part of the framework for our understanding of the 40 -km ozone decline, the Antarctic ozone hole, the recent Arctic ozone losses in particularly cold years, and the observation of record midlatitude ozone depletion after the major eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the early 1990 s. As human use of chlorofluorocarbons continues to decrease, these changes throughout the ozone layer are expected to gradually reverse during the twenty-first century. 1...|$|R

Moisture content, pH, total organic carbon, organic matter, available Nitrogen and P decreased with increasing soil depth. All the soil parameters were higher in undisturbed site than the disturbed site, which is an indication of better productivity of the site. Negative correlation was found between soil depth and mycorrhizal count both for live and dead mycorrhiza.

Correlation between mycorrhizal counts (live and dead total) and available Nitrogen, organic matter and Phosphorus were highly significant.

Limiting the scope to the two originally detected planets, we assess the dynamical stability of the system and find no evidence for bounded chaos in the orbital motion. The orbital eccentricity of the planets b and c is found to change cyclically in the range 0. 06 – 0. 28 and 0. 05 – 0. 25, respectively, with a period of approximately 0. 46 yr. Taking the eccentricity variation into account, numerical integrations are performed of the spin-orbit interactions of the planet GJ 667 Cc with its host star, assuming a terrestrial composition of its mantle.

Type I collagen provides the lung's tensile strength, is extremely resistant to degradation, but is cleaved by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 1. Fibroblasts potentially secrete quantitatively more MMP- 1 than other lung cells. We investigated mechanisms regulating Mtb-induced collagenolytic activity in fibroblasts in vitro and in patients. Lung fibroblasts were stimulated with conditioned media from Mtb-infected monocytes (CoMTb). CoMTb induced sustained increased MMP- 1 (74 versus 16 ng/ml) and decreased tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) - 1 (8. 6 versus 22. 3 ng/ml) protein secretion. CoMTb induced a 2. 7 -fold increase in MMP- 1 promoter activation and a 2. 5 -fold reduction in TIMP- 1 promoter activation at 24 hours (P = 0. 01). Consistent with this, TIMP- 1 did not co-localize with fibroblasts in patient granulomas. MMP- 1 up-regulation and TIMP- 1 down-regulation were p 38 (but not extracellular signal–regulated kinase or c-Jun N-terminal kinase) mitogen-activated protein kinase–dependent. STAT 3 phosphorylation was detected in fibroblasts in vitro and in tuberculous granulomas. STAT 3 inhibition reduced fibroblast MMP- 1 secretion by 60 % (P = 0. 046).

Ya. Horbachevsky State Medical University”, Ternopil, Ukraine Summary Ultrastructural myocardial changes are the first signs that let characterizing morphological features of various pathological processes morphogenesis, including metabolic cardiomyopathy. It was defined that in animals of pubertal period hyperuricemia and its combination with hypercholesterolemia led to myocardial hyperfunction, which manifested mainly by hyperplasia of different cellular ultrastructures. Among adult animals in modelled metabolic deviations could be noted degenerative myocardial changes that appeared as partial or total organelles <b>destruction.</b> <b>Key</b> words: myocardium, hyperuricemia, ultrastructure, experiment...|$|R
