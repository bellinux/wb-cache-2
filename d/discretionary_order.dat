25|$|Lee's {{order has}} been criticized because it left too much {{discretion}} to Ewell. Historians such as McPherson have speculated on how the more aggressive Stonewall Jackson would have acted on this order if he had lived to command this wing of Lee's army, and how differently {{the second day of}} battle would have proceeded with Confederate possession of Culp's Hill or Cemetery Hill. <b>Discretionary</b> <b>orders</b> were customary for General Lee because Jackson and James Longstreet, his other principal subordinate, usually reacted to them very well and could use their initiative to respond to conditions and achieve the desired results. Ewell's critics have noted that this failure of action on his part, whether justified or not, in all likelihood cost the Confederates the battle. Other historians have noted that Lee, as the overall commanding general who issued <b>discretionary</b> <b>orders</b> to Ewell and then continued the battle for another two days, bears the final responsibility for the Confederate defeat at Gettysburg.|$|R

Few of Lee's subsequent corps commanders had this ability. At Gettysburg, this resulted in lost opportunities.

Ewell, <b>discretionary</b> <b>orders</b> that the heights (Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill) be taken [...] "if practicable."

25|$|As Confederate General Robert E.

During a series of cavalry actions in mid-June 1863, Stuart's force largely accomplished this assignment but was surprised and fought on even terms for the first time by Union cavalry at the Battle of Brandy Station and the Battle of Upperville on June 9 and June 21. As {{the main body of the}} Confederate Army was passing into Maryland and Pennsylvania, Stuart persuaded Lee to give him <b>discretionary</b> <b>orders</b> to take three brigades of his cavalry through and around the Union Army in order to gather supplies and intelligence and to damage the Army of the Potomac's communications and supply lines.

2500|$|The two armies {{began to}} collide at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863. The first day {{proceeded}} in three phases as combatants continued {{to arrive at}} the battlefield. In the morning, two brigades of Confederate Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division (of Hill's Third Corps) were delayed by dismounted Union cavalrymen under Brig. Gen. John Buford. As infantry reinforcements arrived under Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds from the I Corps, the Confederate assaults down the Chambersburg Pike were repulsed, although Gen. Reynolds was killed. By early afternoon, the Union XI Corps had arrived, and the Union position was in a semicircle from west to north of the town. Ewell's Second Corps began a massive assault from the north, with Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes's division attacking from Oak Hill and Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early's division attacking across the open fields north of town.

40|$|The Australian Federal Police has {{in recent}} years become an {{important}} actor in both the implementation and design of Australian-led state building interventions in Australia's near region of Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. The article focuses on the recent expansion of the Australian Federal Police {{as a way of}} understanding {{the emergence of a new}} partly (and strategically) deterritorialized, 'regional' frontier of the Australian state. Within this new frontier, whose fluctuating outlines the Australian Federal Police not only polices but also to a considerable extent shapes and reshapes, as one of the primary expert agencies on identifying and managing transnational security risks, Australian security is portrayed as contingent on the quality of the domestic governance of neighbouring states, thereby creating linkages between the hitherto domestic governing apparatus of the Australian state and those of other countries. This allows for the rearticulation of the problems affecting intervened states and societies - indeed, their very social and political structures - in the depoliticized terms of the breakdown of 'law and order' and the absence of 'good governance', which not only rationalizes emergency interventions to stabilize volatile situations, but also delegitimizes and potentially criminalizes oppositional politics. The Australian Federal Police, however, does more than merely provide justification for intrusive state transformation projects. Its transnational policing activities open up a field of governance within the apparatus of intervened states that exists in separation from international and domestic law. The constitution of such interventions 'within' the state leaves intact the legal distinction between the domestic and international spheres and therefore circumvents the difficult issue of sovereignty. As a result, police and other executive-administrative actors obtain <b>discretionary</b> <b>ordering</b> powers, without dislodging the sovereign governments of intervened countries...|$|R

An important innovation of our approach is that we isolate the effects of exchange rate, supply and demand shocks by analysing the conditional variance of macroeconomic variables. We show that monetary policy should be more activist in response to exchange rate shocks for a flexible aggregate inflation target than for a flexible non-traded inflation target. However, in response to demand and supply shocks monetary policy is more activist for a flexible non-traded inflation target. The result is robust to the inclusion of forward-looking expectations, gradual exchange rate pass-through, and <b>discretionary</b> policy.
