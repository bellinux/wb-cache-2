40|$|Objectives: Low patency {{rates of}} saphenous vein grafts remain a major predicament in {{surgical}} revascularization. We examined a novel <b>expandable</b> external <b>support</b> <b>device</b> designed to mitigate causative factors for {{early and late}} graft failure. Methods: For this study, fourteen adult sheep underwent cardiac revascularization using two vein grafts for each; one to the LAD {{and the other to}} the obtuse marginal artery. One graft was <b>supported</b> with the <b>device</b> while the other served as a control. Target vessel was alternated between consecutive cases. The animals underwent immediate and late angiography and were then sacrificed for histopathologic evaluation. Results: Of the fourteen animals studied, three died peri-operatively (unrelated to device implanted), and ten survived the follow-up period. Among surviving animals, three grafts were thrombosed and one was occluded, all in the control group (p[*]=[*] 0. 043). Quantitative angiographic evaluation revealed no difference between groups in immediate level of graft uniformity, with a coefficient-of-variance (CV%) of 7. 39 in control versus 5. 07 in the supported grafts, p[*]=[*] 0. 082. At 12  weeks, there was a significant non-uniformity in the control grafts versus the supported grafts (CV[*]=[*] 22. 12 versus 3. 01, p[*]<[*] 0. 002). In histopathologic evaluation, mean intimal area of the supported grafts was significantly lower than in the control grafts (11. 2  mm^ 2 versus 23. 1  mm^ 2 p[*]<[*] 0. 02). Conclusions: The <b>expandable</b> SVG external <b>support</b> system was found to be efficacious in reducing SVG’s non-uniform dilatation and neointimal formation in an animal model early after CABG. This novel technology may have the potential to improve SVG patency rates after surgical myocardial revascularization...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis study {{investigated}} the effects on global cardiac function and myocardial energetics of limiting progressive dilatation after infarction {{by means of a}} woven polyester jacket cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device.</b> We hypothesized that placement of the cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> results in a decrease in myocardial wall stress and improvement in cardiac function and myocardial energetics. MethodsTo investigate the effect of passive constraint on left ventricular function and mechanics, a total of 10 sheep were studied with pressure-volume analysis and magnetic resonance imaging. A baseline study was followed by the creation of an anterior infarct. After 1 week, the animals underwent a second study. The cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> was then placed over the epicardium in 5 sheep; the remaining animals served as controls. A terminal study was performed at 2 months after the infarct. ResultsThe cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> group at the terminal study exhibited a decrease in end-diastolic volume (control 110. 3 ± 19. 8 mL vs cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> 67. 6 ± 4. 7 mL, P =. 006) and an improved ejection fraction (control 15. 5 % ± 5. 7 % vs cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> 29. 46 % ± 4. 42 %, P =. 008) relative to the control group. Myocardial energetics were also enhanced in the cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> group, as evidenced by the significant improvements in potential energy (control 2015 ± 503 mL · mm Hg/beat vs cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> 885 ± 220 mL · mm Hg/beat, P =. 006), efficiency (control 39. 4 % ± 13. 6 % vs cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> 59. 8 % ± 8. 5 %, P =. 044), and oxygen consumption (control 0. 072 ± 0. 013 mL O 2 /beat vs cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> 0. 052 ± 0. 007 mL O 2 /beat, P =. 034). ConclusionPassive constraint with the cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> after infarct prevents further remodeling and may stimulate reverse remodeling in heart failure secondary to acute myocardial infarction. These results suggest that in human beings placement of the cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> after a large anterior myocardial infarction may be effective in halting the remodeling process that often leads to end-stage heart failure. If proved effective, placement of a cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> after large heart attacks has the potential to decrease the incidence of heart failure that results after large myocardial infarctions...|$|R

40|$|Heart {{failure is}} a growing health problem, {{affecting}} {{an increasing number of}} patients with rapidly increasing costs for the health care system. In spite of recent improvements in pharmacological, non-pharmacological and surgical treatments the prognosis for patients with severe heart failure is still poor. Heart failure is associated with numerous processes and changes in left ventricular structure and function often referred to as left ventricular remodelling. The Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> is a mesh-like polyester device designed to arrest and reverse these processes thereby facilitating left ventricular reversed remodelling in heart failure. We have explored the effect of passive containment surgery using the Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> in heart failure patients with ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Following application of the Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> reduced cardiac dimensions, increased functional capacity, decreased levels of circulating plasma levels of Endothelin- I and improved quality of life was demonstrated. Furthermore, the possible beneficial effect on reduction on left ventricular dilatation with application of the Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> concomitant with aortic valve replacement in patients with longstanding aortic regurgitation and left ventricular dilatation was evaluated. No additive beneficial effects of application of the Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> were found in these patients when compared to patients with chronic aortic regurgitation and left ventricular dilatation undergoing aortic valve replacement as the sole procedure. The acute effects of application of the Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> in experimental porcine myocardial infarction were investigated. No acute effect on hemodynamics, coronary vasomotor function, Endothelin- I levels or infarction size was demonstrated following application of the Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> at induction of acute experimental myocardial infarction. Based on the findings in these studies it is concluded that application of the Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> is safe, simple and without apparent negative effects. In heart failure patients with ventricular dilatation the Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> represents a novel and interesting amendment to current surgical treatment options with likely beneficial effects...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundThe cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> <b>supports</b> {{the heart}} and {{mechanically}} reduces left ventricular (LV) diastolic wall stress. Although {{it has been shown}} to halt LV remodeling in dilated cardiomyopathy, its therapeutic efficacy is limited by its lack of biological effects. In contrast, the slow-release synthetic prostacyclin agonist ONO- 1301 enhances reversal of LV remodeling through biological mechanisms such as angiogenesis and attenuation of fibrosis. We therefore hypothesized that ONO- 1301 plus a cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> might be beneficial for the treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy. MethodsTwenty-four dogs with induced anterior wall infarction were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 groups at 1  week postinfarction as follows: cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> alone, cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> plus ONO- 1301 (hybrid therapy), ONO- 1301 alone, or sham control. ResultsAt 8 weeks post-infarction, LV wall stress was reduced significantly in the hybrid therapy group compared with the other groups. Myocardial blood flow, measured by positron emission tomography, and vascular density were significantly higher in the hybrid therapy group compared with the cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> alone and sham groups. The hybrid therapy group also showed the least interstitial fibrosis, the greatest recovery of LV systolic and diastolic functions, assessed by multidetector computed tomography and cardiac catheterization, and the lowest plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels (P < . 05). ConclusionsThe combination of a cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> and the prostacyclin agonist ONO- 1301 elicited a greater reversal of LV remodeling than either treatment alone, suggesting the potential of this hybrid therapy for the clinical treatment of ischemia-induced heart failure...|$|R
