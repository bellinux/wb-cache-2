40|$|With the {{promoted}} use of {{compact fluorescent}} lamps and the increasing amount of stockpiled compact fluorescent lamp waste, lamp phosphors are becoming an interesting secondary source for critical metals (yttrium, europium and terbium). This paper explores on the mechanism of a new potential hydrometallurgical route to improve the recovery efficiency of rare-earth elements from the green phosphor LaPO 4 :Ce 3 +,Tb 3 + using mechanical activation as a pretreatment step prior to leaching. By applying an intense frictional action, the leaching yields of rare-earth elements were enhanced from 0. 9 % to 81 % at room temperature, {{as a consequence of}} the change in activation energy. The shrinking core model was employed for modelling the leaching kinetics of the rare-earth elements and to calculate the decreasing apparent activation energy of the unmilled and milled samples (from 68 kJ mol− 1 to 1. 4 kJ mol− 1). This difference can be explained by the physicochemical changes, including structural decomposition, specific surface area increase and particle size reduction, which were related to the corresponding leaching pattern. The optimized mechanical activation procedure was successfully applied to lamp phosphor waste, containing a mix of different phosphors. After sequential removal of the <b>halophosphate</b> <b>phosphor</b> and the red YOX phosphor, 99. 0 %, 87. 3 % and 86. 3 % of La, Ce and Tb present in the LaPO 4 :Ce 3 +,Tb 3 + phosphor could be dissolved. These observations provide more insight in the mechanical activation process and may contribute to a more sustainable alternative route to the rare-earth element recycling industry. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Antimony is {{becoming}} an increasingly critical element as the supply-demand gap is expected to exceed 10 % over the period 2015 – 2020. Antimony production is primarily concentrated in China (90 %) and as the industrial demand for this metal surges, attention has to turn towards the recovery of antimony from (industrial) waste residues and end-of-life products in order to guarantee a sustainable supply of antimony. Although lamp phosphor waste is usually considered {{as a source of}} rare earths, it also contains significant amounts of antimony {{in the form of the}} white <b>halophosphate</b> <b>phosphor</b> (Ca,Sr) 5 (PO 4) 3 (Cl,F) :Sb 3 +,Mn 2 + (HALO). HALO phosphor readily dissolves in dilute acidic conditions, making antimony far more accessible than in the main production route which is the energy intensive processing of stibnite ore (Sb 2 S 3). HALO makes up 50 wt% of the lamp phosphor waste, but it has been systematically overlooked and treated as an undesired residue in the efforts to recover rare earths from lamp phosphor waste. In this paper, the feasibility of antimony recovery is discussed and an efficient process is proposed. The HALO phosphor is first dissolved in dilute HCl at room temperature, followed by a selective extraction of antimony with the ionic liquid Aliquat® 336. The remaining leachate is valorized as apatite which is a feed for the phosphate and fertilizer industry. A zero-waste valorization approach was followed, meaning that no residue or waste was accepted and that all the elements were converted into useful products. This paper thus emphasizes the potential of lamp phosphor waste as a secondary source of antimony and describes a sustainable process to recover it. The process can be integrated in lamp phosphor recycling schemes aimed at recovering rare earths. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the optical {{properties}} of Mn + 2 in commercial <b>halophosphate</b> <b>phosphors</b> has revealed that the Mn + 2 is located on four distinguishable sites: on the simple Ca(I) site, on the simple Ca(II) site, on a Ca(I I) site adjacent to an antimony-oxygen pair, and on a Ca(II) site adjacent o a chlorine ion in those phosphors containing chlorine. The Mn + 2 fluorescence that results when the excitation is via energy transfer from antimony ions is pr imari ly due to Mn + 2 situated on a Ca(I) site, with smaller components due to Mrl + 2 located on the other sites observed.

Conclusions There {{are a number}} of interesting facts which can be deduced from the data presented in the color mea-surements. First of all, the bluest phosphor is the pure fluorapatite. The addition of even a small amount of chloride serves to shift the color to a point much greener. Thus, it is essential to prevent any contamina-tion by chloride in order to produce the bluest phos-phor. It can also be noted that the color of the mixed apatites at zero manganese content is invariant at all F/C 1 ratios (see Fig. 4). (Note also that the min imum amount of chloride necessary to cause this shift has not been determined in this work). A second deduction indicates that the mixed apatites form a different set of loci than the pure fluoroapatite. Although the pure fluoroapatite is bluer than any of the mixed apatites, the addition of Mn + 2 to the fiuoro-apatite produces phosphors which are greener than any of the mixed phases. Table I.

40|$|The supply {{risk for}} certain rare-earth {{elements}} (REEs) has sparked {{the development of}} recycling schemes for end-of-life products like fluorescent lamps. In this paper a new recycling process for lamp phosphor waste is proposed based {{on the use of}} the functionalized ionic liquid betainium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide, [Hbet][Tf 2 N]. This innovative method allows the selective dissolution of the valuable red phosphor Y 2 O 3 :Eu 3 + (YOX) without leaching the other constituents of the waste powder (other phosphors, glass particles and alumina). A selective dissolution of YOX is useful because this phosphor contains 80 wt% of the REEs although it only represents 20 wt% of the lamp phosphor waste. The proposed recycling process is a major improvement compared to currently used hydrometallurgical processes where the non-valuable <b>halophosphate</b> (HALO) <b>phosphor</b> (Sr,Ca) 10 (PO 4) 6 (Cl,F) 2 :Sb 3 +,Mn 2 + is inevitably leached when attempting to dissolve YOX. Since the HALO phosphor can make up as much as 50 wt% of the lamp phosphor waste powder, this consumes significant amounts of acid and complicates the further processing steps (e. g. solvent extraction). The dissolved yttrium and europium can be recovered by a single stripping step using a stoichiometric amount of solid oxalic acid or by contacting the ionic liquid with a hydrochloric acid solution. Both approaches regenerate the ionic liquid, but precipitation stripping with oxalic acid has the additional advantage that there is no loss of ionic liquid to the water phase and that the yttrium/europium oxalate can be calcined as such to reform the red Y 2 O 3 :Eu 3 + phosphor (purity > 99. 9 wt%), effectively closing the loop after only three process steps. The red phosphor prepared from the recycled yttrium and europium showed excellent luminescent properties. The resulting recycling process for lamp phosphor waste consumes only oxalic acid and features a selective leaching, a fast stripping and an immediate revalorization step. Combined with the mild conditions, the reusability of the ionic liquid and the fact that no additional waste water is generated, this process is a very green and efficient alternative to traditional mineral acid leaching. status: publishe...|$|R
