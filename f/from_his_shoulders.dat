25|$|According to the Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra, the sun {{and moon}} {{are said to be}} born from Avalokiteśvara's eyes, Shiva from his brow, Brahma <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> Narayana from his heart, Sarasvati from his teeth, the winds from his mouth, the earth from his feet and the sky from his stomach. In this text and others, such as the Longer Sukhavativyuha Sutra, Avalokiteśvara is an {{attendant}} of Amitabha.|$|E
500|$|In Scandinavia too, in {{the nineteenth}} century, traditions of elves were adapted to include small, insect-winged fairies. These are often called [...] "elves" [...] (älvor in modern Swedish, alfer in Danish, álfar in Icelandic), {{although}} the more formal translation in Danish is feer. Thus, the alf found in the fairy tale The Elf of the Rose by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen is so tiny that he can have a rose blossom for home, and has [...] "wings that reached <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> to his feet". Yet Andersen also wrote about elvere in The Elfin Hill. The elves in this story are more alike those of traditional Danish folklore, who were beautiful females, living in hills and boulders, capable of dancing a man to death. Like the huldra in Norway and Sweden, they are hollow when seen from the back.|$|E
500|$|In {{the book}} Skáldskaparmál, Idunn is {{mentioned}} {{in its first}} chapter (numbered as 55) as one of eight ásynjur (goddesses) sitting in their thrones at a banquet in Asgard for Ægir. In chapter 56, Bragi tells Ægir about Iðunn's abduction by the jötunn Þjazi. Bragi says that after hitting an eagle (Þjazi in disguise) with a pole, Loki finds himself stuck to the bird. Loki is pulled further and further into the sky, his feet banging against stones, gravel, and trees. Loki feels that his arms might be pulled out <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Loki shouts and begs the eagle for a truce, and the eagle responds that Loki would not be free unless he made a solemn vow to have Iðunn come outside of Asgard with her apples. Loki accepts Þjazi's conditions and returns to his friends Odin and Hœnir. At the time Þjazi and Loki agreed on, Loki lures Iðunn out of Asgard into [...] "a certain forest", telling {{her that he had}} discovered some apples that she would find worth keeping, and told Iðunn that she ought to bring her own apples with her so that she may compare them with the apples he has discovered. Þjazi arrives in eagle shape, snatches Iðunn, flies away with her and takes her to his home, Þrymheimr.|$|E

2500|$|Thor arrives, {{and tells}} Loki to be silent, {{referring}} {{to him as}} an [...] "evil creature," [...] stating that with his hammer Mjöllnir he will silence Loki by hammering his head <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Acknowledging that Thor has arrived, Loki asks Thor why he is raging, and says that Thor won't be so bold {{to fight against the}} wolf when he swallows Odin at Ragnarök. Thor again tells Loki to be silent, and threatens him with Mjöllnir, adding that he will throw Loki [...] "up on the roads to the east," [...] and thereafter no one {{will be able to see}} Loki. Loki states that Thor should never brag of his journeys to the east, claiming that there Thor crouched cowering in the thumb of a glove, mockingly referring to him as a [...] "hero," [...] and adding that such behaviour was unlike Thor. Thor responds by telling Loki to be silent, threatening him with Mjöllnir, and adding that every one of Loki's bones will be broken with it. Loki says he intends to live for a long while yet despite Thor's threats, and taunts Thor about an encounter Thor once had with the Skrýmir (Útgarða-Loki in disguise). Thor again commands Loki to be silent, threatens Loki with Mjöllnir, and says he will send Loki to Hel, below the gates of Nágrind.|$|E
2500|$|Some of Cooke's {{family and}} supporters, however, have {{rejected}} Boyer's version of events, {{as well as}} those given by Franklin and Carr. They believe that there was a conspiracy to murder Cooke and that the murder took place in some manner entirely different from the three official accounts."'In the course of the two or three hundred different interviews with different people that I did for the book, there are two or three hundred different conspiracy theories,' he said. 'While they were all extremely interesting, and while every one of them reflected a basic truth about prejudice in America in 1964 and the truth of the prejudice that has continued into the present day, none of them came accompanied by any evidence beyond that metaphorical truth.'" [...] Singer Etta James viewed Cooke's body before his funeral and questioned the accuracy of the official version of events. She wrote that the injuries she observed were well beyond the official account of Cooke having fought Franklin alone. James wrote that Cooke was so badly beaten that his head was nearly separated <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> his hands were broken and crushed, and his nose mangled. Some people speculated that Cooke's manager, Allen Klein, might have had a role in his death. Klein owned Tracey, Ltd, which ultimately owned all rights to Cooke's recordings.|$|E
