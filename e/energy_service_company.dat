50|$|In early 2017, MMOPL {{completed}} {{the installation of}} light-emitting diode (LED) lighting at all metro stations, the depot, and administrative buildings to reduce electricity consumption. The MMOPL also began a project under the Renewable <b>Energy</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Company</b> (RESCO) model to install rooftop solar panels at all stations and the metro depot. Under the model, a private company will bear the cost of setting and operating the panels, and will sell the generated power to the MMOPL {{at a rate of}} 5.1 per unit. A total of 2.30 MWp will be generated by the system, of which about 2 MWp is generated by the station's rooftop solar panels and 0.30 MWp is generated by the depot's solar panels.

40|$|AbstractThe {{residential}} {{housing sector}} {{is a major}} consumer of energy accounting for approximately one third of carbon emissions in the United Kingdom. Achieving a sustainable, low-carbon infrastructure necessitates a reduced and more efficient use of domestic <b>energy</b> supplies. <b>Energy</b> <b>service</b> <b>companies</b> offer an alternative to traditional providers, which supply a single utility product to satisfy the unconstrained demand of end users, and {{have been identified as}} a potentially important actor in sustainable future economies. An agent-based model is developed to examine the potential of <b>energy</b> <b>service</b> <b>companies</b> to contribute to the large scale upgrading of household energy efficiency, which would ultimately lead to a more sustainable and secure energy infrastructure. The migration of households towards <b>energy</b> <b>service</b> <b>companies</b> is described by an attractiveness array, through which potential customers can evaluate the future benefits, in terms of household energy costs, of changing provider. It is shown that self-financing is a limiting factor to the widespread upgrading of residential energy efficiency. Greater reductions in household energy costs could be achieved by committing to longer term contracts, allowing upgrade costs to be distributed over greater time intervals. A steadily increasing cost of future energy usage lends an element of stability to the market, with <b>energy</b> <b>service</b> <b>companies</b> displaying the ability to retain customers on contract expiration. The model highlights how a greater focus on the provision of <b>energy</b> <b>services,</b> as opposed to consumable products, presents a viable approach to reducing future energy costs and usage...|$|R
