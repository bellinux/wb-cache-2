They were shallow-draught motor boats which towed small barges <b>under</b> the <b>girders</b> of the floating bridges carrying the wire needed to hold the floating bridge in position.|$|R
5000|$|In 1900, Pennsylvania {{replaced}} the river trusses with a steel <b>under</b> <b>girder,</b> open deck bridge of four spans. At that time, the abutment and pier masonry was augmented.

50|$|In 1896, the Pennsylvania Railroad {{acquired}} {{control of}} the F&PL. The original Bollman iron truss span over Little Pipe Creek of 135 feet (Span 9 in the USRA drawing) was replaced with a steel plate <b>under</b> <b>girder</b> span of shorter length (79 feet). The immediately adjacent trestles (north and south) were also replaced with 42 foot steel trestles, leaving {{the rest of the}} original Bollman built iron trestle approaches intact.|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{stability}} of the inclined cable with a fixed support {{at one end and}} time-varying support at the other end is studied to obtain local vibration of stay cables in cable stayed bridges in this paper. Relations between natural frequencies of local vibraions of stay cables and natural frequencies of clobal vertical and torsional vibrations of the cable-stayed bridge in Japan are shown at first. Then, unstable regions and amplitudes of stay cables <b>under</b> <b>girder</b> vibration are discussed. The nonlinear equation of motion that governs transverse vibrations of cable is solved by the harmonic balance method...|$|R

50|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad {{acquired}} {{control of}} the F&PL in 1896, and rebuilt the bridge that year as an open deck riveted iron plate <b>under</b> <b>girder</b> bridge and then again in 1902-1903 using steel in the bridge and trestling. In 1915, the bridge was surveyed {{as part of the}} Interstate Commerce Commission's effort to establish freight rates for the parent railroad. The United States Railroad Administration rebuilt the creek span circa 1917. Additional work rebuilding the bridge and trestling was performed in the 1982-1989 period by the Maryland State Railroad Administration. In 1991, the bridge was surveyed as part of the Maryland Historic Sites Inventory.|$|R
