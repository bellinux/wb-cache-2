25|$|A {{somewhat}} similar method {{had been previously}} used by John Landen in the Residual Analysis, published in London in 1758. Lagrange believed that he could thus <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> difficulties, connected {{with the use of}} infinitely large and infinitely small quantities, to which philosophers objected in the usual treatment of the differential calculus. The book is divided into three parts: of these, the first treats of the general theory of functions, and gives an algebraic proof of Taylor's theorem, the validity of which is, however, open to question; the second deals with applications to geometry; and the third with applications to mechanics.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{stated that}} the theme of Sivaji has been {{inspired}} from Shankar's previous films Gentleman (1993) and Mudhalvan (1999).

Gopinath Rajendran of The New Indian Express compared the film's title character to Robin Hood for being a hero [...] "who takes from the rich and passes it on to the poor".|$|E

I realized after making THX that those problems are so real that most of us have to face those things every day, so we're {{in a constant state of}} frustration.

Edward Nashton {{is described as a}} police consultant and apparent head of the GCPD's Cybercrime unit. Here, he has yet to take up the mantle of the Riddler and is known only as [...] "Enigma". In the game, he has set up a series of signal jammers throughout Gotham City to disrupt the Batplane as well as Batman's own hacking transmitter. He plots to blackmail several of Gotham's most prominent citizens, in the hopes of making Gotham a better place by <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who are corrupt, although in the process risking the lives of several innocent people. Enigma also has several informants and pieces of extortion recordings scattered throughout Gotham, which Batman must uncover and decode in place of the Riddler trophies of previous games. His encounter with Batman prompts Edward to go into hiding and develop his identity as The Riddler; he hints to this as he calls Batman [...] "quite the riddle." ...|$|R

Duvall also believed that Universal's lack of familiarity and comfort with southern culture and the country music genre further reduced their faith in the film. When country star Willie Nelson offered to help publicize it, a studio executive told Duvall she did not understand how the singer could contribute to the promotion, which Duvall said was indicative of the studio's failure to understand both the film and the country music genre.|$|R
