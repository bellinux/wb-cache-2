25|$|Snow Patrol {{supported}} U2 {{over two}} legs on {{a handful of}} shows on their European and North American legs of the 360° Tour. The second leg of shows from 12 September coincided with Snow Patrol's own headlining North American Tour. During the first leg of supporting shows, the band played a concert in Poland. Lightbody was overwhelmed by the show U2 put up, and broke down crying, only to find everyone <b>else</b> <b>around</b> him was doing the same. He later wrote a piece for U2's official website, describing his experience of the show, saying {{that it was one of}} the best nights of his life and the best reception they had gotten on the support shows.|$|E
25|$|The {{caves in}} the Rock of Gibraltar that the Neanderthals {{inhabited}} have been excavated and have revealed {{a wealth of}} information about their lifestyle and the prehistoric landscape of the area. The peninsula stood {{on the edge of a}} fertile coastal plain, now submerged, that supported a wide variety of animals and plants which the Neanderthals exploited to provide a highly varied diet. Unlike northern Europe, which underwent massive swings in its climate and was largely uninhabitable for long periods, the far south of Iberia enjoyed a stable and mild climate for over 125,000 years. It became a refuge from the ice ages for animals, plants and Neanderthals, who survived there for possibly several thousand years longer than anywhere <b>else.</b> <b>Around</b> 24,000 years ago, however, the climate underwent abrupt changes which would have greatly disrupted the Gibraltar Neanderthals' food supply and may have stressed their population beyond recovery, leading to their final extinction.|$|E
25|$|In 1909 Hornsby's {{showed the}} British Army their invention, who were bemused, but took the idea {{no further than}} that, {{although}} they subsequently bought four caterpillar tractors in 1910 to tow artillery. A short time later, Hornsbys sold the patent for the caterpillar track in 1914 to The Holt Manufacturing Company of California, USA for $8,000, having only sold one caterpillar tractor commercially. Hornsby's design was far ahead of anything <b>else</b> <b>around</b> at the time. Through ownership of the patent, this company became the successful Caterpillar Inc. Tractor Company. Benjamin Holt even {{claimed to be the}} real inventor. In December 1914 the British Army's Colonel Ernest Swinton saw one of Holt's caterpillar tractors towing a piece of artillery, and realised its potential as an attack vehicle. One year later the tank was born (using Hornsby's initial designs), being made in nearby Lincoln by William Foster. It first saw action at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette on 15 September 1916.|$|E

50|$|Pat is {{socially}} awkward, {{to the point}} of impairment. Pat speaks in a nasal voice which is much louder than everyone <b>else's</b> <b>around</b> Pat. Pat often end sentences by making a strange whimpering, giggling, or 'thought-in-process' sound. Pat apparently has very sweaty palms, and is constantly wiping them on clothing, as if to dry them. The other characters are generally sympathetic, and attempt to include Pat in conversations or activities. An exception to this is when Pat speaks of sexual and romantic interests, to which other characters react with disgust or, at least, disinterest.|$|R

25|$|The United States War Department under Edwin M. Stanton {{expected}} Butler to hold eastern Louisiana and {{the cities}} of Baton Rouge and New Orleans, maintain communications up river to Vicksburg, and support Farragut's forces for the siege of Vicksburg. In addition the city of New Orleans itself was just as indefensible for the Union as for the Confederates. Surrounded by a fragile network of levees and lower in elevation than anything <b>else</b> <b>around</b> it, New Orleans was extremely vulnerable to flooding, bombardment, and insurrection, and was generally unhealthy and subject to devastating epidemics. Defense of the city against attacks from Confederate forces depended on an extensive outer ring of fortifications requiring a garrison of thousands of troops. As a conquered territory, Louisiana had a potential for becoming a serious logistical drain on Union forces, and an unsustainable front if contested by well-organized resistance movements. It was popularly assumed that the Confederacy would launch a major counteroffensive to retake New Orleans. As the largest population center of the Confederacy, and commanding formidable industrial and shipping resources, its permanent loss would be politically intolerable to the Confederacy.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} [...] "B", however was less {{positive}} than other critics. While {{he stated that}} the musical numbers were [...] "among the best things the show has ever done", he felt that [...] "just about everything <b>else</b> <b>around</b> them gets short shrift", criticizing the increase in performances on {{the first half of}} the season for upsetting the balance of the series. Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 8/10, observing that while he was in the minority of reviewers for not [...] "absolutely loving it", he found [...] "The Power of Madonna" [...] to be [...] "a bit messy in the writing department, even while it delivered several really great scenes and moments along the way." ...|$|E
500|$|Depp {{created his}} own image of Todd. Heavy purple and brown make-up was applied around his eyes to suggest fatigue and rage, as if [...] "he's never slept". Burton said of the {{character}} Sweeney Todd, [...] "We always saw him as a sad character, not a tragic villain or anything. He's basically a dead person when you meet him; the only thing that's keeping him going is the one single minded thing which is tragic. You don't see anything <b>else</b> <b>around</b> him." [...] Depp said of the character, [...] "He makes Sid Vicious look like the innocent paper boy. He's beyond dark. He's already dead. He's been dead for years." [...] Depp also commented on the streak of white in Todd's hair, saying, [...] "The idea was that he'd had this hideous trauma, from being sent away, locked away. That streak of white hair became the shock of that rage. It represented his rage over what had happened. It's certainly {{not the first time}} anyone's used it. But it's effective. It tells a story all by itself. My brother had a white spot growing up, and his son has this kind of shock of white in his hair." ...|$|E

500|$|In May 2000, Howarth {{played for}} Premier League club Leeds United in a seven-a-side tournament in Singapore, because their own goalkeepers were unavailable. He also {{represented}} York in the Candia-66 International Under-20s Tournament {{for a second}} successive summer, although he only played one match as he was being rested after playing for Leeds. His first appearance of 2000–01 came 22 August 2000, in York's 5–1 defeat at home to Stoke City in the League Cup first round first leg. During the match, he fumbled a Graham Fenton cross, and Stoke opened the scoring from the error. He garnered praise from York's part-time goalkeeping coach and former Everton player Neville Southall, who Howarth held as a boyhood hero, saying: [...] "Russ can {{be as good as}} he wants to be. He works hard and has a great attitude when a lot of youngsters today at big clubs don't have such a good attitude. He will succeed. Even if it is in three, five or even ten years, he will succeed." [...] With Fettis rested, Howarth made his second appearance of the season on 9 January 2001, starting in a 4–0 defeat at home to Darlington in the Football League Trophy Northern Section first round. Despite conceding four goals, he was the only player to escape criticism from manager Terry Dolan, who said: [...] "He was let down by everyone <b>else</b> <b>around</b> him. He had no protection whatsoever. His kicking was excellent and he did everything else he had to do without a problem." [...] Due to the good form of Fettis, Howarth finished the season with only two appearances.|$|E

2500|$|Anderson {{soon became}} notorious for causing controversy, {{such as his}} infamous quote that resurfaced in {{interviews}} and articles in the following years, that he was [...] "a bisexual man who never had a homosexual experience". In February 1993, Suede went from highly touted indie band to major chart contenders with their third single, [...] "Animal Nitrate", which went into the UK top ten. The single earned them a last-minute invitation to play at that year's Brit Awards ceremony. Impressed by the band's charged sexuality, Suede's first sequence of singles and first album shocked audiences and critics alike. Suede's sexual lyrics made them a rallying point for the alienated, {{one of the few}} British bands since the Smiths who united as much as they divided. Comparisons were being made with David Bowie, though Suede sounded nothing quite like anybody <b>else</b> <b>around</b> at the time, and soon they fell upon what critics quickly deemed was a new movement. Anderson recalls, [...] "I had always been fascinated by suburbia, and I liked to throw these twisted references to small-town British life into songs. This was before we had that horrible term Britpop." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Tumble and Fall", {{the third}} track on Pushing the Senses, {{was chosen as}} its lead single, because their European label Play it Again Sam (PIAS), were getting more {{involved}} with the band, believing the song would be a crossover to make them successful in Europe after touring with Coldplay in 2003. The single became the band's most successful single release since [...] "Buck Rogers", reaching the top five in the UK. Grant claimed that [...] "Tumble and Fall" [...] is a love song, but can be interpreted in any way. In an interview with Feederweb, Grant said of the song: [...] "Again {{this is about the}} ups and downs of life. Its about life in general and how you deal with it. It covers the journey of life and how you have to take the ups with the downs. I wasn’t going to record this song. It took me a long time to finish it, to be happy with it, because the song went through various stages. I wasn’t sure if we really needed a tune like that on the album. But I decided to go to the studio to record an acoustic version just to see what happened and that’s how the song started. It was a completely one take vocal, live with the acoustic guitar and we built everything <b>else</b> <b>around</b> it. It is an acoustic track that grew into what it is now. So that was the only song that we recorded like that on the album, so it is a bit different for that reason and is probably why it has an organic feel to it".|$|E
2500|$|No Isis album {{contains}} an explicit , or story arc, instead focusing on themes rather than stories. As such, releases {{are defined by}} some as [...] "pseudo-concept albums". The band see lyrics as important, {{but at the same}} time, Turner does not feel it necessary to enunciate every word. Instead, any connections made are mainly conjecture, and the formation of a theme takes into account the album artwork, previous albums, track titles and the use of metaphor just as much as lyricism. Oceanic tells a convoluted tale involving love, incest and suicide by drowning. This relates to the theme of the all-powerful female, present lyrically in every album except Panopticon. Turner does not explicitly acknowledge an [...] "overtly feminine theme"; however, he does state: [...] "I just think it's interesting to include that as part of what we do, simply because metal, especially, is considered to be this very male-oriented, testosterone-driven art form, and I feel like it's important to recognize the other side of our nature. As manly as we might or might not be, we have to acknowledge that there is a feminine part of our persona, and that the world isn't made up of absolutes. To achieve balance, you have to recognize every facet of yourself and everyone <b>else</b> <b>around</b> you." [...] Certain threads do reappear between albums, notes Turner. [...] "There are certain themes which reoccur in my work just because of what I'm interested in and what is aesthetically pleasing for me", he says. [...] "The idea of futuristic utopias and dystopias is probably something that does consciously and subconsciously return time and time again [...] and sometimes I just can't help the fact that these themes creep into my work whether it's conscious or not". The other two ongoing motifs in the lyrics and artwork are that of towers and mosquitos.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the series would feel as [...] "adult" [...] as Jessica Jones, Colter replied, [...] "if you think Jessica is adult then we’re still keeping up with that pace ... we’ll {{continue}} along those lines of PG-16+". On whether Luke Cage would address current race issues, including Black Lives Matter, given the character's past (a wrongfully imprisoned black man), Colter said, [...] "this {{is not necessarily the}} platform to hit it head on" [...] but [...] "the things that he's going through will ring true {{for a lot of people}} in law enforcement" [...] and on the street. Loeb said on the issue, [...] "Luke Cage, when he came on the scene in the early 70s was for all intents and purposes the first black superhero. Given what’s going on present day, it just resonates." [...] Coker stated that Cage is [...] "someone that the community can touch and go to", adding, [...] "There’s never been a time in history where having a bulletproof black man" [...] has been so important. Luke Cage was also the first MCU property to use the word [...] "nigger" [...] or [...] "nigga", with Marvel having complete trust in Coker's use of it: the word is used casually in the series, though some characters, including Cage, prefer not to use it. Coker said the intent was never to use it [...] "in a way where it's flippant. I used it from the standpoint of, if we were going to eavesdrop on a conversation with African American people, with nobody <b>else</b> <b>around,</b> when would this word be used and how would it get used." [...] Coker also likened the use in the series to [...] "the way music used to treat it," [...] not having it be [...] "every other word of every other chorus, because at that point, it just gets silly." ...|$|E
