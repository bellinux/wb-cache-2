5|$|Six {{million people}} were {{unemployed}} when the Nazis took power in 1933 and by 1937 there were fewer than a million. This was {{in part due to}} the removal of women from the workforce. Real wages dropped by 25 percent between 1933 and 1938. Trade unions were abolished in May 1933 with the seizure of the funds and arrest of the leadership of the Social Democratic trade unions. A new organisation, the German Labour Front, was created and placed under NSDAP functionary Robert Ley. The average German worked 43 <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> week in 1933 and by 1939 this increased to 47 <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> week.|$|E

5|$|Wild equines {{may spend}} seven <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day sleeping. During the day, they sleep {{standing}} up while at night they lie down. They regularly rub against trees, rocks {{and other objects}} and roll in around in dust for protection against flies and irritation. Except the mountain zebra, wild equines can roll over completely.|$|E
5|$|A barrier jet in the {{low levels}} forms just {{upstream}} of mountain chains, with the mountains forcing the jet to be oriented parallel to the mountains. The mountain barrier increases {{the strength of the}} low level wind by 45 percent. In the North American Great Plains a southerly low-level jet helps fuel overnight thunderstorm activity during the warm season, normally in the form of mesoscale convective systems which form during the overnight <b>hours.</b> <b>A</b> similar phenomenon develops across Australia, which pulls moisture poleward from the Coral Sea towards cut-off lows which form mainly across southwestern portions of the continent.|$|E
5|$|A {{light rail}} {{station in the}} Mount Baker area was first {{proposed}} in 1995 and approved the following year. Construction began in late 2005 and the station was opened for regular service on July 18, 2009. Trains serve the station 20 <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. Mount Baker station is also served by five King County Metro bus routes that connect it to Downtown, Capitol Hill, Rainier Beach, the Central District, and the University District.|$|E
25|$|This gives {{a service}} of 18 trains per <b>hour</b> (<b>a</b> train every 3-4 minutes) between Earl's Court and Tower Hill. Together with the Circle line, there are 24 trains per <b>hour</b> (<b>a</b> train every 2.5 minutes) between Gloucester Road and Tower Hill. 208million {{passenger}} journeys {{were made on}} the District line in 2011/12.|$|R

5|$|A {{particular}} critical {{success was}} The Year of the Sex Olympics, broadcast {{as part of}} BBC2's Theatre 625 series in July 1968. Kneale's first television work {{to be made in}} colour—although only a black-and-white copy now survives—the story was based in a future where {{the majority of the population}} are kept in a docile state by constant broadcasts of pornography and other low-brow reality television programming. The Live Life Show, in which a family are watched twenty-four <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day as they struggle to live on an isolated rural island, becomes a massive success, especially when a murderer is introduced into the set-up.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Earth, Van den Berg {{continued to work}} on crystal growth experiments at EG in California and he became the head for the section of materials science. At a later time he moved to Florida to become a chief scientist at the Constellation Technology Corporation. At age 72, he continued to work up to 40 <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> week and grow crystals, a process he compares to gardening. The crystals he grows (Mercuric Iodide crystals) are used to make precision detectors for nuclear radiation. These detectors are used in medical applications, by the defense industry and the International Atomic Energy Agency.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the team}} of writers were Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, who had created the Channel 4 sitcom Peep Show with O'Connor earlier that year, plus Rob Gibbons and Neil Gibbons. Filming of Bedsitcom began in May 2003 and lasted for {{approximately}} eight weeks. The flatmates were filmed for 12 <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day, with this footage then being edited down to roughly 25 minutes per week of filming.|$|E

The train itself began to flood, and approximately 1,400 passengers had to be rescued by boat.|$|E
5|$|Astatine is a {{radioactive}} {{chemical element}} with symbol At and atomic number 85. It is the rarest naturally occurring {{element in the}} Earth's crust, occurring only as the decay product of various heavier elements. All of astatine's isotopes are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.1 <b>hours.</b> <b>A</b> sample of the pure element has never been assembled, because any macroscopic specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity.|$|E
5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple {{digestive}} system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must {{spend much of their}} time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day feeding.|$|E
