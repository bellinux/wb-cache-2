5|$|Severe {{landslides}} {{and floods}} {{are projected to}} become <b>increasingly</b> <b>common</b> in such states as Assam. Ecological disasters, such as a 1998 coral bleaching event that killed off more than 70% of corals in the reef ecosystems off Lakshadweep and the Andamans and was brought on by elevated ocean temperatures tied to global warming, are also projected to become <b>increasingly</b> <b>common.</b> Meghalaya and other northeastern states are also concerned that rising sea levels will submerge much of Bangladesh and spawn a refugee crisis. If severe climate changes occurs, Bangladesh and parts of India that border it may lose vast tracts of coastal land.|$|E
5|$|In the US in the 1960s, {{military}} clothing became <b>increasingly</b> <b>common</b> (mostly {{olive drab}} rather than patterned camouflage); {{it was often}} found worn by anti-war protestors, initially within groups such as Vietnam Veterans Against the War but then increasingly widely {{as a symbol of}} political protest.|$|E
5|$|Most of the German {{universities}} are public institutions, and students traditionally study without fee payment. The general requirement for university is the Abitur. However, {{there are a}} number of exceptions, depending on the state, the college and the subject. Tuition free academic education is open to international students and is <b>increasingly</b> <b>common.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{recurrent}} oral candidiasis, {{the use of}} azole antifungals risks {{selection and}} enrichment of drug-resistant strains of candida organisms. Drug resistance is <b>increasingly</b> more <b>common</b> and presents a serious problem in persons who are immunocompromised.|$|R
25|$|Most commonly, {{drugs are}} organic small {{molecules}} produced through chemical synthesis, but biopolymer-based drugs (also known as biopharmaceuticals) produced through biological processes are becoming <b>increasingly</b> more <b>common.</b> In addition, mRNA-based gene silencing technologies may have therapeutic applications.|$|R
5|$|Single-parent {{homes in}} America are <b>increasingly</b> <b>common.</b> With more {{children}} being born to unmarried couples and to couples whose marriages subsequently dissolve, more children live {{with just one}} parent. The proportion of children living with a never-married parent has grown, from 4% in 1960 to 42% in 2001. Of all single-parent families, 83% are mother–child families.|$|E
5|$|While devotional {{paintings}} – especially altarpieces – remained {{dominant in}} Early Netherlandish art, secular portraiture became <b>increasingly</b> <b>common</b> in both {{northern and southern}} Europe as artists freed themselves from the prevailing idea that portraiture should be restricted to saints and other religious figures. In Italy this development was tied to the ideals of humanism.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} {{seedlings}} grown from seed collected in 28 areas showed a north-south change in leaf shape and dimensions. Seedling leaves get longer and narrower southwards. Seedlings often have leaves with red-brown pigmentation which disappears in older plants, and this coloration becomes <b>increasingly</b> <b>common</b> towards the south. The changes in shape—leaves getting narrower and more robust {{from north to}} south and from lowland to montane—suggest adaptations to colder weather.|$|E
50|$|Orchids are {{becoming}} <b>increasingly</b> more <b>common</b> as restoration {{work has been}} going on putting orchids back in their natural habitat. Purple pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea), while once common, has been poached from the area and no longer occurs.|$|R

50|$|School {{corporal}} punishment - of students by teachers or school administrators - has been banned in many countries, including Canada, Kenya, South Africa, New Zealand {{and nearly all}} of Europe. It remains legal, if <b>increasingly</b> less <b>common,</b> in the United States.|$|R
5|$|An <b>increasingly</b> <b>common</b> {{strategy}} to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a dental implant into a recent extraction site. On the one hand, it shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because the soft tissue envelope is preserved. On the other hand, implants may have a slightly higher rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1473 in Cracow (Kraków), the {{printing}} business kept growing. By {{the turn of}} the 16th/17th century there were about 20 printing houses within the Commonwealth, 8 in Cracow, the rest mostly in Danzig (Gdańsk), Thorn (Toruń) and Zamość. The Academy of Kraków and Sigismund II possessed well-stocked libraries; smaller collections were <b>increasingly</b> <b>common</b> at noble courts, schools and townspeople's households. Illiteracy levels were falling, as {{by the end of the}} 16th century almost every parish ran a school.|$|E
5|$|Different {{national}} {{styles of}} organ building began to develop, often due to changing political climates. In the Netherlands, the organ became a large instrument with several divisions, doubled ranks, and mounted cornets. The organs of northern Germany also had more divisions, and independent pedal divisions became <b>increasingly</b> <b>common.</b> The {{divisions of the}} organ became visibly discernible from the case design. 20th-century musicologists labelled this the Werkprinzip.|$|E
50|$|Civil {{confirmation}} {{declined in}} the 1970s as central organized ceremonies, but instead they became <b>increasingly</b> more <b>common</b> as private celebrations and the civil confirmations are still common today in atheist families. They are also known as 'nonfirmations', but are now rarely linked to any associations.|$|R
50|$|Currently, {{the more}} generic jury {{consulting}} or jury research is <b>increasingly</b> more <b>common</b> as attorneys trying high-stakes cases demand assistance through {{all parts of}} the trial process. The still more generic field of trial consulting also contains a myriad of other tools and techniques not directly related to juries.|$|R
50|$|Krzysztof Nowak of Interia.pl {{gave the}} album 8 out of 10 stars praising Abradab's {{production}} style and he emphasized its inspiration of New York sound.

5|$|E85 flex-fuel {{vehicles}} are becoming <b>increasingly</b> <b>common</b> in the Midwest, where corn {{is a major}} crop and is the primary feedstock for ethanol fuel production. Regional retail E85 prices vary widely across the US, with more favorable prices in the Midwest region, where most corn is grown and ethanol produced. Depending of the vehicle capabilities, the break-even price of E85 has to be between 25 and 30% lower than gasoline.|$|E
5|$|Larsen's {{exploration}} of race was informed {{by her own}} mixed racial heritage and the <b>increasingly</b> <b>common</b> practice of racial passing in the 1920s. Praised upon publication, the novel has since been celebrated in modern scholarship for its complex depiction of race, gender and sexuality, and {{is the subject of}} considerable scholarly criticism. As one of only two novels that Larsen wrote, Passing has been significant in placing its author at the forefront of several literary canons.|$|E
5|$|Out {{of various}} provinces of today's Poland, Christianity's spread was slowest in Pomerania, where it gained a {{significant}} following only around the 12th century. Initially, the clergy {{came from the}} Western Christian European countries; native Polish clergy took three or four generations to emerge, and were supported by the monasteries and friars that grew <b>increasingly</b> <b>common</b> in the 12th century. By the 13th century Roman Catholicism had become the dominant religion throughout Poland.|$|E
30|$|In summary, we {{experienced}} three cases of a retrosternal hernia as a rare complication after MIE. Surgeons {{should be aware}} of this uncommon complication if retrosternal route reconstruction is used after MIE. As MIE is performed more frequently in the near future, retrosternal hernia may become an <b>increasingly</b> more <b>common</b> complication.|$|R
50|$|C.B. {{channels}} {{still remained}} busy in many areas, despite mobile phones becoming <b>increasingly</b> more <b>common</b> and feature rich.

5|$|Recent work in {{developmental}} biology has identified dynamical and physical mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis that may underlie abrupt morphological transitions during evolution. Consequently, consideration of mechanisms of phylogenetic change {{that have been}} found in reality to be non-gradual is <b>increasingly</b> <b>common</b> in the field of evolutionary developmental biology, particularly in studies of the origin of morphological novelty. A description of such mechanisms {{can be found in the}} multi-authored volume Origination of Organismal Form (MIT Press; 2003).|$|E
5|$|Astronomical data {{taken with}} CCDs must undergo several {{calibration}} steps {{before they are}} suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is <b>increasingly</b> <b>common</b> at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025. Commercial and {{residential}} buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy {{features such as}} solar panels are becoming <b>increasingly</b> <b>common</b> in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. District heating will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste incineration and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20–30% of cars will run on electricity or biofuel by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.|$|E

50|$|A {{voting machine}} is a machine used to {{register}} and tabulate votes. The first voting machines were mechanical {{but it is}} <b>increasingly</b> more <b>common</b> to use electronic voting machines. Traditionally, a voting machine has been defined by the mechanism the system uses to cast votes and further categorized by the location where the system tabulates the votes.|$|R
5|$|Development for {{multiple}} platforms is profitable, but difficult. Optimizations needed for one platform architecture {{do not necessarily}} translate to others. Individual platforms such as the Sega Genesis and PlayStation 3 are seen as difficult to develop for compared to their competitors, and developers are not yet fully accustomed to new technologies such as multi-core processors and hyper-threading. Multi-platform releases are <b>increasingly</b> <b>common,</b> but not all differences between editions on multiple platforms can be fully explained by hardware alone, and there remain franchise stalwarts that exist solely on one system. Developers for new platforms such as handheld and mobile systems {{do not have to}} operate under the pressure of $20 million budgets and the scrutiny of publishers' marketing experts.|$|E
5|$|Floods are {{the most}} common natural {{disaster}} in India. The heavy southwest monsoon rains cause the Brahmaputra and other rivers to distend their banks, often flooding surrounding areas. Though they provide rice paddy farmers with a largely dependable source of natural irrigation and fertilisation, the floods can kill thousands and displace millions. Excess, erratic, or untimely monsoon rainfall may also wash away or otherwise ruin crops. Almost all of India is flood-prone, and extreme precipitation events, such as flash floods and torrential rains, have become <b>increasingly</b> <b>common</b> in central India over the past several decades, coinciding with rising temperatures. Mean annual precipitation totals have remained steady due to the declining frequency of weather systems that generate moderate amounts of rain.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the FCC {{modified}} its media ownership {{rules to}} count LMAs formed after November 5, 1996 that cover more than 15% {{of the broadcast}} day toward the ownership limits for the brokering station's owner. Even still, the related joint sales and shared services agreement structures became <b>increasingly</b> <b>common</b> during the 2000s; these outsourcing agreements proliferated between 2011 and 2013, when station owners such as Sinclair and the Nexstar Broadcasting Group began expanding their portfolios by acquiring additional stations {{in an effort to}} drive scale as well as to gain leverage in retransmission consent negotiations with cable and satellite television providers.|$|E
50|$|Epsychology {{is a form}} of {{psychological}} intervention delivered via information and communication technology. epsychology interventions have most commonly been applied in areas of health; examples are depression, adherence to medication, and smoking cessation.
