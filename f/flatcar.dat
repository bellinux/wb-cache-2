5|$|A celebration {{broke out}} among the miners, who broke into liquor {{warehouses}} and saloons. That night, some of the miners loaded a <b>flatcar</b> with dynamite and attempted to roll it toward the deputies' camp. It overturned short of its goal and killed a cow. Other miners wanted to blow up every mine in the region, but Johnson quickly discouraged them. Frustrated, several drunken miners then stole a work train and steamed into Victor. They {{caught up with the}} group of fleeing deputies, and a gun battle broke out. One deputy and one miner died, a man on each side was wounded, and six strikers were captured by the deputies. The miners subsequently captured three officials of the Strong mine who had been present when the shafthouse was blown up. A formal prisoner exchange later freed all prisoners on both sides.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, most railroads {{took the}} cue from circuses and started loading their own flatcars in this manner. But, loading even {{up to six}} {{automobiles}} onto one flat car left {{a large amount of}} space above the vehicles that was unused. The natural solution was to take the temporary assemblies that were used to stack and load vehicles within boxcars and permanently attach them to the flatcars. The assemblies, also called racks, created two levels on which automobiles could be loaded. To complete the <b>flatcar,</b> foldaway bridges were added {{to the ends of the}} <b>flatcar</b> decks to allow the vehicles to be driven the entire length of a train for loading. Such flatcars eliminated the need for specialized equipment to load and unload boxcar racks. All they needed now was a ramp at the right height.|$|E
50|$|Idler <b>flatcars</b> {{are also}} used in {{oversize}} freight service, as loads such as pipe often overhang the ends of most standard-sized <b>flatcars.</b> Empty <b>flatcars</b> will be placed {{on both ends of}} the loaded car. This protects the cargo ends from damage and ensures that the loaded cars don't bind, and damage the ends of adjacent cars.|$|R
50|$|TTX's railcar fleet {{consists}} of three key car types: <b>flatcars,</b> boxcars and gondolas. Half of the fleet is dedicated to <b>flatcars</b> and intermodal wells, with a quarter dedicated to auto racks for hauling finished vehicles. The remaining quarter of the pool includes boxcars, gondolas and specialized <b>flatcars</b> to carry {{a wide variety of}} general merchandise commodities. TTX provides standardized car types and re-purposes idle assets to serve a dynamic marketplace.|$|R

25|$|After a {{few more}} hours, the strikers {{attempted}} to burn the barges. They seized a raft, loaded it with oil-soaked timber and floated it toward the barges. The Pinkertons nearly panicked, and a Pinkerton captain had to threaten to shoot anyone who fled. But the fire burned itself out before it reached the barges. The strikers then loaded a railroad <b>flatcar</b> with drums of oil and set it afire. The <b>flatcar</b> hurtled down the rails toward the mill's wharf where the barges were docked. But the car stopped at the water's edge and burned itself out. Dynamite was thrown at the barges, but it only hit the mark once (causing a little damage to one barge). At 2:00p.m., the workers poured oil onto the river, hoping the oil slick would burn the barges; attempts to light the slick failed.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1950s, in Germany, Volkswagen Beetle {{production}} was increasing beyond {{the capacity of}} highway trucks (autocarriers). Volkswagen engineers worked with German railroads to design a railroad car that was basically an extra long version of a vehicle hauling trailer. The design {{they came up with}} was able to carry 10 vehicles on one car. VW's two-level <b>flatcar</b> design effectively became the first autorack, entering service circa 1954.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1954 Evans Products, a {{manufacturer}} of loading racks for carrying automobiles in conventional boxcars, developed a bi-level Auto-Loader superstructure with an elevating top deck capable of carrying six cars or light trucks on a typical <b>flatcar.</b> Two prototype units were constructed and mounted on conventional 53ft flat cars for field testing. NYC 500085 carried a semi-streamlined rack, while UP 5800 had a more utilitarian rack mounted. Neither design went into commercial production.|$|E
50|$|At a break-of-gauge, cargo is {{transloaded}} from boxcars or covered {{goods wagons}} on one track to wagons on another track {{of a different}} rail gauge, or else containers are transloaded from <b>flatcars</b> on one track to <b>flatcars</b> on another track of a different gauge. Variable-gauge axles can eliminate this inconvenience.|$|R

25|$|A huge bust of Kong's head, neck, {{and upper}} chest {{was made of}} wood, cloth, rubber, and bearskin by Delgado, E. B. Gibson, and Fred Reefe. Inside the structure, metal levers, hinges, and an air {{compressor}} were operated by three men to control the mouth and facial expressions. Its fangs were 10 inches in length and its eyeballs 12 inches in diameter. The bust was moved from set to set on a <b>flatcar.</b> Its scale matched none of the models and, if fully realized, Kong would have stood thirty to forty feet tall.|$|E
25|$|According to Centennial History of South Carolina Railroad, this wrote a {{new rule}} in the SCC {{operating}} manual that engineers were to remain on station at all times, {{with the aid of}} newly hired conductors to manage cars, passengers and switches. Salvageable parts from the Best Friend were later used to build the Phoenix which seems to have run up to the time of the American Civil War. To restore passenger confidence, a <b>flatcar</b> piled high with protective cotton bales was placed between the locomotive and its passenger cars.|$|E
25|$|As Virgil's {{train was}} {{pulling out of}} Tucson {{on its way to}} California, gunfire was heard. Witnesses gave {{contradictory}} accounts about the number of men seen near the tracks and numbers of shots fired. Some said the Earps were armed after leaving Porter's Hotel and others said they were not. Witnesses saw men running with weapons but could not identify anyone in the dark. Wyatt said later that he and his deputies spotted Frank Stilwell and another man he believed to be Ike Clanton armed with shotguns lying on a <b>flatcar.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{rest of the}} CPRR's {{rolling stock}} {{consisted}} of six cast-metal, wood-grain-patterned gondolas made by the studio's machine shop; and two boxcars, two stock cars, a <b>flatcar,</b> and a caboose made of wood from the studio's prop shop. Disney's fascination with miniature models was apparent {{with the level of}} detail he applied to the miniature interior of the caboose, which included a calendar hung on the wall, a broom, and a working potbelly stove. Except for its frame and trucks, Disney built the entire caboose himself. All of the train cars except for the caboose, when not in use, were stored in the CPRR's tunnel.|$|E
25|$|The {{town was}} first known as Crystal Ville. It {{was changed to}} Crystal Lake {{sometime}} before 1840. The area known today as downtown Crystal Lake was first called Dearborn and later, Nunda, from an area in New York where many settlers originated. The village of Dearborn was founded in the 1850s after an extension of railroads through the area. The first train station was built in 1856, although it was pre-fabricated and shipped from Chicago on a <b>flatcar.</b> At that time, the main business district for the village of Crystal Lake was located on Virginia Street, about one mile (1.6km) southwest of the railroad station. The railroad served to connect both the people and industries of Crystal Lake and Dearborn to Chicago {{and the rest of}} the country. Dearborn grew quickly due to this new rail connection.|$|E

After Agnes orders Armin to return home, Homer persuades Mayor Quimby and all the other {{citizens}} to allow Armin to resume his assumed identity as Principal Skinner. The real Skinner is unhappy about this, and refuses to give up his job and his dignity just because the people of Springfield prefer Armin to him. In response, the townspeople banish the real Skinner from town by tying him to a chair on a <b>flatcar</b> of a freight train. Judge Snyder declares that Armin will again be referred to as Seymour Skinner, that he will return to his job as school principal, and that no one shall mention the name [...] "Armin Tamzarian" [...] again.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{also common}} in North America to {{transport}} semi-trailers on railway flatcars or spine cars, an arrangement called [...] "piggyback" [...] or TOFC (trailer on <b>flatcar)</b> to {{distinguish it from}} container on <b>flatcar</b> (COFC). Some flatcars are designed with collapsible trailer hitches {{so they can be}} used for trailer or container service. Such designs allow trailers to be rolled on from one end, though lifting trailers on and off flatcars by specialized loaders is more common. TOFC terminals typically have large areas for storing trailers pending loading or pickup.|$|E
2500|$|Track ballast was put {{between the}} ties as they progressed. Where a proper railbed {{had already been}} prepared, the work progressed rapidly. Constantly needed {{supplies}} included [...] "food, water, ties, rails, spikes, fishplates, nuts and bolts, track ballast, telegraph poles, wire, fire wood (or coal on the UP) and water for the steam train locomotives, etc." [...] After a <b>flatcar</b> was unloaded, it would usually be hooked to a small locomotive and pulled back to a siding, so another <b>flatcar</b> with rails etc. could be advanced to the railhead. Since juggling railroad cars took time on flat ground, where wagon transport was easier, the rail cars would {{be brought to the}} end of the line by steam locomotive, unloaded, and the flat car returned immediately to a siding for another loaded car of either ballast or rails. Temporary sidings were often installed where it could be easily done to expedite getting needed supplies to the railhead.|$|E
50|$|When {{the circus}} {{switched}} to travel by train they began by using <b>flatcars</b> from the Pennsylvania Railroad, {{which turned out}} to be hazardous because the Pennsylvania Railroad's cars were in poor shape. In mid-season it was decided that they would buy their own cars, and when the P.T. Barnum Circus left Columbus, Ohio, it traveled on the first circus-owned train. It was made up of sixty cars, including forty-five <b>flatcars</b> carrying about 100 wagons.|$|R

2500|$|Gibson {{performed}} in The Hazards of Helen for 69 episodes until the series ended in February 1917, after which Kalem tried producing another serial The Daughter of Daring, with {{a starring role}} for her. [...] One of her best stunts appeared in this serial: traveling at full speed on a motorcycle chasing after a runaway freight train, Gibson rode through a wooden gate, shattering it completely, up a station platform, and through the open doors of a boxcar on a siding, with her machine traveling through the air until it landed on a <b>flatcar</b> in a passing train. The trick was to undercrank the camera and execute it all with flawless timing.|$|E
25|$|When {{carried by}} rail, {{containers}} can be loaded on <b>flatcars</b> or in container well cars. In Europe, stricter railway height restrictions (smaller loading gauge and structure gauge) and overhead electrification prevent containers from being stacked two high, and containers are hauled one high either on standard <b>flatcars</b> or other railroad cars.
