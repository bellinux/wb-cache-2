One {{of the factors}} affecting disease is psychological factors such as defense mechanisms, resiliency, and <b>general</b> <b>health.</b> This study assessed the relationship between <b>general</b> <b>health,</b> resiliency, and <b>general</b> defense mechanisms, and also predicts the <b>general</b> <b>health</b> of people with migraine headaches that have a high resiliency and use mature defense mechanisms. Material and Methods: 50 women with migraine headache {{in the city of}} Bushehr using defense mechanisms, resiliency, and <b>general</b> <b>health</b> questionnaires were studied. For statistical analysis, Pearson correlation and multiple regression tests were used by SPSS 17 software. Results: The results showed that most of the defense mechanisms of migraine sufferers are Immature and Neuroticism. There is significant negative correlation between the deterioration of <b>general</b> <b>health</b> and resiliency as well as the mature defense mechanism (p= 0 / 003), and also there is a significant positive correlation between this deterioration with neuroticism (p= 0 / 040) and immature defense mechanisms (p= 0 / 041). On the other hand there is significant negative correlation between resiliencies with immature (p= 0 / 009) and neuroticism defense mechanisms (p= 0 / 04), and also with mature defense mechanism has a significant positive correlation (p= 0 / 003). Also, as more people use the mature defense mechanism, their deterioration of <b>general</b> <b>health</b> will be reduced, but this relationship will be stronger with the presence of resiliency. So migraine people use the mature defense mechanisms with high resiliency will have more favorable <b>general</b> <b>health</b> (less deterioration of <b>general</b> <b>health).</b> Conclusion: This study showed that migraine patients use the mature defense mechanisms with high resiliency will have more favorable <b>general</b> <b>health</b> (less deterioration of <b>general</b> <b>health)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Cataract surgery {{improves}} {{vision and}} visual functioning; {{the effect on}} <b>general</b> <b>health</b> is not established. We investigated if vision, visual functioning, and <b>general</b> <b>health</b> follow the same trajectory of change the year after cataract surgery and if changes in vision explain changes in visual disability and <b>general</b> <b>health.</b> METHODS: One-hundred forty-eight persons, with a mean (SD) age of 78. 9 (5. 0) years (70 % bilateral surgery), were assessed before and 6 weeks and 12 months after surgery. Visual disability and <b>general</b> <b>health</b> were assessed by the CatQuest- 9 SF and the Short Formular- 36. RESULTS: Corrected binocular visual acuity, visual field, stereo acuity, and contrast vision improved (P < 0. 001) from before to 6 weeks after surgery, with further improvements of visual acuity evident up to 12 months (P = 0. 034). Cataract surgery {{had an effect on}} visual disability 1 year later (P < 0. 001). Physical and mental health improved after surgery (P < 0. 01) but had returned to presurgery level after 12 months. Vision changes did not explain visual disability and <b>general</b> <b>health</b> 6 weeks after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Vision improved and visual disability decreased in the year after surgery, whereas changes in <b>general</b> <b>health</b> and visual functioning were short-term effects. Lack of associations between changes in vision and self-reported disability and <b>general</b> <b>health</b> suggests that the degree of vision changes and self-reported health do not have a linear relationship...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundOur paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between family income and child health in France. We first examine {{whether there is a}} significant correlation between family income and child <b>general</b> <b>health,</b> and the evolution of this relationship across childhood years. We then study the role of specific health problems, access to health care, and supplemental health insurance coverage, in the income gradient in <b>general</b> <b>health.</b> We also quantify the role of income in child anthropometric measurements. Whenever possible, we compare our results for France with those obtained for other developed countries. MethodsUsing data on up to approximately 24, 000 French children from the Health, Health Care and Insurance Surveys, we apply econometric techniques to quantify the correlation between household income, child <b>general</b> <b>health,</b> specific health problems, anthropometric characteristics, access to health care, and supplemental insurance coverage. ResultsThere is a positive and significant correlation between family income and child <b>general</b> <b>health</b> in France. The income gradient in child <b>general</b> <b>health</b> is possibly smaller in France than in other developed countries. The gradient in <b>general</b> <b>health</b> is explained by the greater prevalence of specific health problems for low-income children. In addition, income is strongly correlated with anthropometric characteristics. Access to health care, and supplemental health insurance coverage are probably not major determinants of the gradient in <b>general</b> <b>health.</b> ConclusionThe relationship between income and health in adulthood has antecedents in childhood. Improving access to health care services for children from low-income families {{may not be enough to}} decrease social health inequalities in childhood...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Sleep quality affects on {{physical}} and psychological well being and even academic functions of students. Indeed, sleep quality has been suggested as an individual index of <b>general</b> <b>health.</b> Among adolescents and young adults, poor sleep quality is common. The aim of this survey {{was to determine the}} sleep quality and its correlation with <b>general</b> <b>health</b> in 18 -year-old Iranian students. Methods: Simple random sampling was used to select 1000 students from all of the Karaj non-private pre-university schools for this cross sectional study. These students were asked to complete two self-report questionnaires; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and <b>General</b> <b>Health</b> Questionnaire- 28. Nine hundred and forty three students were entered into the final analysis. Results: Poor sleep quality and poor <b>general</b> <b>health</b> were observed in 56 % and 42 % of participants, respectively. In both of them the difference between boys and girls was significant (P< 0. 05). Poor <b>general</b> <b>health</b> was noticed in 55 % of students with poor sleep quality. Also, there were a positive correlation between sleep quality and <b>general</b> <b>health.</b> Conclusion: The prevalence of poor sleep quality in Iranian pre-university students is higher than that of many other countries. Further researches are required for finding the etiology...|$|R
40|$|Background: Sleeping {{disturbances}} {{considered as}} a remarkable health problem among shift workers, which may lead to physical and mental disorders. This study aimed to examine the sleeping quality and its relationships with the <b>general</b> <b>health</b> among shift workers in a metal press workshop. Methods: Descriptive study was conducted and assists 196 subjects of shift workers who were working in press workshop in a car industry. <b>General</b> <b>Health</b> Questionnaire (GHQ- 28) and Pittsburg sleep quality Index (PSQI) was used. In addition, some information was collected through interview {{in the workplace and}} was analyzed by Fisher and Chi-Square statistical tests. Results: findings suggest that undesirable <b>general</b> <b>health</b> status and poor sleep quality rates were 36. 7 % and 50 % respectively. Statistical tests showed significant associations between sleeping quality and <b>general</b> <b>health</b> (p< 0. 001). 50 % and 31. 4 % of permanent daytime workers and shift workers categorized undesirable <b>general</b> <b>health</b> respectively. Furthermore, poor sleeping quality was 57. 1 % and 47. 1 % in permanent daytime workers and shift workers. There was no significant association between shift work with <b>general</b> <b>health</b> (p= 0. 33) and sleeping quality (p= 0. 75). Conclusion: According to our findings, intervention planning should focus on reducing physical stressors and workers’ education on healthy sleeping...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse how self-assessed <b>general</b> <b>health</b> was related to oral health among persons afflicted with whiplash-associated {{disorders}} (WAD), controlling for relevant background factors, confounders and other risk factors. Questionnaires included the SF- 36 Health Survey, self-assessed oral health and relevant risk factors, in total 49 questions. Multivariable regression modelling was performed. Members of a nationwide Swedish association enlisting persons who have problems concerning a whiplash injury (n = 1, 928) were included. A total of 979 persons participated in the study, a response rate of 50. 8 %. A multivariable regression model is presented, with <b>general</b> <b>health</b> as the dependent variable, and the independent variables inserted en-bloc. The model was highly significant with an explained variance of 28 %. Among background factors, only older age appeared as significantly and strongly related to poorer <b>general</b> <b>health.</b> The strongest explanatory contributions came from the health related variables. Oral disease and extra-oral body pain were both strongly related to poorer <b>general</b> <b>health,</b> most obviously for the oral disease variable. Oral disease was significantly and to a clinically relevant degree associated with self-assessed <b>general</b> <b>health.</b> Several other psychosocial indicators of stress were also significantly related to the <b>general</b> <b>health.</b> These findings are consistent with the stress-behaviour-immune model for development of disease...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to identify mediators of the effects of a combined resistance and aerobic exercise program on perceived physical and <b>general</b> <b>health</b> in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. METHODS In total, 57 patients with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of resistance and aerobic exercise or usual care. The outcome measures of physical and <b>general</b> <b>health</b> were assessed by standardized questionnaires. Linear regression analyses were conducted on the residual change scores of the variables. The mediating effects of fatigue, muscle strength, and functional performance on the intervention's effect on physical and <b>general</b> <b>health</b> were examined using the product of coefficients method. Bootstrapping was used to calculate the 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs). RESULTS The exercise intervention was found to significantly improve physical (beta, 5. 03; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 9. 04) and <b>general</b> <b>health</b> (beta, 12. 89; 95 % CI, 2. 24 - 23. 54). Upper body muscle strength and walking speed significantly mediated the intervention effect on physical health (beta, 2. 65; 95 % CI, 0. 64 - 5. 54), accounting for 53 % of the total effect. Walking speed and fatigue were found to be mediators in the intervention effect on <b>general</b> <b>health</b> (beta, 7. 52; 95 % CI, 2. 16 - 16. 92), accounting for 51 % of the total effect. CONCLUSIONS The intervention effects on physical and <b>general</b> <b>health</b> were explained by different mediating mechanisms. Walking speed mediated the intervention effect on both physical and <b>general</b> <b>health.</b> The intervention effect on physical health was further mediated by upper body strength, whereas the effect on <b>general</b> <b>health</b> was mediated by fatigue. © 2013 American Cancer Society...|$|R
