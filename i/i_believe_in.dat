5|$|Your honor, I {{have stated}} in this court that I am {{opposed to the}} form of our present government; that I am opposed to the social system in which we live; that <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> the change of both but by {{perfectly}} peaceable and orderly means....|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> all sincerity {{that if you}} do not deflate the {{opposition}} candidate before your own campaign gets started, the odds are you are doomed to defeat. I believe it is a smear to attack an individual on matters that have no relationship whatsoever to the campaign... {{but it is not a}} smear if you point out the record of your opponent.|$|E

40|$|When I {{was a young}} man, I {{was doing}} a lot of civil rights, civil liberties, and indigent {{criminal}} defense work, and <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the constitutionalized adversarial system. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the constitutional rights of the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment, due process of law, the right to the effective assistance of counsel, the right to trial including an advocate {{who was going to be}} your champion against a hostile world. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the right to confront witnesses against you, the privilege against self-incrimination, equal protection of the laws, and of the right of autonomy of each of us to decide the important things in his or her life...|$|R

60|$|Home {{had never}} been a very {{pleasant}} place to me, because of my sister's temper. But, Joe had sanctified it, and <b>I</b> had <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> it. <b>I</b> had <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the best parlor as a most elegant saloon; <b>I</b> had <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls; <b>I</b> had <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment; <b>I</b> had <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the forge as the glowing road to manhood and independence. Within a single year all this was changed. Now it was all coarse and common, and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella see it on any account.|$|R

5|$|After I {{released}} my solo record I {{felt really}} disappointed, <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the record <b>I</b> made {{but if you}} don't have the back-up of your record company investing and marketing it.

25|$|Harvey {{starred in}} leading roles for two movies with Lewis Gilbert, Scarlet Thread (1951) and There Is Another Sun (1951). For Ealing he made <b>I</b> <b>Believe</b> <b>in</b> You (1952), then he starred {{in a low}} budget thriller, A Killer Walks (1952).|$|E

25|$|Certainly, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> {{collaborating with}} the {{employer}}s! That is what unions are for. I even believe in helping an employer function more productively.

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> Norwich, my Alma Mater, because {{within her}} halls {{throughout}} the years these tenets have found expression while men have been taught to be loyal to duly constituted authority in thought and word and deed; to view suffrage as a sacred privilege to be exercised only {{in accordance with the}} dictates of conscience; to regard public office as a public trust; and finally to fight, and if need be to die, in defense of the cherished institutions of America.|$|E

25|$|Carlos, Verdi baritone. Incorporating {{the deep}} tones that a bass has, while having an upper range {{approaching}} {{that of a}} tenor, Carlos' voice type is high even for a usual baritone. A Verdi baritone refers to a voice capable of singing consistently and with ease in the highest part of the baritone range, up to A4, sometimes even up to the B♭4. The extent of his range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he can sing from G♭2 up to B♭4. The *unofficial* sheet music for their first album claims he sings down to a D2, however this is atypical of a baritone. Most basses would not even be required to sing such notes. During the Live at The Greek Theatre concert, he hit B4 singing <b>I</b> <b>Believe</b> <b>in</b> You.|$|E
25|$|Outside her chart career, Scallon had {{remained}} a popular personality since her 1970 Eurovision win. She had played {{the part of}} a tinker girl in Flight of the Doves (1971), a children's adventure film starring Ron Moody and Jack Wild and directed by Ralph Nelson. She also performed in summer seasons at resorts and seasonal pantomimes as well as performing at venues such as the Royal Albert Hall, the Royal Festival Hall and a week of sell-out shows at the London Palladium. Scallon also performed extensively in cabaret venues and was voted Top Female Vocalist at the National Club Acts Awards in 1979. BBC Television gave her two shows of her own: a series of A Day with Dana in 1974 and four series of Wake Up Sunday in 1979. For BBC Radio she presented a series of <b>I</b> <b>Believe</b> <b>in</b> Music in 1977.|$|E
25|$|We {{are entirely}} in accord in admitting the {{existence}} of God. How can I doubt His when I am convinced of mine. Who so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, {{it would be to}} doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now then, my faith in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: Plus Supra!...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.|$|E
40|$|Ever since puberty, <b>I</b> have <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> {{the value}} of two things: {{kindness}} and clear thinking. At first these two remained more or less distinct; when I felt triumphant <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> most <b>in</b> clear thinking, and in the opposite mood <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> most <b>in</b> kindness. Gradually, the two have come more and more together in my feelings. I find that much unclear thought exists {{as an excuse for}} cruelty and that much cruelty is prompted by superstitious beliefs.
