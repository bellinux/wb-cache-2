It wasn't until the late 1950s until any major development was started. During this time, the construction of manufactured waterfront bungalows on lagoons were built and marketed as vacation properties, most notably Mystic Island, Holly Lake Harbor, as well as Atlantis; the latter of which a [...] "research home" [...] was constructed to test hundreds of components and <b>finishing</b> <b>materials</b> for possible inclusion in model homes. Most of the population were seasonal residents from either New York, Philadelphia, or other parts of New Jersey. Several developments were constructed in the decades following around the Mystic Islands area, mostly consisting of townhomes, duplex, and small single-family homes meant to act as either vacation homes or year-round residence.|$|E
50|$|Accuracy: The {{panels and}} blocks made of {{autoclaved}} aerated concrete are produced to the exact sizes needed before they even leave the factory. There is less need for on-site trimming.

50|$|Because the {{building}} structure was brick and concrete {{and could not}} be disassembled, as much of the oya stone as possible, tiles, and other <b>finishing</b> <b>materials</b> were preserved. Demolition of the hotel was completed and materials stored at Meiji-mura by March 1968. A site for the reconstruction was chosen in February 1970, and exterior reconstruction started in March, taking 6 years to complete. Interior reconstruction started in November 1983 after a 7-year pause, and was completed in October 1985, more than 17 years after the demolition.|$|E

50|$|Screed {{has three}} {{meanings}} in building construction. 1) a flat board (screed board, floating screed) or a purpose-made aluminium tool used to smooth and true materials like concrete, stucco and plaster {{after it has}} been placed on a surface or to assist in flattening; 2) a strip of plaster or wood applied to a surface to act as a guide for a screed tool (screed rail, screed strip, screed batten); 3) the material itself which has been flattened with a screed (screed coat). In the UK, screed has also come to describe a thin, top layer of material (traditionally sand and cement), poured in site on top of the structural concrete or insulation, on top of which other <b>finishing</b> <b>materials</b> can be applied, or it can be left bare to achieve a raw effect.|$|E
50|$|Stratford Junior High School is a {{historic}} junior high school building located in the Cherrydale neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia. It was designed in 1949, and built in 1950. An addition was built in 1995. It is a two- to three-story, concrete post-and-beam building clad primarily in buff brick and sandstone veneer. The building is in a high-style International Style architecture. It features a two-story, three bay projecting portico of exposed concrete on four tapered concrete columns. Other features include a flat parapet roof, decorative minimalism, and the strong horizontal qualities of the building emphasized {{by the use of}} <b>finishing</b> <b>materials</b> and banded windows. In 1959, Stratford Junior High School became the first public secondary school in the Commonwealth of Virginia to desegregate with the admission of four African American students.

40|$|A {{process and}} a device for the {{continuous}} production of moulded elements made of anorganically bound materials are presented. A strand of material is compacted in a high-pressure compaction unit {{in such a}} way that its thickness drops below the nominal thickness of the <b>finished</b> <b>material</b> strand and its density exceeds its nominal density. In the following calibration device, no active pressure is applied. It is important here that the material strand passes through a depressurized zone (5) after leaving the high-pressure compaction unit (2) and that then, directly prior to entry into the calibration unit (4), it is so highly compacted that the resilience produced while passing through the depressurized zone (5) is either completely neutralized and the density of the material strand exceeds the nominal density of the <b>finished</b> <b>material</b> strand and the thickness of the said strand is not attained when it is fed into the calibration unit (4) or the resilience is only neutralized to the extent that the thickness of the material strand corresponds to the nominal thickness, and the density of the material strand corresponds to the nominal density of the <b>finished</b> <b>material</b> strand...|$|R

5000|$|In 1995, a {{forensic}} {{analysis of the}} cause of the fire was completed by a team of ten experts led by Robert N. Anderson, a retired engineering professor from San Jose State University. Various possible causes were ruled out. The day had been very hot, but there was no lightning. The investigators found no evidence of arson, or of an electrical fire, since the generator had not been installed. Instead, they identified spontaneous combustion as the most likely cause. Earlier on the day the fire started, a linseed oil finish was being applied to the [...] "magnificent" [...] oak and walnut interior cabinets and woodwork. Workers had previously been rebuked for carelessness with the flammable <b>finishing</b> <b>materials.</b> The fire probably started in oil-soaked cotton rags, in the ground floor dining room, below the library and Jack London's work room. Some of the windows had not yet been installed, allowing free air flow to feed the fire. The fire probably ignited the wood floor first, then spread to the wood wall paneling. By the time the fire was discovered, it was out of control.|$|E
5000|$|In 2014, the Urban Planning Bureau “Heart of the City” {{organised}} {{and conducted}} an international architectural and urban planning {{competition for the}} Development Concept of the historic centre of Kaliningrad. The professional jury panel was represented by Bart Goldhoorn, Hans Stimmann, Barbara Engel, Rasmus Waern, Stephen Willacy, Olov Schultz, Alexander Lozhkin and Anna Brunow. The competition intended {{to find a new}} concept of the urban planning development of the area called “Korolevskaya Gora“ (Germ. Königsberg) and its surroundings (in total 56 ha). The winner emerging out of this competition was the St.Petersburg’s team of architects “Studio 44“ in partnership with St. Petersburg’s Institute of Territorial Development. The winners propose an individual development scenario for each part of the competition area, taking the interplay between heritage and contemporary context to a totally new level. The former Altstadt is thought to become a zone of archaeological investigations with a new medieval city growing on top of the ruined one. The reconstructed historic urban fabric and the strict regulations governing the height and the shape of the buildings, roof-slope angles and the use of <b>finishing</b> <b>materials</b> will generate echoes of something recognizably old-European. The Kneiphof Island is proposed to remain a park with the park alleys and landscape architecture reproducing the grid of the destroyed city blocks. [...] The concept of Studio 44 became a Future Masterplanning category winner at the World Architecture Festival in 2015. [...] The second prize was awarded to the consortium of companies Devillers et Associes (France) + Off-the-grid (Moscow, Russia) + Wall (Moscow, Russia); the two third prizes were won by the British architect Trevor Skempton and the Swedish studio [...] "Hosper Sweden" [...] AB.

50|$|The {{increase}} in protruding and voluminous details was a distinguishing symptom {{in the development}} of Eclecticism in its later period. The most characteristic works by Felsko in this period are the already mentioned apartment buildings at 25, Baznīcas Street and 27/29, Krišjāņa Valdemāra Street, as well as the buildings at 43, Dzirnavu Street (1898), 3, Elizabetes Street (1899), 22, 39 and 49, Ģertrūdes Street (1897, 1899 and 1906), 1 and 1a, A. Kalniņa Street (both 1895), and 13 and 36, Lāčplēša Street (both 1900). The facades of these buildings are like fantastic paintings with very carefully placed filigree elements of orders, cornices, pediments, garlands, cartouches, herms and many other elements of architectural and decorative finish. The reproduction of older, historical means of expression, on which the Eclecticism style was based, is, for the most part, centered on the free interpretation of the forms of the Renaissance; however, it is also possible to encounter Neo-Gothic and other Neo-styles. Neo-Gothicism, in Felsko's interpretation, can be seen on the apartment buildings at 8, Merķeļa Street (1882), and partly on the former pumping station at 194, Maskavas Street (1897). The latter building can be classified also {{as an example of a}} specific sub-style of Eclecticism, the socalled brick style. Another example of it is the Krüger water therapy institution at 18, Baznīcas Street (1884), or a whole series of factory buildings by Felsko — for example, the former Russian-Rhine lead paint factory at 130, Krišjāņa Barona Street (1902—17), the Phoenix carriage and machine factory at 201, Brīvības Street (1895), and others. Felsko had an excellent understanding of various <b>finishing</b> <b>materials.</b> At times, he intertwined bricks with details molded from cement. Such touches are found at the former riding hall at 8, Strēlnieku Street (1895), the city orphan's home at 8, Zeļļu Street (1888; in collaboration with architect Karl Neuburger), the gas holder at 106, Matisa Street (1901), and others. Strict, heavily rustic formal language of the Florentine Renaissance style was employed in the designs of the former Zigra bath-houses at 10, Vaļņu Street (1887), the apartment house at 4, Basteja Boulevard (1898), and several other facades of his buildings.|$|E
