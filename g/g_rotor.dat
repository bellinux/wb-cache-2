40|$|AbstractA full-span free-wake {{method is}} {{coupled with an}} {{unsteady}} panel method to accurately predict the unsteady aerodynamics of helicopter rotor blades in hover and forward flight. The unsteady potential-based panel method is used to consider aerodynamics of finite thickness multi-bladed rotors, and the full-span free-wake method is applied to simulating dynamics of rotor wake. These methods are tightly coupled through trailing-edge Kutta condition and by converting doublet-wake panels to full-span vortex filaments. A velocity-field integration technique is also adopted to overcome singularity problem during {{the interaction between the}} rotor wake and blades. Helicopter rotors including Caradonna–Tung, UH- 60 A, and AH- 1 <b>G</b> <b>rotors,</b> are simulated in hover and forward flight to validate the accuracy of this approach.

40|$|Non-linear {{analysis}} of electrograms (EGM) {{has been proposed}} {{as a tool to}} detect critical conduction sites (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>rotors</b> vortex, multiple wavefronts) in atrial fibrillation (AF). Likewise, studies have shown that multifractal analysis is useful to detect critical activity in EGM signals. However, the multifractal spectrum does not consider the temporal information. There is a new mathematical formalism to overcome this limitation: the timesingularity multifractal spectrum distribution (TS-MFSD), which involves the time variation of the spectrum. In this manuscript, we describe the methodology to compute the TS-MFSD from EGM signals. Moreover, we propose a methodology to extract features from time-singularity spectrum and from singularity energy spectrum (SES). We tested the features in an EGM database labeled by experts as: non-fragmented, discrete fragmented potentials, disorganized activity, and continuous activity. We tested the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The proposed features achieve an area under the ROC curve of 95. 17 % when detecting signals with continuous activity. These results outperform those reported using multifractal analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first work that report the use of TS-MFSD in biomedical signals and our findings suggest that time-singularity {{has the potential to be}} used in the study of non-stationary behavior of EGM signals in AF...|$|R

For other patients of 60 - 80 kg or 80 - 100 kg body weight, the mini axial pumps of 23 mm and 25 mm outer diameter had been developed before, these devices were acknowledged to be the world smallest LVADs by Guinness World Record Center in 2004.
