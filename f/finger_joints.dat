25|$|The tower {{consists}} of four columns. Each roughly pentagonal column {{consists of}} four tapering and/or straight sections, joined end-to-end by external plates and internal stringer <b>finger</b> <b>joints</b> secured with fasteners. The columns are also joined horizontally by sacrificial box structures. These box joins are intended to absorb earthquake-induced motion by elastic and plastic shear deformation as the tower sways. Under a severe earthquake, this deformation absorbs energy that could otherwise lead to destructive tower motion, thus protecting the primary structure of the span. It is expected that this design will allow the immediate use of the bridge for emergency vehicles, with the joins being replaced as needed to restore the bridge to its original condition. Uniquely, the tower has no direct connection to the roadbeds, with enough space to allow swaying under severe earthquakes without collision.|$|E

60|$|Let us {{approach}} {{the business with}} dispassionate explicitness. Let us assume something of the scientific spirit, the hard, almost professorial tone of the conscientious realist. Let us treat this young man's legs as a mere diagram, and indicate the points of interest with the unemotional precision of a lecturer's pointer. And so to our revelation. On the internal aspect of the right ankle of this young man you would have observed, ladies and gentlemen, a contusion and an abrasion; on the internal aspect of the left ankle a contusion also; on its external aspect a large yellowish bruise. On his left shin there were two bruises, one a leaden yellow graduating here and there into purple, and another, obviously of more recent date, of a blotchy red--tumid and threatening. Proceeding up the left leg in a spiral manner, an unnatural hardness and redness would have been discovered on the upper aspect of the calf, and above the knee and on the inner side, an extraordinary expanse of bruised surface, a kind of closely stippled shading of contused points. The right leg would be found to be bruised in a marvellous manner all about and under the knee, and particularly on the interior aspect of the knee. So far we may proceed with our details. Fired by these discoveries, an investigator might perhaps have pursued his inquiries further--to bruises on the shoulders, elbows, and even the <b>finger</b> <b>joints,</b> of the central figure of our story.

40|$|<b>Finger</b> <b>jointing</b> {{of short}} {{off-cuts}} for structural purposes particularly for lightweight roof truss and prefabricated timber house is likely an economical method of minimizing wastage and generating benefits. The {{primary goal of}} this research is on the possibility of using finger-jointed timber with metal plate connectors for structural purposes, i. e. in trusses: internal members, top and bottom chord. This research assessed the strength properties of finger-jointed Strength Group B timber and the influence of number of joints and its positioning on strength. The glue applied for <b>finger</b> <b>jointing</b> is polymer isocyanate adhesive or commercially known as Koyo glue. Bending, compression and tension tests were carried out and the results show that the efficiency of the joints in relation to the strength of the unjointed specimens were greatly influenced by the positioning and number of joints.

Tests on the performance of connection with metal plate using finger-jointed timber showed small difference in the basic working load as compared to the unjointed specimens.
