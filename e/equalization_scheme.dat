40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relation between}} tax competition and fiscal equalization. In particular, it asks the question whether fiscal <b>equalization</b> <b>schemes</b> can mitigate inefficient tax competition. Two transfer schemes are considered: tax revenue and tax base <b>equalization</b> <b>schemes.</b> The paper shows that equalizing transfers may internalize fiscal externalities. In particular, in a small open economy tax base equalization yields efficient tax rates. Thus, transfer mechanisms with an explicit redistributive character do not always impair efficiency.

With a focus on the constructivist [...] works of the 1960s {{associated}} with the “New Tendencies” (Nouvelles Tendances) movement, the short-lived Progressive Museum (1968–1974) set out to “establish a modern collection that would be accessible to the public from the very beginning” and wanted to avoid any sort of “secularized ceremony”. The expansion of education and communication, likewise a mandate stemming from this era, could only be achieved through an increase in funding. Since the mid-1970s, however, increasingly tight budgets and persistent financial difficulties in the public sector have exerted a palpable impact on museums. The museum studies program at the University of Basel could only be offered from 1992 to 1994 due to funding shortages. In the mid-1990s, a government resolution cut the budget of the state museums by ten percent, leading to the 1996 closure of two museums, the Museum of Design (Museum für Gestaltung) and the City and Cathedral Museum (Stadt- und Münstermuseum). The ensuing debate and the pressure from a public referendum in support of the city’s museums led to the adoption of the Basel-City Museums Act (Museumsgesetz) of 1999, which placed the holdings of the remaining five state museums (Museum of Ancient Art, Historical Museum, Kunstmuseum, Museum of Cultures, Natural History Museum) {{in the hands of the}} parliament. As a central component of cultural expenditures, the museums have also been included in the intensified negotiations over the past several years between the two Basel cantons regarding payment for the city-provided services within the framework of a fiscal <b>equalization</b> <b>scheme.</b>|$|E

50|$|Normally, {{under the}} <b>{{equalization}}</b> <b>scheme,</b> equalization payments go down {{for every dollar}} increase in a province's ability to raise taxes. So, for example, if a province's economy booms and the provincial government's potential income tax revenues increase, equalization payments decrease. Economist Michael Smart has argued that this gives have-not provinces an incentive to raise taxes, because any harm higher taxes do to the economy is off-set by higher equalization payments.|$|E

More recently, various iterative <b>equalization</b> <b>schemes</b> based on successive cancelation of ICI and CAI [9 – 13] or turbo principle [9, 14 – 16] were proposed. A brief survey of the iterative <b>equalization</b> <b>schemes</b> published in the last decade and how they differ from the proposed scheme is given in the sequel. In general, turbo-like iterative schemes are found to have superior performance compared to others, but they usually suffer from high computation complexity, albeit at varying degrees, and thus require high silicon area for implementation and high battery power for operation. Such practical application challenges have motivated us to propose a new low-complexity detector scheme for OFDM-MIMO with an improved trade-off between performance and implementation complexity in [17] and in this study.|$|R

In this article, we propose a suboptimal, successive interference cancelation (SIC)-based maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding in doubly dispersive channels for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) MIMO systems (SIC-MAP-MIMO). SIC-MAP-MIMO leverages on the soft feedback symbol estimate to remove the intercarrier interference and coantenna interference from the received data thus making the subsequent MAP decoding simple. Extrinsic information transfer chart analysis supplemented with numerical simulation results show that SIC-MAP-MIMO achieves comparable BER performance to similar <b>equalization</b> <b>schemes</b> but with significant computational savings.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} equalization methods for cooperative diversity schemes over frequency-selective fading channels. Specifically, we consider three <b>equalization</b> <b>schemes</b> proposed originally for conventional space-time block codes (STBC) [1]–[3] and extend them to distributed STBC in a cooperative transmission scenario with amplify-and-forward relaying. The distributed STBC <b>equalization</b> <b>schemes</b> are named after their original counterparts as distributed time-reversal (D-TR) STBC, distributed single-carrier (D-SC) STBC, and distributed orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (D-OFDM) STBC. The underlying orthogonality of distributed STBC results in decoupled data streams at the receiver side allowing low-complexity implementations. Without loss of generality, we consider a single-relay scenario where the source-to-relay, relay-to-destination, and source-to-destination links experience possibly different channel delay spreads.
