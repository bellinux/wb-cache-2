5|$|After {{completing}} {{training in}} Palestine, in early 1941, the 2/15th took up positions {{along the front}} line in the Western Desert, before being pushed back to Tobruk. Between April and October 1941, along with a garrison of British and other Australian personnel, the battalion helped to hold the strategically important port, which had been surrounded following the landing of German troops at Tripoli. It was withdrawn by sea in late October 1941 as the 9th Division was relieved by the British 70th Division. Following its withdrawal from Tobruk, the battalion re-formed at Gaza before undertaking garrison duties in Syria. In mid-1942, the 2/15th returned to North Africa to fight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>and</b> Second Battles of El Alamein.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Chinese Daoism, {{ancestor}} worship, and foreign-originated Buddhism {{were the}} most prominent religious practices in the Song period. Daoism developed largely from {{the teachings of the}} Daodejing, attributed to the 6th century BC philosopher Laozi ("Old Master"), considered one of the Three Pure Ones (the prime deities of Daoism). Buddhism in China, introduced by Yuezhi, Persian, and Kushan missionaries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> second centuries, gradually became more native in character and was transformed into distinct Chinese Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Pringle, {{who played}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>and</b> Second Tests, {{none of the}} six new {{selections}} had played in the series so far, but the match followed the old pattern, as the England batting again failed twice against the hostile West Indies pace attack, only Lamb and Smith in the first innings and Gooch in the second offering much resistance. The side fell to a relatively facile defeat against a West Indies team whose own batsmen failed to dominate; they had no need. Curtly Ambrose secured his first man-of-the-match award for taking seven wickets {{at a cost of}} 98 runs - despite being hampered early on in the match, when a blocked drain resulted in the bowler's run-up area being waterlogged and in some places flooded with overflow rainwater, Ambrose being hapless bowler who was forced to bring the situation {{to the attention of the}} umpires so that play could be suspended and the playing area dried out.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{competed in}} the UEFA Cup in the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons and {{departed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> second round to FC Winterslag and Spartak Moscow respectively. The Heysel Stadium disaster of May 1985, during the 1985 European Cup Final between Liverpool and Juventus resulted in UEFA, and later FIFA, imposing a 'worldwide' ban on English teams from participating in European club competitions, initially for an indefinite period. Under George Graham, Arsenal returned to the European Cup in the 1991–92 season, having won the league championship a season earlier. They {{went out in the}} second round to Portuguese team Benfica in November 1991. The ban arising from the Heysel disaster had prevented Arsenal from competing in the European Cup when they won the league title two years previously, as well as preventing them from competing in the UEFA Cup on two occasions.|$|E

5|$|As with Georgia, Virginia Tech's {{kicking and}} special teams proved {{to have more}} success than either aspect of the offense. Virginia Tech kicker Brandon Pace scored a single 28-yard field goal late in the fourth quarter, and punter Nic Schmitt blasted four punts {{for a total of}} 195yards, {{averaging}} 48.8yards a punt. Pace's field goal helped to trigger a late-game rally by Virginia Tech, which had been stunned by a Georgia onside kick and several interceptions thrown by Glennon. Schmitt's long punts, meanwhile, denied Georgia good field position {{in the first half of}} the game. Only in the second half, when Glennon's interceptions allowed Georgia to start on the Tech side of the field, was the Georgia offense able to reach the end zone. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> second quarters, Georgia's average starting position was their own 19-yard line and own 26-yard line, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Before 1914, Southern Rhodesia's {{police force}} was the British South Africa Police (BSAP), first raised in 1889 and reconstituted {{into a more}} {{permanent}} form in 1896. This paramilitary, mounted infantry force was theoretically also the country's standing army. Organised along military lines, it served <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>and</b> Second Matabele Wars of the 1890s, operated on Britain's side in the Anglo-Boer War of 1899–1902 (alongside the specially-raised Rhodesia Regiment), and by 1914 comprised about 1,150 men (including officers). Reserves existed {{in the form of}} the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers, an all-white amateur force with a paper strength of 2,000 intended for mobilisation against local uprisings. Few doubted the Volunteers' enthusiasm, but they were not extensively trained or equipped; though perhaps useful in a Rhodesian bush skirmish, most observers agreed they would be no match for professional soldiers in a conventional war. In any case, the Volunteers' enlistment contracts bound them for domestic service only.|$|E
5|$|Both teams traded {{touchdowns in}} the third. The Tigers scored first on a 75-yard Rueben Randle {{reception}} from Jordan Jefferson, and the Crimson Tide responded with a five-yard Mark Ingram touchdown run. LSU scored 14 fourth quarter points to secure the victory {{with a pair of}} Jasper field goals and a one-yard Stevan Ridley touchdown run and a successful two-point conversion. Alabama responded with a nine-yard Julio Jones touchdown reception, but was unable to get a defensive stop late in the game preserving the 24–21 LSU victory. Turnovers proved costly for Alabama with LSU scoring field goals on drives after a McElroy interception <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> fumble in the fourth. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 45–24–5.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{communities}} grew {{quickly in}} many parts of the empire (and especially in the East) after 260, when Gallienus brought peace to the Church. The data to calculate the figures are nearly non-existent, but the historian and sociologist Keith Hopkins has given crude and tentative estimates for Christian population in the 3rd century. Hopkins estimates that the Christian community grew from a population of 1.1 million in 250 to a population of 6 million by 300, about 10% of the empire's total population. Christians even expanded into the countryside, where they had never been numerous before. Churches in the later 3rd century were no longer as inconspicuous as they had been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> second. Large churches were prominent in certain major cities throughout the empire. The church in Nicomedia even sat on a hill overlooking the imperial palace. These new churches probably represented not only absolute growth in Christian population, but also the increasing affluence of the Christian community. In some areas where Christians were influential, such as North Africa and Egypt, traditional deities were losing credibility.|$|E
