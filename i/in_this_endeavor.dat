5|$|Beginning with William Stanley Jevons and Clément Juglar in the 1860s, economists {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} cycles of frequent, violent shifts in economic activity. A key milestone <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>endeavor</b> was {{the foundation of the}} U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research by Wesley Mitchell in 1920. This marked the beginning of a boom in atheoretical, statistical models of economic fluctuation (models based on cycles and trends instead of economic theory) that led to the discovery of apparently regular economic patterns like the Kuznets wave.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his service}} as governor, Morehead resumed his legal {{practice}} in Frankfort, Kentucky. In March 1837, he {{was commissioned by}} Governor James Clark {{to act as an}} agent for the state, selling bonds to fund internal improvements. He returned to the state House from 1837 to 1838, representing Franklin County. He was president of the Kentucky Board of Internal Improvements from 1838 to 1841, and in 1839, he and John Speed Smith were chosen as commissioners to the state of Ohio to secure the return of Kentucky-owned slaves as property of their masters. They were successful <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>endeavor.</b>|$|E
5|$|President Tyler {{appointed}} Wickliffe as Postmaster General following Wickliffe's term as governor. While {{aboard a}} steamship in 1844, he was stabbed {{by a man}} who was later found to be insane. In 1845, President James K. Polk sent Wickliffe on a secret mission to report on British and French intents with regard to annexing Texas and to assess the feasibility of the United States undertaking such an action. Wickliffe's participation <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>endeavor</b> further distanced him from the Whigs.|$|E

5|$|James Cook's voyages of 1771–74 {{demonstrated}} conclusively {{the likely}} hostile nature of any hidden lands. This caused {{a shift of}} emphasis {{in the first half}} of the 19th century, away from trade and towards sealing and whaling, and then exploration and discovery. After the first overwintering on continental Antarctica in 1898-99 (Adrien de Gerlache), the prospect of reaching the South Pole appeared realistic, and the race for the pole began. The British were pre-eminent <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>endeavor,</b> which was characterized by the rivalry between Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. Shackleton's efforts fell short; Scott reached the pole in January 1912 only to find that he had been beaten by the Norwegian Amundsen.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{parallels}} that Nibley {{has been able}} to uncover from amazingly disparate and arcane sources is truly staggering. Unfortunately, {{there seems to be a}} neglect of any methodological reflection or articulation <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>endeavor.</b>|$|E
25|$|In January 2004, the United Nations {{estimated}} that a reconstruction of Bam would cost between US$700 million and $1 billion.

25|$|The crown group mammals, {{sometimes}} called 'true mammals', are the extant mammals {{and their relatives}} back to their last common ancestor. Since this group has living members, DNA analysis can be applied {{in an attempt to}} explain the evolution of features that do not appear <b>in</b> fossils. <b>This</b> <b>endeavor</b> often involves molecular phylogenetics, a technique that has become popular since the mid-1980s.|$|R

25|$|The {{importance}} of Machiavelli's influence is notable in many important figures <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>endeavor,</b> for example Bodin, Francis Bacon, Algernon Sidney, Harrington, John Milton, Spinoza, Rousseau, Hume, Edward Gibbon, and Adam Smith. Although {{he was not}} always mentioned by name as an inspiration, due to his controversy, he is also {{thought to have been}} an influence for other major philosophers, such as Montaigne, Descartes, Hobbes, Locke and Montesquieu.|$|E

25|$|Vogt-Mugnier and her husband's main {{interest}} was {{the identification and}} characterization of distinct regions in the neocortex by both functional and structural criteria. The Vogts were attempting to precisely locate the regions in the cerebral cortex that correlate with specific brain functions. This also motivated their experimental work on electrostimulation of the cortices in 150 monkeys. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>endeavor,</b> they collaborated with Korbinian Brodmann to map areas of the cortex and the thalamus.|$|E
25|$|Harvey {{initially}} {{balked at}} the suggestion that in-transit dining facilities be added to all AT trains operating west of Kansas City. Eventually, Harvey agreed to support the railroad <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>endeavor,</b> and the California Limited became the first AT's name trains to feature Harvey Company meal service en route. Later trains, such as the vaunted Super Chief, included dining cars (staffed by Fred Harvey Company personnel) {{as part of the}} standard passenger car complement right from the outset.|$|E
25|$|After the {{disastrous}} publication of The Confidence-Man in 1857, Melville {{turned to the}} writing of poetry. Virtually ignored by the public and scorned by reviewers, he nevertheless persevered <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>endeavor</b> for the next 30 years. The perception then was of Melville as a novelist who dabbled unsuccessfully in verse, a view held by many even today. Although the poetry has survived via the revival of Melville's fiction, it remains on the whole where it was during his lifetime: hard to find, seldom read, and generally regretted.|$|E

25|$|The Sultanate of Hobyo was a 19th-century Somali kingdom {{founded by}} Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid. Initially, Kenadid's {{goal was to}} seize control of the {{neighboring}} Majeerteen Sultanate, which was then ruled by his cousin Boqor Osman Mahamuud. However, he was unsuccessful <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>endeavor,</b> and was eventually forced into exile in Yemen. A decade later, in the 1870s, Kenadid returned from the Arabian Peninsula with a band of Hadhrami musketeers {{and a group of}} devoted lieutenants. With their assistance, he managed to establish the kingdom of Hobyo, which would rule much of northeastern and central Somalia during the early modern period.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} an exegetical trend during {{the last several decades}} to draw endless {{parallels}} to text from the ancient Near East and beyond in an attempt to validate the writings in the Book of Mormon and Pearl of Great Price. The pioneer and leader in this effort has been the great LDS scholar Hugh Nibley. In recent years the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) has continued this legacy. The number of parallels that Nibley has been able to uncover from amazingly disparate and arcane sources is truly staggering. Unfortunately, {{there seems to be a}} neglect of any methodological reflection or articulation <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>endeavor.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nicholas Cooke (February 3, 1717September 14, 1782) was a {{governor}} of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations during the American Revolutionary War, and after Rhode Island became a state, he continued in this position {{to become the first}} Governor of the State of Rhode Island. Born in the maritime town of Providence, he early in life followed the sea, eventually becoming a Captain of ships. This occupation led him to become a merchant, becoming highly successful <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>endeavor,</b> and he ran a distillery and rope-making business as well. He is depicted as one of the affluent merchants in John Greenwood's satirical painting from the 1750s entitled Sea Captains Carousing in Surinam.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the Danish Jews {{were rescued}} by {{the unwillingness of}} the Danish {{government}} and people to acquiesce {{to the demands of}} the occupying forces and through their concerted efforts to ferry Danish Jews to Sweden during October 1943. <b>In</b> total, <b>this</b> <b>endeavor</b> saved nearly 8,000 Jews from certain death; another 425 who were sent to Theresienstadt [...] were also saved due to the determination of the Danes and returned to their homes following the war. About 1,500 of the roughly 8,000 Jews rescued by the Danes were recent refugees from Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Germany.|$|R
25|$|After the {{resignation}} of Rufus King, Monroe was appointed as the ambassador to Great Britain in 1803. The greatest issue of contention between the United States and Britain {{was that of the}} impressment of U.S. sailors. Many U.S. merchant ships employed British seamen who had deserted or dodged conscription, and the British frequently impressed sailors on U.S. ships in hopes of quelling their manpower issues. However, many of the sailors they impressed had never been British subjects, and Monroe was tasked with persuading the British to stop their practice of impressment. Monroe found little success <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>endeavor,</b> partly due to Jefferson's alienation of the British minister to the United States, Anthony Merry. Rejecting Jefferson's offer to serve as the first governor of Louisiana Territory, Monroe continued to serve as ambassador to Britain until 1807.|$|E
25|$|After {{the success}} of the BMW IIIa aeromotor, it was decided that Karl Rapp's {{contract}} be terminated by the managing board of Rapp Motorenwerke. Franz Josef Popp was appointed as managing director of the company, while at the same time, the name of the company was changed from Rapp Motorenwerke into Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH. This was intended to signal a new beginning to the outside world. Following conversion into a joint-stock company, he was head of the Bayerische Motoren Werke as Chairman of the Board of Management with the title General Director. At the end of the First World War, Popp was responsible for switching the young company from aircraft engine production to peacetime production. With this aim in mind, he worked towards creating a link with Knorr Bremse AG, and from 1919 onwards, the factory started manufacturing Knorr brakes for the Bavarian Railway. In 1922, Popp was responsible for transferring the most important patents, machinery and personnel for engine manufacture “to the umbrella of the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG”, together with the company name “Bayerische Motoren Werke AG”. He was assisted <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>endeavor</b> by the Austrian financier Camillo Castiglioni. In this way he was able to break free from Knorr Bremse AG and start up engine construction once more.|$|E
