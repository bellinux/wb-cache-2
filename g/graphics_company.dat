5|$|The Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year, {{originally}} {{known as}} the Diagram Group Prize for the Oddest Title at the Frankfurt Book Fair, commonly {{known as the}} Diagram Prize for short, is a humorous literary award that is given annually to a book with an unusual title. The prize is named after the Diagram Group, an information and <b>graphics</b> <b>company</b> based in London, and The Bookseller, a British trade magazine for the publishing industry. Originally organised to provide entertainment during the 1978 Frankfurt Book Fair, the prize has since been awarded every year by The Bookseller and is now organised by the magazine's diarist Horace Bent. The winner was initially decided by a panel of judges, but since 2000 the winner has been decided by a public vote on The Booksellerâ€²s website.|$|E

25|$|Following AMD's 2006 {{acquisition}} of Canadian <b>graphics</b> <b>company</b> ATI Technologies, an initiative codenamed Fusion was announced to integrate a CPU and GPU together {{on some of}} AMD's microprocessors, including a built in PCI Express link to accommodate separate PCI Express peripherals, eliminating the northbridge chip from the motherboard. The initiative intended to move some of the processing originally done on the CPU (e.g. floating-point unit operations) to the GPU, which is better optimized for some calculations. The Fusion was later renamed to the AMD APU (Accelerated Processing Unit).|$|E
500|$|The artwork for {{the album}} was created by German {{designer}} Carsten Drescher and his <b>graphics</b> <b>company</b> Media Logistics. Drescher {{was responsible for the}} After Forever logo and the cover concepts of every After Forever album and single since then. The girl he photographed is in fact his daughter Aimee Drescher, who also appeared in the video clip for the song [...] "Digital Diceit". He inserted the photos in a dark urban landscape tinted blue, completing the front cover artwork with the digital overlay of circles in the water to evoke the title of the album. The same circles were extensively used in the CD booklet and in every other artwork related to the album. Together with the dominant blue colour the circles were also present in the live show scenography.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the special}} effects in the film, created by Hong Kong {{computer}} <b>graphics</b> <b>company</b> Centro Digital Pictures Limited, which had previously worked on films such as Shaolin Soccer and Kill Bill, included a combination of computer-generated imagery and wire work. [...] Centro Digital performed extensive tests on CGI scenes before filming started, and treatment of the preliminary shots began immediately afterwards. The CGI crew edited out wire effects and applied special effects in high resolution. Legendary martial arts mentioned in wuxia novels were depicted and exaggerated through CGI, but actual people {{were used for the}} final fight between Chow's character and hundreds of axe-wielding gangsters. [...] After a final calibration of colour, data of the processed scenes was sent to the US for the production of the final version. A group of six people followed the production crew throughout the shooting.|$|E

500|$|Pilotwings 64 was co-developed by the Texas-based <b>graphics</b> <b>company</b> Paradigm Simulation and Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis and Development (EAD) and Integrated Research and Development (IRD) divisions. Due to Paradigm's {{experience}} with Silicon Graphics workstations, Nintendo contacted the American company in 1994 concerning it {{becoming one of}} the Nintendo 64's [...] "Dream Team" [...] of first developers. Paradigm worked directly with a team at Silicon Graphics and spent nine months developing a technology base for Pilotwings 64 and Paradigm's other Nintendo 64 releases. Development on Pilotwings 64 began in earnest during June 1995, with Nintendo working on the game design and Paradigm working on the technical production. Nintendo's Genyo Takeda and Makoto Wada acted as Paradigm's primary technical and design contacts individually. Wada, the game's director, was also involved in design aspects such as modeling and animation. Shigeru Miyamoto, the producer of Pilotwings for the SNES, reprised his role for Pilotwings 64 and oversaw the project from Japan. Miyamoto's involvement was more removed than with the SNES game due to his simultaneous work on the platformer Super Mario 64.|$|E
500|$|The Wrath of Khan {{was one of}} {{the first}} films to {{extensively}} use electronic images and computer graphics to speed production of shots. Computer <b>graphics</b> <b>company</b> Evans & Sutherland produced the vector graphics displays aboard the Enterprise and the fields of stars used in the opening credits. Among ILM's technical achievements was cinema's first entirely computer-generated sequence: the demonstration of the effects of the Genesis Device on a barren planet. The first concept for the shot took the form of a laboratory demonstration, where a rock would be placed in a chamber and turned into a flower. Veilleux suggested the sequence's scope be expanded to show the Genesis effect taking over a planet. While Paramount appreciated the more dramatic presentation, they also wanted the simulation to be more impressive than traditional animation. Having seen research done by Lucasfilm's Computer Graphics group, Veilleux offered them the task. The graphics team paid attention to detail for the sixty-second sequence; one artist ensured that the stars visible in the background matched those visible from a real star light-years from Earth. The animators hoped it would serve as a [...] "commercial" [...] for the studio's talents. The studio would later branch off from Lucasfilm to form Pixar.|$|E

Understanding the key Six Sigma factors (Total Quality Management, strong customer focus, data analysis tools, financial results and project management) allows organizations to better support their strategic directions focused on improving customer requirements through the improving of own business systems and operational performances.
