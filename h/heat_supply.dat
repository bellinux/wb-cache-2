500|$|In 2010, 11.4% of the <b>heat</b> <b>supply</b> in Estonia was {{generated}} by direct combustion of oil shale and 5.88% by combustion of shale oil.

[...] Heat produced by co-generation at the Balti Power Station is used for district heating of Narva, the third largest city in Estonia with 58,700 inhabitants (2013). The co-generation plants in Kohtla-Järve, Sillamäe, and Kiviõli burn oil shale to produce electrical power and supply district heating to nearby towns. In addition to raw oil shale, the Kohtla-Järve Power Station uses oil shale gas, a by-product of shale oil production, for the same purposes.|$|E

5000|$|From 1962 the <b>heat</b> <b>supply</b> of {{two cities}} {{was started by}} 26 -km heat {{transport}} system SUGRES-Sverdlovsk that was unique in that period.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} achieve high {{utilization}} efficiency of residual heat by reducing the energy conversion process, a new combined heat-supply system based on groundwater heat pump and steam turbine was designed. By obtaining operational principle and mathematicalmodel, the cop and the consumption of steam were analyzed and calculated, based on the combined <b>heating</b> <b>supply</b> system with different chilled water temperature of condenser. The cop increases firstly and decreases later with the outlet water temperature of the condenser rising. But the total steam consumption of combined <b>heating</b> <b>supply</b> system is quite contrary. The steam consumption of the <b>heating</b> <b>supply</b> system reaches a lowest value when the outlet temperature of the condenser is set as 84 °C...|$|R
