Sound and Vib. 86, 23 – 46 (1983) ] are considered for the prediction of sound propagation over multiple impedance discontinuities. A limitation in the original formulation of the De Jong model is highlighted and a modified form that overcomes this limitation is derived based on reciprocity. This leads {{to the development of}} a model for multiple impedance discontinuities that can be used for the investigation of sound-wave propagation above a mixed, striped soft ground that is created by either porous absorbent strips, <b>embedded</b> <b>grooves,</b> or wells with different depths. The accuracy of the model is validated against the boundary element method. It is then used to evaluate the importance of the imaginary part of the admittance of the ground strips on sound attenuation along welled surface. It is shown that the attenuation performance of a surface with multiple impedance discontinuities is high when the imaginary part of the average admittance is large and negative (with an −iωt convention), but the magnitudes of the attenuation peaks are also substantially affected by diffraction from the impedance discontinuities. © 2006 Acoustical Society of Americ...|$|R

POFs with 1 mm in diameter were <b>embedded</b> in <b>grooves,</b> realized in planar supports with different lengths, and polished to remove the cladding and part of the core.

Considering the refractive index (RI) range (1. 33 – 1. 39), the sensitivity and the resolution of the sensor were strongly dependent on the sensing region length. The highest sensitivity (resolution of 6. 48 × 10 − 3 refractive index units, RIU) was obtained with 6 cm sensing length. In the RI range (1. 41 – 1. 47), the length of the sensing region was not a critical aspect to obtain the best resolution.

40|$|Near {{surface mounted}} (NSM) fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) reinforcement represents a valid alternative to externally bonded (EB) FRP reinforcement for strengthening existing reinforced concrete (RC) elements. NSM composites are usually comprised of glass, carbon, and aramid fiber reinforcement with circular (bars) or prismatic (strips) cross-section.

The experimental database is employed to assess the accuracy of the analytical provisions obtained following the American, English, Canadian, and Italian guidelines. The assessment shows that, although conservative, the analytical models considered are (relatively) poorly accurate and further studies are needed to provide a reliable tool for designing RC flexural strengthening with NSM reinforcement...|$|R

The NSM method is an emerging strengthening technique for RC structures, where FRP bars are <b>embedded</b> into <b>grooves</b> cut in the cover of RC members. In both cases, strain monitoring of the FRP bars is desirable either for the investigation of the structural behavior or for the long-term health monitoring of the structure. This paper presents a study in which fiber-optic sensors were embedded into glass FRP (GFRP) bars to produce smart GFRP bars for NSM applications. The manufacturing process of the smart FRP bars is illustrated and their performance in tensile, bond and beam flexural tests is examined to assess the effectiveness of these smart FRP bars for achieving the dual purpose of structural strengthening and strain monitoring. On the basis of the test results, the advantages and limitations of fiber-optic sensors compared to electrical strain gages in the strain monitoring of NSM FRP bars are discussed.

30|$|The microplowing {{phenomenon}} is primarily seen on very soft surfaces. The key indicator for this mechanism is a strain {{in a relatively}} large area around the surface tracks. In this case, scratches on the soft body would not scrape off the material, and the material only move {{on the surface and}} is regularly stored as a bulge {{on both sides of the}} created groove. Transfer of microplowing mechanism to microcutting takes place when the hardness of the material is increased. If the hardness of the sliding surface increases more and more, the abrasive wear can transform to microcracking. In this mechanism, the particles are rubbed off due to the formation and growth phenomenon of a crack <b>embedded</b> in the <b>grooves.</b> Particles accumulated in slots around the abrasive surface move constantly that would lead to a microfatigue phenomenon [31].|$|R

40|$|The dorsal ligaments of arcoid {{bivalves}} typically {{consist of}} oblique, lamellar and fibrous sheets, alternating along the hinge {{so that their}} attachments form characteristic chevron patterns. New elements are added {{at or near the}} middle of the pattern, as the ligament grows ventrally and gets longer. Most Palaeozoic arcoids exhibit this growth pattern, which still predominates among their living descendants. Early in the Cretaceous, a novel pattern emerged, with vertical strips of lamellar ligament <b>embedded</b> in <b>grooves</b> in the sheet of fibrous ligament which is attached to each valve. In contrast with the chevron, duplivincular ligament, new elements are added to each end of the noetiid ligament, anteriorly and posteriorly. This distinctive growth pattern is the defining character of the family Noetiidae. Remarkable variation among individuals within populations of a living limopsid arcoid includes Forms with vertical strips of lamellar ligament. These variants suggest how the noetiid growth pattern could have been derived from the duplivincular pattern. Computer simulations show that such patterns can be generated by a reaction-diffusion mechanism of the sort first conceived by Turing (1952, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society London, Series B, 237, 37 - 72). Moreover. the noetiid growth pattern can simply be derived from the duplivincular pattern by a developmental switch based, for example, on a change in boundary conditions. These results indicate that striking differences in form may arise from modest changes in the developmental process. The evolution of the Noetiidae, members of which are quite disparate in overall shell form, should be reassessed. The derived character on which this Family is based may nor be uniquely shared, so the group could well be polyphyletic...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCapillary {{electrophoresis}} {{has been}} used to characterize the interaction of monovalent cations with 26 -basepair DNA oligomers containing A-tracts embedded in flanking sequences with different basepair compositions. A 26 -basepair random-sequence oligomer was used as the reference; lithium and tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) ions were used as the probe ions. The free solution mobilities of the A-tract and random-sequence oligomers were identical in solutions containing <∼ 100  mM cation. At higher cation concentrations, the A-tract oligomers migrated faster than the reference oligomer in TBA+ and slower than the reference in Li+. Hence, cations of different sizes can interact very differently with DNA A-tracts. The increased mobilities observed in TBA+ suggest that the large hydrophobic TBA+ ions are preferentially excluded from the vicinity of the A-tract minor groove, increasing the effective net charge of the A-tract oligomers and increasing the mobility. By contrast, Li+ ions decrease the mobility of A-tract oligomers because of the preferential localization of Li+ ions in the narrow A-tract minor <b>groove.</b> <b>Embedding</b> the A-tracts in AT-rich flanking sequences markedly alters preferential interactions of monovalent cations with the B∗ conformation.

The motivation of this work is to measure in situ process parameters using integrated sensors in a workpiece in order to characterize the manufacturing process. Resistive sensors that operate on the same principle as conventional strain gauges were fabricated on wafers made of steel using standard microtechnology and later the wafers were diced to form unique sensor-integrated steel components (sensor inlays). These inlays are <b>embedded</b> into a <b>groove</b> on the top surface of a cylindrical workpiece using epoxy adhesive. The workpiece is also made of the same steel as the sensor wafers and has similar properties due to a heat treatment process, thereby maintaining the homogeneity of the material over the whole contact area.

The sensor response to the internal strain was recorded during every grinding step starting from a depth of 1  mm down to 2  mm from the top surface.

40|$|The ribosome-associated {{chaperone}} {{trigger factor}} (TF) assists the folding of newly synthesized cytosolic proteins in Escherichia coli. Here, we determined the substrate specificity of TF by examining its binding to 2842 membrane-coupled 13 meric peptides. The binding motif of TF {{was identified as}} a stretch of eight amino acids, enriched in basic and aromatic residues and with a positive net charge. Fluorescence spectroscopy verified that TF exhibited a comparable substrate specificity for peptides in solution. The affinity to peptides in solution was low, indicating that TF requires ribosome association to create high local concentrations of nascent polypeptide substrates for productive interaction in vivo. Binding to membrane-coupled peptides occurred through the central peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) domain of TF, however, independently of prolyl residues. Crosslinking experiments showed that a TF fragment containing the PPIase domain linked to the ribosome via the N-terminal domain is sufficient for interaction with nascent polypeptide substrates. Homology modeling of the PPIase domain revealed a conserved FKBP(FK 506 -binding protein) -like binding pocket composed of exposed aromatic residues <b>embedded</b> in a <b>groove</b> with negative surface charge. The features of this groove complement well the determined substrate specificity of TF. Moreover, a mutation (E 178 V) in this putative substrate binding groove known to enhance PPIase activity also enhanced TF's association with a prolyl-free model peptide in solution and with nascent polypeptides. This result suggests that both prolyl-independent binding of peptide substrates and peptidyl-prolyl isomerization involve the same binding site...|$|R

A new design for an in-cylinder fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer (FFPI) pressure sensor suitable for automotive engines has been investigated experimentally. The FFPI sensor consists of a single mode fiber containing two internal mirrors which form the cavity for the interferometer. To protect the FFPI sensor from the harsh environment of an internal combustion engine, the FFPI element is coated with metal. The sensing element is first dipped in liquid gold and cured in an oven.

40|$|Energy {{sources have}} been decisive in the {{development}} of human history. However, today abundant and inexpensive energy sources are declining. Fusion energy might contribute to overcome this problem. For instance, stellarators, which are magnetically confined fusion devices whose magnetic field is mainly generated by external coils, are promising among the numerous fusion approaches. The advancement of the stellarator research line is hindered to some extent by their high geometrical complexity that results in long production cycles and high costs. This thesis investigates whether a manufacturing method, based partially on additive manufacturing, and fully integrated with the physics and engineering design, may speed up and lower the construction costs of certain stellarators. If such a method were feasible, a faster production cycle for experimental stellarators might also advance fusion plasma science. A research methodology that is essentially exploratory and applied is followed. Initially, concepts for new construction methods, based on literature searches and author creativity, are formulated. Next, these concepts are experimentally validated or rejected. Moreover, the design and construction of a small stellarator with major radius of 0. 125 m (the UST_ 2) is attempted to integrate and validate the concepts. Generation of knowledge about the feasibility of the methods and know-how are pursued. Literature concerning fabrication methods used in W 7 -X, HSX, NCSX and other devices is reviewed, particularly the coil winding and positioning methods, coil frame and vacuum vessel fabrication, as well as the assembly of such components. In addition, the QPS, NCSX-like and three quasi-isodynamic stellarator magnetic configurations are assessed using the CASTELL code. CASTELL is a code developed by the author to calculate, among others, guiding centre orbits and to interact with the NESCOIL code to generate coil configurations. After completing the literature review, fabrication methods have been studied, combined and some are tested. Subsequently, three main engineering concepts are formulated: i) additive manufacturing combined with casting, consisting of an additively manufactured light truss structure enclosed within a thin external surface, where the internal volume is filled with a material that solidifies or cures after filling, ii) coil frame, fabricated following the previous concept, that includes grooves in the external surface in which conductors are wound, and iii) a single conductor pancake compressed and <b>embedded</b> in each <b>groove.</b> Several results are reported. A construction method for stellarators based on additive manufacturing and resin casting has been conceived, developed and tested. However, the measured dimensional errors are ± 0. 3 %, which are excessive. Nonetheless, using high-quality 3 D printers and enhanced procedures may improve accuracy. The light truss structure concept has been designed, 3 D printed in polyamide and satisfactorily validated. Thus, the rapid manufacture of strong, geometrically complex structures at relatively low cost has been proven. The method combines a small quantity of expensive, but weak, 3 D-printing material with bulk inexpensive, but strong, cast resin, which can be fibre reinforced. It is considered that this concept could be extended to a 3 D printed metallic shell and internal metal casting. A Last Closed Flux Surface that includes a straight non-torsion plasma section has been calculated for UST_ 2. For that, a three-period quasi-isodynamic magnetic configuration was modified so as to allow possible enhanced engineering and maintenance features such as large planar tilting coils and detachable sectors. However, confinement is deteriorated. A convoluted sector of the vacuum vessel for the UST_ 2 has been devised, designed and fabricated as a copper liner that is externally reinforced by cast epoxy resin. Winding the cables in the grooves was straightforward and accurate. Coil frame positioning, envisaged as coil frames sliding on a flat smooth surface until contact on a mandatory circular central ring, was demonstrated by UST_ 2 half-period assembly. Finally, electron beam field line mapping experiments were undertaken in one half-period and confirmed the correctness of the explored methods. An affirmative answer results for the posed question. At least one faster construction method, with reduced costs, has been identified for a small stellarator. It can be considered a modest, but relevant, contribution to the broader fusion device construction problems and to fusion energy.
