40|$|ABSTRACT: Results {{based on}} ab initio density {{functional}} calculations indicate that cubic <b>diamond,</b> <b>boron</b> nitride, {{and many other}} cubic structures including rocksalt share a general graphitization tendency in ultrathin films terminated by close-packed (111) surfaces. Whereas such compounds often show an energy preference for cubic rather than layered atomic arrangements in the bulk, the surface energy of layered systems is commonly {{lower than that of}} their cubic counterparts. We determine the critical slab thickness for a range of systems, below which a spontaneous conversion from a cubic to a layered graphitic structure occurs, driven by surface energy reduction in surface-dominated structures...|$|E

40|$|We have {{performed}} soft X-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SXARPES) of microwave plasma-assisted {{chemical vapor deposition}} diamond films with different B concentrations in order to study {{the origin of the}} metallic behavior of superconducting diamond. SXARPES results clearly show valence band dispersions with a bandwidth of ~ 23 eV and with a top of the valence band at gamma point in the Brillouin zone, which are consistent with the calculated valence band dispersions of pure <b>diamond.</b> <b>Boron</b> concentration-dependent band dispersions near the Fermi level (EF) exhibit a systematic shift of EF, indicating depopulation of electrons due to hole doping.

40|$|The {{tetrahedral}} carbon (ta-C) and boron doped {{amorphous carbon}} (a-C:B) thin films have been grown by pulsed laser deposition. The respective effects of diamond percentages by {{weight in the}} target (Dwt%) and boron percentages by weight in the camphoric carbon target (Bwt%), on the tetrahedral (sp 3) and trihedral (sp 2) bonding properties are discussed. The optical gap Eg and electrical resistivity ρ increase with Dwt%, up to 1. 6 eV and 5. 63 × 107 Ω cm respectively, for the film deposited using target with 50 Dwt%. We found that the Dwt% has modified the sp 3 bonds content and the morphology of the carbon films. On the other hand, the Eg of a-C:B films is almost unchanged at about 0. 95 eV up to 10 Bwt% and decreases thereafter to 0. 6 eV at 16 Bwt%. The ρ increases initially to 2. 29 × 106 Ω cm at 2 Bwt%, and decreases thereafter up to 4. 58 × 105 and 1. 82 × 104 Ω cm at 10 and 16 Bwt%, respectively. The variation of structural properties, Eg and ρ, {{can be related to}} the successful doping of B in the a-C films at low content of Bwt% (up to 10 Bwt%), as the structural properties and Eg remain almost unchanged and the ρ decreased. Since both Eg and ρ decreased sharply with higher Bwt%, this phenomenon can be related to graphitization. In this paper, the dependence of sp 3 and sp 2 impurity content on the growth and growth conditions of the films are also studied.

40|$|A set of {{materials}} property data for potential wear resistant materials was collected. These materials are designated {{for use as}} the ''core'' materials in the Fibrous Monolith structure. The material properties of hardness, toughness, thermal conductivity and cost were selected as determining factors for material choice. Data for these four properties were normalized, and weighting factors were assigned for each property to establish priority and evaluate the effects of priority fluctuation. Materials were then given a score based on the normalized parameters and weighting values. Using the initial estimates for parameter priority, the highest ranking material was tungsten carbide, with diamond as the second ranked material. Several materials {{were included in the}} trade study, and five were selected as promising ''core'' materials to include in this effort. These materials are tungsten carbide, <b>diamond,</b> <b>boron</b> carbide, titanium diboride and silicon carbide. Work was initiated on a trade study to evaluate ''shell'' materials.

Kyocera Industrial Ceramics in Kyoto, Japan was visited, with the purpose of negotiating and signing the subcontract for Kyocera's participation on this program.

500|$|Nitrogen {{is by far}} {{the most}} common {{impurity}} found in gem diamonds and is responsible for the yellow and brown color in <b>diamonds.</b> <b>Boron</b> is responsible for the blue color. Color in diamond has two additional sources: irradiation (usually by alpha particles), that causes the color in green diamonds, and plastic deformation of the diamond crystal lattice. Plastic deformation is the cause of color in some brown and perhaps pink and red diamonds. In order of increasing rarity, yellow diamond is followed by brown, colorless, then by blue, green, black, pink, orange, purple, and red. [...] "Black", or Carbonado, diamonds are not truly black, but rather contain numerous dark inclusions that give the gems their dark appearance. Colored diamonds contain impurities or structural defects that cause the coloration, while pure or nearly pure diamonds are transparent and colorless. Most diamond impurities replace a carbon atom in the crystal lattice, known as a carbon flaw. The most common impurity, nitrogen, causes a slight to intense yellow coloration depending upon the type and concentration of nitrogen present. The Gemological Institute of America (GIA) classifies low saturation yellow and brown diamonds as diamonds in the normal color range, and applies a grading scale from [...] "D" [...] (colorless) to [...] "Z" [...] (light yellow). Diamonds of a different color, such as blue, are called fancy colored diamonds and fall under a different grading scale.|$|R

Superhard composites {{are normally}} made at high temperature and under high pressure around 5 GPa to avoid the phase transformation of <b>diamonds</b> or cubic <b>boron</b> nitride. This paper researched the synthesis of Ti 3 SiC 2 from the powders of Ti, Si, and graphite by a cubic presser under 1 GPa to 4 GPa at 1400 °C. The decomposition of Ti 3 SiC 2 under 5 GPa at 1400 °C was also researched. From X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results, Ti 3 SiC 2 was synthesized in 30 min under 1 GPa at 1400 °C. The impurities were TiSi 2, Ti 5 Si 3 Cx, and TiC. As the pressure increased from 1 GPa to 4 GPa, less Ti 3 SiC 2 more TiSi 2 was synthesized. Therefore, high presser> 1 GPa is unfavorable for the synthesis of Ti 3 SiC 2.
