5|$|The Yankees signed Núñez as an {{international}} free agent in 2004. He played minor league baseball in their organization from 2005 through 2010, until he made his MLB debut with the Yankees on August 19, 2010. He has served to allow <b>Derek</b> <b>Jeter</b> and Alex Rodriguez {{the ability to take}} days off in the field. Due to struggles and inconsistency, the Yankees designated Núñez for assignment {{at the start of the}} 2014 season. He was traded to the Twins, and enjoyed a breakout season in 2016, when he was named to appear in the MLB All-Star Game. He was traded to the Giants in 2016, and to the Red Sox in 2017.|$|E

5|$|George Steinbrenner {{bought the}} club in 1973 and {{regularly}} invested in new talent, using free agency to acquire top players. Yankee Stadium was renovated and reopened in 1976 {{as the home of}} a more competitive Yankees team. Despite clubhouse disputes, the team reached the World Series four times between 1976 and 1981 and claimed the championship in 1977 and 1978. New York continued to pursue their strategy of signing free agents into the 1980s, but with less success, and the team eventually sank into mediocrity after 1981. In the early 1990s, the team began to improve as their roster was rebuilt around young players from their minor league system, including <b>Derek</b> <b>Jeter</b> and Mariano Rivera. After earning a playoff berth in 1995, the Yankees won four of the next five World Series, and the 1998–2000 teams were the last in MLB to win three straight Series titles.|$|E
5|$|Nick Swisher {{opened the}} top of the fifth inning with a double and scored on a single to center field by Andy Pettitte. This was Pettitte's first career postseason RBI and the first RBI by a Yankees pitcher in a World Series since Jim Bouton in 1964. <b>Derek</b> <b>Jeter</b> {{followed}} Pettitte with another single, and both runners scored on a two-run double by Johnny Damon. Cole Hamels then walked Teixeira and was relieved by J.A. Happ. Happ closed out the fifth without allowing further scoring, but Nick Swisher added to the Yankees lead with a solo home run off of him in the sixth. Werth hit his second solo home run of the game leading off the bottom of the sixth to close the Yankees lead to 6–4, becoming the second Phillies player to hit multiple home runs in this World Series.|$|E
5|$|That year, the Red Sox won an eventful season {{series against}} the Yankees. A 13-inning {{comeback}} win for the Yankees on July 1 was punctuated by a catch from <b>Derek</b> <b>Jeter,</b> who ran and dove into the stands at full speed and came out with facial lacerations when Trot Nixon hit a pop up in an area deep behind third base. On July 24, Jason Varitek shoved his glove {{into the face of}} the Yankees' Álex Rodríguez after Rodríguez was hit by a pitch from Bronson Arroyo, causing a bench-clearing brawl. Though he was ejected (along with Rodríguez) from the game following the incident, the moment sparked Boston to an 11–10 come-from-behind victory. Both Rodríguez and Varitek were each suspended four games and fined $2,000 for the brawl.|$|E
50|$|After the 2005 season, Elarton {{was signed}} as a free agent by the Kansas City Royals. In 2006, Elarton gave up <b>Derek</b> <b>Jeter's</b> 2000th career hit. Elarton was shut down after 20 starts, {{finishing}} with a 4-9 record and a strikeout/walk ratio of 3.8 (49 strikeouts, 52 walks) in 114 innings.|$|R

50|$|Barnett {{was also}} {{behind the plate}} for Game 1 of the 1996 American League Championship Series, {{better known as the}} Jeffrey Maier game after the 11-year-old spectator who reached over the right field fence to catch <b>Derek</b> <b>Jeter's</b> fly ball. The play was ruled a home run by right field umpire Rich Garcia, who later {{admitted}} that the ruling was likely incorrect.|$|R
5|$|On July 9, 2011, Jeter {{recorded}} his 3,000th career hit, {{a home run}} off of David Price of the Tampa Bay Rays. Jeter finished the day with five hits in five at-bats, the second player to have five hits {{on the day he}} achieved his 3,000th hit (the first was Craig Biggio). He also became the second player to hit a home run for his 3,000th hit, Wade Boggs having done so in 1999. The last of Jeter's five hits proved to be the game-winning hit. He is {{the only member of the}} 3,000 hit club to record all of his hits with the New York Yankees, and the only player to join the club as a Yankee. Jeter became the second player to reach 3,000 career hits while still a regular shortstop (the first was Honus Wagner). Only Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron, and Robin Yount were younger than Jeter on the day of their 3,000th hit. MLB and HBO produced <b>Derek</b> <b>Jeter</b> 3K, a documentary that profiled his path to 3,000 hits and originally aired on July 28, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Once the 1999 season started, {{a moment}} of peace {{occurred}} between the fans. Yankees manager Joe Torre returned to Fenway Park for his first game following a battle with prostate cancer. While the managers were exchanging lineup cards, the Boston crowd gave Torre a long standing ovation, to which he tipped his cap. Good relations were seen during the All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Yankee manager Joe Torre, manager for the American League team, replaced starting shortstop Nomar Garciaparra of the Red Sox with <b>Derek</b> <b>Jeter.</b> Garciaparra received a standing ovation from the fans after Jeter came in to replace him (they also embraced each other at this time). Later in the game, {{when he came to}} bat, Jeter gave Garciaparra a tribute by mimicking his batting stance. Nine years later, in a similar fashion, Red Sox manager Terry Francona managed the American League team at the All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium, in the stadium's final season.|$|E
5|$|The Houston Astros chose Nevin {{with the}} first overall pick in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft. Hal Newhouser, a scout for the Astros, had {{evaluated}} <b>Derek</b> <b>Jeter</b> extensively prior to the draft. Convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, Newhouser lobbied team management to select Jeter, and quit in protest over the Astros' decision to take Nevin instead. The Astros believed that Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract. Signing bonuses given to {{the best player in}} the draft were increasing rapidly. Todd Van Poppel, regarded by many at the time the first pick of the 1990 MLB draft, signed for $1.2 million, while the 1991 MLB draft's first pick, Brien Taylor, signed for $1.55 million after insisting he would otherwise enroll in college. Meanwhile, the Astros were unable to sign their first-round draft pick in 1991, John Burke, who insisted on a bonus of $500,000 as the sixth overall selection. Consequently, the Astros passed on Jeter in the draft.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the top of}} {{the seventh}} inning, Berkman's RBI double over the head of the Twins center fielder Denard Span once again took the lead for the Yankees. Like Joe Maddon did earlier in the Rangers-Rays game, Twins manager Ron Gardenhire argued about the 1-2 {{borderline}} pitch right before Berkman's double and got ejected. [...] Later <b>Derek</b> <b>Jeter's</b> RBI single scored Berkman and made the score 4-2.|$|R
50|$|Early in , the Yankees {{signed him}} as a free agent, but {{released}} him during spring training after Rivera took teammate <b>Derek</b> <b>Jeter's</b> glove and bat, and then sold them to a sports memorabilia dealer, reportedly for $2,500. After this became known, his teammates allegedly voted him off the team, and the Yankees released him. When the incident became public, Rivera apologized but criticized the team after being removed.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, a {{commercial}} for the Gatorade sports drink, known as [...] "The Winning Formula", portrayed an alternate version of The Catch, in which the ball bounced out of Clark's fingertips. Following the Gatorade logo, the real version was shown with Dwight Clark's completion. This is also done with <b>Derek</b> <b>Jeter's</b> [...] "flip play" [...] going wide of home plate and Michael Jordan's famous buzzer-beater against Cleveland going off the rim.|$|R
