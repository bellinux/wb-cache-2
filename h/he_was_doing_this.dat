25|$|Having {{passed his}} law {{examination}} in 1904, Urmuz was first appointed {{judge in the}} rural locality of Cocu (Răchițele), in Argeș County. It is probable that at around this stage (ca. 1908), he was committing to paper the first fragments in his collection Bizarre Pages, {{some of which were}} reportedly written during a family reunion in Cocu. According to Eliza Vorvoreanu, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> mainly to entertain his mother and sisters, but Urmuz also amused local potentates, one of whom even offered his daughter's hand in marriage (Urmuz refused). At the time, Mitică also discovered his passion for modern art: he was an admirer of primitivist sculptor Constantin Brâncuși, fascinated by his 1907 work The Wisdom of the Earth.|$|E
500|$|Voormann, a {{close friend}} of Harrison's since 1960, found the {{atmosphere}} at the sessions unpleasant; he later cited the heavy drug use typical of the LA music scene, in particular, but also the ex-Beatle's [...] "frame of mind when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> album". Keltner, who described his own friendship with Harrison as [...] "like brothers", has similarly spoken of Los Angeles as an unsuitable environment for Harrison during this period, while commenting that Arias [...] "came into the picture at just the right time, a crazy, dark time". With Voormann choosing to absent himself, Harrison played some of the album's bass parts himself, using either ARP or Moog synthesizer.|$|E

500|$|Tom Noonan, {{who played}} killer Francis Dollarhyde, {{initially}} researched other serial killers {{to study for}} the role, but was repulsed by it. He then decided to play the character with {{the sense that he}} felt he was doing right by his victims, not harming them. [...] "I wanted to feel this guy was doing the best he could", Noonan explained, [...] "that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> out of love". Noonan credits his casting to improvisation during his audition, recalling that he was reading lines alongside a young woman. During a reading of the scene featuring the torture of Freddy Lounds, Noonan noticed that the woman began to seem frightened, and deliberately tried to scare her more. He believed that this is what secured the role for him.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{recorded}} the basic track for [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)" [...] at A Studios in Hollywood between 21 April and 7 May. Harrison played 12-string acoustic guitar, {{with support from}} David Foster on piano, and sparse, floor tom-heavy drumming from Jim Keltner. Klaus Voormann, Harrison's regular bass player and a friend since the Beatles' Hamburg years, chose to not participate {{in many of the}} sessions for Extra Texture, later citing the abundance of cocaine and Harrison's [...] "frame of mind when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> album". Harrison overdubbed the song's bass part using an ARP synthesizer, while Gary Wright provided the ARP strings atmospherics, a sound that characterised his hit album The Dream Weaver around this time. In the description of author Andrew Grant Jackson, the song's opening synthesizer part [...] "wouldn't sound out of place in a '70s horror flick or a Death Wish sequel".|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Tarantino {{discussed}} an {{idea for}} a type of Spaghetti Western set in the United States' pre-Civil War Deep South. He called this type of film [...] "a southern", stating that he wanted [...] "to do movies that deal with America's horrible past with slavery and stuff but do them like spaghetti westerns, not like big issue movies. I want to do them like they're genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't feel they have the right to." [...] Tarantino later explained the genesis of the idea: [...] "I was writing a book about Sergio Corbucci when I came {{up with a way to}} tell the story.... I was writing about how his movies have this evil Wild West, a horrible Wild West. It was surreal, it dealt a lot with fascism. So I'm writing this whole piece on this, and I'm thinking: 'I don't really know if Sergio was thinking [...] while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this.</b> But I know I'm thinking it now.

500|$|In 1930, Birkett was {{involved}} in the so-called Blazing Car murder case. On 6 November 1930, two men returning home in Northampton noticed a bright light in the distance and saw a man come out of a ditch {{at the side of the}} road, glance back toward the light and say [...] "looks like somebody has had a bonfire". The two young men ran toward the light, saw it was a burning car and fetched a policeman. When the fires died away, a body was found inside the boot of a car with a face so charred it was impossible to determine the identity of the man; the numberplate of the car was intact, however, and traced to an Alfred Arthur Rouse. Rouse was arrested and appeared at Northampton Crown Court on 26 January 1931, charged with the murder of an unknown man. He was defended by Donald Finnemore, and the Crown was represented by Birkett and Richard Elwes. Rouse was damned by a series of events. When arrested, he made statements such as [...] "I'm very glad it's over" [...] and [...] "I'm responsible" [...] and that the car engine had been off at the time of the fire, ruling out the possibility of accidental ignition. When he appeared as a witness, the defendant claimed that after giving an unknown man a lift, he had found that he was running out of petrol and had asked the passenger to take the spare can in the car and fill up the fuel tank. While <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> Rouse testified that he went to the side of the road to urinate, and while there heard a large explosion. He said he saw a large flame and became convinced the petrol tank would explode. As such he ran away as fast as possible, at which point he ran into the two young men on the road.|$|E
2500|$|Harrison {{recorded}} [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies" [...] in Los Angeles, while {{immersed in}} the city's music-business scene – and with it, author Robert Rodriguez notes, [...] "LA's 1970s drug culture" [...] – during {{the spring and summer}} of 1975. Harrison's role as owner of A-distributed Dark Horse Records saw him overseeing projects there by new signings Attitudes, Stairsteps and Henry McCullough, as well as socialising in circles that he admitted to finding depressing. Harrison's friend since the Beatles' Hamburg years, German bassist Klaus Voormann, has spoken of the abundance of drugs at the sessions, particularly cocaine. He said of Harrison: [...] "I didn't like his frame of mind when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> album – I don't play on it too much." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 699BCE, Bel-ibni, who {{had proved}} untrustworthy or incompetent as king of Babylon, was {{replaced}} by Sennacherib's eldest son, Ashur-nadin-shumi. Marduk-apla-iddina continued his rebellion {{with the help of}} Elam, and in 694 Sennacherib took a fleet of Phoenician ships down the Tigris River to destroy the Elamite base on the shore of the Persian Gulf, but while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> the Elamites captured Ashur-nadin-shumi and put Nergal-ushezib, the son of Marduk-apla-iddina, on the throne of Babylon. [...] Nergal-ushezib was captured in 693BCE and taken to Nineveh, and Sennacherib attacked Elam again. The Elamite king fled to the mountains and Sennacherib plundered his kingdom, but when he withdrew the Elamites returned to Babylon and put another rebel leader, Mushezib-Marduk, on the Babylonian throne. Babylon eventually fell to the Assyrians in 689BCE after a lengthy siege, and Sennacherib {{put an end to the}} [...] "Babylonian problem" [...] by utterly destroying the city and even the mound on which it stood by diverting the water of the surrounding canals over the site. (In fact the problem had not been solved: in 612BCE a coalition of Babylonians and other enemies of Assyria sacked Nineveh, marking the end of the Assyrian empire).|$|E

2500|$|For a few rounds, Hall {{was showing}} his skill was paramount. [...] He scored first blood, {{which was an}} {{important}} occasion in bare-fist boxing; there were bets made on who would draw first blood. [...] But as the rounds went on, Donnelly's strength began to tell. [...] Hall would slip down onto his knee, without being in any danger. This was a tactic, because once he went down the round was over, he got a 30-second rest, and came back refreshed. [...] <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> just a bit too often for Donnelly's liking, and at one stage, Donnelly {{was just about to}} lash out when he was down, and his second shouted out an admonishment that Dan would lose the fight if he did so. [...] Eventually he did lose his temper, and as Hall slipped down yet again, Donnelly lashed out and hit him on the ear; the blood flowed. [...] That {{was the end of the}} round. [...] Hall refused to continue, saying he had been fouled, that Donnelly should be disqualified. [...] Donnelly fans voiced that no, Dan had definitely won, Hall didn't want to fight on, Donnelly was the champion. [...] The fight ended in some controversy, but to the Irish, he was the conquering hero.|$|E
2500|$|Cook's {{men and the}} British Marines {{were confronted}} on the beach by an elderly kahuna who {{approached}} them holding a coconut and chanting. They yelled at the priest to go away but he kept approaching them while singing the mele. When Cook and his men looked away from the old kahuna, they saw that the beach was now filled with thousands of Native Hawaiians. Cook yelled at Kalaniʻōpuʻu to get up but the ruler refused. As the townspeople began to gather around them, Cook and his men began {{to back away from}} the crowd and raise their guns. The two chiefs and Kānekapōlei shielded the aliʻi nui as Cook tried to force him to his feet. Kanaʻina approached Cook, who reacted by striking the chief with the broad side of his sword. Kanaʻina instantly grabbed Cook and lifted the man. Some accounts state that Kanaʻina did not intend to hit Cook while other descriptions say the chief struck the navigator across the head with his leiomano. Either way, Kanaʻina released Cook, who fell to the sand. As Cook tried to get up, the attendant, Nuaa fatally stabbed him with a metal dagger, ironically traded from Cook's ship during the same visit. According to John Ledyard, Cook fired the first shot in the skirmish and therefore was responsible for the circumstances that led to his death. [...] Ledyard describes the escalation in his journal: [...] "Cook attended to what this man said, and desired him to show him the Indian that had dared to attempt combat with him, {{and as soon as he}} was pointed out, Cook fired at him with a blank. The indian perceiving he received no damage from the fire rushed from without the crowd a second time, and threatened anyone who should oppose him. Cook perceiving this fired a ball, which entering the Indian's groin he fell and was drawn off by the rest. Cook perceiving the people determined to oppose his designs, and that he should not succeed without further bloodshed ordered the lieutenant of marines (Mr. Phillips) to withdraw his men and get them into the boats.....the instant they began to retreat, Cook was hit with a stone and perceiving the man who hove, shot him dead: the officers in the boats perceiving the guard retreating and hearing this third discharge ordered [...] the boats to fire.....Cook having at length reached the margin of the water between the fire of the boats waved with his hat to cease firing and come in, and while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> a chief from behind stabbed him with one of our iron daggers just under the shoulder blade, and passed quite through the body. Cook fell with his face in the water and immediately expired." [...] This caused a close quarters melee between the townspeople and Cook's companions. Four of the Royal Marines (Corporal James Thomas and Privates Theophilus Hinks, Thomas Fachett, and John Allen) were killed, and two were wounded. The remaining sailors and marines fired as they fled to their small boat and rowed back to their ship, injuring and killing dozens of Native Hawaiians on the beach, including possibly High Chief Kanaʻina. Cook's ships did not leave Kealakekua bay until February 22nd. They remained for another week to continue repair of the mast and collect better quality drinking water. [...] According to John Ledyard's journal's hundreds of natives were shot in a series of ongoing skirmishes. The ships cannon was used on several occasions among the natives and a large portion of Kireekakooa, the southern town in the bay, was burned.|$|E
