25|$|Prima Vera's fourth album The Best of Ebba, {{released}} in 1980, was a compilation album containing the band's greatest hits plus one new song. It {{did not make}} the charts. However, the band's fifth release, 1981's Prima Vera den 5'te provided more success, spurred on by another controversy. The original album cover had a superimposed image of Teigen, Falsk and Mathisen standing behind King Olav V, Crown Princess Sonja and Queen Elizabeth II. Even though the image itself was quite innocent, with no evidence that any member of Norway's royal family was ever offended by the picture, the band was forced to withdraw the album from the market, and re-release it with a different cover. Of course, Prima Vera milked this controversy <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> was worth, and the album peaked at #2 in the charts, spending 16 weeks in the Top 20.|$|E

Activities are also free to take place on streets and squares where people live, work, shop and play to make events more accessible for its residents. Its buildings and public transportation are designed with an attractive and inviting attitude in mind to create a more comfortable space. The City also values the importance of a “walkable” downtown as it allows its residents to enjoy buildings and services being in walking distance of each other. This space is pedestrian friendly, creating an accessible space for all. Overall, Markham aims to put its residents and their families first, bringing jobs closer into its boundaries and protecting the environment.|$|E
500|$|Santiago {{describes}} his guitar playing as [...] "angular and bent," [...] "all derived from guitar moments that perk my ears up". Notable in his style {{is how he}} uses distortion and feedback to leave spaces open. A good example is the intro of There Goes My Gun. He attributes much of his style to songs he enjoyed when first learning the guitar, such as The Beatles' [...] "Savoy Truffle", where [...] "George Harrison played that bent note that I {{fell in love with}} and later milked it <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> was worth." [...] He used such techniques with the Pixies: Doolittle's [...] "Dead" [...] begins with Santiago's guitar [...] "squawking" [...] on an E-flat like [...] "a wounded animal". As Santiago was learning the guitar, he saw himself as a self-conscious amateur, and still speaks of a lack of confidence in his playing.|$|E

He sent messages to the themes of Greece, whose support had been lukewarm until that point, demanding additional ships. The themes responded forcefully, sending their squadrons, allegedly numbering 350 vessels, to join him. Thus reinforced, Thomas decided to launch a two-pronged assault against Constantinople's sea walls, with his original fleet attacking {{the wall of the}} Golden Horn, and the new fleet attacking the south coast, looking towards the Sea of Marmara. Michael, however, did not remain idle: his own fleet attacked the thematic force soon after it arrived at its anchorage in Byrida. Using Greek fire, the Imperial Fleet destroyed many of the rebel vessels and captured most of the remaining ships. Only a few managed to escape and rejoin Thomas's forces.|$|E

It had a low budget for its time of £200,000 ($500,000) and filming was finished in under seven weeks. At first, the film itself was something of a secondary consideration to UA, whose primary interest was in being able to release the soundtrack album in the United States before Capitol Records (the American EMI affiliate who had first shot at releasing Beatles music in the States) got around to issuing their material; in the words of Bud Ornstein, the European head of production for United Artists: [...] "Our record division wants to get the soundtrack album to distribute in the States, and what we lose on the film we'll get back on this disc."

500|$|In {{addition}} to the controversies surrounding {{the early years of}} their career, the band has also drawn a fair amount of professional criticism in their home state. The Portland Mercury have been frequent detractors of the Daddies, deriding them as [...] "at best, an edgeless recycle of a rather particular musical fashion movement; at worst, a self-conscious parody of the genre they purport to love", while the Willamette Week, in an article detailing the band's polarizing reception, described the negative consensus of the Daddies as [...] "an annoying white-boy funk rock band who, seeing the opportunity, milked the swing revival <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> was worth". Jazz critic and author Scott Yanow vociferously criticized the band as the choice [...] "whipping boy for the Retro Swing movement" [...] in his 2000 book Swing!, writing them off as [...] "a punk rock band who has chosen to masquerade as Swing, at least until a better fad comes along", spotlighting the Daddies' [...] "mediocre" [...] rhythm section and profane lyricism as a case for making them [...] "a band to avoid".|$|E
500|$|Tokyo Mew Mew was {{generally}} well received by reviewers, who {{described it as}} cute and entertaining. Though AnimeFringe Patrick King notes {{that it is not}} a very intellectual series and that it avoids complex plot points, he lauded it as engrossing [...] "brain candy" [...] and an [...] "endearing action-romance" [...] that has no [...] "delusions of grandeur". Critics praised the artwork in both Tokyo Mew Mew and the sequel Tokyo Mew Mew à La Mode. Ikumi's [...] "free flowing" [...] style and character designs were seen as a perfect fit for the series. Criticism of Ikumi's art focused on images which regularly spilled out of panel borders and speech bubbles with ambiguous speakers. Patrick King of Animefringe stated: [...] "one of the most attractive aspects of Tokyo Mew Mew is easily Mia Ikumi's ultra-cute artwork. Big eyes, cat ears, fuzzy tails, and short skirts all come together in a cuteness combo that's hard to resist." [...] According to Carlo Santos of Anime News Network, [...] "Mia Ikumi's artwork is perfectly suited to the story, and it is not even all that wispy and frilly compared to other shōjo material. Like many budding manga artist, Ikumi's greatest strength is in carefully posed character portraits, and her prolific use of tones creates unique effects while also sidestepping the challenge of backgrounds." [...] Conversely, in writing for , Shaenon Garrity criticizes the series, calling it [...] "uninspired", [...] "insipid" [...] and [...] "creative bankrupt" [...] and feeling it was [...] "clearly designed by its publisher to ride the magical girl tsunami <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> was worth: the creators' marginal notes are filled with references to big book signings, photo shoots, and models hired to dress as the scantily clad preteen heroines." [...] She also remarks that the series makes poor use of its endangered species theme, while still having a [...] "preachy environmental theme".|$|E

2500|$|Baccara's {{fourth and}} final album (in the band's {{original}} incarnation) was Bad Boys, released in 1981. By this time the disco sound had been overshadowed by newer music movements (such as punk, new wave and synthpop) in much of Europe and interest was largely confined to those countries where the duo had an established fan base, notably Germany. The album was not released in the UK or US. Baccara have been (possibly unfairly) described as a [...] "one hit wonder" [...] in the UK, while they never achieved any recognition in the US despite some of their songs being given significant airplay.

2500|$|The appeal {{trial was}} held on 13 January 1931 at the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice, in London, and, it was hoped at the time, would settle the status of Lundy once and <b>for</b> <b>all.</b> <b>It</b> didn't – but it did show how utterly {{confused}} the situation was. In his defence, Mr Harman said he {{had every right to}} mint money, for Lundy, in his words, was [...] "a vest-pocket-size, self-governing dominion," [...] out of the realm for every practical purpose. The Lundy residents, he pointed out, never had paid any taxes to England and were liable to customs when they went there, for Lundy itself was a free port. The Attorney General, who was prosecuting Mr Harman, said that Lundy was surely a Utopia but that its inhabitants would be just as happy if the face of King George V, rather than of Mr Harman, were depicted on the place's currency. (Mr Harman's face was {{on the front of the}} coins, and that of a puffin on the back.

2500|$|Albertans are the lowest-taxed {{people in}} Canada, {{mostly because of}} the province's {{considerable}} oil and gas income {{as well as the}} more conservative financial philosophies of successive governments. [...] It is also the only province in Canada where there is no provincial sales tax. Unlike the other provinces, which use a progressive income tax regime, Alberta used a flat rate income tax (currently at 10%), while equal <b>for</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> also puts a higher burden of taxes on the lower-classes versus the upper-classes than found elsewhere. As a campaign promise, the New Democratic Party implemented a progressive system in 2015 after their electoral success. Alberta is one of few provinces that consistently has not received equalization payments from the federal government since 1962 (the others being British Columbia and (until 2008) Ontario, the original benchmark provinces). Alberta is now the largest net contributor to the program, which is intended to ensure that all provinces are able to provide similar levels of public services. [...] The province's wealth is largely due to the abundance of natural resources, and the provincial government's generous policies toward oil and wood pulp companies, etc. that have harvested the natural resources for export markets at a very high rate. As a result, Alberta is the only province in Canada that has (recently) eliminated its provincial debt.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, KYW-TV rebranded {{itself as}} KYW 3 after being known on-air as simply [...] "channel 3" [...] {{for most of}} its history (except for the Direct Connection era, when it was known as 3 <b>For</b> <b>All).</b> <b>It</b> also {{abandoned}} the longstanding Eyewitness News name after 26 years and experimented with giving each newscast a different name. The morning and noon news became Newsday, the 6 p.m. news as Newsbeat, and the 11 p.m. news as The News Tonight. It also started using a theme based on the five-note musical sounder of its radio sister, one of the top all-news stations in the country and the highest-rated radio station in Philadelphia {{for most of the last}} 40 years; indeed, their news director during this era was previously at KYW radio. Group W hoped to gain the trust of viewers who already associated KYW radio with high-quality news. However, neither of these fixes worked--mainly because of putting unknown anchors Bruce Hamilton (who had previously anchored in Orlando at WESH and WCPX, and after his stint here, returned to Florida at Jacksonville's WJXX and WJXT) and Jennifer Ward (previously of Toronto's CFTO-9) at the helm of the evening newscasts, while the more familiar personalities were relegated to weekends and mornings, and channel 3 stayed in the ratings basement. The experiment with different newscast names ended after almost three years in 1994, just before it became a CBS station, when the station began calling its newscasts KYW News 3, with familiar Philadelphia anchors Larry Kane (from rival WCAU-TV) and Stephanie Stahl (from Miami's WSVN) coming on board; Kane anchored the 11 p.m. broadcast solo, while Stahl anchored the 6PM report, first with Bruce Hamilton, then with Pittsburgh's Don Cannon (though due to potential confusion with a local radio DJ also named Don Cannon, he went under his birth name of Don Clark while at KYW; he left in 1998 for sister KDKA). The Eyewitness News name was restored in early 1998.|$|E
