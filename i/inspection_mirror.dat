The scientific objectives of the ExoMars rover are designed to answer several key questions {{in the search for}} life on Mars. In particular, the unique subsurface drill will address some of these, such as the possible existence and stability of subsurface organics. PanCam will establish the surface geological and morphological context for the mission, working in collaboration with other context instruments. Here, we describe the PanCam scientific objectives in geology, atmospheric science, and 3 -D vision. We discuss the design of PanCam, which includes a stereo pair of Wide Angle Cameras (WACs), each of which has an 11 -position filter wheel and a High Resolution Camera (HRC) for high-resolution investigations of rock texture at a distance. The cameras and electronics are housed in an optical bench that provides the mechanical interface to the rover mast and a planetary protection barrier. The electronic interface is via the PanCam Interface Unit (PIU), and power conditioning is via a DC-DC converter. PanCam also includes a calibration target mounted on the rover deck for radiometric calibration, fiducial markers for geometric calibration, and a rover <b>inspection</b> <b>mirror.</b> Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} {{incidence}} of ocular fundus disease in preschool children examined by non-mydriatic fundus camera and evaluate its effectiveness compared with direct <b>inspection</b> shadow <b>mirror.</b> METHODS: Three thousand eight hundred and ninety-six preschool children from April 2012 to October 2013 were examined by Topcon TRC-NW 300 color fluorescence fundus camera and direct <b>inspection</b> shadow <b>mirror,</b> and images were saved immediately. RESULTS: Detection rate of non-mydriatic fundus photography was {{higher than that of}} direct <b>inspection</b> shadow <b>mirror.</b> In 3 896 cases, 41 eyes were detected abnormal fundus accounting for 1. 05 %. The retinal myelinated nerve fibers, morning glory syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, congenital retinoschisis were common, accounted for 24. 39 %, 21. 95 %, 14. 63 %, 12. 20 % respectively. The children eye diseases were often accompanied by abnormal vision(68. 30 %), ametropia(63. 41 %), strabismus(19. 51 %). CONCLUSION: Non-mydriatic fundus photography is a mydriatic method without medicine, so it is easy for preschool children to accept. Image results could directly display the fundus lesions. It shows important significance in the screening for preschool children eye diseases...|$|R
40|$|As {{the threat}} of {{terrorism}} becomes more prevalent, the need for technological innovations for tighter security rises. Some of the areas where security needs to be increased are at border customs stations, airports, federal buildings, embassies, sporting events, and the like where checkpoints are being set up to inspect vehicles coming onto the premises. The proposed vehicle inspection system uses an array of cameras and mosaicing techniques to generate different perspective views that provide a 3 D representation of a vehicle’s undercarriage. These mosaics allow a complete inspection of the undercarriage using a graphical user interface without requiring the use of <b>inspection</b> <b>mirrors</b> or the vehicle to drive over a manned inspection bay. The system is designed for simplicity so that operators will not require long training periods...|$|R

5|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the party discipline <b>inspection</b> system <b>mirrors</b> that of the MOS, with the CCDI responsible for cases involving breaches of party discipline and state law by party members. Like the MOS, the CCDI lacks judicial authority and is limited to investigating allegations of corruption and breaches of party discipline. Since the CCDI {{does not have the}} power to prosecute, it is supposed to transfer cases (after investigation) to the Supreme People's Procuratorate or the Supreme People's Court. Despite this, its formal jurisdiction is loosely defined. The CDI's ability to begin investigations and administer party sanctions has often led to the slow transfer (or sometimes no transfer) of cases to the Supreme People's Procuratorate.|$|R

From the late 1970s, the East Germans also installed concealed gamma-ray detectors ("gamma guns") at border crossings which used radioactive caesium-137 sources to detect people concealed inside vehicles. The discovery of this practice caused a health scare after reunification.

5000|$|Studies {{have been}} done mainly on {{primates}} to test if self-awareness is present. Apes, monkeys, elephants, and dolphins have been studied most frequently. The most relevant studies to this day that represent self-awareness in animals {{have been done}} on chimpanzees, dolphins, and magpies. Self-awareness in animals is tested through mirror self recognition. Animals who show mirror self recognition go through four stages 1) social response, 2) physical <b>mirror</b> <b>inspection,</b> 3) repetitive <b>mirror</b> testing behavior, and 4) the mark test; which involves the animals spontaneously touching a mark on their body {{which would have been}} difficult to see without the mirror.The ‘Red Spot Technique’ created and experimented by Gordon Gallup studies self-awareness in animals (primates). Toivanen says on a study done on perceptual self-awareness, [...] "The attribution of self-perception to animals is based on a distinction between the experiential awareness of the soul and the intellectual understanding of its essence, a distinction postulated." [...] In this technique, a red odorless spot is placed on an anesthetized primate's forehead. The spot is placed on the forehead so that it can only be seen through a mirror. Once the individual awakens, independent movements toward the spot after seeing their reflection in a mirror are observed. During the Red Spot Technique, after looking in the mirror, chimpanzees used their fingers to touch the red dot that was on their forehead and,after touching the red dot they would even smell their fingertips. [...] "Animals that can recognize themselves in mirrors can conceive of themselves," [...] says Gallup. Another prime example are elephants. Three elephants were exposed to large mirrors where experimenters studied the reaction when the elephants saw their reflection. These elephants were given the [...] "litmus mark test" [...] in order to see whether they were aware of what they were looking at. This visible mark was applied on the elephants and the researchers reported a large progress with self-awareness. The elephants shared this success rate with other animals such as monkeys and dolphins.|$|R

40|$|Eye {{fixations}} {{were recorded}} while novice and experienced drivers drove along {{three types of}} roads (rural, suburban and dual-carriageway).

Single-fixation, two-fixation, and three-fixation patterns of eye-movements were identified. Differences in sequences of fixations were found between novice and experienced drivers on the three types of roads, with experienced drivers showing greater sensitivity overall, and with some stereotypical transitions in the visual attention of the novices.

40|$|Mirror Self-Recognition (MSR) unveils complex cognitive, {{social and}} {{emotional}} skills {{and it has been}} found only in humans and few other species, such as great apes, dolphins, elephants and magpies. In this pilot study, we tested if horses show the capacity of MSR. Four subjects living socially under naturalistic conditions were selected for the experiment. We adopted the classical mark test, which consists in placing a coloured mark on an out-of-view body part, visible only through <b>mirror</b> <b>inspection.</b> If the animal considers the image as its own, it will use its reflection to detect the mark and will try to explore it. We enhanced the classical paradigm by introducing a double-check control. Only {{in the presence of the}} reflecting surface, animals performed tactile and olfactory exploration of the mirror and looked behind it. These behaviors suggest that subjects were trying to associate multiple sensory cues (visual, tactile and olfactory) to the image in the mirror. The lack of correspondence between the collected stimuli in front of the mirror and the response to the colored mark lead us to affirm that horses are able to perceive that the reflected image is incongruent when compared with the memorized information of a real horse. However, without replication of data, the self-directed behavior towards the colored marks showed by our horses cannot be sufficient per se to affirm that horses are capable of self-recognition...|$|R
40|$|As an {{introduction}} to the style and format of this research report, I feel that a foreword would serve useful to the reader. The name of the research, the development of self of therapist in therapy training was carefully considered to represent the feel of this research report. When one considers a looking glass, better known today as a mirror, a couple of processes happen simultaneously. A mirror provides us with a superficial indication of who we are. The phrase shattered assumptions comes directly from this metaphor; we are whom we see ourselves as. A mirror, to work, needs to provide us with a reflection. For {{us to be able to}} develop assumptions about ourselves, we need to see our image reflected within the mirror. For us to look closely at ourselves, to see our hidden flaws and faults, we need to move up close to the mirror, and really look closely and intently into that mirror. And what we see, is no more than a reflection of ourselves- but it is us, the us that others in the world see us as. This research report is an analysis. It is a close <b>inspection</b> into the <b>mirror</b> of the development of self in therapy training, but more than analysis, the artefacts presented in this report, are a mirror. And within that mirror, within this research, a reflection is occurring, a reflection of me, of me on my path to development of self-of-therapist. Mrs. H. Dunbar-Krige Dr. E. Frit...|$|R
40|$|Road crashes are {{the main}} cause of death of young people in the {{developed}} world. The reasons that cause traffic crashes are numerous; however, most researchers agree that a lack of driving experience {{is one of the major}} contributing factors. In addition it has been demonstrated that environmental factors such as driving during night and rain increases the risk of a crash. Both of these factors may be related to drivers’ visual search strategies that become more efficient with increased experience. In the present study we recorded the eye movements of driving instructors and learner drivers while they drove three virtual routes that included day, night and rain routes in a driving simulator. The results showed that driving instructors had an increased sampling rate, shorter processing time and broader scanning of the road than learner drivers. This broader scanning of the road could be possibly explained by the <b>mirror</b> <b>inspection</b> pattern which revealed that driving instructors fixated more on the side mirrors than learner drivers. Also it was found that poor visibility conditions, especially rain, decrease the effectiveness of drivers’ visual search. The lack of interaction between driving experience and visibility suggests that some aspects of visual search are affected by general rather than situation specific driving experience. The present findings support the effect of driving experience in modifying eye movement strategies. The high accident risk of night and rain driving could be partly explained by the decrement in visual search strategies during these conditions. Finally it is argued that the use of driving simulators can provide valuable insights regarding driving safety...|$|R
40|$|The {{contracted}} {{activities for the}} procurement of 'Investigate Zero-Stress Replicated Optics' to support the AXAF-S x-ray spectrometer mirrors has been completed. To date four large Wolter I grazing incidence x-ray optical shells have been electroformed from nickel. The mirrors were fabricated utilizing each of two nickel alloy plated aluminum substrates twice. A wide variety of testing has been completed by NASA MSFC and UAH. This testing includes heat treatment control tests, subscale plating and fixture testing, alloy control of the electroless nickel, adhesion and release testing of the gold to electroless nickel, electroforming instrumentation and software and fabrication of subscale models. The full scale shells are one millimeter thick nickel electrodeposited over a thin gold layer {{which in turn has}} the optical surface on the inside. The optical surface is the replicate of the surface prepared on the substrate. Appendix I briefly outlines the fabrication process. Major objectives which were shared by UAH and MSFC include the design of facilities, equipment and tooling and procurement of materials and equipment. Process development followed with the fabrication of small scale pilot units. Procurement commenced immediately and equipment and materials were ordered to implement the fabrication of first surface full scale substrates (mandrels) and the second surface electroformed optical components. All principal objectives have been achieved. <b>Inspection</b> of the <b>mirrors</b> in visible and x-ray modes validates that the required performance and the quality can be achieved by an electroforming replication process. A very distinct progressive improvement has been achieved with each of the four mirrors produced. The final mirror exceeded the original goals and set an improved standard for flight hardware. The future goal of a 30 arc second resolution at 8 KEV x-ray appears to be achievable by this process when proper cleanliness and process control is utilized...|$|R
30|$|Various {{interventions}} {{have been}} developed to help older drivers to self-regulate their driving behavior and thus maintain safe driving, such as self-assessment questionnaires and self-screening tools [26 – 31], educational interventions associated or not with practical driving training [32 – 41], and cognitive training programs [42 – 48]. Self-assessment questionnaires of cognitive, physical and sensory driving-related abilities and self-screening tools of driving-related difficulties have helped older drivers to i) become aware of age-related changes that could affect their driving, ii) initiate discussion with family on driving cessation, and iii) self-regulate their driving behavior [26 – 31]. However, further investigations should be conducted to find out whether these self-declared behavioral changes are actually implemented during real driving. Among the other interventions developed, educational interventions were performed with an occupational therapist who: i) reminds older drivers of driving rules, ii) gives recommendations for safer driving, and, iii) gives information about age-related driving difficulties [32 – 38]. Although these educational interventions have initiated changes in driving habits and behavior [32, 34, 35, 37], they had no effect on on-road driving performance [38], and were not associated with crash rate reduction [33, 36]. Furthermore, if they are not conducted by professionals accustomed to referring also to positive aging effects, this type of intervention could have an effect opposite to that expected and thus activate the stereotype threat in older adults [49]. This psychological concept reflects the confirmation of a negative stereotype of a group to which the person belongs [50]. This stereotype has a negative effect on driving-related cognitive performances [51] and driving performances [52] and hinders older drivers from correctly self-regulating their driving [53]. Educational interventions associated with practical driving training (performed on-road or with a driving simulator) improve older drivers’ knowledge of traffic rules and road safety [39, 41], and also reveal transfer to on-road driving of skills acquired on a simulator (i.e. increased visual <b>inspections</b> in <b>mirrors</b> and blind spots before lane changing) [40]. Several studies have also investigated the benefits of cognitive training programs in terms of older drivers’ driving performances. Even though cognitive training focused on speed of processing and visual attention improves these cognitive abilities relevant to driving safety [42, 43, 45, 48], contradictory results have been reported regarding the beneficial effects of cognitive training on simulated or on-road driving performance [42 – 44, 46, 47]. One study showed a reduction in dangerous maneuvers on the road [42] and another showed improved braking reaction time on a driving simulator [46]. However, other studies showed no improvement of driving performances after cognitive training [43, 44, 47]. Hence, the effectiveness of cognitive training programs needs to be confirmed in on-road studies. Discrepancies in the benefits of cognitive training in terms of on-road performance {{may be due to the}} different levels of self-awareness of older drivers. People who are aware of their own abilities may make better use of adapted strategies learnt during these programs, because self-regulation largely depends on drivers’ abilities to evaluate their own driving and is influenced by drivers’ abilities to have insight into their declining driving performance [25]. However, it is also necessary to understand whether people who are not conscious and aware of their own abilities could or could not take full advantage of the content of these programs. Our study is based on the hypothesis that older drivers’ training needs depend on the drivers’ self-assessment of their cognitive abilities, which also influences their driving behavior [4, 24, 25]. Kruger and Dunning (1999) showed that those who perform poorly in logical reasoning or grammar exercises vastly overestimate their abilities and have deficient metacognitive skills in comparison with their more skilled counterparts [54]. A correct self-assessment of cognitive abilities would lead well-calibrated people to adapt their behavior correctly, and consequently to self-regulate their driving activity correctly. Among the cognitive incorrect estimators, over-estimators (OEs) and under-estimators (UEs) can be described. OEs think that they have greater cognitive abilities than their same-aged peers, but they do not. UEs think that they have poorer cognitive abilities than their same-aged peers, but they do not. Thus, an intervention that aims to improve older drivers’ self-awareness of their cognitive abilities could allow both OEs and UEs to calibrate themselves better. The aim is, for OEs, reduced risk of injury exposure, and, for UEs, improved self-confidence and continued driving.|$|R
40|$|Mirror Self-Recognition (MSR) is an {{extremely}} rare capacity in the animal kingdom that reveals the emergence of complex cognitive capacities (de Waal 2008). So far, MSR has been reported only in humans, chimpanzees (Gallup, 1970), bottlenose dolphins (Reiss and Marino, 2001) and Asian elephants (Plotnik et al, 2006), all species characterized by a highly developed cognition. There is growing evidence that domestic horses posses high cognitive abilities, such as crossmodal individual recognition (Proops et al, 2009), triadic post-conflict reunion to maintain social homeostasis (Cozzi et al, 2010), complex communicative systems (Whatan and McComb, 2014), flexibility in problem-solving (Lovrovich et al, 2015), and long-term memory (Hanggi and Ingersoll, 2009). All these capacities make horses a good candidate to test the ability of MSR in a domestic species. Through a classical MSR experimental paradigm (de Waal 2008) we tested eight horses living in social groups under semi-natural conditions (from the Italian Horse Protection rescue centre). Animals showing MSR typically go through four stages (Plotnik et al, 2006) : (i) social response, (ii) physical <b>mirror</b> <b>inspection</b> (e. g., looking behind the mirror), (iii) repetitive mirror-testing behaviour (i. e., the beginning of mirror understanding), and (iv) selfdirected behaviour (i. e., recognition of the mirror image as self). The final stage, known as the “mark-test”, is verified when a subject spontaneously uses the mirror to check for a coloured artificial mark on its own body which it cannot perceive otherwise. The horses underwent through a three-phase “mark-test”: 1) with sham mark (transparent ultrasound water gel) positioned on both side at jaw level, 2) mark (yellow eye shadow mixed with ultrasound water gel) positioned on left side of jaw (with sham mark on the right), 3) mark (yellow eye shadow mixed with ultrasound water gel) positioned on right side of jaw (with sham mark on the left) The mirror was one 0. 5 -cm-thick pieces of 140 x 220 -cm plexiglass glue on wood. Each test lasted one hour, horses were tested once a day, in consecutive days {{and at the same}} time. Our preliminary result on 1 horse shows some changes in self-directed behaviours which can be attributed to presence of the coloured mark. Firstly, the presence of the coloured marked significantly increased the frequency of scratching {{on both sides of the}} muzzle (p < 0. 0001). The most intriguing result (p < 0. 0001) comes from the comparison of the scratching rates directed towards the coloured mark side (N = 41) and the sham mark side (N = 23). Under the control condition (i. e. sham mark on both sides) no statistical difference was found for the scratching rates directed to the muzzle sides (dx N = 8; sx N = 5). Although further analyses are needed to confirm these preliminary results, our finding opens new scenarios about the evolution of Mirror Self-Recognition. The capacity of horses to recognize themselves in a mirror may be the outcome of an evolutionary convergence process driven by the cognitive pressures imposed by a complex social system and maintained despite thousands years of domestication...|$|R
