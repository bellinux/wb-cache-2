2500|$|A {{new coach}} design {{featuring}} a lower floor, for easier loading, {{and a higher}} roof-line, giving better headroom for wheelchair users, was introduced in 2015. The first, Phylis, is painted lined brown and normally runs with the teak coaches. Two further coaches, Iris for the green set and Edith May for the teak/chocolate set, are under construction and will carry batteries in a compartment over one end bogie for coach lighting. As well as the wheelchair compartment, which has tip-up seats, each will have a guard's compartment with (<b>emergency)</b> <b>brake</b> <b>valve,</b> vacuum gauge, side ducket lookouts and a standard seating compartment. The guard's compartment has four seats and may be used by passengers {{when not in use}} by the guard ...|$|E
5000|$|In the USA, an {{emergency}} stop cord is not used. Any visible cord running {{within the body}} of a railway car would have been what was known as the [...] "communicating cord." [...] This was a method of signalling the engine operator (known in the US as the [...] "engineer"). Unlike other countries, it was never intended for use by passengers. It had its own code of signals, similar to engine whistle signals. Drivers receiving an unusual, or unidentifiable, communicating signal might stop the train, perhaps as a [...] "normal stop" [...] or an [...] "emergency application," [...] at his discretion. A long, continuous signal would usually prompt a driver to make {{an emergency}} stop. Emergency brake valves were (and still are) always located on the bulkheads (end walls), inside the body of the car next to its end doors. The <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> is covered by a metal or clear plastic shield labelled [...] "Emergency Only." [...] Sometimes there was also a communicating signal handle on the inside bulkhead, labelled [...] "signal." [...] Mistakenly identifying the communication cord as the emergency brake can lead to confusion about how emergency braking works on US trains. Once an <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> is opened, all of the air in the braking system, except those of the locomotive(s), which are equipped with brakes controlled separately from those of the cars, is evacuated ("dumped" [...] in US jargon), immediately placing the train cars' brakes into emergency, just as if there had been an uncoupling of cars (a [...] "separation"). No action is required (or even possible) {{on the part of the}} engineer. The train will stop, no matter what he/she does. There is no override. Once the train has stopped, the braking system will not recharge (pressurize) until the emergency valve has been closed. This means a member of the train crew must locate the open valve, and ascertain that there is no problem which would make it unsafe to release the brakes and proceed. Identification of the valve is possible by the sound of air escaping from it. In many cars (and practically all cars built post-WWII), the communicating cord was only located in the vestibule, unless the car was of such a type that it did not have a vestibule, such as a dining or lounge car. In newer Amtrak equipment, the air-operated communicating system was electrified, and operated by pressing a button located in the vestibule. The old communicating systems have been gradually supplanted by radios, although they were still required on US passenger equipment until relatively recently. The <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> continues to be located on the inside bulkhead, or in a consistent (standard) location specified by safety regulations.|$|E
5000|$|ACP (alarm chain pulling) also {{causes a}} small lever to be {{released}} near the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> (usually mounted near {{one end of the}} coach), which does not retract to its normal position even when the chain is released. This allows the driver (or guard) to find out in which coach the ACP actually occurred. When the coach is isolated, the lever needs to be manually reset. Until this is done, the lamp and buzzer in the locomotive cab are continuously activated. A circuit breaker controls the lamp and alarm bell in the locomotive cab; in cases where defective equipment causes the lamp and bell to go off, the driver can disable them by placing the MCB (miniature circuit breaker) in the [...] "Off" [...] position. Despite the obvious safety hazards, sometimes this is resorted to by drivers when driving trains through sections where spurious ACP incidents are very common.|$|E

50|$|Prior to this derailment, neither {{training}} nor procedures mandated {{the guard}} to exercise {{control over the}} speed of the train by using the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> pipe cock ("the tail"). Apart from the driver being considered to be the sole operator of the train, the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> pipe cock does not provide the same degree of control over the automatic brake as a proper <b>brake</b> <b>valve.</b> The consensus among train crews was that a sudden emergency application from the rear could cause a breakaway (Which is in fact not possible, as the brakes apply along the train uniformly, the cock does not in fact apply braking solely to the rear car), and there was some evidence from previous accidents to validate such an opinion, however these were not involving the modern multiple-unit train design of which the Tangara is an example.|$|R
50|$|The Learjet 25 utilize {{wheel brakes}} {{as the primary}} method for {{reducing}} speed after landing. The brake system utilizes hydraulic pressure for power boost. The <b>brake</b> <b>valves</b> are controlled via the rudder pedal toe brakes through mechanical linkages. Two shuttle valves in the pressure lines prevent fluid feedback between the pilot's and copilot's pedals. Four additional shuttle valves connect the pneumatic system to the <b>brake</b> system for <b>emergency</b> <b>braking.</b> An integral anti-skid system in installed to affect maximum braking efficiency. In order to minimize heat build-up in the brakes and reduce brake wear, pilots are advised to deploy the spoilers upon touchdown.|$|R
40|$|Railroad cars in coal {{service in}} the northeastern United States are often shopped for wheel defects such as slid flat, built up tread and spalling. Previous work found that these defects {{can be caused by}} wheel sliding after air {{pressure}} leaks through defective service and <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> portions into the brake cylinder. Another important factor in the creation of wheel defects from wheel sliding is the car’s empty braking ratio. If a car is excessively braked when empty, or has lost weight, there will be a greater chance for wheel sliding and damage. Wheel changeout data for different car classes were reviewed and several coal cars in the classes with the most wheel repairs were selected for detailed testing. The cars were given a complete air brake test, including a brake cylinder pressure test, and the brake system and wheels of each car was inspected. A static brake shoe force test was then conducted on each car {{in order to determine the}} current empty braking ratio, loaded braking ratio and hand braking ratio. A second set of static brake shoe force tests was also conducted using a new device that does not require removal of brake shoes and the results were compared to the first method. The potential use of the new brak...|$|E
2500|$|The {{compressor}} on {{the locomotive}} charges the main reservoir with air at [...] The train brakes are released by admitting {{air to the}} train pipe through the engineer's <b>brake</b> <b>valve.</b> A fully charged brake pipe is typically [...] for freight trains and [...] for passenger trains. The brakes are applied when the engineer moves the brake handle to the [...] "service" [...] position, which causes a reduction in pressure in the train pipe. In normal braking, the pressure in the train pipe does not reduce to zero. If it does fall to zero, (e.g., because of a broken <b>brake</b> hose) an <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> application will be made.|$|R

50|$|In trailers, {{this remote}} air-supply {{is in the}} form of a tank, which is charged {{whenever}} the <b>emergency</b> <b>brakes</b> are released via the red trailer-supply valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, this tank actually receives its air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs of the tractor; the air from both of these reservoirs is merged via a two-way check valve. The two-way check valve is a pneumatic device that has two inputs and one output; each input is connected to one these reservoirs. Only the air that is at the higher pressure is allowed to pass through to the check valve's output, which then passes through the tractor-protection valve, and then travels onward towards the trailer's air-tank and spring <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> via the red trailer-supply line (a.k.a., the emergency line); this releases the trailer's <b>emergency</b> <b>brakes</b> (a.k.a. spring <b>brakes).</b> The tractor-protection <b>valve</b> is a device that prevents air from being lost from the tractor's braking system in the event of the air-lines becoming separated or broken. The tractor's air-lines connect to the trailer's air-lines via metal connectors known as gladhands. The merged air from both reservoirs of the tractor prevents air-loss from only one tractor braking circuit from causing the trailer's spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location, such as in the middle of an intersection.|$|R

30|$|The main {{contribution}} of the proposed cooperative <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning system delivers drivers a braking warning signal earlier by DSRC communication. Via vehicle-to-vehicle communication, the <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning signal will be broadcast and the transmission time is much shorter than the human reaction time. Therefore, drivers behind can receive an immediate <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning while the front vehicle <b>emergency</b> <b>brakes.</b> Since the transmission time is much shorter than the human reaction time, the driver in car C can {{be aware of the}} <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> of car A before the driver in car B brakes and its braking light comes on, as shown in Figure  4. Consequently, the early warning mechanism is the concept of the proposed cooperative <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning system. Now that active safety applications have become mature, cooperative communication technology to achieve improved safety will be the future trend.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>brakes</b> do {{not stop}} very well, as the {{stopping}} force provided by the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> {{is less than half}} the force of normal braking and takes much longer to stop a vehicle. For vehicles with manual transmissions, the mechanical <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> is routinely used to assist in hill starts as this frees both feet for use on the accelerator and clutch pedals. Even an unskilled motorist can get started without rolling backwards. It is inadvisable to use rear wheel <b>emergency</b> <b>brakes</b> when the standard brakes are available, unless {{there is a problem with}} the front wheels such as a tire blowout or slippery conditions risking a loss of control. Using the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> while driving changes the traction balance between the front and rear of the vehicle, if over applied may lock the back wheels and skid the car into a handbrake turn. Handbrake turns are often used in street racing to initiate rear wheel drift.
