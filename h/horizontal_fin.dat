40|$|AbstractFatigue crack {{propagation}} on aircraft external fuel tank <b>horizontal</b> <b>fin</b> {{is one of}} the common phenomenon of structural failure. In the past, it was reported that the primary factor of the fatigue crack is the oscillatory vertical load acting on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>fin.</b> Furthermore, the previous studies have revealed that the most of oscillatory vertical load on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>fin</b> was due to the influence of vortex air flow induced by opening the speed brake. The main goal {{of this study is to}} evaluate the behaviour of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>fin</b> of external fuel tank related to oscillatory vertical load generated by speed brake. To achieve this objective, structural analysis based on Finite Element Method has conducted by utilizing the dynamic load history of speed brake.

With the fin's horizontal base at a uniform temperature of 40 Â± 0 Â· 1 Â° C above that of the ambient environment, the optimal fin separation [...] corresponding to the maximum rate of heat loss [...] is deduced. As the ratio of the shroud height above the vertical fins to the fin height decreases from unity to zero, this optimal value decreases by approximately 17 %. The frictional characteristics of the air flow through the fin array have also been studied in the Reynolds number range of 4 Â· 0 x 104 to 2 Â· 0 x 105. Large streamwise pressure drops and high heat-transfer rates resulted when the fins were closely spaced and no clearance gap was present above the vertical fins. In reasing the shroud clearance resulted in smaller overall pressure drops and decreasing heat-transfer rates from the heat exchanger. ...|$|E
40|$|Fin {{flickering}} {{was defined}} as rapid movements of the fins. The behavioral function of such movements is however not well established. Depending on the species investigated, they were considered as comfort movements (e. g. removal of minor irritations) or alarm for young. In the cichlid Etroplus maculatus they allow homogenous repartition of eggs on the substrate. We studied visual and acoustical behavior of five Ophthalmotilapia ventralis (two males and three females) reared in a 240 l tank. Pectoral fin flickering associated with sound production was often observed, especially from fish that established a territory. With {{the exception of the}} butterflish Chaetodon mutlicinctus and gouramis, this aspect of fin flickering is generally overlooked in teleosts. First observations support the fact that sounds (peak frequency and pulse duration: 562 ± 95 Hz and 14 ± 5 ms, respectively) are not emitted during all kinds of fin movements but mainly during some caudo-rostral <b>horizontal</b> <b>fin</b> sweeps. In-depth studies are however required to better characterize the movements and understand what morphological traits are responsible for the sound production.

Although aerodynamics of grid fin {{has been studied}} by many researchers, few considers the aeroelastic effects. In this paper, the static aeroelastic simulations are performed by the coupled viscous computational fluid dynamics with structural flexibility method in transonic and supersonic regimes. The developed coupling strategy including fluid–structure interpolation and volume mesh motion schemes is based on radial basis functions. Results are presented for a vertical and a horizontal grid fin mounted on a body. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>fin</b> {{results show that the}} deformed fin is swept backward and the axial force is increased. The deformations also induce the movement of center of pressure, causing the reduction and reversal in hinge moment for the transonic flow and the supersonic flow, respectively. For the vertical fin, the local effective incidences are increased due to the deformations so that the deformed normal force is greater than the original one. At high angles of attack, both the deformed and original normal forces experience a sudden reduction due to the interference of leeward separated vortices on the fin. Additionally, the increment in axial force is shown to correlate strongly with the increment in the square of normal force...|$|E

Their effectiveness can further be increased for building heating/cooling applications if used along with energy storage. However, achieving good heat transfer between energy storage material and air is still a challenge. Several studies have been made on improving the heat transfer by using thermal conductivity enhancers (TCEs). However, no study provides comprehensive analysis on their complex and non-stationary heat transfer characteristics. This paper focuses on the influences of thermal conductivity enhancers (TCEs) on heat transfer performance inside the phase change material (PCM) during the melting and solidification processes for solar chimney application. Four types of TCEs namely vertical fin (VF), <b>horizontal</b> <b>fin</b> (HF), honeycomb structure (HCS) and square cell structure (SCS) {{have been used in}} the study. The experimental results show that the VF, HF, HCS and SCS reduces the melting time by 8 %, 12 %, 14. 5 % and 16 %, respectively compared to the pure PCM sample. It is also being found that the VF and HF with the same volume fraction have different effects on the heat transfer inside the PCM during the melting process proving that the geometry and distribution of fins are very important for the heat transfer enhancement...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} is reported of the steady-state rates of heat transfer from {{an array of}} vertical rectangular uniform duralumin fins (constructed with various inter-fin spacings, heights and lengths, all of which remain constant for each system), protruding from a horizontal rectangular base, {{in the presence of}} a horizontal, almost adiabatic shroud, situated above the <b>horizontal</b> <b>fin</b> tips. For a constant fin-base temperature, optimal fin separations, corresponding to maximum heat-transfer rates, were determined for selected values of fin height, length and ratio of shroud clearance to fin height. Higher optimal inter-fin spacings ensued as either the fin height or the length was increased. Greater fin heights produced higher heat-transfer rates from the fin array, whereas increasing the fin length resulted in lower steady-state rates of heat dissipation per unit base area. The optimal fin separation, which ensued for each specified combination of fin height and length was in the range of 4 Â· 5 10 Â· 5 mm. Of all the arrangements tested, the fin array system with no shroud clearance above the vertical fins, always gave the best performance as a forced-convective heat-exchanger, with a fixed air-mass flow-rate across it. A single non-dimensional heat-transfer correlation, whichaccounts for the effects of varying all the geometrical parameters and operating conditions of the heat exchanger, was obtained. Significant changes in the ratio of the shroud clearance above the vertical fins to the fin protuberance from the base produced only marginal variations in the average Nusselt number. For a constant air-mass flow rate, large streamwise pressure losses and relatively high heat-transfer rates resulted when the fins were narrowly spaced and there was little or no clearance above the vertical fins. The frictional characteristics of the air flow around the fin-array, when experssed by the friction factor versus Reynolds number relationship, exhibited surprisingly little dependence upon the shroud clearance to fin-height ratio. ...|$|E

40|$|Heat is {{generated}} in spacecrafts due to air-condition system, electronic and electrical equipment, human beings, etc. The heat generated from these sources {{must be removed}} {{in order to maintain}} the spacecraft at the required temperatures. Heat rejection to outer space is the area of present work where radiation is the dominant single mode. Extended surfaces are advantageous for this situation for heat dissipation to outer space. To simulate conditions of outer space where convection is not present is difficult and costly. Hence convection cannot be excluded in the testing of space radiator. The present analysis includes convection and irradiation terms. The physical situation considered is a <b>horizontal</b> <b>fin</b> with a rectangular cross-section. One end of the fin is maintained at a constant elevated temperature, and the fin is short and the heat loss from the tip is negligible. Heat is transferred by conduction along the fin and dissipated from the surface via natural convection and radiation. The numerical solution is obtained for the present problem by developing an algorithm where the domain is discretized by Taylor series central difference scheme and have been solved by Jacobi method, which possesses the quality of exceptional accuracy with a few numbers of nodes. The algorithm is computed using FORTRAN Software with certain parameter value. This method of approach helps to estimate its performance under actual working conditions. A comparison is made to published results, and the agreement between the present and previous is very good. Results show that the total heat loss to ambient strongly effected by convection and radiation. In the absence of convection, the efficiency is decrease with the increasing of radiation parameter. It is also show that increasing of radiation parameter will increase the total heat transfer to ambient. Longitudinal heat conduction parameter will increase the amount of heat dissipated to ambient. Because of several limiting assumptions, the results would be used only for preliminary analysis and design particularly when a fin assembly is involved rather than an individual fin...|$|E
40|$|Grid fins (lattice fins) {{are used}} as a lifting and control surface for highly {{manoeuvrable}} missiles. Grid fins also find their applications for air-launched submunitions. The main advantages are its low hinge moment requirement and good high angle of attack performance characteristics. Two dimensional analysis {{has been carried out}} using linear and shock-expansion theo- ries. The results indicate that above certain depth-to-height ratio, (called critical depth-to-height ratio,) the local normal force becomes negative due to shock reflection from the opposite side. Hence, depth (chord) for grid fin cell should not exceed a critical value. A prediction method has been developed for the estimation of aerodynamic character- istics of grid fin-body combinations at supersonic Mach numbers based on shock-expansion theory. Body upwash theory has been used for the effect of body; method of images has been used for carry-over forces onto the body. Empirical relation has been used for the modelling of separated body vortices and their effect on the leeward side fins. The method has been validated with experimental results for three configurations. The comparison is good for individual fin characteristics as well as overall characteristics for all the cases at higher supersonic Mach numbers. For lower supersonic Mach numbers at higher angles of attack, the prediction deviates from experiment. The reason for the deviation is due to shock detachment and shock reflection from opposite side, which is not modelled in the present method. Vortex lattice method has been used for prediction of linear aerodynamic character- istics of grid-fins at subsonic Mach numbers. Empirical relation based on trends from available experimental data has been used for the non-linear effect. The method has been validated with experimental results for several configurations without and with control surface deflections. The predicted aerodynamic characteristics compare well with experimental results for all the cases and the difference is within 15 %. Based on the subsonic and supersonic analytical methods, a prediction code for the aerodynamic analysis of configuration with grid fins has been developed. Flow field computations inside isolated cells have been carried out using CFD code, PARAS- 3 D. Effects of depth-to-height ratio, web thickness, web leading edge angle and cell width-to-height ratio have been studied. Increase in thickness reduces the critical depth and increases the normal force. This increment in normal force is due to shock wave formation at the expansion side and its interaction with the opposite side. Effect of cell cross sectional shape has been studied using inviscid computation over isolated cells. Square, right triangular, equilateral triangular and hexagonal cross sections have been considered for this study. The normal force for square cell at zero roll is higher compared to 45 deg roll (diamond shape). Triangular cells show large variation in normal force with roll orientation due to large variation in projected area with roll angle. To compare the characteristics of different cross sectional cells, the normal force is normalised with respect to total internal web area. The comparison shows that the hexagonal cell gives maximum normal force and right triangular cell gives the minimum. Packaging efficiency of different cross sections is analysed by normalising the normal force with frontal area. The results show that triangular cells are preferred for packaging efficiency. Viscous flow computations over complete configuration have been carried out using FLUENT. GAMBIT has been used for geometry definition and grid generation. Hexahedral finite volumes are used to generate the grids including the nose region. Flow computations have been carried out at supersonic Mach numbers. To reduce the compu- tational time, Flow computations upto 0. 5 calibre ahead of grid fin have been carried out with body-alone configuration. Flow over the fin-body section has been computed sep- arately taking the inlet pressure condition from the body-alone computed results. This procedure has reduced the grid size to around 1 / 5 th and the computations converged faster due to imposition of converged solution at the pressure inlet. The computed results on the body show that the Flow separation occurs on the lee- ward side of the body and formation of separated vortices. The comparison of pressure distribution on the body with experiment is good. Flow computations over the fin-body section have been carried out at different Mach numbers and angles of attack. The computed normal force coefficient on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>fin</b> compares well with experimental data. Computations with fin deflection of - 15 deg have also been carried out and the computed results are within 10 % of the experimental data. Flow computations over another grid fin configuration have been carried out at dif- ferent roll angles. The comparison of individual fin force and overall normal force and pitching moment coefficients with experiment is good. The comparison demonstrates the capability of prediction methods as well as CFD in analysing aerodynamic performance of grid fin configurations...|$|E
