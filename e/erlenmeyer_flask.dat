25|$|One of the {{earliest}} blood banks was established by Frederic Durán-Jordà during the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Duran joined the Transfusion Service at the Barcelona Hospital {{at the start of}} the conflict, but the hospital was soon overwhelmed by the demand for blood and the paucity of available donors. With support from the Department of Health of the Spanish Republican Army, Duran established a blood bank for the use of wounded soldiers and civilians. The 300–400ml of extracted blood was mixed with 10% citrate solution in a modified Duran <b>Erlenmeyer</b> <b>flask.</b> The blood was stored in a sterile glass enclosed under pressure at 2°C. During 30 months of work, the Transfusion Service of Barcelona registered almost 30,000 donors, and processed 9,000 liters of blood.|$|E
500|$|While {{investigating}} the crime scene, Mulder finds an <b>Erlenmeyer</b> <b>flask</b> labeled [...] "Purity Control". Scully takes the flask to Georgetown University, where Dr. Anne Carpenter (Anne De Salvo) helps her analyze its contents. Meanwhile, Mulder heads to Berube's home and finds keys for a storage facility. Secare calls Berube's home office and Mulder answers, {{pretending to be}} Berube. Secare tells whom he believes to be Berube that he's been in the water for three days, and is hurt. Meanwhile, the Crew Cut Man eavesdrops on the conversation. Secare collapses due to blood loss before he can tell Mulder where he is. While he is driven away in an ambulance, a poisonous gas is emitted from Secare's body when the paramedics perform a needle decompression. Secare recovers and flees from the ambulance.|$|E
30|$|When {{the plants}} {{grew up to}} 5  weeks old, 1  g of rosette leaves was weight and put into <b>erlenmeyer</b> <b>flasks</b> wrapped with {{aluminum}} foil.

The solution using for measuring was back into <b>erlenmeyer</b> <b>flasks</b> every time. The absorbance measured after 24  h was as the total amount of chlorophylls. The calculation of chlorophyll content was based on the method previously (Lolle et al. 1998).|$|R

Another recurring joke {{is the use of}} fictional apparatus and materials used in the experiments—items such as the [...] "Besselheim plate" [...] pokes fun at real lab equipment, often named after their designers (e.g. Petri dish, <b>Erlenmeyer</b> <b>flask).</b> Pencils are always used to point at key elements of the experiments, as the 'scientists' do not speak: this is sometimes taken to ridiculous levels—pointing out pencils using a pencil; pointing at chocolates and then at a person to show they are a gift. [...] Also, the series repeatedly instructs viewers to keep a notebook, described as a [...] "copy book," [...] and to inscribe random and essentially worthless details of the lessons taking place with the spoken instruction to [...] "write this down in your copy book." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Erlenmeyer</b> <b>flasks</b> {{are also}} used in {{microbiology}} for the preparation of microbial cultures. <b>Erlenmeyer</b> <b>flasks</b> used in cell culture are sterilized and may feature vented closures to enhance gas exchange during incubation and shaking. The use of minimal liquid volumes, typically {{no more than one}} fifth of the total flask volume, and baffles molded into the flask's internal surface both serve to maximize gas transfer and promote chaotic mixing when the flasks are orbitally shaken. The oxygen transfer rate in <b>Erlenmeyer</b> <b>flasks</b> depends on the agitation speed, the liquid volume, and the shake-flask design. The shaking frequency has the most significant impact on oxygen transfer.|$|R

Although many laboratories have switched {{to one of the}} other nontreponemal tests for syphilis serology screening, the VDRL test remains the only approved procedure for testing spinal fluids of patients with possible neurosyphilis. We tested 25 -ml glass-stoppered, convex-bottomed <b>Erlenmeyer</b> <b>flasks</b> to determine if these could be used as appropriate substitutes. We tested 52 reactive sera and 54 nonreactive sera by using one reference antigen prepared in the traditional flat-bottomed bottles and five antigens prepared in the <b>Erlenmeyer</b> <b>flasks.</b> Results with all serum samples were comparable. We also tested two lots of a commercial antigen plus an additional lot of reference antigen. Again {{there was no difference in}} the reactivity of the antigens.
