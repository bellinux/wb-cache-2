5000|$|Violent {{language}} can stem from sexist language or language that exhibits sexism because language that falls in these categories {{is used to}} minimize, discredit, or put down a group, most times meaning women. Minimizing and discrediting a group is achieved when the language encourages isolation, ostracism, or oppression to thoughts or actions; {{all of which are}} ways that force is inflicted (emotionally or psychologically) in order to limit a group's scope of power and restrictions are placed on opportunity or free will. Groups that have the power to use language this way are institutions. Institutions include any form of normalized social system. School, family, work, and religion are all examples of institutions. <b>Institutional</b> <b>violence</b> can be overt or covert and is implemented as a systematic ideology of the given institution. Text from Deane W. Curtin and Robert Litke's book titled <b>Institutional</b> <b>Violence</b> presents an example of <b>institutional</b> <b>violence</b> in the following quote: [...] "If a firefighters public exam makes unjustified assumptions that only men can be firefighters, this is covert <b>institutional</b> <b>violence</b> (p. xii)". This example exemplifies how a normalized social system has the ability to suppress and marginalize a group of society.|$|E

When criteria examining different manifestations of violence were regressed on the discriminant function scores resulting from this comparison of leader types, it was found that attributes of ideological leadership influenced the amount of violence, and the occurrence of <b>institutional</b> and cultural <b>violence</b> — accounting for variance in <b>institutional</b> and cultural <b>violence</b> above and beyond characteristics of leaders, in general, found to contribute to violence.

Have misconceptions about the lives of women with disabilities contributed to exclusionary practices within the women’s movement? This article further submits that violence against women with disabilities assumes many forms, both individual and systemic. It explores several factors, among these how exclusion of disabled women from mainstream services, coupled with the lack of appropriate funding for their organisations, and the poverty lived by individual women with disabilities; renders more difficult the task of these organisations to respond to member needs.

40|$|<b>Institutional</b> <b>violence</b> {{presents}} significant {{challenges to}} the accomplishment of legitimate social order in prison. This systematic review examines the effect of psychoeducational programs on violent behaviour in prison. Comprehensive searches of the empirical research literature were conducted to identify randomized and non-randomized studies {{carried out in the}} last two decades (1996 – 2016) that compared psychoeducational programs with treatment as usual (TAU). The content of programs was analysed and classified. The design of the studies was subject to a risk of bias analysis and quality assessment. Violent behaviour in prison was measured by institutional reports, inmate self-reports, observer ratings, or using psychometrically-valid scales. We identified 21 separate studies with considerable variations in program quality and evaluation methodology. The majority of programs adopted a cognitive behavioural or social learning approach. There was limited evidence for the efficacy of these programs, although highly-structured programs showed the most promise. Programs that aimed to integrate their treatment ethos into the institutional regime and target specific criminogenic risks also produced evidence of effectiveness in reducing <b>institutional</b> <b>violence.</b> The current evidence base does not provide a clear answer to the ‘what works’ question in reducing <b>institutional</b> <b>violence.</b> However, there is evidence that some approaches are more successful than others and this should guide future program design and evaluation...|$|E
40|$|New {{explanations}} of cultural processes are sought, in part, because existing hypotheses {{are at odds}} with new wave contemporary empirical findings. Namely, a growing body of scholarship calls into question the "racial invariance" hypothesis proposed by Sampson and Wilson (1995), particularly as it applies to Latinos. Based on these findings, {{it stands to reason that}} culture, in addition to structure, may be a property of communities that helps to explain racial/ethnic involvement in crime. This article explores the link between <b>institutional</b> and community <b>violence,</b> and then compares traditional perspectives on the influence of culture on violence (e. g. Wolfgang and Ferracuti's subculture of violence) with newer, more dynamic conceptualizations of the cultural influence of <b>violence</b> in both <b>institutional</b> and community settings (e. g. Sampson and Bean's relational theory of culture). The authors consider how both <b>institutional</b> and community <b>violence</b> may be explained using a new cultural paradigm, which moves beyond traditional views of "culture as values" to a new relational theory of "culture in action". They present a model for understanding, and researching, culture that is based on the notion that value systems in institutions and neighborhoods influence one another. Offering examples from recent research on prison culture, they examine the key dimensions of this new cultural paradigm, which describes culture as "intersubjective, performative, cognitive, relational, and world-making". The authors conclude that further examination of the reciprocal relationship between institutional and community culture is needed before we can begin to consider the policy implications of the "culture in action" paradigm.

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} <b>institutional</b> <b>violence</b> in obstetrics and postpartum depression (PP depression) and the potential effect of race, age, and educational level in this outcome. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study about the health care conditions for the maternal and child population of the Federal District, Brazil, carried out in 2011. The study has used a probabilistic sample of 432 women, whose children were aged up to three months, stratified by clusters. Indicators of <b>institutional</b> <b>violence</b> and demographic characteristics {{have been used in}} a logistic regression model to estimate the probability of occurrence of postpartum depression. RESULTS The model has identified a high prevalence of postpartum depression, being it higher among non-white women and adolescent females, besides having a strong positive association between the several indicators of obstetric violence and postpartum depression. Positive interactions on a multiplicative scale have also been observed between: violence by negligence by health care professionals and race and age; physical violence from health care professionals and age; and, verbal violence from health care professionals and race. CONCLUSIONS The indicators adopted to reflect <b>institutional</b> <b>violence</b> in obstetric care are positively associated with postpartum depression, which calls for a reflection on the need to make the health care protocols adequate to the precepts of the Brazilian humanization of childbirth care policies and changes in the obstetric care model...|$|E
