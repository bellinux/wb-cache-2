25|$|World Day for Safety and <b>Health</b> <b>at</b> <b>Work</b> is a UN {{international}} {{day that}} is celebrated every 28 April. It {{is concerned about}} safe work and awareness of the dimensions and consequences of work-related accidents and diseases; to place {{occupational safety and health}} (OSH) on the international and national agendas; and to provide support to the national efforts for the improvement of national OSH systems and programmes in line with relevant international labour standards.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the Coalition {{government}} asked Black to {{work with}} David Frost, the Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, to compile another report on sickness absence. The study was sponsored jointly by the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and was entitled <b>Health</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> - an independent review of sickness absence. The work built on Black's 2008 report into sickness absence and explored largely the same themes.|$|E

In many EU countries, there is strong cooperation between employer and worker organisations (e.g. unions) to ensure good OSH performance as it is recognized this has benefits for both the worker (through maintenance of health) and the enterprise (through improved productivity and quality). In 1996, the European Agency for Safety and <b>Health</b> <b>at</b> <b>Work</b> was founded.|$|E

[...] For 2006 the ICFTU theme was Union workplaces: safer workplaces, focusing on a global ban on asbestos and increased awareness of HIV/AIDS. [...] During 2001 the ILO, part of the United Nations, recognised Workers' Memorial Day and declared it World Day for Safety and <b>Health</b> <b>at</b> <b>Work</b> and in 2002 the ILO announced that April 28 should be an official day in the United Nations system.|$|E

30|$|Risk {{assessment}} {{is a tool}} to help an organisation or a department prevent accidents and ill health from occurring [12]. The requirement for risk assessment was first legally introduced in 1992 with the Management of <b>Health</b> and Safety <b>at</b> <b>Work</b> Regulations [13], even though the concept was contained within the <b>Health</b> and Safety <b>at</b> <b>Work</b> Act 1974 [14].|$|R
2500|$|On an {{international}} scale, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) have begun focusing on labour environments {{in developing nations}} with projects such as Healthy Cities. Many of these developing countries are stuck in {{a situation in which}} their relative lack of resources to invest in OSH leads to increased costs due to work-related illnesses and accidents. As a 2007 Factsheet from the European Agency for Safety and <b>Health</b> <b>at</b> <b>Work</b> states: [...] "Countries with less developed OSH systems spend a far higher percentage of GDP on work-related injury and illness – taking resources away from more productive activities... The ILO estimates that work-related illness and accidents cost up to 10% of GDP in Latin America, compared with just 2.6% to 3.8% in the EU." [...] There is continued use of asbestos, a notorious hazard, in some developing countries. So asbestos-related disease is, sadly, expected to continue to be a significant problem well into the future.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first group}} of Directives create a range of {{individual}} rights in EU employment relationships. The Employment Information Directive 1991 requires that every employee (however defined by member state law) {{has the right to}} a written statement of their employment contract. While there is no wage regulation, the Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2003 requires that pension benefits are protected through a national insurance fund, that information is provided to beneficiaries, and minimum standards of governance are observed. Most member states go far beyond these requirements, particularly by requiring a vote for employees in who manages their money. Reflecting basic standards in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and ILO Conventions, the Working Time Directive 2003 requires a minimum of 4 weeks (totalling 28 days) paid holidays each year, a minimum of 20-minute paid rest breaks for 6-hour work shifts, limits on night work or time spent on dangerous work, and a maximum 48-hour working week unless a worker individually consents. The Parental Leave Directive 2010 creates a bare minimum of 4 months of unpaid leave for parents (mothers, fathers, or legal guardians) to care for children before they turn 8 years old, and the Pregnant Workers Directive 1992 creates a right for mothers to a minimum of 14 weeks' paid leave to care for children. Finally, the Safety and <b>Health</b> <b>at</b> <b>Work</b> Directive 1989 requires basic requirements to prevent and insure against workplace risks, with employee consultation and participation, and this is complemented by specialised Directives, ranging from work equipment to dangerous industries. In almost all cases, all member states go significantly beyond this minimum. The objective of transnational regulation is therefore to progressively raise the minimum floor in line with economic development. Second, equality was affirmed by the Court of Justice in Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG to be a general principle of EU law. Further to this, the Part-time Work Directive 1997, Fixed-term Work Directive 1999 and Temporary Agency Work Directive 2008 generally require that people who do not have ordinary full-time, permanent contracts are treated no less favourably than their colleagues. However, the scope of the protected worker is left to member state law, and the TAWD 2008 only applies to [...] "basic working conditions" [...] (mostly pay, working hours and participation rights) and enabled member states to have a qualifying period. The Race Equality Directive 2000, Equality Framework Directive 2000 and Equal Treatment Directive 2006 prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, disability, religion or belief, age, race and gender. As well as [...] "direct discrimination", there is a prohibition on [...] "indirect discrimination" [...] where employers apply a neutral rule to everybody, but this has a disproportionate impact on the protected group. The rules are not consolidated, and on gender pay potentially limited in not enabling a hypothetical comparator, or comparators in outsourced business. Equality rules do not yet apply to child care rights, which only give women substantial time off, and consequently hinder equality in men and women caring for children after birth, and pursuing their careers.|$|E
