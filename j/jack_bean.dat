5|$|Confusion reigned {{over just}} what {{experiments}} had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned {{two lines of}} genetically modified potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media {{was talking about a}} second line transformed with concanavalin A (ConA), a <b>Jack</b> <b>Bean</b> lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested. Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research and supported increased safety tests on genetically modified food. The press releases also said that the potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy. The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist Sir Robert May and Agricultural Minister Jack Cunningham to release statements to the media saying that the findings were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to the potato. Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Lead (Pb) {{is one of}} {{the main}} soil contaminants. It is also of {{difficult}} phytoremediation due to its low solubility and high retention on soil particles. EDTA application to soil is a strategy to increase heavy metal phytoextraction, but such chelants usually cause phytotoxicity and metal leaching side effects. Therefore, these research work objectives were to evaluate the effects of single (0. 5 g kg– 1) and split (0. 25 + 0. 25 g kg– 1) EDTA application on Pb uptake by <b>jack</b> <b>beans</b> (Canavalia ensiformis L.) as well as on Pb vertical movement in a Pb contaminated soil material. Two sets of experiments were carried out under greenhouse conditions: in the first one, plants were grown in 3 L-pots filled with a Pb-contaminated soil to evaluate Pb uptake by plants; for the second experiment, PVC-columns (42 cm height) were used to evaluate soil Pb leaching: the upper half-column (20 cm) was filled up with Pb-contaminated soil (1800 mg kg– 1) whereas the lower half-column (20 cm) was filled with clean soil. Ten 60 mm-rainfalls with a duration of five hours were simulated by dropping distilled water on the top of columns, and leachates were collected for chemical analysis. Plants did not show any visual Pb toxicity symptoms or reduction in dry matter yield. Nevertheless, Pb uptake by <b>jack</b> <b>beans</b> regarded as total plant Pb accumulation was higher in EDTA-treated plants. Vertical Pb movement was observed mostly for the single EDTA application.
