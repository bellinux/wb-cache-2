60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> {{and stood}} simmering. Miss Smith came forward and, with a smothered giggle, took the mate's arm and {{squeezed}} it.|$|E
60|$|The new-comer {{threw back}} his head, {{and a look}} that was half wonder, half {{enlightenment}} gleamed in the black depths of his imperious eyes. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and clenched 'his hands together. By {{the time}} Mr. Chase {{came into the}} room he was able to greet him with a {{stealthy}} wink. Mr. Chase, with a humorous twist of his mouth, winked back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, if the gineral an' {{company was}} sthopped somewhere beyond thot pass?" [...] queried Casey, shrewdly, as <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> pull at his pipe.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} help him to say that. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> inhalation, pressed his lips tightly together, and nodded at her to confirm his words.|$|R
60|$|He watched Little Brown Betty {{until she}} had filled his mug, and the froth ran over the top. Then <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> draught and began again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh" [...] said Mr. Chase. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "Oh, really!" [...] he said. [...] "I wouldn't 'ave {{thought it}} of you, Gussie. I wouldn't 'ave thought you'd have played it so low down. I'm {{surprised}} at you." ...|$|E
60|$|Rage had transfigured her. She {{scarcely}} {{heard her}} own words. They poured out senselessly, monotonously, one calling up another, {{as if from}} the lips of a Cassandra. Lawford sank back into bed, clutching the sheets with both lean hands. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and shut his mouth.|$|E
60|$|The {{two gentlemen}} turned {{and gazed at}} each other in stupefaction. Mr. Stokes was the first to recover, and, taking his dazed friend by the arm, led him gently away. At {{the end of the street}} <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> and, after a slight pause to collect his {{scattered}} energies, summed up the situation.|$|E
5000|$|Seán Mac Réamoinn (27 November 1921 [...] - [...] 17 January 2007) was an Irish {{journalist}} and broadcaster. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in Irish culture and language and religious affairs.|$|R
50|$|The cartoon {{begins as}} a coyote howls from a {{mountain}} top, under <b>a</b> full moon. <b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath as his body inflates to accommodate extra air and releases another howl.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> draught of the posset, {{and as he}} set it down {{he heard}} Lionel's step without. Then the door was flung open, and his brother stood on the {{threshold}} a moment at gaze.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> {{and then}} {{stepped out onto}} the gray, rubbled ground. After a minute he lit a {{cigarette}} and stood gazing around him. The landscape was dead. Nothing stirred. He could see for miles, endless ash and slag, ruins of buildings. A few trees without leaves or branches, only the trunks. Above him the eternal rolling clouds of gray, drifting between Terra and the sun.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{waiting for}} you there," [...] said Mrs. Chaffery. She held a dismal little oil lamp, and they descended a tenebrous spiral {{structure}} into an underground breakfast-room lit by gas that shone through a partially frosted globe with cut-glass stars. That descent had a distinctly depressing effect upon Lewisham. He went first. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> at the door. What on earth was Chaffery going to say? Not that he cared, of course.|$|E
60|$|He {{wondered}} why Gwen {{had gone to}} bed without her pet. She would want the silly thing. The strong feeling of affection for his children came over him, battling with something else. He sank in his chair, and gradually his baffled mind went dark. He sat, overcome with weariness and trouble, staring blankly into the space. His own stifling roused him. Straightening his shoulders, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> then relaxed again. After a while he rose, took the teddy-bear, and went slowly to bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{looks to}} me as if the animals used this trail when they wanted a drink," [...] was Luke's comment. [...] "That water looks pretty good to me," [...] and bending down, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> draught. [...] "It's fine," [...] he went on; [...] "try it!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{old man had}} <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> {{liking to}} Bradley {{on account of his}} oratory, and the {{possibilities}} of making him a Democratic leader had really taken possession of him. He had no son of his own, and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in young men of the stamp of Milton and Bradley.|$|R
50|$|In {{his later}} years, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> {{interest}} in {{the fate of the}} strange foundling Kaspar Hauser who had excited so much attention in Europe. He was the first to publish a critical summary of the ascertained facts, under the title of Kaspar Hauser, ein Beispiel eines Verbrechens am Seelenleben (1832).|$|R
60|$|For {{an instant}} he stood {{head to foot}} icily still, without the least feeling, or thought, or stir--staring into the looking-glass. Then an inconceivable {{drumming}} beat on his ear. A warm surge, like the onset of a wave, broke in him, flooding neck, face, forehead, even his hands with colour. He caught himself up and wheeled deliberately and completely round, his eyes darting to and fro, suddenly to fix themselves in a prolonged stare, while <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> caught back his self-possession and paused. Then he turned and once more confronted the changed strange face in the glass.|$|E
60|$|His head {{broke the}} surface and emerged into the chill {{darkness}} of the night. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of cold but very welcome air, and moving his arms gently under water, he swam quietly, not {{to the edge of}} the moat but to the chateau wall, close under which he thought he would be secure from observation. He found by good fortune a crevice between two stones; he did not see it, his fingers found it for him as they groped along that granite surface. He clung there a moment and pondered the situation. He heard voices above, and looking up he saw the glare of light through the opening he had battered.|$|E
60|$|As {{the bolts}} were drawn back <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> The warder as usual came in first, {{followed}} closely by the armed guard. As the latter entered, Stephen sprang upon him, and his hands closed upon the man’s throat with so fierce a grip that the musket fell instantly from the fellow’s hands. Without losing his grasp in the slightest Stephen whirled him round and threw him against the warder, whom the shock brought to the ground, Stephen hurling the already almost insensible soldier upon him. Seizing the musket he brought the butt end down upon the soldier’s head with a force amply sufficient to stun him; then he rolled him off the warder’s body and helped the latter to his feet.|$|E
50|$|In February 2007 a {{professorship}} in his honour {{was established}} at Berkeley called the Dean A. Richard Newton Memorial Professorship. This was established {{with funding from}} the EDA Consortium and other friends, colleagues and corporate partners of Richard Newton. The Professorship will specifically advance the field of synthetic biology, an emerging area in which <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest.|$|R
50|$|The {{last great}} scheme {{in which he}} was {{employed}} was the projected Great Eastern Northern Junction Railway Bill of 1860, (known familiarly as the ‘Coal line,’) which his good friend George Parker Bidder had placed in his hands, and in which <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest; but death cut him short whilst in the active discharge of his duties.|$|R
50|$|A heavy {{cigarette}} smoker, O'Keefe died of {{lung cancer}} in 1968 at the age of sixty. In the film The Diamond Wizard (1954), he played a U.S. Treasury Agent in London who, ironically, is trying to quit smoking. Throughout the film, different characters prevent him from lighting up. After the rousing finale, however, as a reward for his heroism, he is finally allowed to have <b>a</b> cigarette. <b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> puff and joyously exhales.|$|R
50|$|One day Pamban Swami called Chinaswami Jothidar to {{look for}} land in Tiruvanmiyur as his last days were near. Pamban Swami marked the floor corners with his leg all {{arrangements}} were made to for that portion of land to be purchased. On 30 May 1929 at 7:15 am Pamban Swami called his followers and advised them to believe in Lord Murugan. Then <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> held it inside his stomach and entered samādhi state.|$|E
5000|$|Ely was {{strongly}} opposed to capital punishment, a position reinforced after he voluntarily witnessed {{the execution of}} Victor Feguer on March 15, 1963, the most recent execution in Iowa, and the last federal execution in the United States until the execution of Timothy McVeigh on June 11, 2001. Ely recounted his memories of the execution saying [...] "The rope snapped, and as he hung in the air, suddenly, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> I dug my elbow into the Associated Press man {{next to me and}} said, 'Look, George, human life fighting to preserve itself.'"; in fact, the breathing was the involuntary reflex of the corpse.|$|E
50|$|Fetters is {{best known}} for his head {{movement}} while on the mound. Prior to pitching, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and moved his head quickly 90 degrees to the left. He claimed that he was stressed when pitching as the reason for his head movement. While with the Arizona Diamondbacks in , Mark Grace imitated the same move when invited to pitch for one inning. During one game in the 2004 season, Houston Astro Craig Biggio imitated Fetters' head movement and scowl while batting against him, drawing laughter from the Houston crowd. Fetters is the cousin of American baritone Stephen Totter. He currently works as the Arizona Diamondbacks bullpen coach after 4 years as a quality control coach.|$|E
50|$|Dr. AllahDad Bohyo {{started his}} {{practical}} {{life as a}} teacher in 1957. Later on he was promoted as director of education and remained on this post till {{the last days of}} his life.

He worked his whole life for the promotion of language and literature, his favorite fields were research and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in social linguistics.|$|R
6000|$|He {{returned}} to America in 1885, {{and once more}} occupied the somewhat dilapidated historic mansion at Elmwood. Once more he moved amid his rare and precious books, and heard the birds singing in the elms {{that his father had}} planted, or in the clustered bushes back of the house. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in the struggle for international copyright. He was President of the American Copyright League, and wrote the memorable lines:-- ...|$|R
5000|$|Superman derives {{his power}} from the yellow Sun of Earth. Forced under a red sun akin to that of his homeworld, or exposed to red sun radiation, Superman rapidly loses his powers, {{reverting}} to the stature equal to a normal human. This version of Superman also needs to breathe, as <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath in [...] "Apokalips Now... Part 2" [...] before plunging into the ocean, and has a special suit for when he needs to operate in outer space.|$|R
5000|$|His {{opposition}} {{dated to}} his first cricket tour to South Africa. During the Port Elizabeth Test match, black South Africans were not only refused entry but beaten up by police. Because of problems with telephones, Wooldridge had to contact his London office from the committee room. Frank Keating, in The Guardian, recalled: [...] "He had written his piece; now he had to read it {{at the top of}} his voice in the presence of about 30 hard-faced members of the republic's ruling broederband... as all 30 pairs of ears listened in the chilly, unwelcoming atmosphere, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and dictated: 'The wretchedly awful face of apartheid was displayed here today when...'" ...|$|E
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 The water dripped from the faucet nearest the door. The little boy hid behind the toilet, in the stall {{closest to the}} window that opened onto the playground, and waited. He waited for school to end. IT was the last day, one more hour and he could leave {{and no one would}} stop him. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> he was eight years old. His elder brother had been {{nineteen}} when he 2 ̆ 7 d left. He 2 ̆ 7 d sat in his car, in the garage, opened the door and turned on the engine. It was simple, but the little boy didn 2 ̆ 7 t have a car. He had sat in this same spot everyday, curled up in the corner, no teachers yelling for him to pay attention, until they 2 ̆ 7 d read his record and then apologized in hushed tones. No big brother found as a substitute by his brother 2 ̆ 7 s guidance counselor the woman that gave him cookies because she felt guilty. 2 ̆...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cross of Saint Andrew!" [...] said Le Balafre; [...] "that is what I call an onslaught! Ay, these Ogilvies {{were ever}} but sorry {{neighbours}} to Glen Houlakin--an evil chance it was; but fate of war--fate of war.--When did this mishap befall, fair nephew?" [...] With that <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> draught of wine, {{and shook his}} head with much solemnity, when his kinsman replied that his family had been destroyed upon the festival of Saint Jude [October 28] last bypast.|$|R
50|$|Jayaji Rao died in 1886 and was {{succeeded by}} his son, Madho Rao Sindhia, then {{a boy in}} his tenth year. A council of Regency {{conducted}} the administration until 1894, when the Maharaja obtained powers. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> and active interest {{in the administration of}} the state, and had a comprehensive grasp of the work done in each department. In 1900 the Maharaja went to China during the Boxer Rebellion, at the same time presenting a hospital ship for the accommodation of the wounded.|$|R
50|$|While not yet 30 he was {{appointed}} district attorney of Oneida County and soon rose to the front rank of the profession there. Later he relocated to New York City. Though never <b>a</b> politician <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in public affairs and {{was a man of}} extensive learning. His conversational powers were of the highest order. He cultivated an interest in beauty, art, and literature, and he possessed one of the finest law libraries in the U.S., which, upon his death, he gave to Hamilton College.|$|R
5000|$|Hirsch devoted much of {{his time}} to schemes for the relief of Jews in lands where they were persecuted and oppressed. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> {{interest}} in the educational work of the Alliance Israelite Universelle, and on two occasions presented the society with gifts of a million francs. For some years, he regularly paid the deficits in the accounts of the Alliance, amounting to several thousand pounds a year.
