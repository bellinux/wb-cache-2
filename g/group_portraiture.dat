He also exerted a strong influence on Baroque portraiture through his student Anthony van Dyck. Van Dyck became court painter for Charles I of England and was influential on subsequent English portraiture. Other successful portraitists include Cornelis de Vos and Jacob Jordaens.

500|$|John Bellany (1942–2013), mainly {{focusing}} on the coastal communities of his birth, and Alexander Moffat (b. 1943), who concentrated on <b>portraiture,</b> <b>grouped</b> under the description of [...] "Scottish Realism", were among the leading Scottish intellectuals from the 1960s. The artists who came to prominence in the 1980s, sometimes known as the [...] "new Glasgow Boys", or [...] "Glasgow pups", were associated with Moffat and the Glasgow School of Art. They included Steven Campbell (1953–2007), Peter Howson (b. 1958), Ken Currie (b. 1960) and Adrian Wisniewski (b. 1958). Their figurative work had a comic book-like quality and put an emphasis on social commentary. Campbell and Wisniewski's post-modern painting adopted a whimsical approach to history. Campbell often employed figures reminiscent of characters from 1930s novels confronted by the disorder and confusion of the real world, as in his Young Men in Search of Simplicity (1989). Currie revived historical painting devoted to the socialist history of Glasgow {{in a series of}} paintings for the People's Palace in 1987. Currie also approached the problems of historical painting through his series of prints The Saracen Heads (1988). A parallel movement in Edinburgh, focused around the 369 Gallery in the city, included Caroline McNairn (b. 1955–2010), Robert Maclaurin (b. 1965) and Gwen Hardie (b. 1962).|$|R

40|$|Inclusion can {{be defined}} in various ways. However, it is most {{frequently}} connected with the education of people with special needs. The thesis highlights {{the meaning of a}} broader view of inclusion as integrating in society and describes in more detail the inclusion in the area of education. Awareness of diversity is a highly important factor in today’s politics of education worldwide. Among the factors having significant influence on the success of inclusion are teachers’ attitudes, beliefs and values. The success of inclusion depends mainly on the teachers – the curriculum, textbooks and workbooks form the basis for their work. These materials serve them to present also the contents regarding people with special needs and other groups that may have difficulties with social integration. By providing positive descriptions of all social groups, the education system stimulates equality in the society. The contents described in this thesis are defined as inclusive contents. The analysis of the curriculum, textbooks and workbooks inclusiveness for year one to three of primary education shows that the explicit inclusive contents prevail on the implicit ones. Participation, gender, the need for help and frequency of individual and <b>group</b> <b>portraiture</b> were also analyzed. The content analysis of the interviews with teachers who are successful at practical application of inclusion shows that they more frequently transmit the inclusive contents implicitly than explicitly. As a summary of the findings, key guidelines for dealing with inclusive contents in primary education were proposed. These guidelines have shown that systematic, as well as spontaneous transmission of inclusive contents are equally relevant. However, there are features of particular environments to be taken into account, and active participation {{to be included in the}} courses. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{consider}} the surrealist portrait and whether it has added {{to an understanding of}} portraiture as a genre. It uses Richard Brilliant's Portraiture (1991) and Shearer West's Portraiture (2004) as points of reference, using the limited examples of surrealist portraiture provided by both authors and their criteria for the consideration of portraiture in general. The thesis presents a number of other surrealist portraits, exploring whether Brilliant and West's criteria may have been modified had they analysed such images. It also seeks to identify any issues and new directions research may take in order to augment the study of portraiture. By focusing on surrealist portraiture, the thesis reflects on how a movement constructed and guided by human relationships, and informed by a number of principles of psychoanalytical theory has reflected such concerns in the portraiture they produced. An investigation of all surrealist portraits would have been impossible within the scope of this thesis; therefore, it has been necessary to select four key areas which most ably demonstrate issues relevant to portraiture: gender and self-exploration, photography, <b>group</b> <b>portraiture</b> and concealment. The thesis takes issue with Brilliant and West's view that likeness is an essential requirement of portraiture by providing a number of examples of surrealist portraiture which toy with expectations of likeness by the concealment of features, and incorporation of an alter-ego. Brilliant's assertion that inanimate objects have no position in portraiture is also explored through specific examples of surrealist portraiture. By considering specific examples of surrealist portraiture the thesis questions such conventional definitions as those proposed by Brilliant and West...|$|E
40|$|Containing {{over forty}} portraits, the frescoes by Domenico Ghirlandaio in the cappella maggiore of S. Maria Novella provide the {{opportunity}} to investigate the function and context of Quattrocento portraiture. Burckhardt's famous notion of Renaissance "individualism," usually seen as a sufficient explanation for the rise of this genre, is rejected in favour of corporate, especially family, motivations and modes of address. This necessitates an examination of consorterial traditions and patterns of patronage which are registered in the Tornaquinci chapel and enabled the acquisition of patronage rights to the chapel by the entire consorteria in October 1486. A biography is also supplied of Giovanni Tornabuoni, the man who paid for the decoration of this, his family monument, and closely supervised its progress. ** Both the apparently "realistic" style of Ghirlandaio's presentation {{of the family and}} its associates in "the most beautiful city" (praised in the chapel's dedication inscription of 1490) and the chapel's iconography are placed in a fundamentally religious context. <b>Group</b> <b>portraiture,</b> especially of donors, is seen as neither individualistic nor secular, nor as mere physiognomical reportage. Further levels of signification in the iconography are discussed, particularly references to the magnificence and generosity of the Tornaquinci as patrons and founders with a long tradition at the Dominican convent of S. Maria Novella. The family's salvation and fertility are also prayed for in a series of portraits which preserve the family in an arena of prayer and offering. They self-consciously address an audience both contemporary and future: seeking perpetual life through descendants and through eternal deliverance which is the reward for their good works, honourable reputation and patronage. The family's awareness of itself, its noble heritage and honour, is reflected in their dignified portrayal. Future descendants were shown exemplars; prayers for salvation and for fertile continuity were offered; sure access by the elect to paradise was visualised. Both Man and God were addressed: honour in the here and now, salvation in the eternal realm, each were granted to the worthy elect. Florence and the City of God were each embraced by naturalistic, recognisable form. The presence of portraits was necessary within a visual world reshaped, framed and ennobled...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to inquire}} {{of the study}} of genre of portraiture and the possibilities that has in order to explain general features of the History of Art. In that sense we have analyzed a group of portraits that belong to the official collection of Art of Region of Murcia, most of the works are shown {{for the first time in}} a scientific study while others were hidden for years as they are used as decoration for offices and public buildings. Our study has divided the portraits into different typologies, which we think is the most useful way to make an approach to portraiture, as the typology is the basic element that defines the features of compositions in the portraits. The eleven typologies that have arisen after our research are: state portraiture, bourgeois portraiture, civic portraiture, feminine portraiture, children portraiture, self-portrait, <b>group</b> <b>portraiture,</b> funerary portraiture, photographic portraiture and the iconotheques. The typology could be considered as a opened concept, as we can observe different typologies depending on the author, so it’s important to say that this eleven typologies are the reflection of the artistic, social and cultural context during the last centuries in the Region of Murcia. We’d like to note as well, that some of this categories and subcategories coincide to other national and international typologies, but some others, like civic portraiture or iconotheques, reflect an historic, social, and cultural context specific from the Region of Murcia. We have also proposed a didactic method to teach History of Art through the genre of portraiture. Our suggestion actually contains three different approaches to study History of Art using the portraits previously analyzed. The first way we suggest is the biographic approach, that tries to show general characteristics of History of Art from the study of a single author, being the portraiture the basis of the explanation. The second itinerary is based on a formal comparison of art-works, seeing the different styles of general History of Art that we could appreciate on portraiture. The third, and last, approach through portraiture consist of a historic tour using works of art to compare different social contexts, as art is always a reflection of the society in which is created...|$|E
