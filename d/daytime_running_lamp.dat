40|$|We {{report on}} an {{extension}} of the previously published two-step freeform optics tailoring algorithm using a Monge-Kantorovich mass transportation framework. The algorithm's ability to design multiple freeform surfaces allows for the inclusion of multiple distinct light paths and hence the implementation of multiple lighting functions in a single optical element. We demonstrate the procedure in the context of automotive lighting, in which a fog lamp and a <b>daytime</b> <b>running</b> <b>lamp</b> are integrated in a single optical element illuminated by two distinct groups of LEDs...|$|E
