5000|$|The concept Communal constructivism was {{developed}} by Leask and Younie (2001a) in 1995 through their research on the <b>European</b> <b>SchoolNet</b> [...] which demonstrated the value of experts collaborating to push the boundaries of knowledge i.e. communal construction of new knowledge between experts rather than social construction of knowledge as described by Vygotsky {{where there is a}} learner to teacher scaffolding relationship. [...] "Communal constructivism" [...] as a concept applies to those situations in which there is currently no expert knowledge or indeed research to underpin knowledge in an area. [...] "Communal constructivism" [...] refers specifically to the process of experts working together to create, record and publish new knowledge in emerging areas.

Teachers have been creating and testing e-learning resource materials to be used through the Internet. The school is part of the Sulinet Digital Knowledge Base the aim of which is to integrate informatics, learning and teaching materials into the process of school learning.The SCALE project is an EU sponsored project with 6 countries participating. It aims at developing an Internet-based method which can help to develop students’ argumentative skills in discussions and introduce the method of learning with the help of discussions to them.Within the ZORKA 2004 project, with the other schools involved in the Innovative School Network, the school has been developing digital teaching and learning resource materials to be used in teaching natural sciences.In the school year 2005/2006 the ESZTER project was organised by Sulinet Program Office (Programiroda), with innovative schools taking part, within which students were exploring the ethnic, language, religious and cultural heterogeneity of the EU countries. With the HEFOP 3.1.3. project the school can take part in the development program entitled ’Preparation for Competence-based Teaching’. All the 9-form students in this school are involved in it. The participation in the Socrates/Comenius school development program financed by the European Committee gives students the chance to improve their sense of solidarity and empathy. It also helps them to explore and respect the heterogeneity of European Culture and social traditions. This institute is the coordinator for 6 schools in the 3-year project entitled “For a European School of Solidarity” which aims at helping the participants to learn and cohabit with heterogeneity.|$|E
30|$|At {{this point}} in time, 87 – 89  % of the 16 - to - 24 -year-olds in Sweden and Norway used the Internet daily or almost every day (Nordicom 2012). However, a survey in 2011 – 2012 showed that {{students}} in neither {{of the two countries}} were frequent users of ICT at school compared to many other European countries (<b>European</b> <b>Schoolnet</b> 2012 a, b). Only a third of the Norwegian students in Grade eight had teachers using information and communication technology (ICT) equipment in more than 25  % of the lessons (<b>European</b> <b>Schoolnet</b> 2012 a). The corresponding number for Sweden was 40  % (<b>European</b> <b>Schoolnet</b> 2012 b). OECD (2011) reported that socioeconomically advantaged students in Sweden were more likely to use computers at school than students disadvantaged in this respect, whereas, in Norway, no difference between these groups was found. Altogether, the surveys referred to above indicate that young people in Sweden and Norway use ICTs to a fairly low degree during lessons at school.|$|E

40|$|The {{classroom}} {{physical space}} enfolds several dimensions {{such as the}} social, cultural, architectural and technological. The current scenario of digitally equipped classrooms in which new pedagogical approaches based on collaborative learning, project-based learning and personalized learning are being used, call for the need to rethink the classroom physical space.

Thus, this paper aims to present the perspective the authors have concerning the classroom physical space as a learning ecosystem and to start building the bridges between different approaches to space and relating them to the classroom physical space, in order to create an innovative interior design strategy that will improve the use of classroom physical space in its different dimensions.

A major motivation for learning scientists to develop design research as a methodology is to contribute to theory and educational practice through rigorous research without avoiding the complexities and messiness in authentic educational settings. There are many examples of successful implementation of collaborative, knowledge-construction oriented pedagogies using socio-cognitive and socio-metacognitive tools in formal and informal educational settings {{as well as in}} teacher professional development. However, there are many challenges to scaling up such innovations beyond small-scale implementation, including that of developing into “fatal mutations” (Brown, 1992).

40|$|The {{classroom}} {{is one of}} the privileged environments aiming knowledge construction and the establishment of social relationships as well as of cultural exchanges. Studies regarding classroom environment, focusing the pedagogical approaches, are countless; however, studies regarding the classroom environment as the physical space are significantly fewer. Nevertheless, a new classroom physical space – the Future Classroom Lab (FCL) - has been developed based, in part, on 21 st Century Skills. Spaces like the FCL are spreading throughout Europe, existing already more than 2, 600 FCL’s. The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) advent and the ICT-based emergent pedagogical approaches contributed to the increase of studies concerning the physical classroom environment, as the classroom space and layout became no longer the most suitable. But are these new spaces suitable for the Non in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) /Refugee population and are they being designed and conceived to promote the inclusion of these populations? Considering this scenario and the NEET and Refugee populations’ current crisis in the European Union [1], [2]) the research that this paper presents aims to investigate innovative interior design strategies to the classroom architectural space in order to promote the inclusion of these specific populations: through the analysis of how the FCL spaces are being used in the <b>European</b> <b>Schoolnet</b> FCL network and through the observation of some of these spaces in Portugal, a Digital Future Classroom (DFC) is going to be designed. Privileging the enabling spaces approach [3] on the classroom complexity spaces (architectural, social, cognitive, emotional, epistemological, cultural and organizational, technological and the virtual space), this ongoing research aims at understanding how to “translate” these concepts into the classroom interior design, aiming the promotion of the user’s inclusion. This analysis also gathers the spatial and pedagogical semiotics as well as the spatial pedagogy inherent to the classroom. This article presents the relevance of the research supported by its theoretical and conceptual frameworks and the methodology that is being adopted. The present research, mainly qualitative, can be considered under the constructivist (or socio-constructivist) paradigm and with a slight nuance of the critical theory paradigm. Considering also that “The researcher-as-bricoleur-theorist works between and within competing and overlapping perspectives and paradigms” [4, p. 5] the research design resorts to triangulation, as it uses “different methods in an attempt to confirm, cross-validate, or corroborate findings” [5, p. 24] in order to respond to each of the set objectives fulfilling all the requests...|$|E
40|$|When {{it comes}} to inquiring the {{diffusion}} of the video game, and mainly the computer game, outside of a recreational context, {{the use of this}} peculiar medium in schools is certainly {{one of the most interesting}} scenarios, for computer games have a by this time well studied and documented educational potential, and represent a powerful tool for learning. Learning is, in fact, not a side effect when playing video games; every fraction of a second of gameplay needs the player to learn something, whether hand-to-eye coordination or virtuoso-like skills in key pressing, whether game-related information or educational content that is somehow supposed to make it into the learners' mind. This tendency to instill knowledge, though, has probably been the biggest mistake of the highly unsuccessful (pedagogically speaking, yet not on the market) “edutainment” approach to educational computer games. Even if such a content transfer process might work for mechanical learning, it surely will not be of any use to achieve a meaningful learning (Novak 1998), i. e. a personal, active and motivation-supported kind of learning that can lead a pupil to actually and effectively learn a second or foreign language – which is, obviously, not a mere collection of linguistic notions, but rather a whole new grammatical, socio-pragmatic, para- and extralinguistic and most of all cultural apparatus. A computer game that fits in a proper SLA/FLA (second/foreign language acquisition) methodology, should therefore refer, first of all, to a socio-cultural educational theory, which looks at the broader process of using video games as a tool for learning, by stressing the role of context, actors (both learners and educators) and their mutual interaction, experiences and culture. A constructionist approach should then be taken account of: the construction of knowledge, as meaningful through orientation in a social context, becomes paramount […]. Instead of conceiving content, skills and attitudes as residing within the user, knowledge is transferred to culture, tools and communities (Egenfeldt-Nielsen 2007 : 88). Computer games are also virtual locations for real situated learning (Lave and Wenger 1991); hence, abstract and decontextualised learning objects are again thrown aside in favour of cooperation and co-construction of knowledge, usually within a community of practice. It could be ultimately said that educational theories which can effectively take advantage of gaming, and therefore the computer game medium, actually deviate from the behaviourist pattern of edutainment, or the cognitive focus on game-related skills like problem-solving or coordination. One question is now likely to arise: given the importance of context, is the classroom an effective and meaningful environment for educational computer games use? Or does the nature itself of digital gaming rule out the institutional paradigm as we know it? The answer is, of course, twofold: on one side, play sessions hardly fit in school schedules, the classroom architecture often prevents such activities, not to mention that schools may (not to say: usually) lack the sufficient technological equipment. On the other, successful experimentations of educational computer games use in the classroom have been conducted (Kirriemuir and McFarlane 2002; Squire 2004; Egenfeldt-Nielsen 2007, in some respects; Wastiau, Kearney and Van den Berghe 2009), however not yet specifically for SLA/FLA. The findings of these researches are currently being revised by the present writer in a forthcoming work, which focuses on building a “playful methodology” for learning Italian as a second language; this methodology uses computer games extensively, as a tool for active learning, language discovery and practicing. It also describes the reorganization of the teacher's role within the “edurector” metaphor (Lombardi in press), and it discusses the implications of digital gaming activities in the classroom, as well as their part in relocating learning in a blended environment.
