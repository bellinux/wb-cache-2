5|$|Wyatt Earp and Cochise County sheriff Johnny Behan were {{interested}} in the same sheriff's position and also may have shared an interest in the same woman, Josephine Marcus, known as Sadie. Citizens of Tombstone believed that Behan and Marcus were married, but Behan was a known womanizer and had sex with prostitutes and other women. Marcus ended the relationship after she came home and found Behan in bed with the wife of a friend and <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> <b>out,</b> although she used the Behan surname through the end of that summer. She rented her home sometime before April 1881 to a doctor, George Goodfellow.|$|E
5|$|In spring 1881, Marcus found Behan in {{bed with}} the wife of a friend and <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> <b>out,</b> {{although}} she still used the Behan surname through the end of that summer. Earp had a common-law relationship with Mattie Blaylock, who was listed as his wife in the June 1880 census. She suffered from severe headaches and became addicted to laudanum, a commonly used opiate and painkiller. There are no contemporary records in Tombstone of a relationship between Josephine and Earp. Tombstone diarist George W. Parsons never mentioned seeing Wyatt and Josephine together and neither did John Clum in his memoirs. But Earp and Marcus certainly knew each other, as Behan and Earp both had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon.|$|E

25|$|When locals {{heard of}} the group's plans for {{starting}} a new society in the Americas, rumours were spread and criticism was lodged against Pantisocracy. This was compounded when Southey's aunt, with whom he was living, found out about both the idea and Southey's intention in marrying Edith Fricker, a person that his aunt felt was below his station. His aunt immediately stopped talking to him and <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of her house. When Coleridge left for London, his thoughts about Pantisocracy began to change and he backed off {{his role in the}} matter. This was partly to blame for the intervention by Mary Evans and his brother George, and partly about Southey advocating for a master class and a servant class in their new society, all of which upset Coleridge. The idea did not completely collapse until Southey abandoned the plans in August 1795 in order to become a lawyer.|$|E
