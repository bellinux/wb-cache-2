25|$|Prior to the July 2006 Lebanon War, Israel {{had been}} {{lobbying}} for UNIFIL to either {{take a more}} active role vis-a-vis Hezbollah (for example, preventing Hezbollah from stationing near UNIFIL posts to fire at the IDF and into northern Israel) or {{to step out of the}} region (thereby voiding the Lebanese government’s <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> deploying Lebanese Armed Forces along the border).|$|E
25|$|LCBL field {{managers}} {{are among the}} youngest in any summer college baseball league. This gives an unrivaled level of comfort to the players, being coached {{by a man who}} is closer to their age than their college head coach. However, youth or inexperience is not a viable <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> commanding the dugout. The interview process is thorough and each must take their leadership duties very seriously. Upon being hired, managers select their assistant coach and set aside at least one day a week for practice time.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The One, Paul Presley {{stated that}} [...] "Lucasfilm {{appears to have}} taken all of the {{elements}} that worked in its previous releases and, not only incorporated them into this tale of scurvy swashbuckling, but even improved on them in the process!" [...] Like the other reviewers, he praised its controls. He also lauded its [...] "hilarious storyline, strong characters and ... intriguing setting", but complained about graphical slowdowns. Nick Clarkson of Amiga Computing cited the game's graphics as [...] "flawless", noting that [...] "the characters are superbly animated and the backdrops simply ooze atmosphere." [...] He highly praised its sound effects and music, and believed that its controls [...] "couldn't be simpler". The staff of Amiga Action wrote that the [...] "attention to detail and the finely tuned gameplay cannot be faulted." [...] They called the graphics [...] "stunning throughout", and believed that, when they were combined with the [...] "excellent Caribbean tunes", {{the result is a}} game filled with [...] "character and atmosphere." [...] They ended by stating that [...] "there is absolutely no <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> owning this game." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1847, Holmes {{was hired}} as Parkman Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Harvard Medical School, where he served as dean until 1853 and taught until 1882. Soon after his appointment, Holmes was criticized by the all-male student body for {{considering}} granting admission to a woman named Harriot Kezia Hunt. Facing opposition from not only students but also university overseers and other faculty members, {{she was asked to}} withdraw her application. Harvard Medical School would not admit a woman until 1945. Holmes's training in Paris led him to teach his students the importance of anatomico-pathological basis of disease, and that [...] "no doctrine of prayer or special providence is to be his <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> looking straight at secondary causes." [...] Students were fond of Holmes, to whom they referred as [...] "Uncle Oliver". One teaching assistant recalled: [...] "He enters [...] and is greeted by a mighty shout and stamp of applause. Then silence, and there begins a charming hour of description, analysis, anecdote, harmless pun, which clothes the dry bones with poetic imagery, enlivens a hard and fatiguing day with humor, and brightens to the tired listener the details for difficult though interesting study." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 29 against Kansas, Burke {{recorded}} his fourth career double-double, with 23 points and 10 assists. He scored all 23 {{points in the}} second half and overtime, including a game-tying deep three-pointer with 4.2 seconds remaining. Burke describes the [...] shot as [...] "...probably the biggest shot I ever made and definitely a shot I'll always remember." [...] He also scored a layup with his team trailing by 5 points with 21 seconds remaining. Burke scored eight points in the final 1:15 of regulation time, as Michigan posted a 14–4 run in the final 2:52 to force overtime. He also gave the team its first lead since very early in the game in overtime with a three-point shot. It marked {{the first time that a}} player had 20 or more points and 10 or more assists in a Sweet Sixteen game since Billy Donovan did so in the 1986 tournament for Rick Pitino's [...] In the regional finals on March 31 against the Donovan-coached Florida Gators, Burke contributed 15 points, 7 assists, 3 steals and a career-high 8 rebounds. Burke was named South Regional Tournament Most Outstanding Player. He was joined on the 5-man South All-Regional team by teammates [...] Mitch McGary and Nik Stauskas. Burke also earned ESPN.com Player of the Week recognition. Although Burke admits that the team he led, with three starting freshman and no seniors, was young, he said that was no excuse pointing at the 2012 tournament champions, Kentucky, saying [...] "You saw what Kentucky did last year. We felt that being young isn’t an <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> going far in the tournament." [...] Burke scored 24 points in the April 8, championship game against Louisville and made the 7-man All-Tournament team (which was revised multiple times) along with teammates McGary and Albrecht. The turning point of the game was described as a missed call by the referees when as Michigan trailed 67–64 with 5 minutes left, Burke pinned Peyton Siva's dunk attempt with a clean all-ball block, but was called for a foul resulting in two made free throws by Siva. Michigan never got closer than 4 points the rest of the game. Burke finished his sophomore season with 1,231 points, surpassing the former school record for sophomore season career point total of 1,218 by Chris Webber. His final total of 260 assists established the Michigan career record, and his average of 6.7 assists per game led the Big Ten.|$|E

2500|$|Even if the lex curiata became largely ceremonial, it {{retained}} enough {{force to}} be useful for political tactics when evoked.

2500|$|The {{rules of}} courtly love were codified {{by the late}} 12th century in Andreas Capellanus' highly {{influential}} work De Amore ("Concerning Love").

Much of its structure and its sentiments were derived from Ovid's Ars amatoria.|$|E
2500|$|Despite Kinetic's win, Harry H. and James were {{strongly}} criticised {{for failing to}} secure 2/3 clients Lord Sugar had arranged for them.

During the treat, it was strongly implied had Kinetic lost, either Harry H. or James (most likely the latter) would've been fired.|$|E

After Gwen joins Torchwood, she meets Davidson again outside a nightclub where a man has been killed by a [...] "sex monster"-possessed woman. Like Gwen's boyfriend Rhys (Kai Owen), Andy initially believes {{that she has been}} promoted to [...] "special ops". He later appears to begrudgingly assist Gwen in series one finale [...] "End of Days" [...] (2007), and the second series opener [...] "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" [...] (2008). In [...] "Adrift", Davidson calls Gwen to investigate sudden disappearances in Cardiff, and admonishes her for her hardened perspective. During the episode he reveals his affection for her and resentment toward Rhys, which Gwen learns is his <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> attending her wedding. During [...] "Exit Wounds", Andy helps Gwen in coordinating the police force's response to the bombs planted by Gray (Lachlan Nieober) and Captain John Hart (James Marsters), subsequently working alongside Rhys to keep the attacking alien Weevils out of the police station.|$|E

2500|$|Powell further {{stated that}} the {{continental}} nations held the nuclear weapon in such esteem that they had conventional forces [...] "manifestly inadequate to impose more than brief delay upon an assault from the East. The theory of nuclear deterrence states that, should Warsaw Pact forces score substantial military successes or make substantial advances {{this side of the}} Iron Curtain, the United States would initiate the suicidal duel of strategic nuclear exchanges with the Soviet Union. One can only greet this idea with an even more emphatic 'One must be mad to think of it'. That a nation staring ultimate military defeat in the face would choose self-extermination is unbelievable enough; but that the United States, separated from Europe by the Atlantic Ocean, would regard the loss of the first pawn in the long game as necessitating harakiri is not describable by the ordinary resources of language". The reason why governments, including in the US, supported nuclear weapons was that [...] "enormous economic and financial interests are vested in the continuation and elaboration of nuclear armaments. I believe, however, that the crucial explanation lies in another direction: the nuclear hypothesis provides governments with an <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> doing what they have no intention of doing anyhow, but for reasons which they find it inconvenient to specify".|$|E
