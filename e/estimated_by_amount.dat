In our study, {{the influence of the}} reversed transformation in microcrystalline fast-quenched alloys on completeness of the next direct transformation and on the stabilization of reversed austenite has been investigated. Completeness of direct γ-α transformation in the ribbon is mainly <b>estimated</b> <b>by</b> <b>amount</b> of ultradispersed and nanocrystalline components of grains, where γ-α transformation was partly or fully suppressed. Indeed, it was shown earlier that martensitic crystals could not form in nanocrystalline grains of bulk Fe-Mn-C and Fe-Ni alloys [6, 7].

40|$|Quantitative genetic {{models for}} the {{evolution}} of exaggerated male traits through female mate choice predict that selection on male ornaments should cause a correlated response in female preferences. Furthermore, female selectivity should be inversely related to costs of mate choice. Here we use a stalk-eyed fly, Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni (Diptera: Diopsidae), which exhibits pronounced sexual dimorphism in eye span, to evaluate these predictions. Field observations reveal that each evening females aggregate while males disperse among roosting sites where mating occurs. A positive regression between male relative eye span and the number of females in an aggregation suggests that sexual selection acts on male eye span. Mate choice experiments in the lab, using flies after 13 generations of bidirectional selection on male relative eye span, reveal that females from long eye-span lines and an unselected population preferred long eye-span males. Short eye-span line females, however, preferred short eye-span males, demonstrating a genetic correlation between female preference and a sexually selected male trait. Eye span of the largest male in a field aggregation correlated positively with female age, as <b>estimated</b> <b>by</b> <b>amount</b> of eye pigment, and was independent of egg number, thereby providing no evidence that mate choice impairs female survival or fecundity. 1...|$|E

40|$|Reduced {{recruitment}} {{rates in}} Utah mule deer (Odocoilus hemionus) showed that significant losses in production were accruing during pregnancy, the neonatal period {{or during the}} first few months after birth. The primary objectives of the study were to determine the time, extent and possible causes of these losses. Corpora luteal and fetal rates were estimated by examining the reproductive tracts of 125 carcasses collected on selected herd units in Utah and by observing the reproductive tracts of 136 female deer captured in Spanish Fork Canyon. A laparotomy was performed on each captured female to allow visual examination of the reproductive tract without sacrificing the doe. Live-birth rates were estimated by observing and monitoring pregnant wild does held captive during the fawning period, and by observing free - ranging does tagged with radio- transmitters. Fawn mortality was estimated by monitoring radio-tagged fawns, captured shortly after birth until fawn:doe ratios were observed the following fall. The greatest loss in production occurred during the post-natal period. Annual fawn losses averaged 26. 4 percent, while a 3. 7 percent interuterine loss occurred before midpregnancy and a 9. 5 percent fetal loss was recorded between midpregnancy and parturition. No single mortality factor appeared to be responsible for most of the fawn losses. Condition of the pregnant doe on the winter range was investigated as the cause of reduced recruitment. The condition of the doe had to be accurately estimated while the doe was alive, before the relationship between condition and reproductive success could be evaluated. The condition of 43 carcasses, based upon a modified nutritional status index that included weight corrected for size and age, was highly significantly correlated to condition of the same carcasses <b>estimated</b> <b>by</b> <b>amount</b> of kidney fat (r= 0. 70, P Weights and sizes of fawns captured shortly after birth were not significantly related to subsequent survival...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Pooling excreta, within treatments, {{prior to}} {{calorimetry}} reduces {{the time and}} cost of the bioassay for true metabolizable energy (TME) and does not alter mean TME values. How-ever, by ignoring the among-bird variance of the gross energy per unit weight of excreta (G) and its covariance {{with the weight of}} excreta (D), the standard errors of mean TME values are subject to bias. An additional factor for consideration is the effect of the sampling error from pooled aggre-gates. These factors were examined using data from TME bioassays of 20 feedingstuffs and by measuring the standard deviations of gross energy values for subsamples from pooled excreta. The standard deviation of G for each unit subsample from pooled excreta samples was. 0381 kj/g with 20 degrees of freedom. The resulting contribution to the standard errors of mean TME values was so small that replicate subsampling from the bulked excreta is of minor importance, although a useful precaution. However, ignoring the among-bird variation in G as a consequence of pooling excreta caused the standard errors of mean TME values to be incorrectly <b>estimated</b> <b>by</b> <b>amounts</b> ranging from — 62 to + 64 %.

50|$|Titanium in zircon {{geothermometry}} {{is a form}} of a geothermometry technique {{by which}} the crystallization temperature of a zircon crystal can be <b>estimated</b> <b>by</b> the <b>amount</b> of titanium atoms which can only be found in the crystal lattice. In zircon crystals, titanium is commonly incorporated, replacing similarly charged zirconium and silicon atoms. This process is relatively unaffected by pressure and highly temperature dependent, with the amount of titanium incorporated rising exponentially with temperature, making this an accurate geothermometry method. This measurement of titanium in zircons can be used to estimate the cooling temperatures of the crystal and infer conditions during which it crystallized. Compositional changes in the crystals growth rings can be used to estimate the thermodynamic history of the entire crystal. This method is useful as it can be combined with radiometric dating techniques that are commonly used with zircon crystals (see zircon geochronology), to correlate quantitative temperature measurements with specific absolute ages. This technique can be used to estimate early Earth conditions, determine metamorphic facies, or to determine the source of detrital zircons, among other uses.|$|R
