40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{determine}} colonization rate of candida in oral cavity of healthy individuals, diabetics and <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> individuals. Material and methods: Samples were collected from oral cavity of 50 HIV sero positive individuals, 50 diabetics and 50 healthy individuals by swabbing palatal mucosa, dorsum of tongue and buccal mucosa with a sterile swab. Samples were processed by inoculating on Hi Chrome Agar and speciation was done by growth on Hi Chrome agar, germ tube test, chlamydospore formation on CMA, pellicle formation in SDA broth and growth at 45 ºc. Results: 27 HIV sero positive individuals (54 %) carried candida in their oral cavities (single strain in 44 % and combination of strains in 10 %). Whereas it was 44 % in diabetics (single species in 38 % and a combination of species in 6 %) and 24 % in healthy individuals (only single species). Candida albicans accounts for 41. 66 % in healthy individuals, 68 % in diabetics and 42. 42 % in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> <b>persons.</b> other species isolated were Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida glabrata in all 3 groups in addition to Candida dubliniensis in healthy and <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> individuals and C. krusei in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> <b>persons</b> only.

40|$|Background: Genital {{ulcerative}} disease {{is one of}} the risk factors for acquisition of HIV. As HSV- 2 infection is currently {{the most common cause of}} genital {{ulcerative disease}}, it acts as a potential risk factor for HIV infection. The present study was undertaken to know the seroprevalence of antibodies to HSV- 2 in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> individuals and in the general population, and to ascertain if HSV- 2 is a risk factor for developing HIV infection. Methods: The study group included one hundred new <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> <b>persons</b> irrespective of active genital herpes or history of genital herpes. Fifty age- and sex- matched healthy volunteers were included as controls. In all patients and controls, diagnostic serology was done for HSV- 2 using HSV- 2 -specific glycoprotein IgG 2 by indirect immunoassay using the ELISA test. Statistical value &#x 2032;P&#x 2032; was calculated using the Chi-squared test. Results: Out of the 100 <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositives,</b> 66 were males and 34 were females with an age range of 20 - 54 years. In only 22 (19 males and 3 females) of these, positive history of genital herpes was obtained. In 49 out of the 100 <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositives,</b> IgG 2 antibodies against HSV- 2 were detected. In the control group, 11 out of 50 controls were seropositive for HSV- 2 IgG 2 antibody. There was a statistically significant association between HSV- 2 and HIV seropositivity with &#x 2032;P&#x 2032; value < 0. 005.

40|$|Abstract: The {{frequency}} of {{coronary heart disease}} (CHD) is increasing among <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> <b>persons.</b> This phenomenon {{may be related to}} HIV disease itself, the use of antiretroviral medications and increased length of survival, or the synergism of these factors. In this study we have calculated the 10 -year CHD risk estimate and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in a cohort of 118 <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> chronic drug users, including those who are on HAART with or without protease inhibitors (PI). The results showed that the 10 -year coronary heart disease risk among the <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> drug users was 4. 8 ± 5. 7, which is within the range of results published for other HIV infected cohorts. The 10 -year CHD risk was significantly higher in men (5. 9 ± 6. 1, p< 0. 001) than in women (1. 7 ± 2. 4), due to their gender and the pre-menopausal mean age of the women (39. 4 ± 7. 3 years of age), despite a significantly higher rate of abdominal obesity (54. 8 % in women vs. 8. 1 % in men, p< 0. 001) and lower HDL (61. 3 % in women vs. 40 % in men, p= 0. 042).

40|$|Background Methamphetamine (METH) use {{and human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infection are highly comorbid, and both are associated with increased prevalence of affective distress. Delineating the trajectory of affective distress {{in the context of}} METH dependence and HIV infection is important given the implications for everyday functional impairment, adverse health behaviors, and increased risk for adverse health outcomes. Methods We conducted a five-year longitudinal investigation involving 133 METH-dependent (74 <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive)</b> and 163 non-METH-dependent (90 <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive)</b> <b>persons</b> to examine both long-standing patterns and transient changes in affective distress. Mixed-effect regression models with random subject-specific slopes and intercepts evaluated the effect of METH dependence, HIV serostatus, and related variables on affective distress, as measured by the Profile of Mood States. Results Transient changes in affective distress were found to be greater among those with a diagnosis of current MDD, briefer durations of abstinence from METH, and higher quantity of METH consumed. Weak associations were observed among static (time-independent predictors) covariates and long-standing patterns in affective distress. Limitations Study lacked data pertaining to the participants' involvement in METH treatment and relied on respondent-driven sampling. Conclusions Our longitudinal investigation of the t rajectory of affective distress indicated that specific and dynamic indices of current METH use were associated with greater transient changes in mood. In the evaluation and treatment of affective distress, recency and quantity of current METH use are important to consider given their association with heightened affective distress and mood instability over time. © 2013 Elsevier B.

The predominant proportion of the cohort had a high viral load, suggesting that their use of illicit drugs has an influence on either adherence or effectiveness of antiretroviral medication. Increased viral load was significantly associated with metabolic syndrome (OR= 2. 23, 95 % CI: 1. 12, 4. 47; p= 0. 023), high fasting glucose (OR= 1. 61, 95 % CI: 1. 02, 2. 55; p= 0. 042) and low HDL levels (OR= 1. 41, 95 %CI: 1. 01, 1. 98; p= 0. 046), after controlling for age gender, smoking, PI exposure, BMI and CD 4. HAART with or without PI did not significantly impact the 10 -year CHD risk estimate or metabolic syndrome in this cohort. The estimated effect of PI, however, was positively and significantly related to triglyceride levels (effect estimate= 95. 81; 95 % CI: 39. 40, 152. 21; p< 0. 01) after controlling for age, gender, smoking, viral load, CD 4 cell count and BMI. Heavy use of cigarettes and crack/cocaine was inversely associated with obesity (OR= 0. 84, 95 % CI: 0. 67, 0. 99; p= 0. 049; OR= 0. 43, 95 % CI: 0. 19, 0. 98; p= 0. 044, respectively), while use of marijuana tended to be associated with increased central obesity (p= 0. 08). Heavy cigarette smoking was significantly associated with low HDL (OR= 3. 06, 95 % CI: 1. 18; 7. 95, p= 0. 02).

40|$|Many HIV-positive persons {{reportedly}} {{continue to}} engage in at-risk behavior. We compared the sexual and drug-using practices of HIV-positive persons {{before and after the}} diagnosis of HIV infection to determine whether their behavior had changed. To this end, in 2006, we conducted a cross-sectional study involving clinical centers in five Italian cities. Each center was asked to enroll 100 persons aged 18 years or older who had a diagnosis of HIV infection that dated back at least 2 years. Data were collected with a specifically designed questionnaire, administered during a structured interview. The McNemar chi(2) test was used to compare the data before and after the diagnosis. A total of 497 persons participated (65. 5 % males; median age of 40 years; age range, 34 - 45 years). The most common exposure categories were: heterosexual contact (43. 4 %), homosexual contact (27. 2 %), and injecting drug use (20. 6 %). Although the percentage of drug users significantly decreased after diagnosis, 32. 4 % of injectors continued to use drugs, and approximately half of them exchanged syringes.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is lymphotropic and neurotropic. In vivo clinical and immunological abnormalities develop {{in a large}} proportion of long-term <b>HIV</b> antibody <b>seropositive</b> <b>persons.</b> Different stages of HIV infection are marked by expression of HIV genes, production of HIV antibodies, formation of antigen/antibody complexes and clearance of such complexes. Transient HIV antigenemia appearing generally 6 - 8 wk prior to HIV antibody (HIV-Ab) seroconversion and lasting 3 - 4 mth is generally seen in acute infection. IgM antibodies predominantly to core proteins may occasionally be detectable when, or just before, IgG antibodies appear. If IgG antibodies to both envelope and core proteins persist in the absence of HIV-Ag the short-term prognosis is relatively good. However, HIV-Ag seroconversion may appear at any time after HIV-Ab seroconversion. Progression to AIDS is strongly associated with declining or absent levels of IgG antibodies to p 24. IgG 2 and IgG 4 antibodies to HIV, which are mainly directed to p 24, disappear most dramatically. Titers of antibodies to HIV p 24 below 64 are strongly associated with the presence of HIV antigen and a poor clinical outcome. HIV antigen was detected frequently in sera from children in all stages of infection in contrast to adults whose sera were generally HIV-Ag negative when asymptomatic and positive when AIDS was apparent. HIV antigen may be less efficiently detected with the present assays in sera from regions where the prototype strains of HIV (HTLV-III and LAV) are less prevalent, like Central Africa. Persistence of HIV-Ag in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) appears to be pathognomonic for progressive encephalopathy, particularly in children. Levels of HIV-Ag in serum, and possibly in CSF, can be decreased by nucleoside analogues, such as AZT. This indicates HIV-Ag and possibly antibody to HIV core protein p 24 as suitable markers for selecting individuals for antiviral therapy as well as monitoring the efficacy of such therap...|$|R

We {{took advantage of the}} routine screening of migrants for HIV infection, upon arrival in Kuwait from the areas with high HIV prevalence, to 1) estimate the HIV seroprevalence among migrant workers entering Kuwait and to 2) ascertain if any significant time trend or changes had occurred in HIV seroprevalence among these migrants over the study period. Methods The monthly aggregates of daily number of migrant workers tested and number of <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> were used to generate the monthly series of proportions of <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> (per 100, 000) migrants over a period of 120 months from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2006. We carried out spectral analysis of these time series data on monthly proportions (per 100, 000) of <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> migrants. Results Overall HIV seroprevalence (per 100, 000) among the migrants was 21 (494 / 2328582) (95 % CI: 19 - 23), ranging from 11 (95 % CI: 8 – 16) in 2003 to 31 (95 % CI: 24 - 41) in 1998. There was no discernable pattern in the year-specific proportions of <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> migrants up to 2003; in subsequent years there was a slight but consistent increase in the proportions of <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> migrants. However, the Mann-Kendall test showed non-significant (P = 0. 741) trend in de-seasonalized data series of proportions of <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> migrants. The spectral density had a statistically significant (P = 0. 03) peak located at a frequency (radians) 2. 4, which corresponds to a regular cycle of three-month duration in this study. Auto-correlation function did not show any significant seasonality (correlation coefficient at lag 12 = – 0. 025, P = 0. 575).

40|$|Background: Candidiasis is {{the most}} common {{opportunistic}} infection in human immunodeficiency virus (<b>HIV)</b> <b>seropositive</b> patients, starting from asymptomatic colonization to pathogenic forms and gradual colonization of non-albicans in patients with advanced immunosuppression leads to resistance for azole group of antifungal drugs with high rate of morbidity and mortality. Objectives: To isolate the Candida species and determine of antifungal drug susceptibility against fluconazole, itraconazole, nystatin, amphotericin B, and clotrimazolein <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> and control individuals, with or without clinical oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC). Materials and Methods: Includes samples from faucial region of 70 subjects with and without clinical candidiasis in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> and controls were aseptically inoculated onto Sabaraud′s Dextrose Agar media and yeasts were identified for the specific species by Corn Meal Agar, sugar fermentation and heat tolerance tests. Antifungal drug susceptibility of the isolated species was done against above-mentioned drugs by E-test and disc diffusion method. Results: The commonly isolated species in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> and controls were Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis Candida guilliermondii and Candida dubliniensis isolated only in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> patients.

Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium accounted for 19 % (95 / 500) and 14 % (70 / 500) respectively, while Schistosoma mansoni, Strongyloides stercoralis and hookworm together accounted for 2 % (10 / 500) of intestinal parasitic infections among the <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> patients. There was no significant difference (p[*]>[*] 0. 05) in urinary parasitic infection between <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> 1 % (2 / 500) and seronegative patients 0. 7 % (2 / 300). Most, 60 (86 %) out of 70, of the urinary tract infection among the <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> patients was due to bacteria with E. coli being the most predominant isolate, 28 (47 %) out of 60. There {{was no significant difference in}} infections based on age and gender. Conclusion G. lamblia and Cryptosporidium were the most common gastrointestinal parasites detected while bacteria accounted for majority of the urinary tract infections among the <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> patients at the hospital. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the inciden’ce of {{low birth weight}} infants born to <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> women and to demonstrate any effects of antiretroviral therapy on birth weight. Methods: Retrospective review of all obstetrical medical records from January 1, 1995 through June 30, 1998 to identify <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> women. We evaluated their antiretroviral therapy, CD 4 counts, and birth weights of their newborns. We conducted detailed review of the clinical and laboratory findings for the HIV-infected untreated patients, women who received ZDV antepartum alone, and those who received PIs as part of antiretroviral treatment. Results: The frequency of low birth weight infants was significantly increased in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> compared to <b>HIV</b> seronegative parturients. Low birth weight infants were more frequent among HIV infected women with lower CD 4 counts but the association was not statistically significant. Women who received no antepartum treatment, antepartum only ZDV, and those treated with PIs had significantly more low birth weight infants than did comparison groups. <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> women also had high frequencies of several obstetrical risk factors for low birth weight infants...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationships}} between hope, social support, uncer-tainty in illness, and spirituality and their effect on the perceived health of <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> men. A prospective design was used to test a causal model on a sample of 125 <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> men recruited from urban HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics. A goodness of fit index of. 90 and a compara-tive fit index of. 79 indicated minimal fit of the theorized model with the data. Findings revealed significant, positive paths from hope to perceived health and from spirituality to hope. Signifi-cant negative paths were found between social support and uncertainty in illness and uncer-tainty in illness and hope. The level of hope may play an important role in enhancing health of <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> men...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infection is endemic in South Africa. Non-Hodgkin lympho-ma (NHL) occurs with increased frequency in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> individuals. The increase in NHL {{has been more}} marked in the last decade, with HIV being the major contributor to this increase. More than 70 % of the adult NHL patients at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital (CHBAH), Soweto, Johannesburg, are <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive.</b> In addition, <b>HIV</b> has impacted on the clinical pre-sentation—being more aggressive and atypical. Histologically, HIV-NHL typically manifests as B-cell, high grade lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); Burkitt lymphoma (BL); B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and BL and plasmablastic lymphoma.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Although {{the causes}} of the {{worldwide}} resurgence of tuberculosis are multifactorial, the HIV epidemic is believed to have had a central role. Control is further threatened by the emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. METHODS [...] A retrospective evaluation was undertaken of trends in pulmonary and extrapulmonary culture positive mycobacterial pathology, and the prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis in both <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> and, presumptively, <b>HIV</b> seronegative patients receiving their clinical care at St Mary's Hospital, London. Five hundred and thirty eight patients (188 of whom were known to be <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive)</b> with positive mycobacterial isolates between January 1987 and March 1993 were identified from laboratory records. These were cross referenced with drug surveillance records. RESULTS [...] Overall, between 1987 and 1992 there was a progressive 3. 5 fold increase in positive mycobacterial isolates and a 2. 5 fold increase in patients with proven mycobacterial infection. This increase was greater within the <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> population. A total of 663 positive mycobacterial isolates was evaluated; the major pathogen identified was Mycobacterium tuberculosis (379 isolates, 57 %). Three hundred and fourteen patients were diagnosed as having M tuberculosis, 49 of whom were <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive.</b> M tuberculosis was predominantly isolated from the lung. Of 358 positive cultures for M tuberculosis (68 <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive,</b> 290 presumptively <b>HIV</b> seronegative), only 27 isolates (7. 6 %), almost exclusively derived from presumed HIV seronegative patients, were resistant to either isoniazid, rifampicin, or both drugs together. No increases in drug-resistant isolates were observed over this period. CONCLUSIONS [...] There has been a considerable increase in the incidence of tuberculosis in both <b>HIV</b> seronegative and <b>seropositive</b> populations during the study period. The emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis was not observed...|$|R
40|$|Background & objective: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} on the prevalence of malaria as co-infectionamongst ‘asymptomatic HIV’ and ‘symptomatic HIV’ subjects to see if such prevalence deviatedfrom that commonly reported in apparently health individuals in same locality. Methods: A prospective study that involved 196 participants grouped according to their HIV statusas: ‘asymptomatic <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> group’ (n = 101); ‘symptomatic <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> group’ (n = 48) and ‘control HIV-seronegative group (n = 47). Blood samples collected from the participantswere used for double HIV screening by rapid immunoassay technique and immunochromatographictechnique, and for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria using rapid P. falciparum antigendetection method. Results: The result showed that the prevalence of P. falciparum malaria as a co-infection amongst theasymptomatic <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> group was 12 (11. 8 %) and amongst the symptomatic HIV seropositivegroup was 16 (33. 3 %). However, the prevalence rate of P. falciparum malaria amongst the controlHIV seronegative group was 5 (10. 6 %) and the combined burden of P. falciparum malaria amongstboth groups of <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositives</b> was 28 (18. 9 %). Interpretation & conclusion: The present study observed different prevalence rates of P. falciparummalaria amongst the three groups. The prevalence was tripled in symptomatic <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> group. This shows a clear departure from possible obtainable prevalence of malaria infection alone in thismalaria endemic area. Due to the mortality rates associated with malaria infection in an endemicarea, it may be necessary that routine malaria screening be adopted as part of the management policyto check the co-infection...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} among 109 children admitted in paediatric wards at Muhimbili 	Medical Centre. 	Amongst them,. there were 62 <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> and 47 <b>HIV</b> seronegative. The main objective was to study the prevalence of ocular manifestations of HIV in African children. The {{results indicated that the}} prevalence of ocular manifestations was 38 % in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> children as compared to 25 % in HIV seronegative children. The lesions of the conjunctiva were common in both groups, while corneal and fundus lesions were more prevalent in HIV positive children. Conjunctival xerosis was a common finding, in both groups of children, indicating poor nutritional status rather than HIV infection. Corneal lesions were more prevalent in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> children than in HIV seronegative children. Fundus lesions were markedly high in HIV seropositi~e children as compared seronegative children. Common lesions were macular edema, haemorrhages and sheathing of the vessels. These findings suggested that the incidence of retinal involvement was high in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> children. 111 In <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> children the prevalence of abnormal visual acuity was 10 % as compared to 6 % in HIV seronegative children, indicating that it was not significantly associated with in HIV positivity. In conclusion, the prevalence of ocular manifestations in African children is high, probably due to the poor nutritional status of the children. In non ocular manifestation, pulmonary tuberculosis was the most frequent diagnosis. Children with systemic diagnosis of tuberculosis, or any other opportunistic infection should be screened for HIV and ocular examination should be performed giving special attention to anterior segment and the fundus...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cryptosporidium parvum, the {{protozoan}} parasite, {{causes a}} significant enteric disease in immunocompromised hosts such as HIV patients. The {{present study was}} aimed to compare serum IgG, IgM and IgA responses to crude soluble antigen of C. parvum in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> and seronegative patients co-infected with Cryptosporidium and to correlate the responses with symptomatology. Methods Cryptosporidium parvum specific serum antibody (IgG, IgM and IgA) responses were assessed by ELISA in 11 <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> Cryptosporidium positive (Group I), 20 <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> Cryptosporidium negative (Group II), 10 HIV seronegative Cryptosporidium positive (Group III), 20 HIV seronegative Cryptosporidium negative healthy individuals (Group IV) and 25 patients with other parasitic diseases (Group V). Results A positive IgG and IgA antibody response was observed in significantly higher number of Cryptosporidium infected individuals (Gp I and III) compared to Cryptosporidium un-infected individuals (Gp II, IV and V) irrespective of HIV/immune status. Sensitivity of IgG ELISA in our study {{was found to be}} higher as compared to IgM and IgA ELISA. The number of patients with positive IgG, IgM and IgA response was not significantly different in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> Cryptosporidium positive patients with diarrhoea when compared to patients without diarrhoea and in patients with CD 4 counts 200 cells/μl. Conclusion The study showed specific serum IgG and IgA production in patients infected with Cryptosporidium, both <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> and seronegative as compared to uninfected subjects suggesting induction of Cryptosporidium specific humoral immune response in infected subjects. However, {{there was no difference in}} number of patients with positive response in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> or seronegative groups indicating that HIV status may not be playing significant role in modulation of Cryptosporidium specific antibody responses. The number of patients with positive IgG, IgM and IgA response was not significantly different in patients with or without history of diarrhoea thereby indicating that Cryptosporidium specific antibody responses may not be necessarily associated with protection from symptomatology. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: There is high {{prevalence}} of tuberculosis {{in patients with}} HIV infection; hence the role of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in HIV patients has always been undermined. NTM {{may be responsible for}} clinical disease in a substantial number of immuno-compromised HIV sero-positive individuals even in a country endemic for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). The study was designed to look for the contribution of NTM to morbidity in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> patients. Material and Methods: In a prospective study of ninety-four <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> individuals presenting with pulmonary or extra-pulmonary symptoms suggestive of mycobacterial infection, appropriate samples were collected and processed. Detailed clinical history was utilized to differentiate colonization or contamination by NTM from true lung disease. Results: Fourteen samples grew mycobacterial species, 8 (57. 2 %) being NTM. The distribution of NTM was- 3 M. avium complex, 2 M. fortuitum, 2 M. vaccae, 1 M. phlei. 6 isolates were M. tuberculosis. Conclusion: NTM may be responsible for a significant proportion of mycobacterial infections in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> individuals. Despite the high endemicity of tuberculosis in developing countries like India, the presence of NTM should be ruled out; especially in immuno-compromised <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> individuals before instituting anti-tubercular therapy empirically. In addition, non-response of NTM to ATT may be wrongly attributed to multi-drug resistant tuberculosis...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Concentrations of glutathione, a {{ubiquitous}} tripeptide with immune enhancing and antioxidant properties, are {{decreased in}} the blood and lung epithelial lining fluid of human immunodeficiency virus (<b>HIV)</b> <b>seropositive</b> individuals. Since the lung {{is the most common}} site of infection in those who progress to AIDS it is rational to consider whether it is possible to safely augment glutathione levels in the epithelial lining fluid of <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> individuals, thus potentially improving local host defence. METHODS [...] Purified reduced glutathione was delivered by aerosol to <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> individuals (n = 14) and the glutathione levels in lung epithelial lining fluid were compared before and at one, two, and three hours after aerosol administration. RESULTS [...] Before treatment total glutathione concentrations in the epithelial lining fluid were approximately 60 % of controls. After three days of twice daily doses each of 600 mg reduced glutathione, total glutathione levels in the epithelial lining fluid increased and remained in the normal range for at least three hours after treatment. Strikingly, even though > 95 % of the glutathione in the aerosol was in its reduced form, the percentage of oxidised glutathione in epithelial lining fluid increased from 5 % before treatment to about 40 % three hours after treatment, probably reflecting the use of glutathione as an antioxidant in vivo. No adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS [...] It is feasible and safe to use aerosolised reduced glutathione to augment the deficient glutathione levels of the lower respiratory tract of <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> individuals. It is rational to evaluate further the efficacy of this tripeptide in improving host defence in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> individuals...|$|R

Also {{available by}} subscription via World Wide Webix, 28 leaves, bound 29 cmBackground: In normal elderly individuals (age greater than 65 years) presence of brain white matter hyperintensities {{is associated with}} cortical atrophy, particularly of the frontal lobes. As HIV-seropositive individuals experience increase longevity due to {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} it is likely they will also develop typical aging related changes in brain structure such as white matter hyperintensities. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the relationship between white matter hyperintensities and brain cortical gray matter volumes in human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (<b>HIV)</b> <b>seropositive</b> individuals. Methods: Voxel-based-morphometry was used to compare cortical gray matter volumes between 62 <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> participants in the Hawaii Aging with HIV cohort study, 30 with moderate brain white matter hyperintensities and 32 with minimal or no white matter hyperintensities. The Hawaii Aging with HIV Cohort study included two groups of <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> individuals, an older group comprised of individuals with age greater than 50 years old, and a younger group comprised of individuals with age from 20 - 39 years old. Results: Presence of moderate brain white matter hyperintensities was associated with decreased cortical gray matter volumes in the frontal lobes bilaterally (p < 0. 05) in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> individuals. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that presence of moderate brain white matter hyperintensities is associated with frontal lobe cortical atrophy in <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> individuals. These results are supportive of the hypothesis iv that the frontal lobes have greater susceptibility to the effects of small vessel ischemic vascular disease than other brain regions...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} of homosexual and bisexual men in Brisbane to establish whether {{knowledge of their}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -antibody status had influenced any sexual behaviour that was likely to spread HIV type 1 (HIV- 1). Of the 318 respondents, 123 respondents knew their HIV serological status, and 13 of these were <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive.</b> Of the 195 respondents who previously had not been tested, 10 individuals proved to be <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive.</b> Eighty-two per cent of subjects stated that they had reduced their sexual activity because of their awareness of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); this reduction was equally common among those who had or had not previously had their HIV serological status checked. Anal intercourse was practised most frequently by those subjects who were <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> and {{were not aware of}} it; nevertheless, unprotected anal intercourse was common among subjects who knew their HIV serological status, including those who knew that they were <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive.</b> Eighty-nine of 208 subjects who were practising anal intercourse had never used a condom. Usage of a condom was marginally more common among those subjects who previously had been tested for the presence of HIV antibodies (P = 0. 06), and this was particularly so for those subjects who knew that they were <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> (P < 0. 01). Condom usage was no more common among those subjects who knew that they were HIV seronegative, when compared with those subjects who did not know their status. These data show that knowledge of a negative HIV-antibody test-result has no substantial association with safer sexual behaviour and suggest that whereas targeted information programmes have had some impact on behaviour in high-risk groups in Brisbane, by the end of July 1986, these programmes had not yet resulted in safer sexual practices by the majority of homosexual and bisexual men...|$|R

The study aimed to evaluate the levels of thyroid hormones, CD 4 + T cells, body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure of <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> subjects in Nkpor, Anambra State, South East Nigeria. A total of one hundred and fifty subjects were investigated; 50 <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> subjects who were not on antiretroviral therapy (ART), 50 HIV infected subjects who were on ART and 50 apparently healthy non HIV subjects (control). Thyroid hormones Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), tri-iodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4) were assayed using Enzyme immunoassay kits (Diagnostic Automation), CD 4 +Tcells were determined using flow cytometry. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from the height and weight of the subjects which have been measured using standard procedures. The results showed that the levels of thyroid hormones and systolic blood pressure of <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> subjects on ART showed significant increases when compared with <b>HIV</b> <b>seropositive</b> subjects not on ART and the control subjects.
