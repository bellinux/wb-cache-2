5|$|Because of his father's {{success in}} {{business}} and his mother's descent from Hawaiian royalty, the Pitman family was considered quite prosperous and were host to the royal family when they visited Hilo. Besides {{being one of the}} leading merchants in town, his father also served the government as district magistrate of Hilo. Henry's mother, Kinoʻole, had inherited control over much of the lands in Hilo and Ōlaʻa from <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>father,</b> and King Kamehameha III had granted her use of the ahupuaʻa of Hilo after her marriage. During Henry's early childhood, the family lived in the mansion that Benjamin Pitman had built in 1840, in an area known as Niopola, one of the favored resort spots of ancient Hawaiian royalty. The residence also became known as the Spencer House after Pitman sold it to his business partner Captain Thomas Spencer. The property later became the site of the Hilo Hotel, built in 1888 and torn down in 1956. In the 1850s the family moved to the capital of Honolulu where Benjamin Pitman took up banking and built a beautiful two-story house that he named Waialeale ("rippling water") at the corner of Alakea and Beretania Streets.|$|E

25|$|According to Sigmund Freud, {{being unable}} to accept the illness of her child, Victoria ended up {{distancing}} herself from her first-born, which made {{a great impact on}} the behaviour of the future William II. However, other authors, such as the historian Wolfgang Mommsen, insist that the Crown Princess was very affectionate with her children. According to him, Vicky wanted her children to be like the idealised figure of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>father</b> and tried, as best she could, to follow the educational precepts of Prince Albert. In 1863, Victoria and Frederick bought a cottage in Bornstedt so that their children could grow up in an environment similar to that of Osborne House. However, Victoria's influence on her offspring had an important limitation: like all the Hohenzollerns, her sons received a military training from a very young age, and the Crown Princess feared that such education would undermine their values.|$|E
25|$|Shirley Veronica Bassey was {{the sixth}} and {{youngest}} child of Henry Bassey and Eliza Jane Start, and was born on Bute Street in Tiger Bay (Butetown), Cardiff, Wales.

Her father was Nigerian, and her mother was English, from Teesside in the north-east of England. Two of her mother's four children from previous relationships lived in the Bassey household. Bassey's mother listed her first husband, Alfred Metcalfe, as <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>father</b> in the registry of her marriage to Henry Bassey, giving rise to speculation that this marriage was bigamous {{in the absence of a}} prior divorce.

25|$|In the {{following}} years, the family kept growing. A {{daughter was born}} on 29 October 1875 at Eastwell Park. She was named Marie, after her mother and grandmother. Maria shocked English society by nursing the children herself. The family's main residence in England was Clarence House, in London. Autumns, Christmas and new year were spent at Eastwell Park, a country estate they leased in Kent. On summer holidays, the family went to Osborne Cottage on the Isle of Wight. While the Duchess was in Malta with her husband, who was stationed there as {{an officer in the}} Royal Navy, Maria Alexandrovna gave birth to a second daughter, Victoria Melita, on 25 November 1876. After their return to their sojourn in Malta, in 1877, Russia went to war with Turkey in an attempt to gain control of the Balkans. Queen Victoria sent Tsar Alexander II a series of aggressive telegrams that almost led to a state of war between the two countries. The Duchess was deeply shocked at her mother-in-law's hostility towards her country and <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>father</b> in particular.

25|$|This temple is {{one among}} the 51 Shakti peethas {{located on the}} Indian subcontinent and is a {{location}} where one of Sati's limbs, her right arm is considered to have fallen when grief-stricken and agitated Shiva was carrying her dead body round the world on his shoulders, and Vishnu had cut her body into pieces with his Sudarshana Chakra. The story behind this event is that King Prajapati Daksha, father of Sati (the first wife of Lord Shiva), was performing a yagna (yagna {{is defined as a}} Hindu fire ritual sacrifice when deities of the Vedic times like Agni, the fire god, and others were invoked by offering oblations such as ghee (clarified butter), milk, grains and so forth) called as Brihaspatirao. Sati (also called Shakti) who was Lord Shiva's wife, attended the function without invitation. Daksha who was not fond of his son-in-law, as he considered him a mendicant, purposely did not invite him for the yagna, while he invited all other gods. Sati felt deeply insulted by the slight shown by her father towards her husband whom she had married out of deep love. Even then she decided to attend the yagna uninvited by <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>father.</b> When she went there, her father compounded the insult by totally ignoring her presence and vilifying Shiva. Sati felt deeply humiliated and hurt, and then in frustration she jumped into the yagna fire and committed suicide. When this news was conveyed to Shiva, first he sent his assistant to the site to enquire and take revenge. Shiva also came to the yagna site and created a furor. In a state of grief and anger he put Sati's dead body on his shoulders and started wandering round the universe. Looking at this grave situation, Brahma and Vishnu decided to intervene and bring back Shiva to his normal self. It was then decided that Vishnu will follow behind Shiva, and with his Sudarsha Chakra cut Sati's dead body into pieces. Thus Vishnu cut her into 51 pieces (108 pieces are also mentioned in many Puranic texts) as Shiva traveled around the world and these fifty one body parts of Sati fell at different locations in the subcontinent, and all these places {{came to be known as}} Shakthi Peethas (abode of goddess Shakthi or Durga). Her right arm fell on the Saptashrungi hills and the place became holy, and a Shakthi Peeth came to be established here.|$|E
