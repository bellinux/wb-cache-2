5|$|Two more <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> {{bombs were}} detonated during the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946. Some 120 <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> units were {{produced}} between 1947 and 1949, {{when it was}} superseded by the Mark 4 nuclear bomb. The <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> was retired in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Los Alamos's Thin Man and <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> code {{names were}} {{adopted by the}} USAAF for the weapons.

5|$|The <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> and Pumpkin bombs (non-nuclear {{bombs that}} resembled and handled like <b>Fat</b> <b>Man)</b> weighed over , so weight was a concern, {{even with the}} more {{powerful}} engines. Weight reduction was accomplished by removal of all gun turrets and armor plating. This work {{was done by the}} 509th Composite Group for the early Silverplate aircraft, but later models were delivered without them. These B-29s represented a significant increase in performance over the standard variants.|$|E

5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory and the Army Air Forces {{had already}} {{commenced}} work on improving the design. The North American B-45 Tornado, Convair XB-46, Martin XB-48, and Boeing B-47 Stratojet bombers, {{then on the}} drawing boards, had bomb bays sized to carry the Grand Slam, which was much longer but not {{as wide as the}} <b>Fat</b> <b>Man.</b> The only American bombers that could carry the <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> were the B-29 and the Convair B-36. In November 1945, the Army Air Forces asked Los Alamos for 200 <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> bombs. At the time there were only two sets of plutonium cores and high-explosive assemblies. The Army Air Forces wanted improvements to the design {{to make it easier to}} manufacture, assemble, handle, transport, and stockpile. The wartime Project W-47 was continued, and drop tests resumed in January 1946.|$|E
5|$|Assembly of a <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> {{unit was}} a complex {{operation}} involving personnel from the HE-ME, Pit, Fusing and Firing teams. To prevent the assembly building from becoming overcrowded and thereby causing an accident, Parsons limited the numbers allowed inside at any time. Personnel waiting {{to perform a}} specific task had to wait their turn outside the building. The first <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> assembly, known as F13, was assembled by 31 July, and expended in a drop test the next day. This was followed by F18 on 4 August, which was dropped the next day. Three sets of <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> high explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, arrived on a B-29 of the 509th Composite Group and 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit on 2 August. On inspection, the high explosive blocks of F32 {{were found to be}} badly cracked and unserviceable. The other two were assembled, with F33 earmarked for a rehearsal and F31 for operational use.|$|E

5|$|The 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Special) {{constructed}} prototype {{atomic weapons}} (without nuclear material) and drop tested them. Little {{was known about}} the flight characteristics of the prototype atom bomb designs and how the fusing mechanism would work. In February 1945, a Flight Test Section was created within the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit to carry out testing with prototype bombs {{in the shape of}} the Little Boy and <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> bombs. It was originally equipped with five Silverplate B-29s, three flight crews and five maintenance crews. To help out with an increasingly demanding schedule, four crews from the 393d Bombardment Squadron were made available. The Flight Test Section carried out 24 drop tests in June and 30 in July. About two thirds of the June tests were with <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> shapes and the rest with Little Boy ones. In July, all but four of the tests were with <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> shapes, some with explosive-filled Pumpkin bombs. Test drops were carried out at Wendover, at the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, and at the Salton Sea Naval Auxiliary Air Station. Testing continued up to the last minute, with the <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> firing unit, known as the X-unit, only being successfully tested at Wendover on 4 August, and a final test of the X-unit was carried out six days later.|$|E
5|$|The rest of Project Alberta {{departed}} for Tinian following the {{successful completion of}} the Trinity test on 16 July. The remainder of the Little Boy assembly team arrived on 22 July, followed by Parsons, Ashworth, Purnell, Farrell and {{the remainder of the}} <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> assembly, Pit, Observation and Firing teams. The whole of Project Alberta was assembled on Tinian by 25 July, except for members who were couriers for bomb parts. Nolan arrived on 26 July on the cruiser , along with Major Robert Furman and Captain Charles H. O'Brien of the 1st Technical Services Detachment, with the Little Boy assembly and active material. Jesse Kupferberg and Raemer Schreiber arrived by C-54 with the remainder of the Little Boy active material and the plutonium <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> pit.|$|E
5|$|While many Manhattan {{scientists}} {{expected that}} the development of the means of delivery of the atomic bomb would be straightforward, Parsons, with his experience of the proximity fuze program, expected that it would involve considerable effort. The test program was initiated on 13 August 1943 at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia, where a scale model of the <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> plutonium bomb was developed. On 3 March 1944, testing moved to Muroc Army Air Field, California. The initial tests demonstrated that the <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> assembly was unstable in flight, and that its fuzes did not work properly.|$|E

5|$|As {{little as}} 15lb (7kg) of {{uranium-235}} {{can be used}} to make an atomic bomb. The first nuclear bomb used in war, Little Boy, relied on uranium fission, but the very first nuclear explosive (the Gadget used at Trinity) and the bomb that destroyed Nagasaki (<b>Fat</b> <b>Man)</b> were both plutonium bombs.|$|E
5|$|From 1956 to 1976, the 102d was {{commanded}} by Brigadier General Charles W.

While at Berkeley, Segrè helped discover the element astatine and the isotope plutonium-239, which was later used to make the <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> nuclear bomb dropped on Nagasaki.|$|E

5|$|The Mark III Mod 0 <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> {{was ordered}} {{to be put into}} {{production}} in mid-1946. High explosives were manufactured by the Salt Wells Pilot Plant, which had been established by the Manhattan Project as part of Project Camel. A new plant was established at the Iowa Army Ordnance Plant. Mechanical components were made or procured by the Rock Island Arsenal. Electrical and mechanical components for about 50 bombs were stockpiled at Kirtland Army Air Field by August 1946, but only nine plutonium cores were available. Production of the Mod 0 ended in December 1948, by which time there were still only 53 cores available. It was replaced by improved versions, known as Mods 1 and 2, which contained a number of minor changes, the most important of which was that they did not charge the X-Unit firing system's capacitors until released from the aircraft. The Mod 0s were withdrawn from service between March and July 1949, and by October they had all been rebuilt as Mods 1 and 2. Some 120 Mark III <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> units were added to the stockpile between 1947 and 1949, when it was superseded by the Mark 4 nuclear bomb. The Mark III <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> was retired in 1950.|$|E
