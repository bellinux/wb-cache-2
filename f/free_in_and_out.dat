We show that RGP is not a particular case of AWP, although many properties of these models are almost identical in the quasistable regime. We discuss some features of AWP distinguishing it from RGP.

40|$|I call {{attention}} to the possibility that QCD bound states (hadrons) could be derived using rigorous Hamiltonian, perturbative methods. Solving Gauss' law for A^ 0 with a non-vanishing boundary condition at spatial infinity gives an α_s^ 0 linear potential for color singlet qq̅ and qqq states. These states are Poincaré and gauge covariant and thus can serve as initial states of a perturbative expansion, replacing the conventional <b>free</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> states. The coupling freezes at α_s(0) ≃ 0. 5, allowing reasonable convergence. The α_s^ 0 bound states have a sea of qq̅ pairs, while transverse gluons contribute only at α_s. Pair creation in the linear A^ 0 potential leads to string breaking and hadron loop corrections. These corrections give finite widths to excited states, as required by unitarity. Several of these features have been verified analytically in D= 1 + 1 dimensions, and some in D= 3 + 1. Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures.

40|$|In {{this article}} I show why the {{fundamental}} constants obtain perturbative corrections in higher orders, why the renormalizations work {{and how to}} reformulate the theory {{in order to avoid}} these technical and conceptual complications. I demonstrate that the perturbative mass and charge corrections are caused exclusively with the kinetic nature of the interaction Lagrangian. As soon as it is not purely quantum mechanical (or QFT) specific feature, the problem can be demonstrated on a classical two-body problem. The latter can be solved in different ways, one of them being correct and good for applying the perturbation theory (if necessary) and another one being tricky and awkward. The first one is physically and technically natural - it is a center-of-inertia-and-relative-variable formulation. The second one - mixed variable formulation - is unnecessarily complicated and leads to the mass and charge corrections even in the Newtonian mechanics of two bound bodies. The perturbation theory in QFT is factually formulated in the mixed variables - that is why it brings corrections to the fundamental constants. This understanding opens a way of correctly formulating the QFT equations and thus to simplify the QFT calculations technically and conceptually. For example, in scattering problems in QED it means accounting exactly the quantized electromagnetic field influence in the <b>free</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> states of charged particles so no infrared and ultraviolet problems arise. In bound states it means obtaining the energy corrections (the Lamb shift, the anomalous magnetic moment) quite straightforwardly and without renormalizations.

As a result, the dynamical group of evolution splits into two semi-groups. Moreover, the laws of classical dynamics take a new form as they have to be formulated on the statistical level. They express ‘possibilities’ and no more ‘certitudes’. The reason for the new features is the appearance of new, non-Newtonian effects due to Poincaré resonances. The resonances couple dynamical events and lead to ‘collision operators’ (such as the Fokker-Planck operator) well-known from various phenomenological approaches to non-equilibrium physics. These ‘collision operators’ represent diffusive processes and mark the breakdown of the deterministic description which was always associated with classical mechanics. ‘Subdynamics’ as discussed in previous publications, is derived from the spectral representation. The eigenfunctions of the Liouville operator have remarkable properties as they lead to long-range correlations due to resonances even if the interactions as included in the Hamiltonian are short-range (only equilibrium correlations remain short-range). This is in agreement with the results of non-equilibrium thermodynamics as the appearance of dissipative structures is connected to long-range correlations. In agreement with previous results, it is shown that there exists an intertwining relation between LH and the collision operator Θ as defined in the text. Both have the same eigenvalues and are connected by a non-unitary similitude ΛLHΛ− 1 = Θ. The various forms of Λ and their symmetry properties are discussed. A consequence of the intertwining relation are ‘non-linear Lippmann-Schwinger’ equations which reduce to the classical linear Lippmann-Schwinger equations when the dissipative effects due to the Poincaré resonances can be neglected. Using the transformation operator Λ, we can define new distribution functions and new observables whose evolution equations take a specially simple form (they are ‘bloc diagonalized’). Dynamics is transformed in an infinite set of kinetic equations. Starting with these equations, we can derive H-functions which present a monotonous time behavior and reach their minimum at equilibrium. This requires no extra-dynamical assumptions (such as coarse graining, environment effects …). Moreover, our formulation is valid for strong coupling (beyond the so-called Van Hove's λ 2 t limit). We then study the conditions under which our new non-Newtonian effects are observable. For a finite number N of particles and transient interactions (such as realized in the usual scattering experiments) we recover traditional trajectory theory. To observe our new effects we need persistent interactions associated to singular distribution functions. We have studied in detail two examples, both analytically and by computer simulations. These examples are persistent scattering in which test particles are continuously interacting with a scattering center, and the Lorentz model in which a ‘light’ particle is scattered by a large number of ‘heavy’ particles. The agreement between our theoretical predictions and the numerical simulations is excellent. The new results are also essential in the thermodynamic limit as introduced in statistical mechanics. We recover also, the results of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics obtained by various phenomenological approximations. Of special interest is the domain of validity of the trajectory description as a trajectory is traditionally considered as a primitive, irreducible concept. In the Liouville description the natural variables are wave vectors k which are constants in free motion and modified by interactions and resonances. A trajectory can be considered as a coherent superposition of plane waves corresponding to wave vectors k. Resonances correspond to non-local processes in space-time. They threaten therefore the persistence of trajectories. In fact, we show that whenever the thermodynamic limit exists, trajectories are destroyed and transformed into singular distribution functions. We have a ‘collapse’ of trajectories, to borrow the terminology from quantum mechanics. The trajectory becomes a stochastic object as in Brownian motion theory. In conclusion, we obtain a unified formulation of dynamics and of thermodynamics. This involves the introduction of LPS which leads to dissipation together with the consideration of delocalized situations. From this point of view, there is a strong analogy with phase transitions which are also defined in the thermodynamic limit. Irreversibility is, in this sense, an ‘emergent’ property which could not be included in classical dynamics as long as its study was limited to local, transient situations. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedSpecial issue :Time symmetry breaking in classical and quantum mechanic...|$|E
