5|$|It was in {{this manner}} that Fortune and Loveday claimed that they {{received}} a text, The Cosmic Doctrine, which was dictated to them in segments by the Masters between July 1923 and February 1925. These communications discussed the existence of seven planes of the universe, and were {{very similar to the}} ideas promoted in Moriarty's writings, in particular his Aphorism of Creation and Cosmic Principles. The cosmology present in this book was also similar to that presented in Theosophy. In the following years, Fortune distributed this material among her senior students, before publishing an edited version of The Cosmic <b>Doctrine</b> <b>in</b> 1949.|$|E
5|$|Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm {{served as}} the {{flagship}} of the Imperial fleet from her commissioning in 1894 until 1900. She saw limited active duty during her service career with the German fleet due to the relatively peaceful nature of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a result, her career focused on training exercises and goodwill visits to foreign ports. These training maneuvers were nevertheless very important to developing German naval tactical <b>doctrine</b> <b>in</b> the two decades before World War I, especially {{under the direction of}} Alfred von Tirpitz. She, along with her three sisters, saw only one major overseas deployment, to China in 1900–01, during the Boxer Rebellion. The ship underwent a major modernization in 1904–05.|$|E

5|$|Lucas v.

5|$|Nri's hegemony {{over much}} of Igboland lasted from the reigns of the fourth eze Nri {{to that of the}} ninth. After that, {{patterns}} of conflict emerged that existed from the tenth to the fourteenth reigns, which probably reflected the monetary importance of the slave trade. Outside-world influence {{was not going to be}} halted by native religious <b>doctrine</b> <b>in</b> the face of the slave trade's economic opportunities. Nri hegemony declined after the start of the 18th century. Still, it survived in a much-reduced, and weakened form until 1911. In 1911, British troops forced the reigning eze Nri to renounce the ritual power of the religion known as the ìkénga, ending the kingdom of Nri as a political power.|$|E
5|$|The cy-près <b>doctrine</b> <b>in</b> English law is {{an element}} of trusts law dealing with {{charitable}} trusts. The doctrine provides that when such a trust has failed because its purposes are either impossible or cannot be fulfilled, the High Court of Justice or Charity Commission can make an order redirecting the trust's funds to the nearest possible purpose. For charities with a worth under £5,000 and no land, the trustees (by a two-thirds majority) may make the decision to redirect the trust's funds. The doctrine was initially an element of ecclesiastical law, coming from the Norman French cy près comme possible (as close as possible), but similar and possibly ancestral provisions have been found in Roman law, both in the Corpus Juris Civilis and later Byzantine law.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} an {{individual}} – signified by the tolling of the bell – is thus a treasure buried {{at the bottom of}} a mine: only of value if it is given to someone who makes good use of it. In this he refers to the work of Augustine of Hippo, specifically On Christian <b>Doctrine,</b> <b>in</b> which Augustine describes the knowledge of pagans as gold and silver: something that can be involved in Christian purposes if appropriated properly. Donne, twisting this idea, is arguing that the {{death of an}}y individual is something others can learn from, should they understand it properly.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} of the Battle of the Somme led the German command {{to conclude that the}} policy of rigidly defending a trench position line was no longer effective against the firepower that the Entente armies had accumulated. Ludendorff published a new defensive <b>doctrine</b> <b>in</b> December 1916, in which deeper defences were to be built, within which the garrison would have room to manoeuvre, rather than rigidly holding successive lines of trenches. Along Vimy Ridge, the German forces spent two years constructing fortifications designed for rigid defence. Little reconstruction based upon the new defence-in-depth doctrine had been accomplished by April 1917 because the terrain made it impractical.|$|E
5|$|There was broad {{agreement}} between Taft and Knox on major foreign policy goals; the U.S. would not interfere in European affairs, and would use force {{if necessary to}} enforce the Monroe <b>Doctrine</b> <b>in</b> the Americas. The defense of the Panama Canal, which was under construction throughout Taft's term (it opened in 1914), guided United States {{foreign policy in the}} Caribbean and Central America. Previous administrations had made efforts to promote American business interests overseas, but Taft went a step further and used the web of American diplomats and consuls abroad to further trade. Such ties, Taft hoped, would promote world peace. Taft pushed for arbitration treaties with Great Britain and France, but the Senate was not willing to yield its constitutional prerogative to approve treaties to arbitrators.|$|E

However, as the hostility between the East and West developed into the Cold War, especially after the issuing of the Truman <b>Doctrine</b> <b>in</b> 1947, Turkey strengthened its ties with the West. The Soviet Union relinquished its claims over the lost territories, understanding that the newly formed NATO would intervene on Turkey's side {{in the event of a}} conflict.|$|E
