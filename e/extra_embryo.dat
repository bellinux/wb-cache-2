40|$|MiRNAs (microRNAs) play {{critical}} {{roles in}} many important biological {{processes such as}} growth and development in mammals. In this study, we identified hundreds of porcine miRNA candidates through in silico prediction and analyzed their expression in developing skeletal muscle using microarray. Microarray screening using RNA samples prepared from a 33 -day whole embryo and an <b>extra</b> <b>embryo</b> membrane validated 296 of the predicted candidates. Comparative expression profiling across samples of longissimus muscle collected from 33 -day and 65 -day post-gestation fetuses, as well as adult pigs, identified 140 differentially expressed miRNAs amongst the age groups investigated. The differentially expressed miRNAs showed seven distinctive types of expression patterns, suggesting possible involvement in certain biological processes. Five of the differentially expressed miRNAs were validated using real-time PCR. In silico analysis of the miRNA-mRNA interaction sites suggested that the potential mRNA targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs may play important roles in muscl...|$|E

2500|$|If IVF were {{to involve}} the {{fertilisation}} of only a single egg, or at least only the number that will be implanted, then {{this would not be}} an issue. However, this has the chance of increasing costs dramatically as only a few eggs can be attempted at a time. [...] As a result, the couple must {{decide what to do with}} these <b>extra</b> <b>embryos.</b> Depending on their view of the embryo’s humanity or the chance the couple will want to try to have another child, the couple has multiple options for dealing with these <b>extra</b> <b>embryos.</b> Couples can choose to keep them frozen, donate them to other infertile couples, thaw them, or donate them to medical research. Keeping them frozen costs money, donating them does not ensure they will survive, thawing them renders them immediately unviable, and medical research results in their termination. In the realm of medical research, the couple is not necessarily told what the embryos will be used for, and as a result, some can be used in stem cell research, a field perceived to have ethical issues.|$|R
40|$|Multiple birth, {{which is}} {{associated}} with adverse fetal, infant, and maternal outcomes, is increasingly related {{to the use of}} in vitro fertilization (IVF). Among women undergoing IVF who use their own eggs, greater maternal age {{is associated with}} decreased risk of multiple birth; using donor eggs from younger women may negate this age effect. Data from 6, 936 IVF procedures performed in the United States in 1996 – 1997 on women aged 35 – 54 years who used donor eggs were analyzed to assess the effect of maternal age, number of embryos transferred, and cryopreservation of <b>extra,</b> nontransferred <b>embryos</b> (an indicator of higher embryo quality) on risk of multiple birth. Greater maternal age did not decrease multiple-birth risk. Rates of multiple birth were related to number of embryos transferred and whether <b>extra</b> <b>embryos</b> had been cryopreserved, and they were high compared with those of IVF patients the same age who had used their own eggs. Among women who had <b>extra</b> <b>embryos</b> cryopreserved, transferring more than two embryos increased multiple-birth risk, with no corresponding increase in the chance for a livebirth. These results highlight the need to consider the age of the donor and embryo quality when making embryo transfer decisions involving use of donor eggs.

50|$|Embryo {{donation}} {{is where}} <b>extra</b> <b>embryos</b> from a successful IVF {{of a couple}} are given to other couples or women for transfer {{with the goal of}} producing a successful pregnancy. Embryos for embryo donation may also be created specifically for embryo transfer using donor eggs and sperm, or in some cases donor eggs and donor sperm. It may thus be seen as a combination of sperm donation and egg donation, since what is donated is a combination of these. Such embryos may also be donated to a 'commissioning' woman or a 'commissioning' couple and gestated by a surrogate where, for example, the 'commissioning' woman or the woman of the 'commissioning' couple is infertile and is unable to bring a pregnancy to full term on medical grounds, or is unwilling for social, medical or other reasons, to do so.|$|R
40|$|The {{battle for}} the future of {{assisted}} reproduction technologies (ART) has been joined. The tacit compromise underlying assisted reproduction - no laws are passed that even tangentially sanction embryo destruction and no laws are passed that intrude on the profitability of fertility treatments - may be coming to an end. As use of ART has increased, so have calls for supervision and oversight. In the wake of 2 ̆ 2 Octomom 2 ̆ 2 Nadya Suleman 2 ̆ 7 s use of in vitro fertilization (IVF) to give birth to octuplets, the calls to regulate assisted reproduction have become even more pressing. At the same time, religious communities ambivalent about ART have increased the calls to reform ART practices to bring them more in line with religious teachings and spiritually informed notions of human dignity. In this paper, we focus on what may become a new flash point in the effort to craft normative understandings about assisted reproduction. That flash point is the treatment of {{the hundreds of thousands of}} <b>extra</b> <b>embryos</b> created through in vitro fertilization (IVF) and the efforts to pass legislation that will recognize these embryos as human beings and facilitate their adoption. We examine the implications of these efforts {{for the future of}} assisted reproduction...|$|R
40|$|Although {{breeding}} system investigations {{were previously}} performed in only {{nine of the}} 100 Tabebuia species, indications of self-incompatibility {{have been found in}} all of them, and the four species studied for the site of incompatibility reaction showed some kind of late-acting self-incompatibility. Polyembryony has been found in T. chrysotricha and T. ochracea, with adventitious origin of the <b>extra</b> <b>embryos</b> being shown in the latter. We investigated the breeding system in five species of Tabebuia by hand-pollination experiments, fluorescence microscopy study of in situ pollen tube growth, and histological analysis of postpollination events. Although both T. chrysotricha and T. heptaphylla developed fruits by self-pollination, polyembryony was verified only in the former, which indicates that self-fertility in Tabebuia is not necessarily associated with apomixis. The remaining species were 100 % self-sterile. Although some penetrated ovules in crossed pistils of T. vellosoi were found at the 48 -h interval, none of the ovules in selfed pistil was penetrated at the same interval, with penetration of many ovules occurring 72 h postpollination. In T. impetiginosa, ovule penetration efficiency 48 h after pollination was higher in cross- than in self-pollinated pistils, and the majority of the ovules in selfed pistils were penetrated and fertilized in 72 h. The incidences of ovule fertilization and endosperm initiation were significantly slower in selfed compared with crossed pistils, and a clear developmental slowdown of the endosperm occurred in selfed pistils before abscission, although no other signs of developmental malfunctions were detected. In all of the self-sterile species, abortion of selfed pistils occurred in a small period after pollination, and no swelling of the ovary was observed in T. umbellata. All of these results agree with the occurrence of late-acting self-incompatibility in T. impetiginosa, T. umbellata, and T. vellosoi, and no evidence was found that self-sterility in these species is due to inbreeding depression...|$|R

40|$|The {{challenges}} before {{science and}} medicine are these: science must explore {{the natural world}} as thoroughly as possible, while still honoring, protecting, serving and preserving the subject of its investigations, and the human beings for whom it is a tool; medicine must confront disease and disability as effectively as possible, while also honoring, protecting, and preserving those beings for whom it serves – all of those beings, not just some, or even most, at the potential expense of others. These goals are challenged by embryo-destructive human embryonic stem cell research. The human embryo {{is a human being}} as clearly defined by embryology, and as such should be protected by the codes governing human subject research. However, because of the “potential” benefits offered by pluripotent stem cells, coupled with abortion politics and a very poorly regulated infertility industry, United States governmental advisory commissions and the scientific, medical, and political communities have attempted to define away the humanity of the human embryo, witha few notable exceptions. Because infertility treatments in the United States are poorly regulated, there are large numbersof supernumerary embryos in cryopreservation. However, only a tiny portion of these will ever be potentially available for research, and thus are not a realistic source of the cells necessary to provide treatments to the millions who might benefit from proposed stem cell based therapies. Cloning willnot be the answer either, given the millions of women who must be exploited to provide sufficient numbers of eggs to generate the cloned cell lines. Moreover, the disposition decisions parents must make for their <b>extra</b> <b>embryos</b> are often agonizing, and not uncommonly change. The use of supernumerary embryos as a source for human embryonic stem cells is unethical, will never be a sufficient source for the medical treatments expected from stem cell research, and is often a source of great distress for the conceiving parents. The United States experience is not a positive model for other countries to emulate...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether patients support a mandatory single blastocyst transfer (mSBT) policy in IVF. DESIGN: Prospective survey study. SETTING: Academic hospital-based infertility center. PATIENT(S) : Two hundred sixty-two female patients presenting for fresh or cryopreserved/thawed ET after IVF. INTERVENTION(S) : Internet-based in-clinic survey after ET. Follow-up at-home survey after pregnancy test results. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Patient {{support for an}} mSBT policy and attitudes regarding patient input into IVF treatment. Logistic regression analyses tested associations among main outcome measures, patient characteristics, and treatment results. RESULT(S) : Ninety-four percent of patients endorsed support for our mSBT policy; 95 % and 87 % felt they had {{the right amount of}} input in their IVF treatment and number of embryos transferred, respectively, and these subjects were more likely to support the mSBT policy. Other factors associated with stronger support were concern for multiples, availability of <b>extra</b> cryopreserved <b>embryos,</b> and shorter duration of infertility. Receiving a single blastocyst during treatment did not change the level of support. A negative pregnancy outcome decreased support, however.

40|$|Exposure to hypoxia causes {{structural}} {{changes in the}} endothelial cell (EC) monolayer that alter its permeability. There was a report earlier of impairment of nitric oxide (NO) production in endothelium. Intervention of NO in the altered cellular arrangements of actin cytoskeleton in endothelium for rectification of paracellular gaps in endothelium under hypoxia was observed. The present study demonstrates hypoxia inducing paracellular gaps in hypoxia exposed blood capillaries in chick <b>embryo</b> <b>extra</b> vascular model. Phalloidin staining confirmed significant polymerization of actin and unique cellular localization of the F-actin bands under hypoxia treatments. Addition of spermine NONOate (SPNO), a NO donor, or reoxygenation to endothelial monolayer attenuated hypoxia-mediated effects on endothelial permeability with partial recovery of endothelial integrity through actin remodeling. The present study indicates link of hypoxia-induced actin-associated cytoskeletal rearrangements and paracellular gaps in the endothelium with a low NO availability in the hypoxia milieu. The author concludes that NO confers protection against hypoxia-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling and endothelial leakiness...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: During IVF, non-transferred embryos {{are usually}} {{selected}} for cryopreservation {{on the basis}} of morphological criteria. This investigation evaluated an application for array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in assessment of surplus embryos prior to cryopreservation. METHODS: First-time IVF patients undergoing elective single embryo transfer and having at least one <b>extra</b> non-transferred <b>embryo</b> suitable for cryopreservation were offered enrollment in the study. Patients were randomized into two groups: Patients in group A (n= 55) had embryos assessed first by morphology and then by aCGH, performed on cells obtained from trophectoderm biopsy on post-fertilization day 5. Only euploid embryos were designated for cryopreservation. Patients in group B (n= 48) had embryos assessed by morphology alone, with only good morphology embryos considered suitable for cryopreservation. RESULTS: Among biopsied embryos in group A (n= 425), euploidy was confirmed in 226 (53. 1 %). After fresh single embryo transfer, 64 (28. 3 %) surplus euploid embryos were cryopreserved for 51 patients (92. 7 %). In group B, 389 good morphology blastocysts were identified and a single top quality blastocyst was selected for fresh transfer. All group B patients (48 / 48) had at least one blastocyst remaining for cryopreservation. A total of 157 (40. 4 %) blastocysts were frozen in this group, a significantly larger proportion than was cryopreserved in group A (p= 0. 017, by chi-squared analysis). CONCLUSION: While aCGH and subsequent frozen embryo transfer are currently used to screen embryos, this is the first investigation to quantify the impact of aCGH specifically on embryo cryopreservation. Incorporation of aCGH screening significantly reduced the total number of cryopreserved blastocysts compared to when suitability for freezing was determined by morphology only. IVF patients should be counseled that the benefits of aCGH screening will likely come at the cost of sharply limiting the number of surplus embryos available for cryopreservation...|$|R
40|$|Polyembryonic is {{an embryo}} {{that has the}} {{tendency}} {{of more than one}} embryo in the seed (derived from the ovules), although this <b>embryo</b> <b>extra</b> does not have ripe embryos. The goal {{this study was to determine}} poliembrio on the citrus and kokosan, find out the growth of the seed sprouts from orange and kokosan poliembrio seeds and find out if the seeds can be used as seed. The materials used in this experiment include citrus and kokosan seed and medium sand. The tools used are cotton, filter paper, and the germination tub pinset. The experiment using factorial experimental design 2 X 4 (2 faktor) were arranged in a completely randomized design (CRD) for experiments conducted in the laboratory. The first factor is the separation of the embryo consists of two separated ways embryos and embryos are not separated. The second factor is the number of embryos composed of 4 cedar is the number of embryos 2, 4, 6 and 8. Conclusion research are citrus and kokosan seed have more than one embryo in the seed (Poliembrio), the growth of sprouts from seed poliembrio influenced by the size of the embryo, food reserves and germination environment, and seeds can be used as seed poliembrio the terms were grown in an optimal environment...|$|R
40|$|Programmed {{cell death}} (apoptosis) is a {{normally}} occurring process used to eliminate unnecessary or potentially harmful cells in multicellular organisms. Recent studies {{demonstrate that the}} molecular control {{of this process is}} conserved phylogenetically in animals. The dad- 1 gene, which encodes a novel 113 amino acid protein, was originally identified in a mutant hamster cell line (tsBN 7) that undergoes apoptosis at restrictive temperature. We have identified a dad- 1 homologue in Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce-dad- 1) whose predicted product is > 60 % identical to vertebrate DAD- 1. A search of the sequence databases indicated that DAD- 1 -like proteins are also expressed in two plant species.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the outcome of}} frozen-thawed ET using embryos previously biopsied for preimplan-tation genetic diagnosis during a fresh ET cycle. Design: Prospective evaluation. Setting: Assisted reproductive biology program. Patient(s) : A 31 -year-old, G 4, P 1, TAB 1, SAB 2 carrier of a balanced RT 45,XX der(14; 21) (q 10;q 10) translocation. Intervention(s) : Preimplantation genetic diagnosis by polar body biopsy. Excess embryos were frozen using the one-step method and then thawed. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Embryo survival after thawing and subsequent pregnancy outcome. Result(s) : Among the 32 mature oocytes, the results of {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} were available for 25 polar bodies. Eleven were unbalanced, 10 were normal (8 fertilized), and 4 were balanced (3 fertilized) for the fresh IVF cycle. Two normal embryos were transferred. Four normal and 3 balanced embryos were cryopreserved. A chemical pregnancy resulted. Four months later, the 7 cryopreserved embryos were thawed; 2 survived (1 balanced and 1 normal) and were transferred. An ongoing pregnancy resulted, and a normal (46,XX) female was delivered. Conclusion(s) : Freezing and thawing of biopsied embryos resulted in a low survival rate.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{successfully}} derive {{human embryonic stem}} cells (hESC) lines from human embryos following in vitro fertilization (IVF) opened up a plethora of potential applications of this technique. These cell lines could have been successfully used to increase our understanding of human developmental biology, transplantation medicine and the emerging science of regenerative medicine. The main source for human embryos has been ′discarded′ or ′spare′ fresh or frozen human embryos following IVF. It is a common practice to stimulate the ovaries of women undergoing any of the assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and retrieve multiple oocytes which subsequently lead to multiple embryos. Of these, only two or maximum of three embryos are transferred while the rest are cryopreserved as per {{the decision of the}} couple. In case a couple does not desire to ′cryopreserve′ their embryos then all the embryos remaining following embryo transfer can be considered ′spare′ or if a couple is no longer in need of the ′cryopreserved′ embryos then these also can be considered as ′spare′. But, the question raised by the ethicists is, "what about ′slightly′ over-stimulating a woman to get a few <b>extra</b> eggs and <b>embryos?</b> The decision becomes more difficult when it comes to ′discarded′ embryos. As of today, the quality of the embryos is primarily assessed based on morphology and the rate of development mainly judged by single point assessment. Despite many criteria described in the literature, the quality assessment is purely subjective. The question that arises is on the decision of ′discarding′ embryos. What would be the criteria for discarding embryos and the potential ′use′ of ESC derived from the ′abnormal appearing′ embryos?

40|$|Summary In IVF/ICSI treatments, {{two or more}} embryos {{are often}} {{transferred}} to maximize the chance of success, which brings results in {{a high incidence of}} multiple pregnancy. Multiple pregnancies are associated with an increased incidence of mortality, a higher percentage of birth defects, increased incidence of low birth weight and premature deliveries. Performing single embryo transfers {{is the only way to}} avoid multiples pregnancies. This puts embryo selection to a challenge: choosing the embryo with the highest implantation potential so that the pregnancy rate remains high and the multiple pregnancy rate drops to a minimum. Predicting outcome based on embryo selection based on assessment of development and morphology has limited value. This can be explained by a substantial intra- and inter-observer variability in morphological grading. Extra, novel non-invasive markers relevant to implantation potential are needed to improve the selection of the embryo with the highest implantation potential. Therefore in the first section of this thesis, potential peptide biomarkers for oocyte/embryo viability were screened. The second section focused on the prediction model of embryo implantation potential using computer assisted scoring system. In the last section, the impact of clinical characteristics of patients on outcome was investigated in order to optimize patient counselling and to identify a reference population to allow benchmarking between clinics. As a proof of principle, the peptide patterns were found to be promising in the discrimination of oocyte viability, regarding fertilization outcome, embryo development, and implantation success. Predictive models were constructed based on parameters measured with computer assisted scoring system, including the number of blastomeres, size difference between blastomeres, the percentage of fragmentation, and total cytoplasmic volume, showing a higher accuracy rate than models based on the standard morphologic assessments. The last section revealed that the exclusion of presence of tubal pathology in patients resulted in higher pregnancy rate and live birth rate, and a new reference population was suggested. This project demonstrates the proof of principle of the use of follicular fluid biomarkers as an <b>extra</b> tool for <b>embryo</b> selection: prediction models for the outcome in a human IVF/ICSI program can be optimized using morphometric data and clinical parameters.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the public policy}} outcomes in Australia in two distinct but related policy domains; Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) and Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC) research and cloning. Central to each policy domain is an important actor; the <b>extra</b> uterine human <b>embryo.</b> Without the surplus embryos created by default through ART, ESC research would not have eventuated. The possibility of cloned human embryos through Somatic Cell Nuclear Transplant (SCNT) technology represents the ultimate in ART. Each of these policy domains are characterised by divisive and irresolvable ethical conflicts over the moral status of the embryo or {{what it means to}} be human in the 21 st Century. Each policy domain is also characterised by technological innovations which require policy solutions to new and complex policy problems. The central dilemma is how to elucidate policy when the problems are multidimensional, grounded in medicine, science and technology and deep conflicts over values exist. The standard response of disaggregating complex policy issues into their constituent components and referring them to a technocratic elite for solution is unsatisfactory because the essential contestation is not over facts but over values. In each of these policy arenas, there are multiple actors who form distinct coalitions to promote a particular policy stance. The policy stances however are not informed by shared beliefs and values. Rather the policy outcomes emerge from the contest between competing narratives which allow interests with different values and beliefs to come together around a shared storyline. Hajer's Discourse Coalition framework was used to identify the interests, discourses and narratives operating in each policy domain. In ART, particular health, science, ethics and industry interests form a discourse coalition around the dominant narrative of hope to promote public policies allowing increasingly wider access to ART for the involuntary childless. In this policy arena the extrauterine embryo is ambiguously constructed as both the desired child and a quality product. In the Australian context, ART policy remains within the private sphere of reproduction and the health policy domain under the jurisdiction of State and Territory governments despite efforts to place it on the national policy agenda. In ESC research and cloning, specific ethical, health and wellbeing, science and industry interests form a discourse coalition around the dominant narrative of 'saviour science' to promote a relatively permissive policy position on embryo research and therapeutic cloning. The embryo moves out of the private sphere of reproduction into the public sphere of international biotechnology, and is thoroughly commodified as a scientific and economic resource. The ESC policy domain requires a national policy response because it impacts on Australia as a scientific innovator and producer in the globally competitive biotechnology arena. Thus, two very different policy outcomes emerge despite a shared essential actor in the extrauterine embryo. The Discourse Coalition approach provides an alternative analysis of policy issues with seemingly irresolvable conflicts. It also provides a potential alternative policy making paradigm that allows interests with different norms and belief systems to form policy coalitions around a shared narrative to advance a particular policy position without sacrificing their underlying values...|$|R
