500|$|Like {{her debut}} album, Kesha worked with some {{previous}} producers and writers that {{worked with her}} on her first album, such as: Dr. Luke, Ammo, Benny Blanco and Max Martin. Unlike her debut album though, Kesha {{enlisted the help of}} producer Bangladesh. She explained the reason for enlisting his help was that she wanted to [...] "add a tougher edge to her music". She said that the message she wanted to put out through this album was to create [...] "good, positive, [...] music". She elaborated, [...] "I feel like I’m creating this hopefully very youthful and irreverent movement of the kids, of like adolescence. I feel like the parents don’t get it, but the kids get it.

500|$|On the {{negative}} side, Marty Racine of the Houston Chronicle said that [...] "I Don't Wanna Know" [...] and [...] "Take Me Home" [...] {{were the only}} songs to [...] "rise above the crowd", and that Collins focused too much on his singing and less on his drumming, [...] "which can be captivating". Racine also added that the album makes the listener feel a little [...] "cold", but admired that the singer was [...] "playing the game as well as anyone". Writing an article in defence of Collins in 2010, Gary Mills of The Quietus described the album as [...] "determined dross" [...] which Collins did not <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his career judged by. In 2013, music critic Tom Service of The Guardian was similarly scathing, saying the album had not {{stood the test of}} time and was [...] "unlistenable to today", singling out [...] "Sussudio" [...] for particular criticism, arguing: [...] "the production, the drum machine, the inane sincerity of the lyrics; there's no colder or more superficial sound in popular music, precisely because it takes itself so seriously." [...] He also compared it unfavourably with the enduring appeal of Collins's 1980s contemporaries such as the Human League and—in particular—the Pet Shop Boys, saying the latter were [...] "geniuses by comparison".|$|E
