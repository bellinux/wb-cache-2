5|$|The {{derivative}} of a function can, in principle, be computed from the definition {{by considering the}} difference quotient, and computing its limit. In practice, once the <b>derivatives</b> of a few simple functions are known, the <b>derivatives</b> of other functions are more easily computed using rules for obtaining <b>derivatives</b> of more complicated functions from simpler ones.|$|E
5|$|Biomedical {{researchers}} {{have examined the}} applications of rhodium compounds and their <b>derivatives</b> in medicine and reported one potential application for a rhodocene derivative as a radiopharmaceutical to treat small cancers. Rhodocene <b>derivatives</b> are used to synthesise linked metallocenes so that metal–metal interactions can be studied; potential applications of these <b>derivatives</b> include molecular electronics and research into the mechanisms of catalysis. The value of rhodocenes tends {{to be in the}} insights they provide into the bonding and dynamics of novel chemical systems, rather than their applications.|$|E

5|$|Enron's {{aggressive}} {{accounting practices}} were not {{hidden from the}} board of directors, as later learned by a Senate subcommittee. The board was informed of the rationale for using the Whitewing, LJM, and Raptor transactions, and after approving them, received status updates on the entities' operations. Although not all of Enron's widespread improper accounting practices were revealed to the board, the practices were dependent on board decisions. Even though Enron extensively relied on <b>derivatives</b> for its business, the company's Finance Committee and board {{did not have enough}} experience with <b>derivatives</b> to understand what they were being told. The Senate subcommittee argued that had there been a detailed understanding of how the <b>derivatives</b> were organized, the board would have prevented their use.|$|E

5|$|The {{reaction}} of carbon disulfide (CS2) with electron deficient acetylene <b>derivatives</b> is proposed to give transient 1,3-dithiolium carbenes (i.e. where X1 = X2 = S), which then dimerise to give <b>derivatives</b> of tetrathiafulvene. Thus {{it is possible}} that the reverse of this process might be occurring in similar carbenes.|$|E
25|$|Several {{concepts}} of a <b>derivative</b> {{may be defined}} on a Banach space. See the articles on the Fréchet <b>derivative</b> and the Gâteaux <b>derivative</b> for details. The Fréchet <b>derivative</b> allows for {{an extension of the}} concept of a directional <b>derivative</b> to Banach spaces. The Gâteaux <b>derivative</b> allows for an extension of a directional <b>derivative</b> to locally convex topological vector spaces. Fréchet differentiability is a stronger condition than Gâteaux differentiability. The quasi-derivative is another generalization of directional <b>derivative</b> that implies a stronger condition than Gâteaux differentiability, but a weaker condition than Fréchet differentiability.|$|R
