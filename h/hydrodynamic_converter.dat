50|$|Closed {{loop systems}} in mobile {{equipment}} are generally {{used for the}} transmission {{as an alternative to}} mechanical and <b>hydrodynamic</b> (<b>converter)</b> transmissions. The advantage is a stepless gear ratio (continuously variable speed/torque) and a more flexible control of the gear ratio depending on the load and operating conditions. The hydrostatic transmission is generally limited to around 200 kW maximum power, as the total cost gets too high at higher power compared to a hydrodynamic transmission. Large wheel loaders for instance and heavy machines are therefore usually equipped with converter transmissions. Recent technical achievements for the converter transmissions have improved the efficiency and developments in the software have also improved the characteristics, for example selectable gear shifting programs during operation and more gear steps, giving them characteristics close to the hydrostatic transmission.|$|E

40|$|The {{modeling}} {{technique of}} <b>hydrodynamic</b> torque <b>converter</b> flow passage was investigated. The semi-automatic model ing technique of torque converter flow passage was proposed. The flow passage model of each converter wheel is con sidered as a revolution entity sliced by two curved surfaces. In order {{to generate the}} revolution entity, a new approxima tion method, condition optimum arc approximation, was proposed. The method was used to approximate the meridional streamlines of {{the inner and outer}} wall. As a result, the three-dimensional revolution entity can be conveniently gener ated. In order to create slice surfaces, the central stream surface of flow passage was approximated with a quadric sur face. The normal vector of the quadric surface and the thickness/thickness-function of bade were used to calculate the discrete point coordinates of blade surfaces. Via the rotation transformation to the coordinates, the discrete point coordi nates of slice surfaces were obtained. A parameterized program code used for the <b>hydrodynamic</b> torque <b>converter</b> de sign and semi-automatic modeling was developed. Modeling errors were calculated and analyzed. The flow passage model was generated in several minutes with the help o f the program code, Auto CAD and Solidworks software. Fi nally, the model was inputted into Gambit, and the pre-processing task used for the numerical simulation of torque converter flow field was successfully completed. The investigation results show that the semi-automatic modeling not only can ensure the accuracy of modeling, but also librates the research and design workers of torque converter from the time-consuming modeling work, which paves the way for the numerical simulation of the complex flow field of the <b>hydrodynamic</b> torque <b>converter.</b> </p...|$|R

At that time, mechanical reduction gears for such high power applications were not available. The core idea of <b>hydrodynamic</b> torque <b>converters</b> and fluid couplings is to provide wear free power transmission using a hydraulic closed pump and turbine cycle. In the following decades, <b>hydrodynamic</b> torque <b>converters</b> experienced significant improvements driven by the automotive industry, and their use spread into various applications. Today, torque converters are commonly used in cars, busses, locomotives, construction equipment, and gas compression as a means of (i) smooth power transmission, (ii) to provide torque amplification during startup conditions, and (iii) to act as a damper for driver and driven equipment torsional disturbances and shock loads. In the oil and gas industry, torque converters are often used as integrated components in drive transmissions for electric motor driven compressors or pumps trains. They provide step-less speed variation along with progressive torque increase towards low speed. For example, torque converters and hydraulic couplings can be used to drive a variable speed centrifugal compressor using a fixed speed electric motor without the need for a variable frequency drive. In recent years, torque converters in combination with planetary gearboxes have been successfully demonstrated as a viable technology for variable speed electric motor driven centrifugal compressor applications. Torque converters are also used as soft starters between generators and gas or steam turbines. The unique power transmission features of the torque converter make it an option for equipment that requires start-up torque assistance and speed control. Modern torque converters up to 65, 000 kW have been designed and are widely in operation...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering) The {{automotive}} driveline {{design engineer}} is invariably {{confronted with a}} limited range of driveline components, the combination of which {{can result in a}} design which is far from optimal for vehicle overall performance. Due to the close interaction between the prime mover and the torque converter of an automotive driveline incorporating an automatic transmission, the requirement developed to be able to design or modify a torque converter to attain more optimal prime mover/torque converter interaction. Two torque converters of similar configuration formed the basis of this study. A test bench was developed to verifythe published characteristic of the torque converters under controlled conditions. A computer program was developed to analyse the performance of the specific torque converters. This program is similar to the program developed by Lamprecht [10], which was further refined by the Buro of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Stellenbosch. A method was established to enable accurate and consistent geometry measurement of torque converters. The analysis program was evaluated by establishing the correlation between the theoretical and published results. Based on the results further refinement was done to the analysis program. A parametric study was done based on the geometry of the larger capacity torque converter. Five components (two impellers, two turbines and a single stator) of alternative design but interchangeable with the standard components, were designed and manufactured, These components were fitted individually and tested on the test bench to establish the correlation between the experimental results and design calculations.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the total power {{converted}} by a wave energy farm is influenced by the hydrodynamic interactions between wave energy converters, especially when they are close to each other. Therefore, to improve the performance of a wave energy farm, the <b>hydrodynamic</b> interaction between <b>converters</b> must be considered, which can be influenced by the power take-off damping of individual converters. In this paper, the performance of arrays of wave energy <b>converters</b> under optimal <b>hydrodynamic</b> interaction and power take-off damping is investigated. This is achieved by coordinating the power take-off damping of individual converters, resulting in optimal hydrodynamic interaction as well as higher production of time-averaged power converted by the farm. Physical constraints on motion amplitudes are considered in the solution, which is required for the practical implementation of wave energy converters. Results indicate that the natural frequency of a wave energy converter under optimal damping will not vary with sea states, but the production performance of a wave energy farm can be improved significantly while satisfying the motion constraints.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the global design of direct driven {{permanent}} magnet (PM) generator associated with fixedpitch turbine for tidal energy generation. A global design approach of the generator design is proposed which {{takes into account the}} tidal site energy potential, the turbine <b>hydrodynamic</b> characteristic, the <b>converter</b> characteristics and an original power levelling control strategy. Because the considered turbine is without variable pitch control, the power levelling strategy is only based on torque/speed electrical control of the generator. Applying this global design process, it can be shown that the hydrodynamic characteristic (shape of the power coefficient curve (Cp)) have strong effects on the final design of the generator. The aim of the presented work is to evaluate this influence. Two Cp curves are considered for the same resource, turbine diameter and rated power. The obtained designs are compared in terms of cost and mass of the active parts and power factor of the generator.

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry {{has long been}} searching for efficient ways to improve vehicle performance such as drivability, fuel consumption, and emissions. Researchers in the {{automotive industry}} have tried to develop methods to improve fuel consumption and reduce the emission gases of a vehicle, while satisfying drivability and ride comfort issues. Today, by developing computer/software technologies, automotive manufacturers are moving more and more towards modelling a real component (prototype) in a software domain (virtual prototype). For instance, modelling the components of a vehicle's powertrain (driveline) in the software domain helps the designers to iterate the model for different operating conditions and scenarios to obtain better performance without any cost of making a real prototype. The objective {{of this research is}} to develop and validate physics-based powertrain models with sufficient fidelity to be useful to the automotive industry for rapid prototyping. Developing a physics-based powertrain model that can accurately simulate real phenomenon in the powertrain components is of great importance. For instance, a high-fidelity simulation of the combustion phenomenon in the internal combustion (IC) engine with detailed physical and chemical reactions {{can be used as a}} virtual prototype to estimate physical prototype characteristics in a shorter time than it would take to build a physical prototype. Therefore, the powertrain design can be explored and validated virtually in the software domain to reduce the cost and time of product development. The main focus of this thesis is on development of an internal combustion engine model, four-cylinder spark ignition engine, and a <b>hydrodynamic</b> torque <b>converter</b> model. Then, the models are integrated along with the rest of a powertrain's components (e. g. vehicle longitudinal dynamics model) through acausal connections, which represents a more feasible physics-based powertrain model for model-based control design. The powertrain model can be operated at almost all operating conditions (e. g. wide range of the engine speeds and loads), and is able to capture some transient behaviour of the powertrain as well as the steady state response. Moreover, the parametric formulation of each component in the proposed powertrain model makes the model more efficient to simulate different types of powertrain (e. g. for a passenger car or truck) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) of split-power design consists of a variator and an arrangement of planetary gears. A black box model describing such transmissions is presented. The model {{can be used for}} synthesis as well as loss-free analysis of split-power CVT concepts in general. The planetary gear arrangement may have an arbitrary number of shafts. It is described by a sufficient number of basic speed ratios. By using several modes, both a large overall speed ratio range and low variator power ratios can be obtained. This is necessary for optimal engine use and high transmission efficiency. In each mode, specific components are active in the transmission. The black box model includes two modes, but CVT concepts with an arbitrary number of modes can be described by combining matching two-mode CVTs. General conditions for performing mode shifts are presented. A general relationship between overall speed ratio and variator speed ratio has been derived, as well as a general relationship for variator power ratios of loss-free transmissions. Different variator types are categorized by their ratio coverage. Possible combinations of variator power ratio, overall ratio coverage and variator ratio coverage are mapped and presented graphically for different configurations. Suitable combinations of these quantities can be chosen. Design parameters included will then indicate how the CVT should be designed. On the basis of the black box model, two split-power CVT concepts for automotive use are proposed. Each of the transmissions, having a geared neutral, is an infinitely variable transmission (IVT). They do not need such devices as starting clutches or <b>hydrodynamic</b> torque <b>converters.</b> They are designed for use in front wheel drive cars with transversely mounted engines. The main components of the first IVT are a traction ball drive variator, a simple epicyclic gear train with three shafts and some gear stages. The transmission can be run in three modes, including a separate mode for reverse. The second IVT consists of a hydrostatic variator, two simple epicyclic gear trains with three shafts and a few gear stages. It can be run in two modes. Reverse drive is included in one of the modes. Losses in gear meshes and variators are estimated. Hereby, constant component efficiencies are used, as well as efficiencies calculated taking load and speed dependence of the losses into consideration...|$|R
40|$|Die vorliegende Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der Gruppenschaltungsansteuerung von Nutzfahrzeuggetrieben. Gruppengetriebe, d. h. in Reihe geschaltete Getrie-be, sind bei Nutzfahrzeugschaltgetrieben weit verbreitet. Es wird dann von Gruppenschaltungen gesprochen, wenn zwei in Reihe geschaltete Getriebe gleichzeitig die Übersetzung wechseln. Wird während der Schaltung die Last von der Getriebeeingangswelle genommen, handelt es sich um eine technisch beherrschbare Aufgabe. Bei Automatikgetrieben wird der Übersetzungswechsel aber mit anliegender Eingangslast ausgeführt. Die Automatikgetriebe zählen zur Kategorie der Lastschaltgetriebe. Bei Nutzfahrzeugautomatikgetrieben werden bisher Gruppenschaltungen vermieden, da die Ansteuerung der Kupplungen und Bremsen auch ohne Gruppenschaltung bereits anspruchsvoll ist. Die vorliegen-de Arbeit hat zum Ziel, den Gruppenwechsel unter dem Gesichtspunkt der Zug-kraftschaltung beherrschbar zu machen. Die Arbeit umfasst drei wesentliche Schwerpunkte. Hierzu zählt die Erstellung eines Getriebeprogramms für die Antriebsstrangstreckensimulation, die Optimie-rung der Übersetzungswechsel mit einem auf die Fragestellung angepassten Optimierungsprogramm und die Auslegungsempfehlungen für die Ansteuerung des Übersetzungswechsels in Automatikgetrieben. Aufgrund eines fehlenden Simulationswerkzeugs zu Beginn der Arbeit wurde für die Beantwortung des Ge-triebeverhaltens im Übersetzungswechsel ein entsprechendes Getriebepro-gramm entwickelt. Das Getriebeprogramm arbeitet als Unterprogramm innerhalb einer Basisantriebsstrangsimualtion für Streckensimulation und wurde so gestal-tet, dass beliebige Planetengetriebeanordnungen modelliert werden können. Aus der großen Anzahl von Simulationsrechnungen wurden Auslegungsempfeh-lungen für die Steuerung des Übersetzungswechsels abgeleitet. Das zeitlich sehr empfindliche Verhalten von Gruppenschaltungen führt zu einem Lösungs-ansatz mit Kennfeldern. Durch das Vorhalten optimierter Überdeckungen für un-terschiedliche Schaltausgangsvoraussetzungen mit Hilfe von Kennfeldern konn-te die Gruppenschaltung auch unter dem Aspekt der Zugkraftschaltung beherrschbar gemacht werden. Product {{development}} {{according to}} current aspects cannot afford to neglect the customer's requirements. This influences the economical {{success of a}} product significantly. The technical solution {{must be based on}} the customer's requirements but without neglecting the basic demands which apply to every gearbox. The behaviour of the automatic transmission during a gearshift is of vital importance to the customer and can become the most important criterion when considering whether or not to purchase. Further main tasks of the automatic transmission are the automatic gear selection taking into consideration the efficiency, the power and the driver's wishes. In this case {{it is a question of}} fundamental technical requirements without which a product will not be successful. With an automatic transmission it is easier to drive a vehicle with the result that road safety is improved. The demands on the automatic transmissions show that the automatic control is of great significance. This thesis is largely concerned with the gear control. Via sensors, the gear control receives information regarding the state of the vehicle and the driver's requirements. With the input variables considering the shift-strategy, the output variables are determined. This process is taken over by the control program and/or the shift point control. In this way the control program determines the time of the gearshift. The gear steering has a further program which is called the shift quality control. The shift quality control activates the hydraulic valves and actually performs the gear ratio change. The design of the shift quality control is the nucleus of this thesis. Emphases of the thesis The thesis concentrates on three main points: the preparation of a detailed gear model for the power train simulation, the optimization of the gear shifting and the design recommendations for the timing of the gear shifting in automatic transmissions. Gear model The gear model enables the arbitrary arrangement of elementary planetary gearing on a modular basis. Additionally, the gear model makes it possible to illustrate the gear shifting without restrictions. Furthermore, the model preparation was influenced by the standards of the basic simulation. Because of this, the solution algorithm must be adapted to suit the basic simulation. The gearbox can be built up from six basic elements in any way required. The elements are a <b>hydrodynamic</b> torque <b>converter,</b> open elementary planetary gearing, clutches, free wheels, supplies and nodes. The <b>hydrodynamic</b> torque <b>converter</b> is the typical driving element of the automatic transmission. The elementary planetary gearing leads and changes torque and rotation speed. The clutches change the ratio. Free-wheels are exclusively used in the torque converter. The supplies lead the driving power to the relevant power train, or connect to the case of the gear box. The nodes link the different gear elements to each other. This structure can simulate automatic transmissions with arbitrary arrangement under realistic conditions, also during the gearshift. Optimization The optimization algorithm supports the calculation of the variants during the structuring. Afterwards it calculates the variants automatically in a so-called batch mode. The variation is carried out according to the chronological overlap of the acting clutches. That means that the opening and locking times are changed automatically. After the calculation the results are evaluated automatically. Basically this is a question of screening the results from the variation calculation. The procedure used here, the least squares method, means that evaluations can be carried out for several results. The procedure of the least squares method computes the deviations of a simulated process from an ideal previously defined. The optimization algorithm allows the objective classification of the shift-quality. Design recommendations The optimization calculation proved the sensitive behaviour of the gear change, particularly with group shifts. The design recommendations concern the chronological overlap, the pressure functions as well as the amount of the design pressure during the slipping time. These design recommendations are formulated in a general manner, although the object of consideration is the gearbox. Furthermore, design recommendations were formulated for group shifting and their chronological activation. The behaviour of the group shifting is very sensitive. Optimized characteristic diagrams can solve this sensitive behaviour. The optimized characteristic diagrams must be set up ready for the respective operational status of vehicles...|$|R
