5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the <b>impedance</b> <b>match,</b> conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E
25|$|Horn {{loudspeakers}} are {{the oldest}} form of loudspeaker system. The use of horns as voice-amplifying megaphones dates {{at least to}} the 17th century, and horns were used in mechanical gramophones as early as 1857. Horn loudspeakers use a shaped waveguide in front of or behind the driver to increase the directivity of the loudspeaker and to transform a small diameter, high pressure condition at the driver cone surface to a large diameter, low pressure condition {{at the mouth of the}} horn. This improves the acoustic—electro/mechanical <b>impedance</b> <b>match</b> between the driver and ambient air, increasing efficiency, and focusing the sound over a narrower area.|$|E
40|$|Harold Wheeler, in the 1940 s developed, in {{a simple}} form, the {{principles}} of double-tuned <b>impedance</b> <b>matching.</b> These relationships are not well known. They are very useful for the antenna designer in providing a structured approach to obtain near maximum bandwidth for narrowband and moderate-band antennas with a specified VSWR limit using a practical arrangement of tuning elements. Wheeler first developed relationships for single-tuned <b>impedance</b> <b>matching,</b> which relate the fractional bandwidth to the antenna Q and the maximum permissible reflection-coefficient magnitude (or VSWR). He used the results of single-tuned <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> to derive the relationship for double-tuned <b>impedance</b> <b>matching.</b> Wheeler’s double-tuned <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> relationship is the best overall measure of the achievable fractional bandwidth for an antenna. Double tuning is practical and provides {{more than double the}} fractional bandwidth of single-tuned <b>impedance</b> <b>matching.</b> One example of double-tuned <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> is presented.

500|$|Sections at the {{beginning}} and end of the filter are often chosen for their <b>impedance</b> <b>match</b> in to the terminations rather than the shape of their frequency response. [...] For this purpose, m-type sections of m = 0.6 are the most common choice. [...] An alternative is mm'-type sections of m=0.7230 and m=0.4134 although this type of section is rarely used. [...] While it has several advantages noted below, it has the disadvantages of being more complex and also, if constant k sections are required in the body of the filter, it is then necessary to include m-type sections to interface the mm'-type to the k-types.|$|E
500|$|The {{transfer}} function of an mm'-type {{is the same}} as an m-type with m set to the product mm. [...] To choose values of m and m for best <b>impedance</b> <b>match</b> requires the designer to choose two frequencies at which the match is to be exact, at other frequencies there will be some deviation. [...] There is thus some leeway in the choice but Zobel suggests the values m=0.7230 and m=0.4134 which give a deviation of the impedance of less than 2% over the useful part of the band. [...] Since mm=0.3, this section will also have a much faster cut-off than an m-type of m=0.6 which is an alternative for impedance matching.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the main}} {{drawbacks}} of the image parameter design method in this, as in other, filters is that the <b>impedance</b> <b>match</b> at the terminations is not good. [...] This usually requires that impedance matching sections are provided at the input and output. [...] These usually {{take the form of}} multi-section stepped impedance transformers. [...] These add considerably to the overall length of the filter.Matthaei et al., pp.397–408 [...] A small improvement to matching can be had by starting and ending the filter on a half-space instead of a full tooth or space. [...] The lumped circuit equivalent of this is T-half-sections terminating the filter at either end. [...] Starting and ending on a half-tooth instead of a half space is the equivalent of Π-half-sections.|$|E
500|$|A {{consequence}} of the image method of filter design is {{that the effect of}} the end terminations has to be calculated separately if its effects on response are to be taken into account. [...] The most severe deviation of the response from that predicted occurs in the passband close to cut-off. [...] The reason for this is twofold. [...] Further into the passband the <b>impedance</b> <b>match</b> progressively improves, thus limiting the error. [...] On the other hand, waves in the stopband are reflected from the end termination due to mismatch but are attenuated twice by the filter stopband rejection as they pass through it. [...] So while stopband impedance mismatch may be severe, it has only limited effect on the filter response.|$|E
500|$|A {{simple method}} of {{impedance}} matching is stub matching {{with a single}} stub. [...] However, a single stub will only produce a perfect match at one particular frequency. [...] This technique is therefore only suitable for narrow band applications. [...] To widen the bandwidth multiple stubs may be used, and the structure then takes on {{the form of a}} stub filter. [...] The design proceeds {{as if it were a}} filter except that a different parameter is optimised. [...] In a frequency filter typically the parameter optimised is stopband rejection, passband attenuation, steepness of transition, or some compromise between these. [...] In a matching network the parameter optimised is the <b>impedance</b> <b>match.</b> [...] The function of the device does not require a restriction of bandwidth, but the designer is nevertheless forced to choose a bandwidth because of the structure of the device.|$|E

An <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> computer program was developed which is capable of <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> the characteristics of each disturbance independent of other reflections in the guide.

500|$|Slotted lines {{can measure}} {{standing}} waves, wavelength, and, with some calculation or plotting on Smith charts, {{a number of}} other parameters including reflection coefficient and electrical impedance. [...] A precision variable attenuator is often incorporated in the test setup to improve accuracy. [...] This is used to make level measurements, while the detector and VSWR meter are retained only to mark a reference point for the attenuator to be set to, thus eliminating entirely the detector and meter measurement errors. [...] The parameter most commonly measured by a slotted line is SWR. This serves as a measure of the accuracy of the <b>impedance</b> <b>match</b> to the item under test. [...] This is especially important for transmitting antennas and their feed lines; high standing wave ratio on a radio or TV antenna can distort the signal, increase transmission line loss and potentially damage components in the transmission path, possibly even the transmitter.|$|E
500|$|Synthesis methods allow {{better control}} of the precise filter {{response}}. [...] A common response function used by filter designers is the Chebyshev filter which trades steepness of the transition band for passband ripple. [...] However the Chebyshev response {{is not always the}} best choice for waffle-iron filters. [...] Low-pass waveguide filters do not pass frequencies {{all the way down to}} zero because of the waveguide cutoff effect. [...] A better choice is the Achieser-Zolotarev filter. [...] This filter is based on Zolotarev polynomials (which include the Chebyshev polynomials as a special case) discovered by Yegor Ivanovich Zolotarev. [...] The Zolotarev response has a stopband at low frequency, the cutoff of which can be controlled by the designer so it is not detrimental in a waveguide filter. [...] The advantage of the Zolotarev response is that it results in a filter with a better <b>impedance</b> <b>match</b> to the connecting waveguides compared to the Chebyshev filter or image-parameter filters.|$|E
