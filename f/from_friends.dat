5|$|In 1971, Applewhite briefly {{moved to}} New Mexico, where he {{operated}} a delicatessen. He was popular with customers {{but decided to}} return to Texas later that year. His father died around that time; the loss took a significant emotional toll on him, causing severe depression. His debts mounted, forcing him to borrow money <b>from</b> <b>friends.</b>|$|E
5|$|Antankarana {{homes are}} {{typically}} raised on stilts above ground level. Young men seeking {{to start a}} family typically leave their father's house and build their own from wood and thatch gathered locally. After marrying a young woman will leave her family's home to move into her husband's house, where she manages the household and assists in planting and harvesting rice. The husband is responsible for earning money for basic necessities and farming the family's land. A young couple typically receives furniture and other essentials as wedding gifts <b>from</b> <b>friends,</b> family and community members. Divorce and remarriage are common in Antankarana society.|$|E
5|$|Mickiewicz and {{his family}} lived in {{relative}} poverty, their major source of income being occasional publication of his work – not a very profitable endeavor. They received support <b>from</b> <b>friends</b> and patrons, {{but not enough to}} substantially change their situation. Despite spending most of his remaining years in France, Mickiewicz would never receive French citizenship, nor any support from the French government. By the late 1830s he was less active as a writer, and also less visible on the Polish émigré political scene.|$|E

5|$|The {{biggest concern}} was food; {{ensuring}} {{there was enough}} food occupied most of the internees' time. Little food {{was provided by the}} Japanese authorities, and it was of poor quality – frequently containing dust, mud, rat and cockroach excreta, cigarette ends, and sometimes dead rats. Everyday, the internees were served rice congee at 8am, and meals consisting of rice with stew at both 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. Additionally, they relied on food mailed <b>from</b> <b>friends</b> or relatives in the city, Red Cross aid, garden-grown vegetables, and bought food from the canteen or the black market.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation <b>from</b> <b>friends</b> and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky's debut feature, Pi, {{also written}} as π, {{was shot in}} November 1997. The film was financed in part from $100 {{donations}} <b>from</b> <b>friends</b> and family. In return, he promised to pay each back $150 if the film made money, and they would at least get screen credit if the film lost money. Producing the film with an initial budget of $60,000, Aronofsky premiered Pi at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, where he won the Best Director award. The film itself {{was nominated for a}} special Jury Award. Artisan Entertainment bought distribution rights for $1 million. The film was released to the public later that year to critical acclaim and it grossed a total of $3,221,152 at the box-office. Pi was the first film to be made available for download on the Internet.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Sports Illustrated {{magazine}} estimated Vick's {{annual income}} between his NFL salary and endorsements at $25.4 million, ranking him just below NASCAR's Dale Earnhardt, Jr. in a listing of highest earning athletes. Vick's finances suffered, however, from poor management, bad investments and lawsuits. Certified Financial Planner Michael Smith advised Vick from 2003-2005, but resigned after Vick took bad advice <b>from</b> <b>friends,</b> made ill-conceived investments, overspent, and otherwise undermined the wealth-building plan that Smith had created. Smith's plan was for Vick to have a net wealth of $100 million by 2010; by that date Vick was actually an estimated $20million in debt.|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} {{with a more}} experimental ethos until the company began {{to run out of}} capital. The Canadian government loan that had funded Polytron's prototyping phase was not renewed for their production phase. They also lost funding from the organization that preceded the Indie Fund as Polytron's producer left the company. Fish borrowed money <b>from</b> <b>friends</b> and family for three months to keep the company open. In dire straits, he considered canceling the project. In March 2011, the nearby Québécois developer-publisher Trapdoor offered to help Polytron, having just signed a deal with Electronic Arts to publish their own game, Warp. Trapdoor assisted with Polytron's finances and operations and offered to treat them as part of their company and let them keep their intellectual property rights in exchange for a portion of Fez earnings. Fish felt that partnership rescued the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 The Map of Love {{appeared}} {{as a collection of}} 16 poems and seven of the 20 short stories published by Thomas in magazines since 1934. Ten stories in his next book, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog (1940), were based less on lavish fantasy than The Map of Love and more on real-life romances featuring himself in Wales. Sales of both books were poor, resulting in Thomas living on meagre fees from writing and reviewing. At this time he borrowed heavily <b>from</b> <b>friends</b> and acquaintances. Hounded by creditors, Thomas and his family left Laugharne in July 1940 and moved to the home of critic John Davenport in Marshfield, Gloucestershire. There Thomas collaborated with Davenport on the satire The Death of the King's Canary, though due to fears of libel the work was not published until 1976.|$|E
40|$|Members of the mitogen-activated {{protein kinase}} (MAPK) family, {{including}} Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), {{play an important}} role in the proliferation of erythroid cells in response to erythropoietin (Epo). Erythroid cells infected with the Friend spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) proliferate in the absence of Epo and show constitutive activation of Epo signal transduction pathways. We previously demonstrated that the ERK pathway was constitutively activated in Friend SFFV-infected erythroid cells, and in this study JNK is also shown to be constitutively activated. Pharmacological inhibitors of both the ERK and JNK pathways stopped the proliferation of primary erythroleukemic cells <b>from</b> <b>Friend</b> SFFV-infected mice, with little induction of apoptosis, and furthermore blocked their ability to form Epo-independent colonies. However, only the JNK inhibitor blocked the proliferation of erythroleukemia cell lines derived from these mice. The JNK inhibitor caused significant apoptosis in these cell lines as well as an increase in the fraction of cells in G 2 /M and undergoing endoreduplication. In contrast, the growth of erythroleukemia cell lines derived <b>from</b> <b>Friend</b> murine leukemia virus (MuLV) -infected mice was inhibited by both the MEK and JNK inhibitors. JNK is important for AP 1 activity, and we found that JNK inhibitor treatment reduced AP 1 DNA-binding activity in primary erythroleukemic splenocytes <b>from</b> <b>Friend</b> SFFV-infected mice and in erythroleukemia cell lines <b>from</b> <b>Friend</b> MuLV-infected mice but did not alter AP 1 DNA binding in erythroleukemia cell lines <b>from</b> <b>Friend</b> SFFV-infected mice. These data suggest that JNK plays an important role in cell proliferation and/or the survival of erythroleukemia cells...|$|R

Julian won a contract to provide Upjohn with $2 million worth of progesterone (equivalent to $ million today). To compete against Syntex, {{he would have to}} use the same Mexican yam Mexican barbasco trade as his starting material. Julian used his own money and borrowed <b>from</b> <b>friends</b> to build a processing plant in Mexico, but he could not get a permit from the government to harvest the yams. Abraham Zlotnik, a former Jewish University of Vienna classmate whom Julian had helped escape from the Holocaust, led a search to find a new source of the yam in Guatemala for the company.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, MacLaren {{and his family}} struggled financially. His wife's family sometimes sent money, but MacLaren often spent extravagantly whenever he had funds. On one occasion, when paid for writing an article, he moved out of his accommodation into an expensive hotel, and threw a dinner party for his friends. He ran up many debts—including an unpaid champagne bill at Old Trafford Cricket Ground in 1923—and borrowed money <b>from</b> <b>friends.</b> He supplemented his wife's income through working as a journalist and a coach. Among other business ventures, he designed a cricket bat, showed specially shot cricket films, briefly owned a hotel and attempted to start a horse bloodstock agency. He continued to play club cricket and in 1924–25 he managed a privately organised tour of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Jennings's {{personal}} finances {{suffered from}} the panic of 1819, while the Indiana governorship continued to increase his financial burden. Jennings {{was never able to}} recover from his debts. One historian suggests that Jennings's financial situation may arisen from the expenses incurred during his political campaigns, his long-time service in state government, and being too busy to adequately manage his farm. Jennings and his wife frequently entertained visitors, legislators, and other dignitaries at their Corydon home. At a high-profile dinner in 1819, he hosted President James Monroe and General Andrew Jackson at a dinner held in their honor in Jeffersonville, when the two leaders were making a tour of the frontier states. In 1822 Jennings solicited a $1,000 personal loan from the Harmonists {{in a letter to his}} political ally, George Rapp, but his request was denied. Jennings was able to secure personal loans <b>from</b> <b>friends</b> by granting mortgages on his land. Earlier in his career as a land speculator at Vincennes, when land prices decreased significantly, he was forced to sell several tracts of land at a loss.|$|E

5|$|Relying {{on money}} donated by neighbors, Du Bois {{attended}} Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1885 to 1888. His travel to and residency in the South was Du Bois's {{first experience with}} Southern racism, {{which at the time}} encompassed Jim Crow laws, bigotry, suppression of black voting, and lynchings; the lattermost reached a peak in the next decade. After receiving a bachelor's degree from Fisk, he attended Harvard College (which did not accept course credits from Fisk) from 1888 to 1890, where he was strongly influenced by his professor William James, prominent in American philosophy. Du Bois paid his way through three years at Harvard with money from summer jobs, an inheritance, scholarships, and loans <b>from</b> <b>friends.</b> In 1890, Harvard awarded Du Bois his second bachelor's degree, cum laude, in history. In 1891, Du Bois received a scholarship to attend the sociology graduate school at Harvard.|$|E
5|$|The Life of Samuel Johnson or Life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D. {{was written}} by John Hawkins in 1787. It was the first full {{biography}} of Samuel Johnson—with Thomas Tyers's A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson being the first short postmortem biography. Hawkins {{was a friend of}} Johnson, but many in Johnson's circle did not like him. After Johnson's death, Hawkins was approached to produce a biography on Johnson and an edition of his works. His biography described Johnson's life, including previously unknown details about his writing career, but it was plagued by digressions into unrelated topics. Hawkins's Life of Samuel Johnson came under swift attack from critics, <b>from</b> <b>friends</b> of Johnson, and from his literary rival, James Boswell immediately after its publication. Many of the critics attacked Hawkins for his lack of strict focus on Johnson's life or for his unfavourable depiction of Johnson in various circumstances.|$|E

Finn was key in producing the fast-paced, melodic mixes, creating pop punk with a more radio-friendly, accessible polish. Lyrically, the album is inspired by adolescent frustration and relationships. Guitarist Tom DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus primarily culled stories <b>from</b> <b>friends</b> and autobiographical situations to craft summery tracks revolving around breakups, suburban parties and maturity, as well as more offbeat subject matter such as UFO conspiracy theories.

5|$|Until World War II, dining at Vassar was {{an elegant}} affair with table linens and serving maids, {{but after the}} war was over, these {{features}} were never brought back to student life. In 1973, the All Campus Dining Center, also called the ACDC or the Deece, opened within the building, serving as a replacement to individual dining rooms {{in each of the}} college's dormitories. The old system had proved too costly and overcrowded, necessitating the ACDC's creation. The $3.5 million renovation was conducted by Walker O.

5|$|On 3 March Kossuth gave a fiery {{speech in}} the Hungarian Diet, calling for a constitution. It was not until 10 March that Metternich {{appeared}} concerned about events in Vienna, where there were now threats and counter-threats flying. Two petitions were organised, calling for greater freedom, transparency, and representation. Students were involved in several demonstrations, culminating on 13 March when they cheered the royal family but voiced anger at Metternich. After a customary morning, Metternich was called to meet with Archduke Ludwig soon after midday. The Chancellor had troops sent into the streets while also announcing a prearranged and minimal concession. In the afternoon the crowd turned hostile, and a division of troops opened fire on it, killing five. The mob was now truly incited, as the liberals were joined by underprivileged Viennese set on wreaking havoc. The students offered to form a pro-government Academic Legion if their demands were met. Ludwig was eager to accept and told Metternich he must resign, to which he reluctantly agreed. After sleeping in the Chancellery he was advised to either take back his resignation or leave the city. After Ludwig sent him {{a message to the}} effect that the government could not guarantee his safety, Metternich left for the house of Count Taaffe and then, with aid <b>from</b> <b>friends</b> Charles von Hügel and Johann Rechberg, reached the family seat of Prince Liechtenstein forty miles away at Feldsberg. Metternich's daughter Leontine joined them on 21 March and suggested England as a haven; agreeing, Metternich, Melanie and 19-year-old Richard set out, leaving the younger children with Leontine. Metternich's resignation had been met with cheering in Vienna, and even the Viennese commoners welcomed the end of Metternich's era of social conservatism.|$|E

Previous experiments indicated that the low recovery rates associated with heterozygosity at H- 2 D might be related to a gene dosage effect requiring the expression of two H- 2 Db alleles for high recovery. We investigated the effects of reduced H- 2 Db expression on recovery <b>from</b> <b>Friend</b> disease by using H- 2 b homozygous mice carrying a single beta 2 -microglobulin gene disruption. These mice had reductions in cell surface H- 2 Db expression comparable to those of H- 2 Da/b heterozygotes. Numerous cell types with various levels of H- 2 Db expression were examined, and in each case, the expression levels in the beta 2 -microglobulin mutants closely reflected those observed in the H- 2 Da/b heterozygotes. We found, however, that reduced expression did not affect recovery <b>from</b> <b>Friend</b> disease, indicating that heterozygous levels of H- 2 Db expression are sufficient for the high-recovery phenotype previously associated only with H- 2 Db homozygotes...|$|R
