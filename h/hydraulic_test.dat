50|$|Hydraulic {{tomography}} (HT) is a sequential cross-hole <b>hydraulic</b> <b>test</b> {{followed by}} inversion {{of all the}} data to map the spatial distribution of aquifer hydraulic properties. Specifically, HT involves installation of multiple wells in an aquifer, which are partitioned into several intervals along the depth using packers. A sequential aquifer test at selected intervals is then conducted. During the test, water is injected or withdrawn (i.e., a pressure excitation) at a selected interval in a given well. Pressure responses of the subsurface are then monitored at other intervals at this well and other wells. This test produces a set of pressure excitation/response data of the subsurface. Once a test is completed, the pump is moved to another interval and the test is repeated to collect another set of data. The same procedure is then applied to the intervals at other wells. Afterward, the data sets from all tests are processed by a mathematical model to estimate the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties of the aquifer. These pairs of pumping and drawdown data sets at different locations make an inverse problem better posed since each pair cross-validates the others such that the estimates become less non-unique. In other words, predictions of ground water flow based on the HT estimates will be more accurate and less uncertain than those based on estimates from traditional site-characterization approaches and model calibrations.|$|E

40|$|When a {{fracture}} system in crystalline rock is grouted the rock mass may deform. Such deformations {{may reduce the}} grouting efficiency since new flow paths are opened. The work presented here show that deformations occur at <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tests</b> and grouting and that deformation can be measured and evaluated as stiffness from in situ <b>tests.</b> Deformation measurements, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>testing,</b> and grouting was conducted in spring 2010 in the Hallandsås tunnel and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>testing</b> in a service tunnel in Gothenburg (Runslätt and Thörn, 2010). For measuring physical deformation recently developed equipment from Chalmers University of Technology was used. Deformations were measured seven times in the same borehole. Three measurements were during grouting, and the remaining four from water pressure tests. Most deformations occurred at pump pressures of 1 - 1. 4 MPa, which {{is lower than the}} calculated normal rock stress. Stiffness has been evaluated in several ways, including a new method, (Fransson, et al., 2010). Generally the evaluated stiffness is lower in the Hallandsås tunnel than in the Gothenburg tunnel.

40|$|In {{connection}} with hydro-power development at Tranche, Quebec, series of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tests</b> {{were performed on}} {{a model of the}} spillway in Hydraulics Laboratory of the Ecole Polytechnique de Montréal. The resulting discharge coefficient-versus-head curves for floodways Nos. 1, 2 and 3 were quite consistent and satisfactory except those for floodway No. 4, where repeated tests showed irregularities and deviations. All the above curves are given on page 12 of this thesis. The object of this thesis is to explain the deviations of the curves for floodway No. 4, employing detailed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tests</b> and investigations. First part of the investigations consisted of the following: a) Measurements and plot of free surface profile. b) Measurements of pressure on the downstream face of the spillway. c) Measurements of the flow velocity along streamlines and throughout the nappe. During all above measurements and investigations, the upstream river bottom topography of the model was left unchanged. A converging of streamlines and angularity of flow was found to be existing, as represented on page 34. This observation as well as other data of investigations necessitated certain changes in the topography of the upstream river bottom. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>tests</b> run after the changes showed considerable improved discharge coefficient and head relations, though some irregularities were still existing.
