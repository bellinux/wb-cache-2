The binary's orbit is <b>extremely</b> <b>close,</b> at 650km, compared to 35,000km for the primary's Hill sphere. The largest Jupiter trojan—624 Hektor— is probably a contact binary with a moonlet.|$|E

5000|$|Wockenfuss may be {{best remembered}} for his use of an unusual batting stance: <b>extremely</b> <b>closed</b> with his back nearly to the pitcher, with arms {{extended}} well overhead. Wockenfuss adopted the closed stance in 1977, while playing winter ball at Caguas, Puerto Rico. His other claim to fame was Chicago Cubs broadcaster Harry Carry pronouncing his name backwards as [...] "suffnecow".|$|R

Strongly closed sets are used to characterize Hausdorff spaces and Urysohn spaces, and with these characterizations two results obtained by T. Noiri are obtained by function-theoretic means rather than by point-set method...|$|R
5|$|A sungrazing comet is a comet {{that passes}} <b>extremely</b> <b>close</b> to the Sun at perihelion, {{generally}} {{within a few}} million kilometres. Although small sungrazers can be completely evaporated during such a close approach to the Sun, larger sungrazers can survive many perihelion passages. However, the strong tidal forces they experience often lead to their fragmentation.|$|E
5|$|Kalam was the {{youngest}} of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a sister, Asim Zohra (d. 1997), followed by three elder brothers: Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar (born 4 November 1916), Mustafa Kalam (d. 1999) and Kasim Mohammed (d. 1995). He was <b>extremely</b> <b>close</b> to his elder siblings and their extended families throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of money to his older relations, himself remaining a lifelong bachelor.|$|E
5|$|The first comet whose orbit {{had been}} found to take it <b>extremely</b> <b>close</b> to the Sun was the Great Comet of 1680. This comet {{was found to have}} passed just 200,000km (0.0013AU) above the Sun's surface, {{equivalent}} to about half the distance between the Earth and the Moon. It thus became the first known sungrazing comet. Its perihelion distance was just 1.3 solar radii.|$|E
40|$|This paper briefly discuses the Serbian ethnic {{community}} in Hungary, emphasizing {{the change that}} came about in the 20 th century. Namely, the community started to change from an <b>extremely</b> <b>closed,</b> in-group oriented to an open community that allows mixed marriages. Some numerical/statistical data based on censuses and data from the Orthodox Church in Hungary are provided, {{as well as the}} Serbian attitudes toward the mixed marriages, and their influences on ethnic identity preservation. Finally, the paper discusses the identity problem of children from such mixed marriages - their self-determination and how other members of the Serbian community relate to them...|$|R
40|$|The idea of {{transforming}} architecture from the concepts used in visual arts strongly {{began with the}} avant-gardes, where architecture was {{defined in terms of}} space, air and perception. From then on, the evolution of photography/visual arts and architecture has remained <b>extremely</b> <b>closed,</b> and sometimes even creating some confusion in understanding the borders between them. Since the appearance of film and movies, ›reproduction‹ of reality has become a characteristic of modern civilization. It is obviously a straight relationship between the development of photography in the early modern architecture and the way both disciplines have walked together till today...|$|R
50|$|Other Muslims view Alians as ghulat, {{because of}} their views about imam Ali. They are an <b>extremely</b> <b>closed</b> society and zealously hide their rituals. Circumcision is done when the Boy is one week old, and with 13 year's he got the first time shaved his Pubic Hair in a special ceremony, who only Male Elders are there. They married closed in the Tribe and in a young age. It is known that Alians are mysticists and believe in {{personal}} communication with God through a near-trance state. They do not use the traditional Islamic rituals, but use candles and wine.|$|R
5|$|Bethe {{managed to}} work it out on the train from New York to Schenectady. He arrived at a value of 1040MHz, <b>extremely</b> <b>close</b> to that {{obtained}} experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. He did so by realising that it was a non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculations. His paper, published in the Physical Review in August 1947 was only two pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. Hitherto, it had been assumed that the infinities meant that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required. Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary.|$|E
5|$|Carson {{first met}} Dorothy Freeman in the Summer of 1953 in Southport Island, Maine. Freeman {{had written to}} Carson {{welcoming}} her to the area when she had heard that the famous author was to become her neighbor. It {{was the beginning of}} an <b>extremely</b> <b>close</b> friendship that would last the rest of Carson's life. Their relationship was conducted mainly through letters, and during summers spent together in Maine. Over the course of 12 years, they would exchange somewhere in the region of 900 letters. Many of these were published in the book Always, Rachel, published in 1995 by Beacon Press.|$|E
5|$|Lead and tin: high density; <b>extremely</b> <b>close</b> {{dimensional}} accuracy; {{used for}} special forms of corrosion resistance. Such alloys {{are not used}} in foodservice applications for public health reasons. Type metal, an alloy of lead, tin and antimony (with sometimes traces of copper) is used for casting hand-set type in letterpress printing and hot foil blocking. Traditionally cast in hand jerk moulds now predominantly die cast after the industrialisation of the type foundries. Around 1900 the slug casting machines came onto the market and added further automation, with sometimes dozens of casting machines at one newspaper office.|$|E

5000|$|Since they {{established}} diplomatic relations, Germany and Pakistan have both enjoyed <b>extremely</b> <b>closed</b> and cordial relationships. Before the re-unification of Germany, Pakistan maintained warm and cordial relationships with both East-Germany and West-Germany. Germany {{is home to}} 35,081 Pakistani immigrants and around more than 1200 Germans currently reside in Pakistan, mostly residing in Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar. Germany maintains a healthy diplomatic presence in the country, with an embassy in Islamabad, a consulate in Karachi and honorary-consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Quetta. Germany also {{is one of the}} countries playing a vital and influential role in Pakistan's current political events, others being Saudi Arabia, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom ...|$|R

5|$|Major Hans-Günther von Kornatzki {{had formed}} an {{experimental}} unit to evaluate {{new methods of}} bomber attack. Sturmstaffel 1 consisted entirely of volunteers trained to engage the enemy bombers in <b>extremely</b> <b>close</b> quarters, utilising specially armed and up-armored Fw 190's (so-called Sturmböcke) or Battering Rams). These were intended to attack the bombers from the rear in tight arrowhead formations, closing to extreme close range, as replacements for the formerly-dedicated Zerstörer twin-engined heavy fighters, which themselves were being shot down in ever-increasing numbers by Allied escort fighters. In January 1944, the 18 Staffel unit was transferred to Dortmund where they were subordinated to Major Rudolf-Emil Schnoor and his I./JG 1.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the tournament, Homer threatens Bart to win {{no matter}} what. In an <b>extremely</b> <b>close</b> match, Bart and Todd each do well, and tie by the time they reach the eighteenth hole. Bart and Todd agree that the {{competition}} is not worth the stress, that they are equally good and that they should call it a draw, splitting the award evenly. As a result, Ned and Homer are forced to wear their respective wives' Sunday dresses and mow each other's lawn. People around the neighborhood laugh at them and Ned actually enjoys it (commenting that it reminds him of his fraternity days in college), much to Homer's dismay.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{the orbit}} of the comet showed that the Great Comet of 1882 was moving on an almost {{identical}} path to previous great comets seen in C/1843 D1 and C/1880 C1. These comets had also suddenly appeared in the morning sky and had passed <b>extremely</b> <b>close</b> to the Sun at perihelion. One suggestion was that all three were in fact the same comet, with an orbital period that was being drastically shortened at each perihelion passage. However, studies showed this to be untenable, as the orbital period of this comet is 772 ± 3 years {{and the others are}} 600–800 years.|$|E

Solaratov's bullet ends both Bob Lee's career in the Marine Corps and Donny Fenn's life.|$|R
5|$|The {{heightened}} vigilance of the German garrison {{as the war}} entered {{its final}} phase made these operations especially hazardous, particularly as they were often attempted at <b>extremely</b> <b>close</b> quarters. On several occasions Rhodesian patrols only narrowly escaped discovery. During one action, two Rhodesian patrols catered {{for the possibility that}} Germans might be listening to their transmissions by communicating in Shona, an African language. The LRDG's last actions of the war, in April and May 1945, were to help Tito's partisans capture German-held islands off Dalmatia.|$|E
5|$|Further {{north in}} Lysander, NY48 crosses the CSX Transportation-owned Baldwinsville Subdivision {{before turning to}} the {{northeast}} as it passes through the hamlet of Wrights Corners and entering Oswego County. Just past the county line in Granby, the route turns northwest, following the western bank the Oswego River (and paralleling County Route57 or CR57 on the opposite side) as it intersects CR46 near the hamlet of Hinmansville. NY48 continues along the riverbank {{to the city of}} Fulton, where it gains the name West First Street south of an intersection with NY176. Like NY31 in Baldwinsville, NY48 originally overlapped NY176 north to NY3 (Broadway), where NY176 continued east. Now, however, NY176 ends here and NY48 continues solo to NY3. Past Broadway, NY48 proceeds north through the remainder of Fulton, now paralleling NY481 <b>extremely</b> <b>close</b> with just Oswego River separating the two.|$|E
5|$|Attendees at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943 {{took the}} {{decision}} to launch a cross-Channel invasion within the next year. Churchill favoured making the main Allied thrust into Germany from the Mediterranean theatre, but his American allies, who were providing {{the bulk of the}} men and equipment, over-ruled him. British Lieutenant-General Frederick E. Morgan was appointed Chief of Staff, Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC), to begin detailed planning. The initial plans were constrained by the number of available landing-craft, most of which were already committed in the Mediterranean and in the Pacific. In part because of lessons learned in the Dieppe Raid of 19 August 1942, the Allies decided not to directly assault a heavily defended French seaport in their first landing. The failure at Dieppe also highlighted the need for adequate artillery and air support, particularly close air support, and specialised ships able to travel <b>extremely</b> <b>close</b> to shore. The short operating-range of British aircraft such as the Spitfire and Typhoon greatly limited the number of potential landing-sites, as comprehensive air-support depended upon having planes overhead for as long as possible. Morgan considered four sites for the landings: Brittany, the Cotentin Peninsula, Normandy, and the Pas de Calais. As Brittany and Cotentin are peninsulas, the Germans could have cut off the Allied advance at a relatively narrow isthmus, so these sites were rejected.|$|E
40|$|Insularity {{is often}} {{interpreted}} {{as a model of}} segregation and isolation. Islands are considered as “closed” spaces. Ports, on the contrary, being the doors between sea and land, are archetypical figures of “openness”. Without doubt, ports have always been vital elements for islands both as gateways and as essential public spaces. Yet, within the open space of insular ports, one can find <b>extremely</b> <b>closed</b> enclaves: small islands within the islands hosting prisons, lazaretos for contagious diseases, centres for the selection of immigrants. Insular places of denied liberty stand {{right in the middle of}} the flux of goods and people freely passing through the ports. Ellis Island, within the port of New York, and Isla del Lazareto, in the port of Mahón (Minorca), are historical examples of such places. The relationship between insularity and portuality reproduces, therefore, a complex dialectics between geographic relations and isolation...|$|R
40|$|There are {{extremely}} few publications in our periodic press that seriously analyze the military economy, {{the economics of}} the armed forces, and the state and problems of military management. The principal, but not the only, reason for this situation is the level of >i>glasnost'>/i>. The <b>extremely</b> <b>closed</b> nature of military-economic practice has been and continues to be detrimental both to the national economy and to economic science. This has led to a certain degree of isolation of military economists from union and world science, to the estrangement of scientists from one another, and to the exaggerated level of politization of the study of economic disciplines in military educational institutions. Not a single scientific research institute is engaged in the analysis of military economics, even though expenditures on defense comprise a very appreciable share in the state budget, through which practically all activity, including the nonproductive sphere, has been financed. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{that same}} year, Edmund Grey, {{the son of}} a Marick family maid and gardener, returns to town to see his {{childhood}} friend, Angelique. Dimitri is furious to see Edmund again since he had stolen money from Dimitri's father to pay for his education. Dimitri is stunned when Edmund informs him that they are half-brothers. Edmund had discovered this when he found a will of Hugo Marick that states he is not only his illegitimate son, but that he is the lawful heir to Wildwind. Helga had planted the will because she believed Dimitri was going to leave Angelique for Erica. When Dimitri assures Helga he will stay with Angelique, she destroys the will {{in order to keep the}} estate for her daughter. Edmund accuses Dimitri of stealing the will and files a lawsuit to have Hugo's body exhumed in order to perform a DNA test. Dimitri believes Edmund is lying about everything and is infuriated by the lawsuit. The hatred between the two deepens even more. Eventually, the truth about what Helga did is revealed and she dies. Dimitri and Edmund agree to put the past behind them and they bond as brothers. They develop an <b>extremely</b> <b>close</b> and loving relationship, but they also continue to have a standing rivalry.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen's {{chemical}} properties {{are not very}} close {{to those of the}} alkali metals, which occupy group 1, and on that basis hydrogen is sometimes placed elsewhere: {{one of the most common}} alternatives is in group 17; one of the factors behind it is the strictly univalent predominantly non-metallic chemistry of hydrogen, and that of fluorine (the element placed on the top of group 17) is strictly univalent and non-metallic. Sometimes, to show how hydrogen has properties both corresponding to those of the alkali metals and the halogens, it may be shown in two columns simultaneously. Another suggestion is above carbon in group 14: placed that way, it fits well into the trends of increasing ionization potential values and electron affinity values, and is not too far from the electronegativity trend, even though hydrogen cannot show the tetravalence characteristic of the heavier group 14 elements. Finally, hydrogen is sometimes placed separately from any group; this is based on how general properties of hydrogen differ from that of any group. The other period 1 element, helium, is sometimes placed separately from any group as well. The property that distinguishes helium from the rest of the noble gases (even though the extraordinary inertness of helium is <b>extremely</b> <b>close</b> to that of neon and argon) is that in its closed electron shell, helium has only two electrons in the outermost electron orbital, while the rest of the noble gases have eight.|$|E
5|$|No genetic {{studies to}} date have {{correlated}} these prehistoric remains to any modern breed. What has been studied are Y-chromosomes (Y-DNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) obtained from Exmoor ponies. The Y-chromosome is passed on through the male line, and worldwide shows very little genetic variation in horses, except for a second Y-chromosome haplotype found in China, suggesting that a very limited number of stallions contributed to the original genome of the domestic horse. The Exmoor pony shares this general Y-chromosome haplotype. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA is passed on though the female line, and shows far more variation than Y-DNA, indicating {{that a large number}} of wild mares from several regions have contributed to modern domestic breeds. Some mtDNA-haplotypes have been found in DNA samples obtained from wild horses in prehistoric deposits, while other mtDNA-haplotypes have only been found in domesticated horses, from both living individuals and archeological finds. The Exmoor pony has a high frequency of pre-domestication mtDNA-haplotypes, but these are also found in different breeds all around the world. Currently, for the British Isles, there are only three DNA archeological samples available, all from Ireland. Although wild horses were abundant after the last ice age, the lack of sufficient pre-domestication DNA samples makes it impossible to determine the contribution of the wild horses of the British Islands to modern breeds, including the Exmoor pony. A 1995 study of morphological characteristics, the outward appearance of organisms, indicated that the Exmoor, Pottock, and Tarpan have an <b>extremely</b> <b>close</b> resemblance; these breeds were consistently grouped together in the results from several analyses, with the Exmoor showing the closest relationship to the Tarpan of all the breeds studied, at 0.27; the next-closest breeds to the Tarpan were the Pottock and Merens, both with a genetic distance from the Tarpan of 0.47. The distance between the Exmoor and Pottock was 0.37, and between the Exmoor and Merens was 0.40; a significantly wider gap than the distance between the Exmoor and Tarpan.|$|E

40|$|Nestmate {{recognition}} was {{studied in}} the polydomous ant Cataglyphis iberica (Formicinae) in the laboratory. The study examined six colonies collected from two different populations 600 km apart in the Iberian peninsula (Barcelona and Murcia). Introduction of an alien worker into an allocolonial arena always ended in death to the intruder, demonstrating that in this species societies are <b>extremely</b> <b>closed.</b> Dyadic encounters composed of individuals from different colonies in a neutral arena confirmed the existence of high aggression between allocolonial individuals. We also investigated variability {{in the composition of}} the major cuticular hydrocarbons between the colonies used in the behavioral tests. There were marked quantitative differences between the profiles of ants from the two populations, suggesting that the populations are completely segregated. Cuticular profiles within a population tended to be more similar, but were nevertheless colony specific. The degree of colony closure in C. iberica seemed to be independent of geographic distance since aggression between the colonies was always at its maximum, irrespective of their population origin.
