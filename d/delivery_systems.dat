5|$|The USAF {{issued a}} new policy {{directive}} regarding the handling {{of nuclear weapons and}} <b>delivery</b> <b>systems,</b> which prohibits the storing of nuclear armed and nonnuclear armed weapons in the same storage facility. The directive further instructs that all nonnuclear munitions and missiles must be labeled with placards clearly stating that they are not armed with nuclear warheads. Wing commanders are now charged with approving any movement of nuclear weapons from weapons storage areas and must appoint a single individual as a munitions accountability system officer and weapons custodian. All units that handle nuclear weapons must develop a coordinated visual inspection checklist. The policy further directs that airmen charged with handling or maintaining nuclear weapons cannot be on duty for longer than 12 hours, unless during an emergency, when their duty period can be extended to a maximum of 16 hours. The USAF has since instituted a program of surprise inspections at nuclear-armed bases.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{received its}} fifth KC-30 on 3December 2012, and achieved {{initial operating capability}} in February 2013. It expected to reach final operating capability, with both boom and probe-and-drogue <b>delivery</b> <b>systems,</b> in 2014. On 14September that year, the Federal government committed to deploying one of the squadron's KC-30s to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, {{as part of a}} coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. The aircraft was only cleared for operations with the probe-and-drogue system, as by this stage the boom system was not ready. The KC-30 began flying missions in Iraq on 1October 2014. The first successful contact using the boom system (in concert with another RAAF KC-30) took place near Amberley on 13May 2015. In July, the Federal government announced the purchase of two more KC-30s for delivery in 2018, taking No.33 Squadron's fleet to seven aircraft; the airframes were to be ex-Qantas A330-200 passenger liners, converted by Airbus Defence and Space at Getafe, near Madrid. The KC-30 deployed to Iraq undertook the first operational use of the boom system in late October 2015, refuelling an RAAF E-7 Wedgetail. In March 2016, No.33 Squadron was awarded the Duke of Gloucester Cup as the RAAF's most proficient squadron of the previous year, as well as the RAAF Maintenance Trophy.|$|E
