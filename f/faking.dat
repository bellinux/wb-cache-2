40|$|Executive Summary This {{submission}} provides {{evidence on}} four aspects: 1. What {{do we know}} about <b>fake</b> news, <b>fake</b> profiles/accounts, and <b>fake</b> attention on social media? 2. What are the causes of <b>fake</b> news, political bots and <b>fake</b> social media accounts? 3. What are the problems and impacts of <b>fake</b> news, political bots and <b>fake</b> accounts? 4. What can be done against <b>fake</b> news culture? This submission gives special attention to the role of online advertising in <b>fake</b> news culture. (§§ 1. 1 - 1. 16) Reports, research and analyses suggest that <b>fake</b> news, automated social media bots that post content online and <b>fake</b> online attention, as well as <b>fake</b> profiles {{play a significant role in}} political communication on social media. (§§ 2. 1 - 2. 6) The proliferation of <b>fake</b> news, political bots and <b>fake</b> accounts on social media has interacting economic, political and ideological causes. There are no technological fixes to the problems associated with <b>fake</b> news. (§§ 3. 1 - 3. 5) There are a number of potential problems associated with <b>fake</b> news, political bots and <b>fake</b> accounts that can limit and negatively impact the public sphere: the undermining of human communication’s validity claims; threats to democracy; one-dimensional, instrumental, highly polarised and symbolically/communicatively violent politics; spirals of intensifying political aggression and violence. (§§ 4. 1 - 4. 12) There is a number of feasible measures that can be taken in order to challenge <b>fake</b> news culture. These include: Outlawing targeted and behavioural political online advertising, the substitution of algorithmic activity by paid human work of fact-checkers and knowledge professionals, the legal requirement to introduce a <b>fake</b> news alert button, providing support to new types of online platforms and new formats that decelerate news and political communication and act as slow media, the advancement of and support for public service Internet platforms, giving the BBC an important role in advancing public service Internet platforms that foster advertising-free political debate that challenges <b>fake</b> news, the introduction of an online advertising tax on all ads targeted at users accessing the Internet in the UK in order to provide a resource base for funding public service and alternative Internet platforms that foster a new culture of political debate...|$|R

5000|$|The {{twenty-first century}} motivations behind <b>fake</b> news {{are due to}} {{increasing}} financial profits. In an interview with NPR, Jestin Coler, former CEO of the <b>fake</b> media conglomerate Disinfomedia, revealed who writes <b>fake</b> news articles, who funds these articles, and why <b>fake</b> news creators create and distribute false information. Coler, who has since left {{his role as a}} <b>fake</b> news creator, shared that his company employed anywhere from 20 to 25 writers at a time and made $10,000 to $30,000 monthly from advertisements. Coler began his career in journalism as a magazine salesman before working as a freelance writer, but launched into the <b>fake</b> news industry to prove to himself and others just how rapidly <b>fake</b> news can spread. Disinfomedia is not the only outlet responsible for the distribution of <b>fake</b> news; Facebook users {{play a major role in}} feeding into <b>fake</b> news stories by making sensationalized stories [...] "trend", according to BuzzFeed media editor Craig Silverman, and the individuals behind Google AdSense basically fund <b>fake</b> news websites and their content.
