40|$|The EBR-II is a pool-type design; {{the reactor}} <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> {{components}} and entire primary-sodium coolant system are submerged {{in the primary}} tank, which is 26 feet in diameter, 26 feet high, and contains 86, 000 gallons of sodium. Since the reactor is submerged in sodium, <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> operations must be performed blind, making exact positioning and precision control of the <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> system components essential. EBR-II operated for 30 years, and the <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> system has performed approximately 25, 000 fuel transfer operations in that time. Due to termination of the IFR program, EBR-II was shut down on September 30, 1994. In preparation for decommissioning, all fuel in the reactor will be transferred out of EBR-II to interim storage. This intensive <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> campaign will last approximately two years, {{and the number of}} transfers will be equivalent to the <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> done over about nine years of normal reactor operation. With this demand on the system, system reliability will be extremely important. Because of this increased demand, and considering that the system has been operating for about 32 years, system upgrades to increase reliability and efficiency are proceeding. Upgrades to the system to install new digital, solid state controls, and to take advantage of new visualization technology, are underway. Future reactor designs using liquid metal coolant will be able to incorporate imaging technology now being investigated, such as ultraviolet laser imaging and ultrasonic imaging...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 45) This study determined {{an acceptable}} {{design of a}} <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> machine to refuel future liquid metal fast breeder reactors (LMFBR). To date, approximately seven <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> machines have been designed' and built for small scale liquid metal cooled reactors. Limitations of these previously operated handling devices eliminated their use for, the LMFBR. A study was therefore performed to establish a simple machine to meet the more stringent design safety criteria for the future LMFBR spent fuel assemblies. This study was however restricted to only those aspects of the design believed to be particularly critical for such a <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> machine. Once these critical design: aspects are satisfied, the detailed design can be prepared by more conventional design techniques. Fuel assemblies from the reactor must be removed periodically and, replaced with new fuel assemblies. The heat generated by the fission products in these spent fuel assemblies can cause the assemblies to melt unless adequate cooling is provided. The cooling system is therefore the most critical component of the <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> machine. Since provision for adequate heat removal from a spent fuel assembly is the most critical aspect of the design, two independent heat removal systems are suggested to provide near complete redundancy. Each heat transfer system must be capable of removing the entire 27 Kw generated internally in the spent assembly being removed. Sodium in the liquid state is used to transfer heat from the fuel assembly to the outside surface of the transfer container. In {{one of the two}} independent cooling systems, all of the decay heat is transferred froi the outside surface of the transfer container to an air-cooled cold wall by radiation. In the second cooling system, cold argon is pumped around the transfer container and through an air-to-argon heat exchanger to remove all of the decay heat of the spent fuel assembly by convection. Selection of the shielding material and the shielding dimension is the second critical design problem considered. The choice for shielding material is based on raw material costs, ease of fabrication, and shielding performance. No definitive answer exists to this selection problem, but this study showed that cast steel would be the best shielding material for this application. A flexible member must be used to raise and lower the <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> machine's grapple {{into and out of the}} reactor liquid sodium. To date none of the liquid metal reactor <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> machines have been designed with this constraint. The design of this component represented the third critical aspect of the design of the machine. The results show that log chain would be the best choice of the five alternative considered. A design concept for a IMFBR <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> machine evolved as a consequence of the results obtained by examination of the three critical design considerations discussed above...|$|R

The FRS will be used to retrieve and repackage K-Basin Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) currently stored in old K-Plant storage basins. The FRS is required to retrieve full fuel canisters from the basin, clean the fuel elements inside the canister to remove excessive uranium corrosion products (or sludge), remove the contents from the canisters and sort the resulting debris, scrap, and fuel for repackaging. The fuel elements and scrap will be collected in fuel storage and scrap baskets in preparation for loading into a multi canister overpack (MCO), while the debris is loaded into a debris bin and disposed of as solid waste.

40|$|The {{research}} for technological improvement and innovation in sodium-cooled fast reactor {{is a matter}} of concern in <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> systems in a view to perform a better load factor of the reactor thanks to a quicker fuelling/defueling process.

In those three FHR, two use a gas corridor to transfer spent and fresh fuel assembly and the third uses two casks with a sodium pot to evacuate and load an assembly in parallel. All of them are designed for the ASTRID reactor (1500 [*]MWth) but can be extrapolated to power reactors and are compatible with the mutualisation of one FHS coupled with two reactors. These three concepts are then intercompared and evaluated with the reference FHR according to four criteria: performances, risk assessment, investment cost, and qualification time. This analysis reveals that the “mixed way” FHR presents interesting solutions mainly in terms of design simplicity and time reduction.

The project will retrieve spent nuclear fuel, clean and remove fuel from canisters, repackage fuel into baskets, and load fuel into a multi-canister overpack (MCO) for vacuum drying and interim dry storage. The FRS is required to retrieve basin fuel canisters, clean fuel elements sufficiently of uranium corrosion products (or sludge), empty fuel from canisters, sort debris and scrap from whole elements, and repackage fuel in baskets in preparation for MCO loading. The purpose of <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> {{development testing}} was to examine the systems ability to accomplish mission activities, optimization of equipment layouts for initial process definition, identification of special needs/tools, verification of required design changes to support performance specification development, and validation of estimated activity times/throughput.

The equilibrium states used in the assessment are determined by a one-group transmutation code with cross sections prepared by the WIMS 8 code (for transuranics below 246 Cm) and ENDF/B-V data (for 246 Cm and above). The <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> indices suggest that Pu multi-recycling is feasible. However, the high radiotoxicity of the spent assembly content suggests that Pu multi-recycling would provide only minimal benefits to the repository if the goal is to reduce the radiotoxicity of the disposed waste to less than that of the source uranium used in producing the fuel in a thousand years. TRU multi-recycling is the most beneficial to the repository because the amount of TRU in the disposed waste is significantly reduced by keeping the TRU in the PWR fuel cycle.

40|$|In earlier studies, {{zinc ferrite}} and zinc {{titanate}} were developed as regenerable sorbents capable of removing hydrogen sulfide from <b>hot</b> <b>fuel</b> gases originating from coal gasification. Manganese ore {{as well as}} manganese carbonate, precipitated from aqueous solutions, combined with alumina to form indurated pellets hold promise of being a highly-effective, inexpensive, regenerable sorbent for <b>hot</b> <b>fuel</b> gases. Although the thermodynamics for sulfur removal by manganese predicts somewhat higher hydrogen sulfide over-pressures (i. e. poorer degree of desulfurization) than can be accomplished with zinc-based sorbents, zinc tends to be reduced to the metallic state under coal gasification conditions resulting in loss of capacity and reactivity by volatilization of reactive surfaces. This volatilization phenomenon limits the temperatures for which desulfurization can be effectively accomplished to less than 500 C for zinc ferrite and 700 C for zinc titanate; whereas, manganese-based sorbents can be utilized at temperatures well in temperatures exceeding 700 C. Also the regeneration of manganese-based pellets under oxidizing conditions may be superior to that of zinc titanate since they can be loaded from a simulated reducing coal-derived gas and then be regenerated at higher temperatures (up to 1, 300 C).
