Slope detection demodulates an FM signal by using a tuned circuit which has its resonant frequency slightly offset from the carrier.

5000|$|A {{variant of}} the <b>Foster-Seeley</b> <b>discriminator</b> called the ratio {{detector}} ...|$|E
50|$|The ratio {{detector}} is {{a variant of}} the <b>Foster-Seeley</b> <b>discriminator,</b> but one diode conducts in an opposite direction, and using a tertiary winding in the preceding transformer. The output in this case is taken between the sum of the diode voltages and the center tap. The output across the diodes is connected to a large value capacitor, which eliminates AM noise in the {{ratio detector}} output. The ratio detector has the advantage over the <b>Foster-Seeley</b> <b>discriminator</b> that it will not respond to AM signals, thus potentially saving a limiter stage; however the output is only 50% of the output of a discriminator for the same input signal. The ratio detector has wider bandwidth but more distortion than the <b>Foster-Seeley</b> <b>discriminator.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Foster-Seeley</b> <b>discriminators</b> are {{sensitive}} to both frequency and amplitude variations, unlike some detectors. Therefore a limiter amplifier stage must be used before the detector, to remove amplitude variations in the signal which would be detected as noise. The limiter acts as a class-A amplifier at lower amplitudes; at higher amplitudes it becomes a saturated amplifier which clips off the peaks and limits the amplitude.|$|R
50|$|Stuart William Seeley (June 23, 1901 - November 4, 1978) was a noted American {{electrical}} engineer, {{best known}} for inventing the <b>Foster-Seeley</b> <b>discriminator</b> and SHORAN.|$|E
50|$|In 1936 Seeley {{invented the}} <b>Foster-Seeley</b> <b>discriminator</b> with D. E. Foster, {{publishing}} details in 1937. It helped {{reduce the cost}} of FM radio receivers to a level comparable to AM receivers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} is a <b>Foster-Seeley</b> <b>discriminator.</b> This is {{composed}} of an electronic filter which decreases the amplitude of some frequencies relative to others, followed by an AM demodulator. If the filter response changes linearly with frequency, the final analog output will be proportional to the input frequency, as desired.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Foster-Seeley</b> <b>discriminator</b> is {{a widely}} used FM {{detector}}. The detector consists of a special center-tapped transformer feeding two diodes in a full wave DC rectifier circuit. When the input transformer is tuned to the signal frequency, {{the output of the}} discriminator is zero. When there is no deviation of the carrier, both halves of the center tapped transformer are balanced. As the FM signal swings in frequency above and below the carrier frequency, the balance between the two halves of the center-tapped secondary is destroyed and there is an output voltage proportional to the frequency deviation.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Foster-Seeley</b> <b>discriminator</b> is {{a common}} type of FM {{detector}} circuit, invented in 1936 by Dudley E. Foster and Stuart William Seeley. The circuit was envisioned for automatic frequency control of receivers, but also found application in demodulating an FM signal. It uses a tuned RF transformer to convert frequency changes into amplitude changes. A transformer, tuned to the carrier frequency, is connected to two rectifier diodes. The circuit resembles a full-wave bridge rectifier. If the input equals the carrier frequency, {{the two halves of}} the tuned transformer circuit produce the same rectified voltage and the output is zero. As the frequency of the input changes, the balance between the two halves of the transformer secondary changes, and the result is a voltage proportional to the frequency deviation of the carrier.|$|E
