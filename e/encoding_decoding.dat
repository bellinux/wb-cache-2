5000|$|A {{signal lamp}} (also called an Aldis lamp) is a visual {{signaling}} device for optical communicationIn the U.S. Navy, [...] "signalman" [...] (nicknamed [...] "Sigs", [...] "Flags", or [...] "Skivvy Waver") {{was a job}} field combining both visual communications, and advanced lookout skills. While there was certainly a Signalman rating before World War II (the Signalman rating {{is one of the}} oldest in the Navy), a specialized Signalman rating was established shortly after the war. Then, Signalmen were identified by the symbol of two crossed semaphore flags on the left sleeve of the uniform, integrated with their rank insignia. Signalmen were responsible for transmitting, receiving, <b>encoding,</b> <b>decoding,</b> and distributing messages obtained via the visual transmission systems of flag semaphore, visual morse code, and flaghoist signalling. The U.S. Navy disestablished the rating of Signalman in late 2003, reassigning visual communications duties to the Quartermaster rating. Signalmen were either absorbed into the Quartermaster rating, or allowed to switch to other job fields in the Navy. Many chose the Master-at-Arms rating, which expanded dramatically to meet the needs of the Navy in the War on Terror.|$|E
40|$|Causal {{terminology}} {{is often}} {{introduced in the}} interpretation of <b>encoding</b> and <b>decoding</b> models trained on neuroimaging data. In this article, we investigate which causal statements are warranted and which ones are not supported by empirical evidence. We argue that the distinction between <b>encoding</b> and <b>decoding</b> models is not sufficient for this purpose: relevant features in <b>encoding</b> and <b>decoding</b> models carry a different meaning in stimulus- and in response-based experimental paradigms. We show that only encoding models in the stimulus-based setting support unambiguous causal interpretations. By combining <b>encoding</b> and <b>decoding</b> models trained on the same data, however, we obtain insights into causal relations beyond those that are implied by each individual model type. We illustrate the empirical relevance of our theoretical findings on EEG data recorded during a visuo-motor learning task. Comment: accepted manuscrip...|$|R

The objective is to choose designs, i. e. real-time <b>encoding,</b> <b>decoding</b> and memory update strategies that minimize a total expected distortion measure. This is a dynamic team problem with non-classical information structure [7]. We use the structural results of [4] to develop a sequential decomposition for the finite and infinite horizon problems. Thus, we obtain a systematic methodology for the determination of jointly optimal <b>encoding</b> <b>decoding</b> and memory update strategies for real-time point-to-point communication...|$|E
