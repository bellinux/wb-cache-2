5|$|A {{number of}} subtypes of Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} are recognized. Despite this, {{many people have}} overlapping symptoms that can make the classification difficult in individual cases. All types have partial forms. For instance, some people experience only isolated eye-movement or coordination problems; these {{are thought to be}} a subtype of Miller Fisher syndrome and <b>have</b> <b>similar</b> antiganglioside antibody patterns.|$|E
5|$|Chloroacetone turns brown-orange {{when exposed}} to light, while ethyl bromoacetate is a yellow liquid at {{tropical}} outdoor temperatures. Both <b>have</b> <b>similar</b> colors to the liquid used on the demonstrators. Some varieties of French tear gas contained phosgene oxime or hydrogen cyanide.

As long as a freely licensed Deseret alphabet font and a font of the standard orthography <b>have</b> <b>similar</b> inked surface areas, printing a book in the Deseret alphabet using modern technology would have a similar cost as printing a book in the standard orthography.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that many}} optical peaks in diamond accidentally <b>have</b> <b>similar</b> {{spectral}} positions, which causes much confusion among gemologists.

This thesis used legal normative and descriptive analytic method. Legal remedy {{can be made by}} the registered brand holder on the violation against his brand which <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> basic element based on Law No. 15 / 2001 by filing a complaint to the Court of Commerce on the withdrawal of the product with the brand which <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> basic element or by filing a compensation for the person who has registered the brand which <b>has</b> <b>similar</b> basic element.
