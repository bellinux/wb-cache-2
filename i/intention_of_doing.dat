5|$|The Brick Lane {{screening}} – on 8 December 1995 – {{had been}} previewed in NME, and was chaotically busy. It was originally planned {{for a car}} park, but freezing conditions and snow forced a rethink and the screening was moved indoors, to {{the basement of the}} nearby Seven Stars pub. Hundreds of people crammed in to watch the screening, which was eventually abandoned partway through due to the cramped conditions. The NME preview had claimed that after the screening the film would be cut up and individual frames sold off to the public. Gimpo, the owner of the film, had no <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so, but after the screening was nearly overwhelmed by a mob of people wanting to take home a piece of the film.|$|E
5|$|The concept {{behind a}} Qualifying Industrial Zone is {{credited}} to Omar Salah, a Jordanian businessman. In 1993, {{in anticipation of}} the Israel–Jordan peace treaty, Salah traveled to Israel with the <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> business with Israeli businessmen. He was also interested in business ventures that could take advantage of the eight-year-old free trade agreement between the United States and Israel that allowed Israeli goods to enter the US markets duty-free. After the treaty was signed in 1994, a business venture was struck between Salah and Delta Galil, where labor was transferred to Irbid in northern Jordan, to take advantage of low labor costs that were forty to seventy percent lower than in Israel. Salah had envisioned that by exploiting Israeli resources such as labor, finances, and contacts, and then leveraging it to produce value-added goods, the economy of Jordan would be benefited. In addition, he surmised that economic cooperation between the two nations would help foster peace in the region.|$|E

However, she showed sympathy to the state she had brought upon him. Before she left, Gi-tae expressed his belief that she was the last person she met and asked what Jin-soo had said to her. Eun-suh said that Jin-soo had told her not to involve her Gi-tae over this matter.|$|R
25|$|When Tobin {{attempted}} to obtain AFL {{endorsement of the}} candidacy of Democrat Alfred E. Smith in the 1928 presidential election, AFL President William Green forced a resolution through the AFL Executive Council which reaffirmed the federation's nonpartisan policy. Tobin resigned as treasurer of the AFL in anger. Although Green and others feared the Teamsters might withdraw from the federation, Tobin assured the Executive Council he had no <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so.|$|E

This was initialled by Seely, French and Ewart and then given to Gough. It is unclear whether this – amending a Cabinet document without Cabinet approval – was an honest blunder on Seely’s part or whether he was encouraged to do so and then made a scapegoat.|$|E
25|$|Skinny Puppy {{formed in}} 1982 {{as a side}} project for Kevin Crompton in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Crompton was {{dissatisfied}} with the pop direction of his then-current band Images in Vogue, and began Skinny Puppy with the <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> something more compelling and experimental. Images in Vogue had become a popular act in Vancouver, achieving several radio hits and opening for groups such as Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, and Roxy Music. Initially Crompton had planned Skinny Puppy to be a side project while he continued his work in Images in Vogue; however, when Images in Vogue later relocated to Toronto, Crompton made Skinny Puppy his full-time project. Crompton had already created the name for the project and recorded several songs when he asked Kevin Graham Ogilvie to join. Ogilvie had been a roommate of Images in Vogue member Gary Blair Smith and had met Crompton {{at a party in}} late 1982. To avoid the confusion of having two people named Kevin in one band, the pair created stage names, with Crompton becoming cEvin Key and Ogilvie becoming Nivek Ogre.|$|E

500|$|Rudel {{was married}} three times. His 1942 {{marriage}} to Ursula, nicknamed [...] "Hanne", produced two sons, Hans-Ulrich and Siegfried. They divorced in 1950. According {{to the news}} magazine Der Spiegel, {{one reason for the}} divorce was that his wife had sold some of his decorations, including the Oak Leaves with Diamonds, to an American collector, but she also refused to move to Argentina. On 27 March 1951, Der Spiegel published Ursula Rudel's denial of selling his decorations, and further stated she had no <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so. Rudel married his second wife, Ursula née Daemisch in 1965. The marriage produced his third son, Christoph, born in 1969. A year later, Rudel survived a stroke on 26 April 1970. Following his divorce in 1977, he married Ursula née Bassfeld.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 29 October, Mugabe and Nkomo spoke in turn, giving emotionally charged speeches about the [...] "dreadful sacrifices which the white governments have exacted from the poor black people". Neither made any comment {{relevant}} to a new constitution. Muzorewa then {{told the story of}} the life of the Ndebele King Lobengula in reverent tones, before Sithole made the only directly relevant nationalist contribution of the day, saying simply that he hoped the two sides could come to an agreement. A few days' break were then agreed as constitutional lawyers drew up a plan based on Kissinger's for the delegates to discuss. The American election result came through on {{the morning of}} 2 November 1976; as expected, Carter had won. In Geneva, meanwhile, it soon became clear that while the Rhodesians wished to stick to the plan they had agreed with Kissinger, the nationalists had no <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so, regarding those terms only as a starting point for further negotiation. They continually interrupted the lawyers' work with new demands, meaning that by 8 November practically no progress had been made.|$|E

500|$|The {{extended}} shooting schedule owed much to {{the fact}} that scenes where ghosts and human characters interacted had to be filmed twice; once with human characters acting on set, and then with the ghost characters acting against a blue screen. The two elements would later be digitally composited into one shot with the use of split screen photography. Such sequences required precise timing from the cast as they traded dialogue with characters who were merely blank air. The hardest challenge for the digital animators at Weta was creating the Grim Reaper, which went through many transformations before finding physical form. [...] "We set out with the <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> the Reaper as a rod puppet, maybe shooting it in a water tank," [...] Jackson commented. [...] "We even thought of filming someone, dressed in costume, at different camera speeds." [...] Test footage was shot with puppets and a man in a Reaper suit, but in the end, it was decided that using computer animation would be the easiest task. Another entirely computerized character called [...] "the Gatekeeper", a winged cherub who helps guard the cemetery, was deleted from the final cut.|$|E

Grahame-Smith met with Keaton in February 2012, [...] "We talked {{for a couple of hours}} and talked about big picture stuff. It's a priority for Warner Bros. It's a priority for Tim. [...] been wanting to do it for 20 years and he'll talk to anybody about it who will listen." [...] The story will be set in a real time frame from 1988; [...] "This will be a true 26 or 27 years later sequel.

500|$|On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland {{under the}} false pretext that the Poles had {{carried out a}} series of {{sabotage}} operations against German targets near the border. Two days later, on 3 September, after a British ultimatum to Germany to cease military operations was ignored, Britain and France, followed by the fully independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth—Australia (3 September), Canada (10 September), New Zealand (3 September), and South Africa (6 September)—declared war on Germany. However, initially the alliance provided limited direct military support to Poland, consisting of a cautious, half-hearted French probe into the Saarland., observes that, {{while it is true that}} Poland was far away, making it difficult for the French and British to provide support, [...] "ew Western historians of World War II... know that the British had committed to bomb Germany if it attacked Poland, but did not do so except for one raid on the base of Wilhelmshafen. The French, who committed to attack Germany in the west, had no <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so." [...] The Western Allies also began a naval blockade of Germany, which aimed to damage the country's economy and war effort. Germany responded by ordering U-boat warfare against Allied merchant and warships, which was to later escalate into the Battle of the Atlantic.|$|E

2500|$|In baseball, {{a pitcher}} can commit {{a number of}} illegal motions or actions that {{constitute}} a balk.

[...] Under other rule sets, notably in the United States under the National Federation of High Schools (Fed or Federation) Baseball Rules, a balk results in an immediate dead ball. [...] In the event a balk is enforced, the pitch is generally (but not always) nullified, each runner is awarded one base, and the batter (generally) remains at bat, and with the previous count.

2500|$|Alcibiades, an Athenian {{general who}} had been the main proponent of the {{disastrous}} Sicilian Expedition during the Peloponnesian Wars, where virtually the entire Athenian invading force of more than 50,000 soldiers and non-combatants (e.g., the rowers of the Triremes) was killed or captured and enslaved, was a student and close friend of Socrates, and his messmate during the siege of Potidaea (433–429 BC). Socrates remained Alcibiades' close friend, admirer, and mentor for about five or six years. While a masterful orator, Alcibiades has been described by at least two 20th century psychologists as exhibiting the classic features of psychopathy.
