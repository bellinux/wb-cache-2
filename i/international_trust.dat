5|$|As news spread, {{other banks}} and trust {{companies}} {{were reluctant to}} lend any money. The {{interest rates on loans}} to brokers at the stock exchange soared to 70% and, with brokers unable to get money, stock prices fell to a low not seen since December 1900. The panic quickly spread to two other large trusts, Trust Company of America and Lincoln Trust Company. By Thursday, October 24, a chain of failures littered the street: Twelfth Ward Bank, Empire City Savings Bank, Hamilton Bank of New York, First National Bank of Brooklyn, <b>International</b> <b>Trust</b> Company of New York, Williamsburg Trust Company of Brooklyn, Borough Bank of Brooklyn, Jenkins Trust Company of Brooklyn and the Union Trust Company of Providence.|$|E

25|$|Foreign {{exchange}} and reserves were controlled {{in the mid-1980s}} by the State Administration of Exchange Control under the People's Bank of China, the central bank. Foreign exchange allocations to banks, ministries, and enterprises were all approved by the State Administration of Exchange Control. The Bank of China, the foreign exchange arm of the People's Bank of China, lost its monopoly on all foreign exchange transactions in 1984 when the Agricultural Bank, People's Construction Bank, China Industrial and Commercial Bank, and China <b>International</b> <b>Trust</b> and Investment Corporation (CITIC) were permitted to deal in foreign currency. The Bank of China remained China's principal foreign exchange bank and provided loans for production and commercial transactions related to exports, set up branches overseas, maintained correspondent relations with foreign banks, and did research on international monetary trends. The Bank of China also was active in international financial markets through such activities as loan syndication and issuing of foreign bonds. CITIC, formed in 1979 to facilitate foreign investment in China, also borrowed and lent internationally and issued foreign bonds in addition to encouraging and participating in joint ventures, importing foreign technology and equipment, and making overseas investments. In 1986 CITIC was renamed CITIC Group and shifted its emphasis to power, metallurgical, and raw materials industries, which had trouble attracting investments. In late 1986 the CITIC Group had set up 47 joint ventures, invested in 114 domestic companies, and issued US$550 million in foreign bonds. The China Investment Bank was established in 1981 as a channel for medium- and long-term loans from international financial {{institutions such as the}} World Bank.|$|E

2500|$|Macleod was not {{directly}} involved in the collusion with France and Israel over the Suez Crisis, but although he was unhappy at the turn of events he did not resign. He never publicly opposed Suez, either at the time or later. He was party to the two crucial Cabinet decisions: the first was the decision on 21 March for a policy of hostility to Nasser, who was seen as a threat to British interests in the Middle East, and of building new alliances with Jordan and Iraq; this led to the withdrawal of American and British financial aid for the Aswan High Dam, which in turn triggered Nasser’s nationalisation of the Canal. Macleod was also party to the Cabinet decision on 27 July, the day after nationalisation the Canal, that Nasser’s action should be opposed {{on the grounds that the}} Canal was an <b>international</b> <b>trust</b> [...] and that Britain, if necessary acting alone, should use force as a last resort. Macleod was not a member of the Egypt Committee, and still less was he party to Eden and Lloyd’s secret dealings with the French and the Israelis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{key escrow}} system for international communication between multiple domains with different policies. In intercepting international communications between two domains serious problems on unfairness may arise when one government has not authorized the message interception in legal. We solve this problem by incorporating a mechanism that allows message interception by law enforcement parties subject to the consent of both governments involved in the communication. That mechanism involves {{the establishment of an}} independent <b>International</b> <b>Trusted</b> Third Party (ITTP) that has the ultimate authority to check of the security policies of each country and permit or deny the interception of international messages. We present a scheme with multiple Diffie-Hellman type key distribution protocoland the ITTP copes with only the secret-key corresponding to its own public-key. We can also make the ITTP “multiple”, and we apply recent developed techniques on distributed (threshold) cryptography to our multiple ITTPs. Thus, the establishment and control of an <b>international</b> <b>trusted</b> third party can done with incorporating by each governments. Key Words: Key escrow/recovery system, Diffie-Hellman key distribution...|$|R
