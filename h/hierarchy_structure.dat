We consider merit as a social construction that structures {{the community as a}} whole by allocating prestige to its participants on the basis of what they do. It implies a hierarchy of the different activities (web maintenance, writing code, bug report [...] .) within the project. We present a study based on the merging of two datasets. We analyze the archive of KDE mailing lists using a social network. We also use responses to a questionnaire of KDE participants. Results bring empirical evidences showing that this <b>hierarchy</b> <b>structures</b> the community of KDE by allocating more central position to participants with more prestigious activities.

5000|$|The Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval {{provided}} the following {{description of the}} role of faceted search for a 2006 workshop:The web search world, since its very beginning, has offered two paradigms:*Navigational search uses a <b>hierarchy</b> <b>structure</b> (taxonomy) to enable users to browse the information space by iteratively narrowing the scope of their quest in a predetermined order, as exemplified by Yahoo! Directory, DMOZ, etc.*Direct search allows users to simply write their queries as a bag of words in a text box. This approach has been made enormously popular by Web search engines. Over the last few years, the direct search paradigm has gained dominance and the navigational approach became less and less popular. Recently, a new approach has emerged, combining both paradigms, namely the faceted search approach. Faceted search enables users to navigate a multi-dimensional information space by combining text search with a progressive narrowing of choices in each dimension. It has become the prevailing user interaction mechanism in e-commerce sites and is being extended to deal with semi-structured data, continuous dimensions, and [...] folksonomies.|$|E

40|$|Hierarchies are an {{important}} means to categorize data stored in OLAP systems. OLAP queries follow the drill/slice/dice-paradigm and therefore exhibit navigation patterns that follow the hierarchy of a dimension. In real-world applications, hierarchies are often unbalanced and share levels, resulting in complex <b>hierarchy</b> <b>structures.</b> So far, encoding methods for simple <b>structured</b> <b>hierarchies</b> have been introduced to handle hierarchies efficiently for query processing. In this paper we propose the HINTA algorithm to compute the clustering order for complex hierarchies by linearization. The physical clustering of OLAP data computed by HINTA significantly improves the performance of OLAP queries. HINTA enables clustering of complex hierarchies that can share hierarchy levels in several classifications over one dimension. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{analytic}} hierarchy process (AHP) has {{advantages that}} the whole number of comparisons can be reduced via a <b>hierarchy</b> <b>structure</b> and the consistency of responses verified via a consistency ratio. However, at the same time, the AHP has disadvantages that values {{vary according to the}} form of <b>hierarchy</b> <b>structure</b> {{and it is difficult to}} maintain consistency itself among responses. If the number of comparisons can be reduced, a comparison within a single level is optimal, and if comparison can be made while the priority among entities is maintained, consistency may be automatically maintained. Thus, in this study, we propose a method of assigning weights, which applies <b>hierarchy</b> <b>structure</b> of AHP and pairwise comparison but complements the disadvantages of AHP. This method has advantages that the number of comparisons can be reduced and also consistency is automatically maintained via determination of priorities first on multiple entities and subsequent comparisons between entities with adjoined priorities...|$|E

40|$|User {{hierarchy}} is {{a critical}} issue in the access control policy for information protection systems. The conventional user <b>hierarchy</b> <b>structure</b> utilized over the past decades is discussed. Within this user <b>hierarchy</b> <b>structure,</b> a user is permitted to access all of the files of other users who are below him in the user hierarchy. However, this relationship is not suitable for the following situation; users desire to keep some permissions of files private to themselves and free from access from superior users.

Furthermore, we also provide an effective and dynamic method that can procure the relationships and the inheritable privileges among users in the user privilege hierarchy.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to establish the “start-up business model”. In the beginning, we will collect the factors which will affect the performance of start-up business by literature review and interview the EMBA students in NCHU. The number of factors should be more than what we think. Therefore, we develope three principles to eliminate the number of factors. Three principles are 1. No common mentioned factor in literature 2. The meaning of factor is not concrete and 3. The characteristics of factors in the same and different levels among <b>hierarchy</b> <b>structure</b> are not independent and dependent, respectively. Then, we will develop questionnaire to ask 100 EMBA students in north, middle and south universities in Taiwan. After the samples are collected, Grey relational Analysis(GRA) will be used to determine the key success factors (KSF) for operating a star-up business. After KSF are determined, Interpretive Structural Model(ISM) will be used to decide the sequences of factors in hierarchy format. When the <b>hierarchy</b> <b>structure</b> is determined, we will host a workshop to discuss the meaning of each level in the <b>hierarchy</b> <b>structure.</b> In the end, we will do comparison study to demonstrate how the “start-up business model” set up by this research {{can be applied to the}} real world by tracking the differences between each step in start-up a business in real world and our model. 本研究為了達到建立「系統化創業模式」，會藉由文獻資料以及訪問曾創過業的中興大學EMBA學員，來蒐集影響創業之因素有哪些，經過這兩種方式想必會蒐集到數量眾多會影響創業的因素，因此，本研究將會依照低度共同性、具體程度低、層級設計之準則三個原則，來達到簡化與刪減過多因素的目的，而經過這三個原則所建立之層級圖，我們將會選擇因素總數為 30 至 50 的層級為基準，以該層級中的因素做為問卷問項的基礎，並於北、中、南大學中EMBA的學員進行調查，共計發放份數為 100 份，並應用灰關聯分析法、詮釋結構模式來分析問卷資料，應用灰關聯分析法可以萃取出數量較少的影響創業之關鍵成功因素，而詮釋結構模式則是將這些被萃取出來的影響創業之關鍵成功因素加以排序，形成具有順序性的階層圖，而這也就是本研究所要建立的「系統化創業模式」，而本研究為了強化這套模式的可行性，會透過座談會的舉辦，來了解此模式在實務上的應用與意涵為何，並套用一個實際的案例(例如:王品集團) 對照該個案成功創業的過程，成為日後其他業者在進行創業時，有一個實際運用「系統化創業模式」的案例...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) is an {{extensive}} reference terminology with an attendant amount of complexity. It has been updated continuously and revisions {{have been released}} semi-annually to meet users’ needs and to reflect the results of quality assurance (QA) activities. Two measures based on structural features are proposed to track the effects of both natural terminology growth and QA activities based on aspects {{of the complexity of}} SNOMED CT. These two measures, called the structural density measure and accumulated structural measure, are derived based on two abstraction networks, the area taxonomy and the partial-area taxonomy. The measures derive from attribute relationship distributions and various concept groupings that are associated with the abstraction networks. They are used to track the trends in the complexity of structures as SNOMED CT changes over time. The measures were calculated for consecutive releases of five SNOMED CT hierarchies, including the Specimen hierarchy. The structural density measure shows that natural growth tends to move a <b>hierarchy’s</b> <b>structure</b> toward a more complex state, whereas the accumulated structural measure shows that QA processes tend to move a <b>hierarchy’s</b> <b>structure</b> toward a less complex state. It is also observed that both the structural density and accumulated structural measures are useful tools to track the evolution of an entire SNOMED CT hierarchy and reveal internal concept migration within it...|$|R
