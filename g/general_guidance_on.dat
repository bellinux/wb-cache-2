40|$|Our {{understanding}} of sleep-related breathing disorders {{is still in}} a period of rapid change. Considerable uncertainty exists in several major areas of patient assessment. Although early definitions of sleep apnoea enshrined the concept of rigid guidelines, such an approach is no longer helpful, and may constrain potential advances. The recognition of the basic pathophysiological events in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) has evolved from purely apnoeas, to include hypopnoeas, and now to increased upper airway resistance alone. Our view as to the significant consequences of such respiratory events has also evolved from alterations to the classic sleep architecture, to hypoxic events, and now to micro-arousals and cardio-vascular events. The exact nature of a significant arousal is also far from clear, with the suggestion that perhaps even EEG based approaches to their measurement may not be telling us the whole story. Finally, the frequency of such respiratory events and their consequences, that lead to significant symptoms and long-term damage, is not known either. Thus, given this situation, the best we can achieve is broad guidelines that stress the main important physiological events and their consequences that need to be assessed, and then interpreted in conjunction with the patient's symptoms. This will not necessarily be the same for all patients and this report offers some <b>general</b> <b>guidance,</b> based <b>on</b> the experience of several centres throughout Europe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract; In this study, 41 teachers, advisors and {{directors}} working in primary education took a questionnaire on early English in primary {{education in the}} Netherlands. They were asked about their beliefs on language learning in general, early English, the current situation {{as compared to the}} ideal situation for teaching English, and possible problems and pitfalls they encountered. The results suggest that teachers hold positive beliefs about starting early with English in primary school, and that there is lots of enthusiasm among teachers. The results also show a certain amount of discontinuity when it comes to teaching English. This discontinuity can be found both between different groups within the same schools, between different primary schools, and between primary and secondary school. The reason therefore is twofold: schools lack time and money, and there is a <b>general</b> lack of <b>guidance</b> <b>on</b> English in primary education; guidance from government for schools, and from schools for teachers. ...|$|R
30|$|At {{the same}} time, ERA {{advisory}} staff functioned as employment ‘generalists’. They offered participants <b>general</b> advice and <b>guidance</b> <b>on</b> adapting to work, {{encouraged them to}} consider seeking full-time work, helped them address issues of balancing work and family life, advised them on seeking promotions and finding better jobs, and urged them to enroll in training courses in whatever areas interested them. However, ERA advisers were not expected to have in-depth knowledge of particular occupations or industries or expertise on the career ladders and training requirements for jobs in those areas. Nor were they expected to steer participants assertively towards particular occupations known to offer real advancement opportunities. They were also not positioned to connect participants who had trained in particular occupational areas with relevant employers who were hiring people with the new skills those participants had acquired. These limitations might have undermined {{the benefits of the}} extra participation in training that ERA caused. Perhaps future advancement-focused programmes would be more effective if they included more career advice that is sector-specific and more narrowly focused on opportunities available in the local labour market.|$|R
