2500|$|In 1989, Larible left Germany {{and started}} {{performing}} in England and Mexico. In 1991, {{he joined the}} biggest and most famous circus in the United States - Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. From 1993 to 2005, he was under contract and quickly became the main attraction. The time in the United States was characterized by hard work and achievement. Larible says, [...] "I would not miss a day, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sick, I went on." [...] On the other hand, he developed in those years, other trademarks, inventing new numbers and perfected his performance. Developed jointly with the Ring Master/owner Kenneth Feld Larible Barnum's Kaleidoscape, a new concept for the United States Circus.|$|E
2500|$|Fitzmorris adhered {{strictly}} to timetables. When he chaired meetings, he always started exactly {{on time and}} finished accordingly. One of his chamber of commerce associates recalled that Fitzmorris ran committee meetings [...] "railroad-style. When an agenda was scheduled for 9 a.m., he would look at his railroad watch and start the meeting at 9 a.m. sharp (not 9:01) - <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the only member who had shown up on time. If the meeting was scheduled for one hour, Jimmy Fitz would look at his watch again at 10 a.m. sharp and summarily close the meeting, even if a pontificating member was in mid-sentence! When people came in late, he would give them the kind of look that only railroad men give late passengers sprinting after a moving train." ...|$|E
2500|$|At age 11, Parker {{took up the}} drums, {{just like}} his brother, and later was making [...] "excessively melodic music from {{about the age of}} 12 to 15", which was [...] "really weird and {{repetitive}} and almost genre-less", by recording his drumming and overdubbing guitar and other instruments in lo-fi experiments. Speaking about this Parker said [...] "I've always recorded music. When I was 12, I used to set up two tape machines and multi-track myself. First, I'd record a beat on the drums, then, I'd play that tape into another tape recorder while playing keyboard; then I'd take that tape and play bass guitar along with the drums and keyboard. I'd keep adding instruments. I did {{that for a long time}} until my dad bought me an 8-track, and then I continued recording music by myself, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in other bands at the same time." [...] This hobby turned into an obsession for Parker who was [...] "just doing music all the time, I never did any homework, I'd just spend every night in the garage recording music." [...] Parker got his first eight-track recorder at age 16.|$|E

2500|$|When Hank {{was asked}} if he wasn’t worried that he was being {{exploited}} he replied: [...] “No, and <b>even</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> don’t care, I’m making money.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{to offer}} you a house like Mr. Dwyer's?" [...] he said. A remark which betrayed--although not to her--his {{knowledge}} of certain earthly strains in his goddess.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly I do. It's {{the best}} thing for me--and for you, too. I shouldn't want to be idle, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a millionaire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! If that's all,' {{observed}} Tom, 'it wouldn't much matter, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{to forget}} it, for Loo's {{not likely to}} think of you unless she sees you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "More likely you'd {{give me a}} clip {{over the}} head. But <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> certain of having the money, you couldn't get away, so walk on briskly and don't let me hear you speak again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not taking}} dead Christians," [...] I {{answered}} firmly, [...] "and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't give {{more than a}} shilling for a specimen like that. You can consider him as a Christian, or you can consider him as a cat; but he's not worth more than a shilling in either case." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> such a hard, severe person, {{does that}} make it honourable or right to help the child I trusted to you to carry on this underhand correspondence?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he said, {{beginning}} {{their conversation}} anew, [...] "that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{able to keep}} you {{with me for a}} short time, you will find it exceedingly dull." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} you, it will {{feel good to}} get back to Oak Hall again," [...] he observed. [...] "You can't imagine how much I've missed the boys and the good times, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> laid up in bed with a broken head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] Lionel continued, [...] "we {{must all}} do {{something}} for ourselves; and I am sure my eyes will never be fit for study. To be a clergyman {{is out of the}} question for me, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> good enough; and so is the law--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{in favor}} of making a compromise, the amount offered would be no temptation. I should advise you to refuse ten {{thousand}} dollars, for it will cost the company {{much more than that}} if we can raise sufficient to carry on the suit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must cry, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> almost seventeen, Marilla," [...] she sobbed. [...] "It is so mortifying. And {{it sounds}} {{the death knell}} of our society. We'll simply be laughed out of existence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} get across, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> alone. At any rate, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not going to desert you, now. Let us keep quiet for an hour, then we shall {{be able to move}} on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is too late, Uncle Martin," [...] I {{answered}} with reluctance, for I longed {{to do something}} to comfort him. [...] "As <b>I</b> told you, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> ready there are others to consider now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{where you}} and me is different," [...] she declared. [...] "I wish I was like that, but I ain't. And where would I come in? Now you're wise why I can't go back to Hampton. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> stuck on the burg and cryin' my eyes out for the Bagatelle I couldn't go back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't talk to me, you naughty thing!' said Mrs Kenwigs, 'don't! <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{to trust}} you by {{yourself}} {{and you were}} to escape being run over, I know you'd run in to Laura Chopkins,' who {{was the daughter of}} the ambitious neighbour, 'and tell her what you're going to wear tomorrow, I know you would. You've no proper pride in yourself, and are not to be trusted out of sight for an instant.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, hardly that. You see, Harriet's {{engaged to}} that Johnson fellow out west. 'Tain't {{generally}} known, but I knew it and that's why I picked on her. I thought it probable that she'd be willing enough {{to flirt with}} me for a little diversion, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> old. Harriet's that sort of a girl. And I made up my mind that if that didn't fetch it nothing would and I'd give up for good and all. But it did, didn't it, Anne?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whatever {{they might}} do," [...] he replied, a little wearily, [...] "I must obey orders. My orders are to remain here, but <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> told that <b>I</b> might go, I should find it hard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope not," [...] said Miss Alsen, {{who thought}} it time to quell a gleam of {{peculiar}} tenderness plainly apparent in the mate’s eyes. [...] "I shouldn’t like to <b>be</b> a sailor <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> a man." ...|$|R
6000|$|O pray, pray don't! Those ugly things terrify me! Why should <b>I</b> <b>be</b> [...] {{tortured}} <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> but a {{means to}} an end! Let me die! It was [...] cruel of him to bring this upon me! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why? Oh! because I {{may have}} {{forgotten}} the army, but I have never forgotten that priestess, {{and she has been}} a great hindrance to me through many ages, delaying me upon my journey to the Other Side, to the Shore of Salvation. I, as a humble Lama, was engaged in preparing her apartment when she entered and threw aside her veil; yes, and perceiving a young man, spoke to me, asking many questions, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not glad to look again upon a woman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] I said resignedly. It {{was no use}} {{fighting}} against this false fate. I don't know <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sure myself where {{the truth of the}} matter began. The conviction that it would end disastrously had been driven into me by all the successive shocks my sense of security had received. I began to ascribe an extraordinary potency to agents in themselves powerless. It was as if Schomberg's baseless gossip had the power to bring about the thing itself or the abstract enmity of Falk could put my ship ashore.|$|E
6000|$|I thought I {{should have}} sunk when I had heard him make this solemn and premeditated declaration. I raved like a mad woman, and, {{at the end}} of my discourse, told him that I did not value what could happen to me, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> forced to beg my bread, for I would stand the test of my own character; and as I could get nothing by being an honest woman, so I should not scruple to declare that [...] "the son you have left what you have to is a bastard you had by me several years before we were married." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{is there}} {{anything}} that I can do for you, captain? You know well that you have but to say the word and that, whatever it <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> would do it, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> cut to pieces the minute afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I doubt it, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{to offer}} my next month's salary as a fee. These hills are very remote to the townsfolk, and one dago {{more or less}} of no importance, but I'll see what I can do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{could not}} get on without her <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> well," [...] {{continued}} Margaret; [...] "and dear mamma had such perfect trust in her, {{and we all know}} and love her so well--it would make us put up with a great deal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then there's another thing," [...] he resumed; [...] "can I? Am I able? Why didn't I {{practise}} different handwritings while I was young? How {{a fellow}} regrets those lost opportunities when he grows up! But there's one comfort: it's not morally wrong; I can {{try it on}} with a clear conscience, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> found out, I wouldn't greatly care--morally, I mean. And then, if I succeed, and if Pitman is staunch--there's {{nothing to do but}} find a venal doctor; and that ought to be simple enough in a place like London. By all accounts the town's alive with them. It wouldn't do, of course, to advertise for a corrupt physician; that would be impolitic. No, I suppose a fellow has simply to spot along the streets for a red lamp and herbs in the window, and then you go in and--and--and put it to him plainly; though it seems a delicate step." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What else {{is there}} to do? The hot weather's close. Pretty soon most of the waterholes will be dry. You can't travel then.... I'm on my back here, an' God only knows when I could be packed out. Not for weeks, mebbe. I'll never be any good again, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to get out alive.... You see, shore this sort of case comes round {{sometimes}} in the desert. It's common enough. I've heard of several cases where men had to go an' leave a feller behind. It's reasonable. If you're fightin' the desert you can't afford to be sentimental... Now, as I said, I'm all in. So what's the sense of you waitin' here, when it means the old desert story? By goin' now mebbe you'll get home. If you wait on a chance of takin' me, you'll be too late. Pretty soon this lava 'll be one roastin' hell. Shore now, boys, you'll see this the right way? Jim, old pard?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me like a sort of a congregational suicide, Mr. Clewe," [...] said she. [...] "And it can't even be said that all the members are doin' it of their own accord, for I am not. If Sammy did not go, I would not, but if he does, I do, and there's the end of that; and I suppose it won't be very much longer before there's the end of all of us. I hope you will tell Mrs. Raleigh that I sent my best love to her with my last words; for <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to see her again, {{it would seem to me}} like {{beginning}} all over again, and this would be the end of this part of my life all the same. What I hope and pray for is that none of the party may die of any kind of a disease before the rest all go to their end together; for remains on board an under-water vessel is somethin' which mighty few nerves would be able to stand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Next," [...] said Trot, [...] "we're goin' to {{hunt for}} that umbrel, Cap'n. I don't mean {{to stay in this}} dismal Blue Country long, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the Queen. Let's find the umbrel and go home as soon as we can." ...|$|R
5000|$|Can't Let You Go <b>Even</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> Die (...) <b>is</b> the 6-track debut mini-album by South Korean ballad boy band 2AM. The {{title track}} [...] "Can't Let You Go <b>Even</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> Die" [...] <b>was</b> {{released}} as single.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a very}} stupid view," [...] Julien declared. [...] "Anne cares no {{more for}} me than for any other man. She isn't that sort. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> in a {{position}} to marry any one, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> quite sure that she would refuse me." ...|$|R
