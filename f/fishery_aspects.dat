40|$|Loligo duvaucelii is {{emerging}} {{as one of the}} important components of by-catch of trawl landings at Mangalore. Males mature at 124 mm and females around 108 mm. This species spawns from December to May. An analysis of intra ovarian eggs indicated that females spawn only once. In contrast, males appear to spawn continuously. Females were dominant at length below 150 mm during most of the months of study. There was a sudden and steep decline in their proportion beyond 150 mm indicating post-spawning mortality. The relation between length, ovary weight and fecundity showed good correlation. On an average L. duvaucelii produces about 5, 300 eggs. The gonad index and nidamental gland index were correlated with the maturity of L. duvaucelii. The length-weight relationship between males and females showed significant difference. The largest recorded male L. duvaucelii was 355 mm and female 228 mm, which are highest so far from Indian coasts. A brief account on <b>fishery</b> <b>aspects</b> of squids is also presented.

40|$|ABSTRACT Coastal hammerheads have {{suffered}} from overexploitation and environmental degradation. We interviewed 79 artisanal fishers to verify <b>fishery</b> <b>aspects,</b> temporal changes in catches and biological aspects of the smalleye hammerhead, Sphyrna tudes, in a marine protected area on Abrolhos Bank, Brazil. Data were compared between three generations of fishers: young, middle-aged and old. Fishers' age varied between 17 and 88 years. We verified significant reductions in the weight of individuals caught by younger fishers. The main types of fishing gear used to catch S. tudes were gill nets and longlines. Overfishing through gill nets and trawl fisheries were mentioned {{as the cause of}} S. tudes population collapse in the region. The shark's diet as reported by fishers consisted of fish, crab and shrimp; austral summer was the reproductive season. A strong similarity was verified between fishers' knowledge and biological data. We suggest as plausible strategies to conserve the local population of S. tudes the reduction of net fisheries impact through zoning and establishment of no take areas. These steps can help to initiate the recovery of this depleted species...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{main purpose}} is {{developing}} effective measures for stocking the Zaporizhzhia (Dnipro) reservoir with valuable fish species {{by studying the}} biological and <b>fishery</b> <b>aspects</b> of the formation and exploitation of their commercial stocks. Methods. During the work, we used the generalized results of integrated hydrobiological studies performed in 2015 - 2017. Materials were collected in the Zaporizhzhia (Dnipro) reservoir using standard fishing gears for fish sampling. Collection and processing of phyto-, zooplankton and zoobenthos samples were carried out using conventional hydrobiological methods. Calculation of fish seed amounts was carried out using classical fishery and ichthyological methods. Findings. The status of fish feed supply of the Zaporizhzhia (Dnipro) reservoir and its production potential was determined. Based on the obtained data, we calculated the potential productivity of the reservoir. It {{was found that the}} reservoir had certain feed supply reserves allowing large scale stocking with the juveniles of commercial fish species. The recommended amounts of reservoir stocking in 2017 were calculated as follows: 570 thousand 1 + carp (weight 100 - 130 g); 1560 thousand 1 + silver carp (weight of 100 - 130 g); 400 thousand 1 + bighead carp (weight of 100 - 130 g); 220 thousand 1 + grass carp (weight of 100 - 130 g); 135 thousand 0 + tench (weight of 10 - 20 g); 83 thousand 0 + pike (weight of 100 g); 83 thousand 1 + pikeperch (weight 100 g). Scientific novelty. The presented results of the study of the state of fish feed supply in the reservoir allow stocking with the calculated amounts creating the bases of the rational use of aquatic bioresources with the preservation of the productive potential of commercial fish species exploited by commercial fishery in the Zaporizhzhia (Dnipro) reservoir.

40|$|Comprehensive {{analysis}} of parameter and driver sensitivity {{is key to}} establishing the credibility of models of complex systems. This is especially so for models of natural systems where experimental manipulation of the real-world to provide controlled validation data is not possible. Models of marine ecosystems fall into this category, but despite the interest in these models for evaluating the {{effects of climate change}} and fishing on nutrient fluxes and the abundances of flora and fauna, none have yet been subjected to global sensitivity analysis. Here we present results of both local ‘one-at-a-time’ (OAT), and variance based global sensitivity analyses (GSA) of the fish and <b>fishery</b> <b>aspects</b> of StrathE 2 E, an end-to-end (nutrients to birds and mammals) ecosystem model of the North Sea. The sensitivity of the model was examined with respect to internal biological parameters, and external drivers related to climate and human activity. The OAT Morris method was first used to screen for factors most influential on model outputs. The Sobol GSA method was then used to calculate quantitative sensitivity indices. The results indicated that the fish and shellfish components of the model (demersal and pelagic fish, filter/deposit and scavenge/carnivore feeding benthos) were influenced by different sets of factors. Harvesting rates were directly influential on demersal and pelagic fish biomasses. Suspension/deposit feeding benthos were directly sensitive to changes in temperature, while the temperature acted indirectly on pelagic fish through the connectivity between model components of the food web. Biomass conversion efficiency was the most important factor for scavenge/carnivorous feeding benthos. The results indicate the primacy of fishing as the most important process affecting total fish biomass, together with varying responses to environmental factors which may be relevant in the context of climate change. The non-linear responses and parameter interactions identified by the analysis also highlight the necessity to use global rather than local methods for the sensitivity {{analysis of}} ecosystem models...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1999 A {{research}} {{has been carried out}} the red shrimp, Aristaeomorpha foliacea, resources of the Strait of Sicily (Mediterranean Sea); the study was aimed at assessing the natural history of the local population, at evaluating the specific fishery, and at proposing management interventions. The experiment was based on seasonal trawl surveys and on two selectivity surveys, employing the covered cod-end method. Various methods have been used to estimate the growth parameters (MULTIFAN, MIX, etc.), as well as the mortality coefficients: morphology and reproduction have been studied too. Specific <b>fishery</b> <b>aspects</b> have been addressed, among which yields, diel differences, selectivity, engagement pattern, quali-quantitative composition of the by-catch. The virtual population has been reconstructed, and the subsequent yield-per-recruit analysis has been accomplished on with different methodologies (incomplete beta function, Thompson & Bell, VIT, ANALEN); sensitivity analyses, transitional profiles, variable recruitment and yield scenarios have been performed. The economic yield-per-recruit analysis has been carried out following the same approaches. Fishermen's interviews, exam of logbooks, and other instruments produced an overview of the human factors ruling the fishery. The Y/R estimates suggest a situation of light overfishing; in economic terms, lowering F {{to the level of the}} F 0. 1 strategy will even produce a substantial increase in the present economic Y/R. Gains in the Y/R could not be obtained without changing the age of first capture. A. foliacea in the Sicilian Channel is caught before reaching the maximum reproductive potential; moreover, undersize animals are worthless in economic terms. Raising and enforcing the legal mesh size could control this growth overfishing; in fact, the present legal mesh (20 mm, side) makes no biological or economical sense. The introduction of a 28 mm mesh cod-end would result in the escapement of almost exclusively the juveniles; since these small shrimps are valued sensibly less than large specimens, only a small loss in the immediate economic return should be expected, followed by long-term gains for the shrimp population, the fishermen and the environment...|$|E

40|$|Management of {{conflicts}} between resources uses {{is a major}} focus of research in environmental economics and a major concern for decision makers and affected parties. While economic simulation models and quantitative methods can be used to improve the information available to decision makers regarding efficient resource uses and the distribution of gains and losses, the analysis of natural resource systems and the services they provide raises very complex issues. This is because such analysis must include not only an appropriate economic framework but also must integrate economics with relevant information from related disciplines, such as <b>fisheries,</b> <b>aspects</b> of geology, and perhaps other sciences which provide can information needed to understand better marine sand mining and its many potential consequences. ^ Hence, the analysis of issues like the resource-use conflicts associated with marine sand mining are especially challenging because of the need for relevant data of affected resources and the many sources of uncertainty associated with the consequences of mining. Ocean resources such as marine sand, fisheries, and habitat are complicatedly inter-related in terms of marine biological and physical systems. This means that development of marine sand should be managed by considering these linkages—if mining is to reflect its full social costs. Yet, limited economic analysis of linkages between the economic and non-economic factors affecting marine resource conflicts is available, and furthermore, the affected resources are separately managed and administrated under different management Acts, particularly in Korea, the focus of this study. Thus, economic analysis which links economic methods with relevant biological and physical information can provide decision makers with useful information for developing resource management policies. ^ The main {{purpose of this study is}} to develop economic framework for contributing to efficient management guidelines for marine sand resources, taking into account longstanding, but heretofore unaddressed, concerns about the inter-related marine environmental system. The development of models that specifically consider the marine environmental linkages of resource management is required to assess these interactions. ...|$|R
