500|$|With 54,288 total entries and a {{combined}} prize pool of $159,796,918, the 2007 WSOP {{was the largest}} series of poker tournaments ever. [...] For many, winning {{a share of the}} prize pool was all that mattered, while others sought the glory associated with winning a bracelet. [...] This dichotomy could not have been illustrated better than a deal negotiated at the Senior Championship event. Tony Korfman wanted the money while Ernest Bennett wanted the glory. [...] Rather than leave their fates to chance, the two of them ensured they got what they wanted. In exchange for splitting the prize money, Korfman agreed to let Bennett win the bracelet. [...] After winning $8.25million in the Main Event, Jerry Yang and his wife retired. [...] "My winning today also means a lot to me, because I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> use this money {{to do a lot of}} good for other people out there," [...] Yang said before donating over a million dollars to charity. [...] Upon winning his record eleventh bracelet, Phil Hellmuth said, [...] "the bracelets have always been a really huge deal, to me more than the other guys, because I knew that they represented history." ...|$|E

2500|$|As the Secretary-General {{election}} drew closer, {{there was}} rising {{criticism of the}} South Korean campaign on Ban's behalf. Specifically, his alleged practice of systematically visiting all member states of the Security Council {{in his role as}} the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade to secure votes in his support by signing trade deals with European countries and pledging aid to developing countries were the focus of many news articles. According to The Washington Post, [...] "rivals have privately grumbled that Republic of Korea, which has the world's 11th-largest economy, has wielded its economic might to generate support for his candidacy". Ban reportedly said that these insinuations were [...] "groundless". In an interview on 17 September 2006 he stated: [...] "As front-runner, I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> become a target of this very scrutinizing process", and that he was [...] "a man of integrity".|$|E

2500|$|Brown {{returned}} {{to music and}} toured the United Kingdom {{for the first time}} in late summer 1974 as part of a Jamaican showcase, along with Cynthia Richards, Al Brown, Sharon Forrester, and The Maytals, after which he was invited to stay on for further dates (where he was backed by The Cimarons, staying in the UK for another three months. While in the UK, he recorded for the first time since his hospitalization, working with producer Sydney Crooks, and again backed by the Cimarons. While Brown was in the UK, Gibbs released an album collecting recordings made earlier in Jamaica, released as The Best of Dennis Brown, and Brown's first single to get a proper UK release was issued on the Synda label - [...] "No More Will I Roam". He {{returned to}} Jamaica for Christmas, but six weeks later was back in the UK, now with Holness in tow as his business manager, to negotiate a record deal with Trojan Records, the first Brown album to be released as a result being Just Dennis, although the pair would be left out of pocket after Trojan's collapse and subsequent buyout by Saga Records. On their return to Jamaica, Brown and Holness resumed recording in earnest with tracks for a new album, including [...] "So Long Rastafari", [...] "Boasting", and [...] "Open the Gate". During 1975, Brown also recorded one-off sessions for Sonia Pottinger ("If You leave Me") and Bunny Lee ("So Much Pain", a duet with Johnny Clarke), and the first recordings began to appear on Brown's new DEB Music label. In the wake of the Trojan collapse, Brown and Holness arranged a deal with local independent label owners Castro Brown (who ran Morpheus Records) and Larry Lawrence (Ethnic Fight) to distribute their releases in the UK. Brown saw the UK as the most important market to target and performed for five consecutive nights at the Georgian Club in Croydon to raise funds to start his new DEB Music label with Castro Brown. In early 1976, Castro secured a deal with Radio London disc jockey Charlie Gillett for Morpheus (and hence DEB) output to be issued through the latter's Oval Records, which had a distribution deal with Virgin Records, but after a dispute over Castro's separate supply of these records to London record shops, the deal was scrapped and the early DEB releases suffered from a lack of promotion. Later that year, Brown voiced two tracks at Lee [...] "Scratch" [...] Perry's Black Ark studio, [...] "Take a Trip to Zion" [...] and [...] "Wolf and Leopard", the latter of which was a hit in Jamaica and would prove to be one of Brown's most popular songs, with a lyric criticizing those criminals who [...] "rode the natty dread bandwagon". Brown confirmed in an interview in Black Echoes that he had parted company with Holness, stating: [...] "I was going along with one man's ideas for too long. Niney was trying to find a new beat at all times, which was disconcerting, so I hadn't been working with my true abilities. Now I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> produce myself." ...|$|E
