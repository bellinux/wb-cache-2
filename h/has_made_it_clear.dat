25|$|A further {{element of}} this process was made public on October 12, 2005, when various press {{agencies}} revealed that JAXA, the Japanese space agency, had been officially approached by Russia {{to participate in the}} project. JAXA <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that {{they are more likely to}} join the project if ESA does so first, which was in doubt after ESA members rejected a study for Europe's involvement in the Kliper project in December 2005. The addition of Japan would make Kliper a truly multinational project, potentially combining the rugged reliability of Russian launchers with Japanese computer technology. A greater pan-national consensus would have allowed for a lighter funding burden on each participant as well.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{symbolism}} of the flag began to shift in the early 21st century as there was a warming of relations between the pan-Blue coalition in Taiwan and the Communist Party of China on mainland China. The flag of the Republic of China has begun to symbolize the existence of a past and possibly future unified China, and as such the government of the PRC <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that for Taiwan to change the flag would be a major provocation in favor of Taiwan independence. The ambiguity surrounding the flag was made apparent during the trip of Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan to mainland China in April 2005, during which the flag was very prominently displayed at ceremonies honoring Sun Yat-Sen at which both KMT party officials and government officials from the PRC were in attendance. One place in Mainland China where the White Sun emblem is still prominently displayed in public is the ceiling mosaic within Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing.|$|E
25|$|Chaka Khan {{was raised}} as a Catholic. She {{attributed}} {{her love of}} music to her grandmother, who introduced her to jazz as a child. Khan became a fan of rhythm and blues music as a pre-teen and at eleven formed a girl group, the Crystalettes, which included her sister Taka. In the late 1960s, Khan attended several civil rights rallies with her father's second wife, Connie, {{a strong supporter of}} the movement, and joined the Black Panther Party after befriending fellow member, activist, and Chicago native Fred Hampton in 1967. Though many think that she was given the name Chaka while in the Panthers she <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that her name Chaka Adunne Aduffe Hodarhi Karifi was given to her at age 13 by a Yoruba Baba. In 1969, she left the Panthers and dropped out of high school, having attended Calumet High School and Kenwood High School (now Kenwood Academy). She began to perform in small groups around the Chicago area, first performing with Cash McCall's group Lyfe, which included her then boyfriend Hassan Khan.|$|E

500|$|Thirdly, {{apart from}} issues {{of foreign affairs}} and {{national}} defence, there are other areas that are non-justiciable such as the interpretation of international treaties operating solely on the international plane. This is illustrated by Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, {{in which it was}} held that for the court to assume jurisdiction in such areas would be an [...] "exorbitant arrogation of adjudicative power", as the court could not presume that its ruling would bind other states. Another non-justiciable area is where the legislature <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that a particular question is reserved to the executive to answer, as in Singapore Airlines which noted that section18 of the State Immunity Act requires those claiming sovereign immunity from lawsuits to first obtain certification from the Singapore Government. In such situations, it is not for the court to disregard the executive's judgment.|$|E
500|$|Gillingham {{chairman}} Paul Scally <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that {{he intends}} to relocate the club away from its current stadium, announcing in September 2003 that [...] "there is no future for the club at the Priestfield". [...] In 2004, the club outlined plans for a new stadium at Cuxton but abandoned them soon afterwards due to the cost of improving transport links to the site. [...] At the time Scally stated that he anticipated the club moving within four years, but by 2007 the proposed date had been pushed back to 2010. In March 2017, he again identified Mill Hill, on the east of the A289 Yokosuka Way, as his preferred site for a new stadium, re-iterated that this was necessary for the club to have ambitions of future Premier League football, and that he would be launching a bond scheme to fund {{the early stages of the}} development.|$|E

Despite this, DJ Shadow <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that he views the album in a positive light and denies any pressure that may have come about {{as a result of the}} album's praise: [...] "...people always seem to suggest that there's this pressure, and that Endtroducing..... is some kind of albatross, and I've just honestly never felt that way. I think that I have a healthy enough respect for the lineage of the music and how rare it is that you can connect with an audience. If that will always be 'the record' then so be it, that's cool."

500|$|In an {{interview}} with io9 on 28 July 2009, creator Russell T Davies {{was asked about the}} controversy surrounding Ianto's death and the fan reaction campaign. He replied [...] "There's a campaign, because he was a coffee boy. But {{do you know how many}} packets of coffee they've received so far? Nine. So I think people writing online might sound like thousands of people, but they are nine." [...] However, those involved in the movement believe that this number is much higher due to a post tallying the coffee sent within the community. When asked about the backlash in a separate interview with Michael Ausiello, Russell T Davies said [...] "It's not particularly a backlash. What's actually happening is, well, nothing really to be honest. It's a few people posting online and getting fans upset". He also stated that the character was gone for good, and that his resurrection would devalue the [...] "entire plot." [...] He recommended that fans who wish to stop watching the show should watch Supernatural [...] "because those boys are beautiful", or [...] "look at poetry" [...] if they [...] "can't handle drama". Following these statements, the Save Ianto Jones website encouraged fans to contact BBC Wales rather than Davies, and temporarily presented on its front page the message [...] "Mr Davies <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> in recent interviews that he views his fans with contempt, and as disposable, which saddens us" [...] and asked not to be [...] "abused". At Comic-Con 2009, a fan claimed that Davies [...] "hurt" [...] a lot of internet fans with his decision to kill Ianto, which she called [...] "out of line." [...] Davies replied that he would not change his mind regarding the decision, adding, [...] "I've got to be blunt about this, there have been campaigns to send packets of coffee to BBC Wales in protest. There have been nine packets sent. I'm not taking the mickey, but that's a very small number." [...] Executive producer Julie Gardner stated [...] "We want people to be engaged, discuss and not always agree with us. At the end of the day, I make drama to support each author's vision. It's not a democracy. Whether people like it or not, it's storytelling." [...] Simon Brew of Den of Geek has criticised the Internet campaigns to resurrect the character, citing that the show would [...] "lose far more credibility" [...] if he were brought back. Brew also expressed doubt that the fans stating they would boycott a fourth series will do so. He summarised: [...] "Torchwood now needs to continue to have the courage of its convictions, and for that to happen, the reset switch simply isn't an option." ...|$|E
