50|$|<b>Dimemorfan</b> (INN) (or dimemorphan) (brand names Astomin, Dastosirr, Tusben), or <b>dimemorfan</b> {{phosphate}} (JAN), {{also known}} as 3,17-dimethylmorphinan, is an antitussive (cough suppressant) of the morphinan family that is widely used in Japan and is also marketed in Spain and Italy. It was developed by Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical (now Astellas Pharma) and introduced in Japan in 1975. <b>Dimemorfan</b> is an analogue of dextromethorphan (DXM) and its active metabolite dextrorphan (DXO), and similarly to them, acts as a potent agonist of the σ1 receptor (Ki = 151 nM). However, unlike DXM and DXO, it does not act significantly as an NMDA receptor antagonist, and for this reason, lacks dissociative effects, thereby having reduced side effects and abuse potential in comparison. Similarly to DXM and DXO, <b>dimemorfan</b> has only relatively low affinity for the σ2 receptor (Ki = 4421 nM).|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study, we demonstrated that a dextromethorphan analog, <b>dimemorfan,</b> has neuroprotective effects. Dextromethorphan and <b>dimemorfan</b> are high-affinity ligands at σ 1 receptors. Dextromethorphan has moderate affinities for phencyclidine sites, while <b>dimemorfan</b> has very low affinities for such sites, suggesting that these sites are not {{essential for the}} anticonvulsant actions of <b>dimemorfan.</b> Kainate (KA) administration (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) produced robust convulsions lasting 4 – 6 [*]h in rats. Pre-treatment with <b>dimemorfan</b> (12 or 24 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) reduced seizures in a dose-dependent manner. <b>Dimemorfan</b> pre-treatment also attenuated the KA-induced increases in c-fos/c-jun expression, activator protein (AP) - 1 DNA-binding activity, and loss of cells in the CA 1 and CA 3 fields of the hippocampus. These effects of <b>dimemorfan</b> were {{comparable to those of}} dextromethorphan. The anticonvulsant action of dextromethorphan or <b>dimemorfan</b> was significantly counteracted by a selective σ 1 receptor antagonist BD 1047, suggesting that the anticonvulsant action of dextromethorphan or <b>dimemorfan</b> is, at least in part, related to σ 1 receptor-activated modulation of AP- 1 transcription factors. We asked whether <b>dimemorfan</b> produces the behavioral side effects seen with dextromethorphan or dextrorphan (a phencyclidine-like metabolite of dextromethorphan). Conditioned place preference and circling behaviors were significantly increased in mice treated with phencyclidine, dextrorphan or dextromethorphan, while mice treated with <b>dimemorfan</b> showed no behavioral side effects. Our results suggest that <b>dimemorfan</b> is equipotent to dextromethorphan in preventing KA-induced seizures, while it may lack behavioral effects, such as psychotomimetic reactions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dimemorfan,</b> an {{antitussive}} {{for more}} than 25 years, has previously {{been reported to be}} a relative high-affinity ligand at sigma- 1 (σ 1) receptor with the Ki value of 151 nM. To test whether <b>dimemorfan</b> has anti-amnesic effects similar to a σ 1 receptor agonist, this study examined its effects on scopolamine- and β-amyloid peptide-(25 - 35) -induced amnesia in mice. <b>Dimemorfan</b> (10 – 40 mg kg− 1, i. p.) administered 30 min before the training trial, immediately after the training trial, or 30 min before the retention test significantly improved scopolamine (1 mg kg− 1, i. p.) - or β-amyloid peptide-(25 - 35) (3 nmol mouse− 1, i. c. v.) -induced amnesia in a step-through passive avoidance test. <b>Dimemorfan</b> (5 – 40 mg kg− 1, i. p.) pretreatment also attenuated scopolamine (8 mg kg− 1, i. p.) -induced amnesia in a water-maze test. And, these anti-amnesic effects of <b>dimemorfan,</b> like the putative σ 1 receptor agonist (+) -N-allylnormetazocine ((+) -SKF- 10047), were antagonized by a σ receptor antagonist haloperidol (0. 25 mg kg− 1, i. p.). These results indicated that <b>dimemorfan</b> has anti-amnesic effects and acts like a σ 1 receptor agonist...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: <b>Dimemorfan</b> (a sigma(1) {{receptor}} agonist) showed neuroprotective {{properties in}} animal models of inflammation-mediated neurodegenerative conditions, but {{its effects on}} inflammatory cells and systemic inflammation remain unclear. Experimental approach: The effects of <b>dimemorfan</b> on phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate (PMA) - and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) -induced neutrophils and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -activated microglial cells, as well as LPSinduced endotoxin shock in mice were elucidated. Key results: <b>Dimemorfan</b> decreased PMA- and fMLP-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and CD 11 b expression in neutrophils, through mechanisms independent of s 1 receptors, possibly by blocking ROS production and G-protein-mediated intracellular calcium increase. <b>Dimemorfan</b> also inhibited LPS-induced ROS and nitric oxide (NO) production, {{as well as that}} of monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), by inhibition of NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity and suppression of iNOS up-regulation through interfering with nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) signalling in microglial cells. Treatment in vivo with <b>dimemorfan</b> (1 and 5 mg kg(- 1), i. p., at three successive times after LPS) decreased plasma TNF-alpha, and neutrophil infiltration and oxidative stress in the lung and liver. Conclusions and implications: Our results suggest that <b>dimemorfan</b> acts via s 1 receptor-independent mechanisms to modulate intracellular calcium increase, NOX activity, and NF-kappa B signalling, resulting in inhibition of iNOS expression and NO production, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These effects may contribute its anti-inflammatory action and protective effects against endotoxin shock in mice...|$|E
