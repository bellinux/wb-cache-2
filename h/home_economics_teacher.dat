The Time Problems Inventory by A. Canfield measured the teachers' time management skills in priority setting, planning, delegation and discipline. Reliability and construct validity were measured with factor analysis. The subjects' teaching assignment was determined with a demographic question. The findings of the study indicated the following: 1) Indiana vocational high school <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> teachers' time management skills in the areas of priorities and planning were lower than those of the norm. 2) In the area of delegation, the norm group and the <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers</b> showed no significant difference. 3) Indiana vocational high school <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers</b> tested significantly above the norm group in the time management skills of discipline. 4) The <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers</b> did not differ in management skills by teaching assignment.

What are the beliefs of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers</b> concerning: a. the students who can profit from <b>home</b> <b>economics?</b> b. the image of <b>home</b> <b>economics?</b> c. the status of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> in the secondary curriculum? d. the factors which they believed counselors should consider when counseling students to enroll or not to enroll in <b>home</b> <b>economics?</b> e. the grade or grades in which girls and/or boys should take <b>home</b> <b>economics?</b> 2. How do <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers</b> help counselors understand the <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> program in their schools? Represented in this study were 160 teachers who made up 49 percent of the junior and senior high school <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers</b> in Oregon. A questionnaire sent out to the <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers</b> contained items concerning the school and <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> program, the teachers' background, beliefs about <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> is part of the curriculum, beliefs about who should enroll in <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> classes, beliefs about what a counselor should consider when enrolling a student into <b>home</b> <b>economics,</b> and practices of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers</b> in helping counselors understand the <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> program. Analysis of the data shows that <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers</b> believed that all students can profit from <b>home</b> <b>economics.</b> They also believed that some <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> courses should be taken by all students at some time during their secondary school career. They also felt that <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> classes for girls are valuable in all grades, seven through 12, but that <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> classes for boys are most valuable in the eleventh and twelfth grades.

By completing interviews with four <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers</b> and by observing in class, we have gained data on didactic approaches in teaching dietary concepts. In {{each of the}} observed classes, we asked pupils about their opinion on the finished class. The model contains 109 sixth grade pupils of an elementary school.

40|$|The thesis {{shows the}} {{informal}} involvement {{of parents in}} the teaching of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> and other activities that take place within the context of this subject. <b>Home</b> <b>economics</b> teaches a lot of skills and knowledge that is useful in everyday life, so {{it would be wise to}} include parents. Presented in the theoretical part of the thesis is the legislation on cooperation with schools and parents on the subject of <b>home</b> <b>economics.</b> Emphasized are the informal cooperation of the school and the parents and the benefits that such participation brings to all involved. Outlined are also some barriers that prevent partnerships between the school and parents. With empirical work I explored the informal involvement of parents in teaching <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> and other activities that take place within the context of this subject. The main objective of the study was to determine whether <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers</b> in the classroom or in the context of this subject are using informal forms of cooperation with parents, whether informal forms of cooperation with parents in teaching <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> occur more frequently in the fifth or sixth grade, and whether they are used more frequently by class <b>teachers</b> or <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers.</b> The findings suggest that <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers</b> use informal forms of cooperation with parents only to a small extent.

A total of 943 students, 156 <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers,</b> and 27 experts responded to the questionnaires;Eleven factors emerged from the factor analysis. Students recognized the importance of the factors, but they were not very able to perform the competencies. Comparisons among perceptions of students, teachers, and experts showed that all groups believed five factors were important. They were family health, resource management, parenting, housing, and family living. The factor that the three groups judged of varying degrees of importance was child development;Within the foods and nutrition, textiles and clothing, leisure time activity, and consumer education factors, all groups placed emphasis on the ability to select and plan rather than the ability to prepare, serve, and do.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{purposes}} of this study were to discover what <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers</b> are doing in Oregon in career education and how they can be better prepared to teach <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> occupational preparation courses. Postcards were sent to <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> departments in 194 public high schools and 83 public junior high schools in Oregon. Postcards were returned from 130 high school teachers and 46 junior high school teachers. From these postcards 50 names and addresses were obtained of individuals who had taught or were currently teaching a <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> career course. Questionnaires were sent to these 50 individuals and 38 were returned in time to be used for the study. Of these 38 returned questionnaires 20 were useful. The other 18 did not describe occupational courses which were at least a semester's duration. The questionnaire was divided into five different sections. The respondents described their educational backgrounds in section I. Section II was designed to obtain information concerning the school where the career <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> course had been taught. Section III of the questionnaire containing seven different parts was designed to reveal the beliefs of the respondents concerning career education in <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> in Oregon. The headings of each of the seven parts were as follows: A. Who needs career education? B. What facilities are needed for teaching career education in <b>home</b> <b>economics?</b> C. What schools should teach career education? D. What should be the teachers' preparation for teaching career education in <b>home</b> <b>economics?</b> E. How should career education be taught? F. What should be the secondary <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> curriculum emphasis in the 1970 's ? G. What are some of the feelings of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers</b> about teaching career education in contrast to teaching consumer and homemaking education? The respondents described the occupational course which they had taught in section IV while section V reflected the respondents' own preparation for teaching career education and suggestions for others who would teach the course. Of the 20 teachers included in this study, four had master's degrees and the other 16 had bachelor's degrees. The majority of the respondents had received their last degree from Oregon State University and were teaching occupational <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> courses {{for the first time this}} year although one had been teaching such a course for five years. The specific courses which the 20 respondents were teaching in occupational <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> included nine in food services, including one in FEAST, seven in child services, three in exploration of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> occupations, one in clothing and textiles services and one in "homemaker's assistant. " From this study based on the responses of 20 <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers</b> in Oregon the following conclusions can be made: 1. The respondents believe that "every secondary school should be having units or courses to emphasize the exploration of the world of work. " 2. <b>Home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers</b> need to make detailed observations and analysis of the job before teaching a career related course. Some individuals believe teachers should experience the work itself but this is not always possible. 3. College subject matter courses are helpful in teaching career courses but other preparation is also necessary. 4. <b>Home</b> <b>economics</b> has a definite part to contribute in preparing individuals for the world of work but this should not be its only purpose. <b>Home</b> <b>economics</b> in the 70 's should still emphasize consumer homemaking as well as career orientated courses. 5. It is just as important to orientate individuals towards the general world of work as it is to prepare them for a cluster of occupations. 6. <b>Home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers</b> need more information on career education. Suggestions for obtaining this information included workshops and curriculum guides for the various <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> career areas. 7. <b>Home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>teachers</b> in Oregon need to be educated as to the meaning of career and occupational education...|$|R
