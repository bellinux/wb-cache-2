GameSpot however called the game [...] "mediocre", [...] "forgettable" [...] and [...] "not much fun", though it noted the detailed [...] "unique look" [...] and parallax scrolling. Eurogamer, which gave ToeJam and Earl's re-release a negative review, praised the departure from the predecessor's concept, saying [...] "it <b>gets</b> <b>some</b> kudos at least for not following the 'more of the same' game sequel mentality." [...] The reviewer praised the [...] "forward thinking" [...] environment interaction, but ultimately decided to give the game a middling score, saying [...] "for all its bold ideas, the basic platforming mechanic is pretty shonky".|$|E

[...] Drew Pinsky, an addiction medicine specialist felt that the film's central characters, both of whom were raised by a single parent in the film, [...] "start looking for ways to solve that problem because they were never given the opportunity to grow an emotional landscape from a nurturing, available parent. They were just quickly parentalized and became a caretaker. And the caretaking is all part of the 'going for a broken person' and trying to fix them."

500|$|Meanwhile, Blonsky is {{revealed}} {{to have survived}} the earlier battle at Culver University and has completely healed. He joins Ross' forces for a third attempt to take Banner into custody. They succeed and Banner, along with Betty, are taken away in a helicopter. Blonsky stays behind and orders Sterns to inject him with Banner's blood, as he covets the Hulk's power. Sterns warns {{that the combination of}} the super-soldier formula and Banner's blood may cause him to become an [...] "abomination", but Blonsky insists. The experiment mutates Blonsky into a creature with size and strength surpassing that of the Hulk, but drives him mad. He attacks Sterns, who <b>gets</b> <b>some</b> of Banner's blood in a cut on his forehead, causing him to begin mutating as well. Blonsky then rampages through Harlem. Realizing that the Hulk {{is the only one who}} can stop Blonsky, Banner convinces Ross to release him. He jumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground.

When Leslie grows concerned they are rushing into their marriage, Ron insists it is not her place to say what works for them, and offers the advice: [...] "Leslie I got married twice, both times I was a lot older than those two and both marriages ended in divorce...and a burning effigy.

500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "Possibly the best Simpsons episode, with a {{constant}} stream of gags, inspired animation (in particular the sequence when Homer begins to see and hear Moe everywhere, from Maggie's gurgles to the leaves on the trees), and a superb plot that twists about in every direction but the one you might expect." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote [...] "From Lisa’s slumber party at the opening through the Cheers spoof at Moe’s, this episode’s another real winner. Homer <b>gets</b> <b>some</b> of his all-time best lines, including a great run where he mocks Marge’s attempts to have him accept his fate. We even find a great twist on Bart’s prank phone calls when he asks for “Hugh Jass”. All in all, “Flaming” provides a terrific show." [...] Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode 5/5, calling it [...] "another great chapter in the history of The Simpsons, with tons of laughs throughout." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine called it [...] "a very funny episode" [...] and highlighted the plot's focus on Moe as [...] "an example of the show gradually expanding its supporting townspeople into characters in their own right," [...] as [...] "Moe was just an angry bartender before this episode. After this one, he's the sad man who sometimes tastes success but always lets it slip away because of his inability {{to do the right thing}} until it's too late." [...] VanDerWerff also interpreted the episode as a metaphor for Simon's relationship with fellow The Simpsons developers Groening and James L. Brooks and Simon's belief that he was not receiving enough credit for The Simpsons.|$|E
