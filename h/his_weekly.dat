After being allowed through the diversion, he collides with another car, damaging its wing mirror. At first the driver, Baxter, tries to extort money from him. When Perowne refuses, Baxter {{and his two}} companions become aggressive. Noticing symptoms in Baxter's behaviour, Perowne quickly recognises the onset of Huntington's disease. Though he is punched in the sternum, Perowne manages to escape unharmed by distracting Baxter with discussions of his disease.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1932, {{after nine}} pictures, Tracy {{remained}} virtually {{unknown to the}} public. He considered leaving Fox once his contract was up for renewal, but a rise in <b>his</b> <b>weekly</b> rate to $1,500 convinced him to stay. He continued to appear in unpopular films, with Me and My Gal (1932) setting an all-time low attendance record for the Roxy Theatre in New York City. He was loaned to Warner Bros. for 20,000 Years in Sing Sing (1932), a prison drama co-starring Bette Davis. Tracy was hopeful {{that it would be}} his break-out role, but despite good reviews this failed to materialize.|$|E

5|$|Bostwick {{returned}} to Millwall, {{but failed to}} make any first-team appearances. In late January 2007, {{he was allowed to}} leave the club on a free transfer to sign for Rushden & Diamonds on an 18-month contract. Rushden were managed by Graham Westley, who had previously written about Bostwick's credentials in <b>his</b> <b>weekly</b> column in The Non-League Paper when Westley was out of work. Bostwick made his Rushden debut in the club's 2–1 away win at league leaders Dagenham & Redbridge, and came off the bench in the following match against St Albans City. He was sent-off {{for the first time in}} his career in Rushden's 2–2 draw with Aldershot Town, receiving a red card for two bookable offences. Bostwick played eight matches for Rushden, but fell out of favour at the club in March 2007 after Westley was fired. As a result, Bostwick did not play for Rushden again, and was released by the club at the end of the 2006–07 season.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at Cambridge Vaughan Williams {{continued}} <b>his</b> <b>weekly</b> lessons with Parry, and studied composition with Charles Wood and organ with Alan Gray. He graduated as Bachelor of Music in 1894 and Bachelor of Arts the following year. After leaving the university he returned to complete his training at the RCM. Parry had by then succeeded Sir George Grove {{as director of the}} college, and Vaughan Williams's new professor of composition was Charles Villiers Stanford. Relations between teacher and student were stormy. Stanford, who had been adventurous in his younger days, had grown deeply conservative; he clashed vigorously with his modern-minded pupil. Vaughan Williams had no wish to follow in the traditions of Stanford's idols, Brahms and Wagner, and he stood up to his teacher as few students dared to do. Beneath Stanford's bluster lay a recognition of Vaughan Williams's talent and a desire to help the young man correct his opaque orchestration and extreme predilection for modal music.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{spent the}} 1954–1955 {{academic}} {{year as a}} Fulbright Visiting Fellow at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. At the time, the Cambridge economics faculty was divided into a Keynesian majority (including Joan Robinson and Richard Kahn) and an anti-Keynesian minority (headed by Dennis Robertson). Friedman speculated that {{he was invited to}} the fellowship, because his views were unacceptable to both of the Cambridge factions. Later <b>his</b> <b>weekly</b> columns for Newsweek magazine (1966–84) were well read and increasingly influential among political and business people. From 1968 to 1978, he and Paul Samuelson participated in the Economics Cassette Series, a biweekly subscription series where the economist would discuss the days' issues for about a half-hour at a time.|$|E

5|$|In January 1941, a {{disagreement}} between Settlemier, {{one of his}} reporters, {{and the editor of}} the Alaska Miner resulted in several changes to the News-Miner. Settlemier was replaced as editor by the reporter, David B. Tewkesbury, and the Alaska Miner was discontinued. Its editor, E.F. Jessen, created Jessen's Weekly, a separate newspaper, to compete with the News-Miner. The Weekly lasted until 1968, when it was closed by the Internal Revenue Service. The same year that Jessen founded <b>his</b> <b>weekly</b> newspaper, the United States became involved in the Second World War. Travel to and from Alaska was restricted, and after Japan invaded the Alaska islands of Attu and Kiska, the News-Miner was censored by the U.S. Army. Fairbanks benefited from a military construction boom as the United States built the Northwest Staging Route to ferry Lend-Lease aircraft to the Soviet Union. The boom left the News-Miner short-staffed, but it continued operations throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|Richard died on May 10, 1958; it was {{ten days}} before the child's tenth birthday. Skelton was {{scheduled}} to do <b>his</b> <b>weekly</b> television show on the day his son was buried. Though there were recordings of some older programs available which the network could have run, he asked that guest performers be used instead. Calling themselves The Friends of Red Skelton, his friends in the television, film and music industries organized The Friends Of Red Skelton Variety Show, which they performed to replace The Red Skelton Show for that week; by May 27, 1958, Skelton had returned to his program. The death of Richard profoundly affected the family; by 1961 Richard's model trains had been moved to a storeroom in the Bel Air mansion, but Skelton refused to have them dismantled. In 1962, the Skelton family moved to Palm Springs, and Skelton used the Bel Air home only on the {{two days a week}} when he was in Los Angeles for his television show taping.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York, Häyhänen {{spent the next}} two years establishing his identity. During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen checked the thumbtack and no one had made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had misplaced it, either buying a newspaper with it or using it as a subway token. For the next seven months the hollow nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. The trail of the hollow nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for <b>his</b> <b>weekly</b> deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a microphotograph containing a series of numbers. The newsboy handed the nickel to a New York detective, who in turn forwarded it to the FBI. From 1953 to 1957, though every effort was made to decipher the microphotograph, the FBI was unable to solve the mystery.|$|E

5|$|He was {{appointed}} manager of Rushden & Diamonds in December 2006, {{with the club}} sitting 22nd in the table, two points adrift of safety. Westley's first game in charge of Rushden was a 1–0 victory away at Cambridge United, as he set about ensuring safety. Westley secured the signatures of several players who he had previously managed at Stevenage; signing the likes of Jamie Cook, David Perpetuini, and Dino Maamria. Westley also brought in the likes of Michael Bostwick and Chris Beardsley – younger players who he had previously written about in <b>his</b> <b>weekly</b> column in The Non-League Paper {{when he was out}} of work. Westley's newly assembled team secured five straight wins in the league, including wins away at the top two teams in the league at the time, Oxford United and Dagenham & Redbridge. Despite managing an upturn {{in the form of the}} club, Westley was surprisingly sacked after a 2–2 draw at Aldershot Town in February 2007. He had taken the club from 22nd in the league to 12th in the space of two and a half months, and the club were on a seven-match unbeaten run at the time. In all, he managed Rushden for 13 games; winning seven, drawing three and losing three. The reason behind Westley's sacking is unknown, but he was replaced two days later by Garry Hill.|$|E
5|$|On March31 {{the insurgents}} kept their {{part of the}} {{agreement}} by allowing the supply bill to be passed on second reading and the budget to be hoisted for ninety days. However, when the cabinet introduced its promised bill, the insurgents claimed {{that it was not}} as agreed and refused to support it. Instead, they demanded Aberhart's resignation and announced that they were prepared to take over the government within 24hours. A delegation put this demand to Aberhart in the evening of March31; according to them, he agreed to resign if they allowed the supply bill to pass a third reading. They did so, but Aberhart denied that he had agreed to resign and refused to do so unless he was defeated in a general election. The insurgents, leery of Aberhart's oratorical powers and the reach of <b>his</b> <b>weekly</b> radio show, wanted to avoid an election. Even so, they rejected a motion by Low to raise their pay for the session by $200, seeing it as a crass bribe.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Academy {{exhibition}} brought Fuseli and {{his painting}} enduring fame. The exhibition included Shakespeare-themed works by Fuseli, which won him {{a commission to}} produce eight paintings for publisher John Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery. One version of The Nightmare hung {{in the home of}} Fuseli's close friend and publisher Joseph Johnson, gracing <b>his</b> <b>weekly</b> dinners for London thinkers and writers. The Nightmare was widely plagiarised, and parodies of it were commonly used for political caricature, by George Cruikshank, Thomas Rowlandson, and others. In these satirical scenes, the incubus afflicts subjects such as Napoleon Bonaparte, Louis XVIII, British politician Charles James Fox, and Prime Minister William Pitt. In another example, admiral Lord Nelson is the demon, and his mistress Emma, Lady Hamilton, the sleeper. While some observers have viewed the parodies as mocking Fuseli, {{it is more likely that}} The Nightmare was simply a vehicle for ridicule of the caricatured subject. The Danish painter, Nicolai Abraham Abildgaard, whom Fuseli had met in Rome, produced his own version of The Nightmare (Danish: Mareridt) which develops on the eroticism of Fuseli's work. Abildgaard's painting shows two naked women asleep in the bed; it is the woman in the foreground who is experiencing the nightmare and the incubus — which is crouched on the woman's stomach, facing her parted legs — has its tail nestling between her exposed breasts.|$|E
