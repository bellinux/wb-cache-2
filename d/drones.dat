5|$|At the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored <b>drones,</b> led by Rhodes in {{a heavily}} weaponized {{version of the}} Mark II armor. Stark arrives in the Mark VI armor to warn Rhodes, but Vanko {{remotely}} takes control of both the <b>drones</b> and Rhodes' armor and attacks Iron Man. Hammer is arrested while Romanoff and Stark's bodyguard Happy Hogan go after Vanko at Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff returns control of the Mark II armor to Rhodes. Stark and Rhodes together defeat Vanko and his <b>drones.</b> Vanko seemingly commits suicide by blowing up his suit.|$|E

50|$|<b>Drone</b> is {{also the}} term for {{the part of a}} musical {{instrument}} intended to produce the <b>drone</b> effect's sustained pitch, generally without the ongoing attention of the player. Different melodic Indian instruments (e.g. the sitar, the sarod, the sarangi and the rudra veena) contain a <b>drone.</b> For example, the sitar features three or four resonating <b>drone</b> strings, and Indian notes (sargam) are practiced to a <b>drone.</b> Bagpipes (like the Great Highland Bagpipe and the Zampogna) feature a number of <b>drone</b> pipes, giving the instruments their characteristic sounds. A hurdy-gurdy has one or more <b>drone</b> strings. The fifth string on a five-string banjo is a <b>drone</b> string with a separate tuning peg that places the end of the string five frets down the neck of the instrument; this string is usually tuned to the same note as that which the first string produces when played at the fifth fret, and the <b>drone</b> string is seldom fretted. The bass strings of the Slovenian <b>drone</b> zither also freely resonate as a <b>drone.</b> The Welsh Crwth also features two <b>drone</b> strings.|$|R

5|$|In {{many social}} insect communities, sex is {{determined}} through haplodiploidy. Haploid male <b>drones</b> develop from unfertilized eggs while diploid females develop from fertilized eggs. Queens of a colony may mate {{with one or}} several <b>drones.</b> On average, a queen shares half of her genes with her sons, but only shares a quarter of her genes with the sons of fertile female workers. Therefore, {{it is in the}} queen's best interests to have her own sons raised, and not the sons of workers. Workers can reproduce in many ants, bees, and wasps because male offspring come from unfertilized eggs.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{there was}} more {{controversy}} at MIT over its involvement in SDI (space weaponry) and CBW (chemical and biological warfare) research. More recently, MIT’s research for the military has included work on robots, <b>drones</b> and ‘battle suits’.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drone</b> zithers or <b>droned</b> zithers are {{stringed}} {{instruments of}} the zither family that have few (sometimes only one) melodic strings {{and a greater}} number of <b>drone</b> strings. The oldest known form of <b>drone</b> zither is the Scheitholt.|$|R
30|$|Model {{different}} terrain scenarios {{taking into}} account multiple <b>drone</b> types and their hardware limits This work combines terrain and network data with <b>drone</b> flight constraints for multiple <b>drone</b> types, applied as linear inequalities.

40|$|<b>Drone</b> is {{a vehicle}} with no pilot on board. Invention of <b>drone</b> was great in future {{as it does}} help in many aspects of {{logistics}} such as military use, agriculture and civilian.

Objectives of this research is to determine the trend of <b>drone</b> contribute to different aspect of logistics industry and the implication of <b>drone.</b> The document will be analyze through the content and it will be evaluate using checklist. The finding of this study will show how <b>drone</b> become one of a technology in logistic, what specific area of usage of <b>drone</b> and how useful is <b>drone</b> to help improved in logistic area. In conclusion, the trend of <b>drone</b> in logistics is yet to be discover and the study of <b>drone</b> have many aspects to be considered to be proven functional.

5|$|Under the code-name Operation Option, the Navy {{projected}} {{that up to}} 18 squadrons of assault <b>drones</b> would be formed, with 162 Grumman TBF Avenger control aircraft and 1000 assault <b>drones</b> being ordered. However technical difficulties {{in the development of}} the TDR-1, combined with a continued low priority given to the project, saw the contract modified with the order reduced to only around 300 aircraft. A single TDR-1 was tested by the U.S. Army Air Forces as the XBQ-4, however no production contract resulted from this testing.|$|E
5|$|Another {{addition}} to the fighting force debuting in Halo 2 were <b>Drones,</b> or Yanme'e (from the planet Palamok); the animators found the creatures challenging, as {{they had to be}} animated to walk, run, crawl, or fly on multiple surfaces. Old concept art from Combat Evolved was re-purposed in influencing the Drone's final shape, which took cues from cockroaches, grasshoppers, and wasps.|$|E

The decision was later confirmed as the right course of action after the 2016 U.S. <b>Drone</b> Nationals and 2016 <b>Drone</b> Worlds was executed under budget, leaving ESPN to cancel the <b>Drone</b> Worlds broadcast after a mediocre production from <b>Drone</b> Nationals.|$|R

50|$|Type B-1 <b>Drone</b> is {{the first}} <b>drone</b> indigenously {{developed}} in China, {{it is also the}} first UAV indigenously developed in China.

Being the very first <b>drone</b> developed in China, it was soon superseded by its upgrade, Improved Type B-1. Development of Type B-1 (Type 01) <b>drone</b> was completed in 1962 and it entered service with Chinese military in the same year.|$|R
40|$|A <b>drone</b> {{monitoring}} system that integrates deep-learning-based detection and tracking modules is proposed in this work. The biggest challenge in adopting deep learning methods for <b>drone</b> detection is the {{limited amount of}} training <b>drone</b> images. To address this issue, we develop a model-based <b>drone</b> augmentation technique that automatically generates <b>drone</b> images with a bounding box label on <b>drone's</b> location. To track a small flying <b>drone,</b> we utilize the residual information between consecutive image frames. Finally, we present an integrated detection and tracking system that outperforms the performance of each individual module containing detection or tracking only. The experiments show that, even being trained on synthetic data, the proposed system performs well on real world <b>drone</b> images with complex background. The USC <b>drone</b> detection and tracking dataset with user labeled bounding boxes is available to the public...|$|R

5|$|The {{impact of}} the closure has been questioned, as the United States still {{has the ability to}} conduct drone attacks from nearby bases in Afghanistan, and {{according}} to the Pakistani military, the base was used mainly for refuelling and maintenance of <b>drones,</b> as well as for emergency landings and logistical support, and not for conducting actual drone operations which had in fact ceased in April 2011. Following the incident, Pakistan stated its intention to shoot down any future US <b>drones</b> intruding on its airspace, and the US suspended drone operations to avoid antagonising Pakistan. One report said that American drone attacks in Pakistan dropped by as much as 50% due to the Salala attack, as well as legal cases.|$|E
5|$|Workers in {{colonies of}} the Asian honey bee, Apis florea, are also {{reported}} {{to engage in}} oophagy.
