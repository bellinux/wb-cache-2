With {{the exception of}} the trunnion arms in the transaxle housing, there was no fore-aft 'location' of the rear suspension. The pressed engine/transaxle/suspension mounting member was detachable from the main body structure. 61 percent of the Dauphine's weight was carried by the rear wheels.|$|E

5000|$|The {{configuration}} {{consists of}} a one-piece axle (solid front axle), {{to the ends of}} which the steerable front wheels are mounted.

40|$|Abstract. Fatigue {{design of}} {{automotive}} axle parts is of prior concern {{because of these}} are high safety parts and {{they are expected to}} drive the overall vehicle mass reduction. In this framework, the stamping process is widely used to form axle parts, before assembling them by welding. Consequently, the mechanical and physical characteristics of the blank sheet are modified, having a strong influence on the fatigue behavior. In this paper, we address the consequences of the stamped process on the fatigue design and how they may be effectively taken into account in the automotive industry. Actually, the coupling between the stamping process and the fatigue design is under development at PSA Peugeot Citroën Company since several years. Such an analysis deals with some major topics: thickness variation, plastic hardening and deformation, and residual stress. All of these ingredients result in fatigue criteria evolutions: it is important to stress that the stamping process can have advantageous or disadvantageous consequences on the fatigue design. This is here highlighted on some examples, dealing with front and rear axles. 1. Main axle safety part: Presentation and mechanical properties The studied part is a steel <b>front</b> axle <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> for a commercial vehicle. The material is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic, with elastic-plastic behavior and isotropic hardening. The part geometry is shown in Fig. 1 and material properties are presented in the Table 1. 2. Fatigue design Design is achieved by applying the Dang Van criterion, Eq. (1) [1, 2]. The macro-meso approach uses of the cumulated plastic strain at a mesoscopic scale as the damage variable. maxt (a(t) + aph(t)) ≤ b with a...|$|R
50|$|Mazda {{reworked}} {{a lot of}} {{the engine}} and electronics to produce the most amount of power. A high pressure fuel pump was added. A larger radiator with faster fans helped with cooling. The cold air intake system was upgraded, S-DIAS now has two intake ports, instead of one. The second port would open at 5500RPM to allow more air into the engine. The Oil metering pump was upgraded to provide more oil to the rotors. A less restricted stainless steel exhaust was added with larger 3.5 inch tips. A Tochigi Fuji torque vectoring limited-slip differential was added. The engine ignition system was upgraded to the high output revision-C coils, for increased performance and engine response. A bespoke track-ready suspension with Bilstein dampers and a urethane-foam-injected <b>front</b> suspension <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> was added. Mazda also focused on reducing weight. The front hood, rear doors and boot lid were made from aluminum. A magnesium steering frame, along with a lightweight carbon fiber prop shaft was also added. The manual transmission model came with exclusive lightweight red leather SPIRIT R bucket seats from Recaro, and lightweight, forged 19-inch BBS bronze aluminum alloy wheels. The automatic transmission model included 10-way power leather seats with lumbar support and 2 position memory in black with red stitching, and 18-inch lightweight BBS dark gunmetal alloy wheels wrapped in Bridgestone Potenza summer tires. Some models came with red leather seats with white stitching. A tire upgrade was available, swapping the Bridgestone's for higher performance Falken extreme summer tires. The automatic models could be specified with the manual transmission model's Recaro bucket seats and 19 inch wheels.|$|R

40|$|Trusses {{used for}} roof support in coal mines are {{constructed}} of two grouted bolts installed at opposing forty-five degree angles into {{the roof and}} a <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> that ties the angled bolts together. The load on the <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> is vertical, which is transverse to the longitudinal axis, and therefore the <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> is loaded in the weakest direction. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the vertical load capacity and deflection of three different types of <b>cross</b> <b>members.</b> Single-point load tests, with the load applied {{in the center of}} the specimen and double-point load tests, with a span of 2. 4 m, were conducted. For the single-point load configuration, the yield of the 25 mm solid bar <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> was nominally 98 kN of vertical load, achieved at 42 cm of deflection. For cable <b>cross</b> <b>members,</b> yield was not achieved even after 45 cm of deflection. Peak vertical loads were about 89 kN for 17 mm cables and 67 kN for the 15 mm cables. For the double-point load configurations, the 25 mm solid bar <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> yielded at 150 kN of vertical load and 25 cm of deflection.
