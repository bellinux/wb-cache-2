40|$|Greenhouse gas {{emissions}} from <b>international</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> {{are exempt from}} liabilities under the Kyoto Protocol. Research into quantifying these emissions is ongoing, and influences policy proposals to reduce emissions. This paper presents a cargo-based analysis of fuel consumption and greenhouse {{gas emissions}} from New Zealand's <b>international</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> of goods. Maritime transport moves 99. 5 % (by mass) of New Zealand's internationally traded products. It is estimated that 73 % of visiting vessels' activity can be directly attributed to the movement of goods {{in and out of}} New Zealand. A cargo-based methodology was used to estimate that the <b>international</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> of New Zealand's imports and exports consumed 2. 5 million tonnes (Mt; 2. 6 billion litres) of fuel during the year 2007, which generated 7. 7 Â Mt of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. Double-counting of emissions would occur if a similar method was applied to all New Zealand's trading partners. In contrast, since few large vessels refuel in New Zealand, the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory listed 2007 international maritime transportation emissions as 0. 98 Â Mt of CO 2, calculated from fuel bunkered for international transport. The results, therefore, show a significant difference between activity-based and bunker-fuel methodologies in quantifying New Zealand's emissions. International policy implications are discussed. <b>International</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> Greenhouse gas emissions New Zealand international trade...|$|E
40|$|The <b>international</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> {{sector has}} a {{significant}} abatement potential and some technical improvements that reduce GHG emissions would already be profitable without any policy in place. This paper analyses in-depth the limits and opportunities of policy options currently under consideration {{at the international level}} to stimulate the sector to reduce its GHG emissions. In particular, in order for the maritime transport sector to become more environmentally friendly, the flexible nature of international market-based measures and the European Union Emission Trading Scheme provide a definite window of opportunity without placing unnecessary high burden on the sector. However, the development of a regional policy, such as at European level, for the <b>international</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> sector faces several obstacles: allocation of emissions, carbon leakage, permit allocation, treatment of the great variety in ship type, size and usage, and transaction cost. Global market-based policies could overcome most of these challenges.

40|$|The chapter {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} that indicators for different port characteristics have {{a statistically significant}} and strong impact on <b>international</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> costs. It reports on empirical work on trade among 16 Latin-American countries. The database incorporates 75, 928 observations, which comprise practically all maritime trade transactions in containerizable goods on most intra-Latin-American trade routes for the year 2002. The regressions incorporate the main classical explanatory variables of maritime transport costs, such as unit cargo value, volume per transaction, geographical distance, bilateral trade volume, and trade balances. It further looks at six indicators for different port characteristics as possible additional determinants of international transport costs. It is found that indicators for port efficiency, port infrastructure, private sector participation, and inter-port connectivity have significant impacts on <b>international</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> costs. The estimated elasticity for port efficiency is the highest of all port-related variables; doubling port efficiency {{in a pair of}} ports has the same impact on international transport costs as halving the distance between them would have. ...|$|E

According to the <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> Organization (Second IMO GHG study, 2009), <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> emitted 1046 million tons (all tons are metric) of CO 2 in 2007, representing 3. 3 % of the world's total CO 2 emissions.

The results show that there is a substantial potential for reducing CO 2 emissions in shipping. Emissions can be reduced by 19 % with a negative abatement cost (cost minimization) and by 28 % at a zero abatement cost. Since these emission reductions are based purely on lower speeds, they can in part be performed now. <b>Maritime</b> <b>transport</b> Speed reductions Greenhouse gas emissions...|$|R

The WTO could update these rules dynamically, and could also enforce them. A WTO-based negotiating forum could generate substantive, uniform seaborne cargo rules in two ways.

The WTO also provides international communities with a quasi-judicial procedure — the WTO dispute settlement mechanism (‘dsm’) — which could also be used to protect and promote the global uniformity of seaborne cargo rules. Such an approach could further reduce divergent interpretations of uniform transport rules by providing a centralised system for the implementation of those rules...|$|R

The relationships in the maritime area may be quite complicated {{and the purpose of}} this thesis is to present them in a reader-friendly, comprehensible manner. The original reason that led me into choice of this topic is my personal interest in both international trade and ships. International transport may be considered as subsidiary to the sale or exchange of goods but is of essential relevance for the conclusion of trade. Approximately 90 % of non-bulk cargo is shipped via ocean. The importance of the <b>international</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> is therefore enormous and together with broadening globalization, the legislation in the area of maritime transport gradually increases its effect on the Czech Republic. Moreover, the freight and other costs of shipping considerably influence purchase price of goods.

The shipping documents enable smooth operation of the international transport and the international transport facilitates the international trade as such. At present, almost all goods at the market are being shipped via ocean during their way to the final customer. The entire movement of goods via ocean is being conducted under shipping documents and the significance of the shipping documents is therefore considerable.

40|$|<b>Maritime</b> <b>transport</b> is by {{its very}} nature an {{international}} mode of transport regulated by a large number of international treaties and conventions, most of them negotiated and concluded within the <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> Organization (IMO). Members of the international community, including some EU Member States themselves, were initially reluctant to transfer their sovereignty in this field of transport to the Community. However, two main events gradually changed the attitude of the Member States to the Community's competence to regulate this mode of transport. First, the mid- 1980 s impetus to establish an internal market by 1992 placed all modes of transport at the centre of the project. It was not feasible to establish a geographical market, stretching from the Atlantic to the Eastern European countries and from the North Sea to the Mediterranean, where goods, people, services and capital would be able to circulate freely, and in a competitive manner, without the Community seriously addressing transport issues. Thus, unsurprisingly, a number of important legislative proposals affecting the provisions of <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> services were adopted and implemented during that period.
