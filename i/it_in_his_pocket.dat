25|$|It {{is presumed}} {{that he was}} {{disposing}} of his belongings throughout the town of Sligo and then folding the bag and putting <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b> Authorities were unable to identify what he was throwing away in the public rubbish bins as the man used the blind spots of the surveillance cameras to his advantage. His movements were very meticulous and methodical {{as if he knew}} where to hide his personal belongings that could have identified him.|$|E
25|$|The {{years of}} {{dictatorship}} were gruesome. Apart {{from the students}} that got 7 {{years in prison for}} toasting to freedom which led directly to the foundation of Amnesty International in 1961, in 1968 students would spend the whole night greasing streets and sidewalks with soap so the mounted police {{would have a hard time}} chasing them down to break a demonstration. It is said that a student dared a policeman to get his shoes and feet wet chasing after a cigarette lighter, thrown in the duck pond, while he had the license for <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b> In those days one needed a permit to own a cigarette lighter, as imposed by Salazar to protect the matches industry.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the evening, he was in Đà Lạt {{when his}} plane had no fuel left, and no pumps were open at the time, so he was marooned there for the night. Fearing a Khánh comeback, the AFC met again and {{unanimously}} resolved to make contingency plans to repel any counter-insurrection by Khánh. Westmoreland sent Colonel Wilson, Khánh's former confidant, to go to the military airport at Đà Lạt to convince the Vietnamese general to resign and allow a new military leadership to take the reins. Khánh finally agreed to leave if he was given a dignified send-off, so the other generals arranged a ceremony at Tan Son Nhut, where military bands serenaded him. He theatrically bent down and picked up some loose dirt before putting <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> saying that he was taking his beloved homeland with him. His enemies, the remaining Vietnamese officers and Taylor, all met him at the airport. He then left as Ambassador-at-Large, and was sent on a world tour, starting with a report at the United Nations in New York City.|$|E

500|$|The Invaders {{continued}} {{to shoot at}} the cabin while others managed to set it on fire. Nate Champion signed his journal entry and put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> before running from the back door with a six shooter {{in one hand and}} either a knife and a rifle in the other. As he emerged, the Invaders shot him dead. The killers pinned a note on Champion's bullet-riddled chest that read, [...] "Cattle Thieves Beware." [...] Jack Flagg, who after escaping his pursuers, rode to Buffalo where he reported Champion's dilemma to the townsfolk. Sheriff Angus then raised a posse of 200 men over the next 24 hours and set out for the KC on Sunday night, April 10.|$|E
500|$|Quirrell {{is one of}} Voldemort's followers, and is now partly {{possessed by}} him: Voldemort's face has sprouted {{on the back of}} his own head, hidden by his turban. [...] Voldemort needs Harry's help to get past the final obstacle: the Mirror of Erised. When stood in front of it, the Mirror {{recognises}} Harry's lack of greed for the Stone and surreptitiously deposits <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b> Quirrell promptly tries to seize the Stone, but his flesh burns on contact with Harry, proving lethal for Quirrell. [...] Harry passes out and awakens in the school hospital, where Dumbledore explains to him that he survived because his mother sacrificed her life to protect him, and this left a powerful protective charm on him. It is also revealed that the invisibility cloak was left by his father for Dumbledore to keep and give to Harry. Voldemort left Quirrell to die and is likely to return by some other means. The Stone has now been destroyed. The school year ends at the final feast, during which Gryffindor wins the House Cup. Harry returns to the Dursleys' for the summer holiday but does not tell them that under-age wizards are forbidden to use magic outside of Hogwarts.|$|E
500|$|An {{official}} {{synopsis of}} the film was published in The Moving Picture World states: [...] "Jack Thorne, a young artist, finds his efforts unappreciated, {{and he and his}} wife and little daughter {{are on the verge of}} starvation. The final blow comes when his last painting, on which he had built much hope, was rejected by a rich man, whom an artist chum kindly brought to the impoverished studio. Jack decides that he can struggle no longer. Unseen by his wife, he picks up his revolver, puts <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> and goes out, intending to end everything. But his little daughter has watched him; she follows him and stays his hand. Her prayers and entreaties bring him to a realization of what his rash act would mean to the two helpless ones that would be left behind. Penitent and remorseful, he accompanies his child back to their poor home. There he confesses to his wife that it was only the child's timely interference that saved him from ending it all. The mother drops on her knees beside her child, and clasping her in her arms, raises grateful eyes to Heaven in a prayer of thankfulness. Jack, looking up suddenly, sees the beautiful group of mother and child, with a light as if from Heaven upon them. Realizing that [...] is the inspiration and subject for which he has sought in vain, he calls for them not to move, and at once begins his great painting of them, which brings him fame and wealth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Opposition to Barberi {{was also}} present here where on his {{journeys}} to the Mass centre local youths would throw rocks at him, though two youths {{took to the}} decision to become Catholics when they were greatly edified to see Barberi kiss each rock that hit him and place <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b> During many of these frequent attacks Barberi barely escaped death. Local Protestant ministers often held anti-Catholic lectures and sermons to ward the people away from Barberi and the Catholics. Wilson records how one of these ministers followed Barberi along a street shouting out various arguments against transubstantiation, Barberi was silent, but as the man {{was about to turn}} off, Barberi retorted: [...] "Jesus Christ said over the consecrated elements, [...] "This is my body" [...] you say [...] "No. It is not his body!" [...] Who then am I to believe? I prefer to believe Jesus Christ." ...|$|E
