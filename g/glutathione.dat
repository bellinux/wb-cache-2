5|$|The <b>glutathione</b> system {{includes}} <b>glutathione,</b> <b>glutathione</b> reductase, <b>glutathione</b> peroxidases, and <b>glutathione</b> S-transferases. This {{system is}} found in animals, plants and microorganisms. <b>Glutathione</b> peroxidase is an enzyme containing four selenium-cofactors that catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. There are at least four different <b>glutathione</b> peroxidase isozymes in animals. <b>Glutathione</b> peroxidase 1 is the most abundant and is a very efficient scavenger of hydrogen peroxide, while <b>glutathione</b> peroxidase 4 is most active with lipid hydroperoxides. Surprisingly, <b>glutathione</b> peroxidase 1 is dispensable, as mice lacking this enzyme have normal lifespans, but they are hypersensitive to induced oxidative stress. In addition, the <b>glutathione</b> S-transferases show high activity with lipid peroxides. These enzymes are at particularly high levels in the liver and also serve in detoxification metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Calcitriol, {{the active}} {{metabolite}} of vitamin D3, {{appears to be}} a catalyst for <b>glutathione</b> production. Calcitriol was found to increase <b>glutathione</b> levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing <b>glutathione</b> protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on <b>glutathione</b> levels 96 hours after administration. It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} {{paracetamol}} overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of <b>glutathione</b> become depleted, as {{the demand for}} <b>glutathione</b> is higher than its regeneration. NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with cellular membrane molecules, resulting in widespread hepatocyte damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis. In animal studies, the liver's stores of <b>glutathione</b> must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.|$|E
5|$|Other {{antioxidants}} are not {{obtained from}} the diet, but instead {{are made in the}} body. For example, ubiquinol (coenzyme Q) is poorly absorbed from the gut and is made through the mevalonate pathway. Another example is <b>glutathione,</b> which is made from amino acids. As any <b>glutathione</b> in the gut is broken down to free cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid before being absorbed, even large oral intake has little effect on the concentration of <b>glutathione</b> in the body. Although large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids such as acetylcysteine can increase <b>glutathione,</b> no evidence exists that eating high levels of these <b>glutathione</b> precursors is beneficial for healthy adults.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{damage in}} DNA can cause cancer. Several {{antioxidant}} enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, <b>glutathione</b> peroxidase, <b>glutathione</b> reductase, <b>glutathione</b> S-transferase etc. protect DNA from oxidative stress. It {{has been proposed}} that polymorphisms in these enzymes are associated with DNA damage and subsequently the individual's risk of cancer susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|From {{about three}} billion years ago, prokaryotic selenoprotein {{families}} drive {{the evolution of}} selenocysteine, an amino acid. Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes as selenocysteine, where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage. Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells {{seem to have a}} bacterial phylogenetic origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae, diatoms, sea urchin, fish, and chicken. Selenium enzymes are involved in the small reducing molecules <b>glutathione</b> and thioredoxin. One family of selenium-bearing molecules (the <b>glutathione</b> peroxidases) destroys peroxide and repairs damaged peroxidized cell membranes, using <b>glutathione.</b> Another selenium-bearing enzyme in some plants and in animals (thioredoxin reductase) generates reduced thioredoxin, a dithiol that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme ribonucleotide reductase that makes DNA precursors from RNA precursors.|$|E
5|$|However, not all peptide {{bonds are}} formed in this way. In a few cases, {{peptides}} are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide <b>glutathione</b> {{is an essential}} part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids. In the first step, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase condenses cysteine and glutamic acid through a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by <b>glutathione</b> synthetase to form <b>glutathione.</b>|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol ester prodrug with L-pyroglutamic acid (PCA), a biosynthetic {{precursor}} of <b>glutathione,</b> has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve bioavailability. The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of {{an overdose of}} paracetamol to mice. The liver <b>glutathione</b> values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significative decrease of <b>glutathione</b> of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral LD50 {{was found to be}} greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} in 2003 suggests that extracts from Polyozellus multiplex may have suppressive effects on stomach cancer. The {{study showed that}} feeding a low concentration (0.5% or 1%) of the mushroom extract enhanced {{the activities of the}} enzymes <b>glutathione</b> S-transferase and superoxide dismutase, and increased the abundance of the molecule <b>glutathione.</b> The extract also augmented the expression of the protein p53. All of these substances protect the human organism against cancer. Additional studies reported in 2004 and 2006 attribute anti-tumor properties to polyozellin.|$|E
5|$|A related {{problem for}} aerobic organisms is {{oxidative}} stress. Here, processes including oxidative phosphorylation {{and the formation}} of disulfide bonds during protein folding produce reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. These damaging oxidants are removed by antioxidant metabolites such as <b>glutathione</b> and enzymes such as catalases and peroxidases.|$|E
5|$|Acetylcysteine, {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce {{paracetamol}} toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant <b>glutathione.</b> <b>Glutathione</b> reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite {{so that it}} does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally, acetylcysteine {{has been shown to be}} a more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes with ternary-complex {{mechanisms}} include <b>glutathione</b> S-transferase, {{dihydrofolate reductase}} and DNA polymerase. The following links show short animations of the ternary-complex mechanisms of the enzymes dihydrofolate reductase and DNA polymerase.|$|E
5|$|In {{the regions}} (e.g. various regions within North America) where low {{selenium}} soil levels lead to low {{concentrations in the}} plants, some animal species may be deficient unless selenium is supplemented with diet or injection. Ruminants are particularly susceptible. In general, absorption of dietary selenium is lower in ruminants than other animals, and is lower from forages than from grain. Ruminants grazing certain forages, e.g., some white clover varieties containing cyanogenic glycosides, may have higher selenium requirements, presumably because cyanide is released from the aglycone by glucosidase activity in the rumen and <b>glutathione</b> peroxidases is deactivated by the cyanide acting on the <b>glutathione</b> moiety. Neonate ruminants at risk of white muscle disease may be administered both selenium and vitamin E by injection; some of the WMD myopathies respond only to selenium, some only to vitamin E, and some to either.|$|E
5|$|N-Acetylcysteine {{has shown}} promise in {{combination}} with other therapies. Animal studies indicate the amatoxins deplete hepatic glutathione; N-acetylcysteine serves as a <b>glutathione</b> precursor and may therefore prevent reduced <b>glutathione</b> levels and subsequent liver damage. None of the antidotes used have undergone prospective, randomized clinical trials, and only anecdotal support is available. Silibinin and N-acetylcysteine appear to be the therapies with the most potential benefit. Repeated doses of activated carbon may be helpful by absorbing any toxins returned to the gastrointestinal tract following enterohepatic circulation. Other methods of enhancing the elimination of the toxins have been trialed; techniques such as hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and peritoneal dialysis have occasionally yielded success, but overall do not appear to improve outcome.|$|E
5|$|To {{balance the}} {{oxidative}} state, {{plants and animals}} maintain complex systems of overlapping antioxidants, such as <b>glutathione</b> and enzymes (e.g., catalase and superoxide dismutase) produced internally or the dietary antioxidants: vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E.|$|E
5|$|Fasting {{is a risk}} factor, {{possibly}} because of depletion of liver <b>glutathione</b> reserves. The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inhibitor isoniazid {{increases the risk of}} hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear. Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates, have also been reported as risk factors.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. Risk factors for toxicity include alcoholism, malnutrition, and the taking of certain other medications. Liver damage results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its metabolites, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI decreases the liver's <b>glutathione</b> and directly damages cells in the liver. Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken. These values are often plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine level of concern.|$|E
5|$|Selenium is a {{component}} of the unusual amino acids selenocysteine and selenomethionine. In humans, selenium is a trace element nutrient that functions as cofactor for reduction of antioxidant enzymes, such as <b>glutathione</b> peroxidases and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase found in animals and some plants (this enzyme occurs in all living organisms, but not all forms of it in plants require selenium).|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants are {{classified}} into two broad divisions, {{depending on whether}} they are soluble in water (hydrophilic) or in lipids (lipophilic). In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell cytosol and the blood plasma, while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidation. These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet. The different antioxidants are present at {{a wide range of}} concentrations in body fluids and tissues, with some such as <b>glutathione</b> or ubiquinone mostly present within cells, while others such as uric acid are more evenly distributed (see table below). Some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in pathogens and can be virulence factors.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} α-tocopherol form is the most {{important}} lipid-soluble antioxidant, and that it protects membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction. This removes the free radical intermediates and prevents the propagation reaction from continuing. This reaction produces oxidised α-tocopheroxyl radicals that can be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate, retinol or ubiquinol. This is in line with findings showing that α-tocopherol, but not water-soluble antioxidants, efficiently protects <b>glutathione</b> peroxidase 4 (GPX4)-deficient cells from cell death. GPx4 is the only known enzyme that efficiently reduces lipid-hydroperoxides within biological membranes.|$|E
25|$|The {{biosynthesis}} pathway for <b>glutathione</b> {{is found}} in some bacteria, such as cyanobacteria and proteobacteria, but is missing in many other bacteria. Most eukaryotes, including humans, synthesize <b>glutathione,</b> but some do not, such as Leguminosae, Entamoeba, and Giardia. The only archaea that make <b>glutathione</b> are halobacteria.|$|E
25|$|CMFDA was {{initially}} {{used as a}} cell tracker. Unfortunately, {{it has also been}} mistakenly used as a <b>glutathione</b> probe. Unlike monochlorobimane, whose fluorescence increases upon reacting with <b>glutathione,</b> the fluorescence increase of CMFDA is due to the hydrolysis of the acetate groups inside cells. Although CMFDA may react with <b>glutathione</b> in cells, the fluorescence increase does not reflect the reaction. Therefore, studies using CMFDA as a <b>glutathione</b> probe should be revisited and re-interpreted.|$|E
25|$|In plants, <b>glutathione</b> {{is crucial}} for biotic and abiotic stress management. It is a pivotal {{component}} of the glutathione-ascorbate cycle, a system that reduces poisonous hydrogen peroxide. It is the precursor of phytochelatins, <b>glutathione</b> oligomers that chelate heavy metals such as cadmium. <b>Glutathione</b> is required for efficient defence against plant pathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae and Phytophthora brassicae. Adenylyl-sulfate reductase, an enzyme of the sulfur assimilation pathway, uses <b>glutathione</b> as an electron donor. Other enzymes using <b>glutathione</b> as a substrate are glutaredoxins. These small oxidoreductases are involved in flower development, salicylic acid, and plant defence signalling.|$|E
25|$|Thiol {{groups are}} {{reducing}} agents, existing at a concentration around 5 mM in animal cells. <b>Glutathione</b> reduces disulfide bonds formed within cytoplasmic proteins to cysteines by {{serving as an}} electron donor. In the process, <b>glutathione</b> is converted to its oxidized form, <b>glutathione</b> disulfide (GSSG), also called L-(–)-glutathione.|$|E
25|$|The major {{limitation}} of these bimane based probes {{and many other}} reported probes is that these probes are based on irreversible chemical reactions with <b>glutathione,</b> which renders these probes incapable of monitoring the real-time <b>glutathione</b> dynamics. Recently, the first reversible reaction based fluorescent probe-ThiolQuant Green (TQG)-for <b>glutathione</b> was reported. ThiolQuant Green can not only perform high resolution measurements of <b>glutathione</b> levels in single cells using a confocal microscope, but also be applied in flow cytometry to perform bulk measurements.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glutathione,</b> {{along with}} {{oxidized}} <b>glutathione</b> (GSSG) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), {{have been found}} to bind to the glutamate recognition site of the NMDA and AMPA receptors (via their γ-glutamyl moieties), and may be endogenous neuromodulators. At millimolar concentrations, they may also modulate the redox state of the NMDA receptor complex. <b>Glutathione</b> has been found to bind to and activate ionotropic receptors that are different from any other excitatory amino acid receptor, and which may constitute <b>glutathione</b> receptors, potentially making it a neurotransmitter. <b>Glutathione</b> is also able to activate the purinergic P2X7 receptor from Müller glia, inducing acute calcium transient signals and GABA release from both retinal neurons and glial cells.|$|E
25|$|HxA3 was {{converted}} through a Michael addition catalyzed by <b>glutathione</b> transferase to its <b>glutathione</b> conjugate, HxA3-C, i.e., 11-glutathionyl-HxA3, in a cell-free system or in homogenates of rat brain hippocampus tissue; HxA3-C {{proved to be}} a potent stimulator of membrane hyperpolarization in rat hippocampal CA1 neurons. This formation of hepoxilin A3-C appears analogous to the formation of leukotriene C4 by the conjugation of <b>glutathione</b> to leukotriene A4. <b>Glutathione</b> conjugates of 14,15-HxA3 and 14,15-HxB3 have also been detected the human Hodgkin disease Reed–Sternberg cell line, L1236.|$|E
25|$|Paracetamol is {{the major}} {{metabolite}} of phenacetin and may contribute to kidney injury through a specific mechanism. In cells of the kidney, cyclooxygenases catalyse the conversion of paracetamol into N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI). NAPQI depletes <b>glutathione</b> via non-enzymatic conjugation with <b>glutathione,</b> a naturally occurring antioxidant. With depletion of <b>glutathione,</b> cells of the kidney become particularly sensitive to oxidative damage.|$|E
25|$|S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a cosubstrate {{involved}} in methyl group transfer, {{has also been}} shown to increase cellular <b>glutathione</b> content in persons suffering from a disease-related <b>glutathione</b> deficiency.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glutathione</b> (GSH) {{participates in}} {{leukotriene}} synthesis {{and is a}} cofactor for the enzyme <b>glutathione</b> peroxidase. It is also important as a hydrophilic molecule that is added to lipophilic toxins and waste in the liver during biotransformation before they can {{become part of the}} bile. <b>Glutathione</b> is also needed for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, a toxin produced as a byproduct of metabolism.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glutathione</b> reductase (GR) catalyzes the {{reduction}} of <b>glutathione</b> disulfide (GSSG) to <b>glutathione</b> (GSH). GR requires FAD and NADPH to facilitate this reaction; first a hydride must be transferred from NADPH to FAD. The reduced flavin can then act as a nucleophile to attack the disulfide, this forms the C4a-cysteine adduct. Elimination of this adduct results in a flavin-thiolate charge-transfer complex.|$|E
25|$|Because direct supplementation of <b>glutathione</b> is {{not always}} successful, supply of the raw {{nutritional}} materials used to generate GSH, such as cysteine and glycine, {{may be more effective}} at increasing <b>glutathione</b> levels. Other antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C) may also work synergistically with <b>glutathione,</b> preventing depletion of either. The glutathione-ascorbate cycle, which works to detoxify hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), is one very specific example of this phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Once a tumor {{has been}} established, {{elevated}} levels of <b>glutathione</b> may act to protect cancerous cells by conferring resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. The antineoplastic mustard drug canfosfamide was modelled {{on the structure of}} <b>glutathione.</b>|$|E
25|$|Catalase, {{which is}} {{concentrated}} in peroxisomes located next to mitochondria, reacts with the hydrogen peroxide to catalyze the formation of water and oxygen. <b>Glutathione</b> peroxidase reduces hydrogen peroxide by transferring {{the energy of the}} reactive peroxides to a very small sulfur-containing protein called <b>glutathione.</b> The sulfur contained in these enzymes acts as the reactive center, carrying reactive electrons from the peroxide to the <b>glutathione.</b> Peroxiredoxins also degrade H2O2, within the mitochondria, cytosol, and nucleus.|$|E
25|$|This {{detoxification}} {{reaction is}} {{carried out by the}} glyoxalase system. Glyoxalase I (EC 4.4.1.5) catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal and reduced <b>glutathione</b> to S-D-lactoyl-glutathione. Glyoxalase II (EC 3.1.2.6) catalyzes the hydrolysis of S-D-lactoyl-glutathione to <b>glutathione</b> and D-lactic acid.|$|E
25|$|Systemic {{bioavailability}} of orally consumed <b>glutathione</b> is poor {{because the}} molecule, a tripeptide, is the substrate of proteases (peptidases) of the alimentary canal, {{and due to}} the absence of a specific carrier of <b>glutathione</b> at the level of cell membrane.|$|E
