40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} {{a large scale}} sensor network comprising multiple, say <b>K,</b> <b>base</b> stations {{and a large number}} of wireless sensors. Such an infrastructure is expected to be more energy efficient and scale well with the size of the sensor nodes. To support a large number of queries, we examine the problem of allocating queries across the base stations to minimize the total data communication cost among the sensors. In particular, we examine similarity-aware techniques that exploit the similarities among queries when allocating queries, so that queries that require data from a common set of sensor nodes are allocated to the same base stations. We first approximate the problem of allocating queries to <b>K</b> <b>base</b> stations as a max-K-cut problem, and adapts an existing solution to our context. However, the scheme only works in a static context, where all queries are known in advance. In order to operate in a dynamic environment with frequent query arrivals and termination, we further propose a novel similarity-aware strategy that allocates queries to base stations one at a time. We also propose several heuristics to order a batch of queries for incremental allocation. We conducted experiments to evaluate our proposed schemes, and our results show that our similarity-aware query allocation schemes can effectively exploit the sharing among queries to greatly reduce the communication cost. 1...|$|E

40|$|DNA {{self-assembly}} is {{an emerging}} technology with {{potential as a}} future replacement of conventional lithographic fabrication. A key challenge is the specification of appropriate DNA sequences that are optimal according to specified metrics and satisfy various design rules. To meet this challenge we developed a thermodynamicsbased design automation tool to evaluate the vast DNA sequence space (2. 8 <b>k</b> <b>base</b> pairs) and select appropriate sequences. We use this tool to design DNA nanostructures that were previously impossible with existing text distance based tools. We also show that for nanoscale structures our approach produces superior results compared to existing tools...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: As more {{research}} centers embark on sequencing new genomes, {{the problem of}} DNA fragment assembly for shotgun sequencing is growing in importance and complexity. Accurate and fast assembly is {{a crucial part of}} any sequencing project and since the DNA fragment assembly problem is NPhard, exact solutions are very difficult to obtain. Various heuristics were designed for solving the fragment assembly problem. But, in general, they are unable to sequence very large DNA molecules. In this work, we present several methods, a canonical genetic algorithm, a CHC method, a scatter search algorithm, and a simulated annealing, to solve accurately problem instances that are 77 <b>K</b> <b>base</b> pairs long...|$|E

40|$|Interest {{in solid}} scintillators down to liquid helium {{temperature}} and below has grown recently, fuelled by searches for exotic processes in particle physics. We describe a closed-cycle optical cryostat with a 2. 8 <b>K</b> <b>base</b> temperature and a compact optical geometry for multiple photon counting. The large numerical aperture achieved, {{of the order}} of 0. 79 from the optical center to each of the two windows and amounting to 40 % of the total solid angle, allows a significant gain in the efficiency of photon collection. This and the relatively big sample size that can be used facilitate the study of scintillators under gamma irradiation. These features should be an asset for multiple photon counting techniques at low temperature...|$|E

Furthermore, the dependence of the LSSE on temperature gradients as well as the influence of an external magnetic field direction is investigated. PACS numbers: 85. 75. -d, 72. 25. -b, 72. 20.
