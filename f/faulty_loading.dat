There are many reasons behind the wet pack occurrences after autoclaving like poor quality of wrapping materials, faulty valves of rigid container, <b>faulty</b> <b>loading</b> and packaging technique, poor steam quality, sterilizer malfunction and may be design related problems in CSSD sterile storage area. Cause of wet pack after steam sterilization processes may occur severe problems because of wasted time and effort, increased work load, increased cost, potentially contaminated instruments, infection risk to the patient, poor patient outcomes and delayed or cancellation of procedures. But such wet pack scenario can be avoided by various methods by using good steam (water) quality, performing periodic maintenance of the Autoclaves, avoidance of sterilizer overloading, allowing adequate post sterilization time to cool down the materials to room temperature, using good quality wrapping materials, properly maintain temperature and humidity of sterile storage area etc...|$|E

The method is comprised of a programmed analog or digital computing system for implementing the transfer function of a load thereby providing a predictable load. The digital computing system employs a table stored in a microprocessor in which precomputed values of the load transfer function are stored for values of input signal from the stabilization circuit over the range of interest. This technique may be used not only for isolating faults in the stabilization circuit, but also for analyzing a fault in a <b>faulty</b> <b>load</b> by so varying parameters of the computing system as to simulate operation of the actual load with the fault...|$|R

The usage of a new advanced variable slack bus incorporated converged power flow analysis determines the load angle, real power and feeder operating points for normal and fault in various load buses of the network in presence of some chosen harmonic frequencies in the system. The characteristic operating point shifting of the normal and fault operating points in normal and fault P-d planes, determines the rule sets for identifying the fault buses in the grid system considered. This analysis can also be extended for other fault analysis in both online and offline conditions of the system. ...|$|R
50|$|Whereas {{each element}} in the table can be a {{significant}} source of waste in itself, linkages between elements sometimes create a cascade of waste (the so-called domino effect). For example, a <b>faulty</b> <b>load</b> balancer (waste element: Defects) that increases web server response time may cause a lengthy wait for users of a web application (waste element: Waiting), resulting in excessive demand on the customer support call center (waste element: Excess Motion) and, potentially, subsequent visits by account representatives to key customers’ sites to quell concerns about the service availability (waste element: Transportation). In the meantime, the company’s most likely responses to this problem — for example, introducing additional server capacity and/or redundant load balancing software), and hiring extra customer support agents — may contribute yet more waste elements (Overprovisioning and Excess Inventory).|$|R

Among all the power quality problems, like voltage sag andvoltage swell mentioned are of key importance. This is because of the most widely use of newly invented as well as the outdated sensitive equipments connected to the load.

40|$|DC faults {{may cause}} severe {{disruptions}} in {{continuity of service}} to vital loads in a shipboard integrated power system, hence detection, isolation and protection against dc faults must be incorporated in both medium-voltage dc and low-voltage dc systems.

5000|$|Common {{features}} that may cause crack initiation are inclusions, voids or empty {{holes in the}} material, contamination, and stress concentrations. [...] "Hachures", are the lines on fracture surfaces which show crack direction. The broken crankshaft shown at right failed from a surface defect near the bulb at lower centre, the single brittle crack growing up into the bulk material by small steps, a problem known as fatigue. The crankshaft also shows hachures which point back to {{the origin of the}} fracture. Some modes of crack growth can leave characteristic marks on the surface that identify the mode of crack growth and origin on a macro scale e.g. beachmarks or striations on fatigue cracks. The areas of the product can also be very revealing, especially if there are traces of sub-critical cracks, or cracks which have not grown to completion. They can indicate that the material was <b>faulty</b> when <b>loaded,</b> or alternatively, that the sample was overloaded at the time of failure.A cusp is formed where brittle cracks meet, as shown on the picture of a failed catheter (Cp). The cusp was formed by brittle failure of the catheter on a breast implant in silicone rubber. The origin of the cracks is at the shoulder at the left-hand side. Identifying such features will allow a fracture surface map to be made of the surface being studied. The implant failed because of overload, all the imposed loads being concentrated at the connection between the catheter and the bag holding salt solution. As a result, the patient reported loss of fluid from the implant, and it was extracted surgically and replaced.|$|R
40|$|A long {{prevailing}} view {{of human}} reasoning suggests severe limits on our ability to adhere to simple logical or mathematical prescriptions. A key position assumes these failures arise from insufficient monitoring of rapidly produced intuitions. These faulty intuitions are thought to arise from a proposed substitution process, by which reasoners unknowingly interpret more difficult questions as easier ones. Recent work, however, suggests that reasoners are not blind to this substitution process, but in fact detect that their erroneous responses are not warranted. Using the popular bat-and-ball problem, we investigated whether this substitution sensitivity arises out of an automatic System 1 process or whether {{it depends on the}} operation of an executive resource demanding System 2 process. Results showed that accuracy on the bat-and-ball problem clearly declined under cognitive load. However, both reduced response confidence and increased response latencies indicated that biased reasoners remained sensitive to their <b>faulty</b> responses under <b>load.</b> Results suggest that a crucial substitution monitoring process is not only successfully engaged, but that it automatically operates as an autonomous System 1 process. By signaling its doubt along with a biased intuition, it appears System 1 is “smarter ” than traditionally assumed...|$|R

30|$|Besides {{harmonic}} distortion, {{the voltage}} unbalance {{is one of}} the most common power quality disturbances in industrial systems. The voltage unbalance frequently occurs due to unsymmetrical impedances of transmission and distribution lines, unequal distribution of single-phase loads, unbalanced three-phase <b>loads,</b> <b>faulty</b> delta transformer connections and single-phase-to-ground faults, among others. Most of the electric equipment have damage susceptibility under unbalance voltage conditions. For instance, operation of induction motors at 5 % of voltage unbalance factor (VUF) is not recommended [21, 22]. Additionally, three-phase uncontrolled rectifiers with large output capacitive filters are seriously affected by voltage unbalance. This class of rectifiers produce an unbalance current factor of 100 % with only a 0.3 % of VUF. It has been also previously reported that 0.3 % of VUF in three-phase uncontrolled rectifiers causes non-characteristics harmonics. In this case, third harmonic currents as large as 19.2 % of magnitude may appear. As a consequence, several international standards have a restriction on the unbalance factor, such as the IEC 61000 - 2 - 2 which limits the VUF to be less than 2 % [23]. Important efforts have also been done to propose advanced control strategies for PFCs based on PWM rectifiers which must be able to maintain an adequate system performance despite of input voltage unbalance conditions. In [24], active power oscillation cancelation methods used to enhance the DPC technique, are presented. It was shown that the controller was able to deal with input unbalance voltages. In [25], a new definition of the reactive power is presented for a DPC technique which is aimed to deal with the input voltage unbalance, and does not require the estimation of positive and negative sequences of the grid. In [26], an improved dead-beat based control for a three-phase PWM rectifier under harmonic and unbalance disturbances is presented. In [27], a control scheme for a voltage source converter (VSC) under input voltage disturbances is presented. This scheme is based on a sinusoidal disturbance estimation, and is aimed to model the voltage unbalance as a disturbance, which is estimated and used in a feedback control.|$|R
