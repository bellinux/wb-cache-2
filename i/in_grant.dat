5|$|Lollapalooza, {{an annual}} summer music festival <b>in</b> <b>Grant</b> Park, was exempt from taxation. Emanuel's brother Ari is the co-CEO of William Morris Endeavor, which co-owns the event.

Although the deal was reached before Emanuel took office, tax breaks must be negotiated every year. It was later revealed that the festival received its tax exemption for 2011 {{in the final days}} of the Daley administration.

5|$|In October 2015, the City {{announced}} that its official annual Christmas tree lighting, {{which had been}} held at Daley Center since 1966 (except for 1982), would {{be held at the}} park in order that the official Christmas tree of the city could be closer to ice skating at McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink, the annual Christmas caroling at Cloud Gate and to the new offerings of the nearby Maggie Daley Park. The annual lighting will occur near Michigan Avenue and Washington Street. Some parties opposed the move that separated the annual tree from the Christkindlmarket and the Chicago Picasso.
