25|$|Van der Hart {{was one of}} {{the players}} {{participating}} in the Watersnoodwedstrijd of 12 March 1953. This was a match played in the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris and was played in honour of the victims of the North Sea flood of 1953, which happened several weeks before the match. Van der Hart, who still played as a professional in France these days, together with several others like Bram Appel, Theo Timmermans, Bertus de Harder and Kees Rijvers stated in 2003 that he heard the news over the radio and realised his country was in panic. The KNVB who still {{did not want to be}} connected with the professionals forbid the match in the first place, but due to a personal rejection from Prince Bernhard the match was played. 8,000 Dutch fans travelled to Paris to witness the match and saw their team beating the strong French team 2–1 with goals scored by De Harder and Appel. The match was the breakthrough to introduce professional football in the Netherlands. The players showed the audience in 90 minutes time <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> players could become when they were focussing on the sport professionally. Only 17 months later the first professional match in the country was played.|$|E

[...] It explores in greater detail the games played by Lat and his friends and the lifestyle {{they had in the}} 1960s. [...] However, Yesterday and Today also compares these past events to similar occurrences in the 1980s and '90s, contrasting the two in a humorous light; the opposition of the two time frames is further enhanced by rendering the portrayals of contemporary scenes in watercolour while those of the past remain in black and white. [...] Lat's goal for this book was to [...] "tell his own children <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> it was in the old days." ...|$|E

[...] Many commentators were impressed with the high number of strong, complex, well-developed and non-stereotypical African American characters like Pembleton, Lewis and Giardello. When the show risked facing cancellation due to poor Nielsen ratings, Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, took what was considered an unusual move and wrote a letter to NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield urging the network not to cancel Homicide. Hooks said the show presented many positive portrayals of African Americans, as well as [...] "a compelling and realistic rendering of today's multiracial and multicultural urban society".|$|E

500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Plugged In criticized Perry's {{decision to}} create an uplifting song about such a serious subject matter as divorce: [...] "Framing the song {{in terms of her}} divorce from Brand, though 'Part of Me', puts a much more somber and serious spin on things.

So no matter how bad things were in her relationship, no matter <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> she feels now, no matter how cathartic the pulsing beats (courtesy of hitmeisters Max Martin and Dr. Luke) might feel, the ultimate end here is a very sad one indeed." [...] Priya Elan of NME panned the song: 'This is the part of me, that you're never going to take away from me,' [...] "she sings in that strange angry robot voice of hers. The sentiment, as ever, is punch you in face crystal clear and probably meant something to one of the (probably) 17 writers who wrote the song.

500|$|Boyd has {{previously}} {{written about the}} 20th century through two characters: The New Confessions was a fictional memoir, and Nat Tate a spoof biography. In Any Human Heart, Boyd uses the journal form as a fresh angle to pursue the subject from: [...] "I wanted to invent my own exemplary figure who could seem almost as real as the real ones and whose life followed a similar pattern: boarding school, university, Paris in the 20s, the rise of Fascism, war, post-war neglect, disillusion, increasing decrepitude, and so on—a long, varied and rackety life that covered most of the century." [...] Boyd sets Mountstuart's life within its context, tracing the grand arc of events during the 20th century by depiciting Mountstuart as swept along {{in the flow of}} history - he serves in World War II, sees the cultural revolution in the 1950s and 60s, and takes advantage of modern transport in his extensive travels around the world. Rather than being re-told in hindsight, their importance in context, historical events are seen through the petty lens of every-day living. For example, in an entry from the 1920s, Mountstuart notes [...] "Coffee with Land Fothergill at the Cadena. She was wearing a velvet coat that matched her eyes. We talked a little stiffly about Mussolini and Italy and I was embarrassed to note <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> informed she was than I." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to his work with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, from 1929 Monteux conducted the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (OSP), founded the previous year. The orchestral scene in Paris in the 1920s had been adversely affected by the [...] "deputy" [...] system, whereby any contracted orchestral player was at liberty, if a better engagement became available, to send a deputy to a rehearsal or even to a concert. In most other major cities in Europe and America this practice either had never existed or had been eradicated. [...] Alongside the opera orchestras, four other Paris orchestras were competing for players. In 1928 the arts patron the Princesse de Polignac combined with the fashion designer Coco Chanel to propose a new orchestra, well enough paid to keep its players from taking conflicting engagements. With financial backing assured, they appointed a triumvirate of musicians – Cortot, Ernest Ansermet and Louis Fourestier – to assemble the OSP. The following year Cortot invited Monteux to become the orchestra's artistic director and principal conductor. Ansermet, its initial musical director, was not pleased at being supplanted by a conductor of whom he was reportedly [...] "ragingly jealous", but the composer Darius Milhaud commented on <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> the orchestra played for Monteux [...] "since Ansermet has been sent back to his Swiss pastures".|$|E
