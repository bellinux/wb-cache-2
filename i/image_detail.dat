25|$|Proper {{reproduction}} of colors, especially in professional environments, requires color management {{of all the}} devices involved in the production process, many of them using RGB. Color management results in several transparent conversions between device-independent and device-dependent color spaces (RGB and others, as CMYK for color printing) during a typical production cycle, {{in order to ensure}} color consistency throughout the process. Along with the creative processing, such interventions on digital images can damage the color accuracy and <b>image</b> <b>detail,</b> especially where the gamut is reduced.

The BM 3 D exploits grouping of similar image blocks into 3 D arrays (groups) on which collaborative Þltering (by hard-thresholding) is applied. We propose two approaches of sharpening by alpha-rooting; the Þrst applies alpharooting individually on the 2 D transform spectra of each grouped block; the second applies alpha-rooting on the 3 D-transform spectra of each 3 D array in order to sharpen Þne <b>image</b> <b>details</b> shared by all grouped blocks and further enhance the interblock differences. The conducted experiments with the proposed method show that it can preserve and sharpen Þne <b>image</b> <b>details</b> and effectively attenuate noise. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an efficient detail-preserving random-valued impulse noise filter. The proposed method introduced an image statistic, the decision-based rank ordered absolute differences (DROAD for short), to distinguish <b>image</b> <b>details</b> from impulses. This reduces {{the probability of}} detecting <b>image</b> <b>details</b> as impulses. Besides, in order to search for suitable thresholds at noise detecting phase, we present the Q-estimate of variance in noisy image. According to image variance, we define a threshold for each pixel. This makes more impulses can be identified. Experiments results show that our filter provides a significant improvement over many other existing techniques...|$|R
40|$|To {{effectively}} preserve {{synthetic aperture}} radar (SAR) image edges while filtering, an anisotropic diffusion denoising model based on Euler's elastic energy model is presented. First, a minimum-energy variation model {{is derived from the}} anisotropic diffusion model. To preserve the <b>image</b> <b>details</b> while filtering, the Euler's elastic energy model is introduced. Then an adaptive step-size iteration scheme is proposed to improve the computational efficiency. The new algorithm using both simulated and real SAR images is validated. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only preserves <b>image</b> <b>details</b> effectively while filtering, but also improves the computational efficiency. 在合成孔徑雷達({{synthetic aperture radar}},SAR) 圖像斑點噪聲抑制處理中,為有效保護圖像細節,提出歐拉彈性能量各向異性擴散去噪模型。該模型將各向異性擴散模型轉化為最小能量變分模型,結合歐拉彈性能量模型的邊界保護和增強能力,在抑制噪聲的同時能更有效地保護和增強細節信息。同時為了提高計算效率,提出自適應變步長去噪算法。仿真和真實SAR圖像的實驗結果表明,該算法不僅在抑制噪聲的同時能夠很好地保護圖像細節,而且有效減少了計算時間、提高了效率。link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{proposes a}} RR (Reduced Reference) DIQAM (<b>Detailed</b> <b>Image</b> Quality Assessment Meter) for DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) based compressed images. DCT technique divides image in sub blocks to achieve image compression. Therefore, it degrades the IQ (Image Quality) by introducing the distortions called blockiness and blurriness in the compressed image. In the telecommunication systems scenario, the systems available bandwidth is limited. The proposed IQ assessment technique requires fewer <b>image</b> <b>details</b> parameters called RR parameters at the receiver, {{rather than the}} complete reference image. This paper suggests a method for receiving end to estimate the objective quality of the received image in frequency domain. The proposed IQ meter starts by taking the image through edge detection method, then converting it into frequency domain by Fourier transform and estimating the <b>image</b> <b>details.</b> The <b>image</b> <b>details</b> calculations include the vertical and horizontal ac harmonics {{as well as all}} other ac coefficients present in the image. It has been shown in the presented work that using dc coefficients with the other ac coefficients further improves the quality assessment. The calculated strength of coded <b>image</b> <b>details</b> at receiver is compared with the received RR parameter for the estimation of distortions, blockiness and blurriness. The accuracy of the designed RR DIQAM algorithm is proved by correlating the estimated objective values of the distortions with the LIVE image database 2 subjective DMOS values of blockiness and blurriness. The results obtained by the proposed technique are well matched with the LIVE database values and provide 94 - 96...|$|R
