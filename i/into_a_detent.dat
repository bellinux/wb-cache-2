50|$|A roll-lock knife {{is a type}} of sliding {{knife in}} which the blade rides on a track running the length of the scales, tilting <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> to lock open or closed. Examples would be the Bench Mark Rollox, or its {{licensed}} derivative, the CRKT Rollock. Sliding knives like the Rollox are not considered inertia or gravity knife.|$|E
5000|$|... 1.) Rectilinear stitching. This {{involves}} {{the rotation of}} a digital camera, typically in the portrait (up and down) position and centered directly over the tripod. As the operator manually rotates the camera clockwise, the camera stops or clicks <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> at regular intervals, such as every 30° of rotation. The rotator can be adjusted by changing the position of [...] "detent ring or bolt," [...] into another slot, to alter the interval of rotation: 40°, 60°, 90° etc.|$|E
50|$|Ceramic ball {{integrated}} into integral lock bar - Also introduced as a {{feature in the}} Umnumzaan, the ceramic ball embedded into {{the end of the}} lock bar, creating the interface between the blade locking surface and the integral locking arm surface. The ball doubles to drop <b>into</b> <b>a</b> mating <b>detent</b> on the blade to ensure that the blade does not open accidentally.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanics}} of the Supersport are simple; a spring and piston is compressed by pulling the barrel through 110° before a pellet is loaded directly into the barrel. The barrel is returned to the rest position and locks <b>into</b> place with <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> lock, the rifle is then ready to fire.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>detent</b> mechanism, {{which usually}} also employs its own spring.|$|R
5000|$|Added <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> to the rewind crank {{to allow}} it to stay put when pulled out.|$|R
5000|$|The shutter {{button on}} many cameras has <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> to {{selectively}} activate autofocusing and exposure calculation. Further {{pressure on the}} button then passes the detent and activates the shutter.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical watches {{today are}} mostly sold to buyers who value {{craftsmanship}} and aesthetics over very accurate timing. Most tourbillons use standard Swiss lever escapements, but some have <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> escapement.|$|R
5000|$|On car #2080 (May 1975), {{the parking}} brake micro switch {{was moved to}} a {{different}} position, and was actuated by a plastic collar instead of <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> on the parking brake shaft.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>detent</b> is <b>a</b> device used to {{mechanically}} resist or {{arrest the}} rotation of a wheel, axle, or spindle. Such a device can be anything ranging from a simple metal pin to a machine. The term is also used for the method involved.|$|R
5000|$|A {{well-known}} {{example of}} <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> {{can be seen}} on the popular game show [...] "Wheel Of Fortune", which employs rubber flippers to help disambiguate on which wedge the wheel has stopped after being spun by a contestant. Other common examples include: ...|$|R
5000|$|Certain {{styles of}} blind mate RF {{connectors}} feature <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> or undercut {{to allow for}} the mating connector to snap into, improving retention. These styles are typically used when the mate is a cable connector and might see a significant force that would normally demate the connection.|$|R
5000|$|Dual-gang pots - {{these are}} simply two pots stacked together, either with {{concentric}} shafts, allowing the independent control {{of two different}} parameters, or with a common shaft. The latter type {{can be used for}} blending the signals of two pickups together, and they usually feature <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> in the centre position.|$|R
50|$|The TopShot {{camera is}} {{placed at the}} end of an arm that the user must lift before scanning. The arm is just the right length to allow the camera to aim and focus properly. Since the {{position}} of the camera arm is critical to the success of capturing images, it has <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> in the fully lifted position.|$|R
50|$|Some {{types of}} grips, known as dowel grips, {{incorporate}} a leather-covered dowel rod or pipe {{to create a}} linear bump on the outer face of the grip. This bump, {{in conjunction with the}} bar, forms <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> that serves to leverage the gymnast's grip, thus reducing the hand pressure needed to maintain a hold on the apparatus.|$|R
5000|$|The rife {{shared the}} action of the BSA Scorpion Air Pistol, barrel from a BSA Meteor Air Rifle and moulded plastic grips {{designed}} for right hand shooters. The spring and piston were compressed by breaking the barrel through 125° before loading <b>a</b> pellet directly <b>into</b> the breach. The barrel was then returned into place and secured with <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> lock.|$|R
50|$|Blend potentiometers (essentially two potentiometers ganged on {{the same}} shaft) allow {{blending}} together two pickups in varying degrees. The operation {{is the same as}} in a balance control found in stereo equipment - in the middle position (often marked with <b>a</b> <b>detent)</b> both pickups supply their full output, and turning the pot in either direction gradually attenuates one of the pickups while leaving the other at full output.|$|R
50|$|Lockup is {{accomplished}} by a centerpin {{in the rear of}} the cylinder and <b>a</b> ball <b>detent</b> in the frame.|$|R
5000|$|A {{rotary switch}} {{operates}} with a twisting {{motion of the}} operating handle {{with at least two}} positions. One or more positions of the switch may be momentary (biased with a spring), requiring the operator to hold the switch in the position. Other positions may have <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> to hold the position when released. A rotary switch may have multiple levels or [...] "decks" [...] in order to allow it to control multiple circuits.|$|R
50|$|Handcuffs {{with double}} locks have <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> which when engaged stops the cuff from {{ratcheting}} tighter {{to prevent the}} wearer from tightening them. Tightening could be intentional or by struggling; if tightened, the handcuffs may cause nerve damage or loss of circulation. Also some wearers could tighten the cuffs to attempt an escape by having the officer loosen the cuffs and attempting to escape while the cuffs are loose. Double locks also make picking the locks more difficult.|$|R
50|$|The duplex watch {{escapement}} {{was invented}} by Robert Hooke around 1700, improved by Jean Baptiste Dutertre and Pierre Le Roy, and put in final form by Thomas Tyrer, who patented it in 1782.The early forms had two escape wheels. The duplex escapement was difficult to make but achieved much higher accuracy than the cylinder escapement, and could equal that of the (early) lever escapement and when carefully made was {{almost as good as}} <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> escapement.|$|R
50|$|When cocked, in {{the bottom}} tube, the main spring exerts forward {{pressure}} on the striker, {{which in turn is}} held in place by the trigger sear, the valve spring exerts backwards pressure on the valve pin which closes the valve with the cup seal, thus holding back the air/. In the top tube sits the bolt which is connected by a rod to the striker and the paintball which sits in the chamber held in place by <b>a</b> <b>detent.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Walker {{refined and}} popularized the design, {{eventually}} securing a trademark {{for the name}} [...] "Linerlock" [...] in March 1990. Walker's improvement to the design was to facilitate true one handed opening of the knife. [...] This was accomplished by removing the weak back spring and adding a heat-treated stop pin to align the blade in the open position. [...] Walker added <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> ball to hold the blade in the closed position using the same spring force from the liner.|$|R
2500|$|Trolley poles {{are usually}} raised and lowered {{manually}} by a rope {{from the back}} of the vehicle. The rope feeds <b>into</b> <b>a</b> spring reel mechanism, called a [...] "trolley catcher" [...] or [...] "trolley retriever". The trolley catcher contains <b>a</b> <b>detent,</b> like that in an automotive shoulder safety belt, which [...] "catches" [...] the rope to prevent the trolley pole from flying upward if the pole is dewired. The similar looking retriever (see photo) adds a spring mechanism that yanks the pole downward if it should leave the wire, pulling it away from all overhead wire fittings. Catchers are commonly used on trams operating at lower speeds, as in a city, whilst retrievers are used on suburban and interurban lines to limit damage to the overhead at speed.|$|R
50|$|The BrainTwist {{consists}} of 12 colored triangular elements each with <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> {{to aid in}} aligning the apices of the puzzle after rotating them. There are eight colors in the puzzle: red, orange, yellow, light and dark green, blue, violet and magenta. Each of the 12 basic units has a unique combination {{of two of the}} colors - one per side. In the tetrahedral configuration each apex {{consists of}} 3 such elements. Each face of the tetrahedron is also composed of 3 basic color elements.|$|R
5000|$|The {{spring and}} piston were {{compressed}} by breaking the barrel through 125° before loading <b>a</b> pellet directly <b>into</b> the breach. The barrel is then returned {{into place and}} secured with <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> lock. The single stage trigger is adjustable for pressure. The sights are plastic with the front sight {{being able to be}} switched from a bead to a blade and the rear adjustable sight could switch between a [...] "V" [...] and [...] "square notch". The cylinder had two shallow grooves to accept a telescopic sight.|$|R
50|$|About {{the same}} time in France, Pierre Le Roy invented in 1748 the detent {{escapement}} characteristic of modern chronometers. In 1766, Pierre Le Roy created a revolutionary chronometer that incorporated <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> escapement, the temperature-compensated balance and the isochronous balance spring: Harrison showed the possibility of having a reliable chronometer at sea, but these developments by Le Roy are considered by Rupert Gould to be the foundation of the modern chronometer. The innovations of Le Roy made the chronometer a much more accurate piece than had been anticipated.|$|R
40|$|A {{thermally}} powered {{rotary actuator}} is disclosed {{which is used}} for positioning a shaft in first and second positions which are disposed 180 deg apart. A pair of heat extensible springs {{are attached to the}} shaft and to the frame of the rotary actuator for selectively rotating the shaft from one of its two positions to the other position upon the application of heat to one of the heat extensible springs. The heat extensible springs are preferably constructed from the alloy 55 -Nitinol. In the preferred embodiment, <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> mechanism is provided for locking the rotatable shaft in its two rotary positions...|$|R
5000|$|In 1748, {{he invented}} <b>a</b> pivoted <b>detent</b> type of escapement, or {{detached}} escapement, {{which makes him}} {{the inventor of the}} detent escapement: [...] "The invention of the detached escapement belongs to P. Le Roy".|$|R
5000|$|The rife {{shared the}} trigger, piston {{assembly}} and spring with the BSA AirSporter with {{the spring and}} piston being compressed by breaking the barrel through 125° before loading <b>a</b> pellet directly <b>into</b> the breach. The barrel was then returned into place and secured with <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> lock. The single stage trigger was metal, and adjustable for pressure and travel. The sights were plastic with the front sight {{being able to be}} switched from a bead to a blade and the rear adjustable sight could switch between a [...] "V" [...] and [...] "square notch". The cylinder had two shallow grooves to accept a telescopic sight.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> ball <b>detent</b> is <b>a</b> simple {{mechanical}} arrangement {{used to hold}} {{a moving}} part in a temporarily fixed position relative to another part. Usually the moving parts slide with respect to each other, or one part rotates within the other.|$|R
5000|$|Bi-stability can be {{accomplished}} with <b>a</b> mechanical <b>detent</b> and 2 opposing solenoids or a [...] "magna-latch" [...] magnetic latch with a polarity sensitive coil. Positive opens and negative closes or vice versa. The coil is held in position magnetically when actuated.|$|R

50|$|The AKMP rifle uses subdued Radium-illuminated aiming points {{integrated}} into {{the front and rear}} sight. These sights enable targets to be engaged in low-light conditions, e.g. when the battlefield is illuminated with flares, fires or muzzle flashes or when the target is visible as a shadow against an illuminated background. The sliding notch on the sight arm is then moved to the “S” setting (which corresponds to the “3” setting in the AKM). The sight itself is guided on the sliding scale and has a socket, which contains a tritium gas-filled capsule directly beneath the day-time notch. The tritium front post installs into the front sight base using <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> and spring.|$|R

50|$|The {{throttle}} lever assembly is often designed to incorporate high-pressure (HP) cock switches {{so that the}} pilot has instinctive control of the fuel supply to the engine. Microswitches {{are located in the}} throttle box so that the {{throttle lever}}s actuate the switches to shut the valves when the levers are at their aft end of travel. Pushing the levers forward automatically operates the switches to open the fuel cocks, which remain open during the normal operating range of the levers. Two distinct actions are required to actuate the switches again. The throttle lever must be pulled back to its aft position and a mechanical latch operated, or <b>a</b> <b>detent</b> (hard point) overcome, to allow the lever to travel further and shut off the fuel valve.|$|R
