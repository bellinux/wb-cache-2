40|$|International audienceAn {{overview}} of theoretical 1 /f noise models is given. Analytical expressions showing the device geometry and bias dependencies of 1 /f noise in all conduction regimes are summarised. Novel experimental studies on 1 /f noise in MOS transistors {{are presented with}} special emphasis on p-channel transistors from 90 nm CMOS technology. In addition to the noise in the drain terminal, the gate current noise is investigated because the gate insulator is very thin and significant gate leakage current appears at high <b>gate</b> <b>biases.</b> In the subthreshold regime, the drain current noise agrees with the AN model, whereas in strong inversion the evolutions of the noise level can be described by Hooge's empirical relation.
