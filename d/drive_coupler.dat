40|$|During initial {{operation}} of the first linac module, energy gain {{was found to be}} much lower due to various problems which are now identified and solved. A novel way of damping mechanical vibration was implemented to reduce RF power. Cooling was improved by installing a hemispherical structure on the resonator. The <b>drive</b> <b>coupler</b> was redesigned to eliminate metal coating. Design of the tuner/transition flange assemblies was modified to avoid cold leak. After incorporation of these modifications, a few on-line beam accelerations through Linac were accomplished. In one of the beam acceleration, pulsed (1. 3 ns) Silicon beam of 130 MeV from Pelletron accelerator was further bunched to 250 ps by SC Superbuncher. After acceleration through the linac module and subsequent re-bunching using SC Rebuncher (RB), 158 MeV Silicon beam having pulse width of 400 ps was delivered to conduct experiments...|$|E
40|$|A current {{bottleneck}} for {{quantum computation}} is {{the realization of}} high-fidelity two-qubit quantum operations between two and more quantum bits in arrays of coupled qubits. Gates based on parametrically <b>driven</b> tunable <b>couplers</b> offer a convenient method to entangle multiple qubits by selectively activating different interaction terms in the effective Hamiltonian. Here, we study theoretically and experimentally a superconducting qubit setup with two transmon qubits connected via a capacitively coupled tunable bus. We develop a time-dependent Schrieffer-Wolff transformation and derive analytic expressions for exchange-interaction gates swapping excitations between the qubits (iSWAP) and for two-photon gates creating and annihilating simultaneous two-qubit excitations (bSWAP). We find that the bSWAP gate is generally slower than the more commonly used iSWAP gate, but features favorable scalability properties with less severe frequency crowding effects, which typically degrade the fidelity in multi-qubit setups. Our theoretical results are backed by experimental measurements as well as exact numerical simulations including the effects of higher transmon levels and dissipation.

40|$|We {{propose a}} scheme for {{implementing}} cross Kerr nonlinearity between two superconducting transmission line resonators (TLR) via their interaction with a coupler which is constructed by two superconducting charge qubits connected {{to each other}} via a superconducting quantum interference device. When suitably <b>driven,</b> the <b>coupler</b> can induce very strong cross phase modulation (XPM) between the two TLRs due to its N-type level structure and the consequent electromagnetically induced transparency in its lowest states. The flexibility of our design can lead to various inter-TLR coupling configurations. The obtained cross Kerr coefficient {{is large enough to}} allow many important quantum operations in which only few photons are involved. We further show that this scheme is very robust against the fluctuations in solid state circuits. Our numerical calculations imply that the absorption and dispersion resulted from the decoherence of the coupler are very small compared with the strength of the proposed XPM. Comment: Submitted.

40|$|The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is an accelerator-based {{neutron source}} being built at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. A {{conventional}} 402. 5 -MHz drift-tube linac (DTL) accelerates the H − beam from 2. 5 to 86 MeV, {{followed by a}} 805 -MHz coupled-cavity linac (CCL) to 186 MeV. Tuning the six DTL tanks involves adjusting post-coupler lengths and slug tuners to achieve the design resonant frequency and stabilized field distribution. A 2. 5 -MW klystron feeds RF power into a DTL through a ridge-loaded waveguide. The CCL consists of 4 RF modules operating in the π/ 2 mode. Each module contains 96 accelerating cavities in 12 segments of 8 cavities each, 11 active bridge coupler cavities, and 106 nominally unexcited coupling cavities. For each RF module, power from a 5 -MW klystron splits and <b>drives</b> bridge <b>couplers</b> 3 and 9. We will discuss the procedures and special tools developed for the structure tuning...|$|R
40|$|The RF {{system of}} Superconducting {{cyclotron}} has been operational within 9 - 27 MHz frequency. It has three tunable half-wave coaxial cavities as main resonators and three tunable RF amplifier cavities. A PC-based system {{takes care of}} stepper motor driven coarse tuning of cavities with positional accuracy ~ 20 μm and hydraulically <b>driven</b> three <b>couplers</b> and three trimmers. The couplers, in open loop, match the cavity impedance to 50 Ohm in order to feed power from RF amplifier. Trimmers operate in closed loop for fine tuning the cavity, if detuned thermally at high RF power. The control logic has been simulated and finally implemented with Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Precision control of trimmer (~ 20 μm) is essential to achieve the accelerating (Dee) voltage stability better than 100 ppm. and also minimizing the RF power to maintain it. Phase difference between Dee-in and Dee-pick-off signals and the reflected power signals (from cavity) together act in closed loop for fine tuning of the cavity. The closed loop PID control determines the final positioning of the trimmer in each power level and achieved the required voltage stability. IMP;Chinese Academy of Science...|$|R
40|$|Future {{high power}} accelerators are aiming at {{increasing}} the power {{transferred to the}} beam through radiofrequency (RF) cavities. Consequently, multiple main <b>coupler</b> <b>drives</b> {{may be required to}} withstand the high RF power needed per cavity. An analysis including multiple couplers and beam loading is described here, featuring the interaction between all couplers, the beam and the cavity. In this description, the beam is shown to act as if it were merely an additional drive for the cavity. Special focus is given to the case of superconducting cavities in a continuous (CW) operation mode. Some important conclusions derived from this analysis are briefly discussed as, for example, power coupler fault conditions or a way to handle the commissioning of an accelerator in a CW mode. ...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{impressive}} {{progress has}} been made in the development of fiber acoustooptic frequency shifters using acoustically <b>driven,</b> four-port null <b>couplers.</b> Losses as low as 0. 1 dB and frequency conversion efficiencies higher than as 99 % with carrier suppression of > 30 dB have been obtained for acoustic drive powers as low as 2 mW at frequency shifts as high as 10 MHz. Moreover, the devices also act as tunable optical bandpass filters, can be designed to be polarising, and do not give rise to internal back reflections. As such they are ideal modelocking elements for sliding frequency fibre soliton lasers in which frequency shifting, filtering, and polarising components are required. Fibre frequency shifters perform all of these function simultaneously and permit the construction of extremely simple all-fibre, wavelength tunable, low-loss laser cavities. In all schemes demonstrated to date these functions have been performed by discrete/lossy bulk componentry...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{aim of the}} PRISM {{coupling}} and I/O system, {{developed in}} the framework of the EU funded PRISM project, is to provide a portable, efficient and easy-to-use open source software package, which includes a concise appli-cation programmer interface (API) to manage the coupling of arbitrary climate component models as well as the I/O of each individual component. In this arti-cle we will focus on the way the PRISM <b>coupler</b> <b>drives</b> the whole coupled model, ensuring the synchronization of the different component models, the exchange of the coupling fields directly between the components or via additional transforma-tion processes, and I/O actions from/to files. 1 General view of the system A new coupler for Earth System Models (ESMs) is currently under development {{in the framework of}} the Program for Integrated Earth System Modelling (PRISM).

40|$|Introduction We have {{developed}} a low-cost stopcock valve actuator for radiochemistry automation built using a stepper motor and an Arduino, an open-source single-board microcontroller. The con-troller hardware can be programmed to run by serial communication or via two 5 – 24 V digital lines for simple integration into any automation control system. This valve actuator allows for automated use of a single, disposable stopcock, providing a number of advantages over stopcock manifold systems available on many commercial radiochemistry rigs or over using solenoid valves. This actuator allows for the use {{a wide variety of}} stopcocks, ranging in size, shape and material, giving flexibility to be used in a large variety of applications. Material and Methods The actuated valve consists of two main parts, the actuator and the control electronics. The actuator consists of a stepper motor, an infrared ‘home position’ sensor, a stopcock backplate, and a coupler from the driveshaft to stopcock handle. The stepper motor is a NEMA- 17 size that runs 200 steps/rotation with a 5 mm <b>drive</b> shaft. The <b>coupler</b> is an interchangeable part, custom to each stopcock model, with each part drilled out to fit the motor drive shaft and milled out for a tight fit to the stopcock handle. The backplane consists of a plate offset from the motor body with 5 screws positioned to keep the stopcock body from rotating relative to the motor. A reflective optical sensor (Vishay TCRT 1000) is used as a limit switch to determine a ‘home’ position for the stopcock. With a slight modification to most any stopcock in cutting off a tab that limits rotation, the handle can rotate 360 °. This allows for opening all three ports to each other, which has been done to all stopcocks used with this actuator. The control electronics consist of an Arduino Uno board and a motor shield (add-on board), connecting to the actuator by an Ethernet cable. The motor shield functions to interface the low-power Arduino circuitry with a high power H-bridge motor driver circuit. The Arduino runs two sets of code, initialization and its loop. The initialization routine runs when power is first powered up, and then continues to run the loop. The initialization routine rotates the valve until the IR limit switch is activated, and rotates an-other 45 ° from position home, sealing off all ports on the stopcock. Following initialization, the Arduino enters its loop, which repeatedly compares its current position to its target posi-tion. When the target position and current posi-tion do not match, the stepper motor turns in the shortest direction towards its target position. The hardware can be interfaced by either serial communication or by two 5 – 24 V digital signals defining positions 1 – 4. The wide range of allowed input signal voltages is realized by using an optocoupler that accepts 5 – 24 V inputs but outputs TTL signals compatible with the Arduino’s hardware. Results and Conclusion A photo of the implementation of the actuator is shown in FIGURE 1. It has overall dimensions of 3. 5 × 1. 75 × 2. 5 ”, excluding a mounting bracket. Control electronics are housed in a compact box built for an Arduino, giving the control electron-ics a clean, professional look. Challenges in de-sign included determining a maximum motor speed where the motor would provide enough torque but yet move fast enough to be useful, finding that rotational speed of 6 seconds/full rotation is best...|$|R
