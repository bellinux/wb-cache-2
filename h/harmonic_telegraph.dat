50|$|The {{electric}} telephone {{was invented}} in the 1870s, {{it was based on}} earlier work with <b>harmonic</b> (multi-signal) <b>telegraphs.</b> The first commercial telephone services were set up in 1878 and 1879 {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic in the cities of New Haven and London. Alexander Graham Bell held the master patent for the telephone that was needed for such services in both countries. All other patents for electric telephone devices and features flowed from this master patent. Credit for the invention of the electric telephone has been frequently disputed, and new controversies over the issue have arisen from time-to-time. As with other great inventions such as radio, television, the light bulb, and the digital computer, there were several inventors who did pioneering experimental work on voice transmission over a wire, who then improved on each other's ideas. However, the key innovators were Alexander Graham Bell and Gardiner Greene Hubbard, who created the first telephone company, the Bell Telephone Company in the United States, which later evolved into American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), at times the world's largest phone company.|$|R
500|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, it was acoustic resonance {{that inspired}} filtering applications, {{the first of}} these being a telegraph system known as the [...] "harmonic telegraph". Versions are due to Elisha Gray, Alexander Graham Bell (1870s), [...] and others. Its purpose was to simultaneously transmit a number of telegraph messages over the same line and represents an early form of frequency division multiplexing (FDM). FDM requires the sending end to be transmitting at different frequencies for each individual communication channel. This demands individual tuned resonators, as well as filters to separate out the signals at the receiving end. The <b>harmonic</b> <b>telegraph</b> achieved this with electromagnetically driven tuned reeds at the transmitting end which would vibrate similar reeds at the receiving end. Only the reed with the same resonant frequency as the transmitter would vibrate to any appreciable extent at the receiving end.|$|E
500|$|Mechanical {{filter design}} was {{developed}} by applying the discoveries made in electrical filter theory to mechanics. However, a very early example (1870s) of acoustic filtering was the [...] "harmonic telegraph", which arose precisely because electrical resonance was poorly understood but mechanical resonance (in particular, acoustic resonance) was very familiar to engineers. This situation was not to last for long; electrical resonance had been known to science for some time before this, {{and it was not}} long before engineers started to produce all-electric designs for filters. In its time, though, the <b>harmonic</b> <b>telegraph</b> was of some importance. The idea was to combine several telegraph signals on one telegraph line by what would now be called frequency division multiplexing thus saving enormously on line installation costs. The key of each operator activated a vibrating electromechanical reed which converted this vibration into an electrical signal. Filtering at the receiving operator was achieved by a similar reed tuned to precisely the same frequency, which would only vibrate and produce a sound from transmissions by the operator with the identical tuning.|$|E
2500|$|By 1874, Bell's initial {{work on the}} <b>harmonic</b> <b>telegraph</b> {{had entered}} a {{formative}} stage, with progress made both at his new Boston [...] "laboratory" [...] (a rented facility) and at his family home in Canada a big success. While working that summer in Brantford, Bell experimented with a [...] "phonautograph", a pen-like machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on smoked glass by tracing their vibrations. Bell {{thought it might be}} possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves. Bell also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the undulating currents back into sound. But he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas.|$|E
2500|$|Elisha Gray, of Highland Park, Illinois (near Chicago) also {{devised a}} tone {{telegraph}} {{of this kind}} {{about the same time}} as La Cour. In Gray's tone telegraph, several vibrating steel reeds tuned to different frequencies interrupted the current, which at the other end of the line passed through electromagnets and vibrated matching tuned steel reeds near the electromagnet poles. Gray's 'harmonic telegraph,' with vibrating reeds, was used by the Western Union Telegraph Company. Since more than one set of vibration frequencies – that is to say, more than one musical tone – can be sent over the same wire simultaneously, the <b>harmonic</b> <b>telegraph</b> can be utilized as a 'multiplex' or many-ply telegraph, conveying several messages through the same wire at the same time. Each message can either be read by an operator by the sound, or from different tones read by different operators, or a permanent record can be made by the marks drawn on a ribbon of traveling paper by a Morse recorder. On July 27, 1875, Gray was granted U.S. patent 166,096 for [...] "Electric Telegraph for Transmitting Musical Tones" [...] (the harmonic) ...|$|E

50|$|Elisha Gray was a {{prominent}} inventor in Highland Park, Illinois. His Western Electric company was a major supplier to the telegraph company Western Union. In 1874, Bell was in competition with Elisha Gray {{to be the first}} to invent the practical <b>harmonic</b> <b>telegraph.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1874, Gray {{developed}} a <b>harmonic</b> <b>telegraph</b> device using vibrating reeds that could transmit musical tones, but not intelligible speech. In December 1874, he demonstrated {{it to the public}} at Highland Park First Presbyterian Church. On February 11, 1876, Gray [...] On February 14, Gray's lawyer filed a patent caveat with a similar diagram. The same day, Bell's lawyer filed (hand-delivered to the U.S. Patent Office) a patent application on the <b>harmonic</b> <b>telegraph,</b> including its use for transmitting vocal sounds. On February 19, the patent office suspended Bell's application for three months to give Gray time to submit a full patent application with claims, after which the patent office would begin interference proceedings to determine whether Bell or Gray were first to invent the claimed subject matter of the telephone.|$|E
50|$|In 1874, Gray {{retired to}} do {{independent}} research and development. Gray {{applied for a}} patent on a <b>harmonic</b> <b>telegraph</b> which consisted of multi-tone transmitters, that controlled each tone with a separate telegraph key. Gray gave several private demonstrations of this invention in New York and Washington, D.C. in May and June 1874.|$|E

50|$|Helmholtz {{showed that}} {{different}} combinations of resonator could mimic vowel sounds: Alexander Graham Bell in particular was interested in this but, {{not being able to}} read German, misconstrued Helmholtz' diagrams as meaning that Helmholtz had transmitted multiple frequencies by wire—which would allow multiplexing of telegraph signals—whereas, in reality, electrical power was used only to keep the resonators in motion. Bell failed to reproduce what he thought Helmholtz had done but later said that, had he been able to read German, he would not have gone on to invent the telephone on the <b>harmonic</b> <b>telegraph</b> principle.
