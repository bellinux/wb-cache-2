40|$|Cytochrome P 450 (CYP) {{constitutes}} a superfamily of hemeproteins that {{plays a key}} role in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics. Xenobiotic interactions are a major reason for druginduced toxicity and multiple drug therapy and/or the concomitant use of herbal medicine is common, particularly in patients with several diseases or conditions. A popular assay to evaluate in vitro interactions is the cocktail method using pooled microsomes to simultaneous determine several CYP activities. Hops (Humulus lupulus) is a herb often recommended for sleep deprivations and menopausal problems in women. The aim of this thesis was to develop an in vitro cocktail method based on Inje’s in vivo cocktail to investigate the inhibitory potential of natural remedies and other potential CYP inhibitors toward the CYP enzymes 1 A 2, 2 C 9, 2 C 19, 2 D 6 and 3 A 4. The final method was tested using hops as a CYP trial inhibitor. The conducted pilot study gave indications of substrate concentrations, HLM concentration and incubation time for the cocktail method, and the method was further optimized. Addition of MgCl 2, ethanol inhibition and substrate specificity was also investigated. The following conditions were chosen; 20 µM phenacetin, 2 µM losartan, 2 µM omeprazole, 10 µM dextromethorphan and 10 µM midazolam, incubated with 0. 4 mg proteins/mL HLM for 20 minutes. Maximum ethanol concentration was 1 %. Substrates and metabolites were analyzed by an adapted and validated LC-MSMS method. The inhibitory potential of two types of <b>hops,</b> <b>dried</b> hops and the dietary supplement Hops Flowers, were investigated. All five CYP enzymes were inhibited by hops, but to a different extent, evaluated by calculated IC 50 -values. Ethanol extracted hops had lower IC 50 -values compared to water extracted hops. The order of inhibition was as following: CYP 2 C 9 was the most affected, then 3 A 4, 2 C 19 or 1 A 2 and 2 D 6 being the least affected. In this thesis a cocktail method was developed, validated and showed to be functional. An LCMSMS method was adapted and validated. In vitro «cocktail» inhibition studies are cheap, effective and relatively easy to perform. Even though extrapolation of in vitro data to humans have many limitations, in vitro cocktail inhibition studies are useful to get increased knowledge of CYP interactions between herbal and conventional medicines...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The Humulus lupulus L. plant (hops) {{is used as}} a herbal {{medicinal}} product for anxiety/mood disorders. Our aim was to study the effects of a <b>hops</b> <b>dry</b> extract on self-reported depression, anxiety and stress levels in young adults. DESIGN: Apparently healthy young adults from our university completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale- 21 (DASS- 21) and those reporting at least mild depression, anxiety and stress were invited to complete the study intervention. This followed a randomized (1 : 1), placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design with two 4 -week intervention periods (hops or placebo; two 0. 2 gr capsules once daily) separated by a 2 -week wash-out. Anthropometric measurements, DASS- 21 assessments and measurements of morning cortisol plasma levels were performed at {{the beginning and the end}} of the 4 -week treatment periods. RESULTS: 36 participants (Females/Males: 31 / 5; age: 24. 7 ± 0. 5 years) completed the study intervention (attrition: 6 / 42). No significant changes in body weight and composition or morning circulating cortisol were noted with the hops or placebo. Significantly decreased DASS- 21 anxiety, depression and stress scores were documented with hops (9. 2 ± 7. 3 vs. 5. 1 ± 5. 9, 11. 9 ± 7. 9 vs. 9. 2 ± 7. 4, and 19. 1 ± 8. 1 vs. 11. 6 ± 8. 1; all p values < 0. 05), which were significantly greater compared to those caused by the placebo (all p values < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: In otherwise healthy young adults reporting at least mild depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, daily supplementation with a <b>hops</b> <b>dry</b> extract can significantly improve all these symptoms over a 4 -week period. These beneficial effects agree with the indication of hops for anxiety/mood disorders and restlessness, as approved by the German Commission E...|$|R
