As such, Maylam suggested that the author may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> in describing the use of a horse's skull in the Ramsgate tradition, given that both later sources and the hoodeners of his own time all used a wooden model of a horse's head. At the same time, Maylam noted that the use of a horse's skull was not impossible, for such skulls had also been used in the hobby horse traditions of other parts of Britain.|$|E
5|$|Mark Teixeira {{tied the}} game with a solo home run in the fourth inning, and Hideki Matsui broke the tie in the sixth with another solo homer. Martínez {{departed}} the game after giving up consecutive hits to Jerry Hairston, Jr. and Melky Cabrera to start the seventh inning, and reliever Chan Ho Park gave up an RBI single to Jorge Posada. With Cabrera at second base and Posada at first, Johnny Damon hit a low line drive at Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard. Howard grabbed the ball and threw to second where Posada was tagged and called out while standing on the base. First-base umpire Brian Gorman ruled that Howard had caught the ball in the air and thus the result was an inning-ending double play. This was the first of two calls by Gorman in this game which were later shown to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> by video replays.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of a barbiturate induction agent and a nondepolarizing paralytic agent is used in thousands of anesthetics every day. Supporters {{of the death penalty}} argue that unless anesthesiologists <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> for the last 40 years, the use of pentothal and pancuronium is safe and effective. In fact, potassium is given in heart bypass surgery to induce cardioplegia. Therefore, the {{combination of}} these three drugs is still in use today. Supporters of the death penalty speculate that the designers of the lethal-injection protocols intentionally used the same drugs as used in everyday surgery to avoid controversy. The only modification is that a massive coma-inducing dose of barbiturates is given. In addition, similar protocols have been used in countries that support euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide.|$|E

Gupte himself received [...] "many painful letters and phone calls" [...] from Indian parents.

The line of description called for Logan to [...] "devour" [...] Veronica.

500|$|When Linnaeus reached Harderwijk, {{he began}} working towards a degree immediately; at the time, Harderwijk was known for {{awarding}} [...] "instant" [...] degrees after {{as little as a}} week. First he handed in a thesis on the cause of malaria he had written in Sweden, which he then defended in a public debate. His dissertation, submitted on 23 June, was titled Dissertatio medica inauguralis in qua exhibetur hypothesis nova de febrium intermittentium causa ("Inaugural thesis in medicine, in which a new hypothesis on the cause of intermittent fevers is presented"). He concluded that malaria arose only in places with clay-rich soil. He is now known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> about the cause, not having a microscope good enough to see malarial parasites, which were spread by mosquitoes breeding in the water that collected in ruts and puddles. But he was right in predicting that traditional Chinese medicine, including the use of wormwood (Artemisia), is a potential source of antimalarial drugs; Artemisinins, derived from wormwood, are now the principal antimalarial drugs.|$|E

2500|$|Dawkins {{continues}} {{with a discussion}} of what he sees as a conflict between faith and science (see conflict thesis). He points out that science involves a process of constantly testing and revising theories in the light of new evidence, while faith makes a virtue out of believing unprovable and often improbable propositions. For an example of faith, Dawkins takes the infallible doctrine of the Assumption, which Pope Pius XII declared in 1950 by relying upon tradition. He contrasts this with the scientific method, which he describes as a system whereby working assumptions may be falsified by recourse to reason and evidence. Dawkins provides an example from his undergraduate study, when a visiting researcher disproved a hypothesis of a professor, who accepted the outcome with [...] "My dear fellow, I wish to thank you, I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> these fifteen years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rowell was {{replaced}} by Lieutenant General Edmund Herring, a man close to Blamey. Now Herring chose Brigadier Ivan Dougherty to replace Potts. During his recent period of command in the Northern Territory, Herring had relieved both his brigadiers, replacing them with younger and better educated officers, {{one of whom was}} Dougherty, an officer in whom he had great confidence. Herring believed that his decision to replace Potts with Dougherty, who would command the 21st Brigade {{for the rest of the}} war, was the right one. Years later he told official historian Dudley McCarthy that: [...] "We knew the terrain was most difficult and the Japs very good jungle fighters ... we had a war [...] to win and it was our job to call in the best man we could. It would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> for us to allow ourselves to be influenced by Potts' feelings." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hayek's {{influence}} {{on the development of}} economics is widely acknowledged. Hayek is the second-most frequently cited economist (after Kenneth Arrow) in the Nobel lectures of the prize winners in economics, which is particularly striking since his own lecture was critical of the field of orthodox economics and neo-classical modelisation. A number of Nobel Laureates in economics, such as Vernon Smith and Herbert A. Simon, recognise Hayek as the greatest modern economist. Another Nobel winner, Paul Samuelson, believed that Hayek was worthy of his award but nevertheless claimed that [...] "there were good historical reasons for fading memories of Hayek within the mainstream last {{half of the twentieth century}} economist fraternity. In 1931, Hayek's Prices and Production had enjoyed an ultra-short Byronic success. In retrospect hindsight tells us that its mumbo-jumbo about the period of production grossly misdiagnosed the macroeconomics of the 1927–1931 (and the 1931–2007) historical scene". Despite this comment, Samuelson spent the last 50 years of his life obsessed with the problems of capital theory identified by Hayek and Böhm-Bawerk, and Samuelson flatly judged Hayek to have been right and his own teacher, Joseph Schumpeter, to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> on the central economic question of the 20th century, the feasibility of socialist economic planning in a production goods dominated economy.|$|E

It was widely interpreted as meaning that Coulter had called Edwards a [...] "faggot," [...] but Coulter argued {{that she did not}} actually do so, while simultaneously indicating she would not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> to say it. Edwards responded on his web site by characterizing Coulter's words as [...] "un-American and indefensible," [...] and asking readers to help him [...] "raise $100,000 in 'Coulter Cash' this week to keep this campaign charging ahead and fight back against the politics of bigotry." [...] He also called her a [...] "she-devil," [...] adding, [...] "I should not have name-called. But the truth is—forget the names—people like Ann Coulter, they engage in hateful language." [...] Coulter's words also drew condemnation from many prominent Republicans and Democrats, as well as groups such as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). Three advertisers (Verizon, Sallie Mae and Netbank) also pulled their advertisements from Coulter's web site, and several newspapers dropped her column. Coulter responded in an e-mail to the New York Times, [...] "C’mon, it was a joke. I would never insult gays by suggesting that they are like John Edwards. That would be mean." [...] On March 5, 2007, she appeared on Hannity and Colmes and said, [...] "Faggot isn't offensive to gays; {{it has nothing to do}} with gays. It's a schoolyard taunt meaning 'wuss.'" [...] Gay rights advocates were not convinced. [...] "Ann Coulter's use of this anti-gay slur is vile and unacceptable," [...] said Neil G. Giuliano, president of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, [...] "and the applause from her audience is an important reminder that Coulter's ugly brand of bigotry is at the root of the discriminatory policies being promoted at this gathering." [...] A spokesman for Sen. John McCain, a Republican presidential candidate, called Coulter's comments [...] "wildly inappropriate." ...|$|E
