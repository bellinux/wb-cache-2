5|$|In late 2008, Aamer Ahmed Khan of the BBC Urdu {{website and}} his colleagues {{came up with a}} novel way of {{covering}} the Taliban's growing influence in Swat. They decided to ask a schoolgirl to blog anonymously about her life there. Their correspondent in Peshawar, Abdul Hai Kakar, had been in touch with a local school teacher, Ziauddin Yousafzai, but could not find any students willing to do so, as it was considered too dangerous by their families. Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11-year-old Malala. At the time, Taliban militants led by Maulana Fazlullah were taking over the Swat Valley, banning television, music, girls' education, and women from going shopping. Bodies of beheaded policemen were being displayed in town squares. At first, a girl named Aisha from her father's school agreed to write a diary, but then the girl's parents stopped her <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> because they feared Taliban reprisals. The only alternative was Yousafzai, four years younger than the original volunteer, and in seventh grade at the time. Editors at the BBC unanimously agreed.|$|E
25|$|When {{children}} first learn how lying works, {{they lack the}} moral understanding of when to refrain <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> This takes years of watching people tell lies, {{and the results of}} these lies, to develop a proper understanding. Propensity to lie varies greatly between children, some doing so habitually and others being habitually honest. Habits in this regard are likely to change in early adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Castellano's {{most vocal}} critic was John Gotti, a Queens-based capo and Dellacroce protégé. Gotti was ambitious {{and wanted to}} be boss himself. He was also angry that Castellano allowed the DeMeo crew to deal in {{narcotics}} while forbidding him <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> Gotti and his men conducted their drug trade in secret. The 1983 Ruggiero indictment came from phone conversations that Federal agents had recorded on Gotti's phone. The taped conversations included Ruggiero discussing drug deals and expressing his contempt for Castellano. By law, the defendants were allowed transcripts of these wiretap conversations to aid their defense. Castellano immediately demanded copies for himself. Dellacroce kept the transcripts from Castellano – the drug dealing and disrespectful language on the transcripts would have given Castellano cause to kill both Ruggiero and John Gotti. In turn, Dellacroce prevented Gotti from deposing Castellano, citing his promise to Carlo Gambino.|$|E

500|$|Lisa {{begins to}} oppose other {{examples}} of common thievery all around her, even convincing Marge to pay the cost on two grapes she sampled in a grocery store. Lisa later pays a visit to Reverend Lovejoy at church, where he suggests that Lisa cannot turn her father in to the police for the illegal hook-up, since she must continue to [...] "Honour Thy Father and Thy Mother", according to the Fifth Commandment. He instead encourages Lisa to not watch anything on Homer's cable hook-up, setting a good example that he hopes others will follow. Marge pleads with Homer to either cut the cable or pay for it, but he refuses to do either, saying that the cable will {{stay as long as}} he desires. Meanwhile, Bart sets up posters on the back door for his showing of a porn channel for 50 cents, but he is caught a few seconds later by Homer, who forbids him <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Two {{years after}} the World Cup, on 1 June 1968, the two teams met again in another {{friendly}} match, this time in West Germany, in which the Germans won their first victory over an English team, 38 {{years after the}}y had first played. The scoreline was 1–0, Franz Beckenbauer scoring for West Germany, but as Hugh McIlvanney wrote in his match report for The Observer: [...] "Comparing this miserable {{hour and a half}} (in which fouls far outnumbered examples of creative football) with the last great meeting between the countries is entirely fatuous. But that will not prevent the Germans <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> Their celebrations will not be inhibited by the knowledge that today's losers were almost a reserve team, and even the agonies of boredom they shared with us will now seem worthwhile. They have beaten England, and that is enough." ...|$|E

5000|$|What you {{are really}} doing is, you’re finding {{the source of the}} 'I'. You're looking for the source of 'I', the {{personal}} 'I'. 'Who am I?'

Pose those questions, but never answer them ... do nothing, absolutely nothing. You're watching the thoughts come. As soon as the thoughts come, in a gentle way you enquire, 'To whom do these thoughts come? They come to me. I think them. Who is this I? Where <b>did</b> <b>it</b> come <b>from?</b> How <b>did</b> <b>it</b> arise? <b>From</b> where <b>did</b> <b>it</b> arise? Who is the I? Who am I?' You remain still. The thoughts come again.
