5|$|SIM's new {{technology}} {{was meant to}} lead to the development of telescopes powerful enough to take images of Earth-like extrasolar planets orbiting distant stars and to determine whether those planets are able to sustain life. NASA <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>started</b> developing future missions that will build on SIM's technological legacy. The technological development phase of the mission was completed in November 2006 with the announcement that the eight, mission-technology-milestones set by NASA were reached. The milestones were necessary steps in the technological development before flight control instruments could begin to be designed. The completion of each milestone meant that new systems had to be developed for nanometer control as well as picometer knowledge technology; these systems enable the telescope to make its accurate measurements with extreme accuracy.|$|E

25|$|The Qur'an {{commands}} Muslims to make {{a proper}} declaration of war prior to the commencement of military operations. Thus, surprise attacks are illegal under the Islamic jurisprudence.

This rule, however, is not binding if the adversary <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>started</b> the war. Forcible prevention of religious practice is considered an act of war.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Boruto's {{character has}} been generally mixed. Upon first seeing him Ramsey Isler from IGN found him too similar {{to his father}}. On the other hand, Andy Hanley from UK Anime Network said despite his similar design and actions to his father Naruto, Boruto is not like him and has a different personality. Amy McNulty from Anime News Network and Hanley enjoyed Boruto's relationship with his father Naruto due to the differences in their childhoods and how that becomes {{the focus of the}} film Boruto: Naruto the Movie. McNulty also liked how Boruto develops as he became afraid of his father's fate during an attack from the antagonist. She praised Amanda C. Miller's role as Boruto's English actor, but feeling the voice often sounded more feminine that his Japanese counterpart. Christian Chiok from Japanator enjoyed Boruto's character development, his relationship with his father, and how heartwarming it becomes in the movie. Alexandria Hill from Otaku USA enjoyed Boruto's fight against the film's villain and his team up with Naruto and Sasuke. Chris Zimmerman from DVD Talk noted how the writers fairly conceived Boruto's poor relationship with his father and how it improves during the climax of the film. Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network praised how the writers manage to develop Boruto's angst without coming across as [...] "teen whinning" [...] and how Sasuke Uchiha decides to train him upon seeing his similarities with his father. Leroy Douresseaux liked how Boruto's character <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>started</b> development by the second volume of the series.|$|E
