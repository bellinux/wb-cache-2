25|$|While the {{introduction}} of the Mark 4 nuclear bomb to replace the Fat Man (the Mark 3) in 1949 caused few problems, that of the Mark 5 nuclear bomb in 1951 required extensive re-tooling. The Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory and Salt Wells Pilot Plant staffs agreed to adopt direct machining of the explosive components. While this was <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> additional heat, tests at both sites had been conducted without an explosive accident. Further re-tooling was required for the Mark 12 nuclear bomb explosives, which the Salt Wells Pilot Plant began manufacturing in 1953. It also began tooling up for the Mark 13 nuclear bomb.|$|E
25|$|The unique {{feature of}} this whistle is that the tone sounds only with flow through the orifice from outside; it is an {{acoustical}} diode. A cylindrical cavity with a small circular, square-edged hole {{at one end and}} totally open at the other is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> a tone when air is passed through it. It is subject to frequency jumps and hysteresis loops similar to the hole tone. There appear to be two stages and the feedback is likely Class II if the tube is short. The fundamental tone occurs near λ=4L, so one characteristic dimension is L, the length of the tube. The characteristic speed U is that of the flow through the hole.|$|E

An intramuscular injection of ketamine was recently demonstrated to induce a gaze holding failure. The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyse if ketamine produced this effect by acting, at least in part, on the PH nucleus. We found that a unilateral injection of a small amount of ketamine in the PH nucleus could cause either bilateral horizontal gaze holding failure or a vertical gaze holding failure or both an horizontal and a vertical gaze holding failure.

2500|$|A later {{theory was}} that a torpedo may have {{exploded}} in the tube, caused by an uncontrollable fire in the torpedo room. The book [...] documents findings and investigation by Dr. John Craven, who surmised that a likely cause {{could have been the}} overheating of a faulty battery. The Mark 46 silver-zinc battery used in the Mark 37 torpedo had a tendency to overheat, and in extreme cases could cause a fire that was strong enough to cause a low-order detonation of the warhead. If such a detonation had occurred, it might have opened the boat's large torpedo-loading hatch and caused Scorpion to flood and sink. However, while Mark 46 batteries have been <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> so much heat that the torpedo casings blistered, none is known to have damaged a boat or caused an explosion.|$|E
