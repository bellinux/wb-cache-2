50|$|Hare stew is {{included}} in volume 2 of Le Ménagier de Paris, which {{was first published in}} print form by Baron Jérôme Pichon in 1846. This recipe called for the use of several spices, including ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> cloves and pepper, or other exotic spices. These spices were expensive during this time.|$|E
5000|$|Pepper Coast was {{the name}} given by European traders to a coastal area of western Africa, between Cape Mesurado and Cape Palmas. It {{encloses}} the present republic of Liberia. It got {{its name from the}} melegueta pepper. The pepper is also known as the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> which gave rise to an alternative name, the Grain Coast. The importance of the spice is shown by the designation of the area from the Saint John River (at present-day Buchanan) to Harper in Liberia as the [...] "Grain Coast" [...] in reference to the availability of grains of paradise. In some cases (as shown on the map) this term covers a wider area incorporating Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast.|$|E

50|$|Alligator pepper (also {{known as}} mbongo spice or hepper pepper) is a West African spice which {{corresponds}} to the seeds and seed pods of Aframomum danielli, A. citratum or A. exscapum. It is a close relative <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> obtained from the closely related species, Aframomum melegueta. However, unlike <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> which are generally sold as only {{the seeds of the}} plant, alligator pepper is sold as the entire pod containing the seeds (in the same manner to another close relative, black cardamom).|$|R
5000|$|Paradol is {{the active}} flavor {{constituent}} {{of the seeds}} of Guinea pepper (Aframomum melegueta or <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise).</b> [...] It {{is also found in}} ginger. [...] Paradol has been found to have antioxidant and antitumor promoting effects in a mouse model.|$|R
50|$|Aframomum melegueta is {{a species}} in the ginger family, Zingiberaceae. This spice, {{commonly}} known as ossame, <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> Melegueta pepper, alligator pepper, Guinea grains, fom wisa, or Guinea pepper, is obtained from the ground seeds; it imparts a pungent, peppery flavour with hints of citrus.|$|R
50|$|Akvavit, like vodka, is {{distilled}} {{from either}} grain or potatoes. After distillation, it is flavoured with herbs, spices, or fruit oil. Commonly seen flavours are caraway, cardamom, cumin, anise, fennel, and lemon or orange peel. Dill and <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> are also used. The Danish distillery Aalborg makes an akvavit distilled with amber.|$|R
5000|$|Calulu is a {{traditional}} dish prepared with grouper or smoked fish, prawns, tomato, okra, aubergines (eggplant), onion, and spices, including <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise.</b> Some versions <b>of</b> the dish may include or use smoked chicken, breadfruit, óssame (a red, bulbous fruit) or bananas. It takes around five hours for traditional calulu to be prepared.|$|R
5000|$|In West African folk medicine, <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> {{are valued}} for their warming and {{digestive}} properties, {{and among the}} Efik people in Nigeria {{have been used for}} divination and ordeals determining guilt.

5|$|Bombay Sapphire gin is {{flavored with}} {{botanicals}} including cubeb and <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise.</b> The brand {{was launched in}} 1987, but its maker claims that {{it is based on}} a secret recipe dating to 1761. Pertsovka, a dark brown Russian pepper vodka with a burning taste, is prepared from infusion of cubeb and capsicum peppers.|$|R
5000|$|The Forme of Cury, {{a medieval}} English cookery book from 1390, which {{mentioned}} mulled wine, says: [...] "Pur fait Ypocras …" [...] grinding together cinnamon, ginger, galangal, cloves, long pepper, nutmeg, marjoram, cardamom and <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> ("spykenard de Spayn", rosemary may be substituted). This {{is mixed with}} red wine and sugar (form and quantity unstated).|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The ethanolic extract <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> (Aframomum melegueta Schum, Zingiberaceae) {{has been}} {{evaluated}} for inhibitory activity on cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) enzyme, in vivo for the anti-inflammatory activity and expression of several pro-inflammatory genes. Bioactivity-guided fractionation {{showed that the}} most active COX- 2 inhibitory compound in the extract was [6]-paradol. [6]-Shogaol, another compound from the extract, was the most active inhibitory compound in pro-inflammatory gene expression assays. In a rat paw edema model, the whole extract reduced inflammation by 49 % at 1000 mg/kg. Major gingerols from the extract [6]-paradol, [6]-gingerol, and [6]-shogaol reduced inflammation by 20, 25 and 38 %. respectively when administered individually at a dose of 150 mg/kg. [6]-Shogaol efficacy was {{at the level of}} aspirin, used as a positive control. <b>Grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> extract has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory activity, which is in part due to the inhibition of COX- 2 enzyme activity and expression of pro-inflammatory genes...|$|R
50|$|Even in West Africa, {{alligator}} pepper is {{an expensive}} spice, so is used sparingly. Often, a single whole pod is pounded in a pestle and mortar before half of it is added (along with black pepper) as a flavouring to West African soups or boiled rice. The spice can also be substituted in any recipe using <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> or black cardamom to provide a hotter and more pungent flavour.|$|R
5000|$|Powder-douce (poudre-douce), {{literally}} [...] "sweet powder," [...] is a spice mix used in Medieval and Renaissance cookery. Like modern spice mixes such as [...] "Italian seasoning," [...] "garam masala," [...] "taco seasoning," [...] etc., {{there was}} not a set ingredient list, it varied from cook to cook. The author of the 14th-century manuscript Le Menagier de Paris suggested a mix <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, sugar, and galangal.|$|R
5000|$|Qâlat daqqa (also spelled gâlat dagga), or Tunisian Five Spices, is a spice blend {{originating}} from Tunisia. It {{is made of}} cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, peppercorns, and <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> mixed and ground, depending on its use, between a coarse grind and a fine powder. This spice blend is used to as both an aromatic and seasoning for meats and vegetable dishes. The flavor of the mixture is described as being [...] "sweet and warm".|$|R
50|$|Pastis Henri Bardouin is a French pastis made by Distilleries et Domaines de Provence. It {{contains}} more than 65 different herbs and spices, including mugwort, star anise, centaury, <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> cardamom, black and white pepper, tonka bean, nutmeg, cloves, garden angelica, cinnamon, lemon balm, sage, rosemary, licorice, thyme, lemon verbena, sweet woodruff, coriander, borage, wall germander, St John's wort, kidney vetch, wild thyme, chamomile, melilot, oregano, large leaved lime and fennel. The other 21 ingredients are secret.|$|R
5000|$|The term <b>Grains</b> <b>of</b> Selim {{refers to}} the seeds of a shrubby tree, Xylopia aethiopica, found in Africa. It {{is also known as}} kimba pepper, African pepper, Moor pepper, Negro pepper, Kani pepper, Kili pepper, Sénégal pepper, Ethiopian pepper, Hwentea and Guinea pepper. The seeds have a musky flavor and are used as a pepper substitute. It is {{sometimes}} confused with <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise.</b> By far the most common name in Wolof is djar in Senegal, and this is how it is listed on most, if not all, Cafe Touba packages.|$|R
25|$|Popular {{botanicals}} or flavouring {{agents for}} gin, besides the required juniper, often include citrus elements, such as lemon and bitter orange peel, {{as well as}} a combination of other spices, which may include any of anise, angelica root and seed, orris root, licorice root, cinnamon, almond, cubeb, savory, lime peel, grapefruit peel, dragon eye (longan), saffron, baobab, frankincense, coriander, <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> nutmeg, cassia bark or others. The different combinations and concentrations of these botanicals in the distillation process cause the variations in taste among gin products.|$|R
50|$|Seeds of Guinea pepper (Aframomum melegueta; {{also called}} <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> or melagueta pepper), a native West African plant, {{were used as}} a spice and even reached Europe, through North African middlemen, during the Middle Ages. Centuries before the {{influence}} of Europeans, West African people were trading with the Arab world and spices like cinnamon, cloves, and mint were not unknown and {{became part of the}} local flavorings. Centuries later, the Portuguese, French and British influenced the regional cuisines, but only to a limited extent.|$|R
50|$|Today, it is {{sometimes}} used in gourmet cuisine {{as a replacement for}} pepper, and to give unique flavors in some craft beers, gins, and Norwegian akvavit. In America, <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> are starting to enjoy a slight resurgence in popularity due to their use by some well-known chefs. Alton Brown is a fan of its use, and he uses it in okra stew and his apple pie recipe on an episode of the TV cooking show Good Eats. They are also used by people on certain diets, such as a raw food diet, because they are less irritating to digestion than black pepper.|$|R
50|$|The {{flavouring}} of {{the drink}} {{comes from a}} recipe of ten ingredients: almond, lemon peel, liquorice, juniper berries, orris root, angelica, coriander, cassia, cubeb, and <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise.</b> Alcohol bought in from another supplier is evaporated three times using a carterhead still, and the alcohol vapours are passed through a mesh/basket containing the ten botanicals, {{in order to gain}} flavour and aroma. This is felt to give the gin a lighter, more floral taste compared to those gins that are created using a copper pot still. Water from Lake Vyrnwy is added to bring the strength of Bombay Sapphire down to 40.0% (UK, Canada, Australia).|$|R
5000|$|The {{importance}} of the spice is shown by the designation of the area from the St. Johns River (present day Buchanan) to Harper in Liberia as the [...] "Grain Coast" [...] {{in honor of the}} availability <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise.</b> [...] Later, the craze for the spice waned, and its uses were reduced to a flavoring for sausages and beer. In the 18th century, its importation to Great Britain collapsed after a Parliamentary act of George III forbade its use in malt liquor, aqua vita, and cordials. In 1855, England imported about 15,000 to 19,000 lbs per year legally (duty paid). By 1880, the Encyclopædia Britannica (9th edition) was reporting, [...] "Grains <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> are to some extent used in veterinary practice, {{but for the most part}} illegally to give a fictitious strength to malt liquors, gin, and cordials".|$|R
5|$|The first {{historical}} {{mention of}} the use of hops in beer was from 822 AD in monastery rules written by Adalhard the Elder, also known as Adalard of Corbie, though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century. Before the thirteenth century, and until the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer was flavoured with other plants; for instance, <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> or alehoof. Combinations of various aromatic herbs, berries, and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used. Some beers today, such as Fraoch' by the Scottish Heather Ales company and Cervoise Lancelot by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company, use plants other than hops for flavouring.|$|R
5000|$|Melegueta pepper is {{commonly}} used in the cuisines of West and North Africa, {{where it has been}} traditionally imported by caravan routes through the Sahara desert, and whence they were distributed to Sicily and the rest of Italy. Mentioned by Pliny as [...] "African pepper" [...] but subsequently forgotten in Europe, they were renamed [...] "grains of paradise" [...] and became a popular substitute for black pepper in Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries. The Ménagier de Paris recommends it for improving wine that [...] "smells stale". Through the Middle Ages and into the early modern period, the theory of the four humours governed theorizing about nourishment on the part of doctors, herbalists and druggists: in this context, John Russell characterized <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> in The Boke of Nurture as hot and moist.|$|R
50|$|Since the 16th century, {{the word}} has been {{generally}} spelled hippocras or hipocras in English and hypocras in French. Original recipes for hippocras were made until the 19th century, when it fell out of favor. This wine is made with sugar and spices. Sugar then {{was considered to be}} medicine and the spices varied according to the recipes. The main spices are: cinnamon, ginger, clove, <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> and long pepper. An English text specifies that sugar was uniquely for the lords and honey was for the people. Since the 17th century, spiced wines, in France, have been generally prepared with fruits (apples, oranges, almonds) and musk or ambergris. In England, in 1723, there was a recipe for red hippocras containing milk and brandy. The drink was well liked during medieval and Elizabethan times. Moreover, doctors prescribed it to aid digestion. It was served at most banquets all over Europe.|$|R
50|$|Spices {{were all}} {{imported}} from plantations in Asia and Africa, which made them expensive. From the 8th until the 15th century, the Republic of Venice had the monopoly on spice {{trade with the}} Middle East, and along with it the neighboring Italian maritime republics and city-states. The trade made the region rich. It {{has been estimated that}} around 1,000 tons of pepper and 1,000 tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the Late Middle Ages. The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> for 1.5 million people. The most exclusive was saffron, used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor. Spices that have now fallen into obscurity in European cuisine include <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> a relative <b>of</b> cardamom which mostly replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking, long pepper, mace, spikenard, galangal and cubeb.|$|R
5|$|Artificial {{freshwater}} ponds (often called stews) held carp, pike, tench, bream, eel, and other fish. Poultry {{was kept in}} special yards, with pigeon and squab being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as tansy, rue, pennyroyal, and hyssop, which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time – they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are cubebs, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> and galengale. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and verjus combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial {{to make use of}} nutrients.|$|R

50|$|The {{account of}} Prester John {{is taken from}} the famous Epistle of that {{imaginary}} potentate, which was widely diffused in the 13th century. Many fabulous stories, again, of monsters, such as cyclopes, sciapodes, hippopodes, anthropophagi, monoscelides, and men whose heads did grow beneath their shoulders; of the phoenix and the weeping crocodile, such as Pliny has collected, are introduced here and there, derived no doubt from him, Solinus, the bestiaries, or the Speculum naturale of Vincent de Beauvais. And interspersed, especially in the chapters about the Levant, are the stories and legends that were retailed to every pilgrim, such as the legend of Seth and the <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> from which grew the wood of the cross, that of the shooting of old Cain by Lamech, that of the castle of the sparrow-hawk (which appears in the tale of Melusine), those {{of the origin of}} the balsam plants at Masariya, of the dragon of Cos, of the river Sambation, etc.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{definitive}} composition of spices {{that makes up}} ras el hanout. Each shop, company, or family may have their own blend. The mixture usually consists of over a dozen spices, in different proportions, although some purists insist that it must contain exactly 12 items. Commonly used ingredients include cardamom, cumin, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, allspice, dry ginger, chili peppers, coriander seed, peppercorn, sweet and hot paprika, fenugreek, and dry turmeric. Some spices may be particular to the region, such as ash berries, chufa, <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> orris root, monk's pepper, cubebs, dried rosebud, fennel seed or aniseed, galangal, long pepper. Ingredients may be toasted before being ground or pounded in a mortar and mixed together. Some preparations include salt or sugar, but that is generally not the accepted practice. Garlic, saffron, nuts or dry herbs are generally not included, as they are usually added to dishes individually, but some commercial preparations, particularly in Europe and North America, may contain them.|$|R

5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|R
