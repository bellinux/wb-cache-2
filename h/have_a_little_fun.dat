500|$|The year 1984 found Como {{traveling}} the US with his 50th Anniversary tour. Having {{spent most of}} his professional life in radio or recording studios and on television soundstages, he was enjoying doing live performances. Even after his 80th birthday, Perry continued the concert tours. Gone, however, were the cardigan sweaters which had been a staple of his weekly television shows, and which he had actually hated having to wear. Como now performed in a tuxedo, saying, [...] "It shows respect for the audience." [...] The return to live appearances also provided Como with an opportunity to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> with his [...] "Mister Nice Guy" [...] image in a song Ray Charles and Nick Perito his closest collaborator since 1963, wrote and composed for him: ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{the song}} {{has never been}} {{performed}} live {{as part of a}} televised performance, the song was featured on the set list of the Loud Tour. Before she performed [...] "Skin", Rihanna appeared on stage with a set similar to that of her performance of [...] "S" [...] remix with Britney Spears at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, wearing a black tuxedo and pink tie to perform a cover of Princes [...] "Darling Nikki", before transitioning into [...] "S". As [...] "S" [...] started, Rihanna removed her tuxedo to reveal a white PVC body suit. After performing [...] "S", Rihanna performed [...] "Skin" [...] while laying on raised platform, and at {{near the end of the}} performance said [...] "this is the part of the show when we like to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> [...] who wants to come up here and get freaky with me?" [...] and takes a man out of the audience and pins them down on the platform, where she provocatively and sexually gyrates and grinds him as they are lowered under the stage as the song's instrumental ends and the lights go out. Rihanna has caused controversy by occasionally opting to perform the act with a woman instead.|$|E

500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{also gave}} the episode a {{positive}} review, and opined, [...] "With the dissing of glee club temporarily put on hold, Glee {{the series was}} able to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> with Tuesday night's episode. And fun it was, with the gang of New Directions taking on Valentine's Day, with flirting, kissing and, of course, singing. Without the bullying, this was a much lighter episode of Glee, and the results {{gave way to a}} lot more laughs and story development." [...] He went on to praise Ashley Fink's performance as Lauren Zizes, and said of Puck's falling in love with Lauren, [...] "I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Canning ultimately gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10. Wyndham Wyeth of Paste went on to praise the episode for its depiction of relationships in high school, as well as the backing vocals for Salling's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls" [...] by Queen. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review and a grade of [...] "A−": Silly Love Songs' is a fine example of the show at what's very nearly its absolute best. There’s nothing too heady here, but if the show has one tone that it's nailed almost completely consistently, it’s the feeling of teenage romance, the sense that the person you're in love with is the only person you will ever be in love with [...] followed almost immediately by the crippling feeling of heartbreak, of losing that person too soon. Teenage life moves fast and is filled with heightened emotions. And like most musicals, Glee has always been at its best when it embraces those two sides of its characters' lives. As such, 'Silly Love Songs', which is pretty much just an excuse to play around with the show's many romantic pairings among its glee club characters, is a lot of fun without trying all that hard." [...] In conclusion of his review, he wrote, [...] "The best episodes play that elation and devastation off of each other. The worst episodes flounder about for some sort of emotional foothold. But when Glee just tells small, sweet stories about these kids and the ways they're trying to cope with being in high school when they know they're meant for bigger things, it can be terrific. Tonight was one of those episodes, and tonight's episode was terrific. Here's to a good February sweeps." ...|$|E

Today, thousands carry on the greatest anti-movement of our age. Punk rock, {{the end of our}} dreams..." [...] (UK/DK: A Film About Punks and Skinheads, 1983). After the intro, the band performs on a stage with Gary McCormack playing the bass guitar, Big John Duncan playing the electric guitar and Danny Heatley playing the drums. There are also occasionally clips of the band walking down the street in Scotland and are <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> and one where they walk in a building.|$|R

The young boys are horrified when they see a man in a clown mask dragging a chained woman across the lot. They manage to flee and try to get the police involved, only for the police to assume that because the adolescents are only causing more trouble.

2500|$|Huxley {{said that}} Brave New World was {{inspired}} by the utopian novels of H. G. Wells, including A Modern Utopia (1905) and Men Like Gods (1923). Wells's hopeful vision of the future's possibilities gave Huxley the idea to begin writing a parody of the novel, which became Brave New World. He {{wrote in a letter to}} Mrs. Arthur Goldsmith, an American acquaintance, that he had [...] "been <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> pulling the leg of H. G. Wells," [...] but then he [...] "got caught up in the excitement of [...] own ideas." [...] Unlike the most popular optimist utopian novels of the time, Huxley sought to provide a frightening vision of the future. Huxley referred to Brave New World as a [...] "negative utopia", somewhat influenced by Wells's own The Sleeper Awakes (dealing with subjects like corporate tyranny and behavioural conditioning) and the works of D. H. Lawrence.|$|R

Assuming that Harvard men also go to heaven (Princeton men go back to Old Nassau), I fancy that they are <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> with Dr. Phelps and Dr. Canby on the subject of Peyton Place. The jocular references to Phelps, Canby, and Old Nassau could only <b>have</b> amused <b>a</b> tiny (if elite) fraction of his readership, and thus give an impression that O'Hara is showing off his insider-like knowledge of these institutions.|$|R

5000|$|Virginia Ross Lutz of The Times/Beaver Newspapers, Pennsylvania, wrote [...] "This is one musical journey {{you might}} not want to miss, {{especially}} {{if you happen to be}} a Donnie Iris fan. The album carries us across 13 tracks and several decades with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of groove, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of pop and some classic and alternative rock. There are even a few touches of doo-wop and some punk threads thrown in. In addition to Avsec's doom-and-gloom look at [...] "Poletown," [...] the album sets a dark mood with [...] "The Stalker" [...] and [...] "Bitter Lemons."

But weaved with clever phrases, it effectively digs into and at times brings humor to life's little ironies. It offers an abundance of sin, lust, adultery, guilt, anger discouragement and cynicism. You can either listen and have some fun with it or really listen and get into some heavy thinking." ...|$|R

It pleased him. Looking back, he remembered some of the things Dick had confessed his father thought of him. Belding's sympathy had always been with the boy. But he had learned to like the old man, to find him kind and wise, and to think that perhaps college and business had not brought out the best in Richard Gale. The West had done that, however, as it had for many a wild youngster; and Belding resolved to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>fun</b> at the expense of Mr. Gale. So he began by making a few remarks that appeared to rob Dick's father of both speech and breath.|$|E
