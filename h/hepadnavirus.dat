40|$|The genomes of {{all known}} {{mammalian}} <b>hepadnaviruses</b> contain an {{open reading frame}} (ORF), designated X, located just upstream from the gene encoding the major viral nucleocapsid polypeptide. This gene {{is believed to have}} one or more roles central to the life cycle of these viruses. Consequently, it is surprising that avian <b>hepadnaviruses</b> appear to lack this ORF. However, the observation that the size and position of the core gene in the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) genome and the heron hepatitis B virus (HHBV) genome is comparable to the combined X and core genes of the mammalian <b>hepadnaviruses</b> suggests that X function(s) may be performed by the major nucleocapsid polypeptide of DHBV and HHBV. Computer-assisted analyses were carried out to test the hypothesis that the primary and secondary structural characteristics of the X gene product are also present in the major core gene product of the duck (DHBcAg) and heron (HHBcAg) viruses. Primary sequence comparison of the major core-associated polypeptides encoded by the avian and mammalian <b>hepadnaviruses</b> demonstrates considerable homology at both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of these components. However, the middle portion of the DHBcAg and HHBcAg polypeptide, spanning about half the molecule, is unique. Comparison of this region with the carboxyl-terminal half of the X gene sequences from mammalian <b>hepadnaviruses</b> demonstrates similarities in both primary sequence and secondary structural characteristics. These results suggest that X-like gene product sequences are present in the core gene products of DHBV and HHBV. In addition, a sequence of about two dozen residues at the amino terminus of the mammalian X gene product, overlapping the polymerase gene product, is found in the corresponding position in DHBV. This is consistent with the conclusion that the relationship between the DHBV and HHBV core genes compared to the X and core genes of the mammalian <b>hepadnaviruses</b> may be explained by one or more translocations in the this region of the viral genome. The previous finding of X antigen determinants associated with one or more core-related polypeptides in the mammalian <b>hepadnaviruses,</b> combined with the results of this study, suggests that X gene product function is conserved among these viruses...|$|R

40|$|<b>Hepadnaviruses</b> are DNA {{viruses that}} are found in several {{mammalian}} and avian species. These viruses replicate their genome through reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate termed pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). pgRNA is reverse transcribed by the viral polymerase into a minus-strand DNA, followed by synthesis of the plus-strand DNA. There are multiple cis-acting sequences {{that contribute to the}} synthesis of minus-strand DNA for human hepatitis B virus (HBV). Less is known about the cis-acting sequences of avian <b>hepadnaviruses</b> that contribute to synthesis of minus-strand DNA. To identify cis-acting sequences of duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and heron hepatitis B virus (HHBV), we analyzed variants containing 200 -nucleotide (nt) deletions. Most variants of DHBV synthesized minus-strand DNA to 50 to 100 % of the wild-type (WT) level, while two variants synthesized less than 50 %. For HHBV, most variants synthesized minus-strand DNA to less than 50 % the WT level. These results differ from those for HBV, where most of the genome can be removed with little consequence. HBV contains a sequence, φ, that contributes to the synthesis of minus-strand DNA. It has been proposed that DHBV has an analogous sequence. We determined that the proposed φ sequence of DHBV does not contribute to the synthesis of minus-strand DNA. Finally, we found that the DR 2 sequence present in all <b>hepadnaviruses</b> is important for synthesis of minus-strand DNA in both DHBV and HHBV but not in HBV.

Surface proteins of all <b>hepadnaviruses</b> contain conserved functional TLMs. Genetic inactivation of the duck HBV TLMs does not interfere with viral morphogenesis; however, these mutants are noninfectious. TLM mutant viruses bind to cells and are taken up into the endosomal compartment, but they cannot escape from endosomes. Processing of surface protein by endosomal proteases induces their exposure on the virus surface. This unmasking of TLMs mediates translocation of viral particles across the endosomal membrane into the cytosol, a prerequisite for productive infection. The ability of unmasked TLMs to translocate processed HBV particles across cellular membranes was shown by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and by infection of nonpermissive cell lines with HBV processed in vitro with endosomal lysate. Based on these data, we propose an infectious entry mechanism unique for <b>hepadnaviruses</b> that involves virus internalization by receptor-mediated endocytosis followed by processing of surface protein in endosomes.

By using an octapeptide region as the sole criterion for "taxonomic" classification, we have grouped the oncoviruses into two distinct categories and the lentiviruses and <b>hepadnaviruses</b> into two additional groupings.

40|$|Abstract Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a {{major cause}} of liver {{infection}} in human. Because of the lack of an appropriate cell culture system for supporting HBV infection efficiently, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of <b>hepadnavirus</b> infection remain incompletely understood. Duck heptatitis B virus (DHBV) can naturally infect primary duck hepatocytes (PDHs) that provide valuable model systems for studying <b>hepadnavirus</b> infection in vitro. In this report, we explored global changes in cellular protein expression in DHBV infected PDHs by two-dimension gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) combined with MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Results The effects of <b>hepadnavirus</b> infection on hepatocytes were investigated in DHBV infected PDHs by the 2 -DE analysis. Proteomic profile of PDHs infected with DHBV were analyzed at 24, 72 and 120 h post-infection by comparing with uninfected PDHs, and 75 differentially expressed protein spots were revealed by 2 -DE analysis. Among the selected protein spots, 51 spots were identified corresponding to 42 proteins by MS/MS analysis; most of them were matched to orthologous proteins of Gallus gallus, Anas platyrhynchos or other avian species, including alpha-enolase, lamin A, aconitase 2, cofilin- 2 and annexin A 2, etc. The down-regulated expression of beta-actin and annexin A 2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis, and potential roles of some differentially expressed proteins in the virus-infected cells have been discussed. Conclusions Differentially expressed proteins of DHBV infected PDHs revealed by 2 -DE, are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, stress responses and cytoskeleton processes etc, providing the insight to understanding of interactions between <b>hepadnavirus</b> and hepatocytes and molecular mechanisms of <b>hepadnavirus</b> pathogenesis. </p...|$|E

In contrast to retroviruses, proviral integration is not required for <b>hepadnavirus</b> replication; however, some of the viral DNAs in the nucleus are diverted into an integration pathway. Under certain conditions these integrations function as carcinogenic agents. In order to study the integration process, we have utilized LMH-D 2 cells, which replicate wild-type duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), to develop the first protocol to detect and characterize integrations of DHBV originating from episomal viral DNAs. Contrary to expectations, our results showed that stable new integrations are readily detectable in subclones of LMH-D 2 cells. Complete characterization of one integration revealed a single-genome-length integrant with the structure of double-stranded linear (DSL) DHBV DNAs which are produced by in situ priming during viral replication. The integration contained a terminal redundancy of 6 bp from the r region of the virus DNA minus strand as well as a direct repeat of 70 bp of cellular DNA. On the basis of the structure of the integrant and the cellular DNA target site, we propose a molecular model for the integration mechanism that has some similarities to that of retroviruses.

In this study, applying the woodchuck model of acute hepatitis B, the hepatic kinetics of <b>hepadnavirus</b> replication and activation of genes encoding cytokines, cytotoxicity effectors, and immune cell markers were quantified in sequential liver biopsies collected from 1 h postinoculation onward by sensitive real-time cDNA amplification assays. The results revealed that <b>hepadnavirus</b> replication is established in the liver as early as 1 hour after infection. In 3 to 6 h, significantly augmented intrahepatic transcription of gamma interferon and interleukin- 12 were evident, suggesting activation of antigen-presenting cells. In 48 to 72 h, NK and NKT cells were activated and virus replication was transiently but significantly reduced, implying that this early innate response is at least partially successful in limiting virus propagation. Nonetheless, T cells were activated 4 to 5 weeks later when hepatitis became histologically evident. Collectively, our data demonstrate that virus replication is initiated and the innate response activated in the liver soon after exposure to a liver-pathogenic dose of <b>hepadnavirus.</b> Nevertheless, this response is unable to prompt a timely adaptive T-cell response, in contrast to infections caused by other viral pathogens...|$|E
