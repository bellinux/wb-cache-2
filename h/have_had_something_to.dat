5|$|On 15 November 2004, Shaftesbury's Nice-based lawyer, Thierry Bensaude {{reported}} him missing, {{after being}} contacted by his girlfriend, Orche. The peer divided {{his time between}} the Riviera and a home in Hove, East Sussex. He had been due to return home on 10 November. After not hearing from Shaftesbury in a week, they remained concerned when he failed {{to return to his}} rented flat in Adelaide Crescent, Hove. Bensaude and Orche both expressed fears for his safety. Shaftesbury had been taking legal action in relation to the theft of some family antiques and artwork. Some friends and acquaintances mentioned that he had complained of money problems, so they surmised that his disappearance may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the theft and financial loss.|$|E
25|$|Maclean also criticised Dalyell for reiterating the programme's unfounded {{claims that}} the British or American {{security}} services may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with Fletcher's death. He concluded by saying it was the Libyan nationals in the bureau who should be co-operating with the investigation into her murder.|$|E
25|$|These {{materials}} are evidence both of specialization {{of labor and}} commerce. The flint used came from southern Poland; the obsidian came from the Bükk and Tatra mountains. Settlements in those regions specialized in mining and manufacture. The products were exported {{to all the other}} LBK regions, which must <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> trade. This commerce is a strong argument for an ethnic unity between the scattered pockets of the culture.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I <b>have</b> made a {{very unfortunate}} mistake with regard to Thomson, Mr Merevale. A variety of reasons led {{me to think that}} he <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with this theft of the Sports prizes.' ...|$|R
60|$|And when Gerda was warmed and <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat and drink, the Lapland woman {{wrote on}} a dried stock-fish, and begged Gerda {{to take care}} of it, tied Gerda {{securely}} on the reindeer's back, and away they went again.|$|R
25|$|In 1972 the BBC {{terminated}} Bernard Braden's {{late night}} show, On the Braden Beat, {{replacing it with}} a similar programme, That's Life!, introduced by Esther Rantzen, who had worked with Braden. The reasons seem a little complicated and may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with Braden's contract to advertise margarine on ITV. However, although Braden himself was publicly circumspect about the decision, Kelly was forthright in condemning it and was plainly hostile towards Rantzen.|$|E
25|$|Harald II died in 1018, and Cnut went to Denmark {{to affirm}} his {{succession}} to the Danish crown as Cnut II, stating {{his intention to}} avert attacks against England in a letter in 1019 (see above). It seems there were Danes in opposition to him, and an attack he carried out on the Wends of Pomerania may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with this. In this expedition, {{at least one of}} Cnut's Englishmen, Godwin, apparently won the king's trust after a night-time raid he personally led against a Wendish encampment.|$|E
25|$|In 1805, while a {{territorial}} legislator, Floyd {{became involved}} in the plot of Aaron Burr. Floyd and Burr had both become members {{of the board of directors}} of the Indiana Canal Company. The company, believed to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the conspiracy, was to build a canal around the Falls of the Ohio on the Indiana side of the river. The company failed and the investors lost their money, which was believed to have been used to help finance Burr's plot. It was never proven that the money was stolen. The company had an initial investment of $120,000 and handled over one million dollars during its duration.|$|E
6000|$|... “Stupid old fool!” we mutter, “what’s he {{know about}} it?” And, if his portent proves correct, we come back feeling still more angry against him, and with a vague notion that, somehow or other, he <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, father," [...] Geoffrey said, {{touching}} the plasters on his head, [...] "this looks somewhat {{as if we}} <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the fighting, and here is a letter for you from Captain Vere which will give you some information about it." ...|$|R

25|$|Producing metric {{drawings}} and analyzing {{the materials used}} in the Derwent V went fairly quickly, but finding {{a substitute for the}} high-temperature, creep-resistant Nimonic 80 steel alloy was a more difficult challenge. Eventually an alloy that matched Nimonic 80's high-temperature properties was found in KhN 80T, but it was not creep-resistant. The first Derwent V copy, designated as the RD-500 (Reaktivnyy Dvigatel — jet engine) after the Factory No. 500 where the engine was first produced, was being tested on 31 December 1947, but problems cropped up quickly. Combustion was uneven and this cracked the combustion chambers. This may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the modifications made by the Soviets to the fuel, speed and starter systems. But these problems were resolved by September 1948 when the engine passed its 100-hour State acceptance test.|$|E
25|$|To date, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that Paulo Portas personally embezzled any funds from the submarines' purchase, and, since Portugal's 10-year statute of limitations for white collar crimes expired in 2014, he (or anyone else) can no longer be prosecuted even if incriminating evidence were to emerge some day. Still, the suspicions against Paulo Portas are unlikely to ever go away given the established facts that (i) he was the Minister in-charge at the time, which makes him the main figure in a controversial deal that, even if not tainted by his corruption, was disastrous for Portugal's finances; (ii) in contrast with his usual incisiveness on all other affairs of state, Paulo Portas has consistently been evasive about his role and any details of the submarines purchase; (iii) his CDS-PP party was shown to have been in close contact with one of the submarines' intermediaries (ESCOM) and to have received sizeable donations from fabricated sources shortly after (see Portucale case above); and (iv) Portas himself is on record saying he could not talk about the submarines deal on a cell phone for fear of being wiretapped, which suggests he might <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> hide.|$|E
500|$|Von Kressenstein's {{satisfaction}} that the garrison could withstand any assault may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{do with its}} remoteness. Magdhaba was about [...] from the British railhead and [...] from El Arish. There were two other important pieces of information von Kressenstein did not have. Firstly, {{he would have been}} unaware of the speed, flexibility and determination of the Australian, British and New Zealand mounted force, which they were about to demonstrate. Secondly, the arrival of the new British commander, Chetwode, and his staff and their vital forward planning to organise the necessary logistical support for an immediate long range attack by the Anzac Mounted Division.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{do with that}} bully, Gus Plum," [...] said Phil.

60|$|Mordaunt hesitated. He {{imagined}} Shanks <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do {{with the}} accident to Jim's car, and {{it was obvious that}} the fellow was bitterly revengeful. At the beginning, Mordaunt <b>had</b> not meant to work upon his vindictive feelings; he <b>had</b> done so half-consciously, but now he meant to go on.|$|R
60|$|He was tired, {{exhausted}} and hungry. He <b>had</b> walked a long way. And he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat--soon.|$|R
500|$|Stephen of Blois, a Crusade leader, was in Alexandretta when {{he learned}} of the {{situation}} in Antioch. It seemed like their situation was hopeless so he left the Middle East, warning Alexios and his army {{on his way back to}} France. Because of what looked like a massive betrayal, the leaders at Antioch, most notably Bohemond, argued that Alexios had deserted the Crusade and thus invalidated all of their oaths to him. While Bohemond asserted his claim to Antioch, not everyone agreed (most notably Raymond of Toulouse), so the crusade was delayed for the rest of the year while the nobles argued amongst themselves. When discussing this period, a common historiographical viewpoint advanced by some scholars is that the Franks of northern France, the Provençals of southern France, and the Normans of southern Italy considered themselves separate [...] "nations", creating turmoil as each tried to increase its individual status. Others argue that while this may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the disputes, personal ambition among the Crusader leaders might just be as easily blamed.|$|E
500|$|Conversion to Christianity enabled Disraeli to {{contemplate}} {{a career in}} politics. Britain in the early-nineteenth century was not a greatly anti-Semitic society, {{and there had been}} Members of Parliament (MPs) from Jewish families since Samson Gideon in 1770. But until 1858, MPs were required to take the oath of allegiance [...] "on the true faith of a Christian", necessitating at least nominal conversion. It is not known whether Disraeli formed any ambition for a parliamentary career {{at the time of his}} baptism, but there is no doubt that he bitterly regretted his parents' decision not to send him to Winchester College. As one of the great public schools of England, Winchester consistently provided recruits to the political elite. His two younger brothers were sent there, and it is not clear why Isaac D'Israeli chose to send his eldest son to a much less prestigious school. The boy evidently held his mother responsible for the decision; Bradford speculates that [...] "Benjamin's delicate health and his obviously Jewish appearance may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with it." [...] The school chosen for him was run by Eliezer Cogan at Higham Hill in Walthamstow. He began there in the autumn term of 1817; he later recalled his education: ...|$|E
500|$|Paul asks Mary Alice’s {{neighbors and}} friends, Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Bree (Marcia Cross) and Gabrielle (Eva Longoria), {{to go through}} her clothes and other {{belongings}} and then pack them up, as he thinks {{it will be too}} hard for him. The women end up finding a letter addressed to Mary Alice, a blackmail note reading, [...] "I know what you did, it makes me sick, I’m going to tell." [...] Thereafter, the women make a series of discoveries concerning Mary Alice’s past and her possible motives for ending her life; she was being treated by Dr. Albert Goldfine (Sam Lloyd) where she revealed that she once went by the name Angela, and she may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with a baby that went missing. [...] Paul soon discovers who sent Mary Alice the note, their next-door neighbor struggling with financial difficulty, Martha Huber (Christine Estabrook), whom he ends up strangling to death out of pure rage and burying her body in the nearby forest. Meanwhile, her son Zach begins having flashbacks and is under the impression he killed a baby named Dana, who he believed to be his younger sister and reveals this to Julie Mayer (Andrea Bowen), Susan’s daughter. Paul worries over what Susan is spreading about their family, so he tells Susan in private that Zach accidentally killed his younger sister, Dana, and that he and Mary Alice covered it up to protect him. However, it becomes evident {{that this is not the}} case when Paul tells Zach that Dana is still very much alive.|$|E
60|$|Besides, {{there was}} still another {{important}} factor in the case. I knew well enough that if the money was not recovered, there would be plenty of people mean enough to intimate that I <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with its disappearance. The Strong honor was considered low by many, and they would not hesitate to declare that I was only following in my father's footsteps.|$|R

But when the good lady <b>had</b> nearly finished, and was speaking of her resolution to confide everything to Mr. Perley, Edna's gaze at her friend became very intent, and her hands tightly grasped {{the arms of the}} chair in which she was sitting.|$|R

Educated at Saint Eunan's College in Letterkenny, he <b>has</b> been his county's number one goalkeeper in the past, though Paul Durcan <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say about that. Boyle <b>has</b> also played soccer for Finn Harps in the League of Ireland.|$|R
500|$|Neighbours {{was created}} in the early-to-mid-1980s by Australian TV {{executive}} Reg Watson. Watson decided to create a soap opera after working on Crossroads and seeing how successful it and Coronation Street were in Britain. He had already created such successful Australian made soap operas as The Young Doctors, Prisoner and Sons and Daughters. Watson proposed the idea of making a show that would focus on more realistic stories and portray teens and adults who talk openly to each other and solve their problems together. Watson, who worked for the Grundy production company, decided to make his show appeal to both Australia and Britain. In 2005, Darren Devlyn and Caroline Frost from the Herald Sun reported that Watson then took his idea to the Nine Network in 1982, but it was rejected. Former Network Nine chief executive Ian Johnson commented {{that it was one of}} the [...] "biggest missed opportunities" [...] in his twenty-four years at the network. He added [...] "I remember it being discussed, but I'm not exactly sure what went against it. It may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the fact we'd picked up Sale of the Century with Tony Barber in 1980 and it was doing huge business, so we didn't have a pressing need for a five-night-a-week show." [...] Watson then took his idea to the Seven Network, who commissioned the show, following the success of his other Seven Network soap opera, Sons and Daughters. Several titles for the show were discussed, including People Like Us, One Way Street, No Through Road and Living Together until the network programmers voted on Neighbours. The first episode was broadcast on 18 March 1985 and reviews for the show were favourable. However, the Melbourne-produced programme underperformed in the Sydney market and after a meeting of the general managers, Seven decided to drop the show in October 1985. Seven's Melbourne programme boss, Gary Fenton said Sydney chief Ted Thomas told the other general managers that Seven could not afford three dramas and argued that the Sydney-based A Country Practice and Sons and Daughters be retained.|$|E
2500|$|Kennedy was {{reassigned to}} a desk job in South Carolina in January 1942, and the {{relationship}} with Arvad ended after a few brief encounters. Kennedy later stated he thought Hoover might <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with his transfer. Kennedy and Arvad knew they were being followed, and in the FBI transcripts of their encounters they sometimes spoke to [...] "whoever is listening". In the end, Inga reflected on her time with Kennedy as a [...] "passing affair".|$|E
2500|$|Flight {{operations}} at Tonopah closed down in March 1988, although the 4477th was not inactivated until July 1990, {{according to one}} official Air Force history. In the interim, a handful of pilots flew 'continuation training (CT)' sorties at Groom Lake. [...] The decision to shut down operations may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the fact}} that a new generation of Soviet aircraft was entering service and also the inevitable round of budget cuts from Washington.|$|E
50|$|The police arrive {{too late}} to make any arrests, but Lieutenant Brannigan finds the absence of Sarah and the other Save a Soul members too {{convenient}} to <b>have</b> been a coincidence.

Sarah is equally suspicious that Sky <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with organizing the crap game at the Mission and she angrily takes her leave of him, refusing to accept his denials.|$|R
60|$|The {{man said}} he did not care about the anchor--he was just as God <b>had</b> made him (he looked as if his cook <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with it) and, sink or swim, he purposed embarking in that ship. A good deal of wrangling ensued, but one of the sailors finally threw the man a cork life-preserver, and the captain said that would lighten him and he might come abroad.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps {{this opinion}} {{may account for}} {{the fact that many of}} the miners-- {{especially}} the younger among them--returned again and again to Bevan's Gully to search for gold although the search was not remunerative. Among those persevering though unsuccessful diggers <b>had</b> been, for a considerable time past, our hero Tom Brixton.

2500|$|Kindlon's co-counsel {{and wife}} Laurie Shanks has also {{maintained}} that police overlooked {{the possibility that}} Peter Porco's death {{was the result of}} retaliation against his uncle Frank Porco, a captain in the Bonanno crime family in New York City. Frank Porco had served two years in prison for loansharking and extortion, although Shanks incorrectly told jurors that he had been indicted for his involvement in a murder. Shanks noted that Frank Porco's nickname with the mob was [...] "The Fireman", which could <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the type of murder weapon found, a fire ax. He had served in the New York City Fire Department.|$|E
2500|$|Nedim is now {{generally}} considered, {{along with}} Fuzûlî and Bâkî, {{to be one}} of the three greatest poets in the Ottoman Divan poetry tradition. It was not, however, until relatively recently that he came to be seen as such: in his own time, for instance, the title of reîs-i şâirân (رئيس شاعران), or [...] "president of poets", was given by Sultan Ahmed III not to Nedim, but to the now relatively obscure poet Osmanzâde Tâib, and several other poets as well were considered superior to Nedim in his own day. This relative lack of recognition may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the sheer newness of Nedim's work, much of which was rather radical for its time.|$|E
