500|$|Fire Station No. 23 is {{a former}} fire station in Downtown Los Angeles. [...] Built in 1910 as an {{operating}} fire station, {{it was also the}} Los Angeles Fire Department's headquarters until 1920 and the residence of every fire chief from 1910-1928. [...] When it opened, it spawned a political firestorm due to the ornate interior and expensive imported materials, leading to its being called the [...] "Taj Mahal" [...] of firehouses. [...] After 50 years of operation, the station was closed in 1960 as the department began replacing older stations with new facilities. [...] Since the 1980s, Fire Station No. 23 has been a popular filming location. [...] Motion pictures filmed at the station include the Ghostbusters movies, The Mask, Police Academy 2, <b>Flatliners,</b> Firehouse and National Security.|$|E
500|$|The {{first major}} motion picture filmed at Station 23 was Hammett (1982) by German {{director}} Wim Wenders, followed {{two years later}} by Ghostbusters. [...] The station {{was used in the}} 1984 production as the location for the interior scenes of the headquarters of Drs. Venkman, Stantz and Spengler and Winston Zeddemore. Another station in New York, the Hook & Ladder Company 8 firehouse, was used for the exterior shots. The success of Ghostbusters helped popularize the station as a shooting location, and Fire Station No. 23 has since then been used in more than 50 productions, including Big Trouble in Little China (1986), Ghostbusters II (1989), The Mask (1994), Police Academy 2 (1985), A-Team (1986) and V.I. Warshawski (1991), <b>Flatliners</b> (1991), Lost Highway (1997), National Security (2003), and RE(e)volution (2005).|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{representation}} of Klingon mythology garnered negative reviews from critics. TrekToday Michelle Erica Green responded positively to the performances by Dawson, Tim Russ, and Kate Mulgrew, but {{felt that the}} storyline bore too many similarities to those from earlier Star Trek installments and the 1990 film <b>Flatliners.</b> Hines, of the same publication, was disappointed {{by the absence of}} Fek'lhr, who had been introduced in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode [...] "", and wrote that the character could have been included as guarding the gates to Gre'thor through CGI. Hines was critical of the parallels between Miral and Janeway, believing certain sequences would have been more effective without Janeway present. Ranking it at number thirteen out of the twenty-two Star Trek episodes written by Fuller, Blastr's Dany Roth praised the writer's attempt to better address Torres as a character, but felt his approach to the afterlife and spirituality were too direct and literal. John Andrews of Den of Geek! responded positively to the episode's emphasis on Torres and Klingon mythology, but felt that it was [...] "still pretty hokey".|$|E

50|$|The {{main event}} of Part 2 saw Prince Puma (alone without Konnan) {{defending}} the Lucha Underground Championship against Mil Muertes (accompanied by Catrina). During the match, Catrina repeatedly lifted her magical stone, which helped Muertes recover. Puma scored 2 counts after a fireman's carry {{thrown into a}} kick and Northern Lights suplex into a deadlift suplex; then had to kick out at 2 himself after Muertes speared {{him out of the}} ring and through a table, then powerbombed him into the table remnants. Later, Puma hit a 630° senton for a nearfall; Muertes dodged another 630 attempt, then hit a spear and the <b>Flatliner</b> for a nearfall on Puma. No one had kicked out of the 630 or the <b>Flatliner</b> prior. When Puma ascended to the top rope again, Muertes met him there and hit a super <b>Flatliner,</b> leading to the pin, the win and the title. Muertes celebrated with Catrina and the Disciples of Deaths, wielding their respective championships and magical stone.|$|R
5|$|The second {{match was}} Scott Steiner versus Test {{in which the}} winner would earn the {{managing}} services of Stacy Keibler. In the early stages, both competitors wrestled inconclusively until Steiner performed a Belly to belly suplex on Test. Test attempted to hit Steiner with a chair but the chair hit Test. Steiner performed the Steiner <b>Flatliner</b> to win the match and Keibler's managing services.|$|R
500|$|Its imagery {{has been}} {{directly}} referenced in several works. The 2006 James Bond film, Casino Royale contains a small homage where James Bond pursues a female character through Venice, catching glimpses of {{her through the}} crowds wearing a red dress. The Bruges set thriller, In Bruges, starring Colin Farrell, includes a number of explicit references; director Martin McDonagh said that the [...] "Venice of Don't Look Now" [...] was the template for the depiction of Bruges in his film, and the film includes numerous thematic similarities, including one character stating that the film she is working on is a [...] "pastiche of Don't Look Now". <b>Flatliners,</b> a 1990 supernatural thriller directed by Joel Schumacher, also draws explicitly on the red-coated childlike figure by having a character terrorised by a child wearing a red coat; coincidentally, the character who is being tormented is played by Kiefer Sutherland, Donald Sutherland's son. [...] In the 2007 stage play of Don't Look Now, written by Nell Leyshon and directed by Lucy Bailey, the play made {{a conscious effort to}} bypass the film and be a faithful adaptation of du Maurier's short story, but it did however retain the iconic red mac from the film as worn by the elusive childlike figure.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1993, Batman Forever {{director}} Joel Schumacher {{had seen}} Tombstone and was most impressed with Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday. Schumacher felt {{him to be}} perfect {{for the role of}} Batman, though at the time, the role was still Michael Keaton's. In July 1994, Keaton decided not to return for a third Batman film after 1992's Batman Returns, due to [...] "creative differences". William Baldwin (who previously worked with Schumacher on <b>Flatliners)</b> was reported to be a top contender, though just days after Keaton dropped out, Kilmer was cast. Kilmer took the role without even knowing who the new director was and without reading the script.|$|E

50|$|Also {{known as}} the Complete Shot or <b>Flatliner,</b> this is a move in which a wrestler stands {{side-to-side}} and slightly behind with the opponent, facing in the opposite direction, and reaches around the opponent's torso with one arm across the opponent's chest with his/her hand holding on to his/her other hand which is behind the opponent's head. The wrestler then falls backward, driving the opponent into the mat face-first. The wrestler can also cross his/her leg between the opponent's leg before hitting the reverse STO, with this slight variation being known as a leg hook reverse STO, once used as a finisher by former WWE and TNA wrestler Ken Anderson {{known as the}} Mic Check. This move {{can be used to}} transition into various submissions. The move is commonly used to transition into the Code of Silence, a modified figure-four headscissor (utilized by Carmella) or a Koji Clutch.|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Matt Fowler of IGN wrote: [...] ""Bullseye" [...] wasn't bad at all, {{but it was}} sort of a <b>flatliner</b> when it came to providing thrills. The spinning wheel bit made for an interesting gambit, but it still seemed like it could have gone further. And while I like the prospect of Dot and Bette trying to separate themselves, their arc this week with Dandy felt a lot like filler. We'll have to see how everything shakes out with Dandy and Jimmy's pow wow." [...] Erik Adams of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A- rating, writing: [...] "When [...] "Bullseye" [...] drops a chainsaw, it loses a pinky toe at most. This is the episode that's been waiting to fight its way out of Freak Show all along, catalyzing the season's potential energy into the genuine spectacle of histrionic freakouts and hypnogogic fantasy." ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{genetic polymorphism}} in the Caenorhabditis elegans srh and str chemoreceptor gene families, {{each of which}} consists of ∼ 300 genes encoding seven-pass G-protein-coupled receptors. Almost one-third of the genes in each family are annotated as pseudogenes because of apparent functional defects in N 2, the sequenced wild-type strain of C. elegans. More than half of these “pseudogenes” have only one apparent defect, usually a stop codon or deletion. We sequenced the defective region for 31 such genes in 22 wild isolates of C. elegans. For 10 of the 31 genes, we found an apparently functional allele {{in one or more}} wild isolates, suggesting that these are not pseudogenes but instead functional genes with a defective allele in N 2. We suggest the term “flatliner” to describe genes whose functional vs. pseudogene status is unclear. Investigations of <b>flatliner</b> gene positions, dN/dS ratios, and phylogenetic trees indicate that they are not readily distinguished from functional genes in N 2. We also report striking heterogeneity in the frequency of other polymorphisms among these genes. Finally, the large majority of polymorphism was found in just two strains from geographically isolated islands, Hawaii and Madeira. This suggests that our sampling of wild diversity in C. elegans is narrow and that identification of additional strains from similarly isolated regions will greatly expand the diversity available for study...|$|R

50|$|The {{serialization}} {{begins in}} the Scottish Highlands in 188X, with Fury <b>Flatliner</b> and Wraith Allen getting revenge against the Frankenstein that killed their parents five years ago. Wraith is mortally wounded, Fury then attacks it but he and the monster are struck by lightning. He awakens {{in the home of}} Dr. Peaberry, who found him and gave him medical attention. When he arrives back at Lord Weiss's mansion, who took them in five years ago, Wraith is there waiting for him, now a Frankenstein himself. They learn from Dr. Peaberry that the largest production of Frankenstein's is in London, and decide to head there, Fury to destroy all of them and Wraith to learn about them. However, before leaving Wraith tells Fury that Lord Weiss is the one who turned him into a Frankenstein and that he adopted Edel as his daughter in hopes of turning her into a Frankenstein of his actual daughter. When Lord Weiss attempts to operate on Edel, Fury and Wraith stop him with the help of Dr. Peaberry. Wraith then kills Edel and it is revealed that Fury was turned into a Frankenstein by Dr. Peaberry. He attacks Wraith, but Wraith escapes with Weiss's notes and promises to meet in London. Dr. Peaberry informs Fury that she turned him into a monster with the specific purpose of having him kill all the others.|$|R
50|$|The final {{match on}} the undercard was Diamond Dallas Page versus Jeff Jarrett. However, Jarrett goaded Page into {{fighting}} Chris Kanyon into a match after a brawl between Page and Kanyon on that week's Nitro. Kanyon launched a sneak attack on Page from behind but Page soon countered Kanyon's offensive. Both men exchanged moves until Kanyon tried {{to win by}} delivering a Kanyon Kutter but got a near-fall. Kanyon called Jarrett to hit Page with an Acoustic Equalizer but Jarrett missed it and Page took advantage with a roll-up but Kanyon kicked out at 2. The referee was knocked out and Jarrett entered the ring to hit Page with a Stroke. Kanyon followed it with a <b>Flatliner</b> to win the match. After the match, Jarrett and Page began their match. Jarrett took advantage of Page's condition but Page managed to counter with a brawl at ringside. Page tried his Diamond Cutter on Jarrett on the announce table but Jarrett shoved him into Tony Schiavone. Jarrett controlled the match until Page made a comeback near the closing moments of the match. Kanyon returned to the ring to pull Page out of the ring, allowing Jarrett to nail Page with a chair shot and got a near-fall. Jarrett went for his Acoustic Equalizer on Page but he ducked and Kanyon was hit with it, allowing Page to deliver a Diamond Cutter to Jarrett to get the win.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of season two, Lucha Underground Temple owner Dario Cueto (Luis Fernandez-Gil) has been absent from the Temple {{since the end of}} season 1 and Catrina (Karlee Perez) has taken charge of the temple, leaving it a [...] "much darker place" [...] as Matt Striker comments during the opening scene. Under her management Lucha Underground Champion Mil Muertes (Gilbert Cosme) and Lucha Underground Trios Champions the Disciples of Death control the operation. In their quest to control everything Catrina hires King Cuerno to take the Gift of the Gods Championship from Fénix. Fénix defeated Mil Muertes to win the championship, only for Catrina to force him to defend the title during Aztec Warfare II. During the match Cueto returns to the temple, unleashing his brother Matanza on the temple, winning the Lucha Underground Championship in the process. Over the next few weeks, running alongside a tournament for the Lucha Underground Trios Championship, The Monster Matanza Cueto would go on to easily dispatch top technicos in the promotion like Pentagon Jr. and Fenix. Matanza's first real challenge {{came in the form of}} the former Lucha Underground Champion Mil Muertes. In their initial encounter, Mil Muertes delivered his finisher, the <b>flatliner,</b> to the Monster which sent both monsters through the roof of Dario Cueto's office. This put both monsters out of commission for several weeks and gave the crowd something that's rare in Lucha Underground, a no-contest finish.|$|R
