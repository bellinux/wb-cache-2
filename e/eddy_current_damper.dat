40|$|ABSTRACT—When a {{conductive}} {{material is}} subjected to a time-varying magnetic flux, <b>eddy</b> <b>currents</b> are generated in the conductor. These <b>eddy</b> <b>currents</b> circulate inside the conductor generating a magnetic field of opposite polarity as the applied magnetic field. The interaction of the two magnetic fields causes a force that resists the change in magnetic flux. However, due to the internal resistance of the conductive material, the <b>eddy</b> <b>currents</b> will be dissipated into heat and the force will die out. As the <b>eddy</b> <b>currents</b> are dissipated, energy {{is removed from the}} system, thus producing a damping effect. There are several different methods of inducing a time-varying magnetic field, and from each method arises the potential for a different type of damping system. Therefore, the research into <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> and magnetic <b>damping</b> mechanisms has led to a diverse range of dampers, many of which are detailed in this paper. The majority of the research in <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>damping</b> has taken place in the area of magnetic braking.

In the <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>damper</b> a finite rectangular conducting plate is moving between cuboidal magnets.

The assumption of an infinite conducting plate gives less than 15 % error for a conducting plate with at least twice the dimensions of the permanent magnet. Applying the method of images reduces the modeling error for a conducting plate with two times the permanent magnet dimensions to less than 3 % in respect to a finite element model.

The vertical orientation of the thruster dictates that the thruster must be horizontally offset from the pendulum pivot arm, necessitating {{the use of a}} counterweight system to provide a neutrally-stable system. Motion of the pendulum arm is transferred through a balance mechanism to a secondary arm on which deflection is measured. A non-contact light-based transducer is used to measure displacement of the secondary beam. The members experience very little friction, rotating on twisting torsional pivots with oscillatory motion attenuated by a passive, <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>damper.</b> Displacement is calibrated using an in situ thrust calibration system.

The final version is available from Springer via the DOI in this recordConference Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Mechanics Series book series (CPSEMS) Eddy current damping has been extensively developed {{in recent years and}} is widely used in the mechanical engineering sector, for example, in railway and turbine braking systems as well as in car vibration control systems. Vibration control approaches for civil engineering structures still usually rely on more traditional approaches, such as viscous and tuned mass dampers. The use of novel Eddy current damping devices has the potential to complement these traditional approaches and is the focus of the work presented here. The <b>Eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>damper</b> (ECD), which is a kind of electromagnetic induction damper, comprises a permanent magnet, a conductor and framing components. In this study, an ECD is developed and investigated to provide an alternative to viscous dampers that often exhibit undesirable non-linear characteristics arising from friction. Since the moving components of an ECD are not in contact, the influence of friction is negligible. A finite element model is initially used to evaluate the ECD damping properties and employed on a footbridge structure. The finite element and analytical results demonstrate satisfactory augmentation of damping effect under both random and harmonic signal input.

Therefore, {{it is desirable}} to find a feasible and effective device to suppress the subsea vibration. Eddy current tuned mass damper (ECTMD), which employs the damping force generated by the relative movement of a non-magnetic conductive metal (such as copper or aluminum) through a magnetic field, is demonstrated to be an efficient way in structural vibration control. However, the feasibility and effectiveness of ECTMD in a seawater environment has not been reported on before.

Due to launch vehicle mass and volume constraints, these mirrors have to be deployable and lightweight, such as segmented mirrors using active optics to correct mirror surfaces with closed loop control. As a part of this work, system identification tests revealed that dynamic disturbances inheret in a laboratory environment are significant enough to degrade the optical performance of the telescope. Research was performed at the Naval Postgraduate School to identify the vibration modes most affecting the optical performance and evaluate different techniques to increase damping of those modes. Based on this work, tuned mass dampers (TMDs) were selected becaues of their simplicity in implementation and effectiveness in targeting specific modes. The selected damping mechanism was an <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>damper</b> where the damping and frequency of the damper could be easily changed. System identification of segments was performed to derive TMD specifications. Several configurations of the damper were evaluated, including the number and placement of TMDs, damping constant, and targeted structural modes. The final configuration consisted of two dampers located at the edge of each segment and resulted in the 80 % reduction in vibrations. The WFE for the system without dampers was 1. 5 waves, with one TMD and the WFE was 0. 9 waves, and the two TMDs and the WFE was 0. 25 waves.

At 4. 2 °K the thin films showed no observable <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>damping,</b> while the indium strips showed damping which increased with the magnetic field intensity. At temperatures corresponding to critical fields of about 50 gauss both materials showed damping which increased with the magnetic field intensity.

30|$|However, {{in order}} to keep the {{required}} sampling time for the averaging short, the probe is equipped with a damping mechanism. Figure  3 b shows the essential parts of the <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>damping</b> unit. A pair of small cylindrical permanent magnets provides a magnetic field that penetrates a thin copper sheet attached to the back side of the target holder. The target together with the copper sheet oscillates perpendicularly to the field lines, so that <b>eddy</b> <b>currents</b> are generated in the sheet. The currents create a counteracting force (Lenz’s law) and dissipate energy stemming from the oscillation. Figure  3 a shows the x-y plot of the measured displacements for the damped case (blue curve), too. Now, the oscillations are significantly reduced in both directions. The natural frequency f 0 disappeared completely from the spectra shown in Fig.  3 d, which indicates the efficient damping of the cantilever vibrations. In contrast, the amplitudes at other frequencies persist; the remaining frequencies can be understood as the complicated modes of the entire setup that result not only in vibrations of the lenses but also of the damping unit, which are unintentionally transmitted to the target via the <b>eddy</b> <b>currents.</b> We determined the time constants τ for the exponentially decaying amplitudes, i.e. decaying proportionally to exp(−t/τ) with the time t. To this end, we knocked carefully on the target with a thin wire and recorded the oscillations. We found τ=(6.0 ± 0.5) s without <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>damping,</b> and τ′=(0.3 ± 0.1) s with the damping unit. The resulting quality factor Q = 1 / 2 ω _ 0 τ for the cantilever as an oscillating system becomes Q= 209 ± 18 without additional damping and Q′= 10.5 ± 3.5 for the intentionally damped system. This means that the damped cantilever looses its oscillation energy after only a few (≈Q′ / 2 π) oscillations, but it is still underdamped (Q′> 1 / 2), i.e. abrupt displacements cause an overshooting. Inthe “Example of a vectorial force measurement” section, a measurement without damping will be shown in comparison with a corresponding measurement with the damping system.|$|R
