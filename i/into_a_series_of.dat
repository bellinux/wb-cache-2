5|$|Around 1450 BC, Greece {{was divided}} <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> warrior kingdoms, the most {{important}} being centered in Mycenae, Tiryns, Pylos and Thebes. Before {{the end of the}} same century, this militaristic civilization replaced the former priestess-dominated civilization of Minoan Cretans in the Aegean. Thus, the Mycenaeans began to build up their maritime power in the Aegean Sea, expanding towards the Aegean Islands and Anatolian coast. The warlike nature of the Mycenaeans was probably a decisive factor in their diplomatic relations towards the other Late Bronze Age powers. Mycenaean warriors were also hired as mercenaries in foreign armies, such as in Egypt.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} 19thcentury, the Oregon Trail, a pioneer trail {{of which a}} major portion {{followed}} the Snake River, had been established by aspiring settlers and traders. Steamboats and railroads moved agricultural products and minerals along the river throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. The powerful, steep flow of the Snake River has been used since the 1890s to generate hydroelectricity, enhance navigation, and provide irrigation water from fifteen major dams built on the lower river, transforming it <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> reservoirs. Several of these have been proposed for removal in order to restore some of the river's once-tremendous salmon runs.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarian sexual {{reproduction}} often involves a complex life cycle with both polyp and medusa stages. For example, in Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box jellies) a larva swims until it finds a good site, and then becomes a polyp. This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> disks that become juvenile medusae, {{a process called}} strobilation. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the polyp re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adults have gonads in the gastroderm, and these release ova and sperm into {{the water in the}} breeding season.|$|E
5|$|During {{the threat}} display, any sudden {{movement}} by the intruder may provoke the mamba <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> rapid strikes leading to severe envenomation. Also, {{the size of}} the black mamba, plus its ability to raise its head well off the ground, enable it to launch as much as 40% of its body length upwards, so mamba bites in humans quite often are on the upper body. This behaviour also permits the snake to land a strike at unexpectedly long range. The black mamba's reputed readiness to attack is often much exaggerated and usually is provoked by perceived threats, such as blocking its intended retreat, accidentally or otherwise.|$|E
