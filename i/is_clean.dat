5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the common house martin is open country with low vegetation, such as pasture, meadows and farmland, and preferably near water, although it {{is also found in}} mountains up to at least 2,200metres (7,200ft) altitude. As its name implies, it readily nests on man-made buildings, and will breed even in city centres if the air <b>is</b> <b>clean</b> enough. The other two species favour mountainous country (and sea cliffs in the case of Asian house martin); they use buildings as nest sites less frequently than their northern relative. The wintering grounds of the two migrant species include a range of open country and hilly habitats.|$|E

Tanya's daughter, Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), wants Rainie {{to stay and}} Max agrees. She steals money out of Max's sister Carol Jackson's (Lindsey Coulson) purse, which she uses to buy crack cocaine. Max catches her with the drugs and throws her out. She starts looking for her drugs where a drunken Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) approaches, finds Rainie's crack cocaine and is tempted to try some after she says it helps her block out her memories. Phil and Rainie get high at Phil's home. Rainie goes to get more drugs when Phil steals money from The Queen Victoria public house, but is mugged by a drug dealer. Phil's girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) offers {{to help him get}} clean but throws Rainie out of the house, calling her pathetic.|$|E

25|$|The {{product of}} the unit, the alkylate, is {{composed}} of a mixture of high-octane, branched-chain paraffinic hydrocarbons (mostly isoheptane and isooctane). Alkylate is a premium gasoline blending stock because it has exceptional antiknock properties and <b>is</b> <b>clean</b> burning. The octane number of the alkylate depends mainly upon the kind of alkenes used and upon operating conditions. For example, isooctane results from combining butylene with isobutane and has an octane rating of 100 by definition. There are other products in the alkylate effluent, however, so the octane rating will vary accordingly.|$|E

25|$|In {{reciting the}} Scout Oath, Scouts promise {{to do their}} duty to God and to be morally straight; the Scout Law holds that a Scout <b>is</b> <b>clean</b> and reverent. As early as 1978, the Boy Scouts of America {{circulated}} a memorandum among national executive staff stating {{that it was not}} appropriate for homosexuals to hold leadership positions in BSA. Similarly, since at least 1985, the BSA has interpreted the Scout Oath and Law as being incompatible with agnosticism and atheism. In both instances, the organization asserted {{that it was not a}} new policy to oppose and disfavor atheism, agnosticism and homosexuality, but rather, it was just enforcing long-held policies which had never been published or publicly challenged.|$|E

In many gasification processes most of the inorganic components of the input material, such as metals and minerals, are retained in the ash. In some gasification processes (slagging gasification) this ash has the form of a glassy solid with low leaching properties, but the net power production in slagging gasification is low (sometimes negative) and costs are higher.|$|E
25|$|Lake Nockamixon is an {{artificial}} reservoir formed by a dam on Tohickon Creek {{and serves as}} the centerpiece of Nockamixon State Park.

The water <b>is</b> <b>clean</b> and blue and has a very faint current, since the lake is part of the course of Tohickon Creek, which feeds in midway along the northwestern edge of the lake and discharges at the dam at the southeast corner. Lake Nockamixon is also fed by two other creeks known as Haycock Run, which feeds in at the northernmost point, and Three Mile Run, which feeds in at the southernmost point.|$|E

25|$|In the Orthodox Jewish community, {{women may}} test whether {{menstruation}} has ceased; this ritual {{is known as}} the hefsek taharah. The woman takes a bath or shower near sunset, wraps a special cloth around her finger, and swipes the vaginal circumference. If the cloth shows only discharges that are white, yellow, or clear, then menstruation is considered to have ceased. If discharge is red or pink, it indicates that menstruation continues. If it is any other color, like brown, it is subject to further inquiry, often involving consultation with a rabbi. The ritual requires that the cloth used to perform this test is first checked carefully to ensure that it <b>is</b> <b>clean</b> of any marks, colored threads, or specks; the cloth itself can be any clean white cloth, although there are small cloths designed for this ritual, known as bedikah cloths (meaning checking).|$|E
25|$|While many {{renewable}} energy projects are large-scale, renewable technologies are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries, where energy is often crucial in human development. Former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon {{has said that}} {{renewable energy}} {{has the ability to}} lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity. As most of renewables provide electricity, renewable energy deployment is often applied in conjunction with further electrification, which has several benefits: Electricity can be converted to heat (where necessary generating higher temperatures than fossil fuels), can be converted into mechanical energy with high efficiency and <b>is</b> <b>clean</b> at the point of consumption. In addition to that electrification with renewable energy is much more efficient and therefore leads to a significant reduction in primary energy requirements, because most renewables don't have a steam cycle with high losses (fossil power plants usually have losses of 40 to 65%).|$|E

Children disappear into the house and are later found brutally murdered. The Vivians and Penrod are sent to investigate and discover that the murders are the work of evil ghosts. The girls go about exorcising the place, but have to resort to arranging for a full-scale Holy Mass to be held in each room before the house <b>is</b> <b>clean.</b> They do this repeatedly, but it never works. The narrative ends mid-scene, with Darger having just been rescued from the Crazy House.|$|E
