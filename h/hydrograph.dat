40|$|A hybrid {{computer}} program is developed {{to simulate the}} outflow <b>hydrographs</b> of two urban watersheds located within Salt Lake County, Utah. The gaged outflow of the watersheds provided a checkpoint for comparing the observed and the simulated final outflow <b>hydrographs.</b> The outflow <b>hydrographs</b> for each subzone of the two watersheds were obtained by abstracting interception, infiltration and depression storage from each subzone hyetograph. The outflow of the subzones were routed to the Jordan River, the final outflow point of the two watersheds. The final <b>hydrographs</b> of the watersheds were combined and compared with the gaged flow. The uniquenesses of this systems model are the flexibility in varying hyetographs, variable loss rates, combination of subzone <b>hydrographs,</b> and the combination of watershed <b>hydrographs.</b> Subzone <b>hydrographs</b> can also be plotted for visual inspection as well as obtaining numerical values. With a variety of input and output data, designers and planners can visually perceive urban runoff characteristics. The systems model should be a tool used by those interested in urban runoff characteristics...|$|R

25|$|Flash floods are {{the most}} common flood type in normally-dry {{channels}} in arid zones, known as arroyos in the southwest United States and many other names elsewhere. In that setting, the first flood water to arrive is depleted as it wets the sandy stream bed. The leading edge of the flood thus advances more slowly than later and higher flows. As a result, the rising limb of the <b>hydrograph</b> becomes ever quicker as the flood moves downstream, until the flow rate is so great that the depletion by wetting soil becomes insignificant.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hydrographs</b> of ephemeral {{streams in}} an arid region usually {{decrease}} significantly in magnitude, downstream I {{unless they are}} augmented by tributary flows. Estimation of outflow <b>hydrographs</b> from a channel reach {{is essential for the}} development of water-resources systems. A hydrologic-flow-routing technique for arid ephemeral channels is developed. The hydrologic-routing equations for the movement of flood waves are modified by the inclusion of a nonlinear volumetric transmission loss rate term, which is empirically estimated from the observed inflow-outflow data for a channel reach. The predicted outflow <b>hydrographs</b> match better with the observed than the outflow <b>hydrographs</b> generated through the lumped regression model for ephemeral channels. The hydrologic-flow-routing technique may also be used for ungaged channel reaches through parameterization...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of flood peaks, corresponding volumes and <b>hydrographs</b> {{are required to}} design safe and cost-effective hydraulic structures. In this paper, we propose a statistical approach for the estimation of the design variables peak and volume by constructing synthetic design <b>hydrographs</b> for different flood types such as flash-floods, short-rain floods, long-rain floods, and rain-on-snow floods. Our approach relies on the fitting of probability density functions to observed flood <b>hydrographs</b> of a certain flood type and accounts for the dependence between peak discharge and flood volume. It makes use of the statistical information contained in the data and retains the process information of the flood type. The method was tested {{based on data from}} 39 meso-scale catchments in Switzerland and provides catchment specific and flood type specific synthetic design <b>hydrographs</b> for all of these catchments. We demonstrate that flood type specific synthetic design <b>hydrographs</b> are meaningful in flood risk management when combined with knowledge on the seasonality and the frequency of different flood types...|$|R
25|$|Physical process {{models of}} {{complete}} drainage basins {{are even more}} complex. Although many processes are well understood at a point or for a small area, others are poorly understood at all scales, and process interactions under normal or extreme climatic conditions may be unknown. Basin models typically combine land-surface process components (to estimate how much rainfall or snowmelt reaches a channel) {{with a series of}} reach models. For example, a basin model can calculate the runoff <b>hydrograph</b> that might result from a 100-year storm, although the recurrence interval of a storm is rarely equal to that of the associated flood. Basin models are commonly used in flood forecasting and warning, as well as in analysis of the effects of land use change and climate change.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the process}} of {{separating}} “baseflow” from “direct runoff” is an inexact science. [...] In part this is because these two concepts are not, themselves, entirely distinct and unrelated.

[...] Therefore, separation of a purely “baseflow component” in a <b>hydrograph</b> is a somewhat arbitrary exercise. [...] Nevertheless, various graphical and empirical techniques have been developed to perform these <b>hydrograph</b> separations.

2500|$|The UH {{technique}} {{provides a}} practical and relatively easy-to-apply tool for quantifying {{the effect of}} a unit of rainfall on the corresponding runoff from a particular drainage basin.

[...] In the real world, none of these assumptions are strictly true. [...] Nevertheless, application of UH methods typically yields a reasonable approximation of the flood response of natural watersheds. [...] The linear assumptions underlying UH theory allows for the variation in storm intensity over time (i.e., the storm hyetograph) to be simulated by applying the principles of superposition and proportionality to separate storm components to determine the resulting cumulative <b>hydrograph.</b> [...] This allows for a relatively straightforward calculation of the <b>hydrograph</b> response to any arbitrary rain event.|$|E

This paper illustrates how chemical <b>hydrographs</b> were used in a study of nitrates in the groundwater of the Fresno-Clovis metropolitan area (F. C. M. A.) of semiarid central California. The area comprises about 145 square miles, with a population of 310, 000. Urban water use is entirely derived from wells, whereas the surrounding agriculture relies on surface and ground water. In 1965, the California department of water resources noted nitrate concentrations in the F. C. M. A. were exceeding the safe limit. A number of sources of error in chemical analyses of water quality are noted. A measure of the accuracies of analyses and a method of double-checking anomalous results is furnished by plotting chemical <b>hydrographs</b> of individual wells. Seasonal changes in nitrate were consistent for many parts of the area, and were related to hydrogeologic factors and parameters directly affecting nitrification. Nitrate <b>hydrographs</b> were monitored by chloride <b>hydrographs.</b> The highest nitrate concentrations were in the shallower parts of the aquifer, and well deepening and changes in water level, pumping patterns and recharge rates complicated interpretations.
