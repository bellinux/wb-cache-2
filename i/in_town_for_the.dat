500|$|Munro {{moved from}} Mississauga to Toronto after high school, to attend OCAD University. From {{early on in}} his career, his {{signature}} medium was pastiche work with men's underwear. The origins of this work date back to his Intro to Sculpture class at OCAD, where his professor asked the students to [...] "bring a special object to class that isn't really functional, but is special to you." [...] Munro had long had an affinity for special underwear, ever since his mother had refused to buy him Underoos superhero underwear {{when he was a}} child; regarding white briefs, he said, [...] "They were clinical and sterile. They weren't very sexy. It just felt very repressed. I wanted Underoos so bad." [...] For the sculpture class, Munro decided to bring in a pair of underwear that he had stolen from a high school friend on whom he had a crush. He put the grey underwear on display in a Plexiglass cage, complete with air holes. In his subsequent work he decided to use white briefs as a medium [...] "because they were so accessible." [...] The summer after his sculpture class, to keep himself busy on a road trip, he made a quilt out of white underwear. In 1997, his first show involving underwear was held in a gallery supported by his college. The show received publicity after conservative columnist Michael Coren, in the Toronto Sun and on the radio, criticized Munro and his show, in particular for having said that it involved [...] "boys' underwear" [...] (although Munro had simply meant guys' underwear). Coren asked the public to bring dirty diapers to the exhibit, but no one did. Munro went on to have many showings of his underwear art, mostly [...] "rescued" [...] from second-hand Goodwill clothing outlets, including at Who's Emma, HEADspace, and Paul Petro Contemporary Art.
