As Hecht relates it in Child of the Century, he didn't feel particularly Jewish in his daily life until Bergson shook {{him out of his}} assimilated complacency: Bergson invited Hecht to ask three close friends whether, in their opinion, Hecht was an American or a Jew.

Yankem revealed to Lawler <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a professional wrestler. This began a storyline of Lawler attempting to avenge his loss to Hart. Over the following weeks, more vignettes from Yankem's office aired. They showed him treating his patients, while Lawler asked them which wrestlers they liked and disliked. On the July 24 Raw, Hart beat Hakushi. After the bout, Hart assaulted and piledrove Hakushi's manager, Shinja.

25|$|The {{competition}} between Holly and Sebastian {{for the center}} ring develops into a romantic triangle as well, with both Sebastian and Brad vying for Holly as the aerialists' acts become increasingly daring and dangerous. Sebastian ignores his former lovers on the show: Angel, who performs in the elephant act; and Phyllis, who does a double turn as an iron jaw artist and a vocalist, starring in a South Seas spectacular built around her talent as a singer. The duel ends when, {{in response to a}} challenge from Holly, Sebastian removes his safety net and suffers serious injuries in a fall when a trick goes wrong. Buttons tends to him; and when the show's doctor expresses admiration for the way he dealt with the injuries, the clown explains, a little nervously, that <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a pharmacist's mate. Holly finally has the center ring and star billing – but not the way she wanted it. Brad is unable to comfort her because she is in love with Sebastian.|$|E
25|$|The 1924–25 {{school year}} was a hard period of work for Bourguiba. However, <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{interested}} in politics and French culture that {{he was eager to}} discover in every aspect. He frequently went to Palais Bourbon where he attended debates and sensitized to the intellectual and sentimental spirit of Leon Blum, that he already knew from Le Populaire. He also closely followed the evolution of French politics during the Third Republic. It was while discovering this new knowledge that he developed an interest for politics. Between classes, students went to Jardin du Luxembourg to talk about news and political issues, during the France between two wars. Bourguiba went to read his newspaper and participate in the debates. In that context of post-war, the main topics were Woodrow Wilson's self-determination doctrine and the Russian Revolution of 1917, but also the Congress of Tours that divided the SFIO. Furthermore, 1924 discussions were about Vladimir Lenin's death but also socialism and the rivalry between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky. Bourguiba was following the international news in detail, was opposed to Bolsheviks and got interested in Gandhi's idea of transforming the National Indian Congress into a powerful mass organization. He also thought that Hô Chi Minh's participation in Tours Congress and his joining of the Communist International, aiming to get his country independence {{with the help of the}} enemies of Imperialism and Capitalism, made him dependent of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics (USSR). Bourguiba also admired his Tunisian fellow Mahmoud El Materi, who was active in Paris.|$|E

Richardson complimented all instrumental performers, as well as producer Hans Wendl, for recording the ensemble with [...] "striking clarity", and called Shankar's playing [...] "timeless".

But you can be quite funny when you're feeling everything's pointless. He does some things that are so cruel and cold that they're actually quite funny." [...] While the character had once been known for his brash taste in bright, flamboyant shirts, The Sun noted that Abra's return saw him a [...] "shadow of his former self", wearing far less colourful apparel as a reflection of his more subdued state of mind. [...] Edmondson agreed that Abra's new wardrobe of shirts [...] "aren't quite as bright and dazzling - but that suits his current mood." ...|$|E
500|$|In any case, Biden {{would not}} run {{again for the}} {{presidency}} until his 2008 campaign, twenty years later. This time {{he made it to}} the Iowa caucuses, but withdrew after a poor showing. [...] Meanwhile, Biden and Kinnock had become close friends after the plagiarism incident. Meeting in August 2008, after Biden had been chosen by Democratic nominee Barack Obama as his running mate, Biden introduced Kinnock to his Senate staff by saying: “Hey, you people! Do you know this guy? <b>He</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> my greatest speechwriter.” [...] Obama and Biden proceeded to win the general election against the Republican ticket of John McCain and Sarah Palin; Biden's 1988 campaign lapses were never a significant issue in the race, and Biden invited Kinnock to the inauguration. Additionally, Biden also won the Delaware Senate election the same year, and would've been the longest serving Senator in Delaware history, had the McCain/Palin ticket been elected. In 2015, Biden considered a possible 2016 presidential bid, but declined it on October 21, 2015, the same year his son Beau died of brain cancer. As his term expired in 2017, he is currently considering a possible presidential bid for the 2020 election.|$|E
