In total, the series received 475 awards out of 800 nominations, thus making the films the most awarded film series in cinematic history.|$|E

25|$|There {{was a brief}} {{flowering}} of English progressive folk in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with groups like the Third Ear Band and Quintessence following the eastern Indian musical and more abstract work by group such as Comus, Dando Shaft, The Trees, Spirogyra, Forest, and Jan Dukes De Grey, but commercial success was elusive for these bands and most had broken up or moved in very different directions by about 1973. Perhaps the finest <b>individual</b> <b>work</b> in the genre was from artists early 1970s artists like Nick Drake and John Martyn, but these {{can also be considered}} the first among the English ‘folk troubadours’ or ‘singer-songwriters’, individual performers who remained largely acoustic but who relied mostly on their own individual compositions. The most successful of these was Ralph McTell, whose ‘Streets of London’ reached number 2 in the UK Single Charts in 1974, and whose music is clearly folk, but without much reliance on tradition, virtuosity, or much evidence of attempts at fusion with other genres.|$|E
25|$|Since its {{inception}} the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating {{the promotion of}} female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, {{in which they could}} become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979, there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In the modern Bahá'í community of New Zealand the Bahá'ís have multiplied their interests internally and externally. Aside from major themes there have also been <b>individual</b> <b>work</b> done in variety of topics - for example post-traumatic stress syndrome. Additionally the community has continued to advocate with the New Zealand government to speak up on behalf of the persecuted Bahá'ís in Iran.|$|E

500|$|The book {{sets forth}} several {{original}} theories, {{which can be}} applied to the practices of filmmaking, the arts, and beyond. Of these the theory of literature as [...] "humanics" [...] and the [...] "seed theory" [...] are the most important ones. Humanics centers on the question of a good and worthy life. In art, it emphasizes truly independent individuals who are capable of transforming society. The seed theory has become essential to North Korean film theory. It seeks to direct all artistic creation through a single ideological foundation, or [...] "seed". In an <b>individual</b> <b>work,</b> the seed is the synthesis of its subject matter and idea and the basis of its propaganda message. These ideas complement the themes of nationalistic form and socialist content of films. Many ideas presented in the book are justifications for the creation of propaganda supporting the Workers' Party of Korea's policies.|$|E
500|$|In his {{overview}} of Bax's earlier chamber works, Evans identifies {{as among the}} most successful the Phantasy for viola, the Trio for piano, violin, and viola and [...] "a String Quintet of such difficulty that an adequate performance has seldom if ever been possible". He rates the Second Violin Sonata (1915) as the composer's most <b>individual</b> <b>work</b> to that date. For Evans, the culminating point of Bax's early chamber music was the Piano Quintet, a work [...] "of such richness of invention {{that it would be}} an ornament to the musical literature of any country or period". [...] Foreman makes particular mention of the First String Quartet (1918 – [...] "a classical clarity of texture and form to its Celtic inspiration", and the [...] "grittier" [...] Second Quartet (1925), the Viola Sonata (1922), the Phantasy Sonata for viola and harp (1927) and the Sonata for Flute and Harp (1928).|$|E
500|$|A {{major theme}} of [...] "Box Cutter", {{and the entire}} fourth season, {{involved}} Walter's gradual change into a darker character who becomes more proactively violent and dangerous. The episode also illustrates Jesse's moral decline and feelings of guilt over his killing of Gale, and Skyler's growing involvement in Walter's illegal activities. The episode received positive reviews, and was watched by 2.58 million households, according to Nielsen Media Research. Until the fifth-season premiere, [...] "Box Cutter" [...] was the most watched Breaking Bad episode in the series' history and the third-highest-rated season premiere for any AMC show, after the first two seasons' premieres of The Walking Dead.

500|$|Starting {{with the}} 2003 awards, the Dramatic Presentation award was {{split into two}} categories: Best Dramatic Presentation (Long Form) and Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form). The Long Form award is for [...] "a dramatized {{production}} in any medium, including film, television, radio, live theater, computer games or music. The work must last 90 minutes or longer (excluding commercials)" [...] in the official Hugo Award rules. [...] The Short Form award is for [...] "a dramatized production in any medium, including film, television, radio, live theater, computer games or music. The work must last less than 90 minutes (excluding commercials)" [...] in the official Hugo Award rules. An <b>individual</b> <b>work</b> such as a television show can be nominated for a season in the Long Form category or for individual episodes in the Short Form, though not for both in the same year; as of 2017, a single show is additionally limited to two nominations in the Short Form category per year.|$|E
500|$|Comics and {{cartoons}} are literary genres {{that use}} drawings or graphics, usually {{in combination with}} text, to convey an entertaining narrative. Many contemporary comics have elements of fantasy and are produced by companies {{that are part of}} the entertainment industry. Others have unique authors who offer a more personal, philosophical view of the world and the problems people face. Comics about superheroes such as Superman are of the first type. Examples of the second sort include the <b>individual</b> <b>work</b> over 50 years [...] of Charles M. Schulz who produced a popular comic called Peanuts about the relationships among a cast of child characters; and Michael Leunig who entertains by producing whimsical cartoons that also incorporate social criticism. The Japanese Manga style differs from the western approach in that it encompasses a wide range of genres and themes for a readership of all ages. Caricature uses a kind of graphic entertainment for purposes ranging from merely putting a smile on the viewer's face, to raising social awareness, to highlighting the moral characteristics of a person being caricatured.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} before the First World War, Holst {{composed}} {{in a variety of}} genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most <b>individual</b> <b>work</b> to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as [...] "the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which he experimented with plainsong; the same year saw the enduringly popular St Paul's Suite (a [...] "gay but retrogressive" [...] piece according to Dickinson), and the failure of his large scale orchestral work Phantastes.|$|E
