25|$|Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a toxic {{chemical}} compound present in commercially available tin can plastic linings {{and transferred to}} canned food.

The longer food is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>can,</b> and the warmer and more acidic it is, the more BPA leaches into it. In September 2010, Canada became the first country to declare BPA a toxic substance. In the European Union and Canada, BPA use is banned in baby bottles.|$|E

25|$|The {{main product}} is Guinness Draught, a 4.2% ABV dry stout {{that is one}} of the most {{successful}} beer brands worldwide. For many years a portion of the drink was aged to give a sharp lactic flavour, although Guinness has refused to confirm whether this still occurs. The thick creamy head is the result of the beer being mixed with nitrogen when being poured. It is popular with Irish people both in Ireland and abroad and, in spite of a decline in consumption over recent years, is the best-selling alcoholic drink of all time in Ireland where Guinness & Co. makes almost €2billion annually. The brewery also produces Guinness Original, a 4.3% ABV version of the Draught, without the nitrogen; Kaliber, a low alcohol pale lager; Guinness Bitter, a 4.4% bitter sold <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>can</b> with a widget; and the 7.5% Guinness Foreign Extra Stout.|$|E
25|$|The {{direction}} of magnetization of the wedges <b>in</b> (<b>A)</b> <b>can</b> be calculated using {{a set of rules}} given by Abele and allows for great freedom {{in the shape of the}} cavity. Another class of design is the magnetic mangle (B), proposed by Coey and Cugat, in which uniformly magnetized rods are arranged such that their magnetization matches that of a Halbach cylinder, as shown for a 6-rod design. This design greatly increases access to the region of uniform field, at the expense of the volume of uniform field being smaller than in the cylindrical designs (although this area can be made larger by increasing the number of component rods). Rotating the rods relative to each other results in many possibilities including a dynamically variable field and various dipolar configurations. It can be seen that the designs shown in (A) and (B) are closely related to the k=2 Halbach cylinder. Other very simple designs for a uniform field include separated magnets with soft iron return paths, as shown in figure (C).|$|E
25|$|The machines, {{known as}} boxes, {{in the drawing}} section reduce the combed tops from thick slivers to thinner roving ready for spinning. This is done by {{drafting}} them between slow back rollers to faster front rollers, and controlling the fibres between these rollers. The first boxes where the ends are thickest are the double head can gill box (where the wool ends up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>can)</b> and the 2-spindle gill box (where the wool ends up twisted and on spindles). On these machines the rollers are heavily fluted to control the sliver, and the front rollers padded with leather to cushion the wool. Between {{the front and back}} rollers are fallers or bars which control the roving by holding it with fine pins. The roving is now called slubbing which needs twist for strength, and is dealt with by a second set of boxes: a 2-spindle draw-box, 4-spindle weigh box, 8-spindle finisher/reducer and 8-spindle rover. In these boxes the principle of two sets of rollers with controlled fibre in between is the same, but the yarn is now twisted onto a bobbin via a flyer.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the filming}} used a single, fixed, Arri 535B camera, {{with almost no}} {{handheld}} usage, and few cuts. Tracking shots relied on a track-mounted dolly, rather than Steadicam, to create calm, predictable camera movement. The crew paid special attention to lighting. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and director Alfredson invented a technique they called [...] "spray light". In an interview, van Hoytema describes it as follows: [...] "If you could capture dull electrical light <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>can</b> and spray it like hairspray across Eli’s apartment, it {{would have the same}} result as what we created". For the emotional scenes between Oskar and Eli, van Hoytema consistently diffused the lighting.|$|E

2500|$|In general, {{there will}} be many {{different}} eigenvalues [...] for which a non-zero eigenvector solution exists. Since the entries in the adjacency matrix are non-negative, there is a unique largest eigenvalue, which is real and positive, by the Perron–Frobenius theorem. This greatest eigenvalue results in the desired centrality measure. The [...] component of the related eigenvector then gives the relative centrality score of the vertex [...] in the network. The eigenvector is only defined up to a common factor, so only the ratios of the centralities of the vertices are well defined. To define an absolute score one must normalise the eigen vector e.g. such that the sum over all vertices is 1 or the total number of vertices n. Power iteration is one of many eigenvalue algorithms that may be used to find this dominant eigenvector. Furthermore, this can be generalized so that the entries <b>in</b> <b>A</b> <b>can</b> be real numbers representing connection strengths, as in a stochastic matrix.|$|E

2500|$|Mooney {{returned}} to America soon afterwards {{on the advice}} of a psychiatrist, having been told that getting away from the chaotic music of Can would be better for his mental health. The liner notes of Monster Movie claim that Mooney suffered a nervous breakdown ("caught <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Can</b> groove"), shouting [...] "upstairs, downstairs" [...] repeatedly. He was replaced by the more understated Kenji [...] "Damo" [...] Suzuki, a young Japanese traveller found busking outside a Munich café by Czukay and Liebezeit. Though he only knew a handful of guitar chords and improvised the majority of his lyrics (as opposed to committing them to paper), Suzuki was asked to perform with the band that same night. The band's first record with Suzuki was Soundtracks, released in 1970, a compilation of music made for films that also contained two earlier tracks recorded with Mooney. Suzuki's lyrics were usually in English, though sometimes in Japanese (for example, in [...] "Oh Yeah" [...] and [...] "Doko E").|$|E
2500|$|In some {{countries}} such as Germany and the Netherlands, container deposit legislation has been introduced on cans and plastic bottles. Parts of Belgium are also considering adopting such legislation. People can thus collect refund value money from this type of waste. The result {{of this is that}} in Germany, hardly any cans or plastic bottles can still be found along the road. In the Netherlands, the amount of litter has dropped considerably since the new law was implemented, and 95% of the plastic bottles are now recycled. According to Chris Snick, the revenue that can be obtained from waste picking can be financially profitable in countries where container deposit legislation has been introduced: in 1 hour he managed to pick up 108 cans and 31 plastic bottles, earning him 13.90 euro (€0.10 per can/plastic bottle). By comparison, in countries where only the value of the aluminum for example would be refunded, 139 cans would yield only 1.72 euro (0.0124 euro per can; assuming there is 15 grams of aluminum <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>can,</b> and with scrap aluminum valued at 0.8267 euro/kg) ...|$|E
2500|$|For a limnic {{eruption}} to occur, {{the lake}} must be nearly saturated with gas. [...] In the two known cases, the major component was CO2; however, in Lake Kivu, scientists {{are concerned about}} the concentrations of methane gas as well. [...] This CO2 may come from volcanic gas emitted from under the lake or from decomposition of organic material. [...] Before a lake is saturated, it behaves like an unopened carbonated beverage (soft drink): the CO2 is dissolved in the water. [...] In both the lake and the soft drink, CO2 dissolves much more readily at higher pressure (Henry's law). This is why bubbles <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>can</b> of soda form only after the can is opened; the pressure is released and the CO2 comes out of solution. [...] In the case of lakes, the bottom is at a much higher pressure; the deeper it is, the higher the pressure at the bottom. [...] This means that huge amounts of CO2 can be dissolved in large, deep lakes. [...] Also, CO2 dissolves more readily in cooler water, such as that {{at the bottom of a}} lake. [...] A small rise in water temperature can lead to the release of a large amount of CO2.|$|E
