5|$|A 1-forest, {{sometimes}} called a maximal pseudoforest, is a pseudoforest to which no more edges {{can be added}} without causing some component of the graph to contain multiple cycles.

5|$|Although all of <b>its</b> <b>components</b> {{had been}} tested in target and drop tests, no full test of a gun-type nuclear weapon {{occurred}} before Hiroshima. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was insufficient uranium-235. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough {{that it was only}} deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly. Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered almost certain to work. Thirty-two drop tests were conducted at Wendover, and only once did the bomb fail to fire. One last-minute modification was made, to allow the powder bags of propellant that fired the gun to be loaded in the bomb bay.|$|E

The only test explosion of a nuclear weapon concept had been of an implosion-type device employing plutonium as its fissile material, and took place on 16 July 1945 at the Trinity nuclear test. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was little uranium-235 {{as compared with the}} relatively large amount of plutonium which, it was expected, could be produced by the Hanford Site reactors. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough that it was only deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly.

5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century {{scientists}} realized that air could be liquefied and <b>its</b> <b>components</b> isolated by compressing and cooling it. Using a cascade method, Swiss chemist and physicist Raoul Pierre Pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide {{in order to}} liquefy carbon dioxide, which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it. He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877 to the French Academy of Sciences in Paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen. Just two days later, French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen. Only {{a few drops of}} the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted. Oxygen was liquified in a stable state {{for the first time on}} March 29, 1883 by Polish scientists from Jagiellonian University, Zygmunt Wr√≥blewski and Karol Olszewski.|$|E

5|$|In an {{analysis}} of <b>its</b> <b>components,</b> IHS's iSuppli estimated that the production cost of the 16GB model of the Nexus7 is $159.25 per unit, $19 more per unit than Amazon.com's competing tablet, the Kindle Fire. The Nexus7's higher production costs were attributed to its use of a higher-quality display, a quad-core processor (instead of the Fire's dual-core), and its inclusion of a camera and near field communications (NFC) functionality. The firm's senior analyst Andrew Rassweiler suggested {{that the success of}} the HP TouchPad's fire sale helped increase the commercial viability of low-cost tablets from major brands, and the failures of other high-end tablets helped reduce the cost of parts, making tablets like the Kindle Fire and Nexus7 possible. However, he also noted that both tablets were being sold at thin profit margins, primarily due to their respective ties to content services.|$|E
