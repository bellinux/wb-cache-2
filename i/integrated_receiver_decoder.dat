50|$|Interactive {{television}} {{represents a}} continuum from low (TV on/off, volume, changing channels) to moderate interactivity (simple movies on demand without player controls) and high interactivity in which, for example, an audience member affects the program being watched. The most obvious {{example of this}} would be any kind of real-time voting on the screen, in which audience votes create decisions that are reflected in how the show continues. A return path to the program provider is not necessary to have an interactive program experience. Once a movie is downloaded for example, controls may all be local. The link was needed to download the program, but texts and software which can be executed locally at the set-top box or IRD (<b>Integrated</b> <b>Receiver</b> <b>Decoder)</b> may occur automatically, once the viewer enters the channel.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{commercial}} DBS {{service in the}} United Kingdom, Sky Television, was launched in 1989 and used the newly launched SES Astra 1A satellite, providing 4 analogue TV channels. The channels and subsequent VideoCrypt video encryption system used the existing PAL broadcast standard. This gave Sky a distinct advantage over {{the winner of the}} UK state DBS licence, BSB. In the following year, after many delays, BSB was launched, broadcasting five channels (Now, Galaxy, The Movie Channel, The Power Station and The Sports Channel) in D-MAC format and using the EuroCypher video encryption system which was based heavily on the General Instruments VideoCipher system used in the USA. While the BSB's broadcast standard and system was technologically more advanced than the PAL based Sky system and one of the main selling points of the BSB offering was the Squarial, an expensive flat plate antenna and LNB. Sky's system used conventional cheap dish and LNB technology. The BSB system used an <b>integrated</b> <b>receiver</b> / <b>decoder</b> whereas the Sky system had standalone decoders and <b>integrated</b> <b>receiver</b> decoders. This allowed Sky to market directly to an audience that already had satellite TV systems. [...] The competition between the two companies was fierce and bidding wars over the UK rights to movies. Sky kept costs to a bare minimum, operating from an industrial park in Isleworth in West London. BSB had expensive offices in London (Marco Polo House). The two services subsequently merged to form British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) though the new BSkyB was really Sky. The technologically more advanced BSB D-MAC/EuroCypher system was gradually replaced with Sky's VideoCrypt video encryption system. [...] In 1994 17% of the group was floated on the London Stock Exchange (with ADRs listed on the New York Stock Exchange), and Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation owns a 35% stake. [...] By 1999, following the launch of several more satellites (at 19.2°E by SES), the number of channels had increased to around 60 and BSkyB launched the first subscription-based digital television platform in the UK, offering a range of 300 channels broadcast from the SES Astra satellites at 28.2°E under the brand name Sky Digital. BSkyB’s analogue service was discontinued on 31 December 2001 and all customers have migrated to Sky Digital. [...] In May 2008, a free-to-air satellite service from the BBC and ITV was launched under the brand name Freesat, carrying a variety of channels, including some content in HD formats.|$|R

40|$|DVB-T 2 (digital video {{broadcasting}} - {{second generation}} terrestrial) is considered {{as the most}} advanced digital terrestrial television system. It supports either or any combination of SD (standard definition), HD (high definition) UHD (ultra-high definition), and mobile TV. One of {{the challenges of the}} DVB-T 2 is the many options it provides in system mode and parameters which needs to be accurately selected to suit different applications. In view of this, requirement for the IRD (<b>integrated</b> <b>receiver</b> <b>decoder)</b> for use with the DVB-T 2 for ASEAN countries has been defined. This paper deals with the transmission performance for the AGWN (additive white Gaussian noise), fixed and portable TV channels. Simulation results of the BER (bit error ratio) after the FEC (Forward Error Correction) decoding were evaluated and compared for the three types of channels. The effect of constellation rotation is being explored for a particular IRD scenario. Appropriate simulations for this study were carried using common simulation platform (CSP) and MATLAB.

40|$|Digital video {{broadcasting}} is {{used for}} digital television transmission, {{which is based on}} moving pictures expert group (MPEG- 2) video compression. The DVB standards are classified into three categories of traditional broadcast networks which are DVB – S for satellite network, DVB – C for cable network, DVB – T for terrestrial network. The digital terrestrial television supports two types of services which are DVB-T and DVB-T 2. DVB-T 2 is considered as the most advanced digital terrestrial television system. It supports high-definition television (HDTV) services using same frequency spectrum, and better performances in mobile environments. Furthermore, in June 2014, version- 1 of DVB-T 2 <b>Integrated</b> <b>Receiver</b> <b>Decoder</b> (IRD) technical specification for ASEAN countries was released with the objective of reaping the benefits of economies of scale for affordable DVB-T 2 IRDs so as to facilitate the adoption of digital TV in ASEAN members’ countries. However, one of the challenges of the DVB-T 2 is the many options it provides in system mode and parameters which needs to be accurately selected to suit different applications. In view of this, this project studied and investigated through simulation the BER versus SNR performance for the IRD specification. This includes the different types of channels: Gaussian, Rician and Rayleigh. In addition simulations for different scenarios were carried out for cases of different guard interval, code rates, effect of constellation rotation in different modulation schemes. The common software platform (CSP) developed for simulation of the DVB-T 2 and Matlab 2014 was used in carrying out the simulations. The result of simulation showed the different BER versus C/N performance of the IRD specification. From the results, {{it can be seen that}} the IRD can be used for different kinds of services and can support both fixed and portable devices based on selected scenario or system requirements...|$|E
