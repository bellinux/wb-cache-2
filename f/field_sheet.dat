He assumed his appointment on 1 July 1910 at which time there were seven members of the Section. All men were professional surveyors and draftsman. CMF officers of the AIC in the Military District Headquarters supervised {{the work of the}} Section. In 1912 the Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia State Governments each agreed to loan a Lands Department Survey Officer to the Survey Section RAE for two years to supervise the work of the Section in each State. Each Survey Officer was a militia officer in the AIC. The Section was divided into two sub-sections and employed in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia producing scale 1 inch to 1 mile military maps ('1 mile' map) mainly of areas around cities and key infrastructure. By mid-1913 the Section had completed topographic <b>field</b> <b>sheets</b> by plane-tabling for eight maps around Newcastle, Melbourne and Canberra. The initial method of using parish plans to position the topographic detail was soon found to be inadequate and a geodetic subsection was established in 1914 to provide surveys by geodetic triangulation as spatial frameworks for the <b>field</b> <b>sheets</b> produced by the topographers. The triangulation work started at Werribee south-west of Melbourne and proceeded west along the coast to Warrnambool. This work included the 1860 Geodetic Survey of Victoria where appropriate - much of which was produced by Royal Engineer officers. The AIC was disbanded in 1914 but the work of the Survey Section continued under the supervision and control of the Intelligence Section of the General Staff under {{the general direction of the}} Chief of the General Staff (CGS).|$|R

The approach first builds an initial frame field on the input hex mesh and optimizes it to obtain a high-quality frame field.

Finally, the structure of the problematic sheet is adjusted based on the high-quality frame <b>field</b> and <b>sheet</b> operations. Experimental results demonstrate that our topological optimization approach can effectively improve the minimal Scaled Jacobian value of the hex mesh...|$|R
