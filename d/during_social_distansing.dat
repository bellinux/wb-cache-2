40|$|The human {{ability of}} identifying, {{processing}} and regulating emotions from social stimuli is generally referred as Emotional Intelligence (EI). Within EI, Ability EI identifies a performance measure assessing individual skills at perceiving, using, understanding and managing emotions. Previous models {{suggest that a}} brain "somatic marker circuitry" (SMC) sustains emotional sub-processes included in EI. Three primary brain regions are included: the amygdala, the insula and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Here, {{our aim was to}} investigate the relationship between Ability EI scores and SMC activity <b>during</b> <b>social</b> judgment of emotional faces. Sixty-three healthy subjects completed a test measuring Ability EI and underwent fMRI <b>during</b> a <b>social</b> decision task (i. e. approach or avoid) about emotional faces with different facial expressions. Imaging data revealed that EI scores are associated with left insula activity <b>during</b> <b>social</b> judgment of emotional faces as a function of facial expression. Specifically, higher EI scores are associated with greater left insula activity <b>during</b> <b>social</b> judgment of fearful faces but also with lower activity of this region <b>during</b> <b>social</b> judgment of angry faces. These findings indicate that the association between Ability EI and the SMC activity <b>during</b> <b>social</b> behavior is region- and emotionspecific...|$|R

40|$|Abnormal {{patterns}} of interpersonal behavior {{may represent a}} putative prodromal feature of major affective disorder (Hammen 2002). However, no {{studies have examined the}} naturalistic {{patterns of}} interpersonal behaviour among the adolescent offspring of parents with BD. The present study examined patterns of interpersonal functioning among 25 adolescents having a parent with BD (high risk) and 23 controls (low risk), between 15 to 25 years of age. Using event-contingent recording procedures in the natural environment, we assessed five dimensions of interpersonal behaviour: quarrelsomeness, agreeableness, dominance, submissiveness, and impulsivity. Behaviours were measured <b>during</b> <b>social</b> interactions occurring over 14 days. Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that the high risk group displayed more impulsive behaviours <b>during</b> <b>social</b> interactions than the low risk group, although this fell short of statistical significance (t = - 1. 88, p <. 056). Group by gender interactions revealed that high risk males displayed significantly more quarrelsome behaviours <b>during</b> <b>social</b> interactions than high risk females and control participants (F = 7. 49, p <. 05). These results are consistent with previous findings suggesting that externalizing behaviour problems precede the development of major affective disorder, and indicate that impulsiveness and quarrelsomeness <b>during</b> <b>social</b> interactions might be an important developmental antecedent of mood disorders among the adolescent offspring of parents with BD...|$|R

When Glutamate receptors are blocked in the LS pharmacologically, there is a significant decrease in female social playing, while males had no decrease in playing.

40|$|In this fMRI {{study we}} {{investigated}} functional connectivity between {{components of the}} mentalising system <b>during</b> a <b>social</b> emotion task, using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis. Ten adults (22 – 32 years) and 18 adolescents (11 – 18 years) were scanned while thinking about scenarios in which a social or a basic emotion would be experienced. Unlike basic emotions (such as disgust and fear), social emotions (such as embarrassment and guilt) require the representation of another’s mental states. In both adults and adolescents, an anterior rostral region of medial prefrontal cortex (arMPFC) involved in mentalising showed greater connectivity with the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) bordering on the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and with anterior temporal cortex (ATC) <b>during</b> <b>social</b> than <b>during</b> basic emotion. This result provides novel evidence that components of the mentalising system interact functionally <b>during</b> a <b>social</b> emotion task. Furthermore, functional connectivity differed between adolescence and adulthood.

40|$|A large {{amplitude}} {{blood pressure}} oscillation occurs <b>during</b> <b>social</b> defeat in a territorial fight between male rats, {{and during the}} application of a psychosocial stimulus associated with this defeat. Synchronous recording of blood pressure, intrathoracic pressure and diaphragm activity shows that the blood pressure oscillation coincides with a typical respiratory pattern called 'pressure breathing', during which a strongly positive intrathoracic pressure with expiration can be observed. The expiration was relatively prolonged and accompanied by a rise in blood pressure and a decrease in heart frequency. These alterations outlast the applied social respectively psychosocial stimulations.

40|$|IntroductionNon-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is {{a symptom}} of {{borderline}} personality disorder (BPD). However, NSSI often occurs independently of BPD. Altered neural processing of social exclusion has been shown in adolescents with NSSI and adults with BPD with additional alterations <b>during</b> <b>social</b> inclusion in BPD patients. Aims of this study were to investigate differences in neural processing of social inclusion and exclusion situations between adolescents with NSSI and young adults with BPD and NSSI. MethodsUsing fMRI, neural processing of positive and negative social situations (paradigm: “Cyberball”) was explored. Participants were 14 adolescents with NSSI, but without BPD (Mage[*]=[*] 15. 4; SD[*]=[*] 1. 9), 15 adults with BPD and NSSI (Mage[*]=[*] 23. 3; SD[*]=[*] 4. 1), as well as 15 healthy adolescents (Mage[*]=[*] 14. 5; SD[*]=[*] 1. 7), and 16 healthy adults (Mage[*]=[*] 23. 2; SD[*]=[*] 4. 4). ResultsBehavioral results showed enhanced feelings of social exclusion in both patient groups as compared to healthy controls but only the NSSI group showed enhanced activation <b>during</b> <b>social</b> exclusion versus inclusion compared to the other groups. While both NSSI and BPD groups showed enhanced activation in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex <b>during</b> <b>social</b> exclusion as compared to their age-matched controls, enhanced activation <b>during</b> <b>social</b> inclusion as compared to a passive watching condition was mainly observed in the BPD group in the dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and the anterior insula. DiscussionWhile neural processing of social exclusion was pronounced in adolescents with NSSI, BPD patients also showed increased activity in a per se positive social situation. These results might point toward a higher responsiveness to social exclusion in adolescents with NSSI, which might then develop into a generalized increased sensitivity to all kinds of social situations in adults with BPD...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for generating believable social behavior in avatars.

Driven by theories on human territoriality, we define a reactive framework which allows avatar group dynamics <b>during</b> <b>social</b> interaction. We model the territorial dynamics of social interactions {{as a set of}} social norms which constrain the avatar’s reactive motion by running a set of behaviors which blend together. The resulting social group behavior appears relatively robust, but perhaps more importantly, it starts to bring a new sense of relevance and continuity to virtual bodies that often get left behind when social situations are simulated. We carried out an evaluation of the technology and the result confirms the validity of our approach. ...|$|R

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Behavioral {{interaction}} <b>during</b> <b>social</b> situations is {{a continuum}} of action, response, and reaction. The temporal nature of social interaction creates a series of stressful situations, such as aggression, displace-ment from resources, and the variable psychological challenge of adapting to dynamic social hierarchies. The {{ebb and flow of}} neurochemical and endocrine secretions <b>during</b> <b>social</b> stress provide a unique tool for understanding individualized responses to stress. Each social station is an adaptive response to a stressful social condition, resulting in unique neuroendocrine and behavioral responses. By examining the temporal changes of limbic monoamines and plasma glucocorticoids, aspects of mechanisms for adaptation emerge. The similarity of temporal patterns induced by social stress among fish, reptiles and primates are remark-able. Even different specific coping mechanisms point out the similarity of vertebrate stress responses. The lizard Anolis carolinensis exhibits a unique sign stimulus generated <b>during</b> <b>social</b> stress by the sympathetic nervous system that serves as a temporal landmark to distinguish neuroendocrine patterns. During social interaction dominant males have a shorter latency to eyespot darkening than opponents, inhibiting aggressive display. Eyespot coloration can be delayed using a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, causing dominant social status in many animals to be lost. Reversal of social status via serotonergic activation appears to mimic chronic serotonergic activity. The pattern of eyespot darkening, faster in dominant males, is coincident wit...|$|R
