6000|$|... "Humph!" [...] ejaculated her father, as if {{convinced}} of the uselessness of trying to understand a woman. [...] "Say, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> strange horse tracks?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very likely.--Take care of it, Jessie," [...] said Stanley, {{throwing}} {{it to his}} wife; [...] "it may be explained some day.--Well, Massan, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> other animals?" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> thing amiss in {{the present}} customs or {{proceedings}} of the Junto, which might be amended? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, as to {{the right}} or wrong of the {{performance}} as a whole. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> objection to the play from a religious point of view?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{decided on}} the title long ago. I call it AVERIL'S ATONEMENT. Doesn't that sound nice and alliterative? Now, Diana, tell me candidly, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> faults in my story?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps it's {{better to}} be pretty. Cleverness is open to any one {{who is willing to}} study. But <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> girl as nice-looking as I am while you were in Canada?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon we'd better stick here, Tom.... Dick, it's {{some good}} to see you again. But you seem kinda quiet. Shore you get quieter all the time. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> sign of Jim out Sonoyta way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Step this way, Mr. Steward," [...] {{said the}} captain; [...] "and report {{the state of}} the coppers. You were rummaging, as usual, among the lockers of yonder unhappy Dane, and I desire to know what discoveries you have made! You will please to recollect, that on all public expeditions of this nature, there must be no peculation or private journal kept. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> stock-fish?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sending {{back one}} of the horses, Karl, and asking the count {{to take care of}} it for me, until I return or send for it. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> {{difference}} between them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jon," [...] {{said his}} father to his mother, under the oak tree, [...] "is terrible. I'm afraid he's {{going to turn out}} a sailor, or {{something}} hopeless. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> sign of his appreciating beauty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Cancer again, like Julia! I {{never knew}} there was cancer in our family. Oh, my good God, our poor Anna, after the life she'd had!--What, lad, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> God {{at the back of}} that?--I'm damned if I do.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{eighteen}} years," [...] said Mrs. Danby placidly. [...] "It's funny you haven't {{heard them}} mentioned. But people don't {{talk much about}} the Captain now--he's an old story--and of course they never go anywhere, not even to church. The Captain is a rank infidel and they say his daughter is just as bad. To be sure, nobody knows much about her, but {{it stands to reason}} that a girl who's had her bringing up must be odd, to say no worse of her. It's not really her fault, I suppose--her wicked old scalawag of a father is to blame for it. She's never darkened a church or school door in her life and they say she's always been a regular tomboy--running wild outdoors with dogs, and fishing and shooting like a man. Nobody ever goes there--the Captain doesn't want visitors. He must have done something dreadful in his time, if it was only known, when he's so set on living like a hermit away down on that jumping-off place. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> of them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do I hold up {{my head as}} it is?" [...] asked Halleck. [...] "Did {{you ever}} see a more abject dog than I am at this moment? Your wounds are faithful, Atherton; but perhaps you might have spared me this last stab. If you want to know, I {{can assure you that}} I don't feel any melodramatic vainglory. I know that I'm running away because I'm beaten, but no other man can know the battle I've fought. Don't you suppose I know how hideous this thing is? No one else can know it in all its ugliness!" [...] He covered his face with his hands. [...] "You are right," [...] he said, when he could find his voice. [...] "I suffer guiltily. I must have known it when I seemed to be {{suffering}} for pity's sake; I knew it before, and when you said that love without marriage was a worse hell than any marriage without love, you left me without refuge: I had been trying not to face the truth, but I had to face it then. I came away in hell, and I have lived in hell ever since. I had tried to think it was a crazy fancy, and put it on my failing health; I used to make believe that some morning I should wake and find the illusion gone. I abhorred it from the beginning as I do now; it has been torment to me; and yet somewhere in my lost soul--the blackest depth, I dare say!--this shame has been so sweet,--it is so sweet,--the one sweetness of life--Ah!" [...] He dashed the weak tears from his eyes, and rose and buttoned his coat about him. [...] "Well, I shall go. And I hope I shall never come back. Though you needn't mention this to my father as an argument for my going when you talk me over with him," [...] he added, with a glimmer of his wonted irony. He waited a moment, and then turned upon his friend, in sad upbraiding: [...] "When I came to you {{a year and a half}} ago, after I had taken that ruffian home drunk to her--Why didn't you warn me then, Atherton? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> danger?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "There's Hairy. Did <b>you</b> ever <b>see</b> two cousins {{look more}} alike? If {{it were not}} that Hairy is bigger than Downy {{it would be hard}} work to tell them apart. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> other difference, Peter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks be to God {{for having}} {{preserved}} us," [...] Harry said reverently. [...] "We are half-full of water; another {{five minutes of}} that work {{and it would have}} been all over with us. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> signs of the canoe, chief?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hal Ha! Ha!" [...] taunted Bo. [...] "Nell Rayner, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> {{green in}} my eyes? Spring to come! Yes, the poet {{said in the}} spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to {{thoughts}} of love. But that poet meant a young woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may depend}} upon my {{returning}} to London to-morrow," [...] he said. [...] "In the meantime, {{is there no}} better way in which I can be of use to you? If your influence fails, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> other chance of keeping Lord Harry's desperate purpose under control?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me suggest, then," [...] I continued, [...] "that <b>you</b> should <b>see</b> Anne Catherick yourself, and <b>do</b> all <b>you</b> can {{to win her}} confidence. For my own part, I {{shrink from}} the idea of {{alarming}} the poor creature a second time, as I have most unhappily alarmed her already. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> objection to accompanying me to the farmhouse to-morrow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How am I {{to get my}} {{opportunity}} of speaking to Mr. Gracedieu? I mustn't call on him again as soon as to-morrow or next day. But I might meet him, out walking alone, if you will {{tell me how to}} do it. A note to my hotel is all I want. Don't tremble, my sweet. If you are not present at the time, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> objection to my owning to your father that I love you?" ...|$|R
60|$|What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> literal {{mistakes}} in my letters? how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> set them right? for I never read {{them over to}} correct them. Farewell, again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hallo, Tommy, old hero, {{here you}} are! What {{is it to}} be? What will you have? I'm taking whisky: better stuff than we get across the water. Soda? Lithia? No mineral? I'm the same. Spoils the flavour.... Here, garcon, bring us two halves of malt whisky, like a good fellow.... Well, and {{how have you been}} pulling along since I saw you last? Dear God, how old we're getting! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> signs of aging in me--eh, what? A little grey and thin on the top--what?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{island in}} the distance," [...] resumed the old man, [...] "is called by the Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe. That a mile to the northward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Islesen, Hotholm, Keildhelm, Suarven, and Buckholm. Farther off--between Moskoe and Vurrgh--are Otterholm, Flimen, Sandflesen, and Stockholm. These are the true names of the places--but why it has been thought {{necessary}} to name them at all, is more than either you or I can understand. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> hear anything? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> change in the water?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'DEAR CYTHEREA--I have {{received}} a frank and friendly letter from Mr. Manston explaining the position in which he stands now, and also that in which he hopes to stand towards you. Can't you love him? Why not? Try, for he is a good, and not only that, but a cultured man. Think of the weary and laborious future that awaits you if you continue for life in your present position, and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> way of escape from it except by marriage? I don't. Don't go against your heart, Cytherea, but be wise.--Ever affectionately yours, OWEN.' ...|$|R
40|$|The 5 {{questions}} {{to be addressed in}} the Workshop are as follows. 1. Within your subject area and given your research, experience and insights, what policy ideas would you suggest to governments in Australia? 2. What actions should the Federal and state governments initiate? 3. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> scope for government leadership, and/or government co-operation with the private sector and with institutions devoted to research, development, innovation and education? 4. Would you favour greater government involvement in the economy, either along the lines we had pre- 1983, or participation of a different and more innovative nature? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> the “end of cheap oil”, climate change and water shortages impacting on your suggested policy positions?...|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} demonstrations {{of the existence of}} syntactic bootstrapping is an experiment done by Roger Brown at Harvard University in 1957. Browns experiment {{was the beginning of the}} framework needed in order for the theory to thrive. He took a nonsense word (like sib) and asked children one of three specific sentences containing the word (1-3). Through his experiments, he showed that children acquire grammar and semantics simultaneously. This led linguists like Lila Gleitman, who coined the term syntactic bootstrapping in 1990, to argue that syntax was pivotal for language learning, as it also gives a learner clues about semantics.

60|$|One of the bottlenosed {{fraternity}} it was went by {{the name}} of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.|$|R

"If {{you will}} leave the five years, from 'seventy-six to 'eighty-one, entirely to me," [...] she resumed, [...] "and take the next five years, {{reckoning}} backward from 'seventy-six, you will help me to better purpose. Sir Jervis expects me to look for reports of Central American Explorations, through the newspapers of the last forty years; and I have taken the liberty of limiting the heavy task imposed on me. When I report my progress to my employer, I should {{like to say that}} I have got through ten years of the examination, instead of five. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> objection to the arrangement I propose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no! You {{understand}} me very well," [...] she answered. [...] "Everybody {{knows that it}} is you who keep us going. Lumley has not got quite used to taking your money. He has lost nearly all his ambition. Soon his day will have gone by. People shrug their shoulders when they speak of us. Two years ago the Wavertons were delighted to know me. Society seems big, but it isn't. There are no end of little sets, one inside the other. Two years ago, I was in the innermost, today I'm getting towards the outside edge.

6000|$|... "My {{regiment}} {{was sent}} to the eastward, as you know, and having just received my new rank of major, it would not do to be absent at the moment. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>see</b> <b>any</b> one here, besides those who belong to the manor?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why don't {{you suppose}} so? What's {{to be the}} end of it all? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> way out of it?--for I do not. Does your father see his way to {{bringing}} those meadows back into his hands? I'm told that some of those fellows shot at Clayton the other day down at Headford. How are we to expect a man like Clayton to come forward and be shot at in that fashion? As far as I can see there will be no possibility for anyone to live in this country again. Of course it's all over with me. I haven't got any rents to speak of, and the only property I possess is now useless." ...|$|R

But oh! <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>see</b> <b>any</b> one so much altered as poor Fred! He looks twenty years older! Ah! I am quite good now! I may go now!' she cried, as the door opened.|$|R
60|$|The first just Observation I made of this was, That I suppos'd from {{hence the}} {{wonderful}} Clearness of the Air, and the Advantage of so vast Optick Capacities they enjoy'd, was obtained: Alas! says the Old Fellow, <b>You</b> <b>see</b> nothing {{to what some}} of our Great Eyes see in some Parts of this World, nor <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> thing compar'd to what <b>you</b> may <b>see</b> by {{the help of some}} new Invented Glasses, of which I may in time let <b>you</b> <b>see</b> the Experiment; and perhaps you may find this to be the reason why we do not so abound in Books as in your Lunar World; and that except it be some extraordinary Translations out of your Country, you will find but little in our Libraries, worth giving you a great deal of Trouble.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are five}} leaves. This great golden one sits alone on her green {{seat at the}} top. These two smaller yellow ones, {{with a touch of}} purple in them, sit on either side; but these two purple ones have only one seat between them, though they are the handsomest of all. Now look here in the middle, and see this little image like a man in a green gown and a red cap hiding away in the warmest, safest place with a bag of seeds which will ripen by-and-by if he will let the sun in. Come now, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> meaning to that, my sons?"

6000|$|... "You {{certainly}} {{have not been}} prejudiced," [...] she admitted. [...] "Whether your politics have been those of an Imperialist from the broadest point of view--well, we won't discuss that question just now. We might, perhaps, differ. But there {{is just one more}} point. Zealously and during the whole of your career, you have set your face steadfastly against any increase of our military power. They say that it is chiefly due to you and Mr. Busby that our army to-day is weaker in numbers than it has been for years. You have set your face steadily against all schemes for national service. You have taken up the stand that England can afford to remain neutral, whatever combination of Powers on the Continent may fight. Now tell me, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> possibility of failure, from the standpoint of a great politician, in your attitude?" ...|$|R
