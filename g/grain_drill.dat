40|$|AbstractA new {{controlled}} seed {{metering unit}} {{was designed and}} mounted on a common <b>grain</b> <b>drill</b> for direct seeding of wheat (DSW). It comprised the following main parts: (a) a variable-rate controlled direct current motor (DCM) as seed metering shaft driver, (b) two digital encoders for sensing the rotational speed of supplemental ground wheel (SGW) and seed metering shaft and (c) a control box to handle and process the data of the unit. According to the considered closed-loop control system, the designed control box regularly checked the revolution per minute (RPM) of seed metering shaft, as operation feedback, using its digital encoder output. The seeding rate was determined based on the calculated error signal and output signal of the digital encoder of the SGW. A field with four different levels of wheat stubble coverage (10 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 %) was selected for evaluation of the fabricated seed metering unit (FSMU). The dynamic tests were conducted to compare the performance of installed FSMU on the <b>grain</b> <b>drill</b> and equipped <b>grain</b> <b>drill</b> with common seed metering unit (CSMU) at three forward speeds of 4, 6 and 8 (Km/h) for DSW. Results of the FSMU assessment demonstrated that an increase in forward speed of <b>grain</b> <b>drill</b> (FSGD) and stubble coverage did not significantly affect the seeding rate in the <b>grain</b> <b>drill</b> for DSW. Using the FSMU reduced the coefficient of variation (CV) by approximately 50 %.

40|$|A three-year field {{experiment}} (2004 - 2007) {{was conducted on}} a silty clay loam soil at Tajarak Research Station of Hamedan to determine proper <b>grain</b> <b>drill</b> for wheat in Hamedan dryland areas. In this study, three grain drills including: Hamedani Barzegar; Sahalan Kesht; and Kesht Gostar with wheat seed broadcasting and disking were used. The experiment was a randomized complete block design with four replications. In laboratory, the precision of metering device {{and the amount of}} seed damage by metering mechanism were measured. At the end of growth season (harvesting time), crop yield and the associated parameters (spike per m 2, number of grain per spike, wheat kernel) were determined. Results showed that planting methods did not affect wheat grain yield significantly. However, wheat grain yield was significantly higher for Kesht Gostar <b>grain</b> <b>drill</b> than the other two machines in two drier years. Mean wheat grain yield was 1224 kg ha– 1. Mean wheat grain yield was the greatest (1275 kg ha- 1) for Kesht Gostar and the least (1174 Kg ha- 1) for Hamedani Barzegar <b>grain</b> <b>drill.</b> Mean straw yield was not affected by planting methods. Mean wheat straw yield was the greatest (2349 kg ha- 1) for Hamedani Barzegar <b>grain</b> <b>drill,</b> and the least (2009 Kg ha- 1) for the combination of seed broadcasting and disking. The amounts of rainfall during growing season strongly influenced wheat grain and straw yields. Mean wheat grain yield was 1572 Kg ha- 1 and 1026 Kg ha- 1 in wet year and dry years, respectively.

40|$|Growers can plant soybean [Glycine max(L.) Merr. ] with a <b>grain</b> <b>drill</b> or {{row crop}} planter, which can affect seed and weed control costs and yield. Farmers planted soybean with a <b>grain</b> <b>drill</b> in 0. 19 m rows and a row crop planter in 0. 38 and 0. 76 m rows at {{recommended}} (420, 000 seeds ha 1) and reduced (321, 000 seeds ha- 1) seeding rates in two field-scale studies in New York to obtain agronomic information and conduct partial budget analyses to aid growers in future planter purchase decisions. Soybean intercepted more light in 0. 19 (65 - 70 %) compared with 0. 76 m rows (50 - 55 %) at flowering, despite lower early plant establishment (~ 70 and ~ 85 %, respectively) at both locations. At the no-till location, soybean in 0. 76 m rows compared with narrower rows had greater weed density at full pod stage (19. 7 vs. 6. 3 and 5. 1 plants m- 2) and biomass at harvest (13. 7 vs. 6. 6 and 7. 3 g m- 2), but similar yield (~ 3. 30 Mg ha- 1). At the chisel tillage location, soybean in 0. 19 m rows at 420, 000 seeds ha- 1 yielded more (4. 27 Mg ha- 1) than other row spacing by seeding rate combinations (4. 15 to 4. 01 Mg ha- 1).

40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{to estimate}} the mass of grain seeds, which flow {{in the shape of}} clumps, was suggested in this paper. The methodology used an off-the-shelf digital fibre sensor to detect the behaviour of the clumps and multiple linear regression modelling {{to estimate the}} mass by the parameters detected by the sensor which were the length and the density of the clumps. An indoor apparatus was used for modelling which resembled the sowing process using the <b>grain</b> <b>drill.</b> A fluted roller was installed in the apparatus to regulate the flow of seeds. It was rotated by a motor at 2, 4 and 6 rpm to cover all the possible mass flow rates which might occur during actual sowing. Modelling was based on several assumptions, such as the linearity between the sensor parameters and the mass. Although errors were observed while estimating each clump independently, the methodology was able to estimate the mass of a continuous flow of seed clumps. The average difference in estimation at 4 rpm was 0. 9 %, while there was overestimation at 2 rpm and underestimation at 6 rpm resulting in an overall estimation error of 5. 3 %. These results showed that the digital fibre sensor could be used for estimating mass flow of seeds at variable sowing rates within the speed limits of the <b>grain</b> <b>drill.</b> (C) 2013 Elsevier B.
