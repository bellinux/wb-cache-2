40|$|During the March 2009 quarter {{production}} {{levels of}} all stage one wood processing in New Zealand declined {{compared with the}} same quarter last year. Many mills reported shift reductions or extended shut downs, due to a decline in both domestic and international demand. With the exception of particleboard and wood pulp, <b>export</b> <b>volumes</b> decreased in the March 2009 quarter, {{compared with the same}} quarter in the previous year. In contrast, a favourable exchange rate and lower sea freight costs meant that export earnings from all forest products increased. <b>Export</b> <b>volumes</b> to most trading partners declined in the March 2009 quarter, with the exception of China, who increased <b>export</b> <b>volumes</b> of New Zealand logs, sawn timber and wood pulp exports. Particleboard was the only product with increased export earnings this quarter. Harvesting activity Roundwood removals over the March 2009 quarter declined 8. 3 percent to 4. 3 million cubic metres compared with the December 2008 quarter. This is the lowest level of harvesting since March 2006. The main drivers for this were declining demand for wood products, and industry efforts to reduce inventory levels. Export logs and poles International demand for New Zealand logs weakened in the March 2009 quarter compared with the December 2008 quarter, with exports declining to all major trading partners except China. Total log <b>export</b> <b>volumes</b> were 1. 6 million cubic metres, down 12. 7 percent compared with the previous quarter. <b>Export</b> <b>volumes</b> to China over the March 2009 quarter increased 29. 7 percent to 842 000 cubic metres compared with the December 2008 quarter.

To motivate our …ndings we extend the model of Corsetti and Dedola (2005) with local distribution costs and allow …rms to export multiple products with heterogeneous levels of quality. The model shows that the elasticity of demand perceived by exporters decreases with a real depreciation and with quality, leading to more pricing-to-market and to a smaller response of <b>export</b> <b>volumes</b> to a real depreciation for higher quality goods.
