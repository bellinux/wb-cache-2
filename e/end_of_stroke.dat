50|$|In the {{conventional}} double-acting engine, residual steam {{was trapped in}} the exhausting cylinder after the valve closed and compressed. This compressed steam has a cushioning effect and acts to brake the piston at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>stroke.</b> In the single-acting engine there is no similar effect {{at the end of}} the power stroke. This had previously been a limitation on the operating speed of single-acting engines.|$|E
50|$|In the Willans engine, {{cushioning}} at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> {{was provided}} by an additional air cylinder below the others. The air piston also acted as a trunk guide. During the upward stroke, inertia of the engine continues its movement upwards and before the next stroke begins there is otherwise nothing to retard it. The enclosed air cylinder acts as a compressed air dashpot above the trunk guide piston.|$|E
50|$|In a {{double-acting}} steam engine, {{as used in}} {{a railway}} locomotive, {{the direction of the}} vertical thrust on the slide bar is always upwards when running forward. It varies from nothing at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> to a maximum at half stroke when the angle between the con-rod and crank are greatest. When the crank-pin drives the piston, as when coasting, the piston thrust is downwards. The position of maximum thrust is shown by the increased wear at the middle of the slide bars.|$|E
25|$|Typefaces can {{be divided}} into two main categories: serif and sans serif. Serifs {{comprise}} the small features at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>strokes</b> within letters. The printing industry refers to typeface without serifs as sans serif (from French sans, meaning without), or as grotesque (or, in German, grotesk).|$|R
50|$|The {{tendency}} of the variable force on the upper slide is to lift the machine off its lead springs at half-stroke and ease it down at the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>stroke.</b> This causes a pitching and, because the maximum up force is not simultaneous for the 2 cylinders it will also tend to roll on the springs.|$|R

The paper discusses a study of the kinematics and performance of such a new isokinetic rehabilitation system actuated by pneumatic muscles.

40|$|The paper {{reports a}} {{theoretical}} investigation into {{various aspects of}} cold forming through conical con-verging die at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>stroke.</b> At {{this stage of the}} process, there occur some phenomena that require discussion. A well-known defect in extrusion is cavity formation at the center {{on the back of the}} billet, a process that begins as the billet is shortened. The cavity gradually increases in diameter and depth, transforming the emerging rod into a pipe of increasing inner diameter, with the result that this portion of the product is discarded. This defect can be reduced or eliminated if dies of smaller cone angles are used. The results so obtained are discussed critically to illustrate the interaction of various process parameters involved and are presented graphically...|$|E
40|$|A small-footprint, full surface-mount-component {{printed circuit}} board employs MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) power {{switches}} to switch high currents from any input power supply from 3 to 30 V. High-force shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators generally require high current (up to 9 A at 28 V) to actuate. SMA wires (the driving element of the actuators) can be quickly overheated if power is not removed at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>stroke,</b> which can damage the wires. The new analog driver prevents overheating of the SMA wires in an actuator by momentarily removing power when the end limit switch is closed, thereby allowing complex control schemes to be adopted without concern for overheating. Either an integral pushbutton or microprocessor-controlled gate or control line inputs switch current to the actuator until the end switch line goes from logic high to logic low state. Power is then momentarily removed (switched off by the MOSFET). The analog driver is suited to use with nearly any SMA actuator...|$|E

In most print, they are often used for headings rather than for body text. They are often used to convey simplicity and modernity or minimalism.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{introduces}} a new kinematics of the billet reheating furnace unloading door, {{by using a}} noncircular gear train in the drive mechanism. The main objective of the kinematics modification {{is to reduce the}} heat loss by increasing the unloading door speed, during the stroke, while kept it at the conventional value at the beginning and <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>stroke.</b> In order to modify the door kinematics, the drive mechanism output motion is controlled by noncircular gears whose transmission ratio is defined as a hybrid multiparameters function. A study is developed to analyse the influence of the defining parameters on the variation of the gears transmission ratio and on the discharging door speed, respectively. Based on the analytical study, a certain law of variation was chosen to describe the mechanism kinematics; in accordance to the kinematics variation, the mating noncircular centrodes/pitch curves were modelled and the gears teeth are generated, considering constant circular pitch and constant pressure angle, respectively...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis work {{is devoted}} to {{computer}} simulation of electro-pneumatic drives for vertical motion mobile robots. These robots are equipped with suction pads to move on walls and ceiling. An output highlights a conflict between the main requirements to such robot drives: simultaneous ensuring of high speed and smoothness of movement of robots with a considerable mass of moved objects. The low efficiency of traditional cushion systems of cylinders is shown in development of such kind of robots. New structure of electro-pneumatic drive for applications with considerable inertia load is developed. This structure represents mechatronic system and consists from the set of on-off valves and computer control device that operates the valves and reaches the optimum motion control of the object with required smoothness. This could be achieved due to the multistep braking in the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>stroke.</b> The paper also represents the mathematical model of developed drive with description of throttle elements, friction forces and details of computer control systems. Mathematical model realized in computer program allows to simulate processes of movement of electro-pneumatic drives. The results of computer modeling show that developed structure and multistep computer control allows to develop effective electro-pneumatic drives for high-quality and high-speed control of massive objects {{in the part of}} vertical motion mobile robots. Developed program represents effective analysis instrument, so it can be used in the process of design engineering...|$|E

50|$|To provide long opening times, the bash valve {{normally}} incorporates {{some form}} of tappet mechanism. Rather than a valve that is held open by the piston directly, the valve becomes double-acting and is opened by the piston's impact at one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke</b> and closed by a further impact at the other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke.</b> The tappet and valve are commonly separate, allowing the valve to remain in a well-defined fully open position throughout the stroke, however the tappet is bounced around by the piston.|$|R

5000|$|Carter Sans is a {{typeface}} by Matthew Carter, {{in collaboration}} with Dan Reynolds. In style, it {{is described as a}} [...] "hybrid sans-serif" [...] or [...] "humanist stressed sans" [...] ("flare serif", [...] "glyphic serif"), as it does not have serifs, but letters do flare slightly near the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>strokes,</b> which is particularly notable in the capitals. This is a relatively rarer style, and Carter states that he was particularly influenced by Albertus (1932-40) by Berthold Wolpe, also of Monotype.|$|R
30|$|The {{long-stroke}} {{pumping units}} {{often have a}} mechanical reversing mechanism that may suffer damage if {{the speed of the}} reversal at each <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke</b> is too rapid. Therefore, Watson (1993) disclosed a controller that may operate to slow down at both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the long <b>stroke,</b> to have different speeds on the upstroke or down stroke in order to increase the production of fluid without increased mechanical wear on the lifting string.|$|R

5000|$|The third {{engine is}} also double acting using the {{two-stroke}} cycle, {{and although it}} has the gas and air pumps of the others, it has an exhaust port uncovered by the piston towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the power <b>stroke,</b> allowing the exhaust gases to exit and the fresh charge to enter the power cylinder and then be compressed by the piston prior to ignition at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the compression <b>stroke.</b>|$|R
50|$|Serif fonts, i.e.: fonts {{with small}} {{appendages}} at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>strokes,</b> hinder lexical access. Word recognition is quicker with sans-serif fonts {{by an average}} of 8 ms. These fonts have significantly more inter-letter spacing, and studies have shown that responses to words with increased inter-letter spacing were faster, regardless of word frequency and length. This demonstrates an inverse relationship between fixation duration and small increases in inter-letter spacing, most likely due to a reduction in lateral inhibition in the neural network. When letters are farther apart, {{it is more likely that}} individuals will focus their fixations at the beginning of words, whereas default letter spacing on word processing software encourages fixation at the center of words.|$|R
25|$|With {{high-performance}} camshaft timing, {{exhaust valves}} in different cylinders can be {{open at the}} same time, overlapping at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the power <b>stroke</b> in one cylinder and the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> exhaust <b>stroke</b> in another. In twin-scroll designs, the exhaust manifold physically separates the channels for cylinders that can interfere with each other, so that the pulsating exhaust gasses flow through separate spirals (scrolls). With common firing order 1-3-4-2, two scrolls of unequal length pair cylinders 1-4 and 3-2. This lets the engine efficiently use exhaust scavenging techniques, which decreases exhaust gas temperatures and NOx emissions, improves turbine efficiency, and reduces turbo lag evident at low engine speeds.|$|R

40|$|Aspirin is {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} antiplatelet agent for the secondary prevention <b>of</b> <b>stroke.</b> Cilostazol, an antiplatelet and vasodilating agent, has shown promise for the secondary prevention <b>of</b> <b>stroke.</b> A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials using Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, and Excerpta Medica (EMBASE) was searched up to October 2012. Four trials, in 3, 917 patients, comparing cilostazol with aspirin were identified. Compared with aspirin, cilostazol {{was associated with a}} 73 % reduction in hemorrhagic stroke (relative risk [RR] 0. 27, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 13 to 0. 54, p = 0. 0002), 28 % reduction in the composite <b>end</b> point <b>of</b> <b>stroke,</b> myocardial infarction, or vascular death (RR 0. 72, 95 % CI 0. 57 to 0. 89, p = 0. 003), and 48 % reduction in total hemorrhagic events (RR 0. 52, 95 % CI 0. 34 to 0. 79, p = 0. 002), with trend for lesser gastrointestinal bleeds (RR 0. 60, 95 % CI 0. 34 to 1. 06, p = 0. 08). In conclusion, compared with aspirin, cilostazol is associated with significantly less hemorrhagic stroke, the combined <b>end</b> point <b>of</b> <b>stroke,</b> myocardial infarction, and vascular death, and total hemorrhagic events, with numerically fewer gastrointestinal bleeds when used for the secondary prevention <b>of</b> <b>stroke...</b>|$|R
