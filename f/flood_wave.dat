25|$|The {{reservoir}} {{opened on}} 8 May 1797, however in June 1799 the eastern dam burst releasing a <b>flood</b> <b>wave</b> downstream along the Crane Brook Valley towards Shenstone, about 4.5 {{miles to the}} south east. The cause of the burst was not clear however it was likely that no overflow system was provided and a summer storm caused the dam to overtop and erode the earth embankment. The <b>flood</b> <b>wave</b> caused significant damage with roads and bridges destroyed, fields flooded and livestock killed. The canal company paid out compensation to all who had suffered losses and set about rebuilding the dam. The dam was rebuilt thicker and wider than previously with its inner faces lined with limestone. In the March 1800 the dam had been rebuilt by Thomas Dadford and the reservoir refilled. A watch house was built by the canal company with a full-time watchman to safeguard against any similar incidents in the future.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the known}} {{height of the}} <b>flood</b> <b>wave,</b> and that within seventy minutes or less after the {{collapse}} the reservoir was virtually empty, the failure must have been sudden and complete. Seconds after it began, little {{of what had been}} the dam remained standing, other than the center section and wing wall. The main dam, from west of the center section to the wing wall abutment atop the hillside, broke into several large pieces, and numerous smaller pieces. All of these were washed downstream as 12.4 billion gallons (47 billion liters) of water began surging down San Francisquito Canyon. The largest piece, weighing 10,000 tons, (9,071,847kg) was found about three-quarters of a mile (1200m) below the dam site.|$|E

2500|$|During Saddam Hussein's rule, the {{construction}} of the Mosul Dam began in 1981 by a German-Italian consortium that was led by Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft. Because the dam was constructed on a foundation of soluble gypsum, the engineers recommended thorough grouting within the foundation before the superstructure was built. Instead, to speed construction of the dam, engineers blanket-grouted [...] deep around the foundation and a curtain [...] directly below the dam. A grouting gallery that would allow continuous grouting of the dam's foundation in order to promote stability was also installed. Construction was complete in 1984 and in the spring of 1985, the Mosul Dam began to inundate the Tigris River, filling the reservoir which submerged many archaeological sites in the region. The power station began generating power on 7 July 1986. Because of significant structural stability issues associated with the Mosul Dam, ongoing grouting and additional construction and repairs are necessary. In 1988, Iraq began construction on the Badush Dam downstream which would serve the primary purpose of absorbing and releasing a Mosul Dam <b>flood</b> <b>wave</b> {{in the event of a}} breach. Works were halted in 1991 though due chiefly to UN sanctions.|$|E
2500|$|Under {{steady state}} flow {{conditions}} (e.g. no <b>flood</b> <b>wave),</b> {{open channel flow}} can be subdivided into three types of flow: uniform flow, gradually varying flow, and rapidly varying flow. [...] Uniform flow describes a situation where flow depth does not change with distance along the channel. [...] This can only occur in a smooth channel that does not experience any changes in flow, channel geometry, roughness or channel slope. [...] During uniform flow, the flow depth is known as normal depth (yn). [...] This depth {{is analogous to the}} terminal velocity of an object in free fall, where gravity and frictional forces are in balance (Moglen, 2013). [...] Typically, this depth is calculated using the Manning formula. [...] Gradually varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is very small. [...] In this case, hydrostatic relationships developed for uniform flow still apply. [...] Examples of this include the backwater behind an in-stream structure (e.g. dam, sluice gate, weir, etc.), when there is a constriction in the channel, and when there is a minor change in channel slope. [...] Rapidly varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is significant. In this case, hydrostatics relationships are not appropriate for analytical solutions, and continuity of momentum must be employed. [...] Examples of this include large changes in slope like a spillway, abrupt constriction/expansion of flow, or a hydraulic jump.|$|E

General description and classification of <b>flood</b> <b>waves</b> are described in initial part of the work. Then the phenomenon of floods, their characteristics and flood protection measures are descibed. Measures for flood protection can be divided into river training activities and alteranive measures. First mean construction of buildings to improve conditions of river flow and with other we try to mitigate damage and to reduce consequences of the pfenomenon. Further on, the computation of <b>flood</b> <b>waves</b> with the programme PCFLOW 2 D, that was developed at the Chair of fluid mechanics with a laboratory is desribed.
