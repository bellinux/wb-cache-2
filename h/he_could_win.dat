5|$|At {{the same}} time, Quisling {{believed}} {{that the only way}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>win</b> back Hitler's respect would be to raise volunteers for the now-faltering German war effort, and he committed Norway wholeheartedly to German plans to wage total war. For him at least, after the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, Norway now had a part to play in keeping the German empire strong. In April 1943, Quisling delivered a scathing speech attacking Germany's refusal to outline its plans for post-war Europe. When he put this to Hitler in person, the Nazi leader remained unmoved despite Norway's contributions to the war effort. Quisling felt betrayed over this postponement of Norwegian freedom, an attitude that waned only when Hitler eventually committed to a free post-war Norway in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|Chappuis {{was drafted}} by the Pittsburgh Steelers, and reports in February 1948 {{indicated}} that the Steelers had offered him a two-year contract for $20,000 per year. However, Chappuis passed up the Steelers' offer, opting instead {{to play for the}} new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). In June 1948, Chappuis signed with Branch Rickey's Brooklyn Dodgers of the AAFC after coach Carl Voyles outbid the Steelers for his services at $17,000. Chappuis had been drafted by the Cleveland Browns, and the Dodgers gave the Browns three draft picks in exchange for the right to sign Chappuis. Rickey had felt that modern football was based on speed and that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>win</b> with a good center, passing quarterback and two tall sprinting ends. Thus, he placed a premium on signing Chappuis, the passing quarterback. The college All-star game caused Chappuis to miss three weeks of practice and he played little in the early season games because he had not learned his plays.|$|E
5|$|Discharged {{from the}} army, Willkie {{returned}} to Elwood. He considered {{a run for}} Congress as a Democrat, but was advised that the district was so Republican he {{would be unlikely to}} keep the seat even if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>win</b> it, and his chances might be better in a more urban area. Herman Willkie wanted Wendell and Robert to rejoin the family law firm, but Henrietta was opposed, feeling that opportunities in Elwood were too limited for her sons. She got her way, and in May 1919 Wendell Willkie successfully applied for a job with the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio as head of the legal office that advised workers on wills and other personal matters. He was soon bored there, and on the advice of his wife, left for a law firm despite an offer from Harvey Firestone to double his salary. Firestone told the departing lawyer that he would never amount to anything because he was a Democrat.|$|E

5|$|In November 1644 Rupert was {{appointed}} General {{of the entire}} Royalist army, which increased already marked tensions between him {{and a number of}} the King's councillors. By May 1645, and now desperately short of supplies, Rupert captured Leicester, but suffered a severe reversal at the Battle of Naseby a month later. Although Rupert had counselled the King against accepting battle at Naseby, the opinions of Digby had won the day in council: nonetheless, Rupert's defeat damaged him, rather than Digby, politically. After Naseby, Rupert regarded the Royalist cause as lost, and urged Charles to conclude a peace with Parliament. Charles, still supported by an optimistic Digby, believed <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>win</b> the war. By late summer Rupert had become trapped in Bristol by Parliamentary forces; faced with an impossible military situation on the ground, Rupert surrendered Bristol in September 1645, and Charles dismissed him from his service and command.|$|E
5|$|Perot's {{performance}} {{satisfied the}} 5% popular vote threshold for third party candidates, classifying it as successful under the criterion established by scholar Walter Dean Burnham. The legitimacy of this {{success has been}} questioned by scholars who dismiss the label of Perot as a typical third party candidate, {{largely due to the}} availability of campaign funds and financing of grassroots efforts. Others dispute these claims and point out that Perot forced the other candidates to change their rhetoric on the issues to gain the votes of his supporters, indicating an issues campaign. Exit polls revealed that 35% of voters would have voted for Perot if they believed <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>win.</b> Contemporary analysis reveals that Perot could have won the election if the polls prior to the election had shown the candidate with a larger share, preventing the wasted vote mindset.|$|E
5|$|Bart gladly accepts Martin's offer, {{as there}} is no other way <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>win</b> over Nelson. Homer, however, feels betrayed by Bart's choice to drive Martin's racer instead of the one he helped Bart to make. When Bart tries to {{apologize}} to Homer, he selfishly denounces both Bart and Martin, telling Bart to do whatever he wants. Marge steps in and tells Homer that she has defended him through a lot of things over the years, but his latest actions prove that he is a bad father. As Bart gets ready to race in the final match with Martin's newly tuned racer, Homer thinks to himself about how selfish he has been, realizing that Bart needs his support regardless of whose racer he is using, and he rushes off to the race. At the starting line, Homer wishes Bart good luck and tells him that no matter how the race ends he will still be proud of him. The race is tough as Nelson pulls every dirty trick in his arsenal, but eventually through his skill Bart finishes first and the team enjoys their victory.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the pool}} halls in 1870s Pittsburgh also {{broadcast}} horse races via telegraph. The often colorful race descriptions soon captured young Smith's attention and he wrote down and stockpiled the names and times of the winning horses for a year to form crude racing charts. In the fall of 1879, Smith placed his first bet on a 5:1 odds horse named Gabriel running in a race at the Brighton Beach racetrack at Coney Island. He won $38 when the horse won by 2 lengths but did not show any outward signs of emotion while the race was run. Determined that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>win</b> at horse racing, Smith quit {{his job at the}} cork factory and accrued more than $5,000 from betting on horse races in the next two years, hiding the proceeds under his mattress at home. Upon his mother eventually discovering the money, he reasoned with her that he was not really gambling because he was making logical predictions based on the past performances of horses and not merely guessing. By 1885, Smith had {{become one of the most}} touted gamblers in Pittsburgh and had won over $100,000 without ever seeing a horse race run firsthand. However, Smith was becoming too famous in Pittsburgh. He could not maintain the favorable, high odds when placing bets that he had attained earlier in his career when he was a virtual unknown because everyone in the crowd would lower the odds by betting his choices.|$|E

25|$|DeLay won the Republican primary on March 7, 2006, getting 62% of {{the vote}} in the four-way race. DeLay outspent his closest opponent, Tom Campbell, by a near 20-1 ratio.

25|$|Once again, Frank Norman was Colten's opponent, but the {{incumbent}} {{had the advantage}} because the community leadership lined up solidly behind him. Yet, Colten seemed unsure as to whether <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>win</b> again and took nothing for granted. He had first considered running as an Independent {{in the general election}} but chose in the end to remain a Republican. In their 1970 rematch, Colten defeated Norman 2,381 votes (58.9 percent) to 1,661 ballots (41.1 percent).|$|E
25|$|In October 1901, Dawes {{left the}} Department of the Treasury {{in order to}} pursue a U.S. Senate seat from Illinois. He thought that, {{with the help of}} the McKinley Administration, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>win</b> it. McKinley was assassinated and his successor, President Theodore Roosevelt, {{preferred}} Dawes's opponent. In 1902, following this unsuccessful attempt at legislative office, Dawes declared that he was done with politics. He organized the Central Trust Company of Illinois, where he served as its president until 1921.|$|E

25|$|In the post-race interviews, the Ferrari drivers {{changed their}} {{story of what}} had {{happened}} at the finish with each telling. Other teams insisted that Ferrari had made a mockery of the sport again, while some said Schumacher had simply bungled an improvised formation finish. Earlier in the year Barrichello had been ordered to let Schumacher past on the final lap so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>win</b> the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix. So many saw this result as Schumacher returning the favour.|$|E
25|$|The {{potential}} {{annexation of}} the Republic of Texas by President John Tyler upended the presidential race; while Van Buren and the Whig frontrunner, Henry Clay, opposed the annexation {{and a potential}} war with Mexico over the disputed territory, Polk and Andrew Jackson strongly supported territorial acquisition. Disappointed by Van Buren's position, Jackson instead decided to support Polk as the party's presidential candidate in the 1844 election, though Polk was skeptical that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>win.</b> However, as Van Buren continued to receive opposition from the West and South, Polk's key lieutenant at the convention, Gideon Johnson Pillow, noted the possibility of Polk emerging as a compromise presidential nominee.|$|E
25|$|State Representative Richie Sanders {{announced}} he would challenge Baker for his Senate seat in 1996 after legislative redistricting made it unlikely <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>win</b> re-election to his seat in the House. On April 8, 1996, Democratic Governor Paul E. Patton announced his appointment of Baker to the Kentucky Supreme Court, replacing Justice Charles H. Reynolds, who died in January. Baker's appointment left Democrat Jake Dickinson as the perceived favorite to defeat Sanders and win Baker's seat in the Senate. Baker resigned his seat in the Senate on April 15, {{the final day of}} the legislative session, and was sworn in as a justice an hour later.|$|E

Gibson was still looking for win number 20 {{on the last day}} of the season, a game where new Cardinals manager Red Schoendienst rested many of the regular players. Gibson still prevailed against the Houston Astros by a score of 5–2. The 1966 season marked the opening of Busch Memorial Stadium for the Cardinals, and Gibson was selected to play in the All-Star Game in front of the hometown crowd that year as well.|$|E
25|$|He {{held the}} title until JCP's first {{pay-per-view}} event Starrcade in November, {{when he dropped}} it to Dusty Rhodes in a steel cage. This loss {{set the stage for}} Luger leaving the Four Horsemen, as manager Dillon's interference cost Luger the match. A steel chair thrown in by Dillon was dropped by Luger and Rhodes DDT'd Luger on it prior to pinning him for the win. Luger left the Four Horsemen in 1988 after he and his stablemates (Tully Blanchard, Arn Anderson, and Dillon) were the sole wrestlers left in a Bunkhouse Stampede battle royal and Dillon asked the other wrestlers to eliminate themselves so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>win.</b> Although Blanchard and Anderson complied, Luger refused and eliminated Dillon, leaving the Horsemen in the process.|$|E
25|$|In 1810, United States Senator Buckner Thruston {{resigned}} {{to serve as}} a judge on the United States Circuit Court, and Clay was selected by the legislature to fill the seat for the fourteen months remaining on the term. In his first speech, Clay called for a more aggressive policy towards Britain. On the insistence of the Kentucky legislature, Clay helped prevent the re-charter of the First Bank of the United States, arguing that it interfered with state banks and infringed on states' rights. Clay also advocated the annexation of West Florida, which the Spanish also claimed. After serving in the Senate for one year, Clay decided that he disliked the rules of the Senate. Though he felt confident that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>win</b> election to a full Senate term, Clay instead chose to seek election to the United States House of Representatives. He easily won the election.|$|E
