But since Jain sources postdate Buddhist ones, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> between {{the nature of}} the early Jain school and {{elements}} derived from other schools. Most of the other contemporary yoga systems alluded in the Upanishads and some Pali canons are lost to time.|$|E
5|$|A.viridimontanum is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> {{from its}} parent {{species in the}} field. It can {{generally}} be separated from A.pedatum by {{the shape of the}} ultimate segments (the smallest divisions of the leaf), and by its habitat on thin, exposed serpentine soils rather than in rich woodlands. It more closely resembles A.aleuticum; however, the stalks of the ultimate segments and the false indusia are longer and the spores larger.|$|E

50|$|The glossy-mantled manucode is medium-sized, around 42 cm long, glossed green, {{blue and}} purple black {{with a red}} iris, black bill, long {{graduated}} tail and somewhat elongated upper breast and neck feathers. Both sexes are similar. The female is a slightly smaller than the male.

5|$|C.mutica closely {{resemble}} Caprella acanthogaster, also {{a native of}} East Asian waters. It may be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> the two species, particularly since Caprellamutica can exhibit considerable morphological variations among males. C.mutica can only be reliably differentiated by their setose first and second pereonites (smooth in C.acanthogaster), {{as well as the}} elongated oval shape of their gills (linear in C.acanthogaster).|$|E
5|$|Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas {{may vary}} from {{undifferentiated}} to well-differentiated. They are often {{surrounded by a}} brisk fibrotic or desmoplastic tissue response; {{in the presence of}} extensive fibrosis, it can be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> well-differentiated cholangiocarcinoma from normal reactive epithelium. There is no entirely specific immunohistochemical stain that can distinguish malignant from benign biliary ductal tissue, although staining for cytokeratins, carcinoembryonic antigen, and mucins may aid in diagnosis. Most tumors (>90%) are adenocarcinomas.|$|E

Hence some {{researchers}} have been moved to suggest a European origin {{for at least some}} H3/6 clasts: America and Europe were originally adjacent to one another; hence, the rocks on each continent are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish,</b> and the source is open to interpretation (Grousset et al. 2000).|$|E

5|$|Niobium, {{formerly}} columbium, is {{a chemical}} element with symbol Nb (formerly Cb) and atomic number 41. It is a soft, grey, ductile transition metal, {{often found in}} the minerals pyrochlore (the main commercial source for niobium) and columbite. Its name comes from Greek mythology, specifically Niobe, who {{was the daughter of}} Tantalus, the namesake of tantalum. The name reflects the great similarity between the two elements in their physical and chemical properties, making them <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nycticebus bengalensis, {{commonly}} known as the Bengal slow loris or northern slow loris, is a strepsirrhine primate in the slow loris genus, Nycticebus. Formerly considered a subspecies of the Sunda slow loris (N.coucang), it was recognized as a distinct species in 2001 by taxonomist and primatologist Colin Groves. It is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> from the other species in its genus.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{fundamental}} problem of computer vision {{is caused by}} the translation of a three-dimensional world onto one or more two-dimensional planes. As a result, methods for extracting regions of interest (ROIs) have certain limitations that cannot be overcome with traditional techniques that only utilize a single projection of the image. For example, while it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguished</b> two overlapping, homogeneous regions with a single intensity or color image, depth information can usually easily be used to separate the regions. In this paper we present an extension to an existing saliency-based ROI extraction method. By adding depth information to the existing method many previously difficult scenarios can now be handled. Experimental results show consistently improved ROI segmentation. ...|$|R

5|$|Telopea oreades {{is one of}} five {{species from}} southeastern Australia that make up the genus Telopea. No {{subspecies}} are recognised. It has been <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> from the similar T.mongaensis, but microscopic analysis has revealed that T.oreades has features termed sclereids while T.mongaensis does not. The two are sister species, and their next closest relative is the Tasmanian waratah (T. truncata).|$|E
5|$|Based on {{external}} appearance, Plectania nannfeldtii {{is similar to}} Pseudoplectania vogesiaca. Although this latter species may be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> by its less hairy external fruit body surface, its microscopic characters identify it more definitively: P.vogesiaca has spores that are much smaller, typically with widths of 12–14µm. Helvella corium is another black cup fungus that appears in the spring; it has smaller spores, whitish margins on the cup edges, and shorter stems than P.nannfeldtii. Pseudoplectania nigrella is smaller, with a hairier outer surface, a darker inner cup surface, and a rudimentary stem.|$|E

5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{definitively}} diagnosed from tissue, i.e. it {{is proven}} by biopsy or examination of the tissue excised at surgery. It may be suspected in a patient with obstructive jaundice. Considering it as the working diagnosis may be challenging in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); such patients {{are at high risk}} of developing cholangiocarcinoma, but the symptoms may be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> from those of PSC. Furthermore, in patients with PSC, such diagnostic clues as a visible mass on imaging or biliary ductal dilatation may not be evident.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles have lighter greys {{and browns}} amidst the starker {{blacks and whites}} of their plumage; two- or three-year-old birds of both sexes closely {{resemble}} and are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> from adult females. Immature birds have dark brownish eyes until around two years of age. Australian magpies generally live to around 25 years of age, though ages of up to 30 years have been recorded.

5|$|Most Hydrophiinae are {{completely}} aquatic and {{have adapted to}} their environments in many ways, the most characteristic {{of which is a}} paddle-like tail that has improved their swimming ability. To a varying degree, the bodies of many species are laterally compressed, especially in the pelagic species. This has often caused the ventral scales to become reduced in size, even <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> from the adjoining scales. Their lack of ventral scales means they have become virtually helpless on land, but as they live out their entire lifecycles at sea, they have no need to leave the water.|$|E

5|$|The Alcathoe bat (Myotis alcathoe) is a European bat in {{the genus}} Myotis. Known only from Greece and Hungary {{when it was}} first {{described}} in 2001, its known distribution has since expanded to Spain, England, Sweden, and Azerbaijan, among other countries. It is similar to the whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus) and other species and is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> from them. However, its brown fur is distinctive and it is clearly different in characters of its karyotype and DNA sequences. Although some genetic data suggest that it is related to Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus), other analyses do not support a close relationship between M.alcathoe and any other species.|$|E
5|$|The Norman {{expansion}} into Wales slowed in the 12th century but remained an ongoing {{threat to the}} remaining native rulers.

These timber castles, including Tomen y Rhodywdd, Tomen y Faerdre, Gaer Penrhôs, were of equivalent quality to the equivalent Norman fortifications in the area, and it can prove <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> the builders of some sites from the archaeological evidence alone.|$|E
