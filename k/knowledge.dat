We consider the application of four angles of scrutiny, discontinuity, contingency, emergences and subjugated <b>knowledges</b> (Foucault 1977, 1980, 1988). We explain the four angles of scrutiny and consider how these can be used to produce research practices commensurate with Foucaultian inspired genealogical strategies. For instance, we argue that subjugated <b>knowledges</b> form a critical component of the four angles of scrutiny. We propose that through their subjugation, these <b>knowledges</b> offer a different perspective to dominant <b>knowledges</b> on sexuality and psychopathology. It is our argument that it is precisely via this subjugation that these types of <b>knowledges</b> offer valuable perspectives to the construction of young people.

25|$|The Innate <b>Knowledge</b> {{thesis is}} similar to the Intuition/Deduction thesis in the regard that both theses claim <b>knowledge</b> is gained a priori. The two theses go their {{separate}} ways when describing how that <b>knowledge</b> is gained. As the name, and the rationale, suggests, the Innate <b>Knowledge</b> thesis claims <b>knowledge</b> is simply part of our rational nature. Experiences can trigger a process that allows this <b>knowledge</b> to come into our consciousness, but the experiences don't provide us with the <b>knowledge</b> itself. The <b>knowledge</b> has been with us since the beginning and the experience simply brought into focus, in the same way a photographer can bring the background of a picture into focus by changing the aperture of the lens. The background was always there, just not in focus.|$|E

One of the leading research projects in this area was the Cyc project. Cyc was an attempt to build a huge encyclopedic <b>knowledge</b> base that would contain not just expert <b>knowledge</b> but common sense <b>knowledge.</b> In designing an artificial intelligence agent it was soon realized that representing common sense <b>knowledge,</b> <b>knowledge</b> that humans simply take for granted, was essential to make an AI that could interact with humans using natural language.

25|$|To begin with, Kant's {{distinction}} between the a posteriori being contingent and particular <b>knowledge,</b> and the a priori being universal and necessary <b>knowledge,</b> must be kept in mind. For if we merely connect two intuitions together in a perceiving subject, the <b>knowledge</b> is always subjective because it is derived a posteriori, when what is desired is for the <b>knowledge</b> to be objective, that is, for the two intuitions {{to refer to the}} object and hold good of it necessarily universally for anyone at any time, not just the perceiving subject in its current condition. What else is equivalent to objective <b>knowledge</b> besides the a priori, that is to say, universal and necessary <b>knowledge?</b> Nothing else, and hence before <b>knowledge</b> can be objective, it must be incorporated under an a priori category of the understanding.|$|E

The specific context for the study is two recently planned commercial redevelopments for the south London borough of Croydon in the United Kingdom, and the arguments mustered in support of these proposals. The author identifies and discusses three principal sets of geographical <b>knowledges,</b> which he examines under the headings symbolic, biopolitical, and scalar. In each case, he shows that the <b>knowledges</b> have strong modernist overtones. The paper seeks both to understand and contextualize these historical connections, and to consider the contemporary political work performed by the <b>knowledges</b> in question. ...|$|R

It is argued that structural and cultural readings can usefully {{be applied to the}} self-representations of migrant women. The context of migrant women's self-representations is explored through looking at the story-telling communities they develop and through the expert <b>knowledges</b> of institutions regulating migration. The dichotomisation of unique versus collective modes of life-stories is questioned. Applying the Foucauldian concept of subjugated <b>knowledges,</b> it is argued that migrant women's life-stories hold transformative potential for producing <b>knowledges</b> critical of gendered and ethnocised power relations that research should pay attention to.
