5|$|Dougie steals the deputy's {{wedding ring}} and knocks over a {{container}} of Epsom salts <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> where the unconscious Greer is soaking after Scully removed several specimens from his neck wounds. While Angela Villareal relieves herself, she spots the creature in the tub with the deputy. Mulder and Scully enter the bathroom and find the clothes of the deputy but the man gone. Mulder theorizes that the entity does not just live in water but is a living form of water, becoming visible only when it attacks. He believes that the creature uses people as hosts to reproduce, with the body's water content being used to feed the growth of new creatures. Mulder realizes that everyone needs to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{performs}} a science experiment {{to see if}} cola will dissolve a tooth, and Bart shocks Lisa {{as part of his}} project to prove that nerds conduct electricity. The tooth is also shocked; it undergoes an unusual reaction and creates a race of miniature beings. Lisa discovers this the next day and marvels at how the people in her universe evolve at a rapid rate. Bart destroys some of the ecosystem in Lisa's tub universe, and the people respond by sending a squadron of space ships to attack him. Lisa is shrunk and beamed down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub,</b> where the citizens explain that they regard her as God, and they want her to do something about Bart, whom they regard as the Devil. She says she can help them if they unshrink her, but they tell her they have not figured out the technology to do that. Bart grabs the tub and submits it in the science fair, and Lisa is forced to watch from within as Bart wins first prize. Realizing that she is now stuck in the small universe forever, Lisa orders her citizens to grovel and bring her some shoes.|$|E

It ran down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubs</b> placed to catch it, dripped from the mossy pump, and drummed on the upturned milk pails, and upon the brown and yellow {{beehives}} under the maple trees. The chickens seemed depressed, but the irrepressible bluejay screamed amid it all, with the same insolent spirit, his plumage untarnished by the wet. The barnyard showed a horrible mixture of mud and mire, through which Howard caught glimpses of the men, slumping to and fro without more additional protection than a ragged coat and a shapeless felt hat.|$|R
25|$|The {{reason for}} this is that human {{activities}} are adding CO2 to the atmosphere faster than natural processes can remove it (see carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere for a complete explanation). This is analogous to a flow of water into a bathtub. So long as the tap runs water (analogous to the emission of carbon dioxide) <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> faster than water escapes through the plughole (the natural removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere), then the level of water in the tub (analogous to the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) will continue to rise.|$|E
500|$|Gilly later {{finds himself}} {{attracted}} to Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan); he initially fears he is {{moving on to}} soon. Whilst interviewed by Inside Soap Quinlan describes the scenes in which they share their first kiss stating: [...] "Gilly gets a new job at Look Sharpe as a personal trainer, and invites Lynsey for a free session, Lynsey's looking pretty good when she turns up, so Gilly gets a bit sweaty and hot under the collar - and she ends up hopping <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> and dragging Gilly in fully clothed!" [...] They later meet up and feel awkward because of Gilly's grief for Steph, of this Quinlan adds: [...] "They're getting on well, {{but as soon as}} the word date is mentioned, it goes a bit wrong, nerves get the better of them and they have a huge row." [...] Off-screen Quinlan was not happy with the fact Gilly is trying to move on quick, of this he states: [...] "I thought it was a bit harsh, it feels like it's a little too soon, doesn't it? We'll just have to wait and see what the future holds for Gilly and Lynsey - but there's no comparison to Steph..." ...|$|E
2500|$|A way to {{visualize}} the difference, is that an ordinary tsunami is caused by sea floor changes, somewhat like pushing {{up on the floor}} of a large tub of water to the point it overflows, and causing a surge of water to [...] "run off" [...] at the sides. In this analogy, a megatsunami would be more similar to dropping a large rock from a considerable height <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub,</b> at one end, causing water to splash up and out, and overflow at the other end.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} implementation of a solar-powered hot <b>tub.</b> <b>The</b> concept of this project was to design an independently-operated hot tub powered by a 12 V rechargeable battery, charged during the day by a single 400 W solar panel. For this purpose, a twenty-year-old name-brand hot tub was purchased, in used condition. The plumbing, AC electrical wiring, and mechanical pumps were all removed and replaced with new components to meet our design specifications. Additionally, a solar water-heater was designed and integrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> system to directly apply the sun’s heat to water pumped {{in and out of}} <b>the</b> <b>tub,</b> which significantly reduced the power budget for the system. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> structure was fitted with energy efficient LED lighting for night-time use. Lastly, a user-friendly control and display unit was designed and embedded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub’s</b> mechanical structure to allow owners to adjust and set modes of operation, jet and heat cycle times, and lighting options. Our design allows an owner to continually power their hot tub at no additional cost every month. This project served as a channel through which much of our studies in microelectronic, embedded system, and power system design got put into practice...|$|R
2500|$|Locating popular {{fiction in}} the bathroom, Tarantino {{reinforces}} {{its association with}} shit, already suggested by the dictionary meanings of [...] "pulp" [...] that preface the movie: moist, shapeless matter; also, lurid stories on cheap paper. What we have then {{is a series of}} damaging associations— pulp, women, shit— that taint not only male producers of mass-market fiction but also male consumers. Perched on the toilet with his book, Vincent is feminized by sitting instead of standing as well as by his trashy tastes; preoccupied by the anal, he is implicitly infantilized and homosexualized; and the seemingly inevitable result is being pulverized by Butch with a Czech M61 submachine gun. That this fate has to do with Vincent's reading habits is strongly suggested by a slow tilt from the book on the floor directly up to the corpse spilled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Saw III {{was given}} a larger budget of $10 million, {{compared}} to Saw IIs $4 million. Principal photography took place for 27 days at Toronto's Cinespace Film Studios from [...] to late June. [...] Production borrowed the bathroom set used in Scary Movie 4, which parodied Saw and Saw II, since it closely resembled the old set. [...] Almost all the transitions {{from one place to}} another were not made using digital effects; the transitions were shot on the spot. For example, when the camera moves from Troy's crime scene to Kerry being in the bathtub, Meyer had to run, take off all her clothes, and jump <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub.</b> Visually the film is akin to the previous two with using quick cuts and fast-paced rhythms. Bousman said, [...] "We're using a lot of whip pans and [...] to create a dynamic feel". [...] Post-production services were provided by Deluxe.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2011, Lynsey became {{attracted}} to widower Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan) {{and they began}} a short relationship. After Gilly became a personal trainer at Look Sharpe, a local day spa, he invited Lynsey to come along for a free session. Quinlan told Inside Soap journalist, Steven Murphy, that Lynsey is [...] "looking pretty good when she turns up" [...] and she would eventually end up [...] "hopping <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> and dragging Gilly in there fully clothed!" [...] Hassan said that she found the scene in which Lynsey pulled Gilly into the hot tub [...] "embarrassing", despite knowing Quinlan well. She added that the scenes were not romantic to film due to the water being cold. Lynsey and Gilly later arranged a date together, which prompted Gilly to remove his wedding ring. Quinlan thought that Gilly's decision was a [...] "bit harsh" [...] {{because it was too}} soon for him to consider moving on from his wife, Steph (Carley Stenson). The actor stated that viewers would have to wait {{to see what would happen}} between Lynsey and Gilly, but believed that there was no comparison when it came to her and Steph.|$|E

This is the feeling in a coal-mine--only more so--much more so, for the darkness is the [...] "gross darkness of the inner sepulchre."

50|$|Steinbier is not mashed in kettles, but in wooden tubs.

Some manufacturers have compounded this problem by [...] "overmolding" [...] <b>the</b> drum bearing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>tub</b> to reduce manufacturing costs, but this makes the bearing impossible to renew without replacing <b>the</b> entire outer <b>tub</b> - which usually forces owners to scrap the entire machine - this may be viewed as an implementation of built-in obsolescence.|$|R
