5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, {{they tend to be}} totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the things about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic {{within the framework of the}} drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
500|$|To all the praise, Youngblood responded, [...] "I don't {{consider}} myself tough, I {{consider myself}} a nut {{for some of the}} things I did". Youngblood concluded, [...] "I wasn’t the biggest guy, I certainly wasn’t the strongest and I wasn’t the fastest either. [...] But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> my biggest assets was that I had an undeniable determination to be the best that has ever {{put his hand on the}} ground, I had a genuine desire to be great." ...|$|E

"the physics {{department}} UCL, with Mike Seaton, my supervisor, {{had very}} close relations with JILA and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> three students there who eventually came to JILA.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{she told}} him, [...] "I'm {{glad that you}} asked me to come with you. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> your first friends and I'm pleased that you should wish to spend part of your last day in my company." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{why should}} you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> do not like you? Indeed, without flattery, I {{can assure you that}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most {{beautiful}} women I have ever seen.' ...|$|R
500|$|During the {{pre-production}} for the episode, {{the cast}} and crew realized that the Halloween conceit would allow the various cast members to wear costumes, rather than their [...] "usual, realistically plain suits". B. J. Novak called the dress-up experience [...] "fun", noting that [...] "seeing the most serious of our plotlines play out alongside such silly and bizarre visuals was, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most inspired ideas of the episode's writer, Greg Daniels." [...] The idea for Pam to be dressed as a cat was inspired by several unused stories, created by Gene Stupnitsky, in which [...] "Pam Beesley must disguise herself as a cat". The plot lines were vetoed by the shows writers, but Stupnitsky successfully petitioned to allow Pam to wear a cat costume.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} National Basketball Association athletes—current and former—{{paid tribute to}} Scott, {{including}} Stephen Curry, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Jason Collins, Shaquille O'Neal, Magic Johnson, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Bruce Bowen, Dennis Rodman, James Worthy and others. A number of golfers paid tribute to Scott: Tiger Woods, Gary Player, David Duval, Lee Westwood, Blair O'Neal, Jane Park and others. Other athletes paid tribute including Robert Griffin III, Russell Wilson, Jon Lester, Lance Armstrong, Barry Sanders, J. J. Watt, David Ortiz and Sheryl Swoopes. UNC basketball coach Roy Williams called him a [...] "hero." [...] Arizona Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians said: [...] "We lost a football game but we lost more this morning. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the best {{members of the media}} I've ever dealt with, Stuart Scott, passed away." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Scott had {{accepted}} the job Demme had rejected, he said: [...] "My first question was: 'What about Jonathan?' and they said: 'The original team said it's too violent.' I said, 'Okay. I'll do it.'" [...] Scott did, himself, have some uncertainty with the source material. In particular, he had difficulties with {{the ending of the}} novel, in which Lecter and Starling become lovers: [...] "I couldn't take that quantum leap emotionally on behalf of Starling. Certainly, on behalf of Hannibal—I'm sure that's been {{in the back of his}} mind for a number of years. But for Starling, no. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the attractions about Starling to Hannibal is what a straight arrow she is." [...] He also [...] "didn't buy the book from the opera scene onwards, which became like a vampire movie." [...] He asked Harris if he was [...] "married to his ending". Harris said he was not, so Scott changed it.|$|E
5000|$|Writer Clive Barker has stated, [...] ""I was, and am, a {{huge fan}} of Starstruck, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most brave and elegant {{experiments}} in comic book story-telling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; he'll be Duke of Omnium {{when the}} old fellow dies. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the slowest fellows I ever came across. He'll take deuced good care of the property, though." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure we {{all think}} that," [...] added Roger. [...] "Since he went to Oak Hall {{he has made a}} host of real friends, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them will desert him." ...|$|R
500|$|Soon after, Scott Borchetta, CEO of Big Machine Records, signed Swift to {{his newly}} formed label. Early into the album production, {{in a meeting}} where Borchetta and Swift {{discussed}} potential songs for Swift's debut album, she performed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] for Borchetta on fluke ukulele. According to Swift, as soon as Borchetta finished listening to the song, he faced Swift and said, [...] "That's your first single." [...] She responded, [...] "Well. That's how that works then." [...] Prior to that event, Swift {{did not believe that}} the song was single material. However, she followed what label executives told her and accepted that they were correct. Swift placed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] as the first track on Taylor Swift because of its importance to her. The song was eventually released as a CD single on June 19, 2006. In retrospect, Swift has said that the song [...] "is reminiscent, and it is thinking about a relationship you had and then lost. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most powerful human emotions is what should have been and wasn't... That was a really good song to start out on, {{because a lot of people}} can relate to wanting something you can't have." [...] When the song's subject discovered it, he thought it was [...] "cool" [...] and kept friendship with Swift despite their breakup.|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the {{disturbing}} {{things is that}} you're starting to see this in some [...] you know, it's not just sort of right-wing ultranationalist skinhead types. It's now you're getting some fairly otherwise respectable intellectuals that are left of center who are anti-globalization who are starting to let this stuff creep into their rhetoric.|$|E
2500|$|Buscema next {{produced}} {{a series of}} Western, war, and sword and sandal film adaptations for Dell's Four Color series. Buscema recalled, [...] "I did a bunch of their movie books ... {{that was a lot}} of fun. I worked from stills on those, except for The Vikings. ...<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the best books I ever did was Sinbad the Sailor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, many {{circumstances}} might constitute such an union,' said Katherine; 'but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> if <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the parties}} {{were in love}} with another person, that would be quite sufficient to ensure a tolerable portion of wretchedness.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some, sir, that is {{scarcely}} fit to slush a mast with, and <b>I</b> do <b>think,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most atrocious cheeses, sir, it was ever my bad fortune to meet with. I do not wonder the Africans left the wreck." ...|$|R

2500|$|I may {{remark that}} the curious transformations many {{formulae}} can undergo, the unsuspected {{and to a}} beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the chief difficulties {{in the early part}} of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one's elbows in one shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 14, 2008, when Quinn {{was asked}} about his {{relationship}} with Blagojevich, he said, [...] "Well, he's a bit isolated. I tried to talk to the Governor, but the last time I spoke to him was in August of 2007. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the problems is the Governor did sort of seal himself off from all the statewide officials... Attorney General Madigan and myself and many others." [...] Blagojevich had announced in 2006 that Quinn was not to be considered part of his administration.|$|E
2500|$|Orson Welles was so {{impressed}} by McGoohan's stage presence ("intimidated," [...] Welles would later say) that he cast him as Starbuck in his York theatre production of Moby Dick—Rehearsed. Welles said in 1969 that he believed McGoohan [...] "would now be, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the big actors of our generation if TV hadn't grabbed him. He can still make it. He was tremendous as Starbuck." [...] and [...] "with all the required attributes, looks, intensity, unquestionable acting ability and {{a twinkle in his}} eye." ...|$|E
5000|$|Of Tati, Lynch {{would add}} in a {{conversation}} with Jonathan Rosenbaum, [...] "You know, I feel like in a way he's a kindred soul... That guy is so creative, it's unbelievable. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the all-time greats." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The fair body of {{this lady}} dwells {{in a large}} soul, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> though <b>one</b> <b>of</b> a {{somewhat}} sombre hue, for souls have their colours, Allan, and stain that which is within them. She {{will never be a}} happy woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Emily," [...] she said. [...] "You know I am amongst {{those few}} {{who knew her}} well--you also, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> were <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them. There was no one I was more fond of--no one whom I have missed so much." ...|$|R
2500|$|Rowling said [...] "I've never thought, 'It's {{time for}} a post-9/11 Harry Potter book,' no. But what Voldemort does, in many senses, is terrorism, and that was quite clear in my mind before 9/11 happened.... but there are {{parallels}}, obviously. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the times I felt the parallels was when I was writing about the arrest of Stan Shunpike, you know? I always planned that {{these kinds of things}} would happen, but these have very powerful resonances, given that I believe, and many people believe, that there have been instances of persecution of people who did not deserve to be persecuted, even while we're attempting to find the people who have committed utter atrocities. These things just happen, it's human nature. There were some very startling parallels at the time I was writing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2009, [...] "Swim Until You Can't See Land" [...] and its b-side [...] "Fun Stuff" [...] {{were made}} {{available}} for streaming on the FactCat website. A video for [...] "Swim Until You Can't See Land", which featured flickering flashlights, was made available on 16 October, and the single was {{made available for}} digital download on 16 November and on seven-inch vinyl on 7 December. Alongside {{the announcement of the}} album's title on Scottish music blog, The Pop Cop, the band unveiled a fifth member, Gordon Skene, formerly of Make Model. Later, NME confirmed the band would be playing a special intimate show in London to celebrate Skene's arrival. Similar to Andy Monaghan's entry into the band in early 2008, Skene was not involved in recording the album. Upon his arrival, Hutchison noted that [...] "it must be difficult for him coming into something that four other people were involved in studio-wise. He's not seen any of that process yet. He's coming in playing these songs that perhaps he likes, but doesn't have that same level of connection with, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the aims [...] is to try and help build that for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, (Untitled) was {{met with}} almost {{universal}} critical acclaim and strong international sales, with advance orders alone accounting {{for the sale of}} 100,000 copies. The album's success continued the revival of the band's commercial fortunes that had begun with the release of their previous album, Ballad of Easy Rider. Many fans at the time regarded the album as a return to greatness for the band and this opinion was echoed by many journalists. Bud Scoppa, writing in the November 16, 1970 edition of Rock magazine, described the album as [...] "easily their best recorded performance so far – in its own class as much as the records of the old Byrds were – and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the best half-dozen albums of 1970." [...] Ben Edmonds' review in the December issue of Fusion magazine was also full of praise: [...] "(Untitled) is a joyous re-affirmation of life; {{it is the story of}} a band reborn. The Byrds continue to grow musically and lead stylistically, but they do so with an unailing sense of their past." [...] Edmonds concluded his review by noting that [...] "History will no doubt bear out the significance of The Byrds' contribution to American popular music, but, for the time being, such speculations are worthless because (Untitled) says that The Byrds will be making their distinctive contributions for quite some time to come." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{remember}} {{shooting the}} video with Wayne Isham {{in front of}} a sold out crowd at the Spectrum in Philadelphia, unfortunately it received minimal airplay as MTV was changing its format... still, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the best videos we've done..." ...|$|R
5000|$|Of Nasser, Ravelo says, [...] "He's a good trainer. He {{teaches the}} right things. He {{tells you what}} to do. He motivates his fighters. I know he don't {{get a lot of}} credit because he's young. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the better coaches out there." ...|$|R
6000|$|I sat down. [...] "Give me the potion," [...] I said. [...] "If {{the worst}} {{comes to the}} worst it will save having my hair cut, and that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most hateful duties of a civilised man. How do you take the mixture?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mashune was, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the bravest}} men I ever {{knew in the}} daytime, {{but he had a}} more than civilized dread of the supernatural.|$|E
6000|$|... "On the whole, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> us {{had better}} go," [...] Charnock {{answered}} with some dryness. [...] "If you don't mind, I'll get off to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And Sir Andrew Arnold," [...] {{broke in}} Dick, [...] "who, like some others, is, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> His ministers. Still, {{we had better}} be riding, master." ...|$|E
6000|$|Violet Hamilton laughed. [...] "Ah," [...] she said, [...] "one {{should never}} put one's suspicions into words like that. Besides, <b>I</b> almost <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> your {{observations}} {{was a little}} misleading. There are reasons for believing that you are quite familiar {{with the kind of}} life you were referring to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} not," [...] Matteo said. [...] "I had never dreamt of {{doing more than}} {{recovering}} the Pluto, and when you first talked about that, it seemed almost like madness. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> us had the slightest belief {{in the possibility of}} the thing, when you first proposed it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Today was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> her {{greatest}} races to date. Maybe her best," [...] said Brown. [...] "Giving eight pounds {{to the horse}} she ran down late in the stretch after breaking through the gate, going a little wide, she just overcame everything. ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the all-time greats." ...|$|R
