40|$|Context: Heat cured acrylic resins undergo {{dimensional}} {{changes during}} polymerization. Dimensional changes which {{occur in the}} <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> acrylic resins are shrinkage and expansion which affects the fit of the denture and occlusal relationship. Aims: The {{purpose of this study}} was to access the linear dimensional changes of four <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> acrylic resins before and after curing and compare the changes among four different acrylic brands. Materials and Methods: Twenty four patients irrespective of age and sex were taken and four commercially available brands were procured. After the teeth arrangement on the mandibular trial denture, two pins were fixed in central fossae of first molar on both sides and one pin in the cingulum of left central incisor. Meliodent <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> acrylic resin was used in Group A; Trevalon <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> acrylic resin was used in Group B; Triplex <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> acrylic resin was used in Group C and Vertex <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> acrylic resin was used in Group D. Linear measurements of the trial wax up before and after curing and before and after finishing and polishing were measured and compared. Collected data was analyzed with analysis of variance and ′t′ test at 95 % level of confidence (P= 0. 05). Results: The maximum percentage changes were seen in cases of Group A (Meliodent) followed by Group B, Group C and Group D (Trevalon, Triplex and Vertex). Meliodent showed the highest percentage change i. e. 1. 18 % and Vertex showed least percentage change of 0. 37 %. Conclusions: Shrinkage occurred after curing and after finishing and polishing, which varies significantly with the four commercially available <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> acrylic resins. Among the four different brands of <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> acrylic resin Group D (Vertex) had the least linear dimensional changes after curing and after finishing and polishing, so that D (Vertex) could be the material of choice for fabrication of complete denture among the four brands...|$|E

Also, to compare the flexural strength of high impact <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> resin with regular <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> resin denture bases. Edentulous casts with deep, medium and shallow palatal vault depth were selected. Three different moulds were made in silicone duplicating material. 12 modified casts in each group of palatal vault were made in dental stone. Two different types of <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> resins- regular and high impact were used. A total of 36 specimens obtained were stored in water at room temperature and subjected to fracture in Universal testing machine.

40|$|O bjectives: Heat-polymerized {{acrylic resin}} {{has been the}} most {{commonly}} used denture base material for over 60 years. However, the mechanical strength of acrylic resin is not adequate for long-term clinical performance of dentures. Consequently, fracture is a com- mon clinical occurrence, which often occurs in the midline of denture base. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of cold cure and <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> acrylic resins, rein- forced with glass fibers, polyethylene fibers, and metal wire for denture base repair. Materials and Methods: Ninety specimens were prepared and allocated to nine groups. Ten specimens were included in the control group, and 80 were allocated to 8 experi- mental groups. In the experimental groups, the specimens were sectioned into two halves from the middle, and were then divided into two main groups: one group was repaired with <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> acrylic resin, and the other with cold cure acrylic resin. Each group was di- vided into 4 subgroups: unreinforced, reinforced with glass fibers, polyethylene fibers, and metal wire. All specimens were then subjected to a 3 -point bending test, and the flexural strength was calculated. Results: The group repaired with <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> acrylic resin and reinforced with glass fiber showed the highest flexural strength; however, the group repaired with cold cure acrylic resin and reinforced with polyethylene fibers had the lowest flexural strength. There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups repaired with <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> and cold cure acrylic resins without reinforcement.

40|$|Background: Conventional <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> poly methyl {{methacrylate}} (PMMA) {{is the most}} commonly used denture base resin despite having some short comings. Lengthy polymerization time being one of them and in order to overcome this fact microwave curing method was recommended. Unavailability of specially designed microwavable acrylic resin made it unpopular. Therefore, in this study, conventional <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> PMMA was polymerized by microwave energy. Aim and Objectives: This study was designed to evaluate the surface porosities in PMMA cured by conventional water bath and microwave energy and compare it with microwavable acrylic resin cured by microwave energy. Materials and Methods: Wax samples were obtained by pouring molten wax into a metal mold of 25 mm × 12 mm × 3 mm dimensions. These samples were divided into three groups namely C, CM, and M. Group C denotes conventional <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> PMMA cured by water bath method, CM denotes conventional <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> PMMA cured by microwave energy, M denotes specially designed microwavable acrylic denture base resin cured by microwave energy. After polymerization, each sample was scanned in three pre-marked areas for surface porosities using the optical microscope. As per the literature available, this instrument is being used {{for the first time to}} measure the porosity in acrylic resin. It is a reliable method of measuring area of surface pores. Portion of the sample being scanned is displayed on the computer and with the help of software area of each pore was measured and data were analyzed. Results: Conventional <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> PMMA samples cured by microwave energy showed maximum porosities than the samples cured by conventional water bath method and microwavable acrylic resin cured by microwave energy. Higher percentage of porosities was statistically significant, but well within the range to be clinically acceptable. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this in-vitro study, conventional <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> PMMA can be cured by microwave energy without compromising on its property such as surface porosity...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of different denture cleansers on the color stability, surface hardness, and roughness of different denture base resins. Materials and Methods: Three denture base resin materials (conventional <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> resin, high impact resin, and polyamide denture base resin) were immersed for 180 days in commercially available two denture cleansers (sodium perborate and sodium hypochlorite). Color, surface roughness, and hardness were measured for each sample before and after immersion procedure. Statistical Analysis: One-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc honestly significant difference test were used to evaluate color, surface roughness, and hardness data before and after immersion in denture cleanser (α = 0. 05). Results: All denture base resins tested exhibited a change in color, surface roughness, and hardness to some degree in both denture cleansers. Polyamides resin immersed in sodium perborate showed a maximum change in color after immersion for 180 days. Conventional <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> resin immersed in sodium hypochlorite showed a maximum change in surface roughness and conventional <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> immersed in sodium perborate showed a maximum change in hardness.

40|$|Context: Relining with <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> {{denture base}} resin is {{time-consuming}} {{and the patient}} has to remain without dentures within this period. Recently, some autopolymerizing resins marketed as hard chairside reline systems with low exothermic heat allow the dentists to reline prosthesis directly in the mouth. However, {{the decision to use}} these materials must be based on physical properties such as dimensional accuracy that directly influences the accuracy of fit of the denture base. Aim: The aim was to compare the linear dimensional changes of two hard chairside reline resins with two laboratory <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> resins at 3 times intervals after processing. Settings and Design: A stainless steel split mold (International Organization for Standardization 1567) was used for sample fabrication. Five measurements of the reference dimensions (AB and CD) were measured directly from the mold and the samples with a profile projector, and mean difference were calculated. Subjects and Methods: Forty samples were fabricated by incorporating the split mold into first pour of denture flasks and packing each of the chairside reline resins ("Kooliner" and "Ufi Gel Hard") and laboratory <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> resins ("Dental Products of India Heat Cure" and "Trevalon"). The mean difference in dimensional change at 3 times intervals (0 h, 4 days and 2 months) were calculated and subjected to statistical analysis. Statistical Analysis Used: One-way ANOVA, RMANOVA and post hoc Tukey′s tests. Results: All resins showed different levels of significant shrinkage (P < 0. 001) after processing (T 0) ranging from − 0. 128 to − 0. 310 mm. After 4 days (T 1), there was significant shrinkage (P < 0. 001) ranging from − 0. 168 to − 0. 296 mm.

40|$|Background: Acrylic resin {{dentures}} {{are susceptible to}} fracture after clinical use, which {{is a problem of}} concern in prosthodontics. Impact failure outside the mouth and flexure fatigue failure in the mouth are two most important causes of fracture of denture base. Aim: This study evaluated the transverse deflection and transverse strength of four commercial brands of <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> acrylic resin (Stellon, Acrylin-H, Trevalon and Trevalon-HI). Materials and Methods: An experimental design was adapted. Twenty-four rectangular strip specimens, six for each group, were prepared. Strips were finished on the edges and equally from the both the molded surfaces to make strips of specific dimensions. The tests were conducted mainly in accordance with the American Dental Association Specification no. 12 /ISO: 1567 - 1981 (ISO: 6887 - 1986) for denture base polymer. The transverse deflection and transverse strength were measured by Instron testing machine. Intergroup differences were assessed using student "t" test. Results: The <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> denture base material D (Trevalon "HI") had the minimum mean value of transverse deflection under different loads. Trevalon "HI" also had minimum value of mean transverse strength among different brands of acrylic resins. There was no statistically significant variation between Stellon, Acrylin-H and Trevalon, but variation was significantly higher with D (Trevalon "HI") vs. Stellon, Acrylin-H and Trevalon. Conclusion: The <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> denture base material D (Trevalon "HI") was the strongest and C (Trevalon) was the weakest among all materials used in this study.

This paper deals with the evaluation of the influence of the <b>heat</b> <b>curing</b> process on several concrete parameters. Four different types of samples, made of identical concrete composition, have been evaluated: - Concrete directly cast at the plant and stored in standard curing conditions. - Concrete made in the laboratory and stored in standard curing conditions. - Concretes cores extracted from a precast structure made in plant, after the <b>heat</b> <b>curing</b> process. - Concrete made in the laboratory, submitted to a <b>heat</b> <b>curing</b> process that reproduced the one carried out in the plant. The parameters evaluated in the four sample types were: mechanical properties, porosity, capillary suction coefficient, microstructure (using Back Scattered Electron Microscopy), and resistance against carbonation and against chloride penetration. The obtained results show that the <b>heat</b> <b>curing</b> process can be well reproduced in a laboratory scale giving a concrete with the same properties than those obtained in the concrete fabricated in the plant production rate. Regarding the results obtained in the concrete properties evaluated, first of all it must be said that the concrete mix studied showed a very good performance, exceeding the requirements defined for this type of concrete. Moreover, when comparing the obtained results with several durability indicators found in the literature, the concrete mix studied can be defined as a high durability material.

Flexural {{strength of}} samples was evaluated by 3 -point bending test. The results were analyzed with Two Way ANOVA Test. Results: Mean flexural strength of fiber reinforced samples immersed in disinfectant solution was 126. 5 Mpa, and in non reinforced samples immersed in disinfectant solution was 122. 7 Mpa. Mean flexural strength of all groups had no significant differences. Conclusion: The results showed this kind of fiber can not increase the flexural strength of acrylic resin samples. This method is not effective in strengthening of <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> acrylic resin in dry, wet condition and immersed in sodium hypochlorite solution.

40|$|Introduction: Bond Strengths among {{denture base}} resins and {{various types of}} reline {{materials}} are not always satisfactorily high. Therefore efforts {{have been made to}} use materials similar to resin base dentures and bonding agents to increase infirmity. This study compares bond strength and deflection of a hard chair side reline material with two denture base resins. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 54 resin specimens with the size of 65 × 10 × 2. 5 mm were prepared. These specimens included intact <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> (M), cold cure (F), acrylic resin specimens bonded with the same resins (M-M, F-F) and specimens bonded to a hard chair side reline material (M-G, F-G). All specimens were stored in sodium hypochlorite 8 hours a day for 3 months and were then thermocycled (2000 cycles, 5 to 55 °C). The transverse bond strengths (FMax) and deflections (DFMax) were evaluated with three point loading test. The results were analyzed with two-way ANOVA followed by Games Howell & Gabriel’s and Kolmogrov-smirnor test (α = 0. 05). Results: F Max for different types of resins and reline materials showed significant differences (p value < 0. 05). Although DFMax differences between reline materials and their interactions with different types of resins were significantly different (p value < 0. 05), no significant difference among the types of resins could be found (p value = 0. 263). Comparing the reline materials with denture base resins, cold cure resin was shown to have statistically different FMax and DFMax (p value < 0. 05). <b>Heat</b> <b>cure</b> resins showed statistical differences on FMax between intact resins when relined with the same resins and relined with hard reline (p value < 0. 05). Conclusion: Bond strength of the cold cure denture base resin group (F) to the same resin was higher than hard reline, but bond strength of hard reline material with <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> denture base was similar to the bond strength of the same reline, and in this group, maximum deflection in bonded resin with the same resins were showed.

40|$|Objectives: The {{absorption}} of water by acrylic resins {{is a phenomenon}} of considerable importance since it is accompanied by dimensional changes, a further undesirable effect of absorbed water in acrylic resins to reduce the tensile strength of the material. Solubility {{is also an important}} property because it represents the mass of soluble materials from the polymers. Methods: Ten acrylic resin-based materials were evaluated: two <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> acrylic resins (De Trey QC- 20, Meliodent <b>Heat</b> <b>Cure)</b> and eight self cure acrylic resins (Meliodent Cold, Akrileks, Akribel, Akribel Transparent, Vertex Trayplast, Formatray, Dentalon Plus, Palavit G). To evaluate water sorption and water solubility, thirty square-shaped specimens (20 x 20 x 1. 5 mm) were fabricated from the wax specimens. One way ANOVA test, Tukey test and Pearson correlation coefficient performed for data. Results: Water sorption mean values varied from 11. 33 ± 0. 33 to 30. 46 ± 0. 55 µg/mm 3. Water solubility mean values varied from- 0. 05 ± 0. 23 to 3. 69 ± 0. 12 µg/mm 3. There was statistically significant difference between mean values of the materials (P<. 05). There was no linear correlation between sorption and solubility values. Conclusions: The results of the water sorption and water solubility values of both self-cured and heat-cured acrylic resins were in accordance with the ISO specification. No correlation found between water sorption and water solubility values. (Eur J Dent 2008; 2 : 191 - 197...|$|E
40|$|Context: Bonding of {{artificial}} teeth and denture base material remained {{a significant problem}} for successful prosthetic treatment. Aim: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate shear bond strength of three different artificial teeth with <b>heat</b> <b>cure</b> denture base material after various surface conditioning methods and thermocycling. Materials and Methods: Ninety mandibular first molar denture teeth were selected. They were divided into three groups, Group I: Nanocomposite resin (Veracia), Group II: Composite teeth (Endura), and Group III: Cross-linked acrylic denture teeth (Acry rock). All groups were further subdivided into subgroups based on surface conditioning methods. Subgroup A: No surface conditioning (control group), Subgroup B: Surface conditioning with methyl methacrylate-based bonding agent (Vitacoll), and Subgroup C: Air abrasion with 50 μm aluminum oxide powder particles plus silane-coupling agent (Monobond-S) and Vitacoll bonding agent. Evaluation of shear bond strength of all the specimens was done using universal testing machine. Results: Mean shear bond strength of Group I, Subgroup B (6. 87 ± 0. 934) showed higher value when compared with Group II, Subgroup B (6. 76 ± 1. 84) and Group III, Subgroup B (5. 66 ± 2. 18). The control group (untreated surface) of all three types {{of artificial}} teeth {{used in this study}} showed significantly lower shear bond strength values than experimental groups (surface conditioning methods; P < 0. 05).

40|$|In {{the last}} few years it has been {{observed}} in Portugal, as well as in other countries worldwide, several cases of concrete structures affected by internal expansive reactions, particularly by delayed ettringite formation (DEF). This pathology, which is macroscopically characterized by the occurrence of cracks and fissures in concrete due to the expansion of the reaction product, is very difficult to deal with, because presently, there isn’t any efficient method to repair structures affected by DEF. Considering this, there is an urgent need to find preventive methods that may enable the inhibition of DEF in new concrete constructions. This paper presents the findings of a long-term study on the expansion rate and microstructure of <b>heat</b> <b>cured</b> concretes with different amounts of fly ash and metakaolin.
