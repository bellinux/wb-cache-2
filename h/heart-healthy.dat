5000|$|Chinook spawn {{in larger}} and deeper waters than other salmon species {{and can be}} found on the {{spawning}} redds (nests) from September to December. The female salmon may lay her eggs in four to five nesting pockets within a redd. After laying eggs, females guard the redd from four to 25 days before dying, while males seek additional mates. It has been observed that females are typically 98% successful at guarding their redds. Chinook eggs hatch, 90 to 150 days after deposition, depending upon water temperature. Egg deposits are timed to ensure the young salmon fry emerge during an appropriate season for survival and growth. Fry and parr (young fish) usually stay in fresh water 12 to 18 months before traveling downstream to estuaries, where they remain as smolts for several months. Some Chinooks return to the fresh water one or two years earlier than their counterparts, and are referred to as [...] "jack" [...] salmon. [...] "Jack" [...] salmon are typically less than 24 in long, but are sexually mature and return at an earlier age.The Yukon River has the longest freshwater migration route of any salmon, over 3000 km from its mouth in the Bering Sea to spawning grounds upstream of Whitehorse, Yukon.

The study compared mean values of 126 <b>heart-healthy</b> meals obtained from the American Heart Association Cookbook and four restaurants from the Chicagoland area to reported noon intakes of male and female participants between the ages of 18 to 74 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II, 1976 - 80). Noted nutritional composition of noon meals of participants were compared by sex and age catagories, and food sources. The <b>heart-healthy</b> meals contained significantly less calories, cholesterol, fat and sodium than contained in the meals consumed by male NHANES II participants no matter whether the meal was obtained from home, school, restaurant or other source. Female NHANES II participants consumed significantly less calories and cholesterol than contained in the <b>heart-healthy</b> meals but significantly more fat and sodium regardless of the food source. For males the caloric and cholesterol content of meals were associated with age. Younger men consumed more calories and cholesterol than older men. P/S ratio was significantly lower and percent of kcal from fat were significantly higher for the self-selected noon meal from NHANES II than <b>heart-healthy</b> meals for all groups compared. To reduce the risk of hypercholesterolemia, younger American males could reduce intake of total calories, cholesterol, fat and sodium by substituting a self-selected noon meal with a <b>heart-healthy</b> meal. If females from NHANES II substituted a <b>heart-healthy</b> meal for a self-selected noon meal they would increase calories and cholesterol but fat and sodium would be decreased. Overall the fat-related and sodium content of the <b>heart-healthy</b> meals were more conducive to reduce the risk of hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. Therefore, <b>heart-healthy</b> meals served at some restaurants should be brought to the attention of the public. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E

40|$|The {{number one}} killer {{of women in}} the United States is {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD). Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) include advancing age, cigarette smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia, family history, hypertension, obesity, sedentary lifestyle and high intake of saturated fats and low dietary fiber. A women’s risk for development of CVD dramatically increases after menopause and with the number of CVRFs. CVD is often preventable. Evidence supports addressing CVRFs reduction early (in the pre-menopausal years) through <b>heart-healthy</b> behaviors such as increasing physical activity, promoting healthy eating, moderate alcohol consumption and not smoking. Therefore, understanding premenopausal women’s CVRFs knowledge is an important area of inquiry. In addition, the Nemcek Wellness Model suggests that self-nurturance, as well as knowledge, may be an important factor for explaining women’s wellness behaviors. Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate knowledge of CVRFs, level of self-nurturance and the performance of <b>heart-healthy</b> behaviors in women ages 35 to 55 years. This study used a cross sectional survey design and venue sampling. The survey included demographic questions, the Self Nurturance Survey, the Heart Disease Facts Questionnaire, the Physical Activity Questionnaire, Prime Screen, and questions about financial strain, cigarette smoking, and alcohol use. The sample included 136 women (survey response rate = 57 %), the majority of whom were white (94. 9 %), married (80. 1 %), did not smoke (80. 1 %) and rarely drank alcohol (57. 4 %). Results indicated that study participants were very knowledgeable about CVRFs. (Mean knowledge score = 19. 53, possible range = 0 to 25 with higher scores indicating greater knowledge). Knowledge did not predict physical activity (p =. 07), diet (p =. 08) or smoking status (p =. 11) in this sample. Self-nurturance was moderately correlated (r =. 33) with consuming a <b>heart-healthy</b> diet. Hypotheses derived from the Nemcek Wellness Model were not supported in this study.

The cost of heart disease and stroke in the United States is projected to be 394 billion in 2005, of which 242 billion is for health care expenditures and 152 billion for lost productivity from death and disability. The costs, the disability, and the deaths will only increase as the baby-boomer generation ages and its age-dependent risks for heart disease and stroke increase. Heart disease and stroke are largely preventable. Years of research have indicated that controlling high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol reduces a person 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s risk of developing heart disease or having a heart attack or stroke.

Promoting <b>heart-healthy</b> and stroke-free communities involves efforts from all sectors of society. Health care systems, state and local governments, and workplaces have important and distinct roles to play in improving cardiovascular health. Health care organizations can implement systems to better monitor and manage cardiovascular conditions in accordance with national guidelines.
