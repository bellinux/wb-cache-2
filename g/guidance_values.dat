40|$|AbstractSince 2007, the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) {{has been}} {{collecting}} biomonitoring {{data from the}} general Canadian population and has provided, to date, nationally representative concentrations for hundreds of environmental biomarkers in blood or urine. Biomonitoring Equivalents (BEs) have been developed as tools to help interpret biomonitoring data in a health risk context at a population level. In this paper, BEs are used to relate biomonitoring data from the CHMS (2007 – 2011) to existing exposure <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> developed by Health Canada and other government agencies. Chemical-specific hazard quotients (HQs) and/or cancer risk estimates are calculated using existing BEs corresponding to environmental chemicals analyzed in the CHMS. For the majority of environmental chemicals, calculated HQ values are less than 1 indicating exposure is below published exposure <b>guidance</b> <b>values.</b> Individual biomonitoring data for two biomarkers of metal exposure (inorganic arsenic and cadmium) resulted in HQ values exceeding 1 suggesting that exposure may be above existing <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> {{for a portion of}} the population, at least intermittently.

Hazard identification and characterization aim to identify the metabolism and elimination of the chemical (toxicokinetics) and the toxicological dose-response (toxicodynamics) and to derive a health-based <b>guidance</b> <b>value</b> for safe levels of exposure. Exposure assessment estimates human exposure {{as the product of}} the amount of the chemical in the matrix consumed and the consumption itself. Finally, risk characterization evaluates the risk of the exposure to human health by comparing the latter to with the health-based <b>guidance</b> <b>value.</b> Recently, many research efforts in computational toxicology have been put together to characterize population variability and uncertainty in each of the steps of {{risk assessment}} to move towards more quantitative and transparent risk assessment. This chapter focuses specifically on modeling population variability and effects for each step of risk assessment in order to provide an overview of the statistical and computational tools available to toxicologists and risk assessors.

Screening-level chemical risk assessment evaluations consider both exposure and hazard. Exposures are increasingly being evaluated through biomonitoring studies in humans.

40|$|Government {{agencies}} {{charged with}} the protection of public health, such as the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), and the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), must have a reference, or comparison value, upon which to base an evaluation of potential health threat posed by any substance or chemical. The basis, or starting points, for such evaluations may have different names or acronyms, but represent {{more or less the}} same thing. These values for non-carcinogenic endpoints are called oral Reference Doses (RIDs) and inhalation Reference Concentrations (RfCs) by the USEPA, Acceptable Daily Intakes (ADIs) by the FDA, and oral and inhalation Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs) by the ATSDR. Too often, however, RIDs, Rfes, MRLs, and ADIs are construed as rigid, threshold limits, above which toxicity is likely to occur. The truth, however, is that these values actually represent levels of a potential toxicant that are highly unlikely to represent any threat to human health over a particular/specified duration of daily exposures. The more frequently these levels are exceeded and the greater the exceedance, the more likely some toxic manifestation is to occur. These guidance/reference values are most definitely not threshold values for the onset of toxicity in any exposed popu lation.

It is mainly found in grain {{but it can}} also be found in other products of plant origin like beans, fruits, vegetables and fruit juices, herbs and spices an tainted dairy products. In a recent biomonitoring study of multiple mycotoxins in the Belgian population low concentrations of citrinin were frequently detected. The Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) monitors the occurrence of mycotoxins in the Netherlands and advises the Dutch government on the food safety risks related to mycotoxins. In 2012 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published an opinion where it was reported that due to limitations and uncertainties in the toxicity database (especially genotoxicity and carcinogenicity), the derivation of a health-based <b>guidance</b> <b>value</b> that would cover all possible adverse outcomes of citrinin was not considered appropriate. Nonetheless, a health-based <b>guidance</b> <b>value</b> was set on the highest dosage of a 90 -day general toxicity study (not covering specific endpoints, for example carcinogenicity, developmental effects) because no effects were reported. In this report a new literature search was performed to find out whether new toxicity studies have been published (2011 to 2015). And secondly, if new toxicity studies could be used to derive a benchmark dose or a health-based <b>guidance</b> <b>value.</b> The literature search produced 38 new toxicity articles on citrinin, where seven of these studies contained in vivo animal tests. Two of the seven studies were suitable for BMD analysis. The lowest BMDL of 48 µg/kg bw/day obtained from the endpoint ‘decreased crown rump length’ from the Singh study is considered as the appropriate point of departure for risk assessment. This BMDL is 2. 4 times higher than the (conservative estimate of the) NOAEL determined by EFSA in 2012. There are no new scientific articles available on the in vivo genotoxicity or carcinogenicity of citrinin. A re-evaluation of an article published in 1983 on the tumorigenicity of citrinin in rats revealed that the study was not suitable for BMD analysis. Therefore, we agree with EFSA’s concern regarding the genotoxicity and/or carcinogenicity of citrinin and EFSA’s request for a well-designed toxicological study in laboratory animals to further explore the carcinogenic potential of citrinin...|$|R

Until 1993 a <b>guidance</b> <b>value</b> for assessing exposure in coke ovens only, where PAH exposure {{is known to be}} the highest, was based on gravimetric analysis of cyclohexane-soluble material.

Airborne benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) correlated well (r 2 = 0. 971) with levels of carcinogenic 4 – 6 ring PAHs and was an effective marker of exposure for all industries where significant particle bound PAH levels were found and, in particular, for CTPV exposure...|$|R

This review describes the concept and implementation of Biomonitoring Equivalents (BEs), estimates of the concentration of a chemical or metabolite in a biological medium {{that is consistent with}} an existing exposure <b>guidance</b> <b>value</b> such as a tolerable daily intake or reference dose. The BE approach integrates available pharmacokinetic data to convert an existing exposure <b>guidance</b> <b>value</b> into an equivalent concentration in a biological medium.

These case studies demonstrate that a range of pharmacokinetic data and approaches can be used to derive BE values; fully developed physiologically based pharmacokinetic models, while useful, are not required. The resulting screening level evaluation can be used to classify these compounds into relative categories of low, medium and high priority for risk assessment follow-up. Future challenges related to the derivation and use of BE values as tools in risk management are discussed...|$|R

In 2005, the German Stiftung Warentest (a product testing NGO) had detected high levels of PAHs in some tool handles and cable sheaths [1]. To reduce the health risks, <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> for technically unavoidable PAH levels were proposed for manufacturers to comply on a voluntary basis. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) was asked to assess these <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> and the occurrence of PAHs in consumer products.

Materials and Methods: Twenty subjects in the age group of 19 - 35 years, free from temporomandibular joint dysfunction, and occlusal disharmony, with healthy dentition participated in the study. Hanau H 2 (non-arcon type) and Hanau Wide-Vue (arcon type) articulators were programmed for sagittal condylar <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> using the same protrusive record made in polysiloxane bite registration material with edge to edge degree of protrusion.

The tabulated data were subjected to statistical analysis, ANOVA (Fishers ′F′ test) for group comparison, Tukey′s HSD test for inter-comparison, student′s unpaired ′t′ test for intra-group comparison, and level of significance (P) was calculated using the same. Results: The mean sagittal condylar <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> of the three different groups were found to be very highly significant (P= 0. 001) and highly significant (P= 0. 002) on the right and left sides respectively. There was a very highly significant difference (P= 0. 001) and highly significant difference (P= 0. 003) between the arcon and non-arcon group on the right and left side respectively. No significant difference was found between the arcon and cephalometric group (P= 0. 284 right, P= 0. 853 left) and a statistically significant difference was found between the non-arcon and cephalometric group (P= 0. 049 right, P= 0. 015 left).
