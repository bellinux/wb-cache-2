5|$|Women {{from within}} the Black Lives Matter, {{including}} professor and civil rights advocate Treva B. Lindsey, have argued that BLM has sidelined black women's experiences in favor of black men's experiences. For example, some argue that more protests have been organized around the <b>killings</b> <b>of</b> Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin than around the <b>killings</b> <b>of</b> Kayla Moore or Rekia Boyd.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{shooting}} of two police officers in Ferguson {{and in response to}} BLM, the hashtag #BlueLivesMatter was created by supporters of the police. Following this, Blue Lives Matter became a pro-police officer movement in the United States. It expanded after the <b>killings</b> <b>of</b> American police officers.|$|E
5|$|In July, Eric Garner died in New York City, after a New York City Police Department officer {{put him in}} a chokehold while arresting him. Garner's {{death has}} been cited as one of several police <b>killings</b> <b>of</b> African Americans that sparked the Black Lives Matter movement.|$|E
50|$|Both the First and the Supplementary Report's {{findings}} {{accused the}} Pakistan Army {{of carrying out}} the senseless and wanton arson, killings in the countryside, <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> intellectuals and professionals and burying them in mass graves, <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> officers of East Pakistan Army and soldiers on the pretence of quelling their rebellion, killing East Pakistani civilian officers, businessmen and industrialists, raping {{a large number of}} East Pakistani women as a deliberate act of revenge, retaliation and torture, and deliberate <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> members of the Hindu minority.|$|R

5|$|M.I.A. {{has also}} been outspoken about the police <b>killings</b> <b>of</b> {{citizens}} in the United States. On 12 July 2016 she posted an article to Twitter showing that more US citizens {{have been killed by}} police than military personnel since 11 September 2001.|$|E
5|$|On 15 March 1314 the <b>killings</b> <b>of</b> Francis de Petriolo, Monaldo of Ancona and Anthony of Milan {{occurred}} in China. This {{was followed by}} the Killing of James, Quanzhou's bishop, in 1362. His predecessors were Andrew, Peregrinus, and Gerard.|$|E
5|$|Arafat {{established}} a Palestinian police force, named the Preventive Security Service (PSS), that became active on 13 May. It was mainly composed of PLA soldiers and foreign Palestinian volunteers. Arafat assigned Mohammed Dahlan and Jibril Rajoub {{to head the}} PSS.

50|$|Al-Yaqoubi condemns ISIS's {{treatment}} of prisoners as unlawful {{according to the}} Sharia. He claims that the mutilation of prisoners' bodies was ruled impermissible in a prophetic Hadith. Similarly, he argues that torture with fire, the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> prisoners who had converted to Islam, the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> innocents, and the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> foreigners who had entered Muslim lands under the security of Muslims, are all expressly forbidden under Islamic Law.|$|R
25|$|The 1988 Polish film, And the Violins Stopped Playing, {{also has}} Porajmos as its subject. It {{was criticized for}} showing the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> Roma {{as a method of}} {{removing}} witnesses to the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> Jews.|$|R
5000|$|... "Until the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> black men, black mothers' sons, becomes as {{important}} {{to the rest of the}} country as the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> a white mother's son, we who believe in freedom cannot rest until this happens." [...] (1964) ...|$|R
5|$|By 2009, the commission's work of {{collating}} declassified U.S. military documents with survivors' accounts confirmed eight representative {{cases of}} what it found were wrongful U.S. <b>killings</b> <b>of</b> hundreds of South Korean civilians, including refugees crowded into a cave attacked with napalm bombs, and those at a shoreline refugee encampment deliberately shelled by a U.S. warship.|$|E
5|$|In December, 2,000–3,000 people {{gathered}} at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, to protest the <b>killings</b> <b>of</b> unarmed black men by police. At least twenty members of a protest that had been using the slogan were arrested. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, BLM protested the police shooting of Dontre Hamilton, who died in April. Black Lives Matter protested the shooting of John Crawford III. The shooting of Renisha McBride was protested by Black Lives Matter.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{crimes in}} the area include the Ratcliff Highway murders (1813); the killings {{committed}} by the London Burkers (apparently inspired by Burke and Hare) in Bethnal Green (1831); the notorious serial <b>killings</b> <b>of</b> prostitutes by Jack the Ripper (1888); and the Siege of Sidney Street (1911) (in which anarchists, inspired by the legendary Peter the Painter, took on Home Secretary Winston Churchill, and the army).|$|E
50|$|In 1994, Maurizio Avola, {{a nephew}} of Santapaola, confessed the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> Fava, {{and became a}} pentito. He also confessed some 70 other murders. Avola said that his uncle Nitto Santapaola had ordered the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> the journalist.|$|R
50|$|Verdoux {{is exposed}} and convicted of murder. Before being {{led to the}} guillotine, he dismisses his <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> a few, for {{which he has been}} condemned, as no worse than the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> many in war, for which others are honored.|$|R
50|$|The 1842 {{massacre}} of 100 Bundjalung Nation tribes-people at Evans Head by Europeans, was variously {{said to have}} been in retaliation for the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> 'a few sheep', or the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> 'five European men' from the 1842 'Pelican Creek tragedy'.|$|R
5|$|The ACLU {{has also}} criticized {{targeted}} <b>killings</b> <b>of</b> American citizens who {{fight against the}} United States. In 2011 the ACLU criticized the killing of radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki {{on the basis that}} it was a violation of his Fifth Amendment right to not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{left the}} Centralia area on September 27, pursued {{for the first}} time by Union forces {{equipped}} with artillery. Anderson evaded the pursuit, leading his men into ravines that the Union troops would not enter for fear of ambush. In the aftermath of the attacks, Union soldiers committed several revenge <b>killings</b> <b>of</b> Confederate-sympathizing civilians. They burned Rocheport to the ground on October 2; the town was under close scrutiny by Union forces, owing to the number of Confederate sympathizers there, but General Fisk maintained that the fire was accidental. Anderson watched the fire from nearby bluffs.|$|E
5|$|Black also learns of {{the murder}} in Maryland, and connects it to the <b>killings</b> <b>of</b> four {{other women in the}} locale. Ignoring the protestations of his wife, Black leaves to {{investigate}} the parkland where one of the earlier bodies was uncovered. A park ranger discusses that case with him, telling Black that the body was found by an unidentified rambler. Black believes this man was the murderer. Elsewhere, Dion returns home, where he is belittled and emasculated by his overbearing mother, Marie (Linda Sorensen).|$|E
5000|$|The trial {{influenced}} Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin, {{who later}} {{reflected on the}} trial, [...] "Why is a man punished when he kills another man? Why is the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> a million a lesser crime than the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> a single individual?" ...|$|R
2500|$|He {{imposed a}} ban on <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> [...] "all four-footed creatures that are neither useful nor edible", and of {{specific}} animal species including several birds, certain types of fish and bulls among others. He also banned <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> female goats, sheep and pigs that were nursing their young; {{as well as their}} young up to the age of six months.

40|$|Time-kill studies {{examined}} {{the activities of}} telithromycin (HMR 3647), erythromycin A, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, clindamycin, pristinamycin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and metronidazole against 11 gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Time-kill {{studies were carried out}} with the addition of Oxyrase in order to prevent the introduction of CO 2. Macrolide-azalide-ketolide MICs were 0. 004 to 32. 0 μg/ml. Of the latter group, telithromycin had the lowest MICs, especially against non-Bacteroides fragilis group strains, followed by azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin A, and roxithromycin. Clindamycin was active (MIC ≤ 2. 0 μg/ml) against all anaerobes except Peptostreptococcus magnus and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, while pristinamycin MICs were 0. 06 to 4. 0 μg/ml. Amoxicillin-clavulanate had MICs of ≤ 1. 0 μg/ml, while metronidazole was active (MICs, 0. 03 to 2. 0 μg/ml) against all except Propionibacterium acnes. After 48 h at twice the MIC, telithromycin was bactericidal (≥ 99. 9 % killing) against 6 strains, with 99 % <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> 9 strains and 90 % <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> 10 strains. After 24 h at twice the MIC, 90, 99, and 99. 9 % <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> nine, six, and three strains, respectively, occurred. Lower rates <b>of</b> <b>killing</b> were seen at earlier times. Similar kill kinetics relative to the MIC were seen with other macrolides. After 48 h at the MIC, clindamycin was bactericidal against 8 strains, with 99 and 90 % <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> 9 and 10 strains, respectively. After 24 h, 90 % <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> 10 strains occurred at the MIC. The kinetics of clindamycin were similar to those of pristinamycin. After 48 h at the MIC, amoxicillin-clavulanate showed 99. 9 % <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> seven strains, with 99 % <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> eight strains and 90 % <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> nine strains. At four times the MIC, metronidazole was bactericidal against 8 of 10 strains tested after 48 h and against all 10 strains after 24 h; after 12 h, 99 % <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> all 10 strains occurred...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{having left}} TNA in June 2007, Konnan did not wrestle for AAA until October, and only {{wrestled}} in four matches during {{the remainder of}} the year, due to his aforementioned surgeries. Konnan returned to World Wrestling Council at WWC Euphoria Tour 2008 on January 6, 2008, with Ron <b>Killings</b> <b>of</b> the 3LiveKru, losing a tag team match against Eddy and Orlando Colon. In March 2008, Konnan sued TNA for racism and discrimination, alleging that while the company said that they would help pay for his hip replacement surgery, they did not. Konnan also claimed that TNA helped pay for Scott Steiner's operation, but did not pay for Ron Killings's surgery from around the same time.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Republika Srpska {{authorities}} charged seven Bosnian Croat {{officials and}} HVO officers with the <b>killings</b> <b>of</b> 19 Serb civilians and 20 {{members of the}} Bosnian Serb TO {{in the area of}} Kupres in 1992. The charges also pertained to the abuse of 18 prisoners of war captured in the Battle of Kupres. In 2013, Croatian authorities in Šibenik charged 21 former members of the JNA with the abuse of 23 HVO prisoners of war. The charges specify that the prisoners were detained and abused in Knin prison between 24 April and 14 May. The abuse is alleged to have caused the deaths of two of the prisoners and grave injuries to three others.|$|E
5|$|Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour {{addresses}} the wizarding media, and {{states that the}} Ministry will remain strong, even as Lord Voldemort gains strength. The Death Eaters have made major gains after Dumbledore's death, committing mass <b>killings</b> <b>of</b> Muggles and infiltrating the Ministry itself. Harry, Ron, and Hermione set out to complete the mission Dumbledore gave Harry by hunting down and destroying Voldemort's Horcruxes. Meanwhile, Severus Snape informs Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters of Harry's impending departure from Privet Drive. Voldemort commandeers Lucius Malfoy's wand, as Voldemort's own wand cannot be used to kill Harry because they share the same core.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> Meir Lixenberg, {{councillor}} {{and head}} of security in four settlements, who was shot while travelling in his car in the West Bank on 27 August 2001. PFLP claimed {{that this was a}} retaliation for the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> Abu Ali Mustafa.|$|R
5000|$|... 9. Extermination: The <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> {{an entire}} group. This term is most {{commonly}} {{used to describe the}} <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> an entire group of animals or insects, but in this essay it, describes the measure certain humans felt must be done onto other humans.|$|R
5|$|The killings were publicised in 1997, when {{a wartime}} member of Autumn Rains {{paramilitary}} {{spoke about the}} unit's involvement in <b>killings</b> <b>of</b> civilians in Gospić in an interview to the Feral Tribune. No formal investigation was launched until 2000, after three former Croatian intelligence and military police officers informed the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia about the killings. Five, including Orešković and Norac, were arrested in 2001 and tried. Orešković, Norac and Stjepan Grandić were found {{guilty of the crime}} and sentenced to 14, 12 and 10 years in prison respectively in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} at Kraljevo, {{as well as}} a similar and nearly concurrent massacre in nearby Kragujevac, convinced German commanders that mass <b>killings</b> <b>of</b> Serbian hostages were not only ineffectual but also counterproductive, as they drove locals into the hands of insurgents and sometimes resulted in the deaths of factory workers contributing to the German war effort. Following the war, several senior German military officials were tried and convicted for their involvement in the reprisal shootings at the Nuremberg Trials and the Subsequent Nuremberg trials.|$|E
5|$|Ustaše <b>killings</b> <b>of</b> Serbs {{continued}} {{throughout the}} war, and concentration camps were established to detain Serbs, Jews, Gypsies, anti-fascist Croats and others opposed to Pavelić's regime. Contemporary German accounts place {{the number of}} Serbs killed by the Ustaše at about 350,000. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, between 320,000 and 340,000 Serbs {{were killed by the}} Ustaše {{over the course of the}} war. Most modern historians agree that the Ustaše killed over 300,000 Serbs, or about 17 percent of all Serbs living in the NDH. At the Nuremberg trials, these killings were judged to have constituted genocide.|$|E
50|$|On December 27, 2005, Francesco Cataldo, who is {{considered}} to be the acting boss of the clan since the imprisonment of Giuseppe Cataldo, was arrested alone in a deserted house and unarmed. He was charged with commanding the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> Salvatore Cordì on May 31, 2005, the leader of the opposing clan. The <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> Salvatore Cordì was a retribution for the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> the younger Giuseppe Cataldo, the namesake nephew of the clan's boss, three months earlier, on February 15, 2005.|$|R
5000|$|He {{earned the}} name Hundingsbane by slaying Hunding, {{the king of}} Saxony, and conquered Jutland from the Saxons and {{entrusted}} it to his commanders Heske, Eyr and Ler.

40|$|Despite the {{continued}} importance of tuberculosis as a world-wide threat to public health, {{little is known}} about the mechanisms used by human lymphocytes to contain and kill the intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We previously described an in vitro model of infection of human monocytes (MN) with virulent M. tuberculosis strain H 37 Rv in which the ability of peripheral blood lymphocytes to limit intracellular growth of the organism could be measured. In the current study, we determined that lymphocyte-mediated <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> intracellular M. tuberculosis occurs within the first 24 h of coculture with infected MN. Natural killer (NK) cells isolated from both purified protein derivative (PPD) -positive and PPD-negative subjects were capable of mediating this early <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> intracellular H 37 Rv. NK cell-mediated <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> intracellular M. tuberculosis was not associated with the production of gamma interferon. Transferred supernatants of cocultured NK cells and M. tuberculosis-infected MN could not mediate the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> intracellular M. tuberculosis, and Transwell studies indicated that direct cell-to-cell contact was required for NK cells to mediate the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> the organism. Killing was not dependent upon exocytosis of NK cell cytotoxic granules. NK cells induced apoptosis of mycobacterium-infected MN, but neither <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> intracellular M. tuberculosis by NK cells nor NK cell-induced apoptosis of infected MN was inhibited by blocking the interaction of FasL and Fas. Thus, human NK cells may mediate <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> intracellular M. tuberculosis via alternative apoptotic pathways...|$|R
