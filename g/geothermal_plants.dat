25|$|Currently, {{there are}} two {{geothermal}} facilities in operation in El Salvador, the 95MW Ahuachapan, and the 66MW Berlin plant. Majority state-owned power company LaGeo, formerly Gesal, operates the two plants. LaGeo is currently expanding the two existing <b>geothermal</b> <b>plants,</b> as well as conducting a feasibility study for a third plant, Cuyanausul. It is expected that the three projects add 64 MW of installed electric generation capacity by 2007.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} catalyst behind new industry activity is the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This Act made new <b>geothermal</b> <b>plants</b> {{eligible for the}} full federal production tax credit, previously available only to wind power projects and certain kinds of biomass. It also authorized and directed increased funding for research by the Department of Energy, and enabled the Bureau of Land Management to address its backlog of geothermal leases and permits.|$|E

25|$|The larger of two {{operating}} <b>geothermal</b> <b>plants</b> is the Momotombo geothermal project, whose {{commercial exploitation}} started in 1983, {{when the first}} geothermal unit of 35MW was put in operation. The second unit of 35MW was installed in 1989. However, mismanagement of the exploitation led to declines in output levels down to 10MW. It is expected that {{with the implementation of}} a reinjection program and the exploitation of a deeper reservoir, production will increase from the current 20MW to 75 MW.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, a {{large share}} of Iran's natural gas {{reserves}} were untapped. The addition of new hydroelectric stations and the streamlining of conventional coal and oil-fired stations increased installed capacity to 33,000 megawatts. Of that amount, about 75% was based on natural gas, 18% on oil, and 7% on hydroelectric power. In 2004, Iran opened its first wind-powered and <b>geothermal</b> <b>plants,</b> and the first solar thermal plant was to come online in 2009. Iran is the world's third country to have developed GTL technology.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{renewable}} power {{sources such as}} wind and solar, geothermal energy is dispatchable, meaning that it is both available whenever needed, and can quickly adjust output to match demand. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), {{of all types of}} new electrical generation plants, geothermal generators have the highest capacity factor, a measure of how much power a facility actually generates as a percent of its maximum capacity. The EIA rates new <b>geothermal</b> <b>plants</b> as having a 92% capacity factor, comparable to those of nuclear (90%), and higher than gas (87%), or coal (85%), and much higher than those of intermittent sources such as onshore wind (34%) or solar photovoltaic (25%). While the carrier medium for geothermal electricity (water) must be properly managed, the source of geothermal energy, the Earth's heat, will be available, for most intents and purposes, indefinitely.|$|E

30|$|The maximum PS-InSAR {{displacement}} for {{points in}} {{the proximity of the}} <b>geothermal</b> <b>plant</b> for the July 2013 to March 2014 time period reaches 4  cm in the LOS direction in the north-south profile and 4.2  cm in the west-east southern profile (Figure  2). Note that the PS-InSAR displacement at the <b>geothermal</b> power <b>plant</b> indicates a cumulative displacement of less than 3.3  cm. This value likely reflects error during the phase unwrapping procedure rather than real behaviour as the region near the <b>geothermal</b> <b>plant</b> contains sparse coherent PS and SAR acquisitions during the period of maximum deformation. Subsequently, at the <b>geothermal</b> <b>plant,</b> PS-InSAR underestimates the real deformation, as shown in the Comparison between InSAR and levelling section for the levelling observations.|$|R

[...] Return on investments into geothermal power are not as quick as those into fossil fuels and may take years to pay off, however, low maintenance cost and the renewable nature of geothermal energy means more benefits in the long term.|$|E
