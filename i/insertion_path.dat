40|$|In this paper, {{we will be}} {{considering}} a new definition of infinite strings over a finite alphabet. The conventional definition of a finite string does not involve the process of string formation but implicity assumes that the strings are formed by insertions of letters at the end, which results in a definition of an infinite sequence of letters. This definition is incomplete, because other processes of formation of finite strings exist and lead to alternate formations of infinite strings. We will represent a finite string s first by a sequence of insertions of letters that starts from an initially empty string and constructs s and call the string constructed in this way an insertion string. We introduce a topology {{on the set of}} finite insertion strings. Then, we consider infinite sequences of insertions of letters, called <b>insertion</b> <b>paths,</b> and define two such <b>insertion</b> <b>paths</b> to be equivalent if and only if they belong to the same open sets. An equivalence class of infinite <b>insertion</b> <b>paths</b> will be called an infinite insertion string. We define the concepts of ancestors and descendants for infinite <b>insertion</b> <b>paths</b> and introduce a criterion for the equivalence of infinite <b>insertion</b> paths: <b>paths</b> p 1 and p 2 are equivalent if and only if p 1 is an ancestor and descendant of p 2. This criterion allows us to find a canonical representative path in each infinite insertion string and show that the set of all infinite insertion strings is countable. 1...|$|R

40|$|Insertion velocity, tip asymmetry, {{and shaft}} {{diameter}} may influence steerable needle <b>insertion</b> <b>paths</b> in soft tissue. In this paper {{we examine the}} effects of these variables on needle paths in ex vivo goat liver, and demonstrate practical applications of robotic needle steering for ablation, biopsy, and brachytherapy. All experiments were performed using a new portable needle steering robot that steers asymmetric-tip needles under fluoroscopic imaging. For bevel-tip needles, we found that larger diameter needles resulted in less curvature, i. e. less steerability, confirming previous experiments in artificial tissue. The needles steered with radii of curvature ranging from 3 : 4 cm (for the most steerable pre-bent needle) to 2 : 97 m (for the least steerable bevel needle). Pre-bend angle significantly affected needle curvature, but bevel angle did not. We hypothesize that biological tissue characteristics such as inhomogeneity and viscoelasticity significantly increase path variability. These results underscore the need for closed-loop image guidance for needle steering in biological tissues with complex internal structure. I...|$|R

The analysis focuses on the immigrants' school participation in the secondary school, considering also the first and the second generation. The data has been extracted from official statistical databases, mainly of the Ministry of Education and Istat (Italian National Statistics Institute). The analysis points out that the participation rates of foreign students in the secondary school are lower than those of the Italian students and both of them are different among regions and provinces. Five territorial areas are distinguished through some social and economic indicators (sectoral added value and number of industrial districts) in order to show the determinants of different participation rates between foreign and Italian students. A multivariate analysis by territorial areas reveals that the main factors affecting the education choices are related to the local characteristics and the economic variables, such as total families' income and gross national product (GNP) per capita.

Simulation results and experiments show that the four DoF in-sertions can improve over two DoF insertions. Moreover, changing the angle of approach can further reduce the insertion forces.

METHODS: Using high-resolution ultrasonography, we measured the distances between the medial recess of the intercostal spaces (ICSs) around the mid-clavicular line (MCL) and the lung margin. We performed measurements bilaterally during quiet breathing in the seated and supine positions. RESULTS: We studied 10 young healthy men and found that, in the first ICS with the medial recess clearly (i. e., several cm) lateral to MCL (usually the eighth ICS), the distance between the recommended insertion site and the lung margin varied from 7. 5 to 17 cm.

40|$|Purpose To {{study the}} ability of a human {{operator}} to manually correct for errors in the needle <b>insertion</b> <b>path</b> without partial withdrawal of the needle by means of an active, tip-articulated steerable needle. Materials and Methods The needle is composed of a 1. 32 -mm outer-diameter cannula, with a flexure joint near the tip, and a retractable stylet. The bending stiffness of the needle resembles that of a 20 -gauge hypodermic needle. The needle functionality was evaluated in manual insertions by steering to predefined targets and a lateral displacement of 20 mm from the straight insertion line. Steering tasks were conducted in 5 directions and 2 tissue simulants under image guidance from a camera. The repeatability in instrument actuations was assessed during 100 mm deep automated insertions with a linear motor. In addition to tip position, tip angles were tracked during the insertions. Results The targeting error (mean absolute error ± standard deviation) during manual steering to 5 different targets in stiff tissue was 0. 5 mm ± 1. 1. This variability in manual tip placement (1. 1 mm) was less than the variability among automated insertions (1. 4 mm) in the same tissue type. An increased tissue stiffness resulted in an increased lateral tip displacement. The tip angle was directly controlled by the user interface, and remained unaffected by the tissue stiffness.

Percutaneous needle procedures are mostly carried out with the guidance of 2 D ultrasound (US) imaging. US images are inherently noisy and their resolutions are low. Hence, target tracking can be challenging. Image based tracking methods can be used to track the needle and the target. This paper proposes visual tracking of multiple moving points, such as biopsy needles and targets, in 2 D US images using normalized cross correlation and mutual information similarity functions. Both moving and deformable targets can be tracked. An affine motion model is used for small and moving target tracking and a thin plate spline motion model is used for deformable target tracking. During the tracking, needle and target template images are updated with a template update strategy. Also, tracking outputs of normalized cross correlation and mutual information are fused using the Kalman filter to reduce the tracking error. During the experiments, needle is inserted using a needle insertion robot. 2 D US probe is attached to a robotic arm's end effector to servo the probe along the needle <b>insertion</b> <b>path.</b> Proposed needle and target tracking methods were tested with phantoms.
