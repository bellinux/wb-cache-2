40|$|The front {{texture of}} {{crystalline}} silicon solar cells plays {{a crucial role}} in order to effectively harvest light and transform it into electricity. In this paper, a novel technology based on <b>dry</b> <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure</b> etching is presented. It allows the single-sided inline etching of c-Si wafers using the global warming potential-free process gas fluorine (F 2). Vast improvements of light trapping are already achieved leading to weighted reflection values below 8 % without dielectric anti-reflection coating. The passivation of the relatively rough surfaces can most effectively be facilitated using ALD-Al 2 O 3 films stacked with PECVD-SiNx layers. The paper presents SEM images of the surface structures and the basic setup principle of the new production tool...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, {{increasingly}} sophisticated deep space missions have placed correspondingly stringent requirements on navigational accuracy. As {{part of the effort}} to increase navigational accuracy, and hence the quality of radiometric data, much effort has been expended in an attempt to understand and compute the tropospheric effect on range (and hence range rate) data. The general approach adopted has been that of computing a zenith range refraction, and then mapping this refraction to any arbitrary elevation angle via an empirically derived function of elevation. The prediction of zenith range refraction derived from surface measurements of meteorological parameters is presented. Refractivity is separated into wet (water vapor pressure) and <b>dry</b> (<b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure)</b> components. The integration of dry refractivity is shown to be exact. Attempts to integrate wet refractivity directly prove ineffective; however, several empirical models developed by the author and other researchers at JPL are discussed. The best current wet refraction model is here considered to be a separate day/night model, which is proportional to surface water vapor pressure and inversely proportional to surface temperature. Methods are suggested that might improve the accuracy of the wet range refraction model...|$|E
40|$|A parallel-plate {{differential}} mobility analyzer and a time-of-flight {{mass spectrometer}} (DMA-MS) {{are used in}} series to measure true mobility in <b>dry</b> <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure</b> air for mass-resolved electrosprayed GroEL tetradecamers (14 -mers; ~ 800 kDa). Narrow mobility peaks are found (2. 6 - 2. 9 % fwhm); hence, precise mobilities can be obtained for these ions without collisional activation, just following their generation by electrospray ionization. In contrast to previous studies, two conformers are found with mobilities (Z) differing by ~ 5 % at charge state z ~ 79. By extrapolating to small z, a common mobility/charge ratio Z(0) /z = 0. 0117 cm(2) V(- 1) s(- 1) is found for both conformers. When interpreted as if the GroEL ion surface were smooth and the gas molecule-protein collisions were perfectly elastic and specular, this mobility yields an experimental collision cross section, Ω, 11 % smaller than in an earlier measurement, {{and close to the}} cross section, A(C,crystal), expected for the crystal structure (determined by a geometric approximation). However, the similarity between Ω and A(C,crystal) does not imply a coincidence between the native and gas-phase structures. The nonideal nature of protein-gas molecule collisions introduces a drag enhancement factor, ξ = 1. 36, with which the true cross section A(C) is related to Ω via A(C) = Ω/ξ. Therefore, A(C) for GroEL 14 -mer ions determined by DMA measurements is 0. 69 A(C,crystal). The factor 1. 36 used here is based on the experimental Stokes-Millikan equation, as well as on prior and new numerical modeling accounting for multiple scattering events via exact hard-sphere scattering calculations. Therefore, we conclude that the gas-phase structure of the GroEL complex as electrosprayed is substantially more compact than the corresponding X-ray crystal structure...|$|E

30|$|Heating {{wood with}} high temperature, {{especially}} {{up to the}} boiling point, {{is believed to be}} a rapid method for drying. High temperature causes steam pressure, which leads to accelerate a water movement along the grain direction due to capillary force [21]. Pressure steam and microwave irradiation can be a drying method that rise inside temperature quickly to achieve rapid drying. An advantage of pressure steam drying is resulting rapid drying without over-drying the surface compared to high temperature <b>drying</b> at <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure</b> [22 – 24]. Moreover, steaming contributes on removal of some extractives which allows better access of water molecules to cell walls resulting more rapid tangential and radial diffusion [5]. Steam injection drying is a kind of pressure steam drying with slightly modification. The modification was that the superheated steam is injected through a perforated plate, whose temperature is higher than that of the steam. Pressure of the chamber is controlled above atmospheric one. The advantage of this method is that the steam heats lumber to evaporate water {{and at the same time}} brings water in the lumber out.|$|R
