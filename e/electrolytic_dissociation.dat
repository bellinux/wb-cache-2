5000|$|Raoult's name is {{best known}} in {{connection}} with work on solutions, to which he devoted {{the last two decades}} of his life. His first paper describing how solutes depressed the freezing points of solutions was published in 1878. [...] Further experiments with various solvents, such as benzene and acetic acid, in addition to water, led him to believe in a simple relation between the molecular weights of a solute and the freezing-point of a solution. He expressed the relationship as the loi générale de la congélation (general law of freezing), that if one molecule of a substance be dissolved in 100 molecules of any given solvent, the temperature of solidification of the latter will be lowered by 0.63 °C. Another relation on which Raoult worked was that concerning the depression of a solvent's vapor pressure, due to a solute, showing that the decrease is proportional to the solute's molecular weight. This relationships holds best in the limiting case of a dilute solution. [...] These two generalizations afforded a new method of determining the molecular weights of dissolved substances, and were utilized by Jacobus van 't Hoff and Wilhelm Ostwald, among other chemists, in support of the hypothesis of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>dissociation</b> in solutions. Raoult's freezing-point depression method became even more useful after it was improved by Ernst Otto Beckmann and became a standard technique for determining molecular weights of organic substances.|$|E
5000|$|In 1884, Hermann Emil Fischer {{proposed}} {{the structure of}} purine, a key structure in many biomolecules, which he later synthesized in 1898. He also began work on the chemistry of glucose and related sugars. In 1885, Eugene Goldstein named the cathode ray, later discovered to be composed of electrons, and the canal ray, later discovered to be positive hydrogen ions that had been stripped of their electrons in a cathode ray tube; these would later be named protons. The year 1885 also saw the publishing of J. H. van 't Hoff's L'Équilibre chimique dans les Systèmes gazeux ou dissous à I'État dilué (Chemical equilibria in gaseous systems or strongly diluted solutions), which dealt with this theory of dilute solutions. Here he demonstrated that the [...] "osmotic pressure" [...] in solutions which are sufficiently dilute is proportionate to the concentration and the absolute temperature so that this pressure can be represented by a formula which only deviates from the formula for gas pressure by a coefficient i. He also determined the value of i by various methods, for example {{by means of the}} vapor pressure and François-Marie Raoult's results on the lowering of the freezing point. Thus van 't Hoff was able to prove that thermodynamic laws are not only valid for gases, but also for dilute solutions. His pressure laws, given general validity by the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>dissociation</b> theory of Arrhenius (1884-1887) - the first foreigner who came to work with him in Amsterdam (1888) - are considered the most comprehensive and important in the realm of natural sciences. In 1893, Alfred Werner discovered the octahedral structure of cobalt complexes, thus establishing the field of coordination chemistry.|$|E

40|$|J. H. van 't Hoffs {{theory of}} diluted {{solutions}} (1886) In his Etudes de dynamique chimique (1884). J. H. van 't Hoff {{was confronted with}} the problem of the magnitude of the attraction of water by salts. He wondered whether it is possible to measure this force, i. e. the affinity, in the simple case of an aqueous solution. Hugo de Vries drew his attention to Wilhelm Pfeffer's experiments on osmotic pressure. This led to van 't Hoffs theory of osmotic pressure, which he formulated in 1884 - 1885 and which was published in 1885 - 1887. Van 't Hoff found an analogy between the osmotic pressure and the gas pressure. The general gas law PV=RT is also applicable to dilute solutions, although for electrolytes a factor i had to be introduced: PV=iRT. It was Svante Arrhenius who suggested that i is equal to the number of ions. In 1887 Arrhenius published his theory of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>dissociation.</b> Connected with van 't Hoffs theory of osmotic pressure, the definitive formulation of the theory of dilute solutions was obtained. Soon discussions were held about the theory of solutions. The British Association for the Advancement of Science organized a meeting in Leeds in 1893 where the new theories were fiercely attacked by a number of British scientists. In April 1893 the meeting of the Nederlandsch Natuur- en Geneeskundig Congres (Dutch Physical and Medical Congress) in Groningen reached favourably to the new ideas, On January 8, 1894, van 't Hoff lectured on the genesis of the theory of solutions before the Deutsche Chemische Gesellschaft in Berlin. It is remarkable that he asked himself whether the theory of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>dissociation</b> conforms to reality. Although his student Jacob Jan Alexander Wijs had determined the value of the dissociation constant of water (1893), van 't Hoff ended his lecture with the intriguing question: "Is the theory of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>dissociation</b> proved in this way? By no means. But it wholly unexpectedly has supplied much in the field of saponification. " It is not clear whether Van 't Hoff had his doubts on the degree of reality of the theory of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>dissociation</b> or whether {{he did not want to}} take the risk of a confrontation with his opponents...|$|E

40|$|The present paper compares three {{different}} kinds of semiconductor gas sensing materials: metal oxides (MOX), hydrogen-terminated diamond (HD), and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). Whereas in MOX materials oxygen is the chemically reactive surface species, HD and a-Si:H are covalently bonded semiconductors with hydrogenterminated surfaces. We demonstrate that these dissimilar semiconductor materials exhibit {{the same kind of}} low-temperature gas response. This low-temperature response-mechanism is mediated by a thin layer of adsorbed water with the semiconductor materials themselves acting as pH sensors. In this adsorbate-limited state the gas sensitivity is limited to molecular species that can easily dissolve in H 2 O and subsequently undergo <b>electrolytic</b> <b>dissociation.</b> At higher temperatures, where a closed layer of adsorbed water can no longer exist, the gas response is limited by direct molecule-semiconductor interactions. In this latter mode of operation, MOX gas sensors respond to adsorbed gases according to their different oxidising or reducing properties.

First, the minimal and optimal model of a proton exchange reaction, Et-OH•(H 2 O) n →Et-OH • •(H 2 O) n, was sought. The n = 3 model was found to give a strain-free hydrogen bond network with the smallest activation energy for the concerted proton transfer. In larger models, such as Et-OH•(H 2 O) 6 and Et-OH•(H 2 O) 12, the Et-OH•(H 2 O) 3 unit was confirmed to involve the concerted proton-relay movement. The transition states of proton transfers in Et-OH•(H 2 O) n (n = 6 and 12) are of the ion-pair character. Similar proton-relay reactions of Ph-OH•(H 2 O) n →Ph-OH • •(H 2 O) n were traced. A crucial difference between Et-OH•(H 2 O) n and Ph-OH•(H 2 O) n is the absence or presence of an ion-pair intermediate.

The modern {{chemical}} science {{appeared in}} dead spot because of inveterate hypotheses of free ions formation in aqueous solutions. Resistance of water colloidal dispersion systems was {{explained by the}} formation of the electrical double layer (EDL) {{on the surface of the}} dispersed phase due to spontaneous <b>electrolytic</b> <b>dissociation</b> of the molecules of dissolved substances into the ions (cations and anions) and interaction forces of molecular attraction (van der Waals forces) and electrostatic repulsion forces. I believe that in an aqueous solution the substances dissolve to molecules and their spontaneous dissociation into ions doesn?t happen. Dissociation into ions occurs only in the case of chemical reactions. The impetus of the chemical reaction is to destroy the hydrogen bonding of water clusters and formation of highly active radicals and the compounds entering into the conjugate chemical reaction with dissolved gases and other substances. The transfer of electric charges in the aqueous solution is carried out by the mixed proton-electron conductivity, which occurs as a result of the spatial distribution of charges in the supramolecular structures. During the investigation of colloid-dispersed systems it is necessary to take into account the flow of chemical interaction between the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium (water), especially the passage of conjugate chemical reactions between the products of dissociation of water clusters with dissolved substances. As far as spontaneous dissociation of the compounds (including strong electrolytes) into ions in the aqueous solution doesn?t occur, therefore no EDL is formed on the surface of the colloid-dispersed particles. As a result of interaction between the solid particle and clusters of water there is a formation of uncompensated positively charged oxonium ions and negative hydrated hydroxide ions (hydrated electrons) on the surface of solid particles, and electrostatic charges. The latter are formed as a result of Brownian motion of solid particles. In the process of coagulant water purification aluminum sulphate stays in the form of dimers [Al 2 (H 2 O) 24](SO 4) 3, has a charge of 6 + and hydrolyzes to form aluminum dihydroxylsulphate. The latter subsequently undergoes hydrolytic polymerization with formation of tetramers and ring structures of six-core complexes similar to mineral hydrargillite. The link between these structures is carried out by diol groups leading eventually to X-ray amorphous structures of hydrargillite aluminum. In constructing the micellar structures ? micelles (the first building blocks of colloid-dispersed phase) one should take into account the crystal structure of the substance resulting from the condensation process. The process of coagulation in aqueous colloid-disperse systems is physicochemical. ??????????? ?????????? ????? ????????? ? ?????? ????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????????? ????????? ????? ? ?????? ?????????. ????????? ?????? ?????????-?????????? ?????? ????????? ???????????? ???????? ?????????????? ????
