5|$|Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of New York and seeing several stone gargoyles on the corner, staring at him. Gordon developed the concept with series creator Chris Carter, who suggested the addition of more psychological aspects to the episode. Originally, the teaser was planned to be filmed at a Catholic hospital, but the shot was relocated {{to the site of}} a historic post office after concerns were raised about attaching a fake gargoyle to the building.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} shots of a dank {{underground}} sewer. Stevens {{and a group}} of women walk through the sewer and put on sunglasses before climbing out of manholes and shafts. A large crowd of women, with Stevens leading them, parades <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> as men observe the spectacle. The women begin spraying each other with bottles of water, before Stevens returns to the sewer. Throughout the video, sequences of Stevens {{and a group of}} backup dancers performing in the sewer are shown.|$|E

5|$|Ball {{then took}} leave in England. His feats in France had {{received}} considerable publicity. He {{was the first}} British ace to become a household name, and found that his celebrity was such {{that he could not}} walk <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Nottingham without being stopped and congratulated. Prior to this the British government had suppressed the names of its aces—in contrast to the policy of the French and Germans—but the losses of the Battle of the Somme, which had commenced in July, made politic the publicising of its successes in the air. Ball's achievements {{had a profound impact on}} budding flyer Mick Mannock, who would become the United Kingdom's top-scoring ace and also receive the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|In the African American {{section of}} the city, where most {{dwellings}} were built of discarded material, many homes were damaged. On one street, only two houses did not lose either their walls or roof. Walls and cars were cartwheeling <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> During the storm, about 100people ran to a trash incinerator, a concrete-reinforced building. A few of the local Black churches suffered significant damage. Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church lost many bricks on its front facade {{and much of the}} metal grillwork around the entrances, while the building itself was deroofed. Payne Chapel AME Church, then located at Banyan Boulevard and Tamarind Avenue, was destroyed by the storm. St. Patrick's Catholic Church received about $40,000 in damage.|$|E
5|$|Shadrick's {{family was}} {{informed}} {{of his death}} by a neighbor who had heard his name on a radio broadcast, and the news from the military came via telegraph several days later. The family was immediately inundated by reporters and local well-wishers. Shadrick's body was returned to the United States, and on June 17, 1951, a funeral attended by hundreds of local residents was held in Beckley, West Virginia. The service was set {{to coincide with the}} anniversary of the start of the war. His flag-draped casket was escorted <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of the town on a horse-drawn carriage, and he was buried at the American Legion cemetery in the town.|$|E

5|$|Writer Howard Gordon {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the episode while he was walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of New York and noticed several stone gargoyles on the corner staring at him. Gordon developed the idea into an X-File involving possession by a gargoyle spirit. He wrote a draft script for the episode but had to turn to series creator Chris Carter three days before production began in order to rework it. The two worked on the script over the weekend to add more psychological aspects to the episode. Gordon claimed to be very proud of the final product. Assistant Art Director Gary Allen drew the gargoyle sketches used in this episode.|$|E
25|$|Next, {{approximately}} half-an-hour before kick-off, {{the band}} steps off from {{in front of}} the Main Building for their traditional march to the stadium, led by the Cheerleaders and Irish Guard, the band parades <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> lined by fans clapping and cheering the Irish onwards to victory.|$|E

25|$|Today, {{carnival}} minstrels {{are mostly}} Coloured ("mixed race"), Afrikaans-speaking revelers. Often in a pared-down style of blackface which exaggerates only the lips. They parade <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> {{of the city}} in colorful costumes, in a celebration of Creole culture. Participants also pay homage to the carnival's African-American roots, playing Negro spirituals and jazz featuring traditional Dixieland jazz instruments, including horns, banjos, and tambourines.|$|E
25|$|Army {{tanks and}} APCs were brought outside as the army took position, {{but they could}} not move as {{officers}} were kept as hostages. BDR headquarters had heavy weapons inside that were controlled by the rebels. The army was preparing for a final assault as tanks were rolling <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Dhaka. Paratroops and commandos were ready, but the PM tried to solve the case without any casualties.|$|E
25|$|Pail closets, outhouses, and cesspits {{were used}} to collect human waste. The use of human waste as {{fertilizer}} was especially important in China and Japan, where cattle manure was less available. However, most cities {{did not have a}} functioning sewer system before the Industrial era, relying instead on nearby rivers or occasional rain showers to wash away the sewage from the streets. In some places, waste water simply ran <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> which had stepping stones to keep pedestrians out of the muck, and eventually drained as runoff into the local watershed.|$|E

25|$|All Muni lines {{except for}} cable cars are {{wheelchair}} accessible. All bus lines have bicycle racks, but streetcars and cable cars do not. Because of San Francisco's geographical makeup (the city having neighborhoods located on hilltop-like areas, {{making it difficult}} for vehicles to drive up or <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets),</b> Muni operators are banned from using low-floor buses on certain routes with streets requiring buses or trolleybuses that are capable of reaching steep grades. But, as of 2013, high-floor vehicles are no longer available to be purchased by Muni; come 2019, all low-floor ones will be in service.|$|E
25|$|Just as the Soviets {{had learned}} a lot about urban warfare, so had the Germans. The Waffen-SS did not use {{makeshift}} barricades erected close to street corners, because these could be raked by artillery fire from guns firing over open sights further along the straight streets. Instead, they put snipers and machine guns on the upper floors and roofs because the Soviet tanks could not elevate their guns that high, and simultaneously they put men armed with panzerfausts in cellar windows to ambush tanks as they moved <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> These tactics were quickly adopted by the Hitler Youth and the First World War Volkssturm veterans.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 19th century cabildos were {{practically}} extinct after failed rebellions by the African slaves. There was a revival in their {{number in the}} mid-19th century, when {{they were no longer}} limited to slaves but welcomed free Afro-Cubans of all walks of life. In 1884, the Cuban government outlawed the Epiphany, a celebration cabildos practiced {{for more than a century}} on the 6th of January, which included parading as comparsas <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Havana. In 1887, new laws required cabildos to obtain prior official recognition and licenses. Since slavery had by then been abolished, the authorities sought new means of controlling the free Afro-Cuban population. In 1888 the government forced cabildos to organize as mutual-aid societies following the established laws for white Cuban societies.|$|E

25|$|Shrove Tuesday {{is a day}} to {{be remembered}} by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun, frolic, and comic masquerading. All of the {{mischief}} {{of the city is}} alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and boys, women and girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and appear in grotesque, quizzical, diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and birds, beasts and birds with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the moon; mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts, coaches, cars, , in rich confusion, up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming, fiddling, fifeing, and all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.|$|E
25|$|The first résistant {{executed}} by the Germans was a Polish Jewish immigrant named Israël Carp, shot in Bordeaux on 28 August 1940 for jeering a German military parade <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Bordeaux. The first Frenchman shot for resistance was the 19 year-old Pierre Roche, who was shot on 7 September 1940 after he was caught cutting the phone lines between Royan and La Rochelle. On 10 September 1940, the military governor of France, General Otto von Stülpnagel announced in a press statement that no mercy would be granted to those engaging in sabotage and all saboteurs would be shot. Despite his warning, more continued to engage in sabotage. Louis Lallier, a farmer was shot for sabotage on 11 September in Epinal and Marcel Rossier, a mechanic was shot in Rennes on 12 September. One more was shot in October 1940, and three more in November 1940.|$|E
25|$|Initially Soviet tanks {{advanced}} {{down the}} middle of the streets, but to counter the German tactics, they altered their own and started to hug the sides of the streets (this allowed for supporting cross-fire from tanks either side of the wider thoroughfares). The Soviets also mounted sub-machine gunners on the tanks who sprayed every doorway and window, but this meant the tank could not traverse its turret quickly. Another solution was to rely on heavy howitzers (152mm and 203mm) firing over open sights to blast defended buildings and to use anti-aircraft guns against the German gunners on the higher floors. Soviet combat groups started to move from house to house instead of directly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> They moved through the apartments and cellars, blasting holes through the walls of adjacent buildings (making effective use of abandoned German panzerfausts), while others fought across the rooftops and through the attics. These enfilading tactics took the Germans lying in ambush for tanks in the flanks. Flamethrowers and grenades proved to be very effective, but as the Berlin civilian population had not been evacuated, these tactics inevitably killed many.|$|E
