5|$|A {{widely used}} zinc alloy is brass, in which copper is alloyed with {{anywhere}} from 3% to 45% zinc, {{depending upon the}} type of brass. Brass is <b>generally</b> <b>more</b> ductile and stronger than copper, and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{commonly}} include ecchymosis and swelling. The pain is <b>generally</b> <b>more</b> {{severe than}} bites from the copperhead, but less so {{than those from}} rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.). The formation of vesicles and bullae is less common than with rattlesnake bites, although necrosis can occur. Myokymia is sometimes reported. However, the venom has strong proteolytic activity {{that can lead to}} severe tissue destruction.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{the actual}} piano sheet music {{from each of}} the ten Final Fantasy Piano Collections albums has been {{published}} as ten corresponding music books by Yamaha Music Media. Each book contains the original music, exactly as arranged and performed on the albums. Unlike the Original Score arrangements, these pieces are intended only for advanced players as they are <b>generally</b> <b>more</b> difficult. Sheet music for the Final Fantasy XI Piano Collections album included in the Final Fantasy XI OST Premium Box Set was included in that box set, and, like the album itself, is unavailable for purchase elsewhere; sheet music for the identically named standalone piano album is published by Yamaha.|$|E

5|$|Aided by his serve, Raonic employs an all-court {{style with}} an {{emphasis}} on short points. His groundstrokes are both good, but his forehand is stronger than his backhand. Because of this, he has been known to run around his backhand and hit inside-out forehands instead. He attempts to dictate play and is <b>generally</b> <b>more</b> aggressive than his opponent, as evidenced by usually having more winners and more unforced errors. To finish points quickly, Raonic occasionally approaches the net, with either a serve and volley or chip and charge strategy.|$|E
5|$|Although the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition was {{traditionally}} {{the most prestigious}} venue for English artists to display their new material, Watts chose to exhibit Hope at the smaller Grosvenor Gallery. In 1882 the Grosvenor Gallery had staged a retrospective exhibition of Watts's work and he felt an attachment to the venue. Also, at this time the Grosvenor Gallery was <b>generally</b> <b>more</b> receptive than the Royal Academy to experimentation. Hope was given the prime spot in the exhibition, in {{the centre of the}} gallery's longest wall.|$|E
5|$|Encaenia: Fordham College at Rose Hill hosts an Encaenia {{each year}} in early May. Faculty, administrators, and {{students}} process in academic regalia, and candidates for degrees at the current year's Commencement receive various awards and honors.

5|$|Flukes (Trematoda) {{from the}} {{subclass}} Digenea are common parasites of small mammals with complex life cycles. In his 1988 study, Kinsella found an unprecedentend 21species of trematodes in Florida marsh rice rats. The intermediate hosts of these trematodes include {{a variety of}} invertebrates, fish, and amphibians, which are eaten by the marsh rice rat. Trematodes were <b>generally</b> <b>more</b> common at the Cedar Key saltwater marsh than at the freshwater marsh in Paynes Prairie.|$|E
5|$|He was <b>generally</b> <b>more</b> highly {{regarded}} for his batting than his wicket-keeping, often drawing criticism {{for the quality}} of his glovework. Despite this, he was at times considered to be a better wicket-keeper than two of his rivals for England; Bairstow and Buttler. Nonetheless, playing in an era when international teams did not play specialist wicket-keepers, Kieswetter's selection was based primarily upon his batting ability, rather than his keeping ability. For a couple of matches during 2012, he was used as an off spin bowler by Somerset, collecting three wickets.|$|E
5|$|Impala feed on {{soft and}} nutritious grasses such as Digitaria macroblephara; tough, tall grasses, such as Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, are {{typically}} avoided. Impala {{on the periphery}} of the herds are <b>generally</b> <b>more</b> vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual will try to defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that time spent in foraging reaches a maximum of 75.5% of the day in the late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early dry season (57.8%).|$|E

5|$|Male tigers are <b>generally</b> <b>more</b> {{intolerant}} of other males within their territories than females are of other females. Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression. Several such incidents {{have been observed}} in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto its back and showing its belly in a submissive posture. Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, {{as long as they}} do not live in too close quarters. The most aggressive disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and may rarely result in the death of one of the males.|$|E
5|$|Player created digital walkthroughs are {{typically}} designed to assist other players in accomplishing certain feats within {{video games and}} are similar to text-based or telephony-based walkthroughs, except {{they can also be}} solely for entertainment purposes. These digital walkthroughs {{are typically}} uploaded to video sharing websites such as YouTube or live-streamed playthroughs to media streaming sites such as Twitch.tv. Let's Play videos are a special type of walkthrough <b>generally</b> <b>more</b> focused on entertaining rather than informing the viewer through humorous commentary given by the video's host as they complete the game.|$|E
5|$|Skopje's citizenry is <b>generally</b> <b>more</b> educated {{than the}} rest of the country. For one, 16% of Skopjans {{graduated}} university in contrast to 10% for the rest of the country. The number of people with a complete lack of education or ones who received a partial education is lower in Skopje at 9% compared to the provincial average of 17%. 80% of Macedonian citizens who hold a PhD take up residence in Skopje.|$|E

The CS spray used by UK police is <b>generally</b> <b>more</b> concentrated than that used by American police forces (5% vs 1%). The liquid stream is directed where the user points the canister, being accurate up to 4 metres. They are also trained in helping the incapacitated person recover once successfully restrained.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese Indonesian {{population}} of Sumatra accounts {{for nearly half}} of the group's national population. Although they are <b>generally</b> <b>more</b> urbanized than Indonesia's indigenous population, significant rural and agricultural communities exist throughout the country. Declining fertility rates have resulted in an upward shift in the population pyramid, as the median age increases. Emigration has contributed to a shrinking population, and communities have emerged in more industrialized nations {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. Some have participated in repatriation programs to the People's Republic of China, while others emigrated to Western countries to escape anti-Chinese sentiment. Among the overseas residents, their identities are noticeably more Indonesian than Chinese.|$|E
5|$|The Devonian and Silurian {{rocks are}} <b>generally</b> <b>more</b> {{resistant}} to weathering than the limestone, and form {{some of the}} highest points on the hills, including the highest at Beacon Batch on Black Down, 325metres (1068ft) above sea level. Black Down is a moorland area, with its steeper slopes covered in bracken (Pteridium) and its flatter summit in heather (Calluna) and grasses rather than the pasture which covers much of the plateau. The main body of the range is an extended plateau, 6–8km (4–5miles) wide and generally about 240metres (800ft) above sea level.|$|E

The majority of the world's top universities listed by different ranking organizations are in the U.S. There are also local community colleges with <b>generally</b> <b>more</b> open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition. Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees. The basic literacy rate is approximately 99%. The United Nations assigns the United States an Education Index of 0.97, tying it for 12th in the world.|$|E
5|$|The column or trunk is <b>generally</b> <b>more</b> or less {{cylindrical}} {{and may be}} {{plain and}} smooth or may bear specialist structures; these include solid papillae (fleshy protuberances), adhesive papillae, cinclides (slits) and small protruding vesicles. In some species the part immediately below the oral disc is constricted and {{is known as the}} capitulum. When the animal contracts, the oral disc, tentacles and capitulum fold inside the pharynx and are held in place by a strong sphincter muscle part way up the column. There may be a fold in the body wall, known as a parapet, at this point, and this parapet covers and protects the anemone when it is retracted.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{asserts that}} all wild trees grow from seed or from roots. He {{mentions}} that the philosophers spoke of spontaneous generation, as when Anaxagoras claims the air contains {{the seeds of}} every plant, whereas Diogenes believed plants arose when water mixed with earth. In places like Crete, Theophrastus writes that native plants spring up if the ground is simply disturbed, and that wild trees are <b>generally</b> <b>more</b> vigorous than cultivated ones, give fruit later, and like cold and hilly terrain. He asserts that trees which can grow both on hill and plain grow better and taller when grown on the plain.|$|E
