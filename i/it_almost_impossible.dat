5|$|The 12th SS Panzer Division (by {{the end of}} {{the battle}} the division's {{infantry}} strength had been reduced to that of a battalion)—claimed over the course of two days to have destroyed 103 British and Canadian tanks for the loss of 20. On entering Caen the Anglo-Canadian troops found it in ruins, with four-fifths of the Old City reduced to rubble by the 7 July bombings. The debris that choked the streets made <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> for British armour to manoeuvre through the northern half of the city, preventing Second Army from exploiting I Corps's success. Without possession of the terrain flanking the south of the city, no further gains could be made within Caen so by mid-afternoon on 9 July, Operation Charnwood was over.|$|E

25|$|In {{his last}} years Ford was dogged by declining health, largely {{the result of}} decades of heavy {{drinking}} and smoking, and exacerbated by the wounds he suffered during the Battle of Midway. His vision in particular began to deteriorate rapidly {{and at one point}} he briefly lost his sight entirely; his prodigious memory also began to falter, making it necessary to rely more and more on assistants. His work was also restricted by the new regime in Hollywood, and he found it hard to get many projects made. By the 1960s he had been pigeonholed as a Western director and complained that he now found <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to get backing for projects in other genres.|$|E
25|$|The Amphitrite class {{suffered}} {{from all the}} usual monitor defects (as did Puritan which was eventually redesignated as a unique class due to her extra armor), and their combat limitations quickly became evident during the Spanish–American War. For example, during one sortie to Puerto Rico, USS Amphitrite {{had to be taken}} under tow as she lacked the fuel reserves to travel there under her own steam, reducing the speed of the entire fleet to a mere seven knots. Having arrived at the destination, Amphitrites heavy guns proved effective against shore defences, but the heat within the ship was so oppressive during the 2 hour bombardment that the crew found <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to continue manning their posts, and one of the gunners actually died of heat exhaustion.|$|E

Sykes had stated that the accomplished fact of the independence of the Hejaz rendered <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> that an effective and real autonomy should be refused to Syria. However, the minutes also record that the Syrian Arabs in Egypt were not happy with developments and absent a clearer, less ambiguous statement in regard to the future of Syria and Mesopotamia then the Allies as well as the King of the Hedjaz would lose much Arab support.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1950s, Muslim {{immigrants}} have emigrated to western countries {{in large numbers}} because fellow Muslim countries that are well-off economically and socially do not accept them. Out of the 57 Muslim majority countries, only two nations (Turkey and Malaysia) offer a formal path for immigrants to become naturalized citizens, regardless of birthplace, religious beliefs, marital status or ethnic origin. Even the oil-rich Gulf states do not grant citizenship to immigrants, regardless of how long they have resided in those countries. To make matters more difficult, Gulf states have stringent laws which explicitly state that an immigrant or expat can become a citizen only if his/her father was a citizen or, in some cases, if an expat woman marries an Arab national. These laws make <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> for expats (both Muslim and non-Muslim) to gain citizenship.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time Bedouin herding was {{restricted}} by land expropriation. The Black Goat Law of 1950 curbed grazing so as to prevent land erosion, prohibiting the grazing of goats outside recognized land holdings. Because few Bedouin territorial claims were recognized, most grazing was rendered illegal. Since both Ottoman and British land registration processes had failed to reach into the Negev region before Israeli rule, and since most Bedouin preferred not to register their lands, few Bedouin possessed any documentation of their land claims. Those whose land claims were recognized found <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to keep their goats within the periphery of their newly limited range. Into the 1970s and 1980s, {{only a small portion}} of the Bedouin were able to continue to graze their goats, and instead of migrating with their goats in search of pasture, most Bedouin migrated in search of work.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1999, alleged {{insurgents and}} Pakistani {{soldiers}} from Pakistani Kashmir infiltrated Jammu and Kashmir. During the winter season, Indian forces regularly move down to lower altitudes, as severe climatic conditions makes <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> {{for them to}} guard the high peaks near the Line of Control. This practice is followed by both India and Pakistan Army. The terrain {{makes it difficult for}} both sides to maintain a strict border control over Line of Control. The insurgents took advantage of this and occupied vacant mountain peaks in the Kargil range overlooking the highway in Indian Kashmir that connects Srinagar and Leh. By blocking the highway, they could cut off the only link between the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh. This resulted in a large-scale conflict between the Indian and Pakistani armies. The final stage involved major battles by Indian and Pakistani forces resulting in India recapturing most of the territories held by Pakistani forces.|$|E

25|$|Unrest among wheat farmers, {{especially}} among Norwegian immigrants, {{led to a}} populist political movement centered in the Non Partisan League ("NPL") {{around the time of}} World War I, during which it ran candidates on the Republican ticket (yet merging into the Democratic Party after World War II). It tried to insulate North Dakota from the power of out-of-state banks and corporations. In addition to founding the state-owned Bank of North Dakota and North Dakota Mill and Elevator (both still in existence), the NPL established a state-owned railroad line (later sold to the Soo Line Railroad). Anti-corporate laws virtually prohibited a corporation or bank from owning title to land zoned as farmland. These laws, still in force today, after having been upheld by state and federal courts, make <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to foreclose on farmland, as even after foreclosure, the property title cannot be held by a bank or mortgage company. Furthermore, the Bank of North Dakota, having powers similar to a Federal Reserve branch bank, exercised its power to limit the issuance of subprime mortgages and their collateralization in the form of derivative instruments, and so prevented a collapse of housing prices within the state in the wake of 2008's financial crisis.|$|E
25|$|President Juárez {{once again}} based his {{government}} {{in the state of}} Chihuahua and it served as the center for the resistance against the French invasion throughout Mexico. On March 25, 1866, a battle ensued in the Plaza de Armas in the center of Chihuahua City between the French imperial forces that were guarding the plaza and the Republican forces led by General Terrazas. Being completely caught off guard, the French imperial forces sought refuge by bunkering themselves in the Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Our Lady of Regla, and St Fancis of Assisi and made <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to penetrate their defenses. General Terrazas then decided to fire a heavy artillery barrage with 8kg cannonballs. The first cannon fired hit a bell in the tower of the church, instantly breaking it in half; soon after, 200 men of the imperial army forces surrendered. The republican forces had recovered control over the state capital. The bell in the church was declared a historical monument and can be seen today in the Cathedral. By April 1866, the state government had established a vital trading route from Chihuahua City to San Antonio, Texas; the government began to replenish their supplies and reinforce their fight against the Imperial forces.|$|E
25|$|After two wins {{from the}} opening seven matches, Curtis signed Leicester City forward Peter McKennan for £8,000, though he failed to have an {{immediate}} effect on the team's goalscoring problems. Brentford were able to stay afloat in mid-table due to the low number of goals conceded. The Essential Work Order made <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> for the Bees to sign any player aged under 30, due to the club having spent £28,300 (almost double the club's net income) on six new players during the previous financial year, with only Jack Chisholm and Fred Monk aged under 30. Amidst a dire run of form in league matches {{around the turn of}} the year, Peter McKennan finally came into form and scored 9 goals in a seven-match spell, firing Brentford into the sixth round of the FA Cup for the second time in four seasons. In the midst of the run was Brentford's biggest win of the season (8–2 versus Bury on 19 February 1949), in which McKennan became the third (and as of the end of the 2015–16 season) most recent Bees player to score five goals in a Football League match. The Bury fixture also marked the first match in charge for player/manager Jackie Gibbons, having replaced Harry Curtis, who would remain with the club until the end of the season as an advisor to Gibbons. Brentford's FA Cup run ended with defeat to Leicester City in the sixth round, with the 38,678 crowd setting a new Griffin Park record which still stands as of May 2016.|$|E
