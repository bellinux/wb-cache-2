5|$|At {{the same}} time as the dive bombers were attacking, the 20 torpedo bombers were also {{approaching}} <b>Hornet</b> from two different directions. Despite suffering heavy losses from anti-aircraft fire, the torpedo planes planted two torpedoes into Hornets side between 09:13 and 09:17, knocking out her engines. As <b>Hornet</b> came to a stop, a damaged Japanese dive bomber approached and purposely crashed into the carrier's side, starting a fire near the ship's main supply of aviation fuel. At 09:20, the surviving Japanese aircraft departed, leaving <b>Hornet</b> dead in the water and burning. Twenty-five Japanese and six American aircraft were destroyed in this attack.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Australian {{government}} decided to retire the F-111s by 2010, and acquire 24 Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornets as an interim replacement, pending {{the arrival of}} the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning then being developed. The F-111 fleet was considered to be at risk due to fatigue, and too expensive to operate as each aircraft required 180 hours of maintenance for every hour of flying time. No.1 Squadron ceased operating the F-111 in January 2009, in preparation for converting to the Super <b>Hornet.</b> Former F-111 aircrew, familiar with side-by-side seating and a different performance envelope, found conversion more challenging than pilots experienced in the RAAF's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 <b>Hornet</b> fighters, which shared many characteristics with the newer model. No.1 Squadron re-equipped between 26March 2010 and 21October 2011, making it the first Australian unit, and the first squadron outside the United States, to fly the Super <b>Hornet.</b> It became operational with its new aircraft on 8December 2011. The multi-role Super <b>Hornet</b> allowed No.1 Squadron to augment its previous offensive strike role with an air-to-air combat function. The RAAF attained full operational capability with the Super <b>Hornet</b> in December 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for {{the introduction of the}} F/A-18 <b>Hornet,</b> No.2 OCU temporarily ceased flying operations on 1January 1985 and transferred Macchi and Mirage training to No.77 Squadron, which assumed responsibility for fighter combat instructor, introductory fighter, and Mirage conversion courses. Beginning on 17May, the first fourteen Australian Hornets—seven single-seat F/A-18As and seven two-seat F/A-18Bs—and a <b>Hornet</b> simulator were delivered to No.2 OCU. Conversion courses on the type commenced on 19August with four F/A-18Bs and three students. No.2 OCU has remained the prime user of the two-seat <b>Hornet,</b> though some are operated by the fighter squadrons, Nos.3, 75 and 77. The first year of <b>Hornet</b> service saw No.2 OCU, as the then-only RAAF operator, undertake demonstration flights around the country to unveil the new fighter to the Australian public. All of the <b>Hornet</b> units came under the control of a newly re-formed No.81 Wing on 2February 1987. An intense training program that year resulted in 21 pilots converting to the type. In June 1987, Macchi training courses again became the responsibility of No.2 OCU; this role was taken over by No.76 Squadron in January 1989. No.2 OCU suffered its only <b>Hornet</b> loss to date when an F/A-18B crashed at Great Palm Island, Queensland, during a night-time training flight on 18November 1987, killing the pilot. Two Hornets collided during an air-to-air combat training exercise the previous year, but both managed to return to base. The unit temporarily relocated to RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, in July 1990, while Williamtown's runway was resurfaced.|$|E
50|$|During {{the launch}} 202 <b>hornets</b> {{died as a}} result of a {{malfunction}} in the water system that caused an abnormal increase in humidity. The surviving <b>hornets</b> lost their sense of direction and, unlike the control unit <b>hornets,</b> were unable to climb on the walls or stay in clusters. Instead, they stayed motionless and apart from each other. Roughly 3 to 4 days upon returning to earth, the <b>hornets</b> started climbing on the walls again and building a nest. The surviving <b>hornets</b> lived for an average of 23 days, compared to an average survival of 43 days for the control group <b>hornets.</b>|$|R

Under the Defence Materiel Organisation's Project AIR 6000 Phase 2A/B, the first Lightnings will be delivered to the RAAF in late 2018. Each of No.81 Wing's three fighter squadrons will operate sixteen of the new aircraft. No.77 Squadron {{is scheduled to begin}} conversion in 2021; RAAF <b>Hornet</b> operations are expected to cease the following year.|$|E
5|$|The fleet that Hopkins {{launched}} {{consisted of}} Alfred, <b>Hornet,</b> Wasp, Fly, Andrew Doria, Cabot, Providence, and Columbus. In addition to ships' crews, it carried 200 marines {{under the command}} of Samuel Nicholas. In spite of gale force winds, the fleet remained together for two days, when Fly and <b>Hornet</b> became separated from the fleet. <b>Hornet</b> was forced to return to port for repairs, and Fly eventually caught up with the fleet at Nassau, after the raid took place. Hopkins did not let the apparent loss of the two ships dissuade him; he had intelligence that much of the British fleet was in port due to the high winds.|$|E
50|$|On July 25, 2014, Pargo re-signed {{with the}} Charlotte <b>Hornets</b> to a {{reported}} fully guaranteed one-year, $1.45 million contract.

On February 4, 2015, he was waived by the <b>Hornets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Charlotte <b>Hornets</b> are {{regarded}} as {{a continuation of the}} original Charlotte franchise. Because of this, the New Orleans Pelicans are no longer the same franchise as the original Charlotte <b>Hornets.</b> The <b>Hornets</b> were known as the Bobcats from 2004-2014. The New Orleans Pelicans were established in 2002. The Charlotte <b>Hornets</b> rejoined the league in 2004.|$|R
25|$|The playoffs also {{marked the}} last {{appearance}} of the Charlotte <b>Hornets</b> in the playoffs until 2010. The <b>Hornets</b> moved the next year to New Orleans, while an expansion team, formerly the Bobcats, was formed in 2004. The <b>Hornets</b> were renamed the Pelicans in 2013, after which the Bobcats reclaimed the <b>Hornets</b> name in 2014. The <b>Hornets</b> also reclaimed the history and records of the 1988–2002 Charlotte teams. The Charlotte Coliseum played host to its final playoff game on May 12.|$|R
5|$|At 11:35, Kinkaid {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} Enterprise and her screening ships from battle, since <b>Hornet</b> {{was out of}} action, Enterprise was heavily damaged, and surmising, correctly, that the Japanese had one or two undamaged carriers in the area. Leaving <b>Hornet</b> behind, Kinkaid directed the carrier and her task force to retreat {{as soon as they}} were able. Between 11:39 and 13:22, Enterprise recovered 57 of the 73 airborne U.S. aircraft as she retreated. The remaining U.S. aircraft ditched in the ocean, and their aircrews were rescued by escorting warships.|$|E
5|$|Australia is {{currently}} {{a partner in the}} development of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter, with plans for the country to procure up to 100 examples to replace the F-111 as well as the F/A-18 <b>Hornet.</b>|$|E
5|$|Four RAAF units {{converted}} to the <b>Hornet</b> between 1985 and 1988. The first 14 Hornets were allocated to No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit (2OCU) at RAAF Base Williamtown, and {{were used to}} train the pilots and instructors needed to convert the RAAF's three fighter squadrons to the aircraft. 2OCU's first <b>Hornet</b> operational conversion course began on 19 August 1985. In addition to the unit's training activities, 2OCU aircraft travelled widely around Australia and South East Asia during 1985 and 1986 to showcase the new aircraft. No.3 Squadron was the first fighter unit to convert from the MirageIII, and became operational with the <b>Hornet</b> in August 1986. It was followed by No.77 Squadron in June 1987 and No.75 Squadron in May 1988. No.81 Wing, whose headquarters is located at Williamtown, has commanded these four units since they {{converted to}} the F/A-18. As of 2012, 2OCU, No.3 and No.77 Squadrons are stationed at Williamtown and No.75 Squadron is located at Tindal. In addition, two Hornets are allocated to the Aircraft Research and Development Unit at RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia.|$|E

The <b>Hornets</b> also were starting to receive votes for national rankings, as well. Higgins led the <b>Hornets</b> to another 8-0 start, scoring 35+ points a game. The No. 10 Hornets' winning streak was again snapped to the Northwest Missouri State Bearcats. The <b>Hornets</b> won their next game after against Washburn. Finishing regular season play, Higgins led the <b>Hornets</b> to a 9-1 overall, 9-1 in conference play, advancing to the NCAA Playoffs {{for the first time}} since 2003. The <b>Hornets</b> lost to the Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs 55-13.|$|R
5000|$|In the draft, the <b>Hornets</b> drafted J. R. Smith and Tim Pickett. Smith {{would play}} only two {{seasons with the}} <b>Hornets,</b> and Pickett would not play in the NBA.

5|$|<b>Hornet</b> {{conversion}} courses run for six months, {{after which}} graduates are posted {{to one of}} the RAAF's front-line fighter units, No.3 Squadron or No.77 Squadron at Williamtown, or No.75 Squadron at RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory. Students must first gain their instrument rating on the <b>Hornet,</b> and are then taught basic fighter manoeuvres, air combat techniques, air-to-air gunnery, and air-to-ground tactics. The course culminates with Exercise High Sierra, a biannual event that was first run at Townsville, Queensland, in 1986. The exercise lasts for two weeks and involves day and night flights, including precision strike sorties with practice and live bombs.|$|E
5|$|No.410 Squadron RCAF is {{currently}} equipped (2011) with the CF-18 <b>Hornet.</b> The first two CF-18s were formally {{handed over to}} 410 (Operational Training Unit) Squadron at CFB Cold Lake, Alberta on 25 October 1982.|$|E
5|$|The wing {{converted}} from Sabres to Mirages between 1964 and 1966, commencing with No.2 OCU and concluding with No.76 Squadron; the last-mentioned disbanded in 1973. No.81 Wing itself disbanded at Williamtown in December 1966. No.75 Squadron was based at RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia, from 1967 until 1983, when it relocated to Darwin. Following conversion to the F/A-18 <b>Hornet</b> in 1988, it transferred to Tindal.
