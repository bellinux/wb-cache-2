500|$|Air story {{revolves}} around three girls {{whose lives are}} connected to the same man. In the first story arc, Dream, Yukito Kunisaki is a showman traveling across Japan, continuing his late mother's search for the [...] "girl in the sky".Translated quote: [...] "...at {{the far end of the}} sky, there is a girl who has wings...from the distant past...even now, she is still there. That is what I heard from my mother when I was small. Before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> more clearly, my mother died. After that, I continued journeying alone. The myth of the girl in the sky." [...] The story opens on Monday July 17, 2000 when Yukito comes across a small seaside town where the story takes place. On his first day in town, Yukito tries to earn money by putting on a mysterious puppet show where he manipulates a doll magically without strings for a small audience of kids passing by. Yukito is unsuccessful in gaining the children's favor, and the children leave without paying him for his performance. That night, Yukito sleeps on the town's seawall by the beach. Yukito collapses from heat stroke the next day and is taken to a nearby fisherman's guild; after he awakens, they feed him, and give him some very large rice balls to take with him as he is leaving. As he sits on the town's seawall eating one of the rice balls, he notices a young girl beside him who introduces herself as Misuzu Kamio—a sincere yet clumsy girl who is eager to become friends with him. Misuzu persistently attempts to play with him, while Yukito tries to refuse her efforts. He eventually follows her home lured by the chance to eat. After Haruko, Misuzu's aunt and foster mother, is persuaded, it is decided that he will stay with them for the time being.Translated quote: [...] "...I understand. Stay here. Sleep in the garage." ...|$|E

2500|$|The song a midtempo ballad {{in which}} Alexander {{reflects}} on a past relationship and wonders why his girlfriend left him, eventually concluding that someday he'll know the answer. Rolling Stone called the song [...] "reflective," [...] while Consequence of Sound {{commented that the}} song is [...] "relatable to the ever-been-broken-hearted with lines like 'I’m speeding by the place that I met you for the 97th time tonight' and 'If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> God just one question: Why aren’t you here with me tonight?” ...|$|E

60|$|I {{told him}} as briefly as <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> and <b>asked</b> {{him if he}} could explain the matter. He shook his head.|$|R
60|$|After reading those words, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> safely <b>ask</b> Priscilla {{to help me}} in reopening {{the mysterious}} murder case to some good purpose.|$|R

After the event, Mickelson called the loss heartbreaking and said [...] "this is tough to swallow after coming so close ...

60|$|Before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> {{him what}} he meant, he looked up {{suddenly}} at me, with deep sadness on his usually nonchalant face.|$|E
60|$|I gave {{my brother}} into your hands, and {{told you that}} if he died a brave man's death <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> for no more.|$|E
60|$|I {{said about}} four hundred {{thousand}} dollars a month, and board, was about all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> reasonably <b>ask,</b> considering the hard times.|$|R
6000|$|A mingled {{feeling of}} fear and veneration kept me silent, till I {{perceived}} by his look that he expected and encouraged me to speak; and collecting my spirits as well as <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him wherefore he had thought proper to appear, and why to me rather than to any other person? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have done}} so much, Signor Polani. You have heaped {{kindness}} upon me, altogether beyond anything <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have hoped for, that, even did I wish for more, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>ask</b> it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> him perhaps {{about how}} to {{pronounce}} that voglio. But then if he didn't know only make it awkward for him. Better not.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, my lord; {{you gave}} me no {{instructions}} about it, and I thought it better {{to wait until the}} morning, when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> him, {{or about}} hell either, {{he was gone}} like a whiff of smoke from a rifle mouth in a strong wind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I can't {{marry you}} simply because you're sorry for me. <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> but--it's <b>asking</b> {{too much of}} you. We had better say no more about it.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am heartily {{glad to see}} you. I {{want you}} to amuse me. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>ask</b> this of you so long as that {{fascinating}} abbess was on the island." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor did I;--but I {{should have}} done so had not Captain Aylmer been before me. And now tell me whether <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> her to come here." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{would have}} been useless and cruel to have said to him what I have just said here. I put as bright a face on it as <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> and <b>asked</b> if he {{proposed}} to follow Mr. Sebright's advice.|$|R
6000|$|At length, {{after having}} delighted us for hours, he took himself {{away from the}} companion; and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> Mackay who and what he was. ‘That?’ said Mackay. ‘Why, that’s one of the stowaways.’ ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the last}} day of the week I was told that a visitor had arrived and wished to see me, and before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> his name he had entered the room. It was Mr. Marx.|$|E

6000|$|... 'That you may rely on,' said John. 'I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help you; {{but there}} were many things at Barbuda that seemed so like fancies of my own, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>ask</b> my father to pay for them, and I have not much at my {{disposal}} just now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Because I {{wanted to}} know how it was with Henry, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>ask</b> him. Poor fellow! Well, Ave, you see he will depend on you entirely for comfort, and you must promise me that shall be your great {{business}} and care.' ...|$|R
60|$|Without a cent in my pocket, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>ask</b> for food--therefore, I {{turned back}} weary, hungry and disheartened. To {{make matters worse}} a cold rain was falling and the {{eighteen}} or twenty miles {{between me and the}} Harris farm looked long.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, I don't {{suppose we}} shall ever meet again. I don't think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> you {{to visit me}} in London. I wanted to see you, and I have seen you, but that, I fear, must {{be the end of}} it.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{did that}} make for him altogether?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not help <b>asking,</b> for I had been {{diverted}} {{by the number of}} calculations in his narrative.|$|R
