The innovative <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> design is an attempt to reduce the installed cost of the <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> heat exchange portion of the system by containing the entire <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> within the excavated location beneath the basement slab. Prior to the installation and operation of the sub-slab heat exchanger, energy modeling using TRNSYS software and concurrent design efforts were performed to determine the size and orientation of the system. One key parameter in the design is the installation of the GSHP in a low-load home, which considerably reduces the needed capacity of the <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> heat exchanger. This report analyzes data from two cooling seasons and one heating season. Upon completion of the monitoring phase, measurements revealed that the initial TRNSYS simulated horizontal sub-slab <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> heat exchanger fluid temperatures and heat transfer rates differed from the measured values. To determine the cause of this discrepancy, an updated model was developed utilizing a new TRNSYS subroutine for simulating sub-slab heat exchangers.

50|$|The <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> will be {{carrying}} some current {{at the local}} supply frequency, typically 50 Hz or 60 Hz, due to electromagnetic induction from current-carrying conductors nearby. There is an AC magnetic field everywhere in developed areas; however, its magnitude and direction depend strongly on the local environment and arrangement of current-carrying wiring. This influences the current induced in the <b>ground</b> <b>loop,</b> which is also dependent on the area enclosed by the <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> and its orientation. The impedance of the loop, basically just its resistance at low frequencies, also influences the induced current that will flow. It is important to realise that for a <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> to cause problems, {{there must be a}} local magnetic field produced by power frequency or other systems. It is the combination of radiated field and receptive <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> that causes problems, and the situation can be improved by attention to either one, or both of these.

Transformer action limits the induced voltage in the loop, and the weak coupling limits the maximum current that will flow, even if the loop resistance is very low.

We developed a novel experimental method of measuring an airborne transmitter waveform by monitoring the current induced in a closed, multiturn, insulated <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> of known inductance L and resistance R. The transmitter waveform of five different time-domain systems is deconvolved from the measured ground-loop response when {{excited by the}} primary electromagnetic field of the AEM system. In general, our measurements agree well with contractor-described transmitter current waveforms, although crucial differences exist between our deconvolved waveforms and those described in the literature.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In recent decades, ground-source {{heat pump}} (GSHP) systems have {{received}} considerable attention as an energy efficient technology for {{residential and commercial}} heating and cooling. Approximately 50, 000 GSHP systems are sold {{each year in the}} United States (Do and Haberl, 2010). As {{one of the fastest growing}} applications of alternative energy, a primary appeal of GSHP systems is their efficiency and widespread geographic applicability. GSHP systems are efficient because the geothermal exchange occurs through the sustainable transfer of stored thermal energy. GSHP systems can also be implemented worldwide because the ground acts as an effective thermal source and sink. Natural ground temperatures become relatively stable with increasing depth and are closer to room temperature (e. g., 20 �C) than air temperature during the year. Noteworthy recognition of the promising potential of GSHP systems was publicized during the late 20 th century as government reports by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and Natural Resources Canada stated, respectively, that ?GSHPs are the most energy efficient, environmentally clean, and cost-effective systems available? (US EPA, 1993) and that ?There is unlikely to be a potentially larger mitigating effect on greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting global warming impact of buildings from any other current, market available single technology, than from GSHPs? (Caneta Research, 1999). In comparison to traditional heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, GSHP systems offer benefits of reduced greenhouse gas emissions, high reliability, low maintenance, and lower energy, operating, and life-cycle costs (Inalli and Esen, 2005; Tarnawski et al., 2009; Congedo et al., 2012). Despite these advantages, however, several barriers continue to hinder increased implementation of GSHP systems. Important barriers include the high initial capital costs of GSHP systems and the lack of consumer knowledge and/or confidence in GSHP system benefits (Hughes, 2008). The high initial investment and lack of consumer confidence in GSHP systems are, in part, related to the design of the GSHP?s <b>ground</b> <b>loop.</b> As shown in Table 1 - 1, the <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> is generally the most expensive component of a GSHP system. Cane and Forgas (1991) estimated that the length of <b>ground</b> <b>loops</b> used in GSHP applications were oversized by about 10 % to 30 % in the North American market. The length of <b>ground</b> <b>loops</b> may still be oversized due to prevalent use of rule of thumbs (i. e., certain length of trench per quantity of load) and conservative estimates of subsurface properties (McQuay International, 2002; ASHRAE, 2007; Remund and Carda, 2009). Conservatively designed <b>ground</b> <b>loops</b> safeguard against worst-case scenarios but result in inefficient and uneconomical GSHP systems. Shallow horizontal <b>ground</b> <b>loops</b> have potential to provide an effective compromise between efficiency and cost if the thermal performance of the <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> is improved and the material, installation, and operating costs are reduced. By improving the design of <b>ground</b> <b>loops,</b> GSHP systems can be optimized and have better performance and lower capital investments. This thesis focuses on using energy geotechnics to improve the design of shallow horizontal <b>ground</b> <b>loops.</b> Energy geotechnics is an emerging discipline in which engineers and scientists employ principles of geotechnical engineering and the physical sciences of geology, physics, and chemistry for the advancement and design of energy-related systems, including renewables. In this study, the mechanisms and properties that govern thermal and hydraulic behavior of unsaturated soil are applied to predict coupled heat and moisture flow associated with operation of a shallow horizontal <b>ground</b> <b>loop.</b> More specifically, experimentally determined thermal conductivity dryout curves (TCDCs) and soil-water characteristic curves (SWCCs) were coupled in finite-element models to simulate temporal and spatial variations of soil surrounding horizontal <b>ground</b> <b>loops.</b> Results from the simulations were used to estimate the required total length of <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> attached to a GSHP system using a heat pump with nominal 10. 55 -kW capacity and coefficient of performance (COP) of 4. Changes in the required total length of <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> as well as associated costs are compared between models that were simulated with a soil?s TCDC versus similar models that were simulated with a conservative value of soil thermal conductivity (?soil). Chapter 2 contains background information about GSHP systems, the importance of ?soil and TCDCs, and methods for experimental determination of TCDCs. Chapter 3 discusses the selected materials, the methods used to determine material properties, and setup of a two-dimensional horizontal <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> model based on finite-element analysis. Chapter 4 presents results and analysis of the model simulations. Chapter 5 summarizes conclusions drawn from model results and discusses recommended future work to improve modeling of shallow horizontal <b>ground</b> <b>loops.</b> In the appendices, a draft of an ASTM International standard for experimental determination of thermal resistivity dryout curves (TRDCs) is included (Appendix A); a discussion on testing ?soil at elevated temperatures is included (Appendix B); and an overview of finite-modeling with SVOffice is presented (Appendix C) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of electrochemical processes during {{the operation of}} an electrospray ionization (ESI) source is well established. In the positive ion mode, electrons are drawn from the ESI metal capillary to a high voltage power supply. These electrons {{are the product of}} charge-balancing oxidation reactions taking place at the liquid/metal interface of the ion source. In a recent study, (Anal. Chem. 2001, 73, 4836 – 4844), our group has shown that the introduction of a <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> can dramatically enhance the rate of these oxidation processes. Such a <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> can be introduced by connecting the sample infusion syringe (or the liquid chromatography column, in the case of LC-MS studies) to ground. The magnitude of the <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> current can be controlled by the electrolyte concentration in the analyte solution, and by the dimensions of the capillary connecting the syringe needle and the ESI source. Using ferrocene as a model system, it is demonstrated that the introduction of such a <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> can significantly enhance the signal intensity of analytes that form electrochemically ionized species during ESI. However, analytes that form protonated molecular ions, such as reserpine, also show higher signal intensities when a <b>ground</b> <b>loop</b> is introduced into the system. This latter observation is attributed to the {{occurrence of}} electrolytic solvent (acetonitrile and/or water) oxidation processes. These reactions generate protons within the ion source, and thus facilitate the formation of [M + nH]n+ ions. Overall, this work provides an example of how the careful control of electrochemical parameters can be exploited to optimize signal intensities in ESI-MS...|$|R
