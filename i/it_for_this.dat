5|$|Copper is biostatic, meaning {{bacteria}} {{and many other}} forms of life will not grow on <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> reason {{it has long been}} used to line parts of ships to protect against barnacles and mussels. It was originally used pure, but has since been superseded by Muntz metal and copper-based paint. Similarly, as discussed in copper alloys in aquaculture, copper alloys have become important netting materials in the aquaculture industry because they are antimicrobial and prevent biofouling, even in extreme conditions and have strong structural and corrosion-resistant properties in marine environments.|$|E

5|$|When Captain Scarlet was {{repeated}} by Central Television {{in the latter}} half of the decade, changes were made to the episode's opening sequence to remove dialogue in which the Mysterons allude to surveillance equipment that is being rotated to facilitate inspection of the Martian Exploration Vehicle.

25|$|It was {{formerly}} common in American English {{to use a}} diaeresis mark to indicate a hiatus: for example, coöperate, daïs, reëlect. The New Yorker and Technology Review magazines still use <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> purpose, {{even though it is}} increasingly rare in modern English. Nowadays the diaeresis is normally left out (cooperate), or a hyphen is used (co-operate) if the hiatus is between two morphemes in a compound word.

The Comes Britanniarum clearly placed nine units of comitatenses under Stilicho. In 402, however, he withdrew most of these soldiers back to Italy to use against the rebellious West Gothic army of Alaric. Around this time, the praepositus, Justinian, had a tower replaced in the Roman camp of Ravenscar and had the last known Roman inscription in Britain placed on <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> occasion.|$|E
25|$|If ice {{is added}} after pouring {{it into the}} cup, this results in the {{formation}} of an aesthetically unpleasant layer {{on the surface of the}} drink, because the ice causes the oils to solidify. If water is added first, the ethanol causes the fat to emulsify, leading to the characteristic milky color. To avoid the precipitation of the anise (instead of emulsion), drinkers prefer not to reuse an arak-filled glass. In restaurants, when a bottle of arak is ordered, the waiter will usually bring a number of glasses along with <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason.|$|E

25|$|The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess premiered on November 9, 2006, at the Savoy Theatre (London), {{directed}} by Trevor Nunn. (Although {{that was the}} title given to this production, the 1993 television adaptation of Nunn's 1986 production had also used <b>it.)</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> new production, he adapted the lengthy opera to fit the conventions of musical theatre. Working with the Gershwin and Heyward estates, Nunn used dialogue from the original novel and subsequent Broadway stage play to replace the recitatives with naturalistic scenes. He did not use operatic voices in this production, but relied on musical theatre actors as leads. Gareth Valentine provided the musical adaptation. Despite mostly positive reviews, Nunn's production closed months early due to poor box office.|$|E
25|$|The term {{polymorphism}} {{refers to}} the ability of code (especially, functions or classes) to act on values of multiple types, or {{to the ability of}} different instances of the same data structure to contain elements of different types. Type systems that allow polymorphism generally do so in order to improve the potential for code re-use: in a language with polymorphism, programmers need only implement a data structure such as a list or an associative array once, rather than once for each type of element with which they plan to use <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> reason computer scientists sometimes call the use of certain forms of polymorphism generic programming. The type-theoretic foundations of polymorphism are closely related to those of abstraction, modularity and (in some cases) subtyping.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of rural free delivery (RFD) by the Post Office in 1896, and in Canada in 1908, many rural residents had no access to the mail unless they collected it at a post office located many miles from their homes or hired a private express company to deliver <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> reason, mailboxes did not become popular in rural North America until curbside RFD mail delivery by the Post Office was an established service. Even then, farmers and rural homeowners at first resisted the purchase of dedicated mailboxes, preferring to leave empty bushel baskets, tin boxes, or wooden crates at the roadside for the postman to deposit their mail. Not until 1923 did the Post Office finally mandate that every household install a mailbox or mail slot {{in order to receive}} home delivery of mail.|$|E

25|$|Born in L'Albenc in the {{province}} of Dauphiné on 10 December 1765, Marchand became a lawyer and practiced in Grenoble. He joined the French army in 1791, leading a company of scouts in an Isère volunteer battalion. In the French Revolutionary Wars, he served in Italy during the years 1792-1799. He fought first in Savoy, where he won notice, then at the Siege of Toulon in 1793. Marchand became a staff officer to General Jean-Baptiste Cervoni. At the Battle of Loano on 23 and 24 November 1795, he and Colonel Jean Lannes led 200 grenadiers against an enemy redoubt armed with six cannons. They successfully stormed the fortification and ejected the Hungarian grenadiers who defended <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> exploit, his army commander Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer named him chef de bataillon (major).|$|E
25|$|After {{his return}} from America on 1 July 1825, Maroto was {{entrusted}} with the command of the army of Castilla la Vieja, stationed in Valladolid, site of the general headquarters. On 1 September of that year, the field marshal placed him in command of reestablishing order with force of arms, and among the royal volunteers of the Principality of Asturias. Later, on 11 July 1828, he was employed by royal order in the barracks at Pamplona. On 21 June 1829, the king granted him quarters in the Army of New Castile stationed in Madrid. On 15 March 1832 he was named commanding general of the province of Toledo. He renounced that post on 31 October, as the story goes, because he was forced by Count Ignacio de Negri to support an insurrection by his troops, and he felt that before acting against the government he ought to break all ties with <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> same reason he refused the charge, conferred upon him on 5 January 1833, of second-in-command and general commander of the Basque Provinces.|$|E
