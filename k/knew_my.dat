500|$|In 1988, Sonic Youth {{recorded}} [...] "Within You Without You" [...] for the NMEs multi-artist tribute Sgt. Pepper <b>Knew</b> <b>My</b> Father. Fricke highlights {{this recording}} {{as an example}} of how, regardless of its Indian origins, the composition can be interpreted on electric guitar effectively and [...] "with transportive force". In 2007, the staff of the New York pop culture website Vulture placed Sonic Youth's version at number 2 in their list titled [...] "Our Ten Favorite Beatles Covers of All Time".|$|E
500|$|The 1990s are remembered, {{by many in}} the West, as a time of {{relative}} prosperity and satisfaction. [...] According to some historians, visionary politics appeared to be on the decline. [...] However, even after Satin entered New York University School of Law in 1992, he expressed no desire to abandon his project of helping to construct a post-liberal, post-Marxist ideology. [...] He did admit to being disillusioned with his approach. [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>my</b> views (and I personally) would benefit from engagement with the real world of commerce and professional ambition", he wrote.|$|E

500|$|In 1965 she {{attempted}} to find her father, and wrote him a letter explaining her situation, but the letter was returned marked [...] "insufficient address". She never gave up the hope of finding him and when, in 1990, she moved to Berlin, she met people who offered to help her trace her father and that side of her family. In 1993, {{at the age of}} 46, she finally met her father and his large American family in Chicago, where she was welcomed and accepted as an equal. Hügel-Marshall later said [...] "here is my journey's end", referring to the meeting, adding [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>my</b> survival in a white racist society was not for nothing". He died the following year.|$|E
500|$|On 9 January 1999, Arsenal {{were held}} to a {{stalemate}} by Liverpool; Wenger, commenting on the performance was disappointed about Liverpool's approach, adding: [...] "Usually we create chances and don't score, but today we just didn't create chances." [...] A headed goal by Martin Keown, from a Petit corner earned Arsenal a 1–0 win the following week, away to Nottingham Forest. Against Chelsea {{on the final day}} of January, Arsenal won 1–0 at Highbury to end the visitors 21-game unbeaten run in the Premier League. Wenger hailed the performance, saying [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>my</b> players were ready. After a few years you just know. It's like working for the weather forecast: you have a feeling whether it will rain or not." ...|$|E
500|$|Back at the Royal Court in 1971 Richardson {{starred in}} John Osborne's West of Suez, after which, in July 1972, he {{surprised}} many by joining Peggy Ashcroft in a drawing-room comedy, Lloyd George <b>Knew</b> <b>My</b> Father by William Douglas-Home. Some critics felt {{the play was}} too slight for its two stars, but Harold Hobson thought Richardson found unsuspected depths {{in the character of}} the ostensibly phlegmatic General Boothroyd. The play was a hit with the public, and when Ashcroft left after four months, Celia Johnson took over until May 1973, when Richardson handed over to Andrew Cruickshank in the West End. Richardson afterwards toured the play in Australia and Canada with his wife as co-star. An Australian critic wrote, [...] "The play is a vehicle for Sir Ralph... but the real driver is Lady Richardson." ...|$|E

500|$|O'Gara {{used his}} inaugural {{column for the}} Irish Examiner to comment on his {{decision}} to retire: [...] "I have ambitions {{in the years ahead}} to coach at a high level and, with this in mind, I can confirm now that I will be joining Racing Métro's coaching staff in July. I am trusting my instinct and it is telling me now is the appropriate time to stop (playing). Had I already decided to retire before the (Heineken Cup semi-final) loss in Montpellier last month? I kind of <b>knew.</b> <b>My</b> lads are gone. My boys in the team are gone." [...] Munster Rugby Chief Executive Garrett Fitzgerald also paid tribute to O'Gara: [...] "In wishing Ronan the very best in the future, I’d like to acknowledge the immense contribution he has made to Munster Rugby and indeed rugby in general in Ireland over the course of what has been a fabulous career." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Bill Veeck took much of {{the public}} {{criticism}} for the fiasco, his son Mike suffered repercussions as the actual front-office promoter behind it. [...] Mike Veeck remained with the White Sox until late 1980, when he resigned; his father sold the team to Jerry Reinsdorf soon afterward. [...] He was unable to find a job in baseball for some time after that, leading him to claim that he had been blackballed from the game. For several years, he worked for a jai-alai fronton in Florida, battling alcoholism. As Mike Veeck related, [...] "The second that first guy shimmied down the outfield wall, I <b>knew</b> <b>my</b> life was over!" [...] Mike Veeck has since become an owner of minor league baseball teams. In July 2014 the Charleston RiverDogs, of whom Veeck is president, held a promotion involving the destruction of Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus merchandise. Dahl is still a radio personality in Chicago and also reaches his listeners through podcasting.|$|E
500|$|Korn's bassist Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu came up {{with the}} title Life Is Peachy. The name came from Fieldy's Pee Chee folder. Fieldy often put [...] "Life Is" [...] in front of the brand name, which would humor him. Fieldy said, [...] "I used to doodle all over it [...] I drew long hair on the {{character}} and put guitars in their hands. I used to sketch stuff all the time. I eventually <b>knew</b> <b>my</b> scribbles might someday pay off. I thought that visual would make a really cool album cover." [...] Korn contacted the Pee Chee file folder company and asked for permission to use the file folder's image for an album cover, offering twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), resulting in the company turning the offer down. The name Life Is Peachy was agreed by band members to be a [...] "great" [...] name for the album, and kept the name but didn't add Fieldy's file folder cover.|$|E

500|$|Rowe's {{illness and}} Blanchflower's arrival {{together}} signalled {{the end of}} Ramsey's playing career. Ramsey missed matches during the 1954–55 season through injury, and in April 1955 suffered what he called [...] "a terrible roasting" [...] {{at the hands of}} the Leicester City winger Derek Hogg. After Tottenham ended the season in 16th place, Rowe retired permanently; his deputy Jimmy Anderson took over and appointed Nicholson to his coaching staff. When Ramsey was omitted from a post-season tour of Hungary, despite still being club captain, he realised that his time at Tottenham had come to an end. He had played a total of 250 competitive games for Tottenham in all competitions, across six seasons. [...] "I was 35 years old and obviously concerned about my future," [...] he later wrote. [...] "I really didn't know what was going to happen to me. I <b>knew</b> <b>my</b> days as a player were numbered, and there was only one way things could go for me in this respect—downhill." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{claimed that}} [...] "Monolith forges new shooter {{territory}} with some truly freaky elements, challenge, fun, and beauty." [...] GameSpy praised the game's plot, later awarding it their [...] "Best Story" [...] Game of the Year award. The New York Times thought differently, stating [...] "I was never quite clear {{on what was}} going on in the game. I <b>knew</b> <b>my</b> goal—track down a psychic, escort a corporate executive's daughter out of danger—but I didn't ever care who these people were nor did I understand their motives." [...] The game has also received criticism for its system requirements, which called for an extremely powerful PC for its time. The Xbox 360 port has also received positive reviews, almost as favorable as the PC version. The multiplayer and instant-action mode were praised for better gameplay, but the control scheme was negatively viewed. Reviews have also stated that it lacked bonus features, despite the new mission included in the game. GameSpot gave the game 8.6. while IGN rated it 9.1 ...|$|E
500|$|On Tuesday 27 February 2007, Saprang led a 13-member {{delegation}} to Europe, {{on what was}} {{claimed to be a}} week-long trip to study safety and security measures at major European airports. [...] Many delegates and accompanying members shared the same surname, and the trip, which cost 7.2 million baht was attacked for [...] "squandering" [...] state funds for personal pleasure, disbursing unrealistic expenses, and inflating costs. [...] The travel agent along received a 500,000 baht commission fee for booking the trip. [...] Saprang denied any wrongdoing and claimed he was the victim of a smear campaign. [...] He also noted that [...] "If you <b>knew</b> <b>my</b> character, you would know that even if a relative joined the trip he should have realised that he should work hard." [...] He also noted that instead of being a viewed as a defendant, he should be viewed as a hero for bringing down the Thaksin government. [...] Saprang then summoned the leader of the AoT labor union in order to identify who leaked information about the trip to his accusers.|$|E

500|$|... "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] {{is written}} about divorce {{from the point}} of view of a {{helpless}} child. Its heavier sound was inspired by bands the group's members were listening to in the two weeks they wrote their fourth album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, such as Fugazi and Refused. Primarily written by guitarist Tom DeLonge, the song is biographical in nature. He and bassist Mark Hoppus were growing up when their parents divorced. For Hoppus, he was eight years old when he was sent to live with his father. [...] "The thing you realize as you get older is that parents don’t know what the hell they’re doing and neither will you when you get to be a parent. You’ve just got to understand that people are human and they make mistakes," [...] he said. DeLonge remembered learning of his parents' divorce when he discovered scrape marks on the driveway of their home. [...] "Right then, I <b>knew</b> <b>my</b> dad had dragged out his furniture single-handedly," [...] he recalled. He spoke on the song's inspiration in 2001: ...|$|E
500|$|In late August, Augusta Saint-Gaudens sent {{new models}} for the eagle to Acting Director Preston. [...] When Barber {{examined}} them, he noted, [...] "dies made from these models {{would be a great}} improvement over those already made" [...] and stated that with these models, the Mint could have the eagle in full production within a month. [...] Homer Saint-Gaudens, the sculptor's son, wrote to Preston, [...] "Mr. Hering has finally finished the eagle at a relief slightly lower than that on the French [...] coin by Chaplin, [...] which is the lowest relief that Mr. Hering <b>knew</b> <b>my</b> father would abide by, and which I understand Mr. Barber can mint." [...] In the meantime, Cortelyou ordered 500 pieces struck on the Mint's high-pressure medal press from the dies the Mint had from Saint-Gaudens's earlier efforts, thus complying with the letter of the President's August 7 order. [...] Preston sent a note to Norris, warning that the President would likely order 100pieces and suggesting that he have the coins available [...] "so you can furnish them without a moment's delay". [...] According to numismatic historian Roger Burdette, [...] "these were an 'insurance policy', put in place by Cortelyou against additional presidential rage". [...] The President viewed sample eagle coins on August 31, and expressed his satisfaction with them and his desire to see more struck.|$|E
