Fuel cells produce electricity with a {{reaction of the}} fuel (hydrogen) and air. Fuel cells {{have the advantage of}} being clean; only producing water and heat as by products. The efficiency of a fuel cell varies depending on the type; SOFC with CHP for example, can have a system efficiency of up to 65 %. What the Authors present here is a comparison between three different configurations of flow plates of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell, the manufacturer’s serpentine <b>flow</b> <b>plate</b> and two new configurations; the maze <b>flow</b> <b>plate</b> and the parallel <b>flow</b> <b>plate.</b> A study of the input parameters affecting output responses of voltage, current, power and efficiency of a fuel cell is performed through experimentation. The results were taken from direct readings of the fuel cell and from polarisation curves produced. This information was then analysed through a design of experiment to investigate the effects of the changing parameters on different configurations of the fuel cell’s flow plates. The results indicate that, in relation to current and voltage response of the polarisation curve and the corresponding graphs produced from the DOE, the serpentine <b>flow</b> <b>plate</b> design is a much more effective design than the maze or parallel <b>flow</b> <b>plate</b> design. It was noted that the parallel <b>flow</b> <b>plate</b> performed reasonably well at higher pressures but over all statically the serpentine <b>flow</b> <b>plate</b> performed better...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{undertaken in}} this thesis {{is concerned with the}} design and development of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells and provides a body of information for continued PEM fuel cell development, which will ideally aid in the future commercialisation of these electrochemical devices. Through a combination of numerical analysis, computational fluid dynamic modelling and experimental work, effective <b>flow</b> <b>plate</b> designs, flow field configurations and materials are analysed and new innovative designs are proposed. The <b>flow</b> <b>plate</b> of a PEM fuel cell {{is one of the most}} important structures in these devices. Effective design of the <b>flow</b> <b>plate</b> will aid in the optimisation of PEM fuel cell technology. Due to the low operational temperature of PEM fuel cells, water species can form in the flow field and this can affect their performance. Two phase flow models were used to study this phenomena. These models show how the water flooding in flow field channels can hinder the mass transport if these are not properly designed, leading to reduced performance, increased heat and reduced fuel utilisation. A high speed camera technique in an ex situ apparatus was used to validate the model and water mitigation methods are proposed. From the culmination of the analysis performed a novel application of open pore cellular metal foam as a <b>flow</b> <b>plate</b> material is proposed {{in this thesis}}. A model is developed, to simulate this relatively new material and extensive pressure analysis and flow modelling has been completed using this model. Computational fluid dynamic modelling, with an additional electrochemical PEM fuel cell module, has been carried out on conventional double channel flow plates and open pore cellular foam flow plates. Flow regimes, pressure analysis, water accumulation, oxygen concentration, fuel utilisation, current & voltage curves and cell temperature profiles are analysed. The PEM fuel cell model with open pore cellular metal foam <b>flow</b> <b>plate</b> performs in excess of a 55 % improvement on the current density of the bench mark double serpentine <b>flow</b> <b>plate</b> under the same operating conditions at 0. 7 volts.

The GDL offers mechanical support to the cell and provides the medium for diffusing the reactant gases from the <b>flow</b> <b>plates</b> to the electrolyte enabling the electrochemical reactions, and therefore the energy conversion. At the same time, it has the task of transporting the electrons from the active sites, near to the electrolyte, towards the <b>flow</b> <b>plates.</b> Describing the fluid flow and mass transport phenomena through the GDLs {{is not an easy}} task not only because of their complex geometries, but also because of these phenomena occur at microscale levels.

40|$|In this work, {{we report}} our {{experimental}} {{results of the}} PEM fuel cell with metal foam as flow distributor. These experimental results show {{the characteristics of the}} PEM fuel cell with the metal foam as flow distributor and extend our understanding of the relation between cell performance and mass transport properties into a region of parameters that the conventional PEM unit cell cannot provide. The comparison in polarization curve is made between the PEM unit cell with different metal-foam properties and the PEM unit cell with graphite <b>flow</b> channel <b>plate</b> as <b>flow</b> distributor. The experimental results show that the PEM fuel cell with metal foam as flow distributor possesses some unique characteristics compared with the conventional PEM unit cell with <b>flow</b> channel <b>plate</b> as <b>flow</b> distributor. The unique characteristics are listed in this paper with our preliminary analysis. Due to the high porosity of metal-foam (as high as 95 %) plus convective flow through the metal-foam, mass transport limitation phenomenon is not as pronounced {{as in the case of}} conventional PEM unit cell with <b>flow</b> channel <b>plate</b> as <b>flow</b> distributor. Another interesting phenomenon is that electrical conductivity of metal-foam plays a significant role in performance, which is seldom the case in the conventional PEM unit cell with <b>flow</b> channel <b>plate</b> as <b>flow</b> distributor.

40|$|AbstractA bipolar {{plate is}} one of the primary {{components}} in a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer which contributes to its hydrogen production efficiency. Its primary function is to distribute the flow of a fluid, in this case water, evenly over the active area of an electrolyzer cell. A well designed and optimized bipolar plate is required to produce an efficient and cost effective PEM electrolyzer stack. In this paper optimal <b>flow</b> <b>plate</b> design and computer models of several available <b>flow</b> <b>plate</b> designs were constructed, and then run through a numerical simulation to evaluate both the hydrodynamic properties they exhibited, the velocity field and pressure gradients. Results indicate that under the specified conditions, the pressure gradient decreases diagonally along the bipolar plate, from the inlet to the outlet. However, the sharpness, or evenness of the pressure gradient varies depending on the design of the bipolar plate. The velocity fields also follow the same general trend, only that they increase in magnitude as they approach the outlet rather than decrease. However, the magnitude of their velocity {{in the middle of the}} plates, especially in some of the designs, such as in the multi-pass serpentine designs, varies randomly within a certain range rather than decreasing or increasing evenly, it is only at the outlet that the velocity gradient becomes more consistent. However, of all the designs evaluated the parallel flow field stands out as a very suitable design for use, due to its ability to maintain operational pressures above 1 MPa through its entire flow field and also, due to its ability to maintain a stable flow velocity between 3 - 5 m/s, both characteristics which were not displayed by the other two designs. In addition, the parallel flow field design was also able to maintain a average Reynolds number close to the critical value or RE= 4000, thus minimizing its internal turbulence...|$|E
