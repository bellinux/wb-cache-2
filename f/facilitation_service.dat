40|$|There is an {{on-going}} {{recognition of}} the need for facilitation to support different group settings. However, the skills and expertise required to successfully facilitate a group of participants to achieve their goal is a challenging task to achieve. There are a number of barriers towards facilitation: A facilitator needs to operate at many different levels at the same time; understand the politics within the group; encourage interaction within the group; and guide participants through tasks and activities, while balancing the needs of the group and the client to reach real outcomes. One of the key competences of a facilitator is flexibility, to adapt to varying circumstances. The complexity and dynamic nature of delivering an appropriate and effective <b>facilitation</b> <b>service</b> makes it therefore difficult to assess the facilitator’s performance in any facilitated session. In this paper we describe a framework {{in the form of an}} artefact developed to aid the facilitators in assessing their own performance in different meetings. <b>Facilitation</b> <b>Service</b> Assessment Framework (FSAF) allows facilitators to define metrics and measures in the context of facilitator’s goals. The assessment framework consists of a structure and a process which facilitators use to apply the framework to facilitation scenarios. Finally, the paper describes how experts evaluated FSAF in alternative scenarios by running a survey and then by conducting interviews...|$|E

Instead, the question is more about understanding how to adopt the process of value co-creation in novel working environments.

40|$|The {{liberalization}} of Australia’s economy {{began in the}} 1980 ’s by the abolition of protectionist trade barriers. Changes to tariff barriers and duty rates {{had a significant impact}} on international trade <b>facilitation</b> <b>service</b> providers, such as licenced customs brokers. In Australia, to operate as a custom broker, an individual must firstly complete a course of study prescribed under the Australian Customs Act 1901, and additionally pass a national examination. This paper discusses the introduction of a revised national customs brokers course, and in particular the development of an e-learning method of delivery by a private education provider. The main benefits and possible shortfalls of the specific e-learning approach pursued are outlined, together with a summary of feedback from students across a number of units of study. The paper concludes that the e-learning approach offered through this course of study may assist in the development of communities of practice, thereby potentially offering additional benefits to those available through traditional classroom based studies...|$|E
40|$|More than 1, 180, 000 {{people use}} several {{thousand}} coworking spaces these days, but {{the running of}} coworking spaces is a rather fragile business model. Coworking spaces need entrepreneurial sustainability as well. Therefore, this study identifies success factors for sustainable business through analysis of users and hosts’ demands and priorities about coworking spaces. To identify the priorities, we conducted a questionnaire survey with 60 hosts and 56 users by using the analytic hierarchy process method. We found that hosts thought community and communication most important, followed by space and interior, service diversity, and price plan, and users considered relationship facilitation the most important, followed by service diversity, price plan, and networking event and party. After discussions with coworking space hosts and users to understand the differences in viewpoints, we combined the results to find the highest priorities. Finally, we identified relationship <b>facilitation,</b> <b>service</b> diversity, and price plan as having the highest priorities for sustainable coworking space operation for both sides. This study has major implications for research into improving management of coworking spaces as it asks users and hosts to select and focus on elements of priority in their decision making for entrepreneurial sustainability and management innovation...|$|E

EDOS 2 ̆ 7 s mandate is to facilitate intake to the specialist inpatient and outpatient services at the Royal Brisbane and Women 2 ̆ 7 s Hospital (RBWH) and to provide eating disorders education and consultation liaison to clinicians statewide. Method: EDOS provides services in four key areas: intake <b>facilitation,</b> <b>service</b> development, education and training, and consultation liaison. Each area is described in detail. Results: EDOS has grown since its inception to currently comprise a full-time team manager and a number of specialist clinician positions in psychiatry, nursing, dietetics, social work and psychology. The Service has become an integral part of the RBWH Adult Eating Disorders Service, providing statewide assessment and treatment recommendations, consultation liaison services and specialist intervention programs. Conclusions: EDOS has been successful in facilitating patient access to local general medical and psychiatric facilities. EDOS also plays a significant leadership role in the development of effective statewide networking forums for clinicians and key stakeholders, in inservice delivery and in the provision of evidence-based educational opportunities, each of which has contributed to improved access to services for eating disorder patients...|$|E

We present a review of a service provision model which has provided improved access to abortion care; support for complex issues experienced by women seeking nonjudgmental family planning health services; and a mechanism to collect information on access barriers. The toll-free pregnancy options service (POS) of British Columbia Women’s Hospital and Health Centre sought to improve access to services and overcome barriers experienced by women seeking abortion. Methods. We describe {{the development and implementation of}} a province-wide toll-free telephone counseling and access <b>facilitation</b> <b>service,</b> including establishment of a provincial network of local abortion service providers in the Canadian province of British Columbia from 1998 to 2010. Results.

Conclusion. This novel service has been successful in addressing inequities and access barriers identified as priorities before service establishment. The service provided unanticipated benefits to health care planning and monitoring of provincial health care related service delivery and gaps. This model for low cost health service delivery may realize similar benefits when applied to other health care systems where access and referral barriers exist...|$|E

40|$|Briefing, where a {{construction}} client conveys his / her needs and aspirations {{to the design}} team, is described as {{the first and most}} important step in the process of delivering a building or other physical infrastructure. Due to the significant commitment of resources, it is recommended that clients carefully define and examine their needs in terms of project requirements, before and during briefing. Nevertheless, briefing is subject to many practical limitations. Many clients may overlook important aspects of briefing and various problems such as delays and cost overruns may ensue. Although the literature shows a substantial amount of studies that have addressed some briefing problems, briefing is still reported to pose continuing problems in the construction industry. Given the importance of improving the conceptualisation and implementation of briefing, a 'collaborative briefing approach' was developed in this study to improve the briefing process and its outputs, with particular reference to large-scale infrastructure projects, which involve multiple interfaces with many stakeholders. The above approach is designed to empower the traditionally mobilised briefing team to work collaboratively with a large group of multi-disciplinary stakeholders as an integrated briefing team {{in the form of a}} virtual organisation through a shared digital workspace created on a computer network. The workspace enables all members to work together remotely and asynchronously so as to achieve greater stakeholder participation in briefing. Since stakeholders contribute in bringing professional knowledge, experience and creativity to briefing, the enhanced stakeholder participation will increase their inputs and result in more fruitful briefing outputs. In this study, a comprehensive survey was first conducted to investigate and compare the strengths and weaknesses of common briefing practices in the Hong Kong construction industry, so as to establish a theoretical foundation for the research. An ‘Integrated Collaborative Briefing Methodology’ (INTERCOM) was developed to translate the described approach into a set of actionable methods and job plans for practical use. The INTERCOM comprises of five components: (i) a value based briefing methodology, (ii) a collaborative briefing job plan, (iii) an integrated briefing team, (iv) a collaborative briefing platform, and (v) <b>facilitation</b> <b>service.</b> The first four components were developed and validated by a group of well experienced multi-disciplinary industry practitioners. The fifth component merits a separate research and development exercise. The validation results reveal that the concept of collaborative briefing approach and the design of the INTERCOM methodology were well supported by the practitioners. In addition, it was concluded that the methodology would contribute to improve the briefing process by facilitating team management, enhancing requirement definition and promoting consensus building. It also improved requirement comprehensiveness, decision transparency, decision reliability, and decision satisfaction, as well as the value and quantity of the requirements specified in the brief. The validation also highlights some practical limitations including potential political barriers, time constraints, specialist facilitator and resources limitations. Moreover, the net benefits of the developed ‘collaborative briefing approach’ are concluded to be very worthwhile, both in principle and for practical purposes. The additional significance of this study is that it researched and developed a "panoramic view" of briefing practices from a practical perspective, linked the knowledge of briefing to the domain of collaboration through a “collaborative briefing approach” and developed the framework for a new generation of ICT systems for supporting and substantially improving the briefing process. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

We analyse their implications, using a CGEmodel. Besides the “usual suspects” (tariffs, subsidies, and service barriers) and trade facilitation, we address non-tariff-measures (NTM) in a separate scenario. We find that reforms would substantially boost national income and trade, especially for the group of emerging economies. Income gains are primarily due to elimination of dead-weight losses caused by rules and regulations and improved resource allocation. Jointly, the simulations indicate a move towards services and industrial production and exports. trade liberalisation, CGE, trade <b>facilitation,</b> <b>services,</b> NTM, NTB, Baltic Sea...|$|R

30|$|Another {{important}} policy {{recommendation that}} emerges from this analysis is that a stronger effort to reduce industry concentration, and to increase exports, could {{go a long way}} in improving women’s prospects in the labor market, both in terms of relative wages and employment. Industry concentration in general was associated with higher gender wage gaps, and when those concentrated industries were made to face increased international competition, they had both falling wage gaps and rising female employment over this period. This suggests that stronger antitrust legislation can reduce discrimination to begin with, while opening up to trade can further reduce the ability of employers that already have market power to discriminate. Additionally, higher exports were associated with a lower residual wage gap in the non-concentrated industries. Policies that promote Egyptian exports overseas, such as production subsidies, tax exceptions and special credit lines, government provision of trade <b>facilitation</b> <b>services</b> and help with marketing, can therefore help improve women’s labor market outcomes, even in the non-concentrated industries.|$|R
