5|$|One <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> BCal's {{interest}} in Concorde {{was that the}} British Government's 1976 aviation policy review had opened the possibility of BA setting up supersonic services in competition with BCal's established sphere of influence. To counteract this potential threat, BCal considered their own independent Concorde plans, {{as well as a}} partnership with BA. BCal were considered most likely to have set up a Concorde service on the Gatwick–Lagos route, a major source of revenue and profits within BCal's scheduled route network; BCal's Concorde task force did assess the viability of a daily supersonic service complementing the existing subsonic widebody service on this route.|$|E

25|$|However, this varied handcraft {{tradition}} faces challenges. Like {{other areas}} of Mexico, handcrafted goods must compete against cheaper, commercially made products and cheaper imitations. One problem that many artisans have, especially those who sell more expensive items such as furniture, is the inability to extend lines of credit. Michoacan artisans lack access to markets to sell and avenues to promote their products. One main market to which these artisans lack access is the tourism industry, valuable to other states in Mexico such as Oaxaca. One <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the lack of tourism is security concerns. As of 2012 11,640 artisans worked in the state, but most have income below the poverty line.|$|E
25|$|By the 17th century, the {{military}} {{value of the}} pospolite ruszenie was very limited, and was last called {{to participate in the}} Battle of Warsaw of 1656 during The Deluge (the battle ended with a Polish defeat). Nonetheless, the szlachta continued to believe they formed an elite army, and that their participation in the defense of the country was an <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> their privileged position in it. As this was used as a justifications for lower taxation, the Commonwealth treasury found itself increasingly starved for funds to pay to regular, standing army. With the Commonwealth Army reduced by that time to around 16,000, it was easy for its neighbors to overpower its armies (the Imperial Russian Army numbered 300,000; the Prussian Army and Imperial Austrian Army, 200,000).|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s, Hungary {{were not}} able to qualify for any {{international}} tournaments save for the 1996 Summer Olympics held in Atlanta. The 1980s were considered as the most bitter years of the Hungarian football, but the 1990s proved to be the worst. In 1996, Hungary reached its lowest FIFA World Raking, 87th. The fall of the Hungarian Communist regime caused financial problems to many Hungarian clubs. Formerly successful clubs like Ferencváros and Újpest faced financial crisis and bankruptcy. This {{had a profound effect on}} the Hungarian national team as well since earlier the biggest clubs from Budapest (Ferencváros, Újpest, Honvéd and MTK) produced the players for the national side. Another <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the decline can be attributed to the Bosman ruling.

Collective wage agreements and implicit contracts are <b>important</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> wage rigidities for the low skilled.

25|$|In the Union of Brest of 1596 (colloquially {{known as}} unia), {{a part of}} the Ukrainian Church was {{accepted}} {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Roman Pope, becoming a Byzantine Rite Catholic Church, a Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, colloquially known as the Uniate Church. While the new church gained many faithful among the Ukrainians in Galicia, the majority of Ukrainians in the rest of the lands remained within Eastern Orthodoxy with the church affairs ruled by then from Kiev under the metropolitan Peter Mogila (Petro Mogyla). The Orthodox Church was made illegal (its legality was partially restored in 1607), its property confiscated, and Orthodox believers faced persecution and discrimination which became an <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> large numbers of Ukrainians to emigrate to Tsardom of Russia following the Union. The eastward spread of the Union of Brest led to violent clashes, for example, assassination of the Greek Catholic metropolitan Josaphat Kuntsevych by the Orthodox mob in Polotsk in 1623.|$|E
25|$|Although the Qajars were victorious and Agha Mohammad Khan {{kept his}} promise to Heraclius (Erekle) that if he would not drop the {{alliance}} with Russia and voluntarily reaccept Iranian suzerainty they would invade his kingdom, it also showed that Russia's own ambitions and agenda were set as the most <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> Russia not to intervene at Krtsanisi, even though the latter had officially declared in the Treaty of Georgievsk of 1783 that it would protect Erekle's kingdom against any new Iranian ambitions to re-subjugate Georgia. Subsequently, in order to restore Russian prestige, Catherine would launch a punitive campaign against Iran the next year, but it was shortly recalled after her death. The following years remained turbulent and were known as a time of muddle and confusion. Reestablishment of Iranian rule over Georgia did not last long, for the shah was assassinated in 1797 in Shusha, and the Georgian king had died the year after. With Georgia laying in ruins and the central rule in Iran being concerned with the next heir to the throne, it {{opened the way for}} Georgia's annexation by Russia several years later by Tsar Paul.|$|E
25|$|Kulothunga Chola III {{apparently}} {{failed to}} notice that the Pandya princes, who always administered their territory by dividing it among themselves, {{were more or less}} united at most times, though they did not have the military strength to overwhelm and overcome the Cholas in war. This was also due to the Pandyas also not having a strong leadership who could mobilize his resources and forces so as to carve out a niche or distinct identity as a powerful kingdom in South India. However, it appears there was a change in approach of the, Cholas, who from the times of Kulothunga Chola I, adopted a policy of letting the defeated kings to rule without there being a Chola representative to administer those provinces despite subjugating the Pandyas and Cheras in South India. This policy reversed the practice followed mainly from the times of Raja Raja Chola I and his son Rajendra Chola I who, after defeating the Pandyas and conquering Madurai, sent a Chola prince to directly rule the Pandya country with the royal titles Chola-Pandyan. 'After the conquest of the Pandya country by Kulothunga Chola I, the princes of the local royal family were allowed to rule as they liked, subject to the vague suzerainty of the Cholas'. An <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> this was the involvement of the Chola kings in the periodic but many a times fierce succession disputes that arose among the Pandya princes leading 'to the intervention of the Chola and Sinhalese rulers on opposite sides, which brought no good to either' kingdom. One such prominent war in the Pandyan country took place 'soon after the installation of Rajadhiraja Chola II(11631178 CE)', and 'out of the ashes of this civil war arose the Pandya power which in its renewed strength soon swallowed both the Chola and Ceylonese kingdoms'.|$|E

500|$|If Balzac's {{goal was}} (as he claimed) {{to write a}} realist novel from his [...] "own old pen" [...] rather than mimic the style of Eugène Sue, history and {{literary}} criticism have declared him successful. William Stowe calls La Cousine Bette [...] "a masterpiece of classical realism" [...] and Bellos refers to it as [...] "one of the great achievements of nineteenth-century realism", comparing it to War and Peace. Some sections of the book are criticized for being melodramatic, and Balzac biographer V. S. Pritchett even refers to a representative excerpt as [...] "bad writing". Most critics, however, consider the moralistic elements of the novel deceptively complex, and some {{point out that the}} roman-feuilleton format required a certain level of titillation to keep readers engaged. Others indicate that Balzac's interest in the theatre was an <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the inclusion of melodramatic elements.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, Tho was also {{becoming}} unpopular {{in the military}} establishment. One {{of the goals of}} the coup plots at the time was to remove Tho and the prime minister's unpopularity helped to distract some of the incumbent officers from {{the fact that they were}} the primary target—at the time, the MRC was moving towards removing Tho, and Minh was the only senior general to still have confidence in him. A more <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the incumbent generals' lack of preparedness for Khánh's coup was their misunderstanding of the US stance. After what had happened to Diệm, as well as other failed coup attempts, they regarded American backing as the decisive factor for the survival of any government and the success of any coup. As a result, repeated assurances from Lodge and Johnson's laudatory comments in private and public convinced them that they remained on firm ground. Johnson had told Lodge to assure Minh in a meeting on January 1, 1964, that he had [...] "the complete support of the United States as the leader of Vietnam [...] ".|$|E
500|$|By 1964, {{the country}} was a {{constitutional}} monarchy ruled by Sultan Jamshid bin Abdullah. Zanzibar had a population of around 230,000 Africans—some of whom claimed Persian ancestry and were known locally as Shirazis—and also contained significant minorities in the 50,000 Arabs and 20,000 South Asians who were prominent in business and trade. The various ethnic groups were becoming mixed and the distinctions between them had blurred; according to one historian, an <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the general support for Sultan Carbou was his family's ethnic diversity. However, the island's Arab inhabitants, as the major landowners, were generally wealthier than the Africans; the major political parties were organised largely along ethnic lines, [...] with Arabs dominating the Zanzibar Nationalist Party (ZNP) and Africans the Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP). The ZNP looked towards Egypt as its model, which caused some tensions with the British colonial officials, but Zanzibar had been for centuries dominated by its Arab elite, and the Colonial Office could not imagine a Zanzibar ruled by the blacks. After Zanzibar had been conquered by the Sultanate of Oman in 1698, all {{of the land in}} the countryside had been given to Omani aristocratic families, whose descendants still owned the land in 1964. Though not all of the Arabs were as wealthy as the families who owned the clove and coconut plantations, the resentment felt by the poor African farmers who worked the plantations acquired a racialized tinge, especially as in a small island like Zanzibar, {{it was easy to see}} the contrast in wealth between the land-owning Arab families and their poor African tenants.|$|E
