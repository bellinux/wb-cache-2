50|$|The WHO {{believes}} that another influenza pandemic is {{as likely to}} occur {{at any time since}} 1968, when the last century's third of three pandemics took place. The WHO describes a series of six phases, starting with the <b>inter-pandemic</b> <b>period,</b> where there are no new influenza virus subtypes detected in humans, and progressing numerically to the pandemic period, where there is efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus in the general population.At the present moment, we are at phase 3 on the scale, meaning a new influenza virus subtype is causing disease in humans, but is not yet spreading efficiently and sustainably among humans.|$|E
40|$|AbstractInfluenza {{is common}} in infants and children: attack rates vary from 23 % to 48 % each year during <b>inter-pandemic</b> <b>periods,</b> and are even higher during pandemics. Severe cases occur more {{frequently}} in children with underlying chronic diseases; however, epidemiological studies have clearly shown that influenza also causes an excess of medical examinations, drug prescriptions and hospitalizations in otherwise healthy children (particularly those aged < 5 years), {{as well as a}} considerable number of paediatric deaths. Childhood influenza also has a number of social and economic consequences. However, many European health authorities are still reluctant to include influenza vaccinations in their national vaccination programmes for healthy children because, among other things, there are doubts concerning their real ability to evoke a protective immune response, especially in children {{in the first years of}} life. New hope for the solution of these problems has come from the introduction of vaccines containing more antigens and the possibility of intradermal administration. However, further studies are needed to establish whether universal influenza vaccination in the first years of life should be recommended, and with which vaccine...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentration}} of eleven antibiotics (trimethoprim, oxytetracycline, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, cefotaxime, doxycycline, sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin), three decongestants (naphazoline, oxymetazoline, xylometazoline) and the antiviral drug oseltamivir’s active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), were measured weekly at 21 locations within the River Thames catchment in England {{during the month}} of November 2009, the autumnal peak of the influenza A[H 1 N 1]pdm 09 pandemic. The aim was to quantify the pharmaceutical response to the pandemic and compare this to drug use during the late pandemic (March 2010) and the <b>inter-pandemic</b> <b>periods</b> (May 2011). A large and small wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) were sampled in November 2009 to understand the differential fate of the analytes in the two WWTPs prior to their entry in the receiving river and to estimate drug users using a wastewater epidemiology approach. Mean hourly OC concentrations in the small and large WWTP’s influent were 208 and 350 ng/L (max, 2070 and 550 ng/L, respectively). Erythromycin was the most concentrated antibiotic measured in Benson and Oxford WWTPs influent (max = 6, 870 and 2, 930 ng/L, respectively). Napthazoline and oxymetazoline were the most frequently detected and concentrated decongestant in the Benson WWTP influent (1650 and 67 ng/L) and effluent (696 and 307 ng/L), respectively, but were below detection in the Oxford WWTP. OC was found in 73 % of November 2009 ’s weekly river samples (max = 193 ng/L), but only in 5 % and 0 % of the late- and inter-pandemic river samples, respectively. The mean river {{concentration of}} each antibiotic during the pandemic largely fell between 17 – 74 ng/L, with clarithromycin (max = 292 ng/L) and erythromycin (max = 448 ng/L) yielding the highest single measure. In general, the concentration and frequency of detecting antibiotics in the river increased during the pandemic. OC was uniquely well-suited for the wastewater epidemiology approach owing to its nature as a prodrug, recalcitrance and temporally- and spatially-resolved prescription statistics...|$|R
