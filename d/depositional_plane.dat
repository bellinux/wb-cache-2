40|$|Prokaryotes, often {{generally}} {{referred to}} as “bacteria,” are the original and thus oldest life on Earth. They have shaped the chemical environment of the Earth, but they are difficult to find as ancient fossils due to their subtle structure. Here we report well-preserved fossilized microbial communities in silicified bitumen concretions from unit 3 of the Xiamaling Formation (1. 39 [*]Ga) in northern China. The numerous silicified bitumen concretions are {{in a variety of}} forms including ellipsoidal, spindle, and pancake ones, with diameters of 1 ~ 16 [*]cm and thicknesses of 0. 5 ~ 3 [*]cm. The principal planes of the concretions are at low angle or directly parallel to the <b>depositional</b> <b>plane</b> level, showing obvious depositional characteristics. The concretions are silicified with abundant bitumen inside. Many different kinds of microbial fossils are found in the bitumen, including spherical forms, rods, and filaments, and some of the microbes are aggregated together in the forms of multicellular structures. These concretions preserve a delicate Mesoproterozoic biotic community...|$|E
40|$|Extended UH {{model is}} a {{three-dimensional}} elastoplastic constitutive model that builds on a modification of the UH model with a unified hardening parameter, {{to account for the}} effect of anisotropy and the influence of K- 0 consolidation on the stress-strain-strength behavior of clays. The combined effects of anisotropy and stress magnitude are considered through the minimum value of angles (alpha) made by the spatially mobilized planes (SMPs) and soil <b>depositional</b> <b>plane.</b> The original transformed stress tensor is revised by incorporating the anisotropic peak stress ratio M-alpha, which is defined as a function of alpha, with the stress tensor sigma(ij). The comparison with test results on San Francisco Bay Mud demonstrates the capability of the proposed anisotropic criterion. The UH model is extended to account for the combined effects of inherent anisotropy and K- 0 conditions on the stress-strain-strength response of anisotropic clays by incorporating the revised transformed stress tensor (sigma(ij)) over tilde, the potential strength ratio M-f, the characteristic stress ratio M, and the state stress ratio (eta) over tilde (a). A series of undrained triaxial tests on isotropically and anisotropically consolidated specimens with different overconsolidation ratios (OCRs) are successfully predicted using the proposed extended UH model. New parameters for anisotropic soils can be determined conveniently from the conventional triaxial compression tests on vertical and horizontal specimens.

40|$|Mining {{activities}} in the US Western Phosphate Resource Area (WPRA) have released Se into the environment. Selenium has several different oxidation states and species, each having varying degrees of solubility, reactivity, and bioavailability. In this study we are investigating the speciation of Se in mine-waste rocks. Selenium speciation was determined using bulk and micro-x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), as well as micro-x-ray fluorescence mapping. Rocks used for bulk-XAS were ground into fine powders. Shale used for micro-XAS was broken along <b>depositional</b> <b>planes</b> to expose unweathered surfaces. The near edge region of the XAS spectra (XANES) for the bulk rock samples revealed multiple oxidation states, with peaks indicative of Se(-II), Se(IV), and Se(+VI) species. Micro-XANES analysis of the shale indicated that three unique Se-bearing species were present. Using the XANES data together with ab initio fitting of the extended x-ray absorption fine structure region of the micro-XAS data (micro-EXAFS) the three Se-bearing species were identified as dzharkenite, a di-selenide carbon compound, and Se-substituted pyrite. Results from this research will allow for {{a better understanding of}} the biogeochemical cycling of Se in the WPRA. </p...|$|R
40|$|Mangroves are {{a coastal}} marine environment, {{characteristically}} biomass-dominated by trees. They support a high biodiversity of marine and terrestrial biota, {{as well as}} providifig a haven for estuarine fauna, and a nursery ground for other fauna ranging from flying foxes and seabirds, to offshore fish and crustaceans. The uses and benefits of mangroves equate to our direct use {{of some of these}} biota but it also includes other indirect benefits such as protection of coastal foreshores and estuarine margins from erosion. Mangrove environments in, and adjacent to, the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area are in relatively good condition, although there are clear indications that pressures on them are increasing rapidly. Localised impacts are accumulating to a point where large areas, once thought to be able to withstand change, are now threatened. And, detrimental changes appear to exceed societies’ current responses to protect mangrove environments and to reduce the overall impact of the growing number of smaller impacts. Human activities affect the establishment, growth, survival and biodiversity of mangrove plants, and their impacts range from: direct removal and damage of mangrove plants; conversion of mangrove lands to other uses; construction of breakwaters and other alterations to water courses and local hydrology affecting <b>depositional</b> <b>planes</b> and sediment levels; changes to air and water quality as increased dust, turbidity, temperature and the addition of chemicals; catastrophic events of pollution bringing long-term impacts like large oil spills; and the introduction of exotic pests and pathogens from land and sea sources. Pressures on mangrove environments are real, and there is an increasing obligation on environmental management authorities to clearly describe coastal and estuarine areas according to the best scientific advice. Based on these descriptions, the next step would be to apply protection status, and in particular, designating specific areas for total protection with surrounding areas as buffers. There has never been such a profound urgency to have coastal management plans in place if we wish to preserve rare natural stands, especially adjacent to more populated areas in the region. The obligation on management authorities extends to their taking a leading role in advising Governments on the uniqueness, fragility, vulnerability and ecological tolerance of mangrove ecosystems, as well as on their benefits. And, once management authorities and all interest groups have made decisions about which areas are to be preserved, future development proposals cannot be a matter of compromise between special action groups and developers since it is the environment we wish to preserve which ultimately must determine where the limits of change are set. In appreciation of the urgency, it is also recommended that we continue to fill gaps in our knowledge and understanding of mangrove forests by further supporting long-term monitoring programs investigating, in particular: ecological processes; loss of mangrove area; and the restoration of damaged mangrove stands.

40|$|The Cenomanian ammonitefaunas of the Munster Basin are {{systematically}} and stratigraphically revised. They comprise 75 species, {{referred to}} 33 genera. In addition to SCHLUTER's (1871 - 1876) type-material, the specimens figured by WIEDMANN AND SCHNEIDER (1979) and KAPLAN, KELLER AND WIEDMANN (1985) are redescribed and partially refigured. The ammonites occur in four different facies associations: the arenaceous glauconitic Essen-Greensand in the west, the red limestone pocket of Muhlheim-Broich within the Essen Greensand <b>depositional</b> area, the <b>Planer</b> limestone-facies in the east, and chalks {{in the north}} of the Munster basin. The ammonite occurrences are described in the context of biostratigraphy, of regional lithostratigraphy, sequence stratigraphy, and cyclostratigraphy. The ammonite zones recognized are closely comparable to those of the Anglo Paris basin, especially these of southern England. The bio- and event stratigraphic correlation with the Cenomanian of Poland, Mangyshlak and the Crimea is described and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (DSc) [...] PU for CHE, 1990. The {{well-known}} Archaean {{gold deposit}} on the Witwatersrand is the world's principal {{source of this}} precious metal. A tectonically active hinterland comprising Archaean granite-greenstone terrane and pre-Witwatersrand sediments provided the detritus which was deposited at major points of fluvial influx along the northern and western periphery of the Witwatersrand Basin during the sedimentation of the Central Rand Group. The geochemical characteristics of the environment which prevailed at the earth's surface {{at the time of}} sedimentation can be reconstructed from the response of the detrital constituents to the changes in surficial conditions during the different stages of the exogenic cycle and after burial at the final site of deposition. The information is provided by the following groups of minerals: (1) those that must have been common in the source rocks but are absent in the reefs, (2) constituents that were preserved during the exogenic cycle, including those altered before denudation of the provenance area, and (3) altered or neo-formed products of post-burial origin. The absence of carbonates, sulphides other than pyrite, sulphates, apatite, iron oxides, and primary silicates suggest that the surface conditions during denudation in the provenance area and en route to the depositional environment must have been acid. The silicates that survived the pre-depositional processes or formed soon after deposition were subjected to diagenesis and metamorphism. The metamorphic silicate assemblage: chloritoid-pyrophyllite-chloriteIIb-muscovite 2 M 1, indicates that the sedimentary rocks attained the lower stage of low-grade metamorphism at a temperature below 400 °C and a pressure of about 3 kbar. The thorough elimination of iron oxides and the alteration of ilmenite to leucoxene pseudomorphs by the removal of iron at, or close to the earth's surface was a common process during the Archaean. The dissolution of iron requires neutral to acid conditions, and the required level of acidity increases with an increase in oxidation potential. Detrital uraninite, pyrite, chlorite, and biotite, which react readily under modern (oxidizing) surface conditions, were preserved during the exogenic cycle. Low surface temperatures and rapid erosion and accumulation of large supplies of debris could have delayed the reaction of these oxygen-consuming minerals during denudation, erosion, and transportation. When the detritus arrived at the plane of final deposition, part of the unoxidized uraninite was encapsulated by microbiota, which prevented its reaction, while the remaining portion of uraninite became a constituent of the heavy-mineral assemblage. The common presence of relict uraninite in the matrix of the conglomerates indicates that uranium was dissolved from uraninite which was not shielded by organic matter. The shape of these partly or entirely leached grains was preserved by cutans which precipitated during the removal of uranium. The dissolved uranium was recaptured by dissolved titanium, and the two phases reprecipitated as the uranous titanate species, viz brannerite and uraniferous leucoxene of variable composition. In the Dominion Reef, {{at the base of the}} sedimentary succession that filled the basin, and in some of the reefs near the top of the supergroup, part of the uraninite was transformed in situ to coffinite through the addition of silica, a process which requires an alkaline-reducing environment. Such conditions were found, for example, in stagnant pools on the <b>depositional</b> <b>plane</b> onto which a braided channel pattern developed. Owing to the addition of titania and silica, the neo-formed uranous titanates and coffinite occupied much more space than the original uraninite, hence, the alteration of uraninite and, likewise, the formation of cutans took place at a time that the porosity of the sediment made provision for expansion and for the free circulation of pore solutions, Le. shortly after burial. The missing minerals and the behaviour of ilmenite and the iron oxides indicate that the conditions at the Archaean earth's surface was distinctly acid. It is generally assumed that the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the primitive atmosphere was much higher than it is at present, a condition which must have increased the acidity of the rain water, groundwater and surface waters. Of the oxygen-consuming minerals, only uraninite was oxidized, which implies that the uranium oxide was the most efficient sink for oxygen. The oxidation of uraninite after deposition at the palaeosurface without that of the detrital minerals pyrite, chlorite, and biotite, indicates that only limited amounts of oxygen must have been available at the time of sedimentation.

40|$|Turbidite {{sandstones}} of the Miocene Marnoso-arenacea Formation (northern Apennines, Italy) display centimetre to decimetre long, {{straight to}} gently curved, 0. 5 to 2. 0 cm regularly spaced lineations on <b>depositional</b> (stratification) <b>planes.</b> Sometimes these lineations are the planform expression of sheet structures seen as millimetre to centimetre long vertical ‘pillars’ in profile. Both {{occur in the}} middle and upper parts of medium-grained and fine-grained sandstone beds composed of crude to well-defined stratified facies (including corrugated, hummocky-like, convolute, dish-structured and dune stratification) and are aligned sub-parallel to palaeoflow direction as determined from sole marks often in the same beds. Outcrops lack a tectonic-related fabric and therefore these structures may be confidently interpreted to be sedimentary in origin. Lineations resemble primary current lineation formed by the action of turbulence during bedload transport under upper stage plane bed conditions. However, they typically display a larger spacing and micro-topography compared to classic primary current lineation and are not associated with planar-parallel, finely-laminated sandstones. This type of ‘enhanced lineation’ is interpreted to develop by the same process as primary current lineation, but under relatively high near-bed sediment concentrations and suspended load fallout rates, as supported by laboratory experiments and host facies characteristics. Sheets are interpreted to be dewatering structures and their alignment to palaeoflow (only noted in several other outcrops previously) inferred to be a function of vertical water-escape following the primary depositional grain fabric. For the Marnoso-arenacea beds, sheet orientation may be genetically linked to the enhanced primary current lineation structures. Current-aligned lineation and sheet structures can be used as palaeoflow indicators, although the directional significance of sheets needs to be independently confirmed. These indicators also aid the interpretation of dewatered sandstones, suggesting sedimentation under a traction-dominated depositional flow – with a discrete interface between the aggrading deposit and the flow – as opposed to under higher-concentration grain or hindered settling dominated regimes...|$|R
