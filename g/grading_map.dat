And the safety of urban human settlements and the evaluation are scarcely studied. The safety evaluation index system of urban human settlements was put forward, the safety evaluation model based on the catastrophe theory and GIS technology was built up. And the model was applied in the case study of cities in Sichuan Province. According to the above index and catastrophe progression method, the scoring and ranking of every 17 indicators of the safety evaluation in 18 prefecture-level cities in Sichuan Province were calculated. Finally, the <b>grading</b> <b>map</b> of the safety evaluation of Human Settlements in Sichuan Province was obtained.

Using the vegetation coverage <b>grade</b> <b>maps</b> and the ground slope <b>grade</b> <b>map</b> from a DEM to generate soil erosion <b>grade</b> <b>maps</b> for different years, the soil erosion monitoring was also realized. The results show that {{in the study area}} the vegetation coverage was the lowest in 1976, much better in 1989, but a bit worse again in 2001. Towards the soil erosion, it had been mitigated continuously from 1976 to 1989 and then to 2001. It is interesting that a little decrease of vegetation coverage from 1989 to 2001 did not lead to increase of soil erosion. The reason is that the decrease of vegetation coverage was chiefly caused by urbanization and thus mainly occurred in very gentle terrains, where soil erosion was naturally slight. The results clearly indicate the details of plant cover and soil erosion change in 25 years and also offer a scientific founda tion for plant and soil conservation. </p...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{need for}} goods and passenger transportation drives continued worldwide growth in traffic. As traffic increases environmental concerns, traffic safety, and cost efficiency become ever more important. Advancements in microelectronics {{open the possibility}} {{to address these issues}} through new advanced driver assistance systems. Applications such as predictive cruise control, automated gearbox control, predictive front lighting control, and hybrid vehicle state-of-charge control decrease the energy consumption of vehicles and increase the safety. These control systems can benefit significantly from preview road grade information. This information is currently obtained using specialized survey vehicles, and is not widely available. This thesis proposes new methods to obtain road grade information using on-board sensors. The task of creating road <b>grade</b> <b>maps</b> is addressed by the proposal of a framework where vehicles using a road network collect the necessary data for estimating the road grade. The estimation can then be carried out locally in the vehicle, or {{in the presence of a}} communication link to the infrastructure, centrally. In either case the accuracy of the map increases over time, and costly road surveys can be avoided. This thesis presents a new distributed method for creating accurate road <b>grade</b> <b>maps</b> for vehicle control applications. Standard heavy duty vehicles in normal operation are used to collect measurements. Estimates from multiple passes along a road segment are merged to form a road <b>grade</b> <b>map,</b> which improves each time a vehicle retraces a route. The design and implementation of the road grade estimator are described, and the performance is experimentally evaluated using real vehicles. Three different grade estimation methods, based on different assumption on the road grade signal, are proposed and compared. They all use data from sensors that are standard equipment in heavy duty vehicles. Measurements of the vehicle speed and the engine torque are combined with observations of the road altitude from a GPS receiver, using vehicle and road models. The operation of the estimators is adjusted during gearshifts, braking, and poor satellite coverage, to account for variations in sensor and model reliability. The estimated error covariances of the road grade estimates are used together with their absolute positions to update a stored road <b>grade</b> <b>map.</b> Highway driving trials show that the proposed estimators produce accurate road grade data. The estimation performance improves as the number of road segment traces increases. A vehicle equipped with the proposed system will rapidly develop a road <b>grade</b> <b>map</b> for its area of operation. Simulations show that collaborative generation of the third dimension for a pre-existing large area two-dimensional map is feasible. The experimental results indicate that road grade estimates from the proposed methods are accurate enough to be used in predictive vehicle control systems to enhance safety, efficiency, and driver comfort in heavy duty vehicles. The grade estimators may also be used for on-line validation of road grade information from other sources. This is important in on-board applications, since the envisioned control applications can degrade vehicle performance if inaccurate data are used. QC 2011040...|$|R

Preview grade {{information can be}} used in on-board functions of a heavy duty vehicle such as adaptive lighting, predictive cruise control and gearbox control. These functions have a potential for adding safety, increasing fuel eciency and improving driver comfort. Grade estimation by use of existing inexpensive on-board sensors in heavy vehicles is a promising way of creating and maintaining up-to-date road <b>grade</b> <b>maps</b> with minimal investment. This thesis examines the performance of a recently developed grade estimation method. Simulation is used to test the grade estimation performance in a longer perspective than is possible with the experimental data currently available. Errors are introduced into the simulation model based on interviews and experience from road tests of the estimation method. Fast convergence is seen when many simulated runs are fused into a <b>grade</b> <b>map.</b> Also, experimental data are analyzed and some systematic errors are found in the vehicle model. These errors are not explicitly accounted for in the error model for vehicle data used in the grade estimation method. By comparing grade estimated with the aid of GPS to grade calculated using only vehicle data, corrections to the vehicle model are computed. The eect of these corrections is examined and it is shown that it is feasible to take dynamic parameter errors into account in an estimation method with a potential for increased performance. For a heavy vehicle a decrease of 45 % in the residual error of fused grade estimates is observed when adding these corrections. Candidates for a method that integrates this new knowledge of model errors into a grade estimation method are proposed. Obtained knowledge of the dynamic vehicle behavior may also be valuable in applications using the generated grade data...|$|R

In midbrain tectal map development, FGFs can induce an entire midbrain, but their protein distribution is unclear, nor is it known whether they may act instructively to produce graded gene expression. Using a receptor-alkaline phosphatase fusion probe, we find a long-range posterior > anterior FGF protein gradient spanning the midbrain. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) is required for this gradient. To test whether graded FGF concentrations can instruct graded gene expression, a quantitative tectal explant assay was developed. Engrailed- 2 and ephrin-As, normally in posterior > anterior tectal gradients, showed graded upregulation.

Referring {{to the natural}} <b>grade</b> <b>map</b> presented by the Ministry of Environment, the five factors which {{would be expected to}} affect the environmental change were examined with multiple regression analysis. The factors above mentioned were as follows : (1) population; (2) density of road; (3) altitude; (4) undulation; and (5) distance from railway station. These factors are classified into three groups. The first two factors are concerned with the social situation, the next two with the natural situation and the last one is related to the situation of various conveniences of traffic. The proportions of each variate to the natural grade were calculated with the stepwise method. Consequently, it was recognized that the density of road as well as the altitude had the marked effects on the natural grade. With introducing these two variates into the quantitative analysis, the value of 0. 76 was obtained as the multicorrelation coefficient.

"December 2012 "This study started over the concern that many schools in Missouri were receiving penalties from the state through the No Child Left Behind law. The law required adequate yearly progress on achieving proficiency for all students. If the school or district did not meet adequate yearly progress goals, they were place in what was called “school improvement. After researching what many authors wrote on the subject of common assessments, this researcher felt that maybe some type of common assessment could be attained that may help predict how a student would do on the MAP test. The rationale being {{that it would be better}} to know of a problem ahead of time when intervention strategies could be incorporated, rather than to wait and find out after the student performed poorly on the MAP test. To test this theory this writer chose the third <b>grade</b> <b>MAP</b> scores and compared them to STAR Test scores and grades in reading. Other factors examined were poverty and attendance. Since the third <b>grade</b> <b>MAP</b> test is basically a reading comprehension test, and since the STAR is a reading comprehension test, it was felt that there could be a strong relationship between the two. While collecting the data one thing surprised me. The STAR and MAP scores on individual students did not always match up. Sometimes a student would score high on the STAR but low on the MAP. The same was true with grades. In looking back I think it was a little naïve to think that one score would predict another score. The relationship may be there but to predict a MAP score is stretching it. MAP scores, STAR Test scores, reading grades, attendance, and poverty level were all put through Pearson's Correlation to check strength of relationships. The results showed that the MAP, STAR Test, and reading grades all showed a strong relationship to each other. Attendance and poverty showed no or a very weak relationship to the variables. The results showed that using any two of the strong variables can help educators take a close look at areas of concern. No score on one variable will “predict” a score on another, but it can point educators to potential weaknesses. If a student has a low STAR Test score and a low reading grade it could indicate that the student might perform poorly on the <b>MAP.</b> If student <b>grades</b> are high but MAP scores and STAR Test scores are low, it could indicate a problem with the reading program or possible teacher performance...|$|R
