40|$|This paper takes sample tax {{regimes and}} tendencies from the {{developed}} countries in the EU- 15 and the USA, and uses them to analyse the influence of taxation on the choice of organizational form of profit-oriented entities in Serbia. In order {{to understand how the}} procedure of taxation affects the sphere of business decision-making it is necessary to focus on the tax status of business losses and valorization and the effects of the double taxation of dividends. The rule of successive deduction of losses ensures the <b>fiscally</b> <b>transparent</b> <b>entity</b> receives a tax saving {{in the form of a}} reduction of the present value of the total paid tax. Meanwhile the corporation is handicapped because it postpones loss deductions, that is, it postpones tax saving, which directly influences the level of the present value of saved tax. The global trend of gradually moving from the classical system towards shareholder relief provision, above all in the form of a reduced withholding tax rate on dividends, has two opposing features: it simplifies the tax procedure while neglecting the distributional aims (consequences) of taxation. The analysis of a particular practical example from the Serbian tax context enables us to draw a conclusion in relation to the relative taxes paid by entrepreneurs versus enterprises. The developed countries favour fiscally transparent entities, whereas Serbia allocates tax privileges to enterprises...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the early}} stages of the Hawke government, Australias {{taxation}} system has been modified with a view to attracting additional capital into the domestic venture capital market. In December 2002, the Howard government enacted the Taxation Laws Amendment (Venture Capital) Act 2002 (Cth) and the Venture Capital Act 2002 (Cth). This legislative package created a prospective concession primarily aimed at qualifying limited partnerships who participate in the Australian venture capital market. Subject to a rather stringent qualification criteria, such partnerships are treated as <b>fiscally</b> <b>transparent</b> for the purposes of Australian taxation law. In addition, the gains made upon the disposal of portfolio investments by these partnerships may not be subject to Australian capital gains tax ("CGT") or otherwise assessable as ordinary income. The central concept of these measures is the venture capital limited partnership ("VCLP"), and other fund of fund organisational forms which are founded on the limited partnership. For this reason, the provisions of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Venture Capital) Act 2002 (Cth) and the Venture Capital Act 2002 (Cth) are collectively identified as the "VCLP Concessions". This thesis has been prepared as a rigorous assessment of the VCLP Concessions. It draws upon an analysis of the nature and structure of venture capital investing to determine whether the particular features of the VCLP Concessions appropriately cater for the needs of prospective foreign investors. The efficacy and appropriateness of the VCLP Concessions from a policy perspective is also examined. Recommendations are provided which, if enacted, would address regions of structural inconsistency and improve the functioning of this concessional regime...|$|R

It is conjectured that the result of this traffic classification can be used at different network control levels. A neural network is a suitable engine of this tool. In high speed data communications networks, such as the proposed Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks, there are two conflicting forces. On the one hand, there is the network user, who wishes to view the network as a <b>transparent</b> <b>entity,</b> a pipe through which his data flows. On the other hand is the network provider, who wishes to maximize efficiency by connecting as many users to the network as possible. The trade-off between these two goals is the Quality of Service (QOS) that the user requires.

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} of {{a theoretical}} taxation background of German and Dutch holding companies {{with respect to}} the Czech Republic. It analyzes different incomes generated by the holding companies and focuses on comparison of possible tax scenarios. The scope of the work extends beyond mere description and analysis of relevant taxation - it attempts to add value by comparing advantages and disadvantages of the aforesaid countries for establishing a holding company. The work has always its firm foundations in the Czech legislation and continues to scrutinize a network of international double taxation treaties and a system of European directives. The core lies in analysis of different holding structures and in analysis of different income taxation, in particular income from dividends, capital gains, interests and royalties.

While in one country, a hybrid entity is taxed as a corporation, it is dealt as a <b>transparent</b> <b>entity</b> in which equity holders are subjected to taxation in another country. The difference in taxation of hybrid entities {{can be used to}} international tax arbitrage. In the U. S., many regulations on tax planning using hybrid entities have been implemented, such as (i) Creating dual consolidated loss, (ii) Avoiding Subpart F rule application, (iii) Tax deferral on transferring intangible properties, (iv) Abusing foreign tax credit mechanism, (v) Obtaining benefit of tax treaty, (vi) Avoiding capital gain taxation, however, these regulations do not necessarily have enough effectiveness to prevent tax avoidance. As the U. S. experience in this area can be very instructive for Japan, this article goes over the U. S. regulations considering implications for the tax treatment on various entities in Japan. In order to tackle international tax arbitrage surrounding taxation of hybrid entities, foremost importance is each country's own effort. Likewise, developing international common understanding on this issue through effective tax treaties or thorough discussions is thought to be effective. Amid ongoing globalization of economy where more diversified business entities come into existence, fair and predictable taxation based on through investigation are highly required...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} establish whether {{the presence or}} activities of a partner or partners in South Africa creates (or is at risk of creating) a permanent establishment for that partner, the partnership or the co-partners in South Africa. At the outset, the major legal and fiscal consequences of a partnership under South African law are investigated. The unique legal and fiscal treatment of a partnership as a mere aggregate of persons that is treated as <b>fiscally</b> <b>transparent</b> under South African law is relevant to determine the potential application of double taxation agreements to partnerships or their partners. Once {{the terms of a}} double taxation agreement are found to apply in the circumstances, the creation of a permanent establishment in terms thereof becomes relevant. The different types of partnerships and partners under South African partnership law are set out and their differentiating characteristics analysed in an effort to identify whether the activities or presence of certain partners are more at risk of giving rise to a permanent establishment than others. In a commercial context, the important distinction is drawn between ordinary and extraordinary partners as very different commercial consequences attach to these partners. In particular, whereas ordinary partners automatically derive an implied authority or mutual mandate to manage the business of the partnership as agents of their co-partners by virtue of the partnership agreement, extraordinary partners are excluded from the mutual mandate. The implied authority amongst partners becomes particularly relevant when considering one of the alternative tests for creating a permanent establishment that appear in the prevalent model tax conventions commonly used in the South African context, in terms of which the existence of authority is one of the required elements {{for the creation of a}} permanent establishment. The special rules surrounding the source of partnership income is investigated as a means of establishing jurisdiction to tax under South African domestic source rules. The impact of legislation on the South African source rules pertaining to partnerships as developed under the common law is critically analysed and the relevance of source rules in the permanent establishment context is evaluated. It is submitted that it is premature to consider the rules surrounding the creation of a permanent establishment under the terms of a double taxation agreement before it is established that the relevant contracting state has the requisite jurisdiction to tax and furthermore that the terms of that double taxation agreement apply to the matter at hand. Finally, the relevant articles of the model tax conventions commonly used in the South African context are discussed with specific focus on the unique attributes of a partnership that may impact on the creation of a permanent establishment for the partner or partners by virtue of the presence or activities of a partner or the partners in South Africa. The risk of creating a permanent establishment by virtue of the presence or activities of an ordinary partner in South Africa is contrasted with that of an extraordinary partner. It is concluded that the activities or presence of ordinary partners (as opposed to extraordinary partners) are particularly at risk of creating a permanent establishment in South Africa, although it is acknowledged that certain requirements will have to be met on the facts of each case before a permanent establishment will be found to exist...|$|R

AbstractOpen source intelligence (OSINT) is increasingly used for security and safety purposes. Even though security - and intelligence agencies and the police are using messages on social networking sites, weblogs, blogs or apps, state accountability mechanisms {{found it difficult to}} adapt to the online culture. Consider for instance the dilemma that open source information (OSINF) is frequently collected, processed, minded and stored by private companies. From a human right perspective, this gathering of OSINT demands proper checks and balances. Even though laws, regulations and policies may recognise this, it is important to review whether the gathering of OSINF online leads to new dilemmas. We conclude that state accountability should at least entail that the actual process and outcome of data collection, processing, mining and sharing is subjected to review and/or sanctions. Furthermore, it should become <b>transparent</b> which <b>entity</b> or who carries responsibility for the use of OSINT...|$|R
