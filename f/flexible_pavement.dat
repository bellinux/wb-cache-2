No significant performance differences were seen when a stiff silty-sand subgrade was used.

40|$|Pt. 1 : Sensitivity {{analysis}} Pt. 2 : Validations {{and local}} calibrationOptimization of transportation facilities for capacity and pavement condition {{could be achieved}} with mechanistic analysis of pavement structures. This report is focused on using the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) M-E Design Guide (MEPDG) to show the results of quantitative sensitivity analyses of typical pavement structures (rigid and <b>flexible</b> <b>pavements)</b> to highlight the main factors that affect pavement performance in terms of critical distresses and smoothness. The sensitivity analyses were conducted using the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide software (version 8. 1). Pavement performance included specifically faulting, transverse cracking, and smoothness for rigid pavements. It also included smoothness, longitudinal cracking, alligator cracking, transverse cracking, and permanent deformation for <b>flexible</b> <b>pavements.</b> The input parameters that were varied included traffic variables [Average Annual Daily Truck Traffic (AADTT), speed, and wander] and pavement structure for selected rigid and <b>flexible</b> <b>pavements.</b> In addition, the binder grade was varied for the <b>flexible</b> <b>pavements.</b> Based on the sensitivity results, the input parameters were ranked and categorized from those to which pavement performance is most sensitive to least sensitive (or insensitive). The ranking should help pavement designers identify the level of importance for each input parameter and also identify the input parameters that can be modified to satisfy the predetermined pavement performance criteria. It is expected that ranking could also help planners to determine how traffic of heavy vehicles {{could be directed to}} enhance the service life of various sections of pavement network and to develop better maintenance strategies. This project identified two important calibration factors for a Midwest implementation of the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (M-E PDG). The calibration factors are for the fatigue damage model in <b>flexible</b> <b>pavements</b> in Wisconsin. Pavement performance data was collected from Michigan, Ohio, Iowa and Wisconsin state transportation agencies using uniform data structures as spreadsheet templates specifically designed to manage the calibration data. Spreadsheets were developed for both <b>flexible</b> and rigid <b>pavements.</b> Calibration factors were derived by minimizing differences between observed and predicted pavement performance. The gathering of data required for calibration is labor intensive because the data resides in various and incongruent data sets. Furthermore, some pavement performance observations include temporary effects of maintenance and those observations must be removed through a tedious data cleaning process. The scope of calibration factors are limited by these data impediments. For each state, the observed and predicted performances are compared for both <b>flexible</b> and rigid <b>pavements.</b> The predicted performance is computed using default and derived calibration factors.

40|$|The AASHTO 1993 Guide for Design of Pavement Structures is {{the most}} widely used {{pavement}} design method in both Canada and the United States, and is currently used by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) for both <b>flexible</b> and rigid <b>pavement</b> design. Despite its widespread use, the AASHTO 1993 pavement design method has significant limitations stemming primarily from the limited range of conditions observed at the AASHTO Road Test from which its empirical relationships were derived. The Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) was developed to address the perceived limitations of the AASHTO 1993 Guide. Although the MEPDG provides a rational pavement design procedure with a solid foundation in engineering mechanics, a considerable amount of work is required to adapt and validate the MEPDG to Ontario conditions. The purpose of this research was to conduct a comparative analysis of Ontario structural pavement designs using the AASHTO 1993 Guide for Design of Pavement Structures and the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide. Historical flexible, rigid, and asphalt overlay pavement designs completed using the AASHTO 1993 pavement design method for the MTO were evaluated using a two-stage procedure. First, the nationally-calibrated MEPDG pavement distress models were used to predict the performance of the pavements designed using the AASHTO 1993 method. The purpose of this stage of the analysis was to determine whether the two methods predicted pavement performance in a consistent manner across a range of design conditions typical of Ontario. Finally, the AASHTO 1993 and MEPDG methods were compared based on the thickness of the asphalt concrete or Portland cement concrete layers required to satisfy their respective design criteria. The results of the comparative analysis demonstrate that the AASHTO 1993 method generally over-predicted pavement performance relative to the MEPDG for new <b>flexible</b> <b>pavements</b> and asphalt overlays of <b>flexible</b> <b>pavements.</b> The MEPDG predicted that most of the new <b>flexible</b> <b>pavements</b> and asphalt overlays of <b>flexible</b> <b>pavements</b> designed using the AASHTO 1993 method would fail primarily due to permanent deformation and / or roughness. The asphalt layer thicknesses obtained using the MEPDG exceeded the asphalt layer thicknesses obtained using the AASHTO 1993 method, and a poor correlation was observed between the asphalt layer thicknesses obtained using the two methods. Many of the new <b>flexible</b> <b>pavements</b> and asphalt overlays of existing <b>flexible</b> <b>pavements</b> could not be re-designed to meet the MEPDG performance criteria by increasing the asphalt layer thickness. The results of the comparative analysis showed that the AASHTO 1993 method generally under-predicted rigid pavement performance relative to the MEPDG, although the results varied widely between alternative rigid pavement designs. The AASHTO 1993 rigid pavement designs that the MEPDG predicted would not meet the rigid pavement performance criteria generally failed due to pavement roughness. A very poor correlation was observed between the Portland cement concrete layer thicknesses obtained using the MEPDG and AASHTO 1993 design methods. The MEPDG predicted thinner Portland cement concrete layer thicknesses than the AASHTO 1993 design method for most of the rigid pavement designs...|$|R

If investments in the road pavement are not carried out properly, there usually are more and more road pavements the condition of which causes delays in transportation, and directly compromises traffic safety.
