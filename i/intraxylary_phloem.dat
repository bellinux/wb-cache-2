25|$|In some eudicot {{families}} (Apocynaceae, Convolvulaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Solanaceae, Myrtaceae, Asteraceae, Thymelaeaceae), phloem also develops on {{the inner}} side of the vascular cambium; in this case, a distinction between external phloem and internal phloem or <b>intraxylary</b> <b>phloem</b> is made. Internal phloem is mostly primary, and begins differentiation later than the external phloem and protoxylem, though it is not without exceptions. In some other families (Amaranthaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Salvadoraceae), the cambium also periodically forms inward strands or layers of phloem, embedded in the xylem: Such phloem strands are called included phloem or interxylary phloem.|$|E
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} features {{of wood and}} stem anatomy are presented for 44 collections of 16 genera and 35 species ofConvolvulaceae. Markedly furrowed xylem characterizes the genera of tribe Cresseae. Successive cambia occur in 11 of the genera studied. Large patches of axial parenchyma occur in many of these; only in one species was interxylary phloem (formed internally by the cambium) observed in the parenchyma patches. <b>Intraxylary</b> <b>phloem</b> at {{the periphery of the}} pith is universal in Convolvulaceae, but newly reported is the fact that in many species, cambial activity adds secondary phloem to the <b>intraxylary</b> <b>phloem</b> strands. These cambia were also observed to add limited amounts of secondary xylem externally in Ericybe and Operculina. Fragmentation of the vascular cylinder by growth from the inner cambia leads to initiation of radially oriented cambia (ray cambia) along the ray zone where fracture occurs. Three new types of vessel restriction patterns (nonrandom distribution of vessels in wood or absence of vessels within some parts of the secondary xylem) are reported for the family (and dicotyledons). Rays are predominantly uniseriate; ray histology and quantitative vessel features show little change ontogenetically in species with successive cambia, suggesting that this cambial mode deters the kinds of progressive changes that occur in dicotyledons with a single cambium. Vessels are much wider in lianoid Convolvulaceae than in shrubby species; the lianoid species of Ipomoea have vessels twice the diameter of those in arborescent species of Ipomoea. Conjunctive parenchyma may serve for water storage in I. arborescens and other species, but this tissue and abundance of axial parenchyma in lianas might also aid flexibility and damage resistance. Septate fiber-tracheids and septate libriform fibers occur in a few species and represent tracheid dimorphism. Occurrence of tracheids together with fibriform vessel elements in woods of many Convolvulaceae suggests relationship of Convolvulaceae to Polemoniaceae and Hydrophyllaceae; <b>intraxylary</b> <b>phloem</b> and other wood features suggest relationship between Convolvulaceae and Solanaceae...|$|E
40|$|Background: Gentiana olivieri Griseb. (Afat) (Gentianaceae), {{which has}} many {{bioactive}} compounds {{is used as}} antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, digestive aid, antidepressant, and antianemic in traditional medicine. Materials and Methods: Root, stem, and leaf sections of G. olivieri were taken free hand or by sliding microtome and examined on light microscope.

40|$|To {{understand}} evolutionary {{patterns and}} processes {{that account for}} anatomical diversity in relation to ecology and life form diversity, anatomy of storage roots and stems of the genus Adenia (Passifloraceae) were analyzed using an explicit phylogenetic context. Over 65, 000 measurements are reported for 47 quantitative and qualitative traits from 58 species in the genus. Vestiges of lianous ancestry were apparent throughout the group, as treelets and lianous taxa alike share relatively short, often wide, vessel elements with simple, transverse perforation plates, and alternate lateral wall pitting; fibriform vessel elements, tracheids associated with vessels, and libriform fibers as additional tracheary elements; and well-developed axial parenchyma. Multiple cambial variants were observed, including anomalous parenchyma proliferation, anomalous vascular strands, successive cambia, and a novel type of <b>intraxylary</b> <b>phloem.</b> Successive cambia, trichomes, dermal features, and <b>intraxylary</b> <b>phloem</b> were synapomorphic for particular clades, whereas most traits were homoplastic. Several anatomical features of Adenia are consistent with xeromorphy. Repeated loss and gain of cuticularized, photosynthetic mature stems, narrow vessel elements, highly aggregated vessels, and other features indicative of xeromorphy reveal labile evolution of ecologically significant anatomical features, whereas features that are characteristic of the liana life form reveal evolutionary conservation despite diversification of life form within Adenia...|$|E
40|$|Morpho-anatomical {{features}} in leaves, stems and unripe fruits of Solanum pseudocapsicum L., Solanaceae, were investigated by histological methods. Anatomically the plant may be characterised {{by the presence}} of uniseriate trichomes, anomocytic stomata, calcium oxalate needles in leaves while presence of oval to circular compound starch grains, angular vessels, vertically upright, uni-biseriate rays and <b>intraxylary</b> <b>phloem</b> with differentiation of internal cambium abutting marginal pith cells and protoxylem in transverse view. Development of distinct internal cambium may be considered as a characteristic feature for S. pseudocapsicum. Intraxylary secondary phloem was composed of sieve tube elements, companion cells and axial parenchyma cells...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the formation of successive rings of cambia in Rivea hypocriteriformis Choisy (Convolvulaceae). The mature stem is composed of four to five rings of xylem alternating with phloem. Successive cambia originate as smaller and larger segments; union and anastomosing of small cambial segments often leads {{to the formation of}} discontinuous rings. In the initial stage of growth, several vascular bundles interconnect to form the first ring of vascular cambium. The cambium remains functional for one complete season and becomes dormant during summer; a new ring of cambium is completed prior to the subsequent monsoon season and sprouting of new leaves. Successive cambia are initiated from the pericyclic parenchyma situated three to four cell layers outside of the protophloem. Functionally, all the successive cambia are bidirectional and produce secondary xylem centripetally and phloem centrifugally. The secondary xylem is diffuse-porous, with indistinct growth rings and consisting of wide fibriform vessels, fibre tracheids, and axial and ray parenchyma cells. The xylem rays are uni- to multiseriate and heterocellular. The multiseriate rays contain lignified marginal ray cells and thin-walled, unlignified central cells. The central ray cells also show accumulations of starch and druses. Discrete strands of <b>intraxylary</b> <b>phloem</b> occur at the periphery of the pith, and additional <b>intraxylary</b> <b>phloem</b> develops from adjacent cells as secondary growth progresses. Earlier-formed phloem shows heavy accumulation of callose, followed by its compaction. The development of successive cambia is correlated with extension growth and with the phenology of the plant...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the leaf anatomy ofthree species of three genera of Goetzeaceae (Henoonia, Goetzea, and Espadaea) revealed a number of characteristics common to all genera, viz. anomocytic stomata, sinuous anticlinal epidermal walls, both glandular and uniseriate nonglandular trichomes, crystal sand and druses in the mesophyll (often in the same cell), and <b>intraxylary</b> <b>phloem.</b> The mid veins of these species exhibit secondary growth and parenchymatous rays. The unifying anatomical features of this family are, however, not uncommon in the Solanaceae. The {{results of this study}} support placement of the Goetzeaceae in or very near Solanaceae. The ecology of the species studied is reflected in the anatomy of the leaves. The leaves of Henoonia exhibit a number ofxeromorphic features; the leaves of Goetzea are mesomorphic; while those of Espadaea are intermediate...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an anatomical study concerning the leaf structure (petiole and blade) of a well-known Ficus species with ornamental value Ficus lyrata Warb. The petiole outer most layers of cells are suberized, {{followed by a}} differentiated cortex and a fascicular vascular system, represented by phloem and xylem elements. The bifacial and hipostomatic blade upper epidermis {{is followed by a}} two-layered hypodermis with lithocysts and cystoliths. The mesophyll is heterogeneous. The lower epidermis continuity is interrupted by anomocytic stomata. The mid rib possesses two arcs of conductive tissues vascular system. Remarkable is the presence of the apparently medullary leptocentric bundles and several groups of <b>intraxylary</b> <b>phloem.</b> Laticifers and oxalate crystals are present in the petiole and around the mid rib structure. The thick cuticle, the lignification elements, a multiple epidermis are probably anatomical features of the plant adaptation to xerophytic environments...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} anatomical {{study was}} made of the genus Passerina comprising 20 species and four subspecies, most of which are endemic to southern Africa. It showed that anatomical variation is useful in species recognition and classification. Anatomical characters typical of Thymelaeaceae and displayed in Passerina include isobilateral leaves, a papillate cuticular membrane, mucilaginous epidermal cell walls, a parenchymatous bundle sheath and extraxylary sclerenchyma fibres. Vascular bundles of the leaf lack <b>intraxylary</b> <b>phloem.</b> Characters common to  Passerina are inverse-dorsiventral and epis- tomatic leaves, inverted palisade parenchyma and an abaxial hvpodermal sclerenchymatous sheath. Orientation of the main vascular bundle in relation to the epidermis and mesophyll allows the recognition of four leaf structural types and ten states, according to which all species can be characterized and grouped. Functionally many anatomical features of the leaf in Passerina are interpreted as adaptations to the Mediterranean climate of the Cape Floristic Region, where most species occur. </p...|$|E
40|$|Leptadenia reticulata, an {{important}} medicinal plant of India, {{was subjected to}} a detailed pharmacognostical analysis to locate distinguishing biomarkers. Multicellular uniseriate smooth trichomes, bi-collateral vascular bundles, anisocytic stomata and absence of any cell inclusions were the features seen in leaf. Stem possessed broad patches of sclereids in the pericycle and irregular patches of <b>intraxylary</b> <b>phloem</b> and internal phloem consisted of radial rows of angular cells with starch grains. Secondary xylem consisting of large vessels and tracheids and prismatic crystals of calcium oxalate in cortex are very distinct. Large sclereids, starch grains and prismatic calcium oxalate crystals in cortex, bast and parenchyma differentiate roots. X-shaped pits and multiseriate medullary rays were seen in stem whereas roots possessed simple pits and mostly uniseriate medullary rays. Other micromorphological characters were stomatal index 11. 67 ± 0. 68, palisade ratio 6. 0 ± 0. 39, vein islet number 9. 5 ± 0. 97, and vein termination number 11 – 12...|$|E
30|$|Cambial {{variants}} in Piperaceae include successive cambia, xylem in plates, xylem dispersed by parenchyma divisions, <b>intraxylary</b> <b>phloem,</b> {{included phloem}} (interxylary phloem), phloem arcs/wedges, and secondary growth of external primary vascular bundles (Metcalfe and Chalk 1985; Caballé 1993; Carlquist 1991, 2001, 2013; Isnard et al. 2003; Acevedo-Rodríguez 2005; Jacques and de Franceschi 2007; Angyalossy et al. 2012). In woody vines, certain {{segments of the}} interfascicular cambium produce secondary parenchyma whereas a fascicular cambium produces typical proportions of xylem and phloem, as in Aristolochia (Aristolochiaceae) (Beck 2011). The xylem is furrowed by arcs or wedges of phloem derived from portions of the cambium that produce less xylem and more phloem (Angyalossy et al. 2015). However, furrowed xylem may develop from phloem wedges or secondary parenchyma proliferation. Carlquist (1991) defined rays as having very wide, thin-walled cells with limited subdivision during secondary growth. Wide rays develop in Piperaceae, and during secondary growth, the rays do not subdivide very much. Indeed, there may be little difference between them. Wider rays in lianas allow the stems to experience torsion without sustaining damage to vessels and contribute to liana stem flexibility (Putz and Holbrook 1991). The functional significance of wider rays in these seven Piper species needs to be checked.|$|E
40|$|Pepper plants (Capsicum annuum L. cv., Hungarian Wax) {{were grown}} under metal halide (MH) lamps or {{light-emitting}} diode (LED) arrays with different spectra {{to determine the}} effects of light quality on plant anatomy of leaves and stems. One LED (660) array supplied 90 % red light at 660 nm (25 nm band-width at half-peak height) and 1 % far-red light between 700 - 800 nm. A second LED (660 / 735) array supplied 83 % red light at 660 nm and 17 % far-red light at 735 nm (25 nm band-width at half-peak height). A third LED (660 /blue) array supplied 98 % red light at 660 nm, 1 % blue light between 350 - 550 nm, and 1 % far-red light between 700 - 800 nm. Control plants were grown under broad spectrum metal halide lamps. Plants were gron at a mean photon flux (300 - 800 nm) of 330 micromol m- 2 s- 1 under a 12 h day-night photoperiod. Significant anatomical changes in stem and leaf morphologies were observed in plants grown under the LED arrays compared to plants grown under the broad-spectrum MH lamp. Cross-sectional areas of pepper stems, thickness of secondary xylem, numbers of <b>intraxylary</b> <b>phloem</b> bundles in the periphery of stem pith tissues, leaf thickness, numbers of choloplasts per palisade mesophyll cell, and thickness of palisade and spongy mesophyll tissues were greatest in peppers grown under MH lamps, intermediate in plants grown under the 660 /blue LED array, and lowest in peppers grown under the 660 or 660 / 735 LED arrays. Most anatomical features of pepper stems and leaves were similar among plants grown under 660 or 660 / 735 LED arrays. The effects of spectral quality on anatomical changes in stem and leaf tissues of peppers generally correlate to the amount of blue light present in the primary light source...|$|E
40|$|This {{publication}} comprises {{two main}} parts. Part one (Chapter I) {{deals with the}} leaf anatomy of Apocynaceae in East Africa, where this family is represented by 77 species in 30 genera. Out of these, 37 species in 26 genera are examined and these exhibit {{a wide range of}} anatomical variations. Many species can be separated {{on the basis of their}} leaf anatomy and many genera are confirmed to be closely related. The most outstanding anatomical characters include the dorsiventral leaves, presence of laticifers, and bicollateral vascular bundles with <b>intraxylary</b> <b>phloem.</b> Part two (Chapter 2) is a monograph of the apocynaceous subtribe Pleiocarpinae- Plumeriodeae-Carisseae, which comprises of three genera, Hunteria (12 spp.); Pleiocarpa (5 spp.) and Picralima (1 sp.). The subtribe Pleiocarpinae is restricted to Africa, although one species, Hunteria zeylanica, extends to Asia. It is easily distinguished from the other members of the tribe Carisseae by the presence of completely apocarpous ovaries, with 2 - 5 carpels, which are a great exception in the family Apocynaceae. The genus Picralima was first described by Pierre in 1896 and has since remained monotypic. Its only species, Picralima nitida, is not only exploited for its wood, but also used medicinally in its present distribution area and employed as well as an arrow and a fish poison. In this publication, three new species are described in the genus Hunteria (Roxburgh, 1814, 1824) and one new combination is made. The genus Pleiocarpa (Bentham, 1876) has proved to be a very difficult subject due to insufficient collections and lack of sufficient information from the field. At present it has 5 species and one doubtful species of which the collections are all either sterile or only bearing fruits. One new species is described. Parallel to the investigations reported here a taxonomic treatment was prepared for the Flora of Tropical East Africa. This contribution, covering all the mentioned 30 genera and 77 species, will be submitted to the editors in Kew shortly...|$|E
