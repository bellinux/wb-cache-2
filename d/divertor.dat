5000|$|The <b>divertor</b> was {{initially}} introduced during the earliest studies of fusion power {{systems in the}} 1950s.

These impurities {{were responsible for the}} loss of heat, and caused other effects that made it more difficult to keep the reaction going. The <b>divertor</b> was proposed as a solution to this problem. Operating on the same principle as a mass spectrometer, the plasma passes through the <b>divertor</b> region where heavier ions are flung out of the fuel mass by centrifugal force, colliding with some sort of absorber material, and depositing its energy as heat. Initially considered to be a device required for operational reactors, few early designs included a <b>divertor.</b>|$|E
