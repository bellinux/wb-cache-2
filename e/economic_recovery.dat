His positions spanned the social spectrum, ranging from his conservative {{opposition to abortion}} to his more libertarian stances advocating immigration reform.

As {{the third year of}} recovery drew to a close in 1985, payroll employment had grown by 10 million {{since the end of the}} recession. Growth continued through July 1990, creating what was at the time the longest peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history.|$|R

Taking over an almost bankrupt administration, he ended the costly wars with France and Scotland and tackled finances in ways that led to some <b>economic</b> <b>recovery.</b> To prevent further uprisings he introduced countrywide policing on a local basis, appointing Lords Lieutenants who were {{in close contact with}} the central authority. Dudley's religious policy was—in accordance with Edward's proclivities—decidedly Protestant, further enforcing the English Reformation and promoting radical reformers to high Church positions.|$|E

5000|$|France, like {{a number}} of countries, was {{affected}} by the 2008 financial crisis. However, during {{the worst part of}} the crisis, between 2008-2010, France fared better than other industrialized countries. For example, the Euro zone’s overall GDP decreased by 4 percent, while France’s GDP only decreased by 2.2 percent. This resilience is linked to France’s social protection system, which, through the transfers it organizes (47 percent of gross disposable household income in 2007) equips France with strong economic stabilizers. However, these stabilizers weigh inversely on recovery. Starting in 2012, many countries experienced <b>economic</b> <b>recoveries,</b> where the analysis of the indicators of economic activity in France do not show a clear recovery, or rather do not show an increased growth during this time.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the contributions of}} monetary and fiscal policy to postwar <b>economic</b> <b>recoveries.</b> We find that the Federal Reserve typically responds to downturns with prompt and large reductions in interest rates. Discretionary fiscal policy, in contrast, rarely reacts before the trough in economic activity, and even then the responses are usually small. Simulations using multipliers from both simple regressions and a large macroeconomic model show that the interest rate falls account for {{nearly all of the}} above-average growth that occurs early in recoveries. Our estimates also indicate that on several occasions expansionary policies have contributed substantially to above-normal growth outside of recoveries. Finally, the results suggest that the persistence of aggregate output movements is largely the result of the extreme persistence of the contribution of policy changes. ...|$|R
