50|$|A floor sink {{is a type}} of <b>floor</b> <b>drain</b> {{primarily}} used as {{an indirect}} waste receptor. It is generally deeper than a standard <b>floor</b> <b>drain</b> and can have a full or partial grate, or no grate as required to accommodate the indirect waste pipes. It usually has a dome strainer in the bottom to prevent splash-back. The body material can be epoxy coated or enameled cast iron, stainless steel, or PVC. Floor sinks are found in commercial kitchens and some hospital applications.|$|R

5000|$|A {{floor drain}} is a {{plumbing}} fixture that is {{installed in the}} floor of a structure, mainly designed to remove any standing water near it. They are usually round, but can also be square or rectangular. They usually range from 2 to 12 in; most are 4 in in diameter. They have gratings that are made of metal or plastic. The floor around the drain is also sloped to allow the water to flow to the drain. Many residential basements have one or more <b>floor</b> <b>drains,</b> usually near a water heater or washer/dryer. <b>Floor</b> <b>drains</b> can also be found in commercial basements, restrooms, kitchens, refrigerator areas, locker/shower rooms, laundry facilities, and near swimming pools, among other places.|$|E
50|$|Basement <b>floor</b> <b>drains</b> {{that connect}} to {{sanitary}} sewers {{need to be}} filled regularly to prevent the trap from drying out and sewer gas from escaping into the basement. The drain trap can be topped up automatically by the condensation from air conditioners or high-efficiency furnaces. A small tube from another downpipe is sometimes used to keep the trap from drying out. Health Canada advocates the use of special radon gas traps for <b>floor</b> <b>drains</b> that lead to soil or to a sealed sump pump. In areas where storm and sanitary sewers are combined, {{and there is the}} risk of flooding and sewage backing up, backwater valves in all basement drains may be mandated by code and definitely are recommended even if not mandated.|$|E

50|$|Thorough {{mechanical}} cleaning of drains will remove the larval food source, {{and is the}} most effective control measure. Alternatively, injected foams containing bacteria or enzymes may be useful to break down gelatinous scum deposits. Besides sink drains, <b>floor</b> <b>drains</b> and shower drains are common sources, as well as leaky shower pans, but any location with moist decaying organic matter can be a breeding site. In commercial buildings, sump pump pits, sewers, and elevator pits may trap moisture where drain flies can breed.|$|E
50|$|A trap primer (or {{trap seal}} primer) is a {{plumbing}} device or valve that adds water to traps. The water seals in traps {{are needed to}} prevent sewer gases from entering buildings, but because this water is exposed to the air, it is subject to evaporation over time in infrequently used <b>floor</b> <b>drains,</b> leading {{to the release of}} sewer gas into the environment. The trap primer mitigates this problem by injecting water, either directly or indirectly, into the trap to maintain the water seal indefinitely.|$|E
50|$|Building codes {{may require}} trap primers for traps in certain {{locations}} or situations, usually {{those in which}} industry experience has shown that {{they are likely to}} dry out. The most common requirement is for basement <b>floor</b> <b>drains,</b> which are only used when the basement floods. Sometimes they are also installed in locations where the plumbing code does not require a primer because of a high probability of the trap drying out, but because of a nearby ignition source and the explosion hazard in the event that the trap did leak sewer gas. Most designs require installation in an accessible location where periodic maintenance can be performed.|$|E

50|$|From {{this period}} {{increased}} {{knowledge and understanding}} of hydrodynamics and aerodynamics, coupled to the availability of plywood and reliable waterproof glues saw dramatic changes. Clinker and carvel construction was dropped and glued up hollow pear shaped masts became standard. By the late 1960s a greater understanding of the science behind planning saw hulls made with increasingly less rocker, very fine forward with very flat aft sections. Once trapezes were introduced the number of crew dropped to 4 by the early 70s and then to 3. Designs became wider, especially aft. As speeds increased so did capsizes, so an effort was made to install built in buoyancy and some self draining capabilities with transom flaps, venturi <b>floor</b> <b>drains</b> built in tanks, especially forward and false floors.|$|E
50|$|In 1975, PCBs were {{discovered}} in Waukegan Harbor sediments. Investigation revealed that during manufacturing activities at Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC), hydraulic fluids containing PCBs had been discharged through <b>floor</b> <b>drains</b> at the OMC plant, directly to Waukegan Harbor and into ditches discharging into Lake Michigan. The OMC plants were subsequently added to the National Priorities List, and was designated as one of 43 Great Lakes Areas of Concern. Cleanup of the site began in 1990, with OMC providing $20-25 million in funding. During the OMC cleanup, additional soil contaminants were found {{at the location of}} the former Waukegan Manufactured Gas and Coke company. Soil removal was completed at the Coke site in 2005, and cleanup of that soil will continue for several years.|$|E

50|$|Sanitation {{drainage}} {{was through}} a closed system {{leading to a}} sewer apart from the hill. The queen's megaron contained {{an example of the}} first water-flushing system latrine adjoining the bathroom. This toilet was a seat over a drain that was flushed by pouring water from a jug. The bathtub located in the adjoining bathroom similarly had to be filled by someone heating, carrying, and pouring water, and must have been drained by overturning into a <b>floor</b> <b>drain</b> or by bailing.

50|$|Water heaters {{potentially}} can explode {{and cause}} significant damage, injury, or death if certain safety devices are not installed. A safety device called a temperature and pressure relief (T&P or TPR) valve, is normally fitted {{on the top}} of the water heater to dump water if the temperature or pressure becomes too high. Most plumbing codes require that a discharge pipe be connected to the valve to direct the flow of discharged hot water to a drain, typically a nearby <b>floor</b> <b>drain,</b> or outside the living space. Some building codes allow the discharge pipe to terminate in the garage.|$|R
