50|$|The {{inherent}} {{disadvantage of}} the radar beam riding {{system is that}} the beam spreads as it travels outward from the broadcaster. As the missile flies towards the target, it therefore becomes increasingly inaccurate. This {{is not a problem}} at short ranges, but as many early surface-to-air missiles were designed to work at long ranges, this was a major issue. For example, earlier versions of the RIM-2 Terrier missile introduced in the 1950s were beam riders, but later variants employed <b>semi-active</b> radar <b>homing</b> to improve their effectiveness against high-performance and low-flying targets. In contrast to beam riding, <b>semi-active</b> <b>guidance</b> becomes more accurate as the missile approaches the target.|$|R
50|$|The Standard {{can also}} be used against ships, either at {{line-of-sight}} range using its <b>semi-active</b> <b>homing</b> mode, or over the horizon using inertial guidance and terminal infrared homing.|$|R
50|$|Early air-to-air {{missiles}} used <b>semi-active</b> radar <b>guidance,</b> {{that is the}} missile used the radiation produced by the launching aircraft to guide it to the target. The latest generation of BVR missiles {{use a combination of}} semi-active and active radar.|$|R
50|$|Nimrod has a <b>semi-active</b> laser <b>guidance</b> system, {{capable of}} day and night operation. Its flight {{trajectory}} can be set below obscuring cloud layers, while a forward scouting team uses a laser designator to direct it from up to 26 km behind.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{medium and}} long range active radar <b>homing</b> and <b>semi-active</b> radar <b>homing</b> {{missiles}} can be fired at targets outside or beyond visual range. However, when a pilot is dogfighting at short-range, his position {{relative to the}} opponent is decidedly important. Outperformance of another pilot and that pilot's aircraft is critical to maintain the upper-hand. A common saying for dogfighting is [...] "lose sight, lose fight".|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a two mass oscillator, a translatoric {{moving mass}} {{connected}} to a rigid beam by a spring-damper system, is used to numerically investigate the capability of load path redistribution due to controlled <b>semi-active</b> <b>guidance</b> elements with friction brakes. The mathematical friction model will be derived by the LUGRE approach. The rigid beam is embedded on two supports and is initially aligned with evenly distributed loads in beam and supports by the same stiffness condition. With the <b>semi-active</b> auxiliary kinematic <b>guidance</b> elements {{it is possible to}} provide additional forces to relieve one of the beam’s supports. Two control strategies are designed and compared to induce additional forces in the auxiliary guidance elements to bypass portions of loading away from the spring-damper system towards the now kinetic auxiliary guidance elements. They depend on the different control inputs: I beam misalignment and II desired reaction force ratio in the supports. The beam’s misalignment and the supports’ reaction forces are calculated numerically for varying stiffness parameters of the supports and are compared with and without <b>semi-active</b> auxiliary kinematic <b>guidance</b> elements. The structure’s moving mass is loaded with a force according to a step-function. Thus, undesired misalignment caused by varying stiffness as well as undesired load distribution in the structure’s supports can be reduced by shifting load between the supports during operation...|$|R
50|$|The Petrel {{was never}} {{considered}} {{a very high}} priority by the U.S. Navy, which was far {{more concerned about the}} threat from submarines than surface ships. New submarine designs powered by nuclear reactors were beginning to appear in the mid-1950s, vessels which could remain submerged indefinitely. As a result the prospects of catching an enemy submarine on the surface were receding, and more emphasis was being placed on underwater engagements. The use of <b>semi-active</b> <b>guidance</b> also required the launching aircraft to continue closing the target throughout the missile's flight, exposing it to a far greater danger from enemy defenses. The AUM-N-2 was initially assigned only to reserve units. In 1959 the missiles were withdrawn from reserve service and converted to serve as air-launched target drones.|$|R
50|$|It {{differs from}} SARH (<b>semi-active</b> radar <b>homing)</b> and SALH (<b>semi-active</b> laser <b>homing)</b> {{in which the}} target is {{illuminated}} by a powerful emitter and a sensor in the head of missile detects the reflected emissions and directs it to the target.|$|R

50|$|The Krasnopol-M2, {{a further}} {{development}} based on Krasnopol-M, is a 155mm artillery projectile designed to engage armored targets. It uses a <b>semi-active</b> laser (SAL) <b>guidance</b> {{system in the}} terminal phase of its trajectory.|$|R
40|$|Load-bearing {{structures}} with kinematic functions enable and disable {{degrees of}} freedom and are part of many mechanical engineering applications. The relative movements between a wheel and {{the body of a}} car or a landing gear and an aircraft fuselage are examples for load-bearing systems with defined kinematics. In most cases, the load is transmitted through a predetermined load path of a host structure to the structural support interfaces. However, uncertainty due to unexpected load peaks or varying health condition, e. g. changes in stiffness or damping parameters over time of the structure’s components may require an adjustment of the load path for safety reasons. Load paths transmitted through damaged or weakened components can be the reason for reduced comfort or even failure. For example, reduced support stiffness can lead to uncertain and undesirable misalignment in the structure. In this paper, a two mass oscillator, a translatoric moving mass connected to a rigid beam by a spring-damper system, is used to numerically investigate the capability of load path adaption due to controlled <b>semi-active</b> <b>guidance</b> elements with friction brakes. The mathematical friction model will be derived by the LuGre approach. The rigid beam is embedded on two supports and is initially aligned with evenly distributed loads in beam and supports by the same stiffness condition. However, if uneven support stiffness occurs, e. g. by damage or fatigue, the beam becomes misaligned. One sided lowering of the beam may follow. Two auxiliary kinematic guidance elements are used to redirect the load path depending on the beam’s alignment condition. With the <b>semi-active</b> auxiliary kinematic <b>guidance</b> elements it is possible to provide additional forces to relieve one of the beam’s support if it changes its stiffness. The beams’s misalignment is calculated numerically for varying stiffness parameters of the supports and is compared with and without <b>semi-active</b> auxiliary kinematic <b>guidance</b> elements. The structure is loaded with a force according to a step-function and a simple signal-based feedback PID-controller is designed to induce additional forces in the auxiliary guidance elements to bypass portions of loading away from supports with decreasing stiffness. Thus, uncertainty due to unacceptable misalignment caused by varying stiffness conditions of the structure’s supports can be reduced by shifting load between the supports during operation...|$|R
50|$|The LAHAT is {{designed}} to achieve a 95 percent probability of kill under most conditions. It has a <b>semi-active</b> laser <b>guidance</b> system, capable of both direct and indirect laser designation—the target can be laser-designated by the launching platform (e.g. firing tank) or other platform (e.g. another tank, helicopter, UAV, or forward scouting team), requiring minimal exposure in the firing position. With a low launch signature, the missile’s trajectory can be set to match either top attack (armoured fighting vehicle, warship) or direct attack (helicopter gunship) engagements.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to these, the XM1111 (Mid-Range-Munition Chemical Energy) {{was also in}} development. The XM1111 was a guided munition using a dual-mode seeker that combined imaging-infrared and <b>semi-active</b> laser <b>guidance.</b> The MRM-CE was selected over the competing MRM-KE which used a rocket-assisted kinetic energy penetrator. The CE variant was chosen due to its better effects against secondary targets, providing a more versatile weapon. The Army hoped to achieve IOC with the XM1111 by 2013. However, the Mid-Range Munition was cancelled in 2009 along with Future Combat Systems.|$|R
50|$|Retransmission homing, {{also called}} Track Via Missile or TVM, is a hybrid between command <b>guidance,</b> <b>semi-active</b> radar <b>homing</b> and active radar homing. The missile picks up {{radiation}} broadcast by the tracking radar which bounces off {{the target and}} relays it to the tracking station, which relays commands back to the missile.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} to Surface-to-Air missiles (SAMs). Modern missiles are commonly <b>semi-active</b> <b>homing.</b> They need the firing unit to actively illuminate the target with a missile fire-control director throughout the flight. If a guiding director shuts down then the missiles still in flight will self-destruct. So {{the number of}} intercepts a unit can simultaneously prosecute {{is limited by the}} number of directors possessed. The use of directors exposes the firing unit to counterattack.|$|R

50|$|Thunderbird had {{performance}} {{similar to}} other semi-portable missiles like the US MIM-23 Hawk and fully mobile Soviet 2K11 Krug, although it pre-dates both of these systems and offered greater range over them, but have slower speed compared to the soviet 2K11 Krug. After its mid-life upgrades, which shared several components with the RAF's Bristol Bloodhound, Thunderbird featured a continuous-wave radar <b>semi-active</b> <b>homing</b> system that was highly resistant to Radar jamming and deception, {{and was able to}} track targets even at very low altitudes.|$|R
50|$|TVM {{guidance}} {{requires a}} radar ground station and a missile with a radar receiver. As with <b>semi-active</b> <b>homing</b> missiles, the ground-based radar illuminates the target with radar energy {{which is then}} reflected off the target and detected by the missile. However, unlike a SARH missile, the missile itself does not compute interception with this information. Instead, data from the radar returns is relayed {{back to the ground}} station via a data link which also serves for passing the guidance commands to the missile.|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s the Republic of Korea Navy {{decided to}} import Exocet anti-ship {{missiles}} to deter North Korean naval provocations. Considering {{the fact that}} the DPRK Navy was then and now mostly composed of numerous small to midsize ships, a cheap, small guided anti-ship missile was proposed. In 1978 the Korean Agency for Defense Development (ADD) started the development of the Hae Ryong anti-ship missile, and by 1987 the ROK Navy approved for the mass production of the missiles. But the Hae Ryong was fitted with a <b>semi-active</b> laser <b>guidance</b> system, limiting its tactical capability during bad weather. Additional pressure from the USA ultimately resulted in the termination of the project.|$|R
50|$|In July 2014, Thales {{unveiled}} {{a modification of}} the LMM that turns it into a glide bomb, called the FreeFall LMM (FFLMM). Thales partnered with Textron to market it as the Fury for the U.S. market, who provides a height-of-burst sensor and electronic safe and arm device. The weapon had been in development for 18 months and undergone initial test drops in August 2013. In comparison to the LMM, the FFLMM removes the rocket motor and associated components while keeping the body and control actuators, as well as adding INS and GPS navigation, <b>semi-active</b> laser <b>guidance</b> {{in place of the}} beam-riding system, and four enlarged fins for increased lift.|$|R
50|$|The Raytheon MIM-23 Hawk is an American medium-range surface-to-air missile. It was {{designed}} to be a much more mobile counterpart to the MIM-14 Nike Hercules, trading off range and altitude capability for a much smaller size and weight. Its low-level performance was greatly improved over Nike through the adoption of new radars and a continuous wave <b>semi-active</b> radar <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> system.|$|R
50|$|Aimed at {{addressing}} the major flaws of the AA.20, specifically {{the fact that}} the missile could not be used at night or in poor weather, the French developed the AA.25, which was essentially a radar-beam riding version of the AA.20, using the target-tracking beam of the CSF Cyrano Ibis radar fitted to the Mirage IIIC. Many AA.20 missiles were converted to AA.25 standard. A further version of the missile, designated the AA.26, with <b>semi-active</b> <b>homing</b> was planned but the competing R.511 missile was adopted instead.|$|R
2500|$|The {{production}} F-102A had the Hughes MG-3 {{fire control}} system, later upgraded {{in service to}} the MG-10. It had a three-segment internal weapons bay under the fuselage for air-to-air missiles. Initial armament was three pairs of GAR-1/2/3/4 (Later re-designated as AIM-4) Falcon missiles, which included both infrared <b>homing</b> and <b>semi-active</b> radar <b>homing</b> variants. [...] The doors of the two forward bays each had tubes for 12 FFARs (for a total of 24) with initially 2in (5.1cm) being fitted and later 2.75in (70mm) replacing them. The F-102 was later upgraded to allow the carrying of up to two GAR-11/AIM-26 Nuclear Falcon missiles in the center bay. The larger size of this weapon required redesigned center bay doors with no rocket tubes. Plans were considered to fit the MB-1 Genie nuclear rocket to the design, but although a Genie was test fired from a YF-102A in May 1956, it was never adopted.|$|R
50|$|Armament {{interceptor}} {{includes four}} supersonic (M>5) UR great range R-40T (R-40TD) air-to-air missiles with thermal homing head and R-40P (R-40RD) with <b>semi-active</b> radar <b>guidance</b> system (maximum launch range, on altitudinal goal {{on a collision}} course - 35-60 km). A fuel tank can be suspended under the fuselage. The aircraft could carry unguided gravity bombs in a rudimentary strike capability. As the bombs would weigh no more and incur no more drag than its regular load of R-40 missiles, its performance was not impaired, leading to some impressive bombing feats; when released at an altitude of 20,000m (66,000 ft) and a speed above Mach 2, a 500 kg bomb would have a glide range of several tens of kilometres.|$|R
50|$|The {{projectiles}} use laser guidance. A cone {{of laser}} light divided into sectors is projected from the launching tank/vehicle/gun, each sector having a different frequency or modulation. The missile {{has a small}} window in the rear with a sensor to detect the modulation of the light. Using this modulation, the missile steers itself, maintaining {{its position in the}} cone. The laser beam-riding guidance system is smaller than a radio command one, and cheaper and simpler than <b>semi-active</b> laser <b>guidance.</b> The missile is also not prone to radio or optical jamming. On the other hand, a target has to be tracked by laser sight all the time, and the system can not be reliably used on the move.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Semi-active</b> <b>homing</b> systems {{combine a}} passive radar {{receiver}} on the missile {{with a separate}} targeting radar that [...] "illuminates" [...] the target. Since the missile is typically being launched after the target was detected using a powerful radar system, {{it makes sense to}} use that same radar system to track the target, thereby avoiding problems with resolution or power, and reducing the weight of the missile. <b>Semi-active</b> radar <b>homing</b> (SARH) {{is by far the most}} common [...] "all weather" [...] guidance solution for anti-aircraft systems, both ground- and air-launched.|$|R
