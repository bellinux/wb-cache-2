5|$|In 1946, Szilard {{secured a}} {{research}} professorship at the University of Chicago {{that allowed him}} to dabble in biology and the social sciences. He teamed up with Aaron Novick, a chemist who had worked at the Metallurgical Laboratory during the war. The two men saw biology as a field that had not been explored as much as physics, and was ready for scientific breakthroughs. It was a field that Szilard had been working on in 1933 before he had become subsumed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> a nuclear chain reaction. The duo made considerable advances. They invented the chemostat, a device for regulating the growth rate of the microorganisms in a bioreactor, and developed methods for measuring the growth rate of bacteria. They discovered feedback inhibition, an important factor in processes such as growth and metabolism. Szilard gave essential advice to Theodore Puck and Philip I. Marcus for their first cloning of a human cell in 1955.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> {{a better}} {{production}} of platinum metals, two scientists, William Hyde Wollaston and Smithson Tennant, {{worked together to}} design an efficient electrochemical technique to refine or purify platinum. Tennant ended up discovering the elements iridium and osmium. Wollaston's effort, in turn, {{led him to the}} discovery of the metals palladium in 1803 and rhodium in 1804.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} period, Nationalism {{manifested}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> {{a new style}} of architecture — one that reflected the cultural identity of the region. Some architects began to temper the Modernist ethos by including indigenous architectural elements, thereby creating a distinctively Indonesian style of modern architecture. Maclaine Pont and Thomas Karsten were the leading exponents here.|$|E

25|$|In {{its early}} stages, the tale was {{probably}} unrelated to contemporary Arthurian literature, but the earliest surviving versions already incorporate references to Arthur and his court. The connection between Tristan and Iseult and the Arthurian legend was expanded over time, and sometime {{shortly after the}} completion of the Vulgate Cycle (or Lancelot-Grail Cycle) {{in the first quarter of}} the 13th century, two authors created the vast Prose Tristan, which fully establishes Tristan as a Knight of the Round Table who even participates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Quest</b> <b>for</b> the Holy Grail.|$|E

He fought as a professional from 1973 to 1978, but his record, including losses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>quests</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> world title and Japanese titles is mediocre (14 wins, 10 losses, and 1 draw).|$|R

25|$|Although gold {{deposits}} {{were not}} abundant on the Altiplano, through trading the Muisca obtained {{large amounts of}} the precious metal which they elaborated into fine art, of which the Muisca raft and the many tunjos (offer pieces) were the most important. The Muisca raft pictures the initiation ritual of the new zipa, {{that took place in}} Lake Guatavita. When the Spanish who resided in the coastal city of Santa Marta, founded by Rodrigo de Bastidas in 1525, were informed about this legend, a large expedition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> this El Dorado (city or man of gold) was organised in the spring of 1536.|$|E
25|$|Baltasar Maldonado {{is known}} as the conquistador who {{defeated}} the last ruling main cacique of the Muisca; Tundama, who he killed with a large hammer in late December 1539. Subsequently, Baltasar Maldonado took part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Quest</b> <b>for</b> El Dorado led by Hernán Pérez de Quesada in the southern regions of present-day Colombia. After this failed expedition, where many of the Spanish soldiers died of diseases, poisoned arrows and drowning in the numerous rivers of the Llanos Orientales and western Amazon River basin, Baltasar Maldonado returned to Popayán and Cali and traveled back to Bogotá, the capital of the New Kingdom of Granada where he died in 1552.|$|E
25|$|Countless {{partnerships}} {{have emerged}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> food security. A number of federal nutrition programs exist to provide food specifically for children, including the Summer Food Service Program, Special Milk Program (SMP) and Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), and community and state organizations often network with these programs. The Summer Food Program in Bangor, Maine, {{is run by}} the Bangor Housing Authority and sponsored by Good Shepherd Food Bank. In turn, Waterville Maine's Thomas College, for example, is among the organizations holding food drives to collect donations for Good Shepherd. Children whose families qualify for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) may also receive food assistance. WIC alone served approximately 7.6 million participants, 75% of which are children and infants.|$|E

25|$|During {{his college}} years, La Luz became {{involved}} in the Students for a Democratic Society, speaking out on issues such as the war in Vietnam. He also became involved with local Puerto Rican Farm Workers organizations in the Tobacco Valley in Connecticut and Massachusetts. La Luz was one of the key community organizers to secure new rights for migrant workers in the area by putting public pressure on the Labor Department of Puerto Rico and denouncing the deplorable conditions that the migrant workers were working under. He also helped merge the local farm workers with Cesar Chavez’s United Farm Workers of America. La Luz credits César Chávez and Martin Luther King, Jr. as being his greatest influences in understanding the importance of justice and dignity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> civil and human rights.|$|E
25|$|Although Jesus {{bloodline}} {{hypotheses were}} not {{submitted to the}} judgment of the Jesus Seminar, a group of scholars involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> the historical Jesus from a liberal Christian perspective, they were unable to determine whether Jesus and Mary Magdalene had a matrimonial relationship due to the dearth of historical evidence. They concluded that the historical Mary Magdalene was not a repentant prostitute but a prominent disciple of Jesus and a leader in the early Christian movement. Bart D. Ehrman, who chairs the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina, commented that, although there are some historical scholars who claim that it is likely that Jesus was married, the vast majority of New Testament and early Christianity scholars find such a claim to be historically unreliable.|$|E
25|$|In {{the post-war}} period times were reduced again by /with {{the advent of}} {{turboprop}} airliners, such as the Lockheed Constellation. Hopes in 1952 were expressed for the new de Havilland Comet jetliner, though these were dashed by the succession of crashes that halted the Comet programme. A regular jetliner service was finally introduced in 1958 with the Boeing 707 and the DC 8, cutting the crossing to 7 hours. The final step <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> trans-Atlantic speed was the BAC Concorde, which set a record in 1996 of a second under two hours 53 minutes, at an average speed of 1250mph (Mach 1.9), but by this time airlines were aware that cost and comfort were more important to passengers than speed, and the emphasis shifted to aircraft like the Boeing 747, with a sleeper capacity for business passengers.|$|E

25|$|The first Europeans {{who saw the}} Bogotá savanna and the Eastern Hills {{were the}} {{soldiers}} of conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada who participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> El Dorado. The period of conquest commenced {{when they reached the}} flatlands of the Bogotá savanna from the north. Although around 800 soldiers started the expedition, only 120 reached the inner Andes. They spent the Holy Week of 1537 in Chía, that was founded by the Granadian leader on March 24 after passing through Cajicá one day earlier. From here, setting up camp on the Suba Hills on April 5, the conquistadors continued southwestward towards Bacatá or Muequetá, located in modern Funza, the main settlement of the zipa Tisquesusa. The leader of the southern Muisca was defeated quickly and the Spanish set up their main camp in Bosa. Conquistador Pedro Fernández de Valenzuela was sent towards the site of Teusaquillo, where the zipa had a bohío (house). From Bosa, various expeditions on the Altiplano were organised during 1537 and early 1538. On August 6 of that year, the city of Santafé de Bogotá was officially founded as the capital of the New Kingdom of Granada.|$|E

500|$|For {{years after}} {{the loss of the}} Franklin Party, the Victorian media portrayed Franklin as a hero who led his men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> the Northwest Passage.

Although the expedition's fate, including the possibility of cannibalism, was widely reported and debated, Franklin's standing with the Victorian public was undiminished. The expedition {{has been the subject of}} numerous works of non-fiction, including two books by Ken McGoogan, Fatal Passage and Lady Franklin's Revenge.|$|E
