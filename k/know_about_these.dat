25|$|Plato was the {{innovator}} of {{the written}} dialogue and dialectic forms in philosophy. Plato {{appears to have been}} the founder of Western political philosophy, with his Republic, and Laws among other dialogues, providing some of the earliest extant treatments of political questions from a philosophical perspective. Plato's own most decisive philosophical influences are usually thought to have been Socrates, Parmenides, Heraclitus and Pythagoras, although few of his predecessors' works remain extant and much of what we <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> figures today derives from Plato himself.|$|E
500|$|On {{creating}} the story, Spears stated, [...] "The best part {{for me as}} a writer was to show some events from the movie from a different point of view, sort of like Rashomon for you Kurosawa fans. And with comics we can get into the character's heads in a way that works well in comics and novels more so than in film." [...] He stated, [...] "...I was using the medium to change what we really <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> characters and twist around what we see in the movies. All the academics aside, it's also very funny and gore splattered." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{slow motion}} and fade effects {{at the end}} of the episode were not scripted, but the {{decision}} to use them was made in editing after the final scene was hastily filmed on an unconvincing polystyrene set, ruining the poignancy of the sequence; the episode's director Richard Boden added the poppy field image. The piano version of the theme tune was performed by Howard Goodall and recorded in a gymnasium, giving it what Lloyd described as a [...] "liquid, lonely sound". The episode's end credits were omitted. Tim McInnerny did not <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> changes before the episode aired, and has said that he found the ending particularly emotional.|$|E
500|$|In January 1966, Eastwood met {{producer}} Dino De Laurentiis in New York City {{and agreed}} to star in a non-Western five-part anthology production named Le Streghe ("The Witches") opposite De Laurentiis' wife, actress Silvana Mangano. Eastwood's nineteen-minute installment took {{only a few days}} to shoot, but his performance did not please the critics, one writing that [...] "no other performance of his is quite so 'un-Clintlike'." [...] Two months later Eastwood began work on the third Dollars film, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, again playing the mysterious Man with No Name. Lee Van Cleef returned as a ruthless fortune seeker, with Eli Wallach portraying the cunning Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez. The storyline involved the search for a cache of Confederate gold buried in a cemetery. During the filming of a scene in which a bridge was blown up, Eastwood urged Wallach to retreat to a hilltop. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things," [...] he said. [...] "Stay as far away from special effects and explosives as you can." [...] Minutes later confusion among the crew over the word [...] "Vaya!" [...] resulted in a premature explosion that could have killed Wallach.|$|E
2500|$|During 1916, aerial {{reconnaissance}} patrols had most often been unaccompanied, as {{there had been}} little if any aerial disputes between the belligerents. However, just as the ground war on the Gaza to Beersheba line came to resemble trench warfare on the western front, so too did the air war over southern Palestine come to resemble that being fought over France. By April 1917 the growing concentration of forces holding established front lines, the development of associated supply dumps and lines of communications, {{and the need to}} <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> developments, fuelled [...] "intense rivalry in the air." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sergi López as Captain Vidal, Ofelia's new {{stepfather}} and a Falange officer. Del Toro {{met with}} López in Barcelona, {{a year and}} a half before filming began, to ask him to play Vidal. In Spain, López was considered a melodramatic or comedic actor, and the producers told Del Toro [...] "You should be very careful because you don't <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things because you're Mexican, but this guy is not going to be able to deliver the performance"; del Toro replied [...] "Well, it's not that I don't know, it's that I don't care". Of his character, López said: [...] "He is the most evil character I've ever played in my career. It is impossible to improve upon it; the character is so solid and so well written. Vidal is deranged, a psychopath who is impossible to defend. Even though his father's personality marked his existence—and is certainly one of the reasons for his mental disorder—that cannot be an excuse. It would seem to be very cynical to use that to justify or explain his cruel and cowardly acts. I think it is great that the film does not consider any justification of fascism." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2014, Snowden {{said his}} [...] "breaking point" [...] was [...] "seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, {{directly}} lie under oath to Congress." [...] This referred to testimony on March 12, 2013—three months after Snowden first sought to share thousands of NSA documents with Greenwald, and {{nine months after}} the NSA says Snowden made his first illegal downloads {{during the summer of}} 2012—in which Clapper denied to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the NSA wittingly collects data on millions of Americans. Snowden said, [...] "There's no saving an intelligence community that believes it can lie to the public and the legislators who {{need to be able to}} trust it and regulate its actions. Seeing that really meant for me there was no going back. Beyond that, it was the creeping realization that no one else was going to do this. The public had a right to <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> programs." [...] In March 2014, Snowden stated that he had reported policy or legal issues related to spying programs to more than ten officials, but as a contractor had no legal avenue to pursue further whistleblowing. In May 2014, Vanity Fair reported that Snowden first contemplated leaking confidential documents around 2008 but held back, partly because he believed the newly elected Barack Obama might introduce reforms.|$|E
2500|$|... "How is it {{possible}} for MPs to consult with their constituencies about the bills if they have not yet received them less than a week before Parliament is due to sit to discuss them? If MPs cannot consult with their electorates about the bills, how can they properly represent their views about these bills which will become laws that will affect their day-to-day lives? Such late notice and late provision of the bills demonstrates that the Government is not at all committed to the “stampa” principle of democracy and good governance, which is the representation of the people by leaders they elect to represent them. It reflects the Government’s attitude that because it has a majority in Parliament - which means its bills will automatically be passed - {{there is no need for}} the grassroots to <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> laws that it intends to pass, which will nevertheless affect their lives. This is an arrogant and undemocratic attitude which, unfortunately, has come to characterize our system of parliamentary democracy and particularly the approach of the major parties which have been in Government over the last 20 years. [...] I have been telling communities in Port Vila that I will consult with them about the 2009 Government budget, to get their views to present in Parliament, and I am very disappointed and angry that the Government, by their late notice, has meant that this will be very difficult, if not impossible." ...|$|E
