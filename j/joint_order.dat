The problem of determining efficient <b>joint</b> <b>ordering</b> policies has the same structure as the previously-examined problem of determining the efficient ordering policy for a single product. Efficient joint lot-sizes are independent of prices, and are supported by a range of average-unit prices that permit every possible allocation of the transactions-cost saving between the buyer and the seller.

25|$|In mid-2003, due to {{cross-contamination}} at a Madison, Wisconsin-area pet swap from an unquarantined Gambian {{pouched rat}} imported from Ghana, several prairie dogs in captivity acquired monkeypox, and subsequently a few humans were also infected.

Believing that any further assaults would be futile, Song Shi-Lun ordered the 9th Army to switch their main attacks toward Sinhung-ni and Hagaru-ri, leaving Yudam-ni alone from 28 November to 30 November. At the same time, the US Eighth Army on the Korean western front was forced into full retreat at the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River, and MacArthur ordered Almond to withdraw the US X Corps to the port of Hungnam. Acting on the instruction of Almond and Smith, Lieutenant Colonel Raymond L. Murray and Colonel Homer L.

60|$|Among {{the public}} were Euphemia Smith and Mr. Crinkett,--Adamson also, and Anna Young, the other witness. Since the trial, this confraternity had not passed an {{altogether}} fraternal life. When the money had been paid, {{the woman had}} insisted on having the half. She, indeed, had carried the cheque for the amount away from the Jericho Coffee-house. It had been given into her hands and those of Crinkett conjointly, and she had secured the document. The amount was payable to their <b>joint</b> <b>order,</b> and each had felt {{that it would be}} better to divide the spoil in peace. Crinkett had taken his half with many grumblings, because he had, in truth, arranged the matter and hitherto paid the expenses. Then the woman had wished to start at once for Australia, taking the other female with her. But to this Crinkett had objected. They would certainly, he said, be arrested for breaking their bail at whatever port they might reach,--and why should they go, seeing that the money had been paid to them on the distinct understanding that they were not pledged to abandon the prosecution. Most unwillingly the woman remained;--but did so fearing lest worse evil might betide her. Then there had arisen quarrels about the money between the two females, and between Crinkett and Adamson. It was in vain that Crinkett showed that, were he to share with Adamson, there would be very little of the plunder left to him. Adamson demanded a quarter of the whole, short of a quarter of the expenses, declaring that were it not paid to him, he would divulge everything to the police. The woman, who had got her money in her hand, and who was, in truth, spending it very quickly, would give back nothing for expenses, unless her expenses in England also were considered. Nor would she give a shilling to Anna Young, beyond an allowance of £2 a week, till, as she said, they were both back in the colony again. But Anna Young did not wish to go back to the colony. And so they quarrelled till the trial came and was over.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{develops}} optimal inventory {{models for}} a firm with multiple items and multiple branches by {{taking into account}} the price discount of sizable procurement and the scale economies of centralized warehousing and consolidated transportation. Four inventory strategies are proposed: independent ordering and decentralized warehousing, independent ordering and centralized warehousing, <b>joint</b> <b>ordering</b> and decentralized warehousing, and <b>joint</b> <b>ordering</b> and centralized warehousing. The performances of pure policy (all items subject to adopting only one of the four strategies) and mixed policy (different items allowed to adopting different strategies) are compared. The mixed policy employs genetic stepwise clustering and statistical agglomerative clustering methods to classify items into appropriate clusters and then to determine the best strategy for each cluster. A firm of four branches with fifty heterogeneous items is analyzed. It is found that, in terms of total cost minimization (including ordering, warehousing, transportation and procurement costs), the mixed policy with clustering is superior to pure policy without clustering. For mixed policy, genetic stepwise clustering performs better than statistical agglomerative clustering...|$|R
