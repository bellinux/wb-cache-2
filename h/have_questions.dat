2500|$|Following the {{expansion}} of his role from turntablist to keyboardist on Light Grenades (2006), Chris Kilmore stated that, during the band's hiatus, he [...] "took a lot of piano lessons and {{did a lot of}} learning keyboards.

I was scratching a little bit, but mostly keys, because my role in this band has kind of evolved. So to pick up a new instrument and learn it in a few years was hard to do. [...] I’m really serious and focused about it, that’s what the rehearsals are for, hitting all those wrong notes. But I <b>have</b> <b>questions,</b> {{and there is a lot}} of people around me that I can ask, Ben is an incredible musician, Mike is an incredible musician and composer, and if I need something explained or helped with, I don’t have to go far to get an answer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thernstrom's stance {{has been}} sharply criticized by other conservatives, such as federal {{prosecutor}} Andrew C. McCarthy, {{who wrote a}} response to Thernstrom in a later issue of National Review. He points out that a year earlier Thernstrom had been among those criticizing the Obama administration's decision to dismiss the case, {{and that she had}} not explained the reason for her reversal of opinion. McCarthy referred to the comment by Bartle Bull, who witnessed the incident, that it was the most blatant form of voter intimidation he had ever encountered in his life, as well as {{the fact that it was}} highly unusual for the case to be dismissed after a default judgment against the defendants had already been won. In reply to McCarthy, Thernstrom clarified her opinion by stating that [...] "I still <b>have</b> <b>questions</b> about DOJ's conduct, and I remain interested in knowing more about why the department declined to pursue the case." [...] However, she added that as she learned more about the case, she became doubtful it was as severe an example of voter intimidation as it first appeared to be, and was of the opinion that [...] "the incident was not of sufficient importance to be the primary focus of our yearlong project." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{political}} science professors questioned whether Obama's speech {{would have the}} effect he hoped for in terms of distancing himself from the controversial comments made by Wright and allaying the concerns {{of a number of}} white voters. Michael Munger—head of the {{political science}} department at Duke University, and a Libertarian candidate for Governor of North Carolina in 2008—called the speech [...] "brave", but said that Obama was [...] "being naive". Munger argued that [...] " [...] black candidate named Barack Hussein Obama can't <b>have</b> <b>questions</b> about his patriotism, and commitment to America, not if he is going to beat a genuine war hero" [...] (a reference to John McCain and the general election). He argued that Obama [...] "had to distance himself far from Wright. Instead, he was brave." [...] Susan B. Hansen of the University of Pittsburgh noted that [...] "the dilemma for Obama is that the more he talks about race being unimportant or transcended, the more important it will become to the media and voters' perceptions." [...] She suggested Obama did not put the Wright issue to rest and that, if Obama became the nominee, Wright's comments would no doubt {{play a role in the}} general election as fodder for Republican attacks against him. Similarly, Eric Plutzer of Penn State argued that Obama's speech [...] "did not put the Rev. Wright controversy behind him. Those skeptical of Obama are likely to continue to distribute video clips, and quotes of Obama's own words, to argue that his reaction was not sufficiently strong..." ...|$|E

It is possible to sin without being damned; and to be damned is to be in a state when sin scarcely matters, like ink upon a blackamoor.

60|$|Every day, then, for the {{following}} three weeks, the minutely respectable figure of M. Nioche made its appearance, {{with a series of}} little inquiring and apologetic obeisances, among the aromatic fumes of Newman's morning beverage. I don't know how much French our friend learned, but, as he himself said, if the attempt did him no good, it could at any rate do him no harm. And it amused him; it gratified that irregularly sociable side of his nature which had always expressed itself in a relish for ungrammatical conversation, and which often, even in his busy and preoccupied days, had made him sit on rail fences in young Western towns, in the twilight, in gossip hardly less than fraternal with humorous loafers and obscure fortune-seekers. He had notions, wherever he went, about talking with the natives; he had been assured, and his judgment approved the advice, that in traveling abroad it was an excellent thing to look into the life of the country. M. Nioche was very much of a native and, though his life might not be particularly worth looking into, he was a palpable and smoothly-rounded unit in that picturesque Parisian civilization which offered our hero so much easy entertainment and propounded so many curious problems to his inquiring and practical mind. Newman was fond of statistics; he liked to know how things were done; it gratified him to learn what taxes were paid, what profits were gathered, what commercial habits prevailed, how the battle of life was fought. M. Nioche, as a reduced capitalist, was familiar with these considerations, and he formulated his information, which he was proud to be able to impart, in the neatest possible terms and with a pinch of snuff between finger and thumb. As a Frenchman--quite apart from Newman's napoleons--M. Nioche loved conversation, and even in his decay his urbanity had not grown rusty. As a Frenchman, too, he could give a clear account of things, and--still as a Frenchman--when his knowledge was at fault he could supply its lapses with the most convenient and ingenious hypotheses. The little shrunken financier was intensely delighted to <b>have</b> <b>questions</b> asked him, and he scraped together information, by frugal processes, and took notes, in his little greasy pocket-book, of incidents which might interest his munificent friend. He read old almanacs at the book-stalls on the quays, and he began to frequent another cafe, where more newspapers were taken and his postprandial demitasse cost him a penny extra, and where he used to con the tattered sheets for curious anecdotes, freaks of nature, and strange coincidences. He would relate with solemnity the next morning that a child of five years of age had lately died at Bordeaux, whose brain had been found to weigh sixty ounces--the brain of a Napoleon or a Washington! or that Madame P--, charcutiere in the Rue de Clichy, had found in the wadding of an old petticoat the sum of three hundred and sixty francs, which she had lost five years before. He pronounced his words with great distinctness and sonority, and Newman assured him that his way of dealing with the French tongue was very superior to the bewildering chatter that he heard in other mouths. Upon this M. Nioche's accent became more finely trenchant than ever, he offered to read extracts from Lamartine, and he protested that, although he did endeavor according to his feeble lights to cultivate refinement of diction, monsieur, if he wanted the real thing, should go to the Theatre Francais.|$|E
