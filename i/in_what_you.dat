5|$|Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm {{talking to}} you by {{telephone}} from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly {{has to be the}} most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E
25|$|By 1601, he {{was well}} known in London {{literary}} circles, particularly {{in his role as}} enemy to the equally pugnacious Ben Jonson. Jonson, who reported to Drummond that Marston had accused him of sexual profligacy, satirized Marston in Clove in Every Man Out of His Humour, as Crispinus in Poetaster, and as Hedon in Cynthia's Revels. Jonson criticised Marston for being a false poet, a vain, careless writer who plagiarised the works of others and whose own works were marked by bizarre diction and ugly neologisms. For his part, Marston may have satirized Jonson as the complacent, arrogant critic Brabant Senior in Jack Drum's Entertainment and as the envious, misanthropic playwright and satirist Lampatho Doria <b>in</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Will.|$|E
500|$|Flack notes a {{distinction}} between the [...] "strong sense" [...] of Nonviolent Communication as a virtue that is possible with care and attention, and the [...] "weak sense," [...] a mimicry of this born of ego and haste. The strong sense offers a language to examine one's thinking and actions, support understanding, bring one's best to the community, and honor one's emotions. In the weak sense, one may take the language as rules and use these to score debating points, label others for political gain, or insist that others express themselves in this way. Though concerned that some of what Rosenberg says could lead to the weak sense, Flack sees evidence confirming that Rosenberg understands the strong sense in practice. Rosenberg's work with workshop attendees demonstrates [...] "the real thing." [...] Yet Flack warns that [...] "the temptation of the weak sense will not be absent." [...] As an antidote, Flack advises, [...] "Be conservative <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do, be liberal <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> accept from others," [...] (also known as the robustness principle) and guard against the [...] "metamorphosis of nonviolent communication into subtle violence done in its name." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{definition}} of an XML document excludes texts that contain violations of well-formedness rules; they are simply not XML. An XML processor that encounters such a violation is required to report such errors and to cease normal processing. This policy, occasionally referred to as [...] "draconian error handling," [...] stands in notable contrast to the behavior of programs that process HTML, which are designed to produce a reasonable result even {{in the presence of}} severe markup errors. XML's policy in this area has been criticized as a violation of Postel's law ("Be conservative <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> send; be liberal <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> accept").|$|E

[...] "The {{second part of the}} principle is almost as important: software on other hosts may contain deficiencies that make it unwise to exploit legal but obscure protocol features." [...] Postel famously summarized the principle as, [...] "Be conservative <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do, be liberal <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> accept from others"—a saying that {{came to be known as}} [...] "Postel's Law." ...|$|E
2500|$|On a {{publicity}} tour for Past Mortem in 2004, Elton mused {{on the high}} school reunion theme and his own drama college reunion: We'd had a very happy time all together, so there were no old scores to be settled really, we'd been a pretty happy bunch. And yet one person, who'd been a bit of a golden boy – he certainly went out with a girl I was besotted and unrequitedly in love with – he came up and he said, 'Why did you come? Was it to show off?' That really surprised me, that anyone would think that ... he came kind of carrying my agenda. It was weird. I hasten to add I didn't think my life to be more successful than anybody else's. If you're happy and honest and fulfilled <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do, then you're having a successful life.|$|E

He commented: [...] "We're pretty psyched because {{we already know}} what we're gonna do. But I'm not gonna tell you. It's really important for us that the new album will be our best effort.

2500|$|In 2002, Kidman won {{critical}} {{praise for}} her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in Stephen Daldry's The Hours, which stars Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. Kidman famously wore prosthetics that {{were applied to}} her nose making her almost unrecognisable playing the author during her time in 1920s England, and her bouts with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel, Mrs. Dalloway. The film earned positive notices and several nominations, including for an Academy Award for Best Picture. The New York Times wrote that, [...] "Ms. Kidman, in a performance of astounding bravery, evokes the savage inner war waged by a brilliant mind against a system of faulty wiring that transmits a searing, crazy static into her brain". Kidman won numerous critics' awards, including her first BAFTA, third Golden Globe, and the Academy Award for Best Actress. As the first Australian actress to win an Academy Award, Kidman made a teary acceptance speech {{about the importance of}} art, even during times of war, saying, [...] "Why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil? Because art is important. And because you believe <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do and you want to honour that, and it is a tradition that needs to be upheld." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some Christians {{note that}} the Christian faith teaches [...] "salvation is by faith", [...] "But as for you, {{continue}} <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which {{are able to make}} you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus." [...] The Holy Bible, New International Version. International Bible Society. 1984. and that faith is reliance upon the faithfulness of God. The most extreme example of this position is called fideism, which holds that faith is simply the will to believe, and argues that if God's existence were rationally demonstrable, faith in its existence would become superfluous. Søren Kierkegaard argued that objective knowledge, such as 1+1=2, is unimportant to existence. If God could rationally be proven, his existence would be unimportant to humans. It is because God cannot rationally be proven that his existence is important to us. In The Justification of Knowledge, the Calvinist theologian Robert L. Reymond argues that believers should not attempt to prove the existence of God. Since he believes all such proofs are fundamentally unsound, believers should not place their confidence in them, much less resort to them in discussions with non-believers; rather, they should accept the content of revelation by faith. Reymond's position {{is similar to that of}} his mentor Gordon Clark, which holds that all worldviews are based on certain unprovable first premises (or, axioms), and therefore are ultimately unprovable. The Christian theist therefore must simply choose to start with Christianity rather than anything else, by a [...] "leap of faith". This position is also sometimes called presuppositional apologetics, but should not be confused with the Van Tillian variety.|$|E
