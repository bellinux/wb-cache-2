5|$|Dell Williams, {{founder of}} the first feminist sex toy {{business}} in the United States, Eve's Garden, was inspired to launch her store after using a Magic Wand as a student in Dodson's course in the early 1970s. Williams said the Magic Wand was her favorite sex toy because of its dependability and its power at delivering pleasure to the clitoris. In 1974, Dodson recommended the device in her book Liberating Masturbation. In 1975 in her demonstrations, she replaced the Panasonic Panabrator with the Magic Wand. In 1977, Dodson recommended the device to Dian Hanson, <b>former</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> men's magazines Leg Show and Juggs. Hanson recalled her initial experience after receiving the recommendation from Dodson. Hanson said she was instructed to purchase the Magic Wand but was advised to be cautious regarding its emotional and physical influence because it could have properties which could cause habit-forming dependency. She observed that in comparison to her prior vibrator operated by two D batteries, the Magic Wand was significantly more effective.|$|E
5|$|Following a brief {{interlude}} by From Hell artist Eddie Campbell, the series' direction {{was taken}} over by Paul Jenkins in 1995. He had been <b>former</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and other Mirage Studios lines. He had pitched to several comic houses, having tired of editing, and eventually managed to gain stewardship of Hellblazer, the first largely untested writer to achieve this. Jenkins' run is more traditionally English in its themes, with Albion, Arthurian legend, and old English battles all featuring, and even an appearance by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and a speculative explanation of the writing of Kubla Khan, and what the interruption of the 'man from Porlock' may have been. He also returns to Jamie Delano's coverage of anarchist lifestyles, and the effects of the Criminal Justice Act of 1994, a controversial law which restricted the ability of the public to throw raves and large demonstrations.|$|E
