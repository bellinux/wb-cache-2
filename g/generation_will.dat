5|$|A third form of progeny {{arises when}} F1 hybrids are bred with animals genetically {{dissimilar}} to their parents. If heterozygosity is maintained or increased as a result, hybrid vigour and other production benefits {{occurring in the}} F1 <b>generation</b> <b>will</b> be maintained or increased. Maintenance of heterozygosity {{is the key to}} maintaining the highest levels of hybrid vigour. This requires complex breeding programmes and high levels of management. Simplified crossbreeding programmes have been developed using hybrid or composite bulls, which was the motivation behind the development of Lim-Flex hybrids.|$|E
5|$|Power {{generation}} is managed by China Yangtze Power, a listed subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation (CTGC)—a Central Enterprise SOE administered by SASAC. The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest capacity {{hydroelectric power station}} with 34generators: 32 main generators, each with a capacity of 700MW, and two plant power generators, each with capacity of 50MW, making a total capacity of 22,500MW. Among those 32 main generators, 14 are installed in {{the north side of}} the dam, 12 in the south side, and the remaining six in the underground power plant in the mountain south of the dam.

25|$|Minority {{populations have}} {{increased}} exposure to environmental hazards that include lack of neighborhood resources, structural and community factors {{as well as}} residential segregation that result in a cycle of disease and stress. The environment that surrounds us can influence individual behaviors and lead to poor health choices and therefore outcomes. Minority neighborhoods have been continuously noted to have more fast food chains and fewer grocery stores than predominantly white neighborhoods. These food deserts affect a family’s ability to {{have easy access to}} nutritious food for their children. This lack of nutritious food extends beyond the household into the schools that have a variety of vending machines and deliver over processed foods.

25|$|Overall, Jean-Jacques Furer {{concludes that}} the {{shrinkage}} of the Romansh-speaking areas is continuing, though at different rates depending on the region. At the same time, he notes that Romansh {{is still very much}} alive, a fact that is obvious in those areas where it retains a strong presence, such as most parts of the Surselva and the Lower Engadine. It is also assured that Romansh will continue to be transmitted for several more generations, even though each succeeding <b>generation</b> <b>will</b> be more and more rooted in German as well as Romansh. As a result, if the overall linguistic situation does not change, speakers will slowly become fewer and fewer with each generation. He also concludes however, that there are still enough speakers to ensure that Romansh will survive in the long term at least in certain regions. He considers the Romansh-language school system to be the single most crucial factor in this.|$|E

25|$|Mainstream {{record labels}} in India often ignore rock, {{with a few}} exceptions. Album sales range between a few hundred copies to a few thousand. They are rarely, if at all, {{affiliated}} to the Indian music industry, and sales are not usually monitored. Songs of Bollywood usually gain more popularity {{as compared to the}} songs of bands. This is a huge set back. Bands also fail to sell their songs throughout the country even after making it available to major music stores, this is only due to lack of interest of people in rock bands. There are only a few bands that have become successful in selling their songs throughout the country. People who enjoy rock get the songs of their favorite bands, just by a click from any music website (sometimes their songs are uploaded by website administrators just after the day of release, this is illegal as per copyright law, but even then no action is taken). Hence, overall sales become less than expected. Bands in India mostly perform live shows with low priced tickets (as low as Rs. 100 or even less). Probably, the growing and the upcoming <b>generation</b> <b>will</b> have interest in Indian Rock and Metal. But care has to be taken to retain the copyright of the music.|$|E
25|$|Evolution {{does not}} attempt to explain {{the origin of life}} (covered instead by abiogenesis), but it does explain how the {{extremely}} simple early lifeforms evolved into the complex ecosystem that we see today. Based on the similarities between all present-day organisms, all life on Earth originated through common descent from a last universal ancestor from which all known species have diverged through the process of evolution. All individuals have hereditary material in the form of genes that are received from their parents, then passed on to any offspring. Among offspring there are variations of genes due to the introduction of new genes via random changes called mutations or via reshuffling of existing genes during sexual reproduction. The offspring differs from the parent in minor random ways. If those differences are helpful, the offspring is more likely to survive and reproduce. This means that more offspring in the next <b>generation</b> <b>will</b> have that helpful difference and individuals will not have equal chances of reproductive success. In this way, traits that result in organisms being better adapted to their living conditions become more common in descendant populations. These differences accumulate resulting in changes within the population. This process is responsible for the many diverse life forms in the world.|$|E
25|$|Melanoma only {{occurs in}} a small {{proportion}} of the population. Only 10% of those who have melanoma acquired it genetically. This disease is an autosomal dominant gene. If only two family members have melanoma, there is a 5% chance somebody in the next <b>generation</b> <b>will</b> acquire the mutated gene. Also, there is a 20-40% chance of getting hereditary melanoma in a family if 3 or more people in the past generation had melanoma. For those who carry the hereditary mutated gene CDKN2A, acquiring skin cancer is a lot easier. Those who have the gene {{are far more likely to}} get melanoma a second or third time compared to those who don’t genetically have this gene. The population that is affected by this mutation has a high familial history of melanoma or atypical moles and birth marks in large numbers, a history of primary melanoma/cancers in general, immunosuppression, skin that burns easily and doesn't tan, freckling, blue eyes, red hair, or a history of blistering. People with these high risk factors are more likely to carry inherited mutations in CDKN2A. For those who have a gene mutation, the severity is also dependent on the environmental surroundings. Out of those who carry the gene, those who express the phenotype and actually developed melanoma have a history of more sun exposure, and light skin compared to those who also had the gene but never actually developed melanoma. This suggests that this gene co-works with ones surrounding environment. If two individuals are selected who carry the CDKN2A mutation, and both genetically have the same probability of acquiring skin cancer, but one is from Australia and the other is from Europe, there is a 58% the European will acquire cancer compared to a 91% chance the Australian will get it. This is because the factors mentioned earlier pertaining to those who are more susceptible to the disease and also dependent on the amount of sunscreen one wears and the UV radiation potency in their environment.|$|E
