5|$|Michael Moorcock {{was one of}} {{the first}} scifi authors to depict {{positive}} portrayals of homosexual, lesbian and bisexual relationships and sex in his novels. For example, in his 1965 novel, The <b>Final</b> <b>Programme,</b> most of the leading characters, including the central 'hero' Jerry Cornelius, engage in same sex relationships on multiple occasions and same sex relationships are depicted as entirely normal and without any moralising, negative consequences or gratuitous titillation, this is the case in the whole Jerry Cornelius series and in Moorcock's fiction generally (particularly in the Dancers at the End of Time series) sexuality is seen as polymorphic and fluid rather than based in fixed identities and gender roles.|$|E
5|$|Though Stowell's {{hypothesis}} was incorrect, his article rekindled {{interest in the}} Jack the Ripper case, and in 1973 the BBC launched a television series, Jack the Ripper, which investigated the Whitechapel murders. The series mixed documentary and drama; it featured real evidence but was hosted by fictional detectives Barlow and Watt, played by Stratford Johns and Frank Windsor, respectively. The series {{was made into a}} book, The Ripper File, by Elwyn Jones and John Lloyd in 1975. The sixth and <b>final</b> <b>programme</b> included a testimony by Joseph Gorman, who called himself Joseph Sickert and claimed to be the illegitimate son of noted painter Walter Sickert. Gorman claimed that Sickert had told him a story that implicated not only the royal family but also a host of other famous people in the murders. According to Gorman, Gull committed the murders with the help of accomplices. Stowell had mentioned rumours implicating Gull in his article, but had dismissed them as unfair and false.|$|E
25|$|Noel's House Party was {{a staple}} of BBC1's autumn and spring {{schedules}} for more than eight years.

25|$|TVS ceased {{broadcasting}} to {{the south}} and south east of England at just before midnight on 31 December 1992. While most other ITV stations were broadcasting the Thames Television farewell programme The End of the Year Show, TVS chose to opt out and air its own <b>final</b> <b>programme</b> entitled Goodbye to All That, a retrospective of its programming presented by Fred Dinenage and Fern Britton, recorded in front of a studio audience at the Northam studios in Southampton earlier. The programme closed with an amended version of the TVS ident, along with the message Thanks for watching before crossing to Big Ben for the New Year chimes at midnight and the handover to Meridian Broadcasting.|$|E
25|$|Michael Parkinson always sought guests who, {{besides being}} well known, {{had some sort}} of story to relate. He then saw his job as {{allowing}} them to tell it and did so by being open, relaxed and attentive. (He learnt very early on that in order to be an adept interviewer, he had to be a good listener.) He researched his subjects thoroughly, and, in the early shows, always had his list of questions to hand. Having guided them to an area of discussion, he rarely interrupted his guests — except to provide the occasional prompt — instead letting them expand on a particular topic. Sometimes, a person would warm to this style with unpredictable results. For example, he regards his chats with Shirley MacLaine as bordering on flirtatious. In his <b>final</b> <b>programme,</b> broadcast 22 December 2007, Parkinson stated that one of his most memorable interviews was with Jacob Bronowski in 1973.|$|E
500|$|On 21 June 1941, {{while he}} was in the middle of playing a game of cricket, Wodehouse {{received}} a visit from two members of the Gestapo. He was given ten minutes to pack his things before he was taken to the Hotel Adlon, a top luxury hotel in Berlin. He stayed there at his own expense; royalties from the German editions of his books had been put into a special frozen bank account at the outset of the war, and Wodehouse was permitted to draw upon this money he had earned whilst [...] staying in Berlin. He was thus released from internment a few months before his sixtieth birthday—the age at which civilian internees were released by the Nazis. Shortly afterwards Wodehouse was, in the words of Phelps, [...] "cleverly trapped" [...] into making five broadcasts to the US via German radio, with the Berlin-based correspondent of the Columbia Broadcasting System. The broadcasts—aired on 28 June, 9, 23 and 30 July, and 6 August—were titled How to be an Internee Without Previous Training, and comprised humorous anecdotes about Wodehouse's experiences as a prisoner, including some gentle mocking of captors. The German propaganda ministry arranged for the recordings to be broadcast to Britain in August. The day after Wodehouse recorded his <b>final</b> <b>programme,</b> Ethel joined him in Berlin, having sold most of her jewellery to pay for the journey.|$|E

2500|$|The Southampton {{base was}} the company's {{corporate}} headquarters and its primary production and transmission centre. These studios were purchased by TVS from its predecessor Southern, but TVS was delayed in {{the purchase of}} the site by Southern and therefore had to initially operate prior to launch from temporary buildings in the Southern car park, leading to Southern contemptuously naming them Portakabin TV, as referenced in a satirical song performed by Richard Stilgoe on Southern's <b>final</b> <b>programme.</b> [...] TVS finally completed {{the purchase of the}} Southampton site, equipment, news library and staff pension fund in August 1981. Also included in the sale was land purchased by Southern for planned new studios in Maidstone. Upon purchase TVS made significant investment, including building a new scenery block {{to the rear of the}} existing site. After losing its contract TVS sold the studios to its successor Meridian Broadcasting in mid-1992. The studios were closed by Meridian in 2004 and were demolished in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Another of Moorcock's popular creations is Jerry Cornelius, {{a kind of}} hip urban adventurer of {{ambiguous}} gender; {{the same}} characters featured in each of several Cornelius books. These books were most obviously satirical of modern times, including the Vietnam War, and continue to feature as another variation of the Multiverse theme. The first Jerry Cornelius book, The <b>Final</b> <b>Programme</b> (1968), {{was made into a}} feature film in 1973. Its story line is essentially identical to two of the Elric stories: The Dreaming City and The Dead Gods' Book. Since 1998, Moorcock has returned to Cornelius in a series of new stories: The Spencer Inheritance, The Camus Connection, Cheering for the Rockets, and Firing the Cathedral, which was concerned with 9/11. All four novellas were included in the 2003 edition of The Lives and Times of Jerry Cornelius. Moorcock's most recent Cornelius story, [...] "Modem Times", appeared in The Solaris Book of New Science Fiction: Volume 2, published in 2008, this was expanded in 2011 as [...] "Modem Times 2.0". Additionally, a version of Cornelius also appeared in Moorcock's 2010 Doctor Who novel The Coming of the Terraphiles.|$|E
