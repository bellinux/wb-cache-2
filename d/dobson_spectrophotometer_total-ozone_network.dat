Results from the TOMS/Dobson instrument comparisons through 1990 have been presented by McPeters and Komhyr (1991). <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> 83 was established as the standard instrument for the U. S. A. Dobson instrument station network in 1962. In 1980, the instrument was designated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) as the Standard <b>Dobson</b> <b>Spectrophotometer</b> for the World. Long-term ozone measurement precision of the instrument has been maintained at plus or minus 0. 5 percent (Komhyr et al., 1989). On an absolute scale, the ozone measurement accuracy of the instrument is estimated to plus or minus 3 percent. In early April, 1990, comparison of total ozone and vertical distribution (Umkehr) observations were made {{for the first time}} with <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> 8. 3. The work was conducted at the NOAA Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) in Boulder, Colorado, and at the research and instrument manufacturing facility of the Ball Aerospace System Division located about 2 km east of Boulder. (The SBUV- 2 S/N- 2 instrument, built by Ball Aerospace Systems Division, is scheduled for launch aboard the NOAA- 13 satellite).

It can be concluded from this close correlation between data for the complete range of air mass available, that the filter instrument constructed in this project gives ozone values with an accuracy comparable to that of the <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer.</b> A good correlation was found, in the limited sample of data available, between the daily mean ozone values from the filter instrument and meteorological upper air parameters.

By integrating over the range of altitudes from the surface to the rocket apogee and by appropriately estimating the residual ozone amount from apogee {{to the top of}} the atmosphere, a total ozone amount can be computed from the profiles that can be directly compared with the ground based instrumentation results. <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometers</b> were used for two of the ground-based instruments.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{ozone layer}} is under threat due to warming in the {{troposphere}} {{brought about by}} the increase in greenhouse gases (GHG) concentrations. Warming in the troposphere makes the stratosphere cooler, producing polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) that support chemical reactions that produce active chlorine which destroys ozone. Ozone measurements and analyses with different instrument platforms (satellite-borne and ground-based) must still be performed as they remain essential even with the signing of the Montréal Protocol. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) contributes to the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) Program of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) [2006 - 2013] by measuring daily total ozone column using a <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer.</b> Maximum amount of ozone was observed during the northern hemisphere summer period and minimum throughout the northern hemisphere winter due to unequal solar radiation which is a factor for ozone production. The differences between satellite-borne and ground-based ozone measuring instruments were investigated and it was found out that the measurements vary due to local weather events, solar zenith angle, sky conditions, and the relatively large footprint of the satellites. Comparing the ground-based <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> and the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) instrument on-board the ENVISAT satellite yielded a correlation coefficient and a root-mean-squar...|$|R

If there were no seasonal variation in the stratosphere, the seasonal variation observed in the troposphere alone would be sufficient to drive a total ozone column variation of about 5 percent.

40|$|The <b>Dobson</b> <b>Spectrophotometer</b> is {{the oldest}} {{measuring}} device for TOZ in the atmosphere, developed in 1924 by G. M. B. Dobson (Fig. 1. 1) Today, the observations of TOZ by this instrument {{is one of the}} longest geophysical measurements series in existence (TOZ over Arosa, Switzerland, since 1926).

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the susceptibility of the <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> No. 118 to stray light interference. In this regard, {{a series of}} total ozone content measurements were carried out in Athens, Greece for air-mass values (μ) extending up to μ = 5. The monochromatic-heterochromatic stray light derived by Basher's model was used in order to evaluate the specific instrumental parameters which determine if this instrument suffers from this problem or not. The results obtained indicate that the measurements made by the Dobson instrument of the Athens station for air mass values up to 2. 5, underestimates the total ozone content by 3. 5 DU in average, or about 1 % of the station's mean total ozone content (TOC). The comparison {{of the values of}} the same parameters measured 15 years ago with the present ones indicates the good maintenance of the <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> No. 118. This fact is of crucial importance because the variability of the daily total ozone observations collected by the Athens Dobson Station since 1989 has proved to be representative to the variability of the mean total ozone observed over the whole mid-latitude zone of the Northern Hemisphere. This stresses the point that the Athens total ozone station, being the unique Dobson station in south-eastern Europe, may be assumed as a ground truth station for the reliable conversion of the satellite radiance observations to total ozone measurements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Despite the {{extensive}} investigations {{to understand the}} difference between ground-based and space-borne measurements, there still exist differences in total ozone (TO) measured at those two different platforms. Comparisons were carried {{out for the first time}} between TO data obtaiend from the ground based <b>Dobson</b> and Brewer <b>spectrophotometers,</b> and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on board EOS-Aura satellite in a megacity site in Northeast Asia. The TO values retrieved by the OMI-DOAS (Differential optical absorption spectroscopy) algorithm tend to be lower than those measured by the ground based sensors in spring and summer as well as the low solar zenith angle condition. We found that such underestimation of the OMI-DOAS TO is caused by tropospheric ozone underestimated by the OMI-DOAS algorithm when tropospheric ozone are significantly enhanced.

40|$|Visible {{spectra of}} the zenith-sky were {{recorded}} at Faraday in Antartica (65 °S) during 1990. Line-of-sight ozone amounts were deduced by fitting laboratory cross-sections to the spectra. At the lattitude of Faraday, visible spectra are more useful than the u. v. wavelengths {{used by the}} <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer,</b> because they permit observations of ozone throughout the winter {{when the sun is}} too low in elevation for useful measurements with the Dobson. In order to find the accuracy of the visible-light system for the determination of medium- and long-term trends in ozone, Langley plots of the ozone amounts were examined to determine the stability of the offset to the zero of the ozone measurement. The plots revealed changes which correlated with shifts in wavelength of the spectrometer. This allowed the use of wavelength shift as a surrogate for offset, fortunate because the use of Langley plots to determine the offset on an individual day from zenith-sky spectra at high latitudes is unreliable. The standard deviation of the ratios of total ozone measured on the same day at Faraday by the <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> and the visible spectrometer was 10 % using offsets calculated from wavelength shifts. This is 4 % less than the standard deviation using a straight-line fit to the offsets. Although common for Dobson measurements of ozone in the u. v., such Langley-plot analyses are, so far, unusual for visible spectrometers, but are essential for future trend determination, even by systems that are inherently more stable...|$|R

50|$|<b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometers</b> {{can be used}} {{to measure}} both total column ozone and {{profiles}} of ozone in the atmosphere. Ozone is tri-atomic oxygen, O3; ozone molecules absorb harmful UV light in the atmosphere before it reaches the surface of the earth. No UVC radiation penetrates to the ground as it is absorbed in the ozone-oxygen cycle. However some longer-wave and less harmful UVB and most of the UVA is not absorbed as ozone is less opaque to these frequencies, so they penetrate to the ground level of Earth in higher quantities. The sources of light used may vary. Beside the direct sun light, the light from the clear sky, moon or stars may be used.|$|R
