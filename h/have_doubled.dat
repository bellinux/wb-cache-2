5|$|The Nova Scotia Government had {{originally}} proposed minor repairs for the structure, but {{they decided that}} a new bridge would be more cost-effective. Unlike the old bridge, the new bridge was designed without overhead steel arches that would <b>have</b> <b>doubled</b> the cost. It {{was built on the}} same site as the old bridge's predecessor, which was constructed in 1907.|$|E
5|$|To unify all weight systems used by apothecaries, the Irish pharmacopœia of 1850 {{introduced}} a new variant of the apothecaries' system which subdivided a new apothecaries' pound of 12 avoirdupois ounces instead of the troy pound. To allow effective use of the new system, new weight pieces were produced. Since an avoirdupois ounce corresponds to 28.35g, the proposed system was {{very similar to that}} in use in Portugal and Spain, and in some locations in Italy. But it would <b>have</b> <b>doubled</b> the value of the avoirdupois drachm (an existing unit, but by then only used for weighing silk). Therefore, it conflicted with other non-standard variations that were based on that nearly obsolete unit.|$|E
5|$|Required {{to tender}} {{by the end}} of April 1947, work began on receipt of Specification B.35/46 at Avro, led by {{technical}} director Roy Chadwick and chief designer Stuart Davies; the type designation was Avro 698. It was obvious to the design team that conventional aircraft could not satisfy the specification; knowing little about high-speed flight and unable to glean much from the Royal Aircraft Establishment or the US, they investigated German Second World War swept wing research. The team estimated that an otherwise conventional aircraft, with a swept wing of 45°, would <b>have</b> <b>doubled</b> the weight requirement. Realising that swept wings increase longitudinal stability, the team deleted the tail (empennage) and the supporting fuselage, it thus became a swept-back flying wing with only a rudimentary forward fuselage and a fin (vertical stabilizer) at each wingtip. The estimated weight was now only 50% over the requirement; a delta shape resulted from reducing the wingspan and maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips, which enabled the specification to be met. Though Alexander Lippisch is generally credited as the pioneer of the delta wing, Chadwick's team had followed its own logical design process. The initial design submission had four large turbojets stacked in pairs buried in the wing either side of the centreline. Outboard of the engines were two bomb-bays.|$|E

50|$|Rewari {{is a major}} {{junction}} on the Indian railway network. It has {{connections to}} major cities in India by direct trains and is a major freight transit station. Therefore, Ahmedabad-Rewari-Ludhiana trunk route is being doubled to cater to ever increasing containerised freight trains. The Delhi-Rewari railway line <b>had</b> <b>double</b> metre gauge track earlier; now it <b>has</b> <b>double</b> broad gauge track since 2008. The Rewari-Ajmer railway line via Bandikui and Jaipur <b>has</b> <b>double</b> track since 2011. The doubling of the track from Ajmer to Ahmedabad has been approved and will take a few years for execution.

50|$|A second {{significant}} amendment the OPA {{makes to}} the CWA {{is that it}} makes it a mandatory requirement for U.S. tank vessels, onshore and offshore facilities to establish and submit oil spill response plans to the corresponding federal authority. The OPA requires new vessels operating and transporting oil in U.S. waters to <b>have</b> <b>double</b> hulls. Not all vessels are of the same size and for the same purpose hence the OPA makes provision for exempting certain vessels from <b>having</b> <b>double</b> hulls. However, by 2015 it is a requirement by law that all oil carrying vessels operating in the U.S. must <b>have</b> <b>double</b> hulls.|$|R

25|$|Human {{population}} {{is not very}} dense in the Rocky Mountains, {{with an average of}} four people per square kilometer and few cities with over 50,000 people. However, the human population grew rapidly in the Rocky Mountain states between 1950 and 1990. The 40-year statewide increases in population range from 35% in Montana to about 150% in Utah and Colorado. The populations of several mountain towns and communities <b>have</b> <b>doubled</b> in the last 40 years. Jackson Hole, Wyoming, increased 260%, from 1,244 to 4,472 residents, in 40 years.|$|E

He claimed tensions would worsen because the nonwhite population was growing: whereas in Lambeth it was 25%, of those of secondary school age it was 40%. Powell said that the government should be honest to the people by telling them in thirty years' time, the black population of Lambeth would <b>have</b> <b>doubled</b> in size.|$|E

In 1854 there was no institution of learning; to-day we have a flourishing college and a diocesan seminary, an academy for young ladies, a boarding school for boys, and parish schools attached to almost all the parishes.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, {{an ambitious}} plan {{was drawn to}} {{overhaul}} the city's storm water drainage system which had never been reviewed in over 50 years. A project costing approximately 6billion rupees was proposed by UK based consultants hired by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to study the matter. Implementation of the project would have ensured that rainwater did not flood the streets of Mumbai. The project was planned to have completed by 2002 and aimed to enhance the drainage system through larger diameter storm water drains and pipes, using pumps wherever necessary and removing encroachments. The project, if implemented would <b>have</b> <b>doubled</b> the storm water carrying capacity to 50mm per hour.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 report jointly {{issued by}} aid {{organizations}} Save the Children and Britain's Medical Aid for Palestinians found that 10 percent of Gaza children under five had stunted growth due to malnutrition and that 68 percent of pre-school children and 58 {{percent of children}} of school age suffered from anaemia. The report stated that the five-year blockade of Gaza Strip, which has prevented importation of necessary supplies and materials, as well as Israel's Gaza War bombing of infrastructure, has led to water being severely contaminated by fertilizer and human waste. Diseases like typhoid and diarrhea, spread by contaminated water, <b>have</b> <b>doubled</b> in {{children under the age}} of 3, which has long-term health implications.
