Bobby Hull was barred from playing, as was any other player who {{signed a contract with}} the rival league, which was a heavily criticized move. [...] Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau sent a telegram to NHL president Clarence Campbell, expressing his [...] "intense interest which <b>I</b> <b>share</b> with millions of Canadians ... that Canada should be represented by its best hockey players, including Bobby Hull". Echoing the feelings of the public, Hull called the decision [...] "crazy", and stated that [...] "I'm a Canadian and I want to play for my country.

500|$|In the new year, O'Sullivan {{returned}} to the Masters as the defending champion. He defeated Liang Wenbo 6–5 in a dramatic first-round match. In the tenth frame, Liang missed the final black in a clearance which would have given him victory. After potting the black, O'Sullivan went on to produce a break of 121 in the deciding frame to win the match. O'Sullivan then beat Neil Robertson 6–3 in the quarter-finals, and Marco Fu 6–4 in the semi-finals to reach his twelfth Masters final despite problems with his cue tip. In the final, he defeated Joe Perry 10–7 to win his seventh Masters title, setting {{the record for the}} most number of title wins at the tournament. After the tournament, O'Sullivan received a disciplinary letter from World Snooker over comments he made to the press after his match with Fu. He criticised referee Terry Camilleri's performance and a photographer during post-match interviews. This led to O'Sullivan stating that he would no longer give in-depth answers in interviews or press conferences, claiming [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>share</b> my thoughts, I risk being fined".|$|E

The same day, Spears uploaded {{a picture of the}} cover art to her Twitter account. Kesha told MTV News, [...] "I'm a massive fan of both the ladies <b>I</b> <b>share</b> the track with. I wrote 'TTWE' for Britney [...] and she killed it and I loved it, but I just thought a supergroup of three hot, strong women could just take over the airwaves." [...] The remix adds heavier bass during the beginning, and starts with Minaj rapping with intensity about a female hater, in lines such as [...] "Told you they'd revive your career, but somebody lied/ I ain't talkin' poultry when I say this chicken's fried." [...] This continues by Spears singing the first verse, after which Minaj says [...] "It's Britney, bitch. I'm Nicki Minaj and that's Kesha!", and the first chorus is sung by the latter. Spears continues with the song and is accompanied by Kesha {{towards the end of the}} second verse and the bridge. The remix also features a dubstep breakdown, reminiscent of [...] "Hold It Against Me".|$|E

2500|$|Elsie's biggest success came in {{creating}} the title role in the English-language version of The Merry Widow in the London production. Edwardes took Elsie to see the original German version (Die Lustige Witwe) in Berlin. Elsie was at first reluctant {{to take on the}} demanding part, thinking her voice too light for the role, but Edwardes persuaded her to accept. [...] Edwardes brought her to see the famous designer, Lucile, for a style coaching. [...] Lucile later wrote, [...] "I realised that here was a girl who had both beauty and intelligence but who had never learnt how {{to make the best of}} herself. So shy and diffident was she in those days that a less astute producer than George Edwardes would in all probability have passed her over and left her in the chorus." [...] The production, with English lyrics by Adrian Ross, opened in June 1907 and ran for 778 performances at Daly's Theatre. Elsie created the role at Daly's and toured with it beginning in August 1908. The show was an enormous success for its creators and made Elsie a major star. One critic at the opening night praised [...] "the youthfulness, the dainty charm and grace, the prettiness and the exquisite dancing with which Miss Elsie invests the part.... <b>I</b> <b>share</b> the opinion of most of the first-nighters, who considered it could not have been in better hands, and could not have been better handled....

[...] "The whole situation {{is one that is}} very serious indeed", and reported after the speech, [...] "the audience was tumultuous in its applause and so carried away that it seemed to almost trample over Mrs. McKenzie and me after the address." [...] McKenzie acknowledged that [...] "the dominant view of the colored people today is more or less sympathetic with Dr. Du Bois on the race issue," [...] and conceded that today [...] "nothing is so popular with colored audiences as denunciation of the whites, and nothing so unpopular as its absence." [...] But McKenzie refuted Du Bois' accusations that were [...] "not more than partially true." [...] He learned that at the first of the two concerts [...] "the manager of the Auditorium helped in the sale of tickets and not very tactfully turned the colored people to one window, her object being to get two streams of people in accordance with their destination. This matter was brought to my attention that night by one of our alumni and the situation was changed the next morning." [...] He further noted that [...] "we recently widened the amount of space allowed the colored people, so much so that at the last concert, in May, hundreds of white people overflowed into the colored section, mingling indiscriminately with the colored people." [...] Shortly after Du Bois's speech, Fisk trustees drafted a formal letter vigorously supporting the policies McKenzie pursued at Fisk." [...] However, Fisk trustee William DeBerry, the Black leader of St. John's Congregational Church in Springfield, Massachusetts, one of the largest Black Congregational churches in the United States, refused to sign the letter. DeBerry told Wood, [...] "I must confess that <b>I</b> <b>share</b> to some extent with many others of the Fisk alumni in a grave anxiety and fear as to the ultimate outcome of what they consider an ultra conciliatory attitude on the part of Dr. McKenzie toward southern sentiment as regards the Negro problem." [...] "I do not agree with Dr. Du Bois in all he is reported to have said in his recent address at Fisk, nor do I approve of the maneuver in which attack on Dr. McKenzie was made." ...|$|E
