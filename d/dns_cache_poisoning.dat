40|$|Abstract—ARP <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> based attack {{has been}} one of the most {{successful}} attack methods for years inside a LAN. There are a few solutions to detect and sometimes prevent an ARP based attack but they have some restrictions. In this paper we present a novel way to detect ARP <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> inside a LAN. We propose a middleware and synchronous solution that has to be implemented in a distributed approach. Our solution requires no need have access and change to any Operating System code, but needs to be activated in timely manner and more than one host inside a LAN will be utilized to detect ARP <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> based attack...|$|R

30|$|Our main {{message in}} this work is that domain name system {{security}} extensions (DNSSEC) is the most suitable defence for DNS against <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> attacks. As we show, the significance of DNSSEC is not only in preventing <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> (and thus other advanced) attacks but also {{in its ability to}} enable detection of attacks a posteriori. In fact, DNSSEC is the only mechanism that facilitates forensic analysis of attacks and provides evidences, which can be presented to third parties and which allow detection of attacks even by very strong adveraries, such as goverment agencies.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) {{and the problem}} of ARP <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning.</b> ARP <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> is the malicious act, by a host in a LAN, of introducing a spurious IP address to MAC (Ethernet) address mapping in another host’s ARP cache. We discuss design constraints for a solution: the solution needs to be implemented in middleware, without access or change to any operating system source code, be backward-compatible to the existing protocol, and be asynchronous. We present our solution and implementation aspects of it in a Streams based networking subsystem. Our solution can be implemented in non-Streams based networking subsystems also. Our solution comprises two parts: a "bump in the stack " Streams module, and a separate Stream with a driver and user-level application. We also present the algorithm that is executed in the module and application to prevent ARP <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> where possible and detect and raise alarms otherwise. We then discuss some limitations with our approach and present some preliminary performance numbers for our implementation. 1...|$|R

30|$|Due to the {{critical}} function that DNS fulfills, it is highly reactive to new threats and attacks, constantly responding with new defence mechanisms. In particular, to mitigate the detrimental damages of <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> attacks, IETF designed and standardised a cryptographic defence for DNSSEC [RFC 4033 -RFC 4035]. DNSSEC was designed to address the <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> vulnerability in DNS by providing data integrity and origin authenticity via cryptographic digital signatures over DNS resource records. The digital signatures enable the recipient, e.g., resolver, that supports DNSSEC validation, to check that the data in a DNS response {{is the same as}} the data published within the target zone.|$|R
30|$|Philip [12] {{proposed}} {{an approach to}} prevent ARP <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> in wireless LAN by implementing the defense mechanism in the AP. The basic idea is as follows. The AP constructs the list of correct IP-to-MAC address mapping by monitoring DHCP ACK messages or referring to the DHCP leases file, and blocks all the ARP packets with a false mapping based on the constructed list. However, this approach can be applied only to the dynamic IP addresses allocated through DHCP, and cannot prevent ARP <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> occurring inside the wired LAN. We attempt to protect the upgraded nodes from ARP poisoning-based MITM attacks, whether those nodes are connected to LAN through wire or wireless medium.|$|R

50|$|DNS spoofing, also {{referred}} to as <b>DNS</b> <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning,</b> is a form of computer security hacking in which corrupt Domain Name System data is introduced into the DNS resolver's cache, causing the name server to return an incorrect IP address. This results in traffic being diverted to the attacker's computer (or any other computer).|$|E
50|$|HTTP {{response}} splitting {{is a form}} of {{web application}} vulnerability, resulting from the failure of the application or its environment to properly sanitize input values.

25|$|In July 2008, the CERT Coordination Center {{announced}} that Kaminsky {{had discovered a}} fundamental flaw in the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol. The flaw could allow attackers to easily perform <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> attacks on most nameservers (djbdns, PowerDNS, MaraDNS, Secure64 and Unbound were not vulnerable).|$|R
40|$|The {{threats of}} caching {{poisoning}} attacks largely stimulate {{the deployment of}} DNSSEC. Being a strong but demanding cryptographical defense, DNSSEC has its universal adoption predicted {{to go through a}} lengthy transition. Thus the DNSSEC practitioners call for a secure yet lightweight solution to speed up DNSSEC deployment while offering an acceptable DNSSEC-like defense. This paper proposes a new defense against <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> attacks, still using but lightly using DNSSEC. In the solution, DNS operates in the DNSSEC-oblivious mode unless a potential attack is detected and triggers a switch to the DNSSEC-aware mode. The performance of the defense is analyzed and validated. The modeling checking results demonstrate that only a small DNSSEC query load is needed to ensure a small enough <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> success rate...|$|R

5000|$|A {{subsystem}} of the Golden Shield {{has been}} nicknamed [...] "the Great Firewall" [...] (防火长城) (a term that {{first appeared in}} a Wired magazine article in 1997) in reference to {{its role as a}} network firewall and to the ancient Great Wall of China. This part of the project includes the ability to block content by preventing IP addresses from being routed through and consists of standard firewalls and proxy servers at the six Internet gateways. The system also selectively engages in <b>DNS</b> <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> when particular sites are requested. The government {{does not appear to be}} systematically examining Internet content, as this appears to be technically impractical. Because of its disconnection from the larger world of IP routing protocols, the network contained within the Great Firewall has been described as [...] "the Chinese autonomous routing domain".|$|E
30|$|As {{explained}} in Section 1, neglecting unsolicited ARP replies cannot prevent ARP <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning,</b> since ARP requests {{can be easily}} induced by source address-spoofed ICMP echo request messages. If the member nodes of a given subnet do not change frequently, then the ARP <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> might be avoided by employing static ARP. However, this approach may be infeasible {{in an environment where}} the IP addresses are allocated to mobile nodes dynamically through Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). DAI corresponds to the approach that requires the support of ethernet switches [8]. In the DAI, the ethernet switch checks the validity of the received ARP packet based on the trusted IP-to-MAC mapping database. However, this database is either manually managed or dynamically managed through DHCP snooping [8]. In order to perform DHCP snooping, the port on which the network DHCP server is connected needs to be configured as a trusted interface, and other ports need to be configured as untrusted interfaces. However, this approach may not be effective, if the ARP <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> occurs among the wireless nodes connected via the same AP. In this article, we attempt to devise a method to prevent ARP poisoning-based MITM attacks with minimal overhead of manual configuration by the network administrator or by the user, and with minimal infrastructure upgrade cost.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: ARP <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> {{and putting}} host Network Interface Card (NIC) in {{promiscuous}} mode are ways of sniffer attacks. ARP <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> attack {{is effective in}} an environment which is not broadcast in nature (like switch LAN environment) and other attack is effective in an environment which is broadcast in nature (like hub, bus, access point LAN environments). Sniffing is malicious activity performed by network user {{and because of this}} network security is at risk so detection of sniffer is essential task to maintain network security. Sniffer detection techniques can be divided into two main categories. First category’s techniques are used to detect a sniffer host that runs it’s NIC into promiscuous mode and second category’s techniques are used to detect a sniffer host that uses ARP <b>cache</b> <b>poisoning</b> for sniffing. The network configuration is hidden form users. Network users do not have any information about nature of network. Therefore, users of network may invoke such sniffer detection technique that is not effective in that environment. This may result in sharing of his private and confidential information with malicious users. In this paper, we designed an intelligent invocation module that checks the nature of environment automatically and invokes appropriate, sniffer detection technique for that environment. With the help of this invocation module it is possible to detect passive as well as active sniffer hosts in both environments...|$|R
