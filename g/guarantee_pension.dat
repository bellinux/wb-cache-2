40|$|In {{accordance}} with the act on the national pension index, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health is to commission {{an evaluation of the}} adequacy of basic social security every four years. An independent expert group is to be appointed for the task and to carry out the assessment autonomously. In April 2014, commissioned by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, the National Institute for Health and Welfare convened the second expert group for evaluation of the adequacy of basic social security, and to conduct the second evaluation of its kind. The second expert group decided to conduct the evaluation by applying the same basic solutions as the first evaluation group did but developed and intensified the evaluation in several aspects. The second evaluation examines the development of the adequacy of basic social security and the factors affecting it from 2011 to 2015. The model family calculations applied in the evaluation have been generated with the new SISU microsimulation model of Statistics Finland. As a rule, the disposable income of households depending on basic benefits (or on low wages) increased between 2011 and 2015, in relation to average wage-earners and in real terms, both before and after dwelling costs. However, during the same period, the real wages of an average-earning household remained essentially at the same level. Persons living alone in rental dwellings and receiving the basic benefits are calculatedly entitled to means-tested basic social assistance. Their income level is determined according to the level of basic means-tested social assistance, and amounts to 43 per cent of the income level of average earners living alone. As the level of <b>guarantee</b> <b>pension</b> is higher than the other benefits, the estimated entitlement to means-tested social assistance is not realised. The income level of single-dweller <b>guarantee</b> <b>pension</b> recipients is 48 per cent of the income level of average earners. In Finland, the income level guaranteed by basic social security is in line with the average level in Western Europe, both before and after housing costs. With the exception of pensioners, the income level of persons relying on basic social security is not adequate to cover reasonable minimum costs determined in reference budgets. In 2014, the income level of unemployed persons, students or sickness allowance recipients living alone in rental housing was enough to cover 71 per cent of reasonable minimum costs. The respective figure for <b>guarantee</b> <b>pension</b> recipients was 102 per cent. The income level of persons on basic social security has increased since 2011 compared with the reference budgets of reasonable minimum costs. Their income level proves to be inadequate when compared with the level deemed adequate by the general public. It amounted to 66 per cent of the monetary sum deemed adequate. The income level of persons on <b>guarantee</b> <b>pension</b> amounted to 85 per cent of the level that the Finnish general public regarded adequate for living. The total number of people living in households completely dependent on basic social security—basic benefits, housing allowances and means-tested social assistance—totalled 231, 000 or 4. 3 per cent of the Finnish population in 2013. The number has increased since 2011. The average duration of total dependence on basic security is four years on average. A total of 71 per cent of households on basic social security benefits are at risk of poverty (the respective percentage for the total population is 13), and 54 per cent report their income to be inadequate (respectively, 25 per cent of the total population). When monitoring the benefits administrated by the Finnish Social Insurance Institution (Kela), the majority, or 64 per cent, of basic benefit recipients are women. Meanwhile, 61 per cent of general housing allowance recipients living alone are men. Further, of all recipients of means-tested social assistance 53 per cent are men. Reforms in benefit and tax legislation during 2011 – 2015 have decreased the Gini coefficient used to measure the income gap by approximately 0. 8 percentage points, and the relative poverty risk by approximately 1. 4 percentage points. Due to legislative amendments, the share of unemployed persons in unemployment traps has increased. Furthermore, the participation tax rate has increased, both regarding the transition from unemployment to full-time work and from part-time to full-time work. 143 pp. Originally published as Perusturvan riittävyyden arviointiraportti 2011 – 2015.

The current tendency is the exibility and an interesting extent of this evolution is the introduction of a variable minimum <b>guarantee.</b> <b>Pension</b> funds are private pension structures organized through two main schemes: de 8 ̆ 5 ned contribution (DC) and de 8 ̆ 5 ned bene 8 ̆ 5 t (DB). The two schemes can be arranged to customize more complex needs, for example the targeted money purchase (TMP) in which is guaranteed a minimum pension payment plus any upside potential {{in the value of the}} fund assets that exceeds the target level. Set L the liability level and A the underlying assets, at the retirement date the present value of the TPM pension scheme is: TMP = A+ P = max (A;L) = max (DC;DB) = C + L (1) where P and C are european, respectively, put and call written on the assets A, with the same exercise price L. Index and Unit linked insurance products provide their customers with the performance realized to the underlying 8 ̆ 5 nancial index or unit of an inter-nal/external mutual fund. In traditional insurance practice the 8 ̆ 5 nancial risk is completely charged on the insurer, nowadays the modern tendency consists of recognizing a minimum guarantee.

40|$|In 2003 the Swedish {{parliament}} {{decided to}} incorporate maintenance {{support for the}} elderly {{within the framework of}} the state social insurance system. Maintenance support for the elderly entails that individuals who, due to too short a period of residence in Sweden, do not qualify themselves for a full <b>guarantee</b> <b>pension</b> and thus have the right to receive benefits after completion of an income test. A large proportion of these people previously received individually incometested social benefits. Maintenance support for the elderly and how it is perceived by the elderly is the focus of the study. The overall aim of the study is to gain knowledge about what it means for immigrants who moved in later life to be the subject of a transfer from a selective benefit system to one where more general principles apply. More specifically the aim concerns what it means for their possibilities for gaining access to social rights and what it means for their relationship with the Swedish welfare state. The study’s empirical material consists of two parts. The first part contains register data from the social services register of the National Board of Health and Social Welfare and the social insurance register of the Swedish Social Insurance Board. The second consists of interviews with eleven foreign-born elderly persons who previously received social benefits and now receive maintenance support for the elderly. The analysis of the register data indicates that one-fifth of the target group actually includes people born in Sweden while the rest are immigrants arriving in Sweden in later life. For most of those in this latter group the maintenance support is their only source of financial support while it is a supplement for the Swedish-born elderly recipients. The results show that of those, who previously received social benefits and where the maintenance support is their only source of financial support, about onefifth received a smaller amount of benefit after the reform. The interview study indicates the existence of a gap between what the respondents express as needs of more individual considerations both in terms of the contact with the administrating authority and the maintenance support’s monetary content and how the elderly perceive that these needs are provided for. In order to try to understand this gap the result was analysed by using a number of major theoretical concepts such as universalism, stigma and shame, and social citizenship, public identity and recognition. The conclusions of the study is that a comprehension of the gap can be found in the standardised design and administration of the maintenance support and in the socio-economic context that immigrants coming to Sweden in later life find themselves in...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{begins with}} the issue of pension security, {{referencing}} the desired predictability, stability, long-lived nature of benefits, and coverage of retirement incomes. Also considered is the issue of pension security in the light of global financial market performance and integration. Having discussed issues of nation-state fiscal capacity and the consequences of the technology, media, and telecommunications speculative bubble for stock market returns it is suggested that pension security is also a matter of institutional integrity. This is illustrated with reference to debate in US Congress over the proper response to the Enron debacle. It is argued that no public or private institutions (including the nation-state and large corporations) can now guarantee the final value of pension benefits. As the baby boom generation comes to retirement across the Western world, pension security in the form of <b>guaranteed</b> <b>pension</b> benefit value is a hollow ideal; a chimera on the horizon of nation-state politics that cannot be sustained, notwithstanding the commitment of many to social justice and social solidarity between the generations. ...|$|R
