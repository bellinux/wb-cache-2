Citing the EPA as its source, the California Department of Pesticide Regulation concluded, “Over the past century, only 11 incidents of <b>iodomethane</b> poisoning {{have been reported in}} the published literature.” (Hermouet, C. et al. 1996 & Appel, G.B. et al. 1975) “An updated literature search on May 30, 2007 for <b>iodomethane</b> poisoning produced only one additional case report.” (Schwartz MD, et al. 2005). All but one were industrial—not agricultural—accidents, and the remaining case of poisoning was an apparent suicide. Methyl iodide is routinely and regularly used in industrial processes as well as in most university and college chemistry departments for study and learning related to a variety of organic chemical reactions.|$|E

50|$|Dimethyl carbonate's main benefit {{over other}} methylating {{reagents}} such as <b>iodomethane</b> and dimethyl sulfate is its much lower toxicity and its biodegradability. Unfortunately, it {{is a relatively}} weak methylating agent compared to these traditional reagents.|$|E

50|$|Biomass {{also has}} the {{potential}} to be converted to multiple commodity chemicals. Halomethanes have successfully been by produced using a combination of A. fermentans and engineered S. cerevisiae. This method converts NaX salts and unprocessed biomass such as switchgrass, sugarcane, corn stover, or poplar into halomethanes. S-adenosylmethionine which is naturally occurring in S. cerevisiae allows a methyl group to be transferred. Production levels of 150 mg L-1H-1 <b>iodomethane</b> were achieved. At these levels roughly 173000 L of capacity would need to be operated just to replace the United States’ need for <b>iodomethane.</b> However, an advantage of this method is that it uses NaI rather than I2; NaI is significantly less hazardous than I2. This method may be applied to produce ethylene in the future.|$|E

5000|$|If the enthalpies of {{formation}} {{of two of}} the three species are known, the third can be calculated {{with the help of the}} dissociative photoionization energy, E0, using Hess's law. This approach was used, for instance, to determine the enthalpy of {{formation of}} the methyl ion, , which in turn was used to obtain the enthalpy of formation of <b>iodomethane,</b> [...] as 15.23 kJ mol−1, with an uncertainty of only 0.3 kJ mol−1.|$|E
50|$|Methylations are {{commonly}} performed using electrophilic methyl {{sources such as}} <b>iodomethane,</b> dimethyl sulfate, dimethyl carbonate, or tetramethylammonium chloride. Less common but more powerful (and more dangerous) methylating reagents include methyl triflate, diazomethane, and methyl fluorosulfonate (magic methyl). These reagents all react via SN2 nucleophilic substitutions. For example, a carboxylate may be methylated on oxygen to give a methyl ester; an alkoxide salt RO− may be likewise methylated to give an ether, ROCH3; or a ketone enolate may be methylated on carbon to produce a new ketone.|$|E
5000|$|Photofragment ion imaging or, more generally, Product Imaging is an {{experimental}} technique for making {{measurements of the}} velocity of product molecules or particles following a chemical reaction or the photodissociation of a parent molecule. [...] The method uses a two-dimensional detector, usually a microchannel plate, to record the arrival positions of state-selected ions created by resonantly enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI).

5000|$|Studies on Vaska's complex helped {{provide the}} {{conceptual}} framework for homogeneous catalysis. Vaska's complex, with 16 valence electrons, is considered [...] "coordinatively unsaturated" [...] and can thus bind to one two-electron or two one-electron ligands to become electronically saturated with 18 valence electrons. The addition of two one-electron ligands is called oxidative addition. Upon oxidative addition, the oxidation state of the iridium increases from Ir(I) to Ir(III). The four-coordinated square planar arrangement in the starting complex converts to an octahedral, six-coordinate product. Vaska's complex undergoes oxidative addition with conventional oxidants such as halogens, strong acids such as HCl, and other molecules known to react as electrophiles, such as <b>iodomethane</b> (CH3I).|$|E
50|$|Since P. ramorum can {{persist for}} an {{undetermined}} {{period of time}} within the soil profile, management programs in nurseries should also deal with delineating the pathogen’s distribution in nursery soil and eliminating it from infested areas. A variety of chemical options has been tested for soil disinfestation, including such chemicals as chloropicrin, metham sodium, <b>iodomethane,</b> and dazomet. Lab tests indicated {{that all of these}} chemicals were effective when applied to infested soil in glass jars. Additionally, tests on volunteer nurseries with infested soil demonstrated that dazomet (trade name Basamid) fumigation followed by a 14-day tarping period successfully removed P. ramorum from the soil profile. Other soil disinfestation practices under investigation, or in which interest has been expressed, include steam sterilization, solarization, and paving of infested areas.|$|E

In the cases of N-substituted pyrroles, metalation of the carbons is more facile. Alkyl groups can be introduced as electrophiles, or by cross-coupling reactions. Substitution at C3 can be achieved through the use of N-substituted 3-bromopyrrole, which can be synthesized by bromination of N-silylpyrrole with NBS.|$|E
5000|$|Methyl nitrite can be {{prepared}} by the reaction of silver nitrite with iodomethane: Silver nitrite (AgNO2) exists in solution as the silver ion, Ag+ and the nitrite ion, NO2−. One of the lone pairs on an oxygen from nitrite ion attacks the methyl group (—CH3), releasing the iodide ion into solution. [...] Unlike silver nitrite, silver iodide is highly insoluble in water and thus forms a solid. [...] Note that nitrogen is a better nucleophile than oxygen and most nitrites would react via an SN2-like mechanism and the major product would be nitromethane. For example, sodium and potassium nitrite reacting with <b>iodomethane</b> would produce mostly nitromethane, with methyl nitrite as the minor product. However, {{the presence of the}} silver ion in solution has a stabilizing effect on the formation of carbocation intermediates, increasing the percent yield of methyl nitrite. In either case, some nitromethane and methyl nitrite are both formed.|$|E
50|$|Huttonite {{was first}} {{described}} in 1950 from beach sand and fluvio-glacial deposits in South Westland, New Zealand, {{where it was}} found as anhedral grains {{of no more than}} 0.2 mm maximum dimension. It is most prevalent in the sand at Gillespie's Beach, near Fox Glacier, which is the type location, where it is accompanied by scheelite, cassiterite, zircon, uranothorite, ilmenite and gold. It was found at a further six nearby locations in less plentiful amounts. Huttonite was extracted from the sands by first fractionating in <b>iodomethane</b> and then electromagnetically. Pure samples were subsequently obtained by handpicking huttonite grains under a microscope. This was accomplished either in the presence of short wave (2540 Å) fluorescent light, where the dull white fluorescence distinguishes it from scheelite (fluoresces blue) and zircon (fluoresces yellow), or by first boiling the impure sample in hydrochloric acid to induce an oxide surface on scheelite and permitting handpicking under visible light.|$|E
