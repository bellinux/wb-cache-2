5|$|As {{the month}} of August begins, special stalls, fun fairs and shops are set up across the country <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> of {{national}} flags, buntings, banners and posters, badges, pictures of national heroes, multimedia and other celebratory items. Vehicles, private buildings, homes, and streets are decorated with national flags, candles, oil lamps, pennants and buntings.

5|$|Brownhills {{holds an}} annual canal festival in June with stalls, {{entertainment}} and boat trips, {{and there is}} an active Community Association which organises a range of events, including a weekend-long military display event in 2006. The town has a weekly market which is popular but suffers from a reputation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> of counterfeit goods. In 2005 Trading Standards officers seized over £40,000 worth of fake goods in a raid on the market.|$|E
5|$|A deal <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> of Constitution Center {{was agreed}} to in December 2012. MetLife and an {{unidentified}} investor (represented by Clarion Partners LLC) each purchased a 50 percent {{interest in the}} building. The sale price was $734 million, or $524 per square foot (0.093 square meters). The sale price was the most expensive in D.C. history for a single building. (It was not the most paid per square foot, however. That record went to two-building Market Square at 701 and 801 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, which sold in 2011 to Wells Real Estate Investment Trust for $905 per square foot.) When the deal closed in February 2013, David Nassif Associates announces it would wind down its operations and liquidate its remaining obligations.|$|E

5|$|As {{the chief}} {{parliamentary}} spokesman for an abandoned policy, Calvert no longer served a useful purpose to the English Royal Court, and by February 1624 his duties had been restricted to placating the Spanish ambassador. The degree of his disfavour was shown {{when he was}} reprimanded for supposedly delaying diplomatic letters. Calvert bowed to the inevitable. On the pretext of ill health, he began negotiations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> of his position, finally resigning the secretariat in February 1625.|$|E
5|$|Bakaara Market {{was created}} in late 1972 by the Barre administration. It served as an open market <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> of goods and services, {{including}} produce and clothing. After {{the start of the}} civil war, the market was controlled by various militant groups, who used it as a base for their operations. Following Mogadishu's pacification in 2011, renovations resumed at the market. Shops were rehabilitated, selling everything from fruit and garments to building materials. As {{in the rest of the}} city, Barkaara Market's real estate values have also risen considerably. , the local Tabaarak firm was renting out a newly constructed warehouse at the market for $2,000 per month.|$|E
5|$|Following {{an effort}} from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many maple syrup {{producer}} associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding {{the classification of}} maple syrup to be uniform. Whereas in the past each state or province had their own laws on the classification of maple syrup, now those laws define a unified grading system. This had been {{a work in progress}} for several years, and most of the finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced in the Canada Gazette on 28 June 2014 that rules <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> of maple syrup would be amended to include new descriptors, {{at the request of the}} IMSI.|$|E

5|$|Hawkins benefited {{greatly from}} the public's {{reaction}} to the dinosaurs, which was so strong it allowed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> of sets of small versions of the dinosaur models, priced at £30 for educational use. But {{the building of the}} models was costly (having cost around £13,729) and in 1855, the Crystal Palace Company cut Hawkins's funding. Several planned models were never made, while those half finished were scrapped, despite protest from sources including the Sunday newspaper, The Observer.|$|E

The article {{goes on to say}} that deliveries are likely to begin in 2017.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Argentina {{approached}} the UK {{with a proposal}} to buy a number of Vulcans. An application, made in September 1981, requested the 'early availability' of a 'suitable aircraft'. With some reluctance, ministers approved the export of a single aircraft but emphasised that clearance had not been given <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> of a larger number. A letter from the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office to the Ministry of Defence in January 1982 stated that little prospect was seen of this happening without ascertaining the Argentine interest and whether such interest was genuine: 'On the face of it, a strike aircraft would be entirely suitable for {{an attack on the}} Falklands.' Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands less than three months later.|$|E

The card ultimately sold for $2,105,770.50, including the buyer's premium, a record price for a baseball card in a public auction.|$|E
5|$|Nigel Kneale was a BBC {{employee}} at the time, {{which meant that}} his scripts were owned entirely by the BBC and he received no extra payment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> of the film rights.

Despite this Kneale remained bitter over the affair until the BBC made an ex-gratia payment of £3,000 to him in 1967, in recognition of his creation of Quatermass.|$|E

5|$|Special permits {{exist to}} allow <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> of {{alcoholic}} beverages at golf courses, government-owned facilities, and at social events run by non-profit organizations (for example, church carnivals). A restaurant in New Jersey without a liquor license can sell wine from a New Jersey winery by becoming an offsite retail sales outlet of the winery. Since the early 1990s, {{there have been}} a handful of unsuccessful proposals to create a separate restaurant license allowing eating establishments to sell beer and wine. Such proposals have been strongly opposed by current retail license holders who believe that it would decrease their income, and thus the value of their liquor license.|$|E
5|$|The Vajpayee {{government}} {{ordered the}} Indian {{armed forces to}} expel the Pakistani soldiers occupying Kashmir territory, later known as the Kargil War. Although the government was later criticised for the intelligence failures that did not detect Pakistani presence, it was successful in ousting them from the previously Indian-controlled territory. The Vajpayee administration also offered political support to the US War on Terror, {{in the hope of}} better addressing India's issues with terrorism and insurgency in Kashmir. This led to closer defence ties with the US, including negotiations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> of weapons.|$|E

5|$|The few {{courts that}} have {{considered}} the antitrust implications of concurrent use registration have determined {{that it does not}} raise any violation of antitrust laws. Although it is considered a violation of such laws for companies to agree to divide up geographic territories <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> of goods, concurrent use agreements dividing up trademark territories are specifically provided for by Congress. Furthermore, even with such an agreement in place, a company can still sell competing products in the trademark territory of another company, so long as the intruding party sells that product under a different mark.|$|E
5|$|The first {{extension}} of Smithfield's meat market {{took place between}} 1873 and 1876 {{with the construction of}} the Poultry Market immediately west of the Central Market. A rotunda was built at the centre of the old Market Field (now West Smithfield), comprising gardens, a fountain and a ramped carriageway to the station beneath the market building. Further buildings were subsequently added to the market. The General Market, built between 1879 and 1883, was intended to replace the old Farringdon Market located nearby and established <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> of fruit and vegetables when the earlier Fleet Market was cleared to enable the laying out of Farringdon Street between 1826–1830.|$|E
5|$|Bridgwater was {{incorporated}} by charter of Edward IV (1468), confirmed in 1554, 1586, 1629 and 1684. Parliamentary representation as a borough constituency began in 1295 and continued until the Reform Act of 1870, {{when the original}} borough constituency was disenfranchised for corruption. From 4 July 1870 the town {{was incorporated}} within the county constituency of West Somerset. When Parliamentary seats were redistributed for the 1885 general election, a new county division of Bridgwater was created. A variety of markets were granted to the town during the Middle Ages including a Midsummer fair (on 24 June), one {{at the beginning of}} Lent was added in 1468, and one at Michaelmas. The importance of these markets and fairs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> of wool and wine, and later of cloth, declined after medieval times. The shipping trade of the port revived after the construction of the new dock in 1841, and corn and timber have been imported for centuries.|$|E
