50|$|The 40 pin <b>expansion</b> <b>socket</b> {{opened up}} {{the world to the}} UK101. One could attach a dual floppy disk {{controller}} (5.25") and a memory expansion card (40K max) to allow faster and reliable save/load of programs/data.|$|E
50|$|In {{regards to}} video <b>expansion</b> slots, <b>Socket</b> 939 {{systems can be}} found with both AGP slots and PCI-E x16 slots as well.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, a {{group of}} hobbyists at the 68k Mac Liberation Army forums {{produced}} an <b>expansion</b> card with <b>sockets</b> for an FPU and a bootable, rewriteable ROM.|$|R
5000|$|The userspace {{command-line}} utility [...] inspects this data. Information {{provided by}} this utility typically includes the system manufacturer, model name, serial number, BIOS version and asset tag, as well other details of {{varying level of}} interest and reliability, depending on the system manufacturer. The information often includes usage status for the CPU <b>sockets,</b> <b>expansion</b> slots (including AGP, PCI and ISA) and memory module slots, and the list of I/O ports (including serial, parallel and USB).|$|R
5000|$|Top Row: INS8154 RAMIO Integrated Circuit (for {{keyboard}} and display), 6502 CPU, 2 × 2114 1024×4 RAM, 2 × 74S571 512×4 PROM, RAM/ROM <b>expansion</b> <b>socket,</b> second INS8154 for peripheral expansion (optional extra with the kit version).|$|E
5000|$|Internally, the new {{motherboard}} {{sported a}} pin connector for an internal modem; however no products ever utilized it. The same memory <b>expansion</b> <b>socket</b> introduced on late-model IIc's was present, {{although it was}} not compatible with memory cards designed for the previous system. The ROM firmware (now labeled revision [...] "5", following in the sequence from the original IIc) remained the same size, as did RAM, meaning the machine continued to ship with only 128 KB of memory.|$|E
5000|$|The third revision, the ImageWriter II/L (1990) as it {{was known}} {{internal}}ly, offered some slight design improvements. The internal power source changed to a switching power supply, reducing the overall weight of the printer by 10 pounds. As {{a result of the}} change, power and serial interface ports were moved from the legs to either ends of the tractor-feed housing. This model also increased the built-in buffer memory to 24K RAM, eliminating the need for the memory-expansion option. The <b>expansion</b> <b>socket</b> was still present for supporting an optional AppleTalk network card.|$|E
50|$|Other ports {{followed}} for the Apple III, Zilog Z-80-based Tandy TRS-80 Model I, Model II, Model III, Model 4, and Sony SMC-70. The TRS-80 Model I and Sony SMC-70 ports {{were the only}} versions of VisiCalc without copy protection. The Sony SMC-70 was the only CP/M version. Most versions were disk-based, but the PET VisiCalc came with a ROM chip that the user had to install {{in one of the}} motherboard's <b>expansion</b> ROM <b>sockets.</b> The most important port was for the IBM PC, and VisiCalc {{was one of the first}} commercial packages available when the IBM PC shipped in 1981. It quickly became a best-seller on this platform, in spite of being severely limited to be compatible with the versions from the 8-bit platforms. It is estimated that 300,000 copies were sold on the PC, bringing total sales to about 1 million copies.|$|R
40|$|Rania Assem El Essawy, Sameh Hassan Abdelbaky Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt Purpose: To {{report the}} results of a simple {{outpatient}} method for soft tissue <b>socket</b> <b>expansion</b> in young children with congenital anophthalmos. Methods: Seventeen congenital anophthalmic sockets of 15 infants of a mean age of 4. 2 ± 4. 4  months were fitted with specially designed serial solid acrylic shapes or hydrogel expanders using cyanoacrylate for eyelids closure when using the latter. Results: At the age of 2 years, the mean horizontal eyelid length increased from a mean of 11. 6 ± 4. 5 to 19. 4 ± 4. 6 mm and the volume of the last expander from a mean of 0. 6 ± 0. 2 to 2. 0 ± 0. 3  cm 3. The specially designed acrylic shapes could be a substitute to the custom-made molds, which require general anesthesia. Conclusion: Successful increase in the horizontal eyelid length as well as the conjunctival socket volume could be achieved by a simple outpatient procedure without the need for repeated hospitalization and general anesthesia in these infants.

50|$|A {{wide range}} of {{upgrades}} became available. The PCW 8256's RAM could be expanded to 512 KB for a hardware cost of about £50. An additional internal floppy disk drive for the 8256 would cost about £100, and installation was fairly easy. Alternatively one could add external drives, for example if a 3½-inch drive was needed. Graphical user interface devices such as light pens, mice and graphic tablets could {{be attached to the}} <b>expansion</b> <b>socket</b> {{at the back of the}} monitor. Adding a serial interface connector, which cost about £50, made it possible to attach a modem or non-Amstrad printer.|$|E
50|$|The printer had an <b>expansion</b> <b>socket</b> {{under the}} front cover which could {{accommodate}} either Apple's AppleTalk network card or 32K memory buffer card, but not {{both at the same}} time. Sequential Systems produced a 2-in-1 solution card that combined both features into one card, as well as larger memory buffer cards up to 1 MB. With an optional AppleTalk networking card installed, it was a low-cost alternative to the vastly more expensive LaserWriter. Another third-party innovation was an add-on peripheral called the ThunderScan, which allowed the printer to work as a low-cost optical scanner (the scanner mechanism temporarily replaced the ink ribbon cartridge).|$|E
