25|$|Armstrong {{suggested}} Betsy Andreu {{may have}} been confused by possible mention of his post-operative treatment which included steroids and EPO that are taken to counteract wasting and red-blood-cell-destroying effects of intensive chemotherapy. The Andreus' allegation was not supported {{by any of the}} eight other people present, including Armstrong's doctor Craig Nichols, or his medical history. According to Greg LeMond (who has been embroiled with his own disputes with Armstrong), he (LeMond) had a recorded conversation, the transcript of which was reviewed by National Public Radio (NPR), with Stephanie McIlvain (Armstrong's contact at Oakley Inc.) in which she said of Armstrong's alleged admission 'You <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in that room. I heard it.' However, McIlvain has contradicted LeMond's allegations on the issue and denied under oath that the incident in question ever occurred in her sworn testimony.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
500|$|On April 12, 2014, Stefani made a {{surprise}} {{appearance at the}} Coachella festival, where she joined Pharrell Williams onstage during his set to perform [...] "Hollaback Girl". On April 29, it was officially confirmed that Stefani would join the seventh season of The Voice as a coach, replacing Christina Aguilera. After nine years since the last time, she attended the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, and during an interview {{on the red carpet}} she said, [...] "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> gonna have a baby, I didn't <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> gonna be on The Voice, I didn't <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> gonna be writing new music, so I'm just like, what's gonna be next?". Stefani appears as a featured artist on Maroon 5's song [...] "My Heart Is Open", co-written by Sia Furler, from the band's album V, which was performed {{for the first time with}} Adam Levine and an orchestra at the 2015 Grammy Awards. Stefani also collaborated with Calvin Harris on the track [...] "Together" [...] from his album Motion.|$|E

500|$|Amid {{frequent}} court appearances battling {{to stay in}} the United States, Lennon became stressed, {{a situation}} that was only worsened by constant surveillance by the FBI, due to his political activism. Lennon said, [...] "I just couldn't function, you <b>know?</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so paranoid from them tappin' the phone and followin' me." [...] All this combined made Lennon begin to feel emotionally withdrawn. Lennon put his suffering aside to write the songs for Mind Games, writing all the songs for it in a week.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{announcement}} that Erica was being written out of Grey's Anatomy, Smith was asked whether she was happy with the direction the storyline had taken. She responded: [...] "You <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> starting to get there, yeah. I was personally a little impatient with the gay panic, {{but it was more}} Callie's thing anyway. I think Dr. Hahn was sort of figuring it out." [...] She deemed the scene which saw Callie sleep with Mark as practice for sleeping with Erica [...] "a little icky", adding: [...] "If you're a woman, don't you know how to please yourself?" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{defeating}} Nikolay Davydenko at Wimbledon 2012, Murray pointed upwards {{with both}} hands and wagged them back and forth while looking to the sky. Murray declined to reveal the reason, and ever since, he has continued to celebrate his victories with this gesture. Murray marked his first Wimbledon title in 2013 with the same victory salute. Then in his book 'Seventy-Seven; My Path to Wimbledon Glory', released in November 2013, Murray said: “The real reason is that around that time I had a few friends and family who had various issues affecting them [...] [...] [...] I knew that they would be watching and I wanted to let them <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking of them.” ...|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable {{responses}} [...] "I am not frightened of dying. [...] Any time will do: I don't mind. [...] Why should I be frightened of dying? There's no reason for it– you've got to go sometime" [...] and closing words [...] "there is no dark side in the moon, really. [...] As {{a matter of fact}} it's all dark" [...] came from the studios' Irish doorman, Gerry O'Driscoll. [...] Paul and Linda McCartney were also interviewed, but their answers were judged to be [...] "trying too hard to be funny", and were not included on the album.

[...] When asked about Howard's positioning for Arsenal's equaliser, he replied: [...] "Tim wanted three in the wall and he will learn from that. This isn't America." [...] Silvestre denied suggestions that the win gave United a psychological edge over Arsenal: [...] "This is still a pre-season game. We won the Premiership title with a strong run {{at the end of}} last season." [...] Howard was unsure whether he would displace Barthez in the first team for a prolonged run – [...] "that's not my decision", though continued [...] "We have four great goalkeepers and we're looking to have a good battle all season long." ...|$|E
500|$|Forbidden Zone {{featured}} Bright's first work on film, and {{his only}} {{work as an}} actor (under the name [...] "Toshiro Baloney"). A {{founding member of the}} Mystic Knights, Bright later became a screenwriter and director in his own right. Bright's credits include Freeway, Ted Bundy, and Tiptoes. Bright and director Richard Elfman's only dispute during the screenwriting process was over a scene in which his character, Squeezit, was originally to have been beaten up for eight minutes and having the walls wiped with his blood. Another scene cut from the script would have had Squeezit being castrated. According to Bright, [...] "I didn't have any sense of limits or balance then, at the time, I... you <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just, didn't know what I was doing. I needed reining in." [...] During filming, Bright was sitting on the set in costume when a lighting stand fell onto his head, cracking his skull, and he had to be rushed to the hospital. When Bright returned to work the next day, he had a mild concussion and whiplash, but he continued with filming.|$|E

500|$|Yahoo! Voices {{wrote that}} Stevens [...] {{in the third}} season [...] "has become more condescending and passive {{aggressive}} herself, more than anyone else." [...] Heigl was critical of her character's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George, which she deemed [...] "a ratings ploy". Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now. She's changed a lot." [...] Attempting to rationalise Izzie's actions, Heigl later assessed that: People who are so infallible, perfect and moral tend {{to be the first to}} slip and fall. But I would love to see how she deals with the consequences of what she's done, because what’s interesting is when people make decisions that shake their world, they suddenly have to go, 'Woo, I didn't <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> capable of this.' I'd like to see Izzie take some culpability.|$|E
500|$|Kyle Busch, who {{finished}} second, said, [...] "He {{was on a}} mission today, that's for sure. When Jeff Gordon has a good car {{and he has the}} opportunity to beat you, he's going to beat you. He's my hero. I've always watched him and what he's been able to accomplish over the years." [...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll have to talk to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there, but I watched the tape and I think he really did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you can still do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E
500|$|People's {{reactions}} varied: some {{described themselves}} as [...] "shocked"; others admitted to being [...] "shaky" [...] or nervous {{for the rest of}} the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My husband and I were in the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".|$|E

500|$|Jaws was {{the first}} major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, {{resulting}} in a troubled shoot that went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget [...] "was $4million and the picture wound up costing $9million"; the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks. Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname [...] "Flaws". Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; [...] "I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same," [...] he said. As for his lack of experience: [...] "I was naive about the ocean, basically. I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who thinks he can conquer the elements was foolhardy, but I was too young to <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being foolhardy when I demanded that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank." [...] Gottlieb said that [...] "there was nothing to do except make the movie", so everyone kept overworking, and while as a writer {{he did not have to}} attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived [...] "ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water".|$|E
500|$|Even by the {{standards}} of the British Army, the Regiment (and the 1st Battalion in particular) seems to have gained a reputation during the First World War for profane language. When the 1st Battalion was relieved in the front line following its defence of Delville Wood in September 1916, one of the advanced posts was missed out by mistake. The Lance-Corporal in command, suspecting something was amiss, sent a man back to the front-line trench to investigate. The soldier realised he was at some risk of being shot by his own side, and so [...] "when he had crawled within shouting distance he enquired politely but firmly what —— bastards were holding that —— trench. The 9th East Surreys, who were the troops thus addressed, recognised the North Stafford idiom and let him in unhurt". Bernard Martin, who served as a 2nd Lieutenant with the 1st Battalion, records another incident which probably took place in 1917, when (very unusually) the battalion was addressed at a church parade by a general, who railed against [...] "the disgusting word many of you utter every time you speak. ... I tell you again this indecent word is not to be used any longer. It is so common amongst you that it has become the shameful nickname by which your battalion is known throughout my Division". As the parade ended, one soldier was heard to ask, [...] "What was that bugger gassing about?"; to which another replied, [...] "Buggered if I <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> having a kip. Where's the old bugger gone now?".|$|E
500|$|In a December 18, 2000 {{article for}} People {{magazine}} entitled [...] "Bad to Worse", Downey's stepmother Rosemary told author Alex Tresnlowski that Downey {{had been diagnosed}} with bipolar disorder [...] "a few years ago" [...] and added that his bipolar disorder was [...] "the reason he has a hard time staying sober. What hasn't been tried is medication and intensive psychotherapy." [...] In the same article, Dr. Manijeh Nikakhtar, a Los Angeles psychiatrist and co-author of Addiction or Self-Medication: The Truth (...) , says she received a letter from Downey in 1999, during his time at Corcoran II, asking for advice on his condition. She discovered that [...] "no one had done a complete [...] evaluation ...I asked him flat out if he thought he was bipolar, and he said, 'Oh yeah. There are times I {{spend a lot of money}} and I'm hyperactive, and there are other times I'm down.'" [...] In an article for the March 2007 issue of Esquire, Downey told author Scott Raab that he wanted to address [...] "this whole thing about the bipolar" [...] after receiving a phone call from [...] "the Bipolar Association" [...] asking him about being bipolar. When Downey denied he had ever said he was bipolar, the caller quoted the People article, to which Downey replied, [...] "'No! Dr. Malibusian said ...', and they go, 'Well, it's been written, so we're going to quote it.'" [...] Downey flatly denied being [...] "depressed or manic" [...] and that previous attempts to diagnose him with any kind of psychiatric or mood disorder have always been skewed because [...] "the guy I was seeing didn't <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> smokin' crack in his bathroom.
