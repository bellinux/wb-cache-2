But, you know, we had one member of the United States Senate vote against the PATRIOT Act, the blank check that was given by Congress to this president, I think in total abrogation of the role of Congress under separation of powers and under the power to make war, to declare war. They gave that away to a president that didn’t have his facts straight and, I think, was manipulating the intelligence to sell this war.|$|E

500|$|Jasmine's song [...] "A Whole New World", {{which she}} {{performs}} as {{a duet with}} Aladdin, won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 65th Academy Awards in 1993. Six years after Aladdin, Salonga {{would go on to}} be cast as the singing voice of second Disney Princess, Mulan, in 1998. Salonga joked about being required to audition for the role despite having already voiced a Disney Princess: [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> audition?... I was already a princess before. Wasn't that enough?" [...] Meanwhile, Larkin would return to voice Jasmine several times in subsequent media appearances, including films, video games and television series. As the two actresses responsible for giving voice to the character, both Larkin and Salonga were honored with Disney Legends awards for their contributions in 2011 at a ceremony recognized for awarding several other actresses who famously voiced Disney Princesses. In addition to songwriters Menken and Tim Rice, Salonga jokingly thanked Larkin {{for not being able to}} sing and thus providing her with a job. Salonga became the award's first Filipina recipient; her hand print is also imprinted at the Walt Disney headquarters in Burbank, California.|$|E

500|$|Upon being cast as Mulan's {{speaking}} voice, Wen {{was immediately}} informed by Disney {{that she would}} not be providing the character's singing voice. The actress took no offense to this decision, commenting jokingly [...] "I don't blame them." [...] The directors hired Filipina singer and actress Lea Salonga to dub the character's respective singing voice, heard in the film's songs [...] "Reflection", [...] "I'll Make a Man Out of You" [...] and [...] "A Girl Worth Fighting For", on Wen's behalf. According to Thomas S. Hischak, author of the book Disney Voice Actors: A Biographical Dictionary, Salonga was originally cast to provide both Mulan's speaking and singing voices. However, the directors eventually felt that her attempt at impersonating a man in the form of Mulan's male alter-ego [...] "Ping" [...] was rather unconvincing, and ultimately replacing Salonga with Wen. Six years prior to Mulan, Salonga provided the singing voice of Princess Jasmine in Disney's Aladdin (1992) on behalf of American actress Linda Larkin.

500|$|Lee {{found that}} in {{contrast}} to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a [...] "very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed {{like a human being}} and getting sympathy, they feel they have to do things, they have to carry the movie." [...] Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is [...] "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him <b>do,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing... and not [...] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now." [...] For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's death. Grant had been unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, [...] "'There's no other way, and I promise you it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' and he was very good about it". Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.|$|E

The programme lost to BBC2's The Wrong Mans, as determined by a panel made up of television experts and commentators.

500|$|The lyrics on Riot Act {{were more}} direct than on {{preceding}} records, {{in response to}} the political climate after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Bassist Jeff Ament commented that he felt that love was a major theme of the album, and Vedder tried to convey themes such as love, loss and struggle to make a difference because of the difficulty in leading with events such as the September 11 attacks and the accidental death of nine fans during Pearl Jam's performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival – [...] "You start feeling like, 'What <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say? What is my opinion?' Then I realized I did have an opinion. Not only did I have one, but I felt like it was formed by processing a lot of information and having good influences. Ament also told that [...] "I think the time's right to turn our voice up a bit [...] And Ed did it in a great way, with humour and a mystical, magical approach. It isn't just, 'We're pissed off, and fuck you! Riot! Anarchy!' Cos I don't think that's the method. At least at this point." [...] Vedder, however, said, [...] "I have to admit this record came out a bit one-sided. But I think we as a country need to understand why we're involved in the Middle East. This hollow patriotism frightens me." [...] The singer added that the Riot Act lyrics [...] "represent my state of mind these days. I'm optimistic yet disillusioned, hopeful yet frustrated." [...] Several songs on the album were inspired by Roskilde tragedy, with the album's first single, [...] "I Am Mine", being written by Vedder in 2000 in a hotel room before the band's first show after Roskilde, and [...] "Love Boat Captain" [...] including a brief lyrical reference ("Lost nine friends we'll never know... two years ago today"). Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, [...] "There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Klee's artistic {{breakthrough}} came in 1914 when he briefly visited Tunisia with August Macke and Louis Moilliet and {{was impressed}} by the quality of the light there. [...] He wrote, [...] "Color has taken possession of me; no longer <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> chase after it, I know that it has hold of me forever... Color and I are one. I am a painter." [...] With that realization, faithfulness to nature faded in importance. Instead, Klee began to delve into the [...] "cool romanticism of abstraction". In gaining a second artistic vocabulary, Klee added color to his abilities in draftsmanship, [...] and in many works combined them [...] successfully, as he did in one series he called [...] "operatic paintings". One of the most literal examples of this new synthesis is The Bavarian Don Giovanni (1919).|$|E
2500|$|Hou Junji was resentful that, {{despite his}} great achievement, {{he was put}} under arrest, albeit briefly.

[...] Encinia orders her to [...] "get out of the car", and, when she repeatedly refuses to exit, he tells her she is under arrest. Bland repeatedly asks why she is under arrest, and Encinia responds, [...] "I am giving you a lawful order." [...] She refuses to leave her car, stating she is not under arrest as she is unaware of the reason and not obliged to. Encinia then opens her car door and tells her {{more than a dozen}} times {{to get out of the}} car before [...] he tries to pull her out.

After the bout, Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach stated, [...] "We knew we had him after the first round. He had no legs, he was hesitant and he was shot."

In September of the same year, Bishop Josef Stangl granted the priest Arnold Renz permission to exorcise according to the Rituale Romanum of 1614, but ordered total secrecy. Renz performed the first session on 24 September. Michel began talking increasingly about [...] "dying to atone for the wayward youth of the day and the apostate priests of the modern church", and she refused to eat towards the end. At this point, her parents stopped consulting doctors on her request and relied solely on the exorcism rites. 67 exorcism sessions, one or two each week, lasting up to four hours, were performed over about ten months in 1975–1976.|$|E
