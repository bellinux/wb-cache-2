500|$|Asked about {{a debate}} Davis moderated with alien {{abduction}} believer John E. Mack, Davis {{said that many}} people expected him to support Mack, but they discovered that he was [...] "way on the other side". [...] Davis recounted that he had some great discussions with Mack; [...] "He was brilliant... he was wrong, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good...</b> One {{of the problems with}} human intelligence is that we are so good at defending ideas that we arrived at irrationally." ...|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Bullock, another {{board member}} of the {{organizing}} committee and also head of the Utah League of Cities and Towns, often clashed with Romney at the time, and later said that Romney deserved some credit for the turnaround {{but not as much as}} he claimed. Bullock said: [...] "He tried very hard to build an image of himself as a savior, the great white hope. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> at characterizing and castigating people and putting himself on a pedestal." ...|$|E

500|$|The novel Drive by James Sallis was {{published}} in 2005. Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review in Publishers Weekly. The driver intrigued Siegel because he was [...] "the kind of character you rarely see anymore [...] {{he was a man}} with a purpose; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> at one thing and made no apologies for it". The character interested Platt, because he reminded him of movie heroes he looked up to as a child, characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood.|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on the serial, Nigel Kneale said, [...] "Frankly, I {{was never}} {{happy with the}} whole idea in the first place. The central idea was too ordinary". Although Kneale {{was pleased with the}} high {{production}} values, he was dissatisfied with the casting, believing that John Mills [...] "didn't have the authority for Quatermass". He was similarly unimpressed with Simon MacCorkindale, noting that [...] "We had him in Beasts playing an idiot and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> at that". Kneale disliked the depiction of the Planet People, as his inspiration had been angry punks rather than hippies (as evidenced by his portrayal of Kickalong as a gun-toting lunatic who commits multiple motiveless murders). Producer Ted Childs thinks that [...] "the primary problems with it were (a) it was perhaps too depressing a story for a popular television audience and (b) the punters were used to a fairly high standard of technical presentation from American television... And we just couldn't afford that". Executive producer Verity Lambert's opinion is that it [...] "didn't have the staying power of the originals, but then that's almost inevitable when you try to bring something back in a slightly different form".|$|E
500|$|Lee {{found that}} in {{contrast}} to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a [...] "very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed {{like a human being}} and getting sympathy, they feel they have to do things, they have to carry the movie." [...] Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is [...] "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him do, I have to say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing... and not [...] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now." [...] For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's death. Grant had been unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, [...] "'There's no other way, and I promise you it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> about it". Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.|$|E

2500|$|MacCorkindale played {{astronomer}} Joe Kapp in Nigel Kneale's TV serial Quatermass (1979), starring alongside John Mills. He {{had previously}} starred in {{an episode of}} Kneale's series Beasts and enjoyed appearing {{in the role of}} Kapp, finding it a change from the typecast romantic roles that he had become accustomed to playing, while noting that it was [...] "challenging" [...] conveying the character's strong Jewish faith. Kneale later expressed disappointment with MacCorkindale's performance, commenting, [...] "We had him in Beasts playing an idiot and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> at that".|$|E
2500|$|He was a {{moderate}} {{on the right}} during the series of splits in the Labour Party in the 1950s. He was a supporter and friend of Hugh Gaitskell. He persuaded Gaitskell to temper his initial support for British military action in 1956 when the Suez Canal was seized by the Nasser regime in Egypt, resulting in the Suez Crisis. When Gaitskell died in 1963, he was horrified {{at the idea of}} Gaitskell's volatile deputy, George Brown, leading Labour, saying [...] "He was like immortal Jemima; when he was good <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> but when he was bad he was horrid". He voted for James Callaghan in the first ballot and Harold Wilson in the second. Healey thought Wilson would unite the Labour Party and lead it to victory in the next general election. He didn't think Brown was capable of doing either. He was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Defence after the creation of the position in 1964.|$|E
2500|$|Hull’s {{ideas were}} so {{appealing}} {{in part because}} of his professional background in engineering. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> with math and numbers, and incorporated his numerical knowledge into the field of psychology. He followed the acceptable understanding of psychology at that time, and was influenced by the work and the conclusions of the pioneers of Behaviorism (Edward Thorndike, John B. Watson and Ivan Pavlov). However, Hull was able to add his own twist to understanding reinforcement and learning in a way that had never been done before by putting everything in numbers and equations. Hull was also influenced by Isaac Newton’s work. Newton had created his equations to understand astronomical theories, but Hull decided to create his own equations to understand psychological-behavioral theories. Hull had dared to mix scientific laws and mathematics with the field of psychology, a technique many prominent psychologists {{would not be able to}} comprehend and apply. Hull contributed to the motivation domain of psychology. He had quantified the Drive concept in an equation to prove that habit strength is a function of reinforcement.|$|E
