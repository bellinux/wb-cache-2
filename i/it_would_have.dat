5|$|The Manned Orbital Telescope was a {{proposal}} for a manned spacecraft for astronomical or solar observation. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> used the larger reentry module which was also proposed for the Big Gemini spacecraft, and would have been launched on a Saturn IB. The enlarged reentry module was also considered for a spacecraft proposed at the same time, which would have been used to rescue the crews of manned spacecraft that were stranded in low Earth orbit. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> launched atop a Titan IIIC, once in orbit <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> maneuvered by means of a Transtage integrated into the equipment module. The larger capsule would have been used to accommodate the crew of the spacecraft which required rescuing.|$|E

5|$|Adalimumab {{is a drug}} {{targeting}} TNF alpha. Its name {{can be broken down}} into ada-lim-u-mab. Therefore, the drug is a human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune system. If adalimumab had been named after 2009, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been adalumab.|$|E

5|$|Free-flights of Progress {{spacecraft}} typically lasted {{two days}} from launch to docking with Mir, however Progress M1-5 took {{three days to}} reach Mir in order to conserve fuel for the deorbit burn.

5|$|In 1988, the East German {{leadership}} considered {{proposals to}} replace the expensive and intrusive fortifications with a high-technology system codenamed Grenze 2000.
