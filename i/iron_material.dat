500|$|A major {{development}} of the 9th century period concerns the somewhat enigmatic Wiślanie, or Vistulans (Bavarian Geographer's Vuislane) tribe. The Vistulans of western Lesser Poland, mentioned in several contemporary written sources, were already a large tribal union {{in the first half}} of the 9th century. In the second half of the century, they were evolving into a super-tribal state until their efforts were terminated by more powerful neighbors from the south.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the fatigue life of three cast <b>iron</b> <b>materials,</b> namely EN-GJS- 700, EN-GJV- 450 and EN-GJL- 250, is {{predicted}} for combined thermomechanical fatigue and {{high cycle fatigue}} loading. To this end, a mechanism-based model is used, {{which is based on}} microcrack growth. The model considers crack growth due to low frequency loading (thermomechanical and low cycle fatigue) and due to high cycle fatigue. To determine the model parameters for the cast <b>iron</b> <b>materials,</b> fatigue tests are performed under combined loading and crack growth is measured at room temperature using the replica technique. Superimposed high cycle fatigue leads to an accelerated crack growth as soon as a critical crack length and thus the threshold stress intensity factor is exceeded.

40|$|Cast <b>iron</b> <b>{{materials}}</b> {{are used}} as materials for cylinder heads for heavy duty internal combustion engines. These components must withstand severe cyclic mechanical and thermal loads throughout their service life. While high-cycle fatigue (HCF) is dominant for the material in the water jacket region, the combination of thermal transients with mechanical load cycles results in thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) of the material in the fire deck region, even including superimposed TMF and HCF loads. Increasing {{the efficiency of the}} engines directly leads to increasing combustion pressure and temperature and, thus, lower safety margins for the currently used cast <b>iron</b> <b>materials</b> or alternatively the need for superior cast <b>iron</b> <b>materials.</b> In this paper (Part I), the TMF properties of the lamellar graphite cast iron GJL 250 and the vermicular graphite cast iron GJV 450 are characterized in uniaxial tests and a mechanism-based model for TMF life prediction is developed for both materials. The model can be used to estimate the fatigue life of components by means of finite-element calculations (Part II of the paper) and supports engineers in finding the appropriate material and design. Furthermore, the effect of the elastic, plastic and creep properties of the materials on the fatigue life can be evaluated with the model. However, for a material selection also the thermophysical properties, controlling to a high level the thermal stresses in the component, must be considered. Hence, the need for integral concepts for material characterization and selection from a multitude of existing and soon-to-be developed cast <b>iron</b> <b>materials</b> is discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, mechanism-based models are {{developed}} {{to describe the}} time and temperature dependent cyclic plasticity and damage of cast <b>iron</b> <b>materials.</b> The cyclic plasticity model {{is a combination of}} a viscoplastic model with kinematic hardening and a porous plasticity model to take the effect of graphite inclusions into account. Thus, the model can describe creep, relaxation and the Bauschinger-effect as well as the tension-compression asymmetry often observed for cast iron. The model for thermomechanical fatigue life prediction is based on a crack growth law, which assumes that the crack growth per cycle, da/dN, is correlated with the cyclic crack-tip opening displacement, Delta CTOD. The effect of the graphite inclusions on crack growth is incorporated with a scalar factor into the crack growth law.

The stress strain behaviour of the matrix is obtained from tensile tests on a pure ferritic material. The influence of stress triaxiality and void shape on the critical void volume fraction is studied. Tensile tests with smooth and notched specimens are simulated to verify the load-deformation behaviour. The effect of the graphite morphology on fracture toughness is studied by tests and simulations of SE(B) -specimens [...] Fracture resistance curves can be well predicted. A correlation between element size and particle distance is found...|$|R
50|$|The company Kellogg Bridge Co. {{undertook}} to construct for the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway Company an iron bridge across Maumee River at Toledo, Ohio. After doing {{a portion of}} the work it entered into a written contract with Hamilton (a subcontractor) for the completion of the bridge. The bridge was put up in several spans and in order to support the spans, falsework, consisting of piles driven in the river between the piers upon which the spans were to rest, was needed. The Bridge Company had previously constructed a part of the falsework involved in {{between the first and second}} spans, which Hamilton paid for as he had agreed to do. A part of the falsework put up by the company sank under the weight of the first span and was replaced by Hamilton. When the second fixed span was about two-thirds complete, ice in the river broke up due to a flood and the falsework was carried away causing the whole of the <b>iron</b> <b>material</b> in place on that span to fall into the river. If the piles had been driven in more firmly, they would have withstood the force of the ice and the flood. Hamilton was subject to delay of the completion of the bridge and increased expense.|$|E

The 21 -ft long PRB was installed in November 1999 to test a construction technique that uses a biodegradable polymer slurry to support an open excavation while a granular iron/sand mixture was placed into the subsurface.

40|$|AbstractThe {{characteristic}} {{formation of}} graphite microstructures defines {{the physical and}} mechanical properties of cast irons. The graphite morphology of cast iron structures can be classified according to their shape, arrangement and size using as reference the structure micrographs specified in the standards ASTM A 247 - 67 and DIN EN ISO 945. These specific values do not provide any mathematical correlation between microstructure and mechanical properties. The application of quantitative image analysis in microstructure investigations allows a statistically reproducible evaluation method. Although cast irons were quite often focus of research works in this sector, the graphite morphology classification has been mainly handled devoid of any quantitative correlation to material properties. In this article an interrelationship between the fatigue strength of cast <b>iron</b> <b>materials</b> and a quantitative characteristic of the graphite microstructure was established.
