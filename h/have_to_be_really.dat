Fleder, who agreed to interviews for the documentary but refused to wear a microphone on the set, said of the crew, [...] "To pull off a show like this, a seven-day shoot with this much dialogue and this many shots per day, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>really,</b> really focused, and for me the thing with the documentary crew kept pulling away from the focus." ...|$|E

That in turn leads liberals and conservatives toward separate news sources." [...] Times executive editor Dean Baquet stated that he does not believe coverage has a liberal bias, but that: [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> careful that people feel like they can see themselves in The New York Times.

[...] One of the band's previous singles, [...] "Bring Me to Life", was also written about Josh Hartzler. In an interview with VH1, Lee further revealed the inspiration behind the song, saying [...] "I had gone through a lot of difficult things during the writing of the whole album, and by the end of it, I had stepped away from those bad situations.

I mean, there are probably five or six guys who could play Cochran's role, but who else is there who could play the role of Tibbey? The Tiburon character <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> charming and Anthony has that in spades.

This is very encouraging except now we stand naked in judgement. It <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> good with two to three million dollars invested. The last version, with Laurence Olivier as Heathcliff and Merle Oberon as Cathy, portrayed him as a regular nice guy and her as sweetness and light.

40|$|Baldessari {{started to}} produce collages out of {{black-and-white}} movie stills in 1976. Even if {{his work is}} decidedly anti-dogmatic, over time the production of these images seems to follow a recurring pattern. The process is simple: The artist goes to a shop and buys second- rate movie stills, files them away using a provisional classification system, then selects some and cuts parts of them, sometimes add- ing touches of colour to certain areas, sometimes adding coloured dots and sometimes combining various images together. Baldessari selects the most generic images, the ones with no identity – the “stuff nobody wants”: At one place I go to for movie stills, I look where the photographs are randomly thrown in boxes. It’s stuff nobody wants. Photographs they can classify or identify go upward in price... The stuff I get is twenty-five cents a shot. But I like that because I don’t want stills from movies that I’ve seen or when I’m familiar with the stars.
