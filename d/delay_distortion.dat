40|$|International audienceAdaptive {{scheduling}} {{is becoming}} an increasingly important issue in wireless video communications, which are widely used in the industry and academic organizations. However, existing scheduling schemes for real-time video services in wireless networks generally do {{not take into account}} the relationship between the transmission <b>delay</b> and video <b>distortion.</b> In this paper, we develop and evaluate a delay-distortion-aware wireless video scheduling scheme in the framework of cross-layer information adaptation. At first, we construct a general video distortion model according to the observed wireless network parameters, as well as each video sequence's rate-distortion characteristic. Then, we exploit a distortion-aware wireless video scheduling scheme and derive a bound on the asymptotic decay rate of the video distortion. Furthermore, the relationship between the <b>delay</b> and <b>distortion</b> is studied by taking into account video application <b>delay</b> and <b>distortion</b> requirements for specific wireless network environments. The proposed scheme is applied to heuristically find optimal tradeoff between the <b>delay</b> and <b>distortion.</b> Extensive examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed scheme. © 2010 Elsevier B.

50|$|Note: Frequency {{frogging}} {{is accomplished}} by having modulators, which are integrated into specially designed repeaters, translate a low-frequency group to a high-frequency group, and vice versa. A channel {{will appear in the}} low group for one repeater section and will then be translated to the high group for the next section because of frequency frogging. This results in nearly constant attenuation with frequency over two successive repeater sections, and eliminates the need for large slope equalization and adjustments. Singing and crosstalk are minimized because the high-level output of a repeater is at a different frequency than the low-level input to other repeaters. It also diminishes group <b>delay</b> <b>distortion.</b> A repeater that receives on the high band from both direction and sends on the low band is called Hi-Lo; the other kind Lo-Hi.|$|E
30|$|Digital {{technologies}} are transforming the global economy. In his pioneering book Being Digital (1995), technology futurist Nicholas Negroponte (1995), described how the old industrial economy would be eaten {{away by a}} new digital economy. Moreover, digital technology {{makes it possible for}} members of an organization to self-organize and thereby avoid the <b>delays,</b> <b>distortions,</b> and other damaging effects of hierarchically organized systems (Benkler, 2002). Established companies recognize that digital technologies can help them operate their businesses with greater speed and lower costs and, in many cases, offer their customers opportunities to co-design and co-produce products and services (Sambamurthy et al. 2003). Many start-up companies use digital technologies to develop new products and business models that disrupt the present way of doing business and take customers away from firms that cannot change and adapt.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{some technical}} problems and proposes a solution {{related to the}} implementation of a robust switching between single-side and double-side lobe tracking modes in case of BOC modulated signals, in particular BOC(M,N), with M, N > 1. It is demonstrated that typical group <b>delay</b> <b>distortions</b> due to wide-band front-end filters can potentially lead to code tracking biases, increasing the risk of false locks and degrading the performance of the BOC tracking loops. These effects represent also a potential problem for the coexistence of the side-lobe switching functionality with other advanced algorithms in professional-grade GNSS receivers. These practical issues are investigated and a possible solution is demonstrated by means of simulation results, considering the BOC(M,N) modulations in the Galileo E 1 a and E 6 a bandwidth...|$|R

50|$|The newest {{version of}} the Mandala, mk2.9, is a {{standard}} class-compliant USB MIDI controller (no special drivers required) which uses a computer as its sound source. When the pad is struck it sends a MIDI trigger note with velocity {{as well as a}} position value (in the form of a MIDI continuous controller) across a USB cable into a computer. A Virtual Brain program is included with mk2.9 and has a set of included instrument samples and multiple effects (filters, <b>delay,</b> <b>distortion,</b> etc.) which can be applied to individual zones or to the overall surface. Unlimited user samples can also be added to the included sound library. Any parameter of any effect can be controlled by the position (0-127) or velocity (0-127) of a surface strike, resulting in effects such as bending pitch, changing delay time, or increasing reverb as the pad is played from center to edge. The position controller and velocity controller can be scaled to the player's liking. Factory preset sound configurations are included with the Virtual Brain as well as unlimited empty slots for user created presets. Drummers can also modify panning and note settings for each zone. The Virtual Brain program is not required to play the Mandala because the pad is a MIDI controller that can trigger any software that accepts MIDI input.|$|E

40|$|Joint {{amplification}} {{of multiple}} carriers {{with a single}} wideband high power amplifier (HPA) has been considered towards reusing the satellite resources among multiple links to reduce the mission cost. The non-linear characteristic of the HPA, especially near saturation, coupled with the on-board IMUX/ OMUX filters result in non-linear adjacent carrier interference (ACI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI) during multicarrier power amplification. To benefit from the advantages of multicarrier transmissions, on-ground techniques to mitigate the non-linear distortions need to be devised. These techniques include predistortion at the transmitter and equalization at the receiver. Several works have considered the use of multicarrier predistortion along with single carrier equalization. A symbol synchronous equalizer, while being simple to implement, may not necessarily provide for the optimum linear filter. Towards improving the performance, fractionally spaced equalizers (FSE) have been considered. Such receivers are shown to provide enhanced performance by effectively compensating for the group <b>delay</b> <b>distortions.</b> The objective of this work is to consider the use of FSE {{in the context of}} multicarrier transmissions over non-linear channels and illustrate their performance enhancement...|$|R

40|$|Atmosphere causes <b>delay</b> <b>distortions</b> in {{synthetic}} aperture radar images. Numerical weather prediction models, which compute the forecast stepwise, are beneficial in correcting this distortion. After initialization, the model needs time to reach a balanced state, such that first prediction steps contain errors. The imbalance causes false predicted precipitation, which then affects the water vapor distribution. Correspondingly, the predicted zenith path delay (ZPD), which depends on this distribution, {{is affected by the}} initial imbalances. The digital filtering initialization (DFI) technique reduces these imbalances and the ZPD prediction disturbances, respectively. The objective of this paper is the accuracy gain for ZPD predictions, which is achieved by this technique. For the accuracy gain investigation, predicted ZPD time series of the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model with and without DFI are compared against Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) -derived time series from 233 GNSS stations mainly located in Germany. Three conclusions are found. First, the experiment confirms that the DFI technique improves the precipitation forecast. Second, the corresponding accuracy gain, i. e., the bias of ZPD predictions, improves by about 13 %. Third, the accuracy gain is only valid for the first 4 h of the prediction...|$|R
