5|$|Unable {{to secure}} funding for further work and {{allegedly}} suffering from health problems, Kurosawa apparently reached the breaking point: on December 22, 1971, he slit his wrists and throat multiple times. The suicide attempt proved unsuccessful and the director's health recovered fairly quickly, with Kurosawa now taking refuge in domestic life, uncertain if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> direct another film.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{home from}} Belgrade on 6 February, the {{aeroplane}} carrying Edwards {{and his team}} mates crashed on takeoff after a refuelling stop in Munich, Germany. Seven players and 14 other passengers died at the scene, and Edwards {{was taken to the}} Rechts der Isar Hospital with multiple leg fractures, fractured ribs and severely damaged kidneys. The doctors treating him were confident that he stood some chance of recovery, but were doubtful that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> be able to play football again.|$|E
5|$|Gilberto's doctor {{ordered him}} to wear a back brace for three months to aid the healing of the {{fractured}} bone. Gilberto returned to his native Brazil {{for the duration of}} his rehabilitation. During his time there, he doubted whether <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> be able to play football again, due to speculation that his injury could threaten his career. Despite his concerns, his long rehabilitation time paid off as he made a full recovery. He made his footballing comeback in Arsenal's 4–1 victory over Norwich City on 22 April 2005. During the whole 2004–05 season, Gilberto was injured for 7 months and played only 17 games. His absence, combined with Arsenal's slump in form at the time, led to much discussion regarding the importance of Gilberto to the Arsenal team; some suggesting that Arsenal struggled without him. Gilberto's difficult 2004–05 season ended in consolation as Arsenal finished runners-up in the Premier League and won the FA Cup against Manchester United in a penalty shoot-out.|$|E

5000|$|... "Second Advertisement for Myself" [...] - After his {{stint in}} the Army, Mailer spent all his time working on The Naked and the Dead. The novel was a bigger success than <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>ever</b> imagined. But it led to {{questions}} about whether <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> <b>would</b> be able to repeat that success. In a sense, he writes, {{he may have been}} trying to evade that question by writing Barbary Shore.|$|R
60|$|And if <b>he</b> did, who <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> know?--Not even Grace herself. The {{secret was}} his, {{and no one}} else's.|$|R
5|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War I excited Baker, as it finally {{gave him a}} purpose in life and allowed him to {{make good use of}} his pilot training. He left the United States for Europe in the summer of 1917, among the first group of Americans to do so. Though eager to join the front immediately, Baker was told that he had to be {{certified}} by the French. Success in the courses was dependent on how quickly the pilots learned French, the predominant language of instruction. Though he managed to complete all the courses easily, a lack of qualified teachers meant that Baker was first sent to a school in England for more training and then back to France to teach Americans what he had learned in England, in an attempt to create pilots as quickly as possible. This discouraged Baker, who was eager to get into the front lines and fight. Owing to a lack of aircraft supplies, Baker was stuck in Paris, and doubted <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> get to the front. While in Paris, he was happy to continue seeing Scott, who had enlisted as a nurse and worked at a hospital in France.|$|E
25|$|He {{played in}} 24 games in 1961. Though his average {{declined}} to 22.30, he took 95 wickets, the closest <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> get to reaching 100.|$|E

25|$|In {{light of}} these findings, court juror Mr. Westenrieder criticized the trial procedures. He assumed that the money {{laundering}} allegations by Mollath were inaccurate. The presiding judge interrupted and threatened Mollath with throwing him out of court, if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> mention the issue of tax evasion and black money transfers again.|$|E
25|$|With the {{appointment}} of Boynueğri Mehmed Pasha as grand vizier on 26 April 1656, Abaza Hasan again came into favor at court. He was granted the rank of pasha and appointed governor of Diyarbakır. He also continued to administer the Yeni Il Türkmen through his kethüda (steward), who was granted the office. On 2 February 1657 he was transferred to Aleppo, the final post <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> hold.|$|E

50|$|Moynihan {{reunited with}} Irvine for a one-off concert in Galway in 2001. He is an erratic character, though, {{and it was}} {{considered}} doubtful if <b>he</b> and Irvine <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> play together again.|$|R
25|$|Brown {{finished}} {{the game with}} five receptions for 137 yards and a touchdown, while Riggins rushed for 123 yards and two touchdowns. In addition, his 36-yard completion to Brown was the only completion <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> throw during his 14-season career. This was the only postseason meeting between Hall of Fame coaches Bill Walsh and Joe Gibbs, whose teams would combine for six Super Bowl appearances and five Super Bowl wins during the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|When Henry was a boy, {{it seemed}} highly {{unlikely}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> inherit the throne of France, since Henry II had produced four surviving sons. However, the prince of Navarre's pedigree gave him a special place of honour in the French nobility, since all scions of the Bourbon line were acknowledged as the princes of the blood. As Head of the House of Bourbon, Henry was officially the First Prince of the Blood, the first nobleman of the kingdom.|$|E
25|$|On 22 December 1845, Peder Ludvig Møller, {{who studied}} at the University of Copenhagen {{at the same time}} as Kierkegaard, {{published}} an article indirectly criticizing Stages on Life's Way. The article complimented Kierkegaard for his wit and intellect, but questioned whether <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> be able to master his talent and write coherent, complete works. Møller was also a contributor to and editor of The Corsair, a Danish satirical paper that lampooned everyone of notable standing. Kierkegaard published a sarcastic response, charging that Møller's article was merely an attempt to impress Copenhagen's literary elite.|$|E
6000|$|He {{got as far}} as the table, and {{clung to}} it, his teeth set. Grizel clapped her hands. [...] "Excellently done!"

25|$|Finally in 1953/54, Maddocks got {{his chance}} to play Sheffield Shield and took part in all seven matches Victoria played, scoring 345 runs at 28.75. He also took his only {{first-class}} wicket, in a match against New South Wales at the MCG. With the visitors chasing just 68 for victory in their fourth innings, Maddocks was allowed a bowl and dismissed opener Ron Briggs caught behind, by his brother and Test cricketer Len Maddocks. It was the only full season <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> play but he also made some appearances in the 1955/56 and 1957/58 competitions.|$|E
25|$|The peace {{concluded}} in 1763 reduced {{the size of}} the army, and forced Roche to retire in indigent circumstances to London, where he soon lived beyond his income. In order to repair it, he managed to marry a Miss Pitt, who had a fortune of £4,000 (approximately £100,000 in today's money). Unfortunately, on the anticipation of this fortune, Roche engaged in a series of extravagances that accumulated debts beyond his marriage portion. He was arrested and cast into the King's Bench Prison, where his wife divorced him and where so many detainers were laid upon him so that it seemed unlikely that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> go free. However, a legacy left him by a relation enabled him to escape confinement.|$|E
25|$|On the {{positive}} side, having two engines was a built-in insurance policy. Many pilots made it safely back to base after having an engine failure en route or in combat. On 3 March 1944, the first Allied fighters reached Berlin on a frustrated escort mission. Lieutenant Colonel Jack Jenkins of 55FG led {{the group of}} P-38H pilots, arriving with only half his force after flak damage and engine trouble took their toll. On the way into Berlin, Jenkins reported one rough-running engine, causing him to wonder if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> make it back. The B-17s {{he was supposed to}} escort never showed up, having turned back at Hamburg. Jenkins and his wingman were able to drop tanks and outrun enemy fighters to return home with three good engines between them.|$|E
50|$|In his mass-market {{anthology}} The Portable Henry Rollins, Rollins {{stated that}} he had given 2.13.61 its name because someone {{had told him that}} his first self-released book, 20 (1984), had to have a company name on it, and since he felt at the time that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> only <b>ever</b> get to release one book, he simply used his birthdate.|$|R
25|$|Following {{his strong}} showings for Manchester City {{in the early}} 2007–08 season, it was {{reported}} on 23 August 2007 that The Football Association (FA) were investigating Schmeichel's international status, {{to see if there}} was any chance of him foregoing his Danish international status in order to play for England. Schmeichel, however, stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> only <b>ever</b> play for Denmark.|$|R

25|$|Ben Howland {{was hired}} as {{head coach of the}} Panthers in 1999–00 and led them to {{sustained}} success for 4 seasons. In Howland's second season (2000–01), the Pitt team, led by senior standout Ricardo Greer and All-American guard Brandin Knight, advanced to the Big East Tournament championship game and NIT. In Howland's third (2001–02) and fourth (2002–03) seasons, Pitt won back-to-back Big East regular season championships, appeared in back-to-back Big East tournament championship games and won the Big East tournament in 2003. Pitt advanced to consecutive NCAA tournament Sweet Sixteens (2002, 2003). For his success in the 2001–02 season, Howland was named the Big East Coach of the Year, Naismith College Coach of the Year, and won the Henry Iba Award as best college basketball coach as named by the United States Basketball Writers Association. Following the 2003 season, Howland left Pitt for the only job he said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> contemplate leaving Pitt for: the head coach position at UCLA.|$|E
25|$|Olson, {{who had an}} {{extensive}} criminal history, was arrested on August 12, 1981, on suspicion of attempts to abduct two girls. By August 25, Olson {{had been charged with}} the murder of Judy Kozma. He reached a controversial deal with authorities, agreeing to confess to the 11 murders and show the RCMP the location of the bodies of those not yet recovered. In return, authorities agreed that $10,000 for each victim was paid into a trust for his wife, Joan, and then-infant son, Clifford III. His wife received $100,000 after Olson cooperated with the RCMP, the 11th body being a 'freebie'. In January 1982, Olson pleaded guilty to 11 counts of murder and was given as many concurrent life sentences to be served in Canada's super-maximum security Special Handling Unit in Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec, which houses many of the country's most dangerous criminals. Olson was a dangerous offender, meaning it was very unlikely <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> have been released from prison.|$|E
25|$|After {{recording}} an 8–8 {{record in}} 1988, Elway once again led {{his team to}} the Super Bowl after the 1989 season, with yet another win over the Browns in the AFC championship game, going on to face the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV. However this game ended even worse for the Broncos than their previous Super Bowl losses. San Francisco blew out Denver 55–10, the most lopsided score in Super Bowl history. Although Elway scored the only touchdown for his team on a three-yard run, his performance was abysmal: 10 out of 26 completions for 108 yards with no touchdown passes and two interceptions. But he didn't try {{to hide from the}} media after the game or downplay his dismal performance. And when he was asked if he {{wanted to go back to}} the Super Bowl after three losses, he responded that he wanted to go back every year, even if his team kept losing. Still by this point, many doubted that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> win a Super Bowl in his career.|$|E
