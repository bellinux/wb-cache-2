5|$|Antibodies are protein {{components}} of an {{adaptive immune system}} whose main function is to bind antigens, or foreign substances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction, antibodies have no such constraints. An antibody's binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high.|$|E
5|$|Like most arthropods, spiders lack {{balance and}} {{acceleration}} sensors {{and rely on}} their eyes to tell them which way is up. Arthropods' proprioceptors, sensors that report the force exerted by muscles {{and the degree of}} bending <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> joints, are well understood. On the other hand, little is known about what other internal sensors spiders or other arthropods may have.|$|E
5|$|Other {{specific}} {{underlying causes}} {{are treated as}} normally. For example, hemochromatosis is treated by venesection, the regular removal of a fixed amount of blood. Eventually, this decreases the iron levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> improves {{the function of the}} organs in which iron has accumulated.|$|E

5|$|Pharmacologically active plant {{extracts}} {{can interact}} with conventional drugs, both {{because they may}} provide an increased dose of similar compounds, and because some phytochemicals interfere with the body's systems that metabolise drugs in the liver including the cytochrome P450 system, making the drugs last longer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> have a more powerful cumulative effect. Plant medicines can be dangerous during pregnancy. Since plants may contain many different substances, plant extracts may have complex effects on the human body.|$|E
5|$|The hormones of the {{pituitary}} {{have different}} actions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> {{the symptoms of}} hypopituitarism therefore depend on which hormone is deficient. The symptoms may be subtle and are often initially attributed to other causes. In most of the cases, three or more hormones are deficient. The most common problem is insufficiency of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or luteinizing hormone (LH) leading to sex hormone abnormalities. Growth hormone deficiency {{is more common in}} people with an underlying tumor than those with other causes.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are {{secreted}} by B {{cells of}} the adaptive immune system, mostly by differentiated B cells called plasma cells. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the blood plasma, and a membrane-bound form that {{is attached to the}} surface of a B cell and {{is referred to as the}} B-cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.|$|E

5|$|Lead has {{no known}} physiologically {{relevant}} role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> its harmful effects are myriad. Lead and other heavy metals create reactive radicals which damage cell structures including DNA and cell membranes. Lead also interferes with DNA transcription, enzymes that {{help in the}} synthesis of vitamin D, and enzymes that maintain {{the integrity of the}} cell membrane. Anemia may result when the cell membranes of red blood cells become more fragile as the result of damage to their membranes. Lead interferes with metabolism of bones and teeth and alters the permeability of blood vessels and collagen synthesis. Lead may also be harmful to the developing immune system, causing production of excessive inflammatory proteins; this mechanism may mean that lead exposure is a risk factor for asthma in children. Lead exposure has also been associated with a decrease in activity of immune cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Lead also interferes with the normal metabolism of calcium in cells and causes it to build up within them.|$|E
5|$|The membrane-bound {{form of an}} {{antibody}} may {{be called}} a surface immunoglobulin (sIg) or a membrane immunoglobulin (mIg). It {{is part of the}} B cell receptor (BCR), which allows a B cell to detect when a specific antigen is present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> triggers B cell activation. The BCR is composed of surface-bound IgD or IgM antibodies and associated Ig-α and Ig-β heterodimers, which are capable of signal transduction. A typical human B cell will have 50,000 to 100,000 antibodies bound to its surface. Upon antigen binding, they cluster in large patches, which can exceed 1 micrometer in diameter, on lipid rafts that isolate the BCRs from most other cell signaling receptors.|$|E
5|$|The text classifies {{three levels}} of breath regulation, namely Puraka (पूरक, satisfying), Kumbhaka (कुम्भक, prominent) and Rechaka (रेचक, purging). The Puraka {{exercise}} is shortest and counts twelve moments (matras, music beats); the Kumbhaka is medium and stretches over twenty-four moments, while the Rechaka is highest lasting thirty-six moments. The text then describes various combinations of Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka in various asanas {{for the purposes of}} energizing the Nadis and cleansing the body, asserting that, when mastered, Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana and other vital airs help gain endurance, calmness, measured speed, ascension and inner healing. The text says that Pranayama exercises have therapeutic powers. Yajnavalkya describes Sanmukhi mudra, Kevaka kumbhaka and Sahita kumbhaka in chapter 6, asserting that the best exercises are those that make one feel lightness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> relaxation in the mind.|$|E

5|$|Thrombolysis is enzymatic {{destruction}} of blood clots. This {{is achieved by}} the administration of a drug (such as urokinase or alteplase) that activates plasmin, an enzyme that occurs naturally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> digests clots when activated. Thrombolysis is an accepted treatment for heart attacks and stroke unrelated to dissection. In cervical artery dissection, only small case series are available. The thrombolytic drug is administered either intravenously or during cerebral angiography through a catheter directly into the affected artery. The data indicates that thrombolysis is safe, but {{its place in the}} treatment of VAD is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|To {{function}} in gas exchange, lungs required a blood supply. In cartilaginous fishes and teleosts, the heart lies low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> pumps blood forward through the ventral aorta, which splits up {{in a series}} of paired aortic arches, each corresponding to a gill arch. The aortic arches then merge above the gills to form a dorsal aorta supplying the body with oxygenated blood. In lungfishes, bowfin and bichirs, the swim bladder is supplied with blood by paired pulmonary arteries branching off from the hindmost (6th) aortic arch. The same basic pattern is found in the lungfish Protopterus and in terrestrial salamanders, and was probably the pattern found in the tetrapods' immediate ancestors as well as the first tetrapods. In most other bony fishes the swim bladder is supplied with blood by the dorsal aorta.|$|E
5|$|While the {{mutagenic}} and genotoxic {{effects of}} TCDD are sometimes disputed and sometimes confirmed it does foster {{the development of}} cancer. Its main action in causing cancer is cancer promotion; it promotes the carcinogenicity initiated by other compounds. Very high doses may, in addition, cause cancer indirectly; one of the proposed mechanisms is oxidative stress and the subsequent oxygen damage to DNA. There are other explanations such as endocrine disruption or altered signal transduction. The endocrine disrupting activities seem {{to be dependent on}} life stage, being anti-estrogenic when estrogen is present (or in high concentration) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> estrogenic in the absence of estrogen.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTau is {{abundant}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> axon, whereas MAP 2 is found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cell <b>body</b> <b>and</b> dendrites. To understand their differential localization, we performed transfection studies on primary cultured neurons using tagged tau, MAP 2, MAP 2 C, and their chimeric/deletion mutants. We found that MAP 2 was prevented {{from entering the}} axon by its N-terminal projection domain and that microtubule binding of tau was stronger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> axon than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cell <b>body</b> <b>and</b> dendrites, whereas that of MAP 2 /MAP 2 C was tighter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cell <b>body</b> <b>and</b> dendrites than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> axon. These binding properties were determined by their microtubule-binding domains and were suggested to be regulated by phosphorylation, at least <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of tau. Thus, the suppressed axonal transit of MAP 2 and locally regulated microtubule binding may play important roles for their sorting in neurons...|$|R

5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E
