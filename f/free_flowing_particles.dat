40|$|Caking, whereby <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>particles</b> {{aggregate}} to form lumps is {{a common}} problem during handling and storage of food powders. Seasoning companies have experienced consumer dissatisfaction related to difficulties emptying the spice jar or get lumps of spices when emptying a bag with a spice blend. One way of preventing the caking development is to add {{a small amount of}} anti-­‐caking agent. One of the most widely used anti-­‐caking agent is silicon dioxide, labeled as E 551. During the past years, the consumer’s demand for products with fewer additives has increased. This project focused on finding natural anti-­‐caking agents that could replace silicon dioxide in spice products, to get a consumer-­friendly labeling while also solving the caking problem. The caking development was studied in the easily caked Lemon juice powder and Red Onion Seasoning mix containing native potato starch, inulin and a rice fiber as natural anti-­‐caking agents. The replacing alternatives were evaluated based on how they affect the sorption isotherm, glass transition and flowability, as well as sensory properties of the host powders. Moisture sorption isotherms as well as glass transition analysis clarified that water has a large impact on the caking development in the hygroscopic host powders. Glass transition measurements in combination with the flowability analysis, demonstrated that 5 % native potato starch, at lower relative humidities theoretically {{could be used as a}} silicon dioxide replacer. It was shown that the glass transition temperature of Lemon juice powder was increased while adding 5 % native potato starch, which theoretically indicates less stickiness, and consequently reduced risk of caking. Further, Lemon juice powder containing 5 % native potato starch presented flow function in the free flowing area, which further promotes its use as a natural anti-­‐caking/ flowagent. The result from the sensory analysis confirmed that there is no significant difference between products containing 1. 7 % silicon dioxide and 5 % native potato starch...|$|E

The ibuprofen solubility in water (zero ethanol) is low (~ 50 ppm) but increases near exponentially with increasing ethanol content. At 40 °C, there is phase separation between 34 % and 63 % w/w E/(E+W).

40|$|The direct {{simulation}} Monte Carlo (DSMC) algorithm, {{introduced in}} 1976 by G. A. Bird, {{proves to be}} extremely efficient for simulating dilute gas flows. However, due to the relatively large transport coefficients at low densities, a high Rayleigh or Reynolds number is difficult to achieve by this technique. We present {{a modified version of}} DSMC in which the relaxation processes are enhanced and the transport coefficients reduced. This is achieved by increasing the ratio between collisions and <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> of <b>particles</b> in a suitable way. The modified algorithm is mostly useful for statistical physics applications, since it leads to the correct fluctuation spectrum. Several computational experiments are described; they demonstrate that the correct equilibrium and nonequilibrium fluid properties are preserved. The new algorithm is shown to be significantly more efficient than molecular dynamics for simulating complex hydrodynamical flows. © 1995 Academic Press. All rights reserved.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{formulate}} and evaluate microspheres of Terbutaline sulphate (TBS) by water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) double emulsion solvent diffusion method using ethyl cellulose. The influence of formulation factors viz. drug content and polymer content on physicochemical properties of the microspheres was investigated by using 32 factorial design to investigate the joint influence of two variables: the Drug content (X 1) and Polymer content (X 2) on the Encapsulation efficiency (EE), time for 50 % drug dissolution (t 50) and time for 70 % drug dissolution (t 70). The microspheres were found to be comparatively smooth, spherical in shape and <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> with <b>particle</b> size ranges from 17 µm to 24 µm. The yield was found to be in the range of 48 – 76 %.

Microcapsules were found to be irregular in shape, <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> with wide <b>particle</b> distribution in the range of 178 - 422 µm with 75 % drug content. Both Rifampicin and Isoniazid microcapsules exhibited prolonged release with first order kinetics. Rifampicin and Isoniazid microcapsule suspension formulation was characterized for pH, viscosity, sedimentation rate and drug content. The developed suspension was found to be uniform with drug content between 99 - 100 %. Stability studies indicated that Rifampicin and Isoniazid suspension formulation exhibited greater stability as compared to pure drug suspensions. Hence, Rifampicin and Isoniazid suspension exhibits a potential to be developed as controlled release paediatric and geriatric formulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{evaluated}} {{the potential of}} counter current spray drying to produce engineered crystalline particles in-situ. One main feature of the counter current spray dryer is in inducing droplet drying history with a progressively increasing drying rate; {{in contrast to a}} co-current spray dryer in which the particle is immediately confronted with high driving force of evaporation. In addition, counter current dryer provides higher residence time for particles within the drying chamber. This work explored the manipulation of these unique features of counter current spray drying to control the crystallinity of the particles formed. Sucrose, lactose and mannitol were spray dried as model materials exhibit contrasting crystallization. Counter current spray drying was suitable in producing well defined crystalline lactose particles mainly due to the higher residence time. The produced lactose particles were composed of agglomeration of fine thin lactose crystals. Surprisingly, the counter current spray drying with relatively lower initial evaporation rate resulted in amorphous mannitol particles. Fully crystalline mannitol was produced when the feed spray temperature was elevated leading to rapid supersaturation. This may be an important strategy to control the crystallinity of mannitol particles particularly for pharmaceutical application. Similar feed pre-heating strategy in conjunction with counter current spray drying was used for sucrose drying. Crystalline sucrose was achieved with relatively lower drying temperature. This will be a valuable strategy for producing <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> sucrose <b>particles</b> specifically for the food industry...|$|R

Drug release from the microspheres was found slow, followed first order kinetics with non fickian release mechanism and release dependent on nature and concentration of polymers...|$|R
40|$|A {{digital imaging}} based method for {{measuring}} the velocity of pneumatically conveyed particles is described in this paper. The measurement system consists of a laser sheet for illumination, a CCD camera for particle image acquisition and bespoke image processing software. By controlling the exposure time of the camera, blurred images of moving particles are captured, which contain velocity information of the particles. The relationship between the motion blur length and the particle velocity is established using a lens model of the camera. To improve the robustness of the system to noise in the acquired particle images, a traveling wave equation (TWE) method is used to estimate the motion blur length and then deduce the particle velocity. In addition to computer simulations, experimental work on a a <b>free</b> fall <b>particle</b> <b>flow</b> rig and pneumatically conveying test rig is carried out.

40|$|In this work, {{we study}} several fluid-structure {{interaction}} problems in two dimensions using the "Immersed Boundary (IB) method". The IB method is a versatile and robust approach for simulating {{the interaction of}} complex, elastic structures with an incompressible fluid flow. The method {{has been used to}} simulate a wide range of biological and non-biological fluid-structure interaction problems. The particular choice of problems we study is motivated by the dynamics of biofilms which are characterized by flow-induced deformation of complex structures as well as <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> suspended biofilm <b>particles.</b> In this work we consider massless as well as massive structures. For the massive structures, mass is incorporated by distributing point masses at a collection of IB points on and inside the structure. Our mathematical model for massive IB structures uses a Boussinesq approximation which is valid for $Deltarho leq rho_f$, where $rho_f$ is the density of the fluid and $Deltarho$ is the density difference between the structure and fluid. We consider gravitational settling of massive particles and aim to capture hydrodynamic interactions with bounding walls as well as other particles. In all cases, we perform extensive numerical simulations and comparisons to other published experimental and numerical results in the literature. Then we consider the deflection of a flexible cantilever beam in response to a shear flow. Our numerical results are discussed in the context of analytical results from the linear beam theory.

The first two flows are characterized by synchronization of the phase, while the others do not have the global synchronization. Among these, the disordered jam flow is very complex, although the underlying model is simple. This phenomenon implies that the crowd behavior of moving particles can be destabilized by coupling their velocity to the phase of their motion. We also focus on "phase-anchoring" phenomena.

Micro <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> electrophoresis is a separation technique that continuously separates analyte streams as they travel through an electric field applied perpendicularly to the flow in a microfluidic device. The continuous {{nature of this}} separation technique makes it an ideal choice {{for a number of}} applications including long term continuous monitoring and as a second dimension separation technique in a two dimensional separation scheme. In order for micro <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> electrophoresis devices to reach their full potential in these applications, improvements to the stability of separated analyte streams and zero dead volume connections to these devices must be addressed. This work will detail a simple, yet effective, way for mitigating the effects of electrolysis bubbles on analyte stream stability in micro <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> electrophoresis devices by addition of surfactant or organic modifier to the electrolyte carrier buffer.
