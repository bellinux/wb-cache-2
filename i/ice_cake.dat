60|$|For a {{long time}} that fish was to me the most puzzling thing in the whole incident; for at that season no fish are to be found, except in deep water off shore. Some weeks later I learned that, just {{previous}} to the incident, several fishermen's dories, with full fares, had been upset {{on the east side of}} the island when trying to land through a heavy surf. The dead fish had been carried around by the tides, and the owl had been deceived into showing his method of fishing. Undoubtedly, in his northern home, when the ice breaks up and the salmon are running, he goes fishing from an <b>ice</b> <b>cake</b> as a regular occupation.|$|E
6000|$|In his {{southern}} visits, {{or perhaps}} {{on the ice}} fields of the Arctic ocean, he has discovered a more novel way of procuring his food than digging for it. He has turned fisherman and learned to fish. Once only have I seen him get his dinner in this way. It was {{on the north shore}} of Nantucket, one day in the winter of 1890-91, when the remarkable flight of white owls came down from the north. The chord of the bay was full of floating ice, and swimming about the shoals were thousands of coots. While watching the latter through my field-glass, I noticed a snowy owl standing up still and straight {{on the edge of a}} big <b>ice</b> <b>cake.</b> [...] "Now what is that fellow doing there?" [...] I thought.--"I know! He is trying to drift down close to that flock of coots before they see him." ...|$|E
60|$|So I prowled from swamp to swamp, seeing {{nothing but}} the sickly trunks which grew up out of thinly frozen slime, while no sound made by either bird or beast broke the {{impressive}} silence of the primeval solitude. At last, when the day was nearly spent, I crawled toward a larger muskeg, which spread out from a running creek, and knelt in congealed mire behind a blighted spruce, listening intently, for a sound I recognized set my heart beating. All around, dwindling in gradations as the soil grew wetter, the firs gave place to willows, and there was mud and <b>ice</b> <b>cake</b> under them. Peering hard into the deepening shadows, I saw what I had expected--a patch of shaggy fur. This {{was one of the}} small black bears, and the creature was grubbing like a hog among the decaying weed for the roots of the wild cabbage, which flourishes in such places. Some of these bears hibernate in winter, I believe, but by no means all, for the bush settlers usually hunt them then for their fur. No summer peltry is worth much.|$|E

60|$|There {{would have}} been no great {{difficulty}} in bringing the man down at that range, even in a bad light, and it is probable that nobody would have blamed me; but, though I should willingly have ridden him down in fair chase, I could not fire on him as he sat there at my mercy, for if he was armed it must have been with a pistol--a very poor weapon against a rifle. I might also have shot the horse; but one hesitates to sacrifice a costly beast, even {{in the service of the}} State, and, strange to say, I felt inclined to trust his promise. Accordingly, I did neither; and when a great <b>ice</b> <b>cake</b> came driving down, and, raising his hand again as though in recognition of my forbearance, he wheeled the mare and vanished into a thicker rush of snow, I stood motionless and let him go. Then, feeling more shaken and dizzy than before, I seized the bridle and led the horse into the whirling whiteness that drove down the slope. Darkness came suddenly. I could scarcely see the trees, and it was by accident I stumbled upon the troopers dismounted and picking their way.|$|E

50|$|The Thompson Ice House {{stands on}} the east side of SR 129, just south of its {{junction}} with McFarlands Cove Road. It is set between the road and Thompsons Pond, a 3 acre freshwater pond. The ice house is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled main section flanked on its long sides by shed-roof ells. Its exterior walls are unpainted horizontal pine boards, and its interior walls are separated from the outside by a nine inch gap filled with sawdust for insulation. Large doors on the east and west sides facilitate the movement of large <b>ice</b> <b>cakes</b> into and out of the building. The east (pond-facing) side has a channel which could be used to float the <b>ice</b> <b>cakes</b> into the building and onto conveyors that would move it into the storage area that occupies most of the building.|$|R

50|$|In September 2006 two Americans Steve House and Vince Anderson {{made their}} {{bid for the}} summit. Despite two weeks of attempts, House and Anderson didn't manage to {{complete}} their initial objective---acclimatizing climb of <b>Ice</b> <b>Cake</b> Peak, reaching only 5900 meters in continuing bad weather and high winds. The climb of the southwest face of Kunyang Chhish East began on September 10, 2003. Once again the summit was not reached, the climbers stopped 300m from the top. The climbers cited inadequate acclimatization, tiredness, cold winds as reasons for turning back..|$|E
50|$|The {{first attempt}} to scale the peak took place in June 2003. A Korean expedition, however, gave up at 6100m feeling it was too {{difficult}} to continue the climb in a safe manner. Since their Camp 2 had been established near <b>Ice</b> <b>Cake</b> Peak, six out of ten members of the expedition (including Park Sung Man, Yen Yong Hum, Shim Yeong Keon, Jang ke Seob, Ko Jung Sig and Kim Man Kun) decided to ascend the summit of this 6,450m peak on the south ridge of Kunyang Chhish before returning to base camp.|$|E
50|$|Another attempt came in July 2003 by a Polish {{expedition}} {{consisting of}} Grzegorz Skorek (who died in 2004 returning from his climb of the 6995m north face of Khan Tengri), Janusz Golab and Stanislaw Piechuch. The first {{objective of the}} team was to acclimatize by climbing <b>Ice</b> <b>Cake</b> Peak, which they reached on August 5, 2003. Yet the team's main goal of climbing Khunyang Chhish East in alpine style was postponed until August 15 because of the weather conditions. After a period of heavy rain and snow the three decided to make their summit attempt. Due to continued unfavorable weather conditions, having made three bivouacs and reaching the height of 6700m the team retreated.|$|E

50|$|Austrian Hansjörg Auer and Swiss Simon Anthamatten set up basecamp on June 12 and acclimatized, amongst {{others by}} {{climbing}} 6,400 m <b>Ice</b> <b>Cake</b> Peak. Due to a thumb injury, Hansjorg's brother Matthias could only join later and, {{for a lack}} of acclimatization, could not participate in the first two attempts on the 2,700 m southwest face between June 25 and 28 and on July 2. After a period of poor weather, all three started a final try on July 14. After spending two nights at camp 3 at 6700 m, the winds calmed down and the team reached the summit over a spectacular corniced ridge at 12:30 pm on July 18. This ascent was nominated as one of the five finalists for the 2014 Piolet d'Or.|$|E
40|$|In this resource, {{students}} will discover {{that there are}} notable differences between sea ice and fresh-water ice, such as density. In on segment, students learn that {{the first sign of}} freezing on the sea is an oily appearance of the water caused by the formation of needle-like crystals. The site explains the relationship between growth and the rate at which heat flows from the water and that the ice pack can alter its shape and dimension due to the movement of winds, currents, thermal expansion, and contraction of the ice. Types of ice described here include new ice, nilas, young ice, first-year ice, and old ice while the forms of ice covered include pancake ice, brash ice, <b>ice</b> <b>cake,</b> floe, and fast ice. The site also explains the meteorological and oceanographic factors that control the amount and movement of ice. Educational levels: High school, Middle school, Undergraduate lower division...|$|E

50|$|It was {{postulated}} that small rafts of ice form around {{the rocks and}} the rocks are buoyantly floated off the soft bed, thus reducing the reaction and friction forces at the bed.
