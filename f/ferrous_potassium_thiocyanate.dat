40|$|Little {{published}} {{research has been}} conducted on the chemical enhancement of soil contaminated footwear marks. Investigations into the application, including the advantages and limitations of processes available for the enhancement of footwear marks in soil were carried out as part of this study. This included a comparison of current enhancement solutions such as <b>potassium</b> <b>thiocyanate,</b> ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, potassium ferrocyanide and bromophenol blue. The solutions were compared on the basis of sensitivity, sharpness of the colour reaction and their application to a range of commonly encountered substrates. The best preforming chemical enhancement technique for footwear impressions in soil was found to be <b>potassium</b> <b>thiocyanate.</b> <b>Potassium</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> was further explored to study the effects of aging the mark deposited as well as assessing the stability (shelf life) of the solution. It was found that the age of the mark appeared to have no significant effect on its ability to be chemically enhanced using <b>potassium</b> <b>thiocyanate.</b> The stability study of <b>potassium</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> revealed that whilst aged solutions still enhanced footwear marks, background staining, fading and deterioration in colour sharpness were all observed...|$|R

The results under transient polarization conditions infer the reduction of Cr 2 + ions with second electron transfer as a slow step. The observed cyclic voltammetric data show that the alloy deposition is possibly from Cr-complex. Stripping voltammograms show the existence of chromium rich alloy phases.

40|$|A {{total of}} 36 calves {{were used in}} three {{experiments}} to test the efficacy of a <b>potassium</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> extract of Pasteurella haemolytica in protecting against experimental pneumonia. In each of experiments A and B, 12 calves were divided into three equal groups. The first group was vaccinated with an aerosol of a <b>potassium</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> extract twice, two weeks apart; the second group was vaccinated subcutaneously once only with the same extract. The third group of calves in both experiments remained as unvaccinated controls. In experiment C, six calves were vaccinated intramuscularly and six were left as controls. Approximately one month after vaccination all calves were challenged with an aerosol of bovine herpesvirus 1 (isolate 108) followed in 4 d by an aerosol of P. haemolytica type A 1 (the same strain from which the <b>potassium</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> extract had been made). Varying degrees of protection against subsequent development of experimental pneumonic pasteurellosis in cattle were seen in vaccinated calves as compared to control calves in these experiments.

40|$|The heat {{capacities}} of ammonium and <b>potassium</b> <b>thiocyanates</b> {{were determined by}} adiabatic calorimetry over the range 5 to 340 K, and associated thermodynamic functions were computed from the results.
