40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{selected}} kinematic characteristics of distance runners over a twenty year period. The subjects in the investigation were 14 long distance runners who at the time of the first observation were considered highly trained (running more than 50 miles per week). The second observation occurred approximately 20 - 23 years after the first observation. At this time the average weekly mileage per runner had decreased to 37 miles per week. The first observation's data were collected with a Locam camera at <b>film</b> <b>speeds</b> <b>ranging</b> from 60 to 120 frames/second. The film data were digitized at the same time as the second observation's data. The second observation's data were collected with a Panasonic 5000 shutter video camera. The Peak Performance Motion Measurement System video interface allowed a 60 frame/second field rate. Ten subjects ran at a speed of 3. 4 m/s; two subjects at the speeds of 3. 1 and 3. 6 m/s; and one subject at each of the following speeds: 4. 0, 4. 5, and 4. 9 m/s. Statistical analyses (ANOVA) of the stride length, stride frequency, support and non-support time, and joint angular displacement indicated no significant difference (p >. 05) between the first observation and the second observation. The results of this study indicated that the kinematics of continually active long distance runners do not change with an increase in age. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
