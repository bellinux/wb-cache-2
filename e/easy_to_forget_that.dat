25|$|Looking at Head's {{life and}} the clearly {{scientific}} route that it took, it is often <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> he was also to become a poet. Through his mother he had gained a love of literature and this would do much to direct his choice of acquaintances in later life when he was to become firm friends with authors (most notably to Thomas Hardy) and a mentor to the poet Siegfried Sassoon. This passion was also to initiate another, as in literature he and his future wife Ruth (a writer in her own right) were to find common ground.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{overwhelming}} impact, influence and enduring legacy of The Grammar of Ornament, {{it can be}} <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> Jones was, during his lifetime, well known {{to the public for}} his work as an architect. This skew in our contemporary perception of Jones's work is made particularly acute because many of Jones's built projects have since been demolished or otherwise destroyed – most notably the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, which was lost forever due to a fire in 1936. His most important building was St James's Hall, which was located between Piccadilly and Regent Street and for almost fifty years was London's principal concert hall. Jones was also responsible for two grand shopping emporiums: the Crystal Palace Bazaar and a showroom for Osler’s, the glassware manufacturer, both in the West End. These three buildings all opened within a few years of each other, between 1858 and 1860, but had all been demolished by 1926. Their sumptuous polychromed interiors of cast iron, plaster and stained glass were breathtaking monuments to leisure and consumption.|$|E
50|$|The Drama in the Balkans after 1990 let out {{the mysterious}} disease. Unfortunately the so needed Commission of Experts was not ever charged {{to solve this}} mystery. If this {{committee}} would work freely, not supervised or expelled then it would create a precise documentation which the Albanians themselves couldn’t create under that amount of pressure during the 1990s. A tile committee {{would be able to}} prove that in Kosovo the poisoning truly happened among the Albanian students who were affected with symptoms which cannot be caused by mass hysteria. No other committee had the chance to testify some of the other factors that spoke about poisoning. A good measure of this handicap was the fact that Radovanović article was unknown to the Albanian doctors as late as 2008. Therefore, he never subjected to criticism, and mass hysteria hypothesis was confirmed. During further 1990s ended up poisoning in 1990 {{in the shadow of the}} burnt villages, massacres and expulsion of one million people. The conversion to mass hysteria made it even <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> it originally was about a human rights violation.|$|R

500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{to be released}} in summer 1977, but was pushed back to November because of the various problems during production. Upon its release, Close Encounters had a huge impact on society and became a certified box office success, grossing $116.39million in North America and $171.7million in foreign countries, totaling $288million. It became Columbia Pictures' most successful film at that time. Jonathan Rosenbaum refers to the film as [...] "the best expression of Spielberg's benign, dreamy-eyed vision." [...] A.D. Murphy of Variety gave a positive review but felt [...] "Close Encounters lacks the warmth and humanity of George Lucas's Star Wars". Murphy found most of the film slow-paced, but praised the film's climax. Pauline Kael called it [...] "a kid's film in the best sense." [...] Jean Renoir compared Spielberg's storytelling to Jules Verne and Georges Méliès. Ray Bradbury declared it the greatest science fiction film ever made. Based on 46 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 96% ("Certified Fresh") of the reviewers have enjoyed the film and the site's consensus states [...] "Close Encounters most iconic bits (the theme, the mashed-potato sculpture, etc.) have been so thoroughly absorbed into the culture that it's <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> its treatment of aliens as peaceful beings rather than warmongering monsters was somewhat groundbreaking in 1977." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{points of}} the work were {{inspired}} by Pharrell Williams, Kanye West, and other [...] "hip-hop style eccentrics".

[...] On [...] "Cashmere", Ben J and Legacy [...] "try to outdo each other to win {{the attention of a}} young woman, but, predictably, she spurns them both". The lyrics also cover their difference in style, as seen in [...] "Cricketz", as Legacy raps, [...] "Jeans stay skinny like I starve my fabric, Another damn thing/You’ll never see me care about another man’s jeans." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times responded, [...] "Baggy has been de rigueur in hip-hop for so long it’s <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> 25 years ago, rappers gladly wore tight denim.

[...] Some of the lyrics use double entendre, with the duo referring to themselves as [...] "rejects" [...] and [...] "jerks" [...] on [...] "Dot Com", which The Los Angeles Times called [...] "both a double-entendre for the dance moves spurring the craze, and illustrative of their generation’s reclamation of formerly nerdy archetypes." ...|$|E

Thompson noted that, [...] "If Gravy Train has any faults whatsoever, the fascination with peculiar vocal effects can grow a little wearing, especially as frontman Norman Barrett sic already {{appears to have a}} fabulous range of his own - [...] "Dedication to Sid", in particular, glories in such trickery, although the heartbeat bassline that runs through the number is so hypnotic <b>that</b> it's <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> everything else <b>that's</b> going on."

40|$|Using an {{experimental}} design, we compare two alternative approaches to dependent interviewing (proactive and reactive) with traditional independent interviewing on a module {{of questions about}} sources of income. We believe {{this to be the}} first large-scale quantitative comparison of proactive and reactive dependent interviewing. The three approaches to questioning are compared in terms of their effect on under-reporting of income sources and related bivariate statistics. The study design also enables identification of the characteristics of respondents whose responses are sensitive to the mode of interviewing. We conclude that under-reporting can be significantly greater with independent interviewing than with either form of dependent interviewing, especially for income sources that are relatively common or relatively <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget.</b> We find <b>that</b> dependent interviewing is particularly helpful as a recall aid for respondents below retirement age and registered disabled persons...|$|R

500|$|The {{scene in}} which Susie, dressed in a red evening dress, seductively {{performs}} [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] {{on top of a}} grand piano has since become iconic and often parodied, establishing itself as a modern cinema classic. As the film's most iconic scene, it quickly became [...] "the stuff of legend" [...] according to Creative Loafing's Matt Brunson. The Fabulous Baker Boys tends to be most remembered for this celebrated scene. The Guardians Jane Graham agreed that the film's title [...] "will immediately conjure up an image of a beautiful woman sliding her way across a grand piano", referring to Pfeiffer's performance as [...] "undoubtedly... the most memorable aspect" [...] of The Fabulous Baker Boys, rivaling performances by Marilyn Monroe. Vulture's Angelica Jade Bastién wrote that Pfeiffer elevates the scene [...] "to that small pantheon of definitive bombshell moments that strike with the force of a chemical reaction," [...] comparing it to Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe's performances in Gilda and Some Like It Hot, respectively. Additionally, Turner Classic Movies believes that [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] is largely responsible for Pfeiffer's Academy Award nomination. In 2000, Empire film critic Ian Nathan proclaimed that Pfeiffer's [...] "immaculate" [...] rendition of [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] had finally achieved [...] "classic" [...] status. Mike D'Angelo of The Dissolve likened the sequence's impact to those of other famous film performances and lines that [...] "are embodied in the cultural consciousness", such as [...] "You talkin' to me?" [...] from Taxi Driver (1976) and [...] "Get to the choppa!" [...] from Predator (1987), concluding, [...] "It's <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> ... <b>that</b> there was more to the movie—and to Pfeiffer's terrific work therein—than that one intensely erotic scene. InSing ranked the scene eighth on their [...] "30 sexiest scenes in movie history" [...] countdown. The Calgary Herald considers The Fabulous Baker Boys to be the ninth sexiest film of all-time largely due to [...] "Makin' Whoopee". Nerve ranked Pfeiffer the 33rd [...] "Greatest Female Sex Symbols in Film History", dubbing the actress' rendition of [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] "a play from a sex-symbol how-to guide." [...] After providing her own vocals in The Fabulous Baker Boys, Pfeiffer would eventually go on to sing in two more musical films, The Prince of Egypt (1998) and Hairspray (2007), earning positive reviews on each occasion.|$|E

30|$|The {{introduction}} and adoption {{of new technologies}} in learning and teaching has rapidly evolved over the past 30  years. Looking through the current lens, it is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> the debates <b>that</b> have raged in our institutions over students being allowed to use what are now regarded as rudimentary technologies. In a longitudinal study of accommodations for students with a disability conducted between 1993 and 2005 in the USA, authors remind us of how contentious the debate was surrounding {{the use of the}} calculators and spell check programs for students with a disability none-the-less the general student body (Lazarus et al. 2008). Assistive technologies—such as text to speech, speech to text, zoom capacity, predictive text, spell checkers, and search engines—are just some examples of technologies initially designed to assist people with a disability. The use of these technological solutions was later expanded, and we find them now as generic features in all personal computers, handheld devices or wearable devices. These technologies now augment the learning interactions of all students globally, enhancing possibilities opened for teaching and design of educational experiences.|$|R

Teaching English in elementary school is not <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> implement because young learner students have different characteristic with adult learners. By having various methods, not only make the teachers <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> deliver materials, but also make the students being more active and interested in English subject. Considering the statement above, {{the purpose of this study}} were; (1) to know the teaching methods used by the English teacher at first year of SDN 2 SurodakanTrenggalek, (2) to know the problems faced by the English teacher in applying teaching methods, and (3) to know the English teacherÂ’s way to solve the problems. The design of this study was descriptive qualitative research with an English teacher at first year of SDN 2 Surodakan Trenggalek as research subject. In collecting data, the writer used two kinds of instruments: observation and interview. The finding showed that the teachers used four kinds of teaching method. Those methods were role play method, question-answer method, art method and playing method. The problems faced by the English teacher in applying teaching methods were; the students were talking each other during teaching and learning activity, the students were shy or afraid to come forward and the students were <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> materials <b>that</b> they just learned. The English teacherÂ’s way to solve the problems were; the teacher gave some rewards to the students, the teacher asked more than one students to presents in front of the class, the teacher gave new vocabulary and the teacher gave songs related to the materials. In conclusion, the teaching methods were applied by the English teacher had some weaknesses. Yet, when the students had difficulties and mistakes, the teacher had been ready to help the students to solve those problems. The teacher also motivated the students to increase their ability in learning English...|$|R
60|$|I {{shall not}} attempt to repeat all that passed while the ship dropped down the bay; but enough escaped the gossips to render me still more unhappy than I had yet been, {{on the subject of}} Lucy. I could and did despise these people; that was easy enough; but it was not so <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> all <b>that</b> they said and surmised. This is one of the causes {{attendant}} on the habit of loose talking; one never knowing what to credit, and what not. In spite of all my disgust, and a firm determination not to contribute in any manner to the stock in trade of these people, I found great difficulty in evading their endless questions. How much they got out of me, by means of the process of negations, I never knew; but they got no great matter through direct affirmatives. Something, however, persons so indefatigable, to whom gossiping was the great aim of life, must obtain, and they ascertained that Mr. Hardinge was my guardian, that Rupert and I had passed our boyhoods in each other's company, and that Lucy was even an inmate of my own house the day we sailed. This little knowledge only excited a desire for more, and, by the end of a week, I was obliged to submit to devices and expedients to pump me, than which even the thumbscrew was scarcely more efficient. I practised on the negative system, myself, with a good deal of dexterity, however, and threw my inquisitors off, very handsomely, more than once, until I discovered that Wallace Mortimer, determined not to be baffled, actually opened communications with Neb, {{in order to get a}} clearer insight into my private affairs. After this, I presume my readers will not care to hear any more about these gentry, whose only connection with my life grew out of the misgivings they contributed largely to create in my mind, touching the state of Lucy's affections. This much they did effect, and I was compelled to submit to their power. We are all of us, more or less, the dupes of knaves and fools.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the role of {{cultural}} institutions in civil society from the broad perspective of cultural diversity values and human rights. Perhaps {{even more than the}} previous century, the 21 st century will be an era of rapid transformation: transformation in the physical environment, in technology, in human ecology. In a globalised world, not only will ever-more humans come into increasing contact with each other, but ever-more human creativity will produce further cultural content, {{at the same time there}} will be increasing drains on natural resources, cultural homogenisation and commodification. In these circumstances much cultural heritage, particularly intangible heritage, is at risk of disappearing. How human societies negotiate this environment - both globally and locally - will be critical challenges: challenges in social relations, legislation, public policy and security. In this increasingly chaotic and transformative world where ideas, events and systems are constantly re-forming, re-intersecting and re-creating, it is often <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> the role <b>that</b> culture, the arts and heritage institutions can play in mediating relations, negotiating community tensions, building sustainable futures, and standing as testimony to the human experience. Cultural institutions, such as museums, can respond to this situation in many ways. Will the ways of the past succeed, where human experience was treated as something to collect, catalogue, exhibit, archive? Or, will this taxonomic approach be replaced by one where cultural institutions are civic spaces that hold up a mirror to society, serve the diversity of the community that funds them, and even can be alive places that preserve living heritage? Cultural institutions can, in this sense, be like canaries in a mine: if they are highly sensitive to their environment (the wider social, political and cultural context in which they function) they may survive. Indeed, they may flourish if they are able to adapt to the needs of their communities in a dynamic, plural and increasingly integrated world...|$|R
