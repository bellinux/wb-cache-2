All enterococcal blood culture isolates at Royal Brisbane Hospital have been screened by agar dilution for <b>high</b> <b>level</b> {{resistance to}} gentamicin and strepto-mycin since 1989. Of 110 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, 16 % displayed <b>high</b> <b>level</b> resistance to gentamicin and 10 % showed <b>high</b> <b>level</b> resistance to streptomycin. Four isolates had <b>high</b> <b>level</b> resistance to both antibiotics. None of 23 Enterococcus faecium isolates displayed <b>high</b> <b>level</b> resis-tance to gentamicin and only one to streptomycin. Two Enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to amoxycillin but none to vancomycin.

40|$|ABSTRACT-In present time’s <b>High</b> <b>level</b> clones (HLC) is an {{emerging}} concept {{that uses a}} hierarchical organization of fine gained clone fragments (Simple clones) to form coarser-grained clones (<b>High</b> <b>Level</b> Clone). Different research groups categorize clones with respect to different contexts. In this paper we review all such available categories of clones and present them {{in the form of}} a <b>High</b> <b>Level</b> Clone Classification. Classification can serve various purposes like studying the more frequently occurring <b>high</b> <b>level</b> clones, prioritizing different types of <b>high</b> <b>level</b> clones, devising re-engineering strategies for different types of <b>high</b> <b>level</b> clones etc [...] For this classification of HLC we develop a fuzzy rule-based system and also visualize the results.

Various coagulation abnormalities have been described in the obese. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is present in <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> in people with obesity. Obese people also have larger numbers of circulating microvesicles (fragments of damaged cells) that bear tissue factor. Platelet aggregation may be increased, and there are <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of coagulation proteins such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VII and factor VIII.

During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed.

These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{disorders}} tend {{to occur}} in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, {{in the presence of}} repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder. Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there. It would appear that children in institutions like these are unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers. The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of indiscriminate friendliness. However, even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addressed}} {{the relationships among}} professional efficacy, emotional exhaustion, and job characteristics (job demands and job control) {{in the context of}} a two-wave panel study among 828 Dutch police officers. Based on the demand-control model, we expected that high demands/high control would be positively related to professional efficacy, and that high demands/low control would be related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of exhaustion. Moreover, we hypothesized that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of exhaustion would lead to lower levels of professional efficacy and that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of efficacy would lead to low levels of exhaustion. Structural equation modelling largely supported these predictions. High demands were longitudinally related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of efficacy and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of exhaustion; <b>high</b> control was longitudinally related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of efficacy. Further, efficacy and exhaustion were indeed mutually related. Finally, <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of exhaustion were longitudinally related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of demands. We conclude that there are complex, yet theoretically, and practically interpretable relations among efficacy, strain and work characteristics. © 2010 The British Psychological Society...|$|R

5|$|A recent test of {{this model}} {{involved}} a reciprocal transplants of seedlings of 20 species of trees between clay soils (nutrient rich) and white sand (nutrient poor) to determine whether trade-offs between growth rate and defenses restrict species to one habitat. When planted in white sand and protected from herbivores, seedlings originating from clay outgrew those originating from the nutrient-poor sand, but {{in the presence of}} herbivores the seedlings originating from white sand performed better, likely due to their <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of constitutive carbon-based defenses.
