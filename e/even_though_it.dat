5|$|A common {{concern among}} reviewers is the {{overhead}} perspective, which critics have bemoaned for {{preventing them from}} judging pathway routes and an object's location in relation to its background. Besides this, the actual visuals were generally well received, {{as well as the}} setting and animations. The audio was commended for combining both originality and nostalgia, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> looped frequently.|$|E

And Pittsburgh, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> has a lot of hills, it can be Indianapolis. We just have to find a couple of flat streets.|$|E
5|$|Category1 storms usually cause no {{significant}} structural damage to most well-constructed permanent structures; however, they can topple unanchored mobile homes, {{as well as}} uproot or snap weak trees. Poorly attached roof shingles or tiles can blow off. Coastal flooding and pier damage are often associated with Category1 storms. Power outages are typically widespread to extensive, sometimes lasting several days. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> is the least intense type of hurricane, the storm can still produce widespread damage and can be a life-threatening storm.|$|E

However, research published in 2003 has suggested that <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> possesses a unique crest, Olorotitan is Corythosaurus closest known relative. Benson et al. (2012) found that Corythosaurus was closely related to Velafrons, Nipponosaurus, and Hypacrosaurus, and said that they formed a group of fan-crested lambeosaurines.|$|E

5|$|Despite Riggs' publication, Henry Fairfield Osborn, who was {{a strong}} {{opponent}} of Marsh and his taxa, labeled the Apatosaurus mount of the American Museum of Natural History Brontosaurus.

Damage was mostly limited to trees and powerlines, but an F1 tornado in Macon county injured one man, destroyed an auto-repair shop, and damaged several nearby cars. About 35,000 residences in Alabama and 7,000 in both Florida and Mississippi were left without power following the storm.|$|E
