5|$|Phoenix {{contains}} HE0107-5240, possibly one of {{the oldest}} stars yet <b>discovered.</b> <b>It</b> has around 1/200,000 the metallicity that the Sun has and hence must have formed very early {{in the history of the}} universe. With a visual magnitude of 15.17, it is around 10,000 times dimmer than the faintest stars visible to the naked eye and is 36000 light years distant.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, a nova-like {{outburst}} {{was observed}} {{in the direction of}} the Andromeda galaxy by Ernst Hartwig in Estonia. S Andromedae increased to 6th magnitude, outshining the entire nucleus of the galaxy, then faded in a manner much like a nova. In 1917, George W. Ritchey measured the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy and <b>discovered</b> <b>it</b> lay much farther than had previously been thought. This meant that S Andromedae, which did not just lie along the line of sight to the galaxy but had actually resided in the nucleus, released a much greater amount of energy than was typical for a nova.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Barry Cunliffe decided {{to examine a}} single hill fort and its {{surrounding}} territory {{in an attempt to}} shed light on Iron Age society, its politics, and population. With the permission of the site's owner, Hampshire County Council, archaeological excavations began in 1969 and continued until 1988. Over the twentyseasons archaeologists spent examining the site, they looked at the defences and the gateway, and excavated 57% of the interior, where the remains of wattle and timber houses were <b>discovered.</b> <b>It</b> was the lengthiest investigation of any hill fort in western Europe.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Pallas has a moon. A moon about 1 kilometer in diameter was suggested based on occultation data from an occultation on 29 May 1978, and another one separated from Pallas by 750 kilometers and 175 kilometers in diameter itself was suggested in 1980, but later shown incorrect in 1983 occultation observations. Considering the level at which Pallas has been studied and observed since it was <b>discovered,</b> <b>it</b> is unlikely that there are any large moons orbiting Pallas.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-6 is {{a yellow}} giant {{situated}} in the constellation Cygnus.

The star, which is slightly larger, more metal-rich, slightly cooler, and more massive than the Sun, is orbited by at least one extrasolar planet, a Jupiter-sized planet named Kepler-6b that orbits closely to its star.|$|E
5|$|Limusaurus is {{the first}} {{definite}} ceratosaur from eastern Asia to be <b>discovered.</b> <b>It</b> {{is also one of}} the earliest members of the group Ceratosauria, living during the Oxfordian stage of the Jurassic period (approximately 161-157 million years ago). Its discovery shows that the Asian dinosaurian fauna was less endemic during the Middle/Late Jurassic period than previously thought, and suggests a possible land connection between Asia and other continents during that period.|$|E

5|$|Romani people drove {{steel or}} iron needles into a corpse's heart and placed bits of steel in the mouth, over the eyes, ears {{and between the}} fingers {{at the time of}} burial.

In a 16th-century burial near Venice, a brick forced into the mouth of a female corpse has been interpreted as a vampire-slaying ritual by the archaeologists who <b>discovered</b> <b>it</b> in 2006. In Bulgaria, over 100 skeletons with metal objects, such as plough bits, embedded in the torso have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} described in 1805 as Lycoperdon corium {{in the second}} volume of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's Flore Française. They attributed authorship to French botanist Louis Ben Guersent, who <b>discovered</b> <b>it</b> in an alfalfa field between the town of La Sotte and Rouen in northern France. Synonyms include Scleroderma corium published by Arthur Harmount Graves in 1830, and Steerbekia corium published by Elias Magnus Fries in 1849. The species was given its current name by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux in 1842, who circumscribed the genus Mycenastrum to contain it. Generic synonyms are Vassiliĭ Matveievitch Czernajew's 1845 Endonevrum and Stephan Schulzer von Müggenburg's 1876 Pachyderma.|$|E

5|$|Æthelberht (Old English: Æðelbrihte), {{also called}} Saint Ethelbert the King, (died 20 May 794 at Sutton Walls, Herefordshire) was an eighth-century saint and a king of East Anglia, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom which today {{includes}} the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk.

5|$|Before {{moving over}} the mountains, the 20th Division {{headquarters}} elected to destroy its cryptographic materials rather than carry them. As the wet weather made burning them page by page {{a slow and}} difficult process, and a fire might {{attract the attention of}} the Allied Air Forces, someone decided to simply bury them in a steel trunk in a stream bed. An Australian sapper checking the stream bed for booby traps with a metal detector <b>discovered</b> <b>it,</b> and it was dug up in the belief that it was a mine. An intelligence officer recognised the contents as code books and soon it {{was on its way to}} the Central Bureau in Brisbane. There, the pages were carefully dried out and photographed. On 4 February 1944, Central Bureau codebreakers decrypted a thirteen-part message that laid out the decisions reached at a conference of high-ranking Japanese officers. Copies of the material were quickly sent to Arlington Hall. In January 1944, Arlington Hall had decrypted 1,846 Japanese army messages. In March 1944, with the Sio code books in hand, it decrypted 36,000 messages.|$|E

The Maya prepared for battle but the Spanish horses and firearms quickly decided the outcome. The defeated Chontal Maya lords offered gold, food, clothing and a group of young women in tribute to the victors. Among these women was a young Maya noblewoman called Malintzin, who was given the Spanish name Marina. She spoke Maya and Nahuatl and became the means by which Cortés was able to communicate with the Aztecs. From Tabasco, Cortés continued to along the coast, and went on to conquer the Aztecs.|$|E

5|$|In 2003 and 2004, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{carried out}} two expeditions to Titanic.

The stern section, which had previously received relatively little attention from explorers, was specifically targeted for analysis.

On the way, they stopped in Hamburg, where they met the mayor, who proudly showed them a wonder of nature which he possessed: the taxidermied remains of a seven-headed hydra. Linnaeus quickly <b>discovered</b> <b>it</b> was a fake: jaws and clawed feet from weasels and skins from snakes had been glued together. The provenance of the hydra suggested to Linnaeus it had been manufactured by monks to represent the Beast of Revelation. As much as this may have upset the mayor, Linnaeus made his observations public and the mayor's dreams of selling the hydra for an enormous sum were ruined. Fearing his wrath, Linnaeus and Sohlberg had to leave Hamburg quickly.|$|E
