25|$|Undoubtedly, you Orleanians {{think of}} me as a most horrible murderer, which I am, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> much worse if I wanted to. If I wished, I could pay a visit to your city every night. At will I could slay {{thousands}} of your best citizens (and the worst), for I am in close relationship with the Angel of Death.|$|E

25|$|I {{would not}} wish to a dog or to a snake, to the most low and misfortunate {{creature}} of the earth, I would {{not wish to}} any of them what I have had to suffer for things that I am not guilty of. But my conviction is that I have suffered for things that I am guilty of. I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> reborn two other times, I would live again to do what I have done already.|$|E
25|$|Miguel Maria do Patrocinio de Bragança e Bourbon, {{the third}} (second surviving) son of King João VI and Carlota Joaquina, {{was born in}} the Queluz Royal Palace, Lisbon, and was created by his father Duke of Beja. Some sources have {{suggested}} that Miguel <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> the illegitimate son from an adulterous affair between his mother, Queen Charlotte, and one of her alleged lovers, possibly D. Pedro José Joaquim Vito de Meneses Coutinho, Marquis of Marialva. Apparently sources close to King João VI confirmed as much by asserting that he had not had sexual relations with his wife {{for two and a half}} years prior to Miguel's birth (a period when his parents carried out a conjugal war, during which they were involved in permanent conspiracies, and only encountered each other in rare official circumstances).|$|E

25|$|In the {{tried and}} true way of all major labels at the time, {{they really wanted to}} sign Dave but got a {{troublesome}} band instead. It was probably Island's insistence that Alsy and Marty weren't up to it that caused the Craig Leon sessions to be the unmitigated disaster that they were. Now <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> wrong here, maybe Craig wanted them out, maybe both. We were pretty much forced to let a couple of session guys stand in – no names because it wasn't their fault – and we could tell straight away that this was applying a straightener to the normally unruly quiff that was the band. It was also sucking the essence of the band out. Anyway, it's a sorry little interlude that I should draw the curtain on. The sessions were scrapped and we were allowed to be The Triffids again.|$|E
25|$|In August 2017, he {{was asked}} whether he might have {{acquired}} Greek citizenship through his mother, born in Greece, and British or Cypriot nationality through his father, an ethnic Greek {{who was born in}} Cyprus when it was a British colony and who possessed a British passport. He stated: “I’ve never had, never sought, never received citizenship of another country but out of an abundance of caution I wrote to the Greek embassy and Cypriot high commission saying essentially, ‘I’ve never been a citizen, I don’t want to be, so if there’s any question that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be,</b> I renounce any rights to be’. I don’t know what else I can do in the circumstances.” He added that he had not received replies to these enquiries. Later he said he had renounced Greek citizenship but, on finding he might be British, he had sought clarification from British authorities. On 19 August, he announced that British authorities had confirmed he is a British Overseas citizen, a lesser form of British nationality. He stated that he would not resign from the Parliament, but would await a High Court decision. Together with that of Nash, Xenophon's case was referred to the Court on 4 September.|$|E
