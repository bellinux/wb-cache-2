40|$|Space {{launcher}} vehicles {{consist of}} thin-walled shell structures which {{are prone to}} buckling and often are sensitive towards geometrical imperfections. Even small deviations of the shell from the perfect structure which still are within manufacturing tolerances, result in a tremendous decrease of load carrying capacity. To account for geometrical imperfections in an early design phase, empirical knock-down factors or theoretical approaches can be applied. In this paper, it is shown that the design of imperfection sensitive shell structures with unknown geometric imperfections may not lead to robust designs for the existing empirical and theoretical design methods. In contrast to unstiffened structures and grid stiffened shell structures, which are imperfection sensitive, {{it is known that}} the influence of imperfections during an early design phase of ring frame stringer stiffened shells is negligible when the post-buckling regime of the skin fields is exploited. Frame stringer stiffened structures can be designed in a robust manner, using efficient analysis methods, as imperfection tolerant structures; but, existing methods to size ring <b>frame</b> <b>stiffeners</b> of space launcher vehicles shell structures do not mandatorily lead to reliable and light designs. In this contribution a novel method for the efficient design of ring frame stringer stiffened shells is presented. The suggested approach is based on the explicit description of the mechanical behavior of the ring <b>frame</b> <b>stiffeners</b> at the onset of panel instability. Together with existing sizing methods for stringer stiffened shell panels the suggested approach allows for robust designs of ring frame stringer stiffened shells. The application of the novel method to size ring frames reveals that the minimum stiffness requirements are satisfied likewise with regard to existing methods; whereby, the lightweight potential is not mandatorily exploited using existing methods...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increased}} emphasis on reducing the cost of manufacturing composite structures, secondary bonding or co-curing is an attractive option to {{eliminate the need for}} mechanically fastened subassemblies. Many composite components in aerospace structures consist of flat or curved panels with co-cured <b>frames</b> and <b>stiffeners.</b> Out-of-plane loading such as internal pressure in a composite fuselage or out-of-plane deformations in compression-loaded post-buckled panel may lead to debonding of the <b>frame</b> or <b>stiffener</b> from the panel [1]. In polymer matrix composites, progressive type failures are often observed where catastrophic failure is generally preceded by constituent level damage accumulation. Some investigations efforts propose progressive failure algorithms aimed at capturing the progressive failure process from the initial to final failure [2]. The possibility of accurately predicting the damage and progressive failure in structures produced from composite materials is an important task in the design of lightweight structures. The interlaminar delamination fracture toughness of composite rib-stiffened-shell elements made of carbon/epoxy materials has been investigated. Double cantilever beam (DCB) tests and pull-off tests were carried out for this purpose. The knowledge of experimentally observed failure mechanisms is needed to determine the constituent ultimate strength from the micromechanics-based volume averaged stress value...|$|R

This approach, using damage tolerance techniques, has led to a relaxation in the requirement for repair, and consequently the number of repairs has been substantially reduced. In addition, advance techniques have been developed using resin infusion technology for the re-attachment of debonded <b>stiffener</b> <b>frames.</b> The structural element tests used to validate the damage tolerance philosophy will be examined and the resin-infusion repair method explained using a case study detailing its first successful application...|$|R

40|$|The Energy Finite Element Analysis (EFEA) {{has been}} {{utilized}} successfully for modeling complex structural-acoustic systems with isotropic structural material properties. In this paper, a formulation for modeling structures {{made out of}} composite materials is presented. An approach based on spectral finite element analysis is utilized first for developing the equivalent material properties for the composite material. These equivalent properties are employed in the EFEA governing differential equations for representing the composite materials and deriving the element level matrices. The power transmission characteristics at connections between members made out of non-isotropic composite material are considered for deriving suitable power transmission coefficients at junctions of interconnected members. These coefficients are utilized for computing the joint matrix {{that is needed to}} assemble the global system of EFEA equations. The global system of EFEA equations is solved numerically and the vibration levels within the entire system can be computed.

The highly loaded stiffeners are made from precured unidirectional carbon/epoxy rods and dry fiber preforms.

A full-scale segment of a graphite-composite intertank was designed and fabricated by an industry team and tested at NASA Langley Research Center as a part of the RLV technology development program. The intertank test component was approximately 3. 0 m long by 6. 7 m wide and included slightly less than a 90 deg section of a cylindrical intertank. The test article was fabricated using graphite-bismaelimide composite material and consisted of a hat-stiffened skin with five ring <b>frames.</b> The <b>stiffeners</b> were secondarily bonded to the panel skin and the ring frames were mechanically attached.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of lightweight blast mitigating materials to protect commercial aircraft structures against internal blast loading. Thin clamped aluminum test panels with rivet-attached <b>frame</b> and stringer <b>stiffeners</b> were used to represent {{a portion of the}} fuselage structure of a commercial aircraft. These reinforced test panels were pre-pressurized before blast loading to simulate typical in-flight loads experienced by a commercial aircraft due to cabin pressurization. Bare spherical explosive charges of C 4 were then detonated at a fixed distance from the outer surface of these pre-pressurized plates. A high-speed camera was used to determine the mechanism and time scale of failure propagation in the reinforced panels. Eleven unique combinations of blast mitigating linings were used in the testing. The specific explosive charge mass and standoff distance selected for this study was found to produce massive damage in unprotected test panels. Several tests with blast mitigating liners also showed complete destruction of the test panel, indicating the inadequacy of these protective compositions. In the end, it was determined that a blast liner comprised of a rigid outer layer, such as aluminum, in combination with an elastomeric backing layer was successful in preventing the rupture of the reinforced test panel. This material combination was found to be effective over several tests and with slight variations of the specific rigid and flexible materials used...|$|R
40|$|Designing a {{fuselage}} is a {{very complex}} process, which involves many different aspects like strength and stability, fatigue, damage tolerance, fire resistance, thermal and acoustic insulation but also inspection, maintenance, production and repair aspects. It is difficult to include all design aspects {{from the start of the}} design process. In this research it is tried to find an answer to the question whether a Multidisciplinary Design and Optimisation (MDO) approach will lead to a better (lighter) fuselage design compared to the normally practiced sequential approach. To find an answer to this question, a multidisciplinary design method is developed for fuselage design. Since fuselage design involves many aspects this research is restricted to the mechanical and the thermal and acoustic insulation aspects. Also the fuselage is simplified by excluding detail parts like windows and interior parts. In future research this could easily be extended by including more detail parts and considering other design aspects. The multidisciplinary design method of a fuselage is given shape in the form of a Design and Engineering Engine (DEE). The DEE is an engineering tool that consists out of different computer tools linked together. The central heart of the DEE is the Multi Model Generator (MMG), which is a flexible parametric description of the fuselage geometry. The MMG consists of building blocks from which any type of fuselage configuration can be constructed. The input to the MMG is the definition of the input parameters that define the fuselage configuration. The user can specify which input parameters will be used as design variables. The outputs of the MMG are the different input models and/or data for the different analysis modules. The current DEE has four analysis modules that are explained briefly: 1.) The structural analysis module can analyse two different structural concepts; the stiffened skin concept and the sandwich skin concept. The stresses are determined with FEM analysis and are evaluated with strength, buckling and wrinkling criteria depending on the structural concept. 2.) The acoustical analysis module, which determines the TL, consists out of three parts. The first part is based on literature equations translated into a MATLAB script. The literature equations cover all insulation concepts that are involved for a fuselage wall. The sound insulation concepts that are involved are the single skin, influence of <b>frames</b> and <b>stiffeners,</b> circular resonance effects, the double wall principle, insulation blankets and visco-elastic damping layers. The second part consists out of a FEM natural frequency analysis and a FEM steady state dynamic analysis to determine the natural frequencies and sound pressure differences over the fuselage wall. Since the second part is quite time consuming this part is only used for the final optimum solution, while the first part of the acoustic analysis module is used during the optimisation loop of the DEE. The third part consists out of an active noise control module using piezoelectric actuators. This part has been developed in cooperation with TNO TPD within the ‘Smart Panel’ project. Unfortunately this part is not fully operational because this project was terminated before the DEE could be linked to the active noise control, prediction algorithms developed by TNO TPD. 3.) The thermal insulation module performs a FEM transient heat analysis on the fuselage wall. The inside surface of the fuselage wall is heated by a constant heat flux. The FEM solution shows equilibrium for the temperature difference between the inside and outside surface of the fuselage wall after a period of time. The magnitude of the equilibrium temperature difference is a measure for the thermal insulation of the fuselage wall. 4.) The weight module uses the geometric dimensions and material properties to determine the weight of each part of the fuselage and sums these weights to the final fuselage weight. The genetic algorithm concept has been used to optimise the fuselage design. A Design Of Experiments (DOE) method is used to determine, with the DEE, a population of solutions. With this population, response surfaces are created that are used within the optimisation procedures. Validation calculations are performed with the DEE to check the optimum solution. If required a new population is created in the neighbourhood of the optimum solution to perform another optimisation step. Two fuselage concepts for medium sized civil aircraft have been analysed with the developed DEE; the stiffened skin and the sandwich skin concept. In the analyses, both fuselages concepts were exposed to the same load case and boundary conditions. For the given load and boundary conditions, the DEE showed that the sandwich fuselage concept is slightly lighter compared to the stiffened skin fuselage. When considering minimum weight as the design objective the DEE showed that the MDO solution lies close to the sequentially optimised fuselage. By using carbon/epoxy instead of aluminium, the largest weight improvement was achieved for the stiffened skin fuselage. These analyses showed that the multidisciplinary design method did not result in a drastically changed fuselage configuration. The literature equations used in the acoustic module for the influence of the frames and stringers on the sound transmission loss on cylinders suggest that increasing the frame and stringer pitch will improve the sound transmission loss of the fuselage wall. To validate this, sound pressure difference measurements have been performed on cylinder walls with different stiffening. The experiments involved a nonstiffened cylinder, a cylinder with 6 stringers, a cylinder with 12 stringers and a cylinder with 12 stringers and 2 frames. No exact comparison between the measurements and the literature equations could be made. Therefore it is concluded that the literature equations are only indicative. For more accurate predictions more research and experiments are required. The DEE proved to work successfully. It is a flexible knowledge engineering tool that easily can be extended with new analysis modules. In future work this tool could be updated with new analysis tools for more accurate calculations. In conclusion the MDO approach did not deliver spectacular weight savings compared to the normally practiced sequential approach. The reason for this is that the design aspects strength and stiffness and the thermal and acoustic insulation showed little correlation. Perhaps by including more design aspects like impact resistance and fatigue into the DEE more advantage can be achieved with the MDO approach.
