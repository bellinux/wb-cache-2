40|$|Using Tanzania {{as a test}} case, {{this study}} {{demonstrates}} how household survey data {{can be used to}} assess the impacts of public investments on growth and poverty. A two step procedure is used. First, household survey data are used to link household welfare measures to human capital and household access to infrastructure and technology, while controlling for other community and household characteristics. The second step links household human capital and access to infrastructure and technology to past public <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> these factors. As in the Asian studies, the growth effects (measured as per capita income) of <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> agricultural research, roads, and education are found to be large. But unlike Asia, no clear distinction emerges between the measured impacts for high and low potential areas. In many high potential areas, returns to investments are still high and {{there is no sign of}} any diminishing marginal returns. This suggests that there has been insufficient public <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> all <b>kinds</b> of regions. Nevertheless, the results show that there is opportunity to improve on the growth and poverty impacts of total public investment through better regional targeting of specific types of investment. For example, additional <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> rural education have attractive growth and poverty impacts in all regions, whereas additional <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> roads and agricultural research are better spent in the central and southern regions of the country.

This article presents {{a study of}} the upward pressure on regional electricity prices from nuclear power phase out in four scenarios with various levels of ambition to scale down the nuclear power industry. We use a global general equilibrium model to calculate regional electricity prices that are matching demand with the constrained power supply after the nuclear power phase out.

40|$|A growth {{model is}} {{presented}} in which productive government expenditure {{takes the form of}} a stock. Private and public capital interact with each other in two ways. The first is related to the specification of the aggregate production function (Cobb-Douglas vs. CES). The second has to do with the rates of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> the two types of capital, and arises from the law of motion of public capital. The share of public capital devoted to output production can be exogenous or endogenous. In this framework, we analyse how the optimal growth rate of the economy depends on the degree of complementarity/substitutability between the <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> the two <b>kinds</b> of capital, as well as on the elasticity of substitution between the two capital-inputs in the production of goods.

Due to the higher crime rate in these neighborhoods they often do not trust or care about one another. With lack of trust and care, these neighborhoods not only are economically inefficient, but the working poor do not have the adequate human network and support from their communities to escape poverty. Because many of the working poor do not have degrees or sufficient technical skills, it is difficult for them to obtain high paying jobs and lift themselves out of poverty.|$|R

Currently, the extent to which liquidity plays a role in determining breakeven inflation remains contentious. Information from the market for inflation swaps provides a range for the possible liquidity premium in TIPS, which in turn suggests a range for estimates of inflation expectations that is well below the widely followed Survey of Professional Forecasters inflation forecast. Measures of inflation expectations are important both for the conduct of monetary policy and for assessing its credibility.
