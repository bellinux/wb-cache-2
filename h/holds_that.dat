25|$|In Judaism, {{the day of}} {{judgment}} happens every year on Rosh Hashanah; therefore, the belief in a last day {{of judgment}} for all mankind is disputed.

5|$|The {{significance}} of medieval Islamic science has been debated by historians.

25|$|Within {{this broad}} definition, {{theories}} of spiritual evolution are very diverse.

They can be holistic (<b>holding</b> <b>that</b> higher realities emerge from and are not reducible to the lower), idealist (<b>holding</b> <b>that</b> reality is primarily mental or spiritual) or nondual (<b>holding</b> <b>that</b> there is no ultimate distinction between mental and physical reality).

5|$|Historians {{of science}} {{differ in their}} views of the {{significance}} of the scientific accomplishments in the medieval Islamic world. The traditionalist view, exemplified by Bertrand Russell, <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> Islamic science, while admirable in many technical ways, lacked the intellectual energy required for innovation and was chiefly important for preserving ancient knowledge, and handing it on to medieval Europe. The revisionist view, exemplified by Abdus Salam, George Saliba and John M. Hobson <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> a Muslim scientific revolution occurred during the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Donald Routledge Hill and Ahmad Y Hassan argue that Islam was the driving force behind these scientific achievements.|$|E
5|$|Ibn al-Ash'ath {{remained}} {{safe under}} the protection of the Zunbīl, but al-Hajjaj, fearing that he might raise another revolt, sent letters to the Zunbīl, mixing threats and promises, to secure his surrender. Finally, in 704 the Zunbīl gave in, in exchange for lifting the annual tribute for 7 or 10 years. Accounts of Ibn al-Ash'ath's end differ: one version <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> he was executed by the Zunbīl himself, or that he died of illness, and that his head was cut off and sent to al-Hajjaj. The more widespread account, however, <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> he was confined to a remote castle at Rukhkhaj in anticipation of his extradition to al-Hajjaj, and chained to his warden, but that he threw himself {{from the top of the}} castle (along with his warden) to his death.|$|E

In comparison to Bates's pygmy antelope, the royal antelope has a longer muzzle, broader lips, a smaller mouth and smaller cheek muscles. These features do not allow complete digestion of lignified growth. Individuals may often move into new locations foraging for fresh growth.|$|E
