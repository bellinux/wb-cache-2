50|$|Foot ferries {{are small}} craft used to ferry foot passengers, and often also cyclists, over rivers. These are either <b>self-propelled</b> <b>craft</b> or cable ferries. Such ferries are for example {{to be found}} on the lower River Scheldt in Belgium and in {{particular}} the Netherlands. Regular foot ferry service also exists in the capital of the Czech Republic, Prague, and across the Yarra River in Melbourne, Australia at Newport. Restored, expanded ferry service in the Port of New York and New Jersey uses boats for pedestrians only.|$|R
5000|$|The regatta {{was inaugurated}} in 1887, being {{described}} as an [...] "Aquatic Sports and Venetian Fete", although Alfred Sisley's painting illustrates a regatta in existence some thirteen years earlier at the same location. Pleasure boating on the River Thames between Teddington Lock and Molesey Lock had become extremely popular, and owners of <b>self-propelled</b> <b>craft</b> were interested in more sporting activity than just recreational boating, and competitors came from local sports clubs. The regatta was from the start under the royal patronage of Princess Frederica of Hanover who was then residing at Hampton Court Palace. The start point, then as now, was from the Hampton Court Palace Water Gallery, but finished then {{at the lower end}} of Boyle Farm Island.|$|R

50|$|Originally {{the parade}} {{featured}} flower-decorated horse carriages. Over time, floats built by volunteers from sponsoring communities supplanted the carriages. Currently most are built by professional float building companies and take {{nearly a year}} to construct. Some communities and organizational sponsors still rely on volunteers. The Valley Hunt Club still enters a flower-decorated carriage. The Cal Poly Universities Rose Float still relies solely on students who volunteer. <b>Floats</b> are <b>self-propelled</b> on (generally used-up) truck chassis {{in contrast to the}} Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade which uses trailer-based floats pulled by new, intact (sponsor-provided) trucks.|$|R

5|$|Nominally {{based in}} Alaska, the Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX-1) arrived on Ford Island in 2006 for {{maintenance}} and repairs and has returned several times since. Primarily used as a warhead-detection radar system on a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>floating</b> platform in the Pacific, its presence on the island has been controversial. The platform, with a cost reaching nearly , has never actually made it to Alaska and conspiracy theorists argue that the platform is a mobile version of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program.|$|R

During World War II USS ARD-18 {{was assigned to}} the Asiatic-Pacific Theater and serviced ships at Guadalcanal and Ulithi. After the war, ARD-18 was sent to Norfolk Shipbuilding and Drydock Corp.'s yard, circa 1967-68 and was lengthened by adding a 100 ft midsection as well as an additional deck above the uppermost crane deck. Redesignated Medium Auxiliary Repair Dry Dock Endurance (ARDM-3), she served until retirement in 1995.|$|R
50|$|On 1 June 1814, Barney's flotilla, led by his flagship, the 49 ft sloop-rigged, <b>self-propelled</b> <b>floating</b> battery USS Scorpion, {{mounting}} {{two long}} guns and two carronades, were coming down Chesapeake Bay when they encountered the 12-gun schooner HMS St. Lawrence (the former Baltimore privateer Atlas), and boats from the 74-gun Third Rates HMS Dragon and HMS Albion near St. Jerome Creek. The flotilla pursued St Lawrence and the boats {{until they could}} reach {{the protection of the}} two 74s. The American flotilla then retreated into the Patuxent River where the British quickly blockaded it.|$|R
50|$|Mobile Offshore Base (MOB), {{sometimes}} called a Joint Mobile Offshore Base (JMOB), {{is a concept}} for supporting military operations beyond the home shores, where conventional land bases are not available, by deploying {{on the high seas}} or in coastal waters, in-theater multipurpose floating base assembled from individual platforms. In essence, a MOB is a multipurpose modular <b>self-propelled</b> <b>floating</b> platform, or several interconnected platforms, that can perform multiple functions of a sea base including strike, deployment and logistics. An ocean-wise semi-submersible wave and wind resistant platform capable to move at one-half the speed of conventional prepositioning monohull cargo ship has been researched and proposed, but never built.|$|R
50|$|Joshua Barney {{submitted}} {{a plan for}} the defense of the Chesapeake Bay to Secretary of the Navy William Jones on 4 July 1813. He estimated that a force consisting of gunboats and barges that could be sailed or rowed, manned by sailors and those in the shipbuilding industries, could engage British landing parties in the shallow waters of the Bay. He set sail in April 1814 with these eighteen ships: seven 75 ft barges, six 50 ft barges, two gunboats, one row-galley, one lookout boat and his flagship, the 49 ft sloop-rigged, <b>self-propelled</b> <b>floating</b> battery USS Scorpion, mounting two long guns and two carronades.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{present the}} methodology, algorithms, system design, and {{experiments}} addressing the self-assembly of large teams of autonomous robotic boats into <b>floating</b> platforms. Identical <b>self-propelled</b> robotic boats autonomously dock to-gether and form connected structures with controllable variable stiffness. These structures can self-reconfigure into arbitrary shapes {{limited only by}} the number of rectangular elements assembled in brick-like patterns. An O(m 2) complexity algorithm automatically generates assembly plans which maximize opportu-nities for parallelism while constructing operator-specified target configurations with m components. The system further features an O(n 3) complexity algorithm for the concurrent assignment and planning of trajectories from n free robots to the growing structure. Such peer-to-peer assembly among modular robots compares favorably to a single active element assembling passiv...|$|R

2500|$|The {{ship was}} {{essentially}} a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>floating</b> dry dock with three main sections. The stern contained the engine, bridge, crew accommodations, workshops, pumps, electric generators and storage facilities for the submarine's torpedoes. The submarine's batteries were kept charged during the voyage by the current from the generators. The middle section consisted of a [...] double-hulled well deck with ballast tanks between its inner walls and the outer hull. The well deck had a capacity of [...] and was closed off {{by a pair of}} water-tight doors at its forward end. The outer plating and structural members of Kanguroos bow were designed to be partially dismantled to give access to the short tunnel through the bow to the well deck. Additional ballast tanks were positioned below and {{on each side of the}} tunnel to raise and lower the bow.|$|R
2500|$|On 28 June Beagle, {{together}} with the destroyers Bulldog, [...] and [...] escorted the cruiser [...] as she provided naval gun support to the advancing British and Indian troops during the Battle of Gully Ravine. The British made another attempt to break the stalemate at Gallipoli on 6–7 August 1915, with the Landing at Suvla Bay, {{to the north of}} Anzac Cove. This time, instead of row-boats, armoured shallow-draught <b>self-propelled</b> landing <b>craft</b> known as [...] "Beetles" [...] were used, which were towed close to shore by destroyers. While the main landing took place on Nibrunesi beach to the south of Sulva Bay, Beagle, {{together with}} Bulldog and [...] landed troops of the 34th Brigade in Sulva Bay itself. Each destroyer carried 500 troops aboard, while towing a [...] "Beetle" [...] carrying a further 500 troops. The [...] "Beetles" [...] would land their troops and then return to pick up the remaining troops on the destroyers and land them. While the landings on Nibrunesi beach went well, those in Sulva Bay were less successful, landing to the south of the planned place, with the result that the [...] "Beetles" [...] ran aground off shore, with the remaining troops aboard the destroyers having to be landed by reserve row boats. Beagles troops were not all landed until nearly 5:00 AM on 7 August, several hours late. Beagle helped to cover the evacuations from Anzac Cove on 20 December 1915.|$|R
5000|$|Inca {{was placed}} in the {{category}} [...] "grounded ships, salvage not warranted" [...] on 2 January 1946, and on 12 January 1946 ComServDiv 104 reported that the ship was no longer required, that an informal inspection indicated needed repairs were too extensive, and asked that she be returned to WSA. In turn, the Commander in Chief, Pacific (CINCPAC) asked CNO what disposition was desired for Inca. CNO's response of 15 January, [...] "above incorrect," [...] was probably the first clear indication received in the Pacific that the name and designation they had been using for this ship for the past five months were wrong. Back in early July 1945 the Navy had planned to take over another damaged Liberty ship, Henry L. Abbott, for <b>self-propelled</b> <b>floating</b> storage of lubricants and drummed petroleum products at Ulithi, and on 14 July SECNAV approved the name Gamage and designation IX-227 for the ex-Henry L. Abbott. On 21 July, however, CNO wrote to the War Shipping Administration and asked that his request of 13 July for the Henry L. Abbott be canceled, because her poor hull condition made her unsuitable for use as dry cargo floating storage. CNO had already advised CINCPAC a day earlier of the cancellation of Henry L. Abbott. The Navy later decided to shift the name Gamage and the designation IX-227 to the ex-William B. Allison and cancel the name and number given that ship on 6 August. This directive has not come to light in the archives, and the cryptic question sent to CINCPAC by CNO on 17 August, [...] "Request information re acceptances William B. Allison for Gamage (IX-227) in lieu of Henry L. Abbott" [...] appears to have gone unappreciated when CINCPAC on 24 August and again on 4 September reported the 30 July acceptance. The ex-William B. Allison was consistently called Inca in all reporting from the Pacific Theater through mid-January 1946, and a photograph of her ashore at Buckner Bay appears to show the hull number IX-229 painted on her bow.|$|R
