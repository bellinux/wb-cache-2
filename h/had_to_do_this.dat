25|$|In June 2012 {{a failure}} of an upgrade to payment {{processing}} software meant that a substantial proportion of customers could not transfer money to or from their accounts. This meant that RBS had to open a number of branches on a Sunday – {{the first time that}} they had <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E
25|$|Three {{airplanes}} on {{the tarmac}} at the Greater Buffalo International Airport in Cheektowaga were waiting to take off when the blizzard hit. One of them idled for five minutes due to the blizzard hitting; this resulted in the nose wheel freezing and preventing it from turning around. It took several hours to bring the three airplanes back to the terminal since they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> via radio communication. The limited visibility prevented the pilots from seeing {{the men on the}} ground who would normally guide the airplane.|$|E
25|$|It {{also must}} {{double as a}} clean room to {{preserve}} the science value of the samples. The problem here is that, while it {{is relatively easy to}} simply contain the samples once returned to Earth, researchers would also want to remove parts of the sample and use them in experiments. During all these handling procedures, the samples would need to be contained to prevent contamination of Earth. However {{at the same time the}} samples would need to be kept free from contamination by Earth micro-organisms and biological material; even a single amino acid of Earth origin could confuse the analysis. This introduces conflicting requirements. They surely can be reconciled but to date, no facility has <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> so new building requirements would need to be imposed.|$|E

25|$|Even {{with the}} {{addition}} of $800 million of state funds promised in 1978, {{less than half of the}} $600 million authorized in the 1967 bond issue for major construction had been spent. The MTA made improvements to tunnels, tracks, switches and signals. It <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> with a smaller amount of funding than available in the past due to the fiscal crisis, and keep the subway operating 24 hours a day. However, it had a major public relations problem. As people didn't see any improvements, they assumed that crime was out of control, and for a while it was, but this assumption was maintained even during periods of reduced crime. In an attempt to alleviate the crime situation and extend the service life of rolling stock, half-length trains began running during off-peak hours. Infrastructure was in such poor condition that even the 63rd Street and Archer Avenue subway projects were threatened by 1980. The 63rd Street Line was flooded with water, while the Archer Avenue Line could barely be built past Parsons Boulevard.|$|E

In the ten years that followed, women under investigation (i.e. not convicted) in Dnipropetrovsk oblast were either held in Preliminary Prison 4 in Kryvyi Rih or in [...] "detention blocks" [...] in Dnipropetrovsk; this contravened Ukrainian Law [...] "On preliminary incarceration". [...] Journeys from Kryviy Rih took up to six hours in special railway carriages with grated windows. [...] Some prisoners <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> 14 or 15 times. [...] After complaints by the ombudsman (Nina Karpacheva) {{the head of the}} State prison {{department of}} Ukraine (Vladimir Levochkin) arranged that finances were given for the provision of women's cells in Dnipropetrovsk Preliminary Prison, making the lives of the 15,000 unconvicted women-detainees easier from August 2000.|$|E

2500|$|In an April 2011 {{interview}} Lenihan {{claimed the}} European Central Bank forced Ireland into taking a bailout and rejected claims by a senior ECB figure {{that the bank}} warned Ireland in mid-2010 of the dangers it faced. He has also accused members of the ECB executives of briefing against Ireland and of [...] "betrayal". Lenihan criticised some of the 17 governing board members of the bank for the [...] "damaging" [...] {{manner in which they}} had briefed some media about Ireland. He said, [...] "On the betrayal issue, I did feel that some bank governors should not be speaking out of turn and that only the president should speak for the bank." [...] The position of the ECB on Ireland's seeking of assistance was {{different from that of the}} European Commission, said Mr. Lenihan. [...] "I don't think the commission were anxious to bounce member states into a programme. [...] "That was my strong impression from my discussions with Commissioner Rehn." [...] he said, adding that [...] "the ECB clearly subscribed to a different view." [...] He gave a graphic description of his feelings when the bailout talks were concluded. [...] "I've a very vivid memory of going to Brussels on the final Monday to sign the agreement and being on my own at the airport and looking at the snow gradually thawing and thinking to myself, this is terrible. No Irish minister has ever <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> before." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{first he}} entered {{belonged to a}} man whose chest was {{slightly}} affected for the first time. He was a stout man, about thirty-five years of age, and of temperate habits--took a little beer occasionally, but never exceeded; had a good appetite, but had caught cold frequently in consequence of having to go a considerable distance from the shaft's mouth to the changing-house while exhausted with hard work underground and covered with profuse perspiration. Often he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in wet weather and when bitterly cold winds were blowing--of late {{he had begun to}} spit blood.|$|E

30|$|In summary, {{teachers}} at school A centered mainly on development of social competencies {{by creating a}} positive and stimulating learning environment with help of peers.

60|$|With {{that he kept}} edging the {{schooner}} nearer in. He <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> quietly, for it was {{the trouble}} with these white men, and above all with the mate, that you could never be sure of them; {{they would all be}} sleeping sound, or else pretending, and if a sail shook, they would jump to their feet and fall on you with a rope’s end.

You may argue perhaps that that is untrue to the essential realities; all this array of machine and workshop, all this marshalled power and purpose, has been the creation of inventor and business organiser. But are we not a little too free with that word [...] "creation"? Falstaff was a [...] "creation" [...] perhaps, or the Sistine sibyls; there we have indubitably an end conceived and sought and achieved; but did these inventors and business organisers do more than heed certain unavoidable imperatives? Seeking coal they were obliged to mine in a certain way; seeking steel they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> and this and not that and that; seeking profit they had to obey the imperative of the economy.
