2500|$|Most USB-based <b>flash</b> <b>technology</b> {{integrates}} {{a printed}} circuit board with a metal tip, which is simply soldered on. As a result, the stress point is where the two pieces join. The quality control of some manufacturers does not ensure a proper solder temperature, further weakening the stress point. Since many flash drives stick out from computers, {{they are likely to be}} bumped repeatedly and may break at the stress point. Most of the time, a break at the stress point tears the joint from the printed circuit board and results in permanent damage. However, some manufacturers produce discreet flash drives that do not stick out, and others use a solid metal uni-body that has no easily discernible stress point. [...] SD cards serve as a good alternative to USB drives since they can be inserted flush.|$|E

40|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>technologies</b> {{are rapidly}} {{improving}} {{in terms of}} bandwidth and latency. In this paper, we consider incorporating <b>flash</b> <b>technologies</b> at various levels in the existing architecture. For each level, we estimate the access time considering different levels of concurrency. We speculate on how highly concurrent programs might benefit from the incorporation of flash into the architecture. We aim to reduce operating system complexity by integrating some memory management functions with the proposed architecture. Finally, we also predict architectural changes that would become feasible if the trend in reducing latencies and improving bandwidth continues. 1...|$|R
