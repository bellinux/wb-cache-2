2500|$|For {{model year}} 1977, the full sized Pontiacs {{received}} the same [...] "downsizing" [...] as GM's other [...] "B" [...] body cars. The new Bonnevilles and Catalinas continued to be best-sellers, although their styling similarity to the Chevrolet Caprice was seen by some buyers as a [...] "cheapening" [...] of Pontiac's image. In 1981, the full-size Bonneville was discontinued, the name reassigned to the [...] "A" [...] body <b>intermediate</b> <b>platform.</b> That left the Catalina as the only big Pontiac, further reducing sales as buyers went for more plushness.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, Ford {{introduced}} another {{similar but}} simpler vehicle, the Ford Mustang, {{as well as}} a new market segment, the pony car. This vehicle and it's contemporaries were also based on a generic live rear axle <b>intermediate</b> <b>platform</b> given distinctive styling features and room for just four passengers. Competitors included American Motors' 1965 Marlin, Dodge's 1966 Charger [...] The Filling in the Ford range was the 1967 Mercury Cougar based on a stretched Ford Mustang platform, with focus on luxury and distinguishing styling features such as hidden headlamps and sequential rear turn signal lamps. In 1967, GM introduced the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro.|$|E
2500|$|The new intermediate-based 1969 Grand Prix {{began to}} take shape in April 1967, with a few {{prototype}} models built on the full-sized Pontiac platform before the G-Body was ready. To save both development costs and time in much the same manner Ford created the original 1964 Mustang using the basic chassis and drivetrain from the compact Falcon, the revised Grand Prix would have a unique bodyshell but share the A-body <b>intermediate</b> <b>platform</b> and mechanicals with the Tempest, Le Mans and GTO. This reduced development time from the usual 36months required for a new model to less than 18, allowing Pontiac to concentrate upgrading styling and interior appointments.|$|E
50|$|The line commences at the Illawarra Junction {{south of}} Redfern station, the {{junction}} {{point of the}} Illawarra railway line. The line consists of three pairs of electrified tracks, six in total, which head west through the Inner Western suburbs of Sydney to Strathfield. The tracks are named 'Up' and 'Down' Main', 'Up' and 'Down' Suburban, and 'Up' and 'Down' Local. The 'Main' lines are express lines which have no <b>intermediate</b> <b>platforms</b> between Redfern and Strathfield, and usually carry Intercity, Interstate, Heritage, or express suburban trains. The inner 'Suburban' pair of tracks have some <b>intermediate</b> <b>platforms</b> and generally carry express or limited stops suburban train services (usually North Shore, Northern & Western Line suburban services). The southernmost 'Local' pair of tracks have <b>platforms</b> at all <b>intermediate</b> stations and carry all-stations and some limited stops services (usually Airport, Inner West & South Line suburban services).|$|R
50|$|Between 2004 and 2005 the {{platforms}} at {{the station}} underwent extensive modernisation. For a total of 3.2 million euros, two new prefabricated outer platforms were built, which were sited a platform length towards the direction of Würzburg. A new underpass was built to act as access for the platforms. The old home and <b>intermediate</b> <b>platforms</b> were removed following {{the completion of the}} new ones in July 2005.|$|R
50|$|Most qanats in Iran run {{less than}} 5 km, while {{some have been}} {{measured}} at ~70 km in length near Kerman. The vertical shafts usually range from 20 to 200 meters in depth, although qanats {{in the province of}} Khorasan have been recorded with vertical shafts of up to 275 m. The vertical shafts support construction and maintenance of the underground channel as well as air interchange. Deep shafts require <b>intermediate</b> <b>platforms</b> to simplify the process of removing soil.|$|R

50|$|Conversion {{of biomass}} to biofuel {{can also be}} {{achieved}} via selective conversion of individual components of biomass. For example, cellulose {{can be converted to}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>platform</b> chemical such a sorbitol, glucose, hydroxymethylfurfural etc. These chemical are then further reacted to produce hydrogen or hydrocarbon fuels.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{markets with}} search and with switching costs. It provides insights in several important issues in search markets, including how loss aversion may affect consumer behavior and firm conduct, and how prices, welfare, and profits may change when an <b>intermediating</b> <b>platform</b> orders sellers {{based upon the}} preferences of consumers. The thesis also advances our understanding {{of what happens in}} markets with switching costs when firms can make retention offers to potential switchers, and how the first step of partner switch in the marriage market, infidelity, may relate to impatience...|$|R
50|$|No {{information}} can be given on the station’s original tracks and platforms. After the expansion around 1909, the station had two <b>intermediate</b> <b>platforms.</b> The passengers {{had access to the}} island platforms via an underpass. The baggage was carried in a luggage transfer tunnel under the main tracks. There was access to the underpass and the luggage lift at the entrance building. The remains of the entrances to the island platforms can still to be seen on the railway side of the station building. The station originally did not have a platform next to the station building and the tracks next the station building were used for bank engines and for access to the goods shed.|$|R
50|$|The {{expanding}} specialty car demand, {{including the}} pony car, also influenced {{the development of}} personal sports models such as the fastbacked American Motors' 1965 Marlin, Dodge's 1966 Charger, and Mercury's Cougar in 1967. Both the Marlin and Charger {{were based on a}} generic <b>intermediate</b> <b>platform</b> given distinctive styling features and room for just four passengers.|$|E
5000|$|For 1973, the GM A-body <b>intermediate</b> <b>platform</b> was {{completely}} redesigned and the separate wheelbase {{used by the}} Vista Cruiser and Buick Sport Wagon eliminated; all A-body wagons were now built on the 116-inch sedan wheelbase. While its Buick counterpart was discontinued, the Vista Cruiser was redesigned as a woodgrained version of the new Cutlass Supreme station wagon. Despite the shortened wheelbase, three-row seating returned, with the third row facing rearward.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in 1966, the Comet {{grew from}} a compact {{to become a}} mid-sized car. It was now {{based on the same}} chassis as the Ford Fairlane {{intermediate}} (and the previous Mercury Meteor intermediate which was only offered in 1962-1963). These intermediate-sized cars used the same basic chassis as the original Ford Falcon and Mercury Comet compacts, but were stretched with longer wheelbases. The previous generation Comet shared its platform with the all-new Ford Mustang in 1964, and when the Comet graduated to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>platform,</b> the Mercury Cougar became the platform shared with the Mustang.|$|E
50|$|There were no <b>intermediate</b> <b>platforms</b> or sidings and the {{terminus}} had a 212 feet brick platform on the Up {{side with}} a low iron building, being situated some 12 chains before reaching the site of Queen's Wharf platform of later years. There was a run-round loop, 450 feet in length, and a dead-end dock siding at the terminal end. The brickwork of the dock is still visible near the large quarry, from which the stone for the many fine buildings in the town was taken. A siding turned away towards the river bank rising on an embankment thence to trestling crossing over the extension of Steamer Street and terminating in coal staiths at the Queen's Wharf.|$|R
5000|$|Max Wedge {{cars are}} an {{essential}} part of automotive history as they are the first vehicles that can be classified as [...] "muscle cars" [...] by the strict definition as an intermediate-bodied car with a big-block motor. While both General Motors and Ford introduced <b>intermediate</b> <b>platforms</b> the same year, it was not until later that they outfitted their newly sized cars with big blocks. The 1962 413 Max Wedge Dodges and Plymouths preceded the 427 Ford Fairlane Thunderbolt (1964) and 390/427 Ford Fairlane (1966), 389 Pontiac GTO (1964), 396 Chevrolet Chevelle (1965), 400 Buick Gran Sport (1965), 400 Oldsmobile 442 (1965), and 427 Mercury Comet Cyclone (1964) and 390 Mercury Cyclone (1966).|$|R
30|$|In general, {{hierarchical}} {{structures are}} more prevalent among the providers than <b>intermediate</b> <b>platforms</b> [37]. This {{could possibly be}} linked to the reach/ scope hypothesis touched upon in Sect.  3.3. A possible explanation may be, considering that the data market is mainly a B 2 B market, that hierarchical relationships are easier to implement which is a favorable feature in a B 2 B market. Also, private customers tend to have a lower willingness to pay for data [25]. The observations hint that the data market is developing towards a mainstream market also targeting non-technical companies and users: a high number of providers offer several access possibilities but limit the number of data formats. The restriction to mostly standard formats such as reports or CSV files probably aims to reduce the presuppositions for data usage.|$|R

50|$|For the 1979 model year, {{the success}} found by GM and the {{upcoming}} introduction of smaller full-size cars by Ford necessitated {{a response from}} Chrysler. As a replacement for the C-platform redesigned in 1974, the company introduced the R-body vehicles. Unable {{to develop a new}} design from the ground up, Chrysler was relegated to reworking its existing 1962-1978 <b>intermediate</b> <b>platform.</b> The R-series wore comparable dimensions as its Ford and General Motors competition. By the end of the 1981 model year, poor sales of all four R-body cars (Newport/New Yorker/Gran Fury/St. Regis) outside of fleet markets forced its discontinuation.|$|E
50|$|Reports {{indicate}} the train, {{which was not}} scheduled to stop, crashed at 137 km/h (below the speed limit of 150 km/h) and split in two between {{the fourth and fifth}} carriages after they derailed on a double slip. The rear of the train deviated to the left from Track 1 to Track 3 at the following railroad switch. The sixth carriage moved laterally between the two tracks and swept the <b>intermediate</b> <b>platform,</b> being pierced by a roof beam. The fifth carriage first hit the platform on its left and came to rest along the opposite platform.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{there was}} a plan to build an <b>intermediate</b> service <b>platform</b> to the {{pipeline}} to tie in future compression facilities and to enable the pipeline to be pigged in two sections. However, due to technological development {{it is possible to}} serve the pipeline as one pigging segment and the need for the service platform was eliminated.|$|R
40|$|Crowdsourcing - a {{neologism}} {{created from}} the words 'crowd' and 'outsourcing' - describes giving tasks {{to the crowd}} for completion. The use cases for crowdsourcing are diverse, and new ideas are constantly emerging on the internet, making {{it all the more}} important for companies to engage with the topic and {{to learn how to use}} it effectively. Various formats of crowdsourcing projects are used depending on the purpose and the initiator of the project, such as <b>intermediate</b> <b>platforms,</b> free solutions, corporate platforms, and marketplaces. The crowdsourcing process is divided into five stages, which consist of preparation, initiation and implementation of the project, and the evaluation and utilization of the ideas collected. Each step is associated with particular challenges and needs to be managed so that crowdsourcing can be used successfully as a problem-solving tool. Aside from the process-related factors, a good understanding of the web 2. 0 culture, professional preparation, and a clear understanding of the goals and responsibilities are the fundamental cornerstones of successful crowdsourcing projects...|$|R
25|$|Sales of Grand Prixs for the 1974 {{model year}} dropped from 1973's record of around 150,000units to just under 100,000units {{primarily}} due to new competition in the intermediate personal-luxury car market from a new upsized Mercury Cougar XR-7 coupe and Ford Elite, both based on the Dearborn's <b>intermediate</b> Torino/Montego <b>platform.</b> Still, 1974 was the third best-selling year to date for the Pontiac Grand Prix.|$|R
5000|$|The Falcon {{name was}} {{transferred}} from Ford's now discontinued, in the US, compact to a basic, even lower-trim {{version of the}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>platform</b> as a [...] "1970½" [...] model on January 1, 1970. This series included a two-door sedan which was not available in the higher trim lines. For 1971, the Falcon and Fairlane 500 names were dropped, as all of the intermediate models took the Torino name. The Falcon and Fairlane names continued {{to be used in}} Australia through to the 21st century. The Fairlane name continued to be used in Venezuela through 1978 on corresponding Ford Torino and LTD II models.|$|E

50|$|The cover art for Tempest {{incorporates}} a dark red duotone {{photograph of a}} statue located {{at the base of}} the Pallas-Athene Fountain in front of the Austrian Parliament Building in Vienna. The statue is one of four figures on the <b>intermediate</b> <b>platform</b> of the fountain bowl personifying the main rivers of Austria-Hungary: the Danube, the Inn, the Elbe, and the Moldau. The figure shown on the album cover represents the Moldau. The sculpture was created by Carl Kundmann between 1893 and 1902 based on architect Theophil Hansen's original plans. The photograph was taken by Alexander Längauer from his Shutterstock portfolio, and the package was designed by Coco Shinomiya. As with all Dylan albums of the past 15 years, the packaging features minimal credits and no printed lyrics.The deluxe limited edition CD includes a 60-page notebook of rare vintage magazines with Bob Dylan on frontcover. The covers are from the collections of Magne Karlstad and Oddbjørn Saltnes.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages {{a large number}} of butter-churn towers were erected in the Middle Rhine-South Hesse-Taunus region. Examples include those in Bad Homburg (the [...] "White Tower"), Friedberg (the Adolfsturm), Idstein (the [...] "Witches' Tower" [...] and the bergfried of Idstein Castle) and Oberwesel (the [...] "Oxen Tower"). The Marksburg above Braubach am Rhein had a square bergfried to which was added a small butter-churn turret in 1468. This burned down in 1705 and was {{replaced}} in 1905. One of the tallest towers is the 56-metre-high Round Tower, the symbol of the town of Andernach, which dates to 1453 and has an unusual variation: an octagonal upper turret with a stone gable roof. The highest bergfried of a hill castle with a butter-churn top (1370) was that of Rheinfels Castle above Sankt Goar am Rhein which was 54 metres high at the <b>intermediate</b> <b>platform,</b> but was destroyed in 1797. The third-highest surviving bergfried in Germany is at the Osterburg near Weida in Thuringia; it is 53 metres high and also designed as a butter-churn tower. It {{is also one of the}} oldest surviving bergfrieds, dating to 1193. It measures 24 metres to the platform and has an octagonal, stone conical roof dating to the 15th century.|$|E
50|$|Between 2012 and 2014, {{the group}} of halls {{dedicated}} to World War I was completely converted, modernised, and redesigned. To enlarge the initial exhibition area from 1,000 to 1,400 m², the room height was reduced and an <b>intermediate</b> <b>platform</b> was introduced, so that the entire exhibition now spreads over three levels. As {{a result of these}} measures, some 2,000 items relating to World War I are now accessible to the public, about twice as many as were on display in the previous exhibition.A series of display cabinets contain the uniforms, weapons, and equipment of the warring powers. At the beginning of the exhibition, the themes focus on the mobilization of the troops in the summer of 1914, the Austrian infantry, followed by the cavalry. Next on display are uniforms and arms of the opposing parties, the Kingdom of Serbia, the Russian Empire, and the Kingdom of Italy, which declared war on Austria-Hungary in 1915. This led to the so-called Italian Front of 1915-1918, to which a separate area is dedicated to in the exhibition. A particular exhibit is the 7-cm M 1899 mountain gun which was positioned around the Ortler summit at an altitude of 3,850 meters, making it Europe's highest gun emplacement. Apart from the weapons, uniforms, and military equipment items, the exhibition also thematizes other related material in separate areas, such as women in war, the k.u.k. military justice system, escape and displacement, deprivation and propaganda, injury and emergency medical services, religion, war captivity, disability and death. Hundreds of digital images and films are presented on flat screens.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{the project of}} {{replacing}} the steel roof construction and the outside fire staircase with elevator of the UL FGG building on Hajdrihova street. First we determine the loads for the roof and the fire staircase. Then we make a 3 D model in the program Steel Engineer in order to calculate the internal forces. For the main structure of the roof we select the frame {{in one direction and}} frame with centric bracing in other direction. The fire staircase has four internal columns and four external columns around which vertical bracing is placed. Between internal and external columns there are stairs with <b>intermediate</b> <b>platforms.</b> In this project we make the ultimate limit state analysis and seismic analysis for both designs. The seismic analysis is performed using a simplified method of horizontal forces. At roof seismic analysis is used to design vertical bracings and to design the rest of the elements we use the ultimate limit state analysis. At fire staircase seismic analysis is used to design columns, beam and vertical bracings and the ultimate limit state analysis is used {{for the rest of the}} elements. In both cases we also design joints and draw the position and detail plans...|$|R
