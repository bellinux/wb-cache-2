Considering the lack of technology, the lackof experience in fisheries management, and in surveillanceand enforcement capabilities, it is considered that regional as well as international arrangements are required. Such arrangements are discussed as possible approaches to problems created by the new regime. The development of fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of Western Samoa is also discussed. It is suggested that the development strategy to be taken is one which gives priority to the expansion and improvement of the inshore fishery to areas further offshore, while at the same time gaining maximum benefit from the offshore resources. The fishing industry in Western Samoa is described and employed as a background for this study...|$|E
40|$|Together with cost {{inflation}} and stagnant market prices, the new 200 -nautical-mile regime {{has hit the}} conventional tuna and skipjack fishing industry very hard. Japanese countermeasures consist of domestic adjustments such as cost and risk-reducing devices, withdrawals of fishing vessels, employment of purse-seine fisheries, nearshore fishing ground adjustments, and demand expansion; and external strategies such as historical fishing rights, legal-Informal <b>Composite</b> <b>Negotiating</b> <b>Text</b> (ICNT), and bilateral arrangements. The Japanese claim on historical tuna and skipjack fishing rights in the EEZs and archipelagic waters of coastal states in Southeast Asia and the western central Pacific is based on 1) discovery of the fishing grounds by the Japanese, 2) risk-taking for development by the Japanese, 3) continuous and habitual Japanese fishing activities in the region, 4) long legal practices under the Japanese fisheries licensing system, and 5) {{the importance of the}} fishery. Although most coastal nations in Southeast Asia and the western central Pacific treat tuna and skipjack in their EEZs as their national properties, the position of the ICNT emphasizes that highly migratory species such as tuna and skipjack are managed by cooperation among the countries concerned and international cooperation is essential to manage those fishery wisely. Bilateral arrangements such as fee fishing and joint-ventures, associated with overseas cooperation, have been successful in terms of fishing access to the EEZs and archipelagic waters of coastal states in the region, but current arrangements become increasingly difficult due to coastal nations' desires to increase fishing fees and take part in joint-ventures. Emergence of subregional management schemes will become more important for dealing with highly migratory species like tuna and skipjack, but Japan is not yet ready for such schemes. The legal, political, and economic constraints on each of the strategies are numerous and combine to aggravate the problem. Although the Japanese government has committed to easing the adjustment of Japanese fishermen to the new ocean regime, the job is not easy. The problem involves not only the Japanese, but also coastal, resource-owning nations as well. Joint arrangements have many advantages over attempts by any one nation to go it alone. However, in order to arrive at successful arrangements, it is essential for each party to understand the interests, capabilities, and limitations of the other. A new international cooperation toward sound tuna and skipjack management can emerge only if each sets reasonable goals and recognizes a gradual growth process while seeking benefits for the welfare of both...|$|R

40|$|The present thesis {{examines}} Palestinian-Israeli peace initiatives {{as politically}} <b>negotiated</b> <b>texts</b> and their different Arabic, English and Hebrew language versions. Its {{aim is to}} make a contribution to {{a deeper understanding of the}} role of translation and recontextualization of politically <b>negotiated</b> <b>texts</b> in situations of ongoing contemporary conflict. In modern Translation Studies, although research exists on the translation of political texts following functional (e. g. Schäffner 2002) or systemic-linguistic (e. g. Calzada-Pérez 2001) approaches or applying narrative theory (Baker 2006), peace initiatives and politically <b>negotiated</b> <b>texts</b> are still a largely under-researched genre of political texts. The thesis – which takes 31 Arabic, English and Hebrew language versions of 5 different Palestinian-Israeli peace initiatives as its corpus – operates within the framework of product-oriented Descriptive Translation Studies (Lambert and Van Gorp 1985) and Critical Discourse Analysis (Fairclough 1992). For all of the peace initiatives analysed, there exist several language versions which were made available in different contexts by different institutions and for different readerships and purposes. The thesis pursues a top-down approach. It begins with presenting the socio-cultural and political contexts of the production of the original versions of the respective peace initiatives (the source texts) and their different language versions (target texts), focusing on their underlying functions and principles of audience design. It then moves to examine how the textual profiles of the language versions of peace initiatives reflect aspects of ideology, political affiliation and power relations at both the macro- and micro-structural levels. The final step is to account for these aspects in terms of socio-political and institutional conditions of the production of the translations. The overall textual analysis demonstrates that when translated, peace initiatives can be interpreted differently by different institutions in their attempt to promote their respective political interests and narratives. Also, it is very frequently that translations produced in one specific institutional context are recontextualised for use in another one. Such recontextualisation goes hand in hand with further textual amendments. To summarize, the thesis demonstrates how these translations – as products – are (re) framed and (re) contextualized in different institutional settings in order to serve different purposes. These texts, thus, play different roles in situations of ongoing contemporary conflict depending on the institutional context in which they are presented and the purposes they set to serve. These main findings make an original contribution to the discipline of Translation Studies in respect of emphasizing the need to study translations in their socio-political, historical and institutional contexts...|$|R

30|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing need to address loss and damage as a result of climate change through {{international}} processes. At the most recent November 2013 international climate change talks in Warsaw, 194 countries negotiated the best way to establish institutional arrangements for loss and damage under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Such a decision to establish these arrangements was made in 2012 in Doha in a decision known as the “Doha Gateway.” While the 19 th (2013) Conference of the Parties succeeded in delivering the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage Associated with Climate Change Impacts, there was concern by some negotiators earlier into the conference that this would never transpire given the staunch disagreements between countries and lobbying blocks on a way forward. This article provides a brief historical overview of loss and damage at the climate change talks, and examines the key discourses defining this issue between 2011 and 2013 by analyzing submissions by lobbying blocks and member countries, and final <b>negotiated</b> <b>texts.</b> These discourses revolve around causality and solutions, compensation, and the relationship between loss and damage and adaptation.|$|R
3000|$|In {{an attempt}} to address these realities, discourses around loss and damage have {{unfolded}} at the climate change talks.

It took until 2007 at COP 13 in Bali for such concern to find its way into a <b>negotiated</b> <b>text</b> at the climate change talks. As outlined in the Bali Action Plan, parties are to support: “Enhanced action on adaptation, including, inter alia, consideration of… (iii) Disaster reduction strategies and means to address loss and damage associated with climate change impacts in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change…” (UNFCCC 2007, p. 4). While there was recognition that climate change would cause loss and damage—constituting somewhat of a watershed moment—there was no mention of compensation or liability, which according to Warner and Zakieldeen (2011, p. 3) is language that causes widespread “discomfort for industrialized countries.” [...]...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{assessments}} have robustly linked {{stabilization of}} global-mean temperature {{rise to the}} necessity of limiting {{the total amount of}} emitted carbon-dioxide (CO 2). Halting global warming thus requires virtually zero annual CO 2 emissions at some point. Policymakers have now incorporated this concept in the <b>negotiating</b> <b>text</b> for a new global climate agreement, but confusion remains about concepts like carbon neutrality, climate neutrality, full decarbonization, and net zero carbon or net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here we clarify these concepts, discuss their appropriateness to serve as a long-term global benchmark for achieving temperature targets, and provide a detailed quantification. We find that with current pledges and for a likely (> 66 %) chance of staying below 2 °C, the scenario literature suggests net zeroCO 2 emissions between 2060 and 2070, with net negative CO 2 emissions thereafter. Because of residual non-CO 2 emissions, net zero is always reached later for total GHG emissions than for CO 2. Net zero emissions targets are a useful focal point for policy, linking a global temperature target and socio-economic pathways to a necessary long-term limit on cumulative CO 2 emissions...|$|R

Technological advances enabled the Victorians to adorn with images the pages of their books and the walls of their homes. But this was not a wholly visual culture.

Illustrations in Victorian publications and the narrative scenes that lined the walls of the Royal Academy reveal the Victorians' ideas about the world in which they lived and their notions of gender, class, and race.

Construction is an industry that is labour intensive, highly regulated and a significant adopter of the latest technology. The link between climate change and the labour market was recognised by the governments and others when they included provision for a “just transition” in the <b>negotiating</b> <b>text</b> for the now unrealised United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Agreement for COP 15.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to offer an {{in-depth}} analysis of the different legal aspects of international framework agreements (IFAs) negotiated between multinational companies and global union federations. Using examples from different agreements, the article shows the potential added value IFAs have in contributing to an effective social regulation within international groups and global supply chains that are today regulated insufficiently by national, European and international labour law standards. It also analyses the impact of the international negotiation process of the IFAs and the powers of the signatory parties on the legally binding character of these texts. To conclude, the article discusses the potential added value of an optional legal framework for IFAs. Between 2000 and 2007, about 50 international framework agreements (hereafter IFAs) have been negotiated in the field of corporate social responsibility (hereafter CSR) between multinational companies and international trade union federations to define labour standards for the workers of the company, its subsidiaries and in many cases, of its subcontractors (see table 1 for a list of existing IFAs). The development of this form of social regulation (Drouin, 2005; Daugareilh, 2005 a; for a historical approach: Descolonges, 2006) is linked to two converging interests.
