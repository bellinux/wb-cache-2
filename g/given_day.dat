An average of 38,000vehicles used the western section of M-8 along Davison Avenue in 2007 each day; the eastern segment carried 37,300vehicles. The section of freeway in between carried in excess of 50,000 vehicles a day in 2007 between M-10 and I-75. Of this traffic, 1,900trucks and other commercial vehicles used the trunkline.|$|E

5|$|M-80 has {{not been}} listed on the National Highway System (NHS) by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). The NHS is a network of {{highways}} important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. MDOT's annual surveys of the traffic counts are used to compute a value called the annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a measurement {{of the number of}} vehicles on a road for any <b>given</b> <b>day</b> of the year. The survey from 2009 showed that 2,803vehicles used the western section between I-75 and Gaines Highway, with 61trucks included in the count. The eastern section was used by 1,657vehicles and 61trucks.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the highway}} is listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads that are {{important}} to the nation's economy, defense and mobility.

The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) also computed the number of commercial vehicles in the 2009 survey and found that the highway was used by 120–163commercial trucks each day on average.|$|E
5|$|Route98 is {{maintained}} by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), an Illinois state agency responsible for maintaining highways and other transport infrastructure in the state.

In 2009, IDOT estimated that 4400vehicles used the western portion of Route98, 3900 used the central portion, and 3700 used the eastern portion. No part of Route98 is included in the National Highway System, a network of roads considered significant to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a variety}} of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather {{warnings}} are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a <b>given</b> <b>day.</b> Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them. In 2014, the US spent $5.1 billion on weather forecasting.|$|E
5|$|While the {{individual}} diver cannot predict exactly at what depth {{the onset of}} narcosis will occur on a <b>given</b> <b>day,</b> the first symptoms of narcosis for any given diver are often more predictable and personal. For example, one diver may have trouble with eye focus (close accommodation for middle-aged divers), another may experience feelings of euphoria, and another feelings of claustrophobia. Some divers report that they have hearing changes, and that the sound their exhaled bubbles make becomes different. Specialist training may help divers to identify these personal onset signs, which may then {{be used as a}} signal to ascend to avoid the narcosis, although severe narcosis may interfere with the judgement necessary to take preventive action.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} non-repeating calendar, the Maya {{measured}} time from a fixed start point. The Maya set {{the beginning of}} their calendar as the end of a previous cycle of bak'tuns, equivalent to a day in 3114 BC. This was believed by the Maya to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form. The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any <b>given</b> <b>day</b> of the Calendar Round within their current great Piktun cycle consisting of either 20 bak'tuns. There was some variation in the calendar, specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the piktun cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13 bak'tuns, and other inscriptions seem to have used an exceptional cycle of 13 + 20 bak'tun in the current piktun. Additionally, there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed.|$|E

5|$|Both the Zygalski-sheet {{method and}} each bomba worked {{for only a}} single {{scrambler}} rotor order, so six sets of Zygalski sheets and six bomby were produced. However, the Germans introduced two new rotors on 15 December 1938, giving a choice of three out of five to assemble in the machines on a <b>given</b> <b>day.</b> This {{increased the number of}} possible rotor orders from 6 to 60. The Biuro could then only read the small minority of messages that used neither of the two new rotors. They did not have the resources to produce 54 more bomby or 54 sets of Zygalski sheets. Fortunately, however, the fact that the SD network was still using the old method of the same indicator setting for all messages, allowed Rejewski to re-use his previous method of working out the wiring within these rotors. This information was essential for the production of a full set Zygalski sheets which allowed resumption of large-scale decryption in January 1940. On 1 January 1939, the Germans made military Enigma even more difficult to break by increasing the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight, to between seven and ten.|$|E
5|$|Hospice is a {{competitive}} business. In any given service area, {{there may be}} hundreds of different non-profit and commercial providers. Hospices can be small community-based operations, part of regional and national corporations, or part of a hospital or other health system. Data from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization indicated that in 2008 58.3% of hospice agencies were independent, with 20.8% based in hospitals, 19.7% geared for home health care and 1.3% in conjunction with nursing homes. In 2007, {{the mean number of}} patients being treated in hospice facilities on any <b>given</b> <b>day</b> was 90.2. 79.4% of hospice providers admitted fewer than 500 patients per year. The number of for-profit and non-profit providers has become more balanced as the for-profit sector has grown. In 2007, 47.1% of agencies were for-profit, with 48.6% non-profit. The remaining 4.3% were government-owned providers.|$|E
5|$|M-75 {{begins in}} {{downtown}} Boyne Falls at an intersection with US 131. It follows Mill Street northwesterly out of town, passing {{to the north}} of a lake and the Boyne Mountain Airport. The airport property ends at the intersection with C-48 west of Boyne Falls. M-75 runs parallel to the Boyne River until it turns west near the Boyne City Municipal Airport to enter the community of Boyne City on East Division Street. Two blocks further west, it meets C-73/East Jordan Road next to the Maple Lawn Cemetery. Next to the cemetery, the highway follows Boyne Avenue northwesterly into downtown. The trunkline turns north on East Street to cross the Boyne River and then turns east on State Street passing Rotary Park {{on the way out of}} town. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) measures the average annual daily traffic (AADT) in traffic surveys. AADT is a measure of the average traffic levels for a section of roadway on any <b>given</b> <b>day</b> of the year. The southern segment of M-75 carried 6,500vehicles daily in the 2007 survey. Of these vehicles, commercial traffic was measured at 280trucks.|$|E
