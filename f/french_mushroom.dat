They include Ophelia the praying mantis, Sam the caterpillar, Sonya the damselfly, Thistle the weevil, Miro the <b>French</b> <b>mushroom,</b> and Spider the spider, who the magazine is named after. The bugs are involved in their own story line throughout each issue, but they also comment on the articles or stories above them.

40|$|Mushrooms were {{soaked in}} water or salt {{solution}} covered with batter, French fried and then blast frozen. Average weight loss/gain {{for the process}} for water soaked mushrooms (6 hr soak) was nil. The frozen product had a high quality shelf life of at least 9 months. Samples French fried and frozen within 2 hr of picking had a better flavour and softer texture than those kept at 18 C and processed 24 hours later. <b>French</b> fried <b>mushrooms</b> that had been soaked in water or salt solution had a better flavour and texture than unsoaked ones. If the amount of batter used was increased an overall gain in mushroom weight for the process was obtained. However, product acceptability was adversely affected. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be soaked, coated with batter and then frozen. This results in a significant gain (up to 89 % of initial weight) to the processor since the weight loss encountered at the frying stage is now {{passed on to the}} consumer. The quality of this product was tested after 4 months and was satisfactory...|$|R
