40|$|Photodynamic Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (PACT) {{has emerged}} as a {{promising}} method for pathogen eradication and control. PACT uses light excitation of non-toxic photosensitisers to produce singlet oxygen (1 O 2), which in turn damages and eradicates microbial cells. In the present study, a naturally luminescent Vibrio campbellii strain ISO 7 (V. campbellii ISO 7) was used as a model aquaculture pathogen to test the suitability of two porphyrin compounds, the tetra-cationic TMPyP and the tetra-anionic TPPS 4, for the treatment of aquaculture water. Initial work accurately identified the bacterial strain and confirmed its virulence towards giant tiger prawns Penaeus monodon when injected. The strain killed 100 % of injected prawns within 1 to 16 h, while control prawns injected with sterile buffer remained healthy. Koch's postulates were satisfied by identification of re-isolated strains by multiplex PCR and sequencing of housekeeping genes. In separate time-course experiments, the two photosensitisers were diluted in aquaculture water seeded with the <b>indicator</b> <b>bacterium</b> and samples were irradiated for 24 h using 150 W white LED light. Luminescence assays, growth and regrowth experiments demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of generated 1 O 2 was both time- and dose-dependent, and confirmed that light or porphyrins alone were not toxic. Continuous irradiation in the presence of 20 μM cationic porphyrin for 5 h or 1 μM for 24 h achieved complete lethality of the <b>indicator</b> <b>bacterium.</b> Consistent with previous reports, the tested anionic porphyrin did not impact on the survival of the bacterium, causing only a slight decline in the luminescence signal. Photo-bleaching tests demonstrated natural degradation of both porphyrins after continuous irradiation, making them suitable as ‘self-destructive’ photosensitizers for in situ treatment of aquaculture waters, as they do not accumulate in the water...|$|E

Aiming the control of proliferation Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and SalmonellaTyphimurium, antimicrobial assays were performed with nisin as biocidal agent (concentrations 123 to 1, 111 AUmL- 1) and EDTA as chelating agent, compared to a Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923).

It was observed that EDTA is capable of reducing cell viability of P. aeruginosa. The bacteriocin nisin demonstrated effective antimicrobial action to four indicator bacteria, underdifferent concentrations. The combined treatments of nisin+EDTA obtained high inhibition rates, and the presenceof EDTA was significant only to Gram-negative bacteria.

40|$|Abstract: Studies {{have shown}} {{stormwater}} runoff is {{a contributor to}} elevated <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> concentrations in surface waters. These elevated concentrations may indicate a heightened human health risk and lead to water quality violations as concentrations exceed regulatory standards. Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) are commonly established for <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria,</b> requiring modeling and watershed planning to reduce loadings. However, factors correlated to <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> build-up and transport in urban watersheds have not been fully explored. Thus, efforts to manage <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> in urban watersheds are hampered. A watershed monitoring study in Raleigh, North Carolina, used flow weighted samples to provide detailed mass loadings of fecal coliform, E. coli, and enterococcus from a 5. 1 ha (12. 5 -acre) residential watershed.

40|$|Decay {{kinetics}} {{of bacteria}} in biological wastewater treatment systems {{are vital to}} efficient design and operation of treatment plants. Of special concern are decay characteristics of fecal indicator organisms, which can aid design of wastewater treatment processes to eliminate fecal pathogens. This study focuses on characterizing the decay of three strains of the key fecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacterium,</b> Escherichia coli, and comparing microbial techniques for quantifying decay rates. Traditional metrics for monitoring decay include volatile solids and plate counts, which may not provide the full picture of specific decay dynamics. In particular, the viable-but-not-culturable growth phase is challenging to assay. Recently, more specific molecular techniques have been developed, such as DNA and RNA extraction with qPCR and RT-qPCR, ATP assays and live/dead cell-staining. However, these assays have not been widely accepted or bench-marked against traditional techniques. It is expected that molecular assays will generate kinetic constants that better reflect the viability and activity of the bacteria as they decay, generating a more integrated understanding of the decay process.

40|$|The {{examination}} {{of water and}} other environmental sources for microbial pollution is a major public health undertaking. Currently, there are two accepted methods in use: the multiple-tube fermentation (MTF) and the membrane filtration (MF) tests. Both methods are designed to enumerate the secondary indicator group, total coliforms. Both tests suffer several inherent limitations, including a time delay of three to seven days to obtain a definitive result, the subjective nature of the test interpretation, and the inability to provide directly useful public health information. A defined substrate technology, originally used to enumerate specific bacterial species from mixtures in clinical urine specimens, was applied to water testing; the technology was constituted to enumerate simultaneously both total coliforms and the primary <b>indicator</b> <b>bacterium</b> E. coli. Examination of environmental isolates of these two classes of target microbes showed sensitivity equal to available methods, with potentially greater specificity. It was not subject to inhibition by bacteria other than the targets, grew injured coliforms, did not require confirmatory tests, and the maximum time to a positive was 24 hours.

This study was undertaken as a result of our previous findings that monitoring streams in Hawaii for traditional faecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> (faecal coliform, Escherichia coli, enterococci) was not useful in determining when streams are contaminated with sewage, because environmental (soil) sources rather than sewage accounted for the high concentrations of faecal bacteria in streams. Two perennial streams, sewage and soil samples were monitored for traditional faecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> (faecal coliform, E. coli, enterococci) and FRNA coliphages. The results showed that sewage treatment processes and disinfection drastically reduced the concentrations of traditional faecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> but FRNA coliphages were still present in significant concentrations in the treated sewage effluents. These results indicate that monitoring sewage effluents and environmental waters for only traditional faecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> may not be adequately protective of human health effects.

Gradients of increasing faecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> from the mouth to the upper, tidal freshwater reaches were observed, despite isolated peaks during either tidal phase. Phytoplankton biomass (measured as chlorophyll a) did not noticeably increase during the study. Variations in the abundances of all three faecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> and their correlations with physico-chemical parameters indicated that although the creek was likely subject to some level of faecal contamination, tidal movement serves to limit faecal indicator and phytoplankton levels in the creek through physico-chemical stress and dilution.

Biopiles were used to dispose of slaughterhouse-residuals and determine the occurrence and persistence patterns of <b>indicators</b> of pathogenic <b>bacteria.</b> The <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> included the family Enterobacteriaceae, total coliforms, Escherichia coli, nalidixic acid-resistant E. coli, and Streptococcus fecalis. The slaughterhouse-residual biopiles remained static for 164 d in 2006 and 141 d in 2007. In biopile effluent samples, exponentially decreasing populations of the <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> were observed. <b>Indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> presence in biopile and soil samples suggested their retention and persistence in, but not migration from, the media. Though the family Enterobacteriaceae, total coliforms, and Escherichia coli shared behavioral correlations, they exhibited different fates in all media compared to S. fecalis, which was observed to persist and re-grow. The behavior of inoculated nalidixic acid-resistant E. coli suggested that inactivation was the primary process in the biopiles.

Experimental results showed that Ag/SBA- 15 materials resulted in 7 center dot 5 log inactivation of E. coli for only 60 min, which exhibited very high antimicrobial activities at room temperature without using any light or electrical power input. The cell wall and cell membrane were destroyed in the antimicrobial process, leading to leakage of intracellular components. The formation of extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in the bactericidal process was confirmed. Production of intracellular ROS was also discovered.

Water temperature, current velocities and E. coli concentrations were computed using the 3 D hydrodynamic model Delft 3 DFlow. The model was calibrated with one storm event and verified with the other events. Simulation results reproduced the plume extension and theobserved E. coli concentrations.

The protocol allows for collecting a large number of samples quickly, relatively inexpensively, and under field conditions with limited access to capacity for sterilizing equipment. The protocol is tested on CAFO monitoring wells and considers three cross-contamination sources: equipment, wellbore, and ambient air. For the assessment, we use Enterococcus, a ubiquitous fecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacterium</b> (FIB), in laboratory and field tests with spiked and blank samples, and in an extensive, multi-year field sampling campaign on 17 wells within 2 CAFOs. The assessment shows that extended purging can successfully control for equipment cross-contamination, but also controls for significant contamination of the well-head, within the well casing and within the immediate aquifer vicinity of the well-screen. Importantly, our tests further indicate that Enterococcus is frequently entrained in water samples when exposed to ambient air at a CAFO during sample collection. Wellbore and air contamination pose separate challenges in the design of groundwater monitoring strategies on CAFOs that are not addressed by equipment sterilization, but require adequate QA/QC procedures and can be addressed by the proposed sampling strategy...|$|E

Confirmation procedures were also evaluated using 103 isolates and included LG and NM, ortho-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) with MUP (ONPG–MUP) and phosphatase reagent (PR). OPSP compared favourably with TSC agar. One false negative result was obtained {{from each of the}} LG/NM and ONPG–MUP procedures. No false results were obtained using the PR confirmation procedure. Conclusions: OPSP agar and PR were determined as suitable replacements for the AS/NZ Standard procedure with no interference from spreading organisms. Significance and Impact of the Study: This is a simple and rapid method for isolating and enumerating Cl. perfringens from sewage samples and confirmed results can be reported more quickly due to shorter analytical turnaround times...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> are {{considered}} an interesting target for microbiological analysis {{in order to}} obtain information about the hygiene of processes and products. Quantitative analysis targeting in- dicator bacteria offers several advantages over pathogenic <b>bacteria</b> since <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> prevalence and counts are higher, and their distribution is more homogeneous, than pathogens. However, although microbiological criteria addressing <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> are already in place in industrialised countries such as the EU and US, information on factors affecting their counts on carcasses at slaughter is scattered. Objectives: The aim of this review was to provide valuable information about the variability of <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> along the pig slaughterline, and to suggest suitable means for the implementation of GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) and process hygiene in pig slaughterhouses. Conclusions: Along the slaughterline, scalding and chilling stages effectively reduce both Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae counts on pig carcasses and have to be considered in the implementation of HACCP systems. Surface pasteurisation under experimental slaughter conditions was also effective; in contrast, washing did not reduce microbial contamination on pig carcasses. Evisceration was confirmed as a key contamination point, in particular regarding Enterobacteriaceae, but {{it has been suggested that}} bacterial load can be controlled by anal plugging if it is performed according to good manufacturing practices (GMP) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice between}} {{automatic}} and manual sampling of urban stormwater quality has been {{addressed in the}} past as an issue of economic efficiency, field safety, and practicality. Nevertheless, there is experimental evidence that both types of sampling may yield statistically different stormwater quality data. While the past attention focused on differences in sampled solids, a new issue was addressed in this study, the potential impacts of sampling methods on concentrations of <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Towards this end, four <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> (coliforms, E. coli, enterococci and C. perfringens) were sampled in storm sewers of two urban catchments in Östersund, Sweden, using both automatic samplers and manual sampling. Such data were further supplemented by measurements of total suspended solids (TSS) and turbidity, recognizing that bacteria are mostly transported in the attachment to solids. Preliminary results indicate that there may be large differences between <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> in automatic and manual samples, with E. coli measurements yielding the least differences, and turbidity readings were correlated well with all the <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> and particularly E. coli. These findings will be used in the continuation of this study for refining the existing experimental design and developing practical guidance for surveys of municipal storm sewers for faecal pollution.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 227 - 244). Traditional fecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> such as fecal coliform, E. coli and enterococci {{have been}} shown to be unreliable indicators of the hygienic quality of recreational waters under tropical conditions. One of the major reasons for considering these <b>bacteria</b> as ineffective <b>indicators</b> of water quality in warm, tropical regions is that they are consistently found in natural environments (plants, soil, water) in the absence of any significant contamination of these environments. Since preliminary studies conducted in Hawaii had indicated soil as the major environmental source of elevated concentrations of these bacteria in environmental waters, the aim of this study was to focus on the soil environment to specifically address two assumptions made by regulatory agencies in using fecal <b>bacteria</b> as <b>indicators</b> of water quality: first, there should not be an environmental source of these <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> unrelated to sewage or fecal matter contamination, and second, the <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> do not multiply in the environment. To determine the validity of these two assumptions under tropical conditions in Hawaii and possibly other tropical locations, various experiments were conducted. The major findings are as follows. 	 1) Analysis of soil samples collected from various locations representing major soil groups on the island of Oahu showed that fecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> are naturally found in most of the soil environments, indicating that the fecal bacteria have adapted to the soil conditions to become part of soil biota. 2) Evidence was obtained to show that the soil contains adequate nutrients to sustain the populations of these bacteria. 3) Growth and multiplication of fecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> in natural soil was dependent on available nutrients (particularly carbon), moisture and competing microorganisms. 	In conclusion, tropical soil conditions are suboptimal for the multiplication of fecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Consequently, these bacteria in natural soil conditions will probably grow and multiply sporadically when conditions are relatively optimal. Although concentrations of fecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> in soil represent only a small fraction of the microbiota, their counts are significant enough in numbers not only to impact the quality of recreational waters but also to nullify two of the assumptions used in the application of recreational water quality standards. Thus, there is a need for an alternate and more reliable indicator of water quality in Hawaii and other tropical locations.

40|$|Antibiotics {{have since}} the first {{discovery}} been the ultimate weapon against pathogenic bacteria. Even though antibiotic resistance is an old phenomenon the emergence of widespread resistance has become a big problem in modern medicine. One possible {{solution to this problem}} is a group of antimicrobial peptides, called bacteriocins. These peptides have different modes of action than traditional antibiotics, thus they can be used to kill antibiotic resistant pathogens. It is therefore believed that bacteriocins will be {{an important part of the}} pharmaceutical industry, and they are in fact already important in food preservation. The main aim of this study was to search for bacteria producing bacteriocins/antimicrobials capable of inhibiting Staphylococcus aureus and/or Pseudomonas aeruginosa in fermented fruit and vegetable samples. This was done using a dilution-based screening method where bacterial colonies showing inhibition of the <b>indicator</b> <b>bacterium</b> was chosen for characterization; spot-on-lawn inhibition assay, fingerprinting (rep-PCR and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)), sequencing and fermentation profiling. From screening a total of 44 isolates inhibiting S. aureus and 32 isolates inhibiting P. aeruginosa were obtained. All bacteria from the S. aureus screening showed to be producers of the bacteriocin nisin Z, with some differences in genetic- and fermentation profile between the producers. The bacteria found from screening against P. aeruginosa showed different inhibition on MRS and BHI agar, in addition to having a quorum sensing like pattern of inhibition. Further studies have to be done in order to characterize these isolates...|$|E
40|$|The Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) is a watershed-scale {{water quality}} model that {{includes}} detailed representation of agricultural management. The {{objective of this}} work {{was to develop a}} process-based model for simulating the fate and transport of manure-borne bacteria on land and in streams with the APEX model. The bacteria model utilizes manure erosion rates to estimate the amount of edge-of-field bacteria export. Bacteria survival in manure is simulated as a two-stage process separately for each manure application event. In-stream microbial fate and transport processes include bacteria release from streambeds due to sediment resuspension during high flow events, active release from the streambed sediment during low flow periods, bacteria settling with sediment, and survival. Default parameter values were selected from published databases and evaluated based on field observations. The APEX model with the newly developed microbial fate and transport module was applied to simulate fate and transport of the fecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacterium</b> Escherichia coli in the Toenepi watershed, New Zealand that was monitored for seven years. The stream network of the watershed ran through grazing lands with daily bovine waste deposition. Results show that the APEX with the bacteria module reproduced well the monitored pattern of E. coli concentrations at the watershed outlet. The APEX with the microbial fate and transport module will be utilized for predicting microbial quality of water as affected by various agricultural practices, evaluating monitoring protocols, and supporting the selection of management practices based on regulations that rely on fecal indicator bacteria concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Tylosin {{phosphate}} is a macrolide commonly {{administered to}} cattle in North America {{for the control}} of liver abscesses. This study investigated the effect of in-feed administration of tylosin phosphate to cattle at subtherapeutic levels and its subsequent withdrawal on macrolide resistance using enterococci as an <b>indicator</b> <b>bacterium.</b> Faecal samples were collected from steers that received no antibiotics and steers administered tylosin phosphate (11 ppm) in-feed for 197 d and withdrawn 28 d before slaughter. Enterococcus species isolated from faecal samples were identified through sequencing the groES-EL intergenic spacer region and subject to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, identification of resistance determinants and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiling. Tylosin increased (P 0. 05) between treatments on d 225. This suggests that antibiotic withdrawal prior to slaughter contributes {{to a reduction in}} the proportion of macrolide resistant enterococci entering the food chain. Among the 504 enterococci isolates characterised, E. hirae was found to predominate (n= 431), followed by E. villorum (n= 32), E. faecium (n= 21), E. durans (n= 7), E. casseliflavus (n= 4), E. mundtii (n= 4), E. gallinarum (n= 3), E. faecalis (n= 1), and E. thailandicus (n= 1). The diversity of enterococci was greater in steers at arrival than at exit from the feedlot. Erythromycin resistant isolates harboured the erm(B) and/or msrC gene. Similar PFGE profiles of eryR E. hirae n pre- and post-antibiotic treatment suggests the increased abundance of eryR enterococci after administration of tylosin phosphate reflects selection for strains that were within the bovine gastrointestinal tract of cattle at arrival...|$|E
40|$|The Aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} human viral contamination in urban rivers and its impact on coastal waters of southern California. During the first year study, three types of human viruses (adeno, entero and hepatitis A) were detected using nested- and RT-PCR at eleven rivers and creeks along southern California coast. Fecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> as well as somatic and F-specific coliphage were also tested. Approximately 50 % of the sites were positive for human adenoviruses. However, there was no clear relationship between detection of human viruses and the concentration of <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> and coliphage. Both fecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> and human viral input at beaches near river mouths were associated with storm events. The first storm of the wet season seemed to have the greatest impact on the coastal water quality than following storm events. During the second year of study, a detailed seasonal assessment of microbial pollution was conducted in two major Southern California urban rivers, San Gabriel and Los Angeles. A total of 114 river samples from five different sample locations along these two rivers were collected over a one-year period and analyzed for fecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria,</b> including total coliform, fecal coliform, and enterococcus and indicator viruses, including F-specific and somatic coliphage, and human entero and adenoviruses. Based on the California recreational water quality standards, 52. 5 % of the samples exceeded at least one fecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> standard. Both somatic and F-specific coliphage were detected in higher concentrations (up to 5 x 102 PFU/ 100 ml) during storm events. Enterovirus was detected in ~ 13 % of the samples by reverse-transcription PCR. Adenovirus was detected by real-time PCR in approximately 50 % of the samples, with concentrations ranging from 10 to > 106 genomes per liter. However, plaque assay using two human tissue culture cell lines, HEK- 293 A and A 549, yielded negative results suggesting adenoviruses detected by real-time PCR may not be infectious. Correlations between human adenoviruses and F-specific (p= 0. 13) and somatic coliphages (p= 0. 06) were found. However, these correlations were not statistically significant at 95 % level. No significant correlation between human adenoviruses and fecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> (total coliform, fecal coliform, and enterococcus) was observed. This study presents the first quantitative measure of human adenoviruses in urban rivers and their statistical relationship to fecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> and coliphages. This study also provides the first direct evidence that human viruses are prevalent in southern California urban rivers...|$|R
40|$|To provide {{evidence}} of septic system failure by comparing two faecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria,</b> enterococci and Escherichia coli, from defective septic tanks and adjacent creeks. A biochemical fingerprinting method was used to type and compare enterococci and E. coli strains from 39 septic tanks with creek water samples. Phenotypic diversity of enterococci (0 · 5 ± 0 · 3) and E. coli (0 · 5 ± 0 · 3) in septic tanks were significantly lower than those found in water samples. Among 1072 enterococci isolates tested from septic tanks, 203 biochemical phenotypes (BPTs) were found of which 98 BPTs from 33 septic tanks were identical to several water samples. Similarly, among 621 E. coli isolates tested from septic tanks, 159 BPTs were found of which 53 BPTs from 26 septic tanks were also identical to water samples. The number of the latter bacteria was significantly (P = 0 · 01) higher in water samples collected from downstream {{compared with that of}} upstream in the study area. A high similarity between the populations of both <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> was also found between defective septic tanks and downstream water samples further indicating the contamination of both creeks by defective septic systems. Biochemical fingerprinting of faecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> is a useful and rapid method to provide direct evidence for septic system failure. Combination of both faecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria</b> (enterococci and E. coli) provides a better judgement of the performance of a septic system. This study is the first to provide direct evidence of septic system failure by identifying the presence of specific bacterial types in septic tanks and surface waters. Based on our findings, we suggest that the performance evaluation of a septic system should be accompanied by direct analysis of faecal <b>indicator</b> <b>bacteria...</b>|$|R
