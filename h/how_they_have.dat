5|$|Lights and Sounds is {{the fifth}} studio album by American rock band Yellowcard, {{released}} on January 24, 2006, in the United States through Capitol Records. Lights and Sounds is Yellowcard's first concept album, which was inspired to reflect what the band was feeling {{at the time of}} production and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> matured in the process. Lights and Sounds also departs from the sounds on Yellowcard's previous album, Ocean Avenue (2003), which broke away from its pop punk sound to a more alternative rock album.|$|E
25|$|Flea {{appeared}} in the documentary The Other F Word, which aired on Showtime and was released through Oscilloscope Laboratories (a company founded by Adam Yauch). The documentary, which was directed by Andrea Blaugrund Nevins, focused on a generation of punk rockers, <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> handled fatherhood, and how they went from public rebel to domestic authority figure. Mark Hoppus, Jim Lindberg, Art Alexakis, and Mark Mothersbaugh were also featured.|$|E
25|$|What can {{be termed}} curses, shrap is also within the sativrata's power, {{understood}} to be a severe teaching to {{members of her family}} in <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> failed. One woman cursed her in-laws when they refused to bring neither a horse or a drummer to her pyre, saying that whenever in the future might have need of either (and many religious rituals requires such a presence), it would not be available to them.|$|E

25|$|Protestants can be {{differentiated}} {{according to}} <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{been influenced by}} important movements since the Reformation, today regarded as branches. Some of these movements have a common lineage, sometimes directly spawning individual denominations. Due to the earlier stated multitude of denominations, this section discusses only the largest denominational families, or branches, widely {{considered to be a}} part of Protestantism. These are, in alphabetical order: Adventist, Anglican, Baptist, Calvinist (Reformed), Lutheran, Methodist and Pentecostal. A small but historically significant Anabaptist branch is also discussed.|$|E
25|$|People {{with strong}} genetic risk for ovarian cancer may {{consider}} the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventative measure. This is often done {{after completion of}} childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in people at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed {{at the same time}} (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been studied.|$|E
25|$|As of 2001, {{the scholar}} of {{religion}} Olav Hammer could still note that books presenting the Theosophical doctrines were mostly apologetic in nature. Examples of such works include William Q. Judge's 1893 book Ocean of Theosophy and Robert Ellwood's 1986 book Theosophy. He noted {{that most of}} these works treated Theosophical doctrine {{as if it were a}} fixed entity and provided little or no discussion of <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> changed over the decades. Hammer also lamented that while scholarship on Theosophy was developing, it had not focused on the reformulation of Theosophy by Leadbeater and Besant or with the developing ideas of post-Theosophical writers like Steiner or Bailey.|$|E

25|$|The {{evolution}} {{of different types}} of sleep patterns is influenced by a number of selective pressures, including body size, relative metabolic rate, predation, type and location of food sources, and immune function. Sleep (especially deep SWS and REM) is tricky behavior because it steeply increases predation risk. This means that, for sleep to have evolved, the functions of sleep should have provided a substantial advantage over the risk it entails. In fact, studying sleep in different organisms shows <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> balanced this risk by evolving partial sleep mechanisms or by having protective habitats. Thus, studying the {{evolution of}} sleep might give a clue not only to the developmental aspects and mechanisms, but also to an adaptive justification for sleep.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Merkerson {{became the}} host of the show Find Our Missing which {{highlights}} the search for missing people of color. It is designed to put names and faces to people of color who have disappeared without a trace. Each episode {{tells the story of the}} missing person or persons, beginning with the day they vanished and the frantic searches by loved ones and investigators to find them. Find Our Missing provides insight into these victims’ lives–their hopes and dreams, what makes them tick, and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> touched those around them—from the people who know them best. The episodes chronicle the investigations into their disappearances, and why the search for them so far has only turned up dead ends.|$|E
25|$|Although {{only one}} out of every 100 bodies interred in the {{cemetery}} became naturally mummified, the concentration of this phenomenon has led to theories about <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> come about. Some believe that they are the result of people who had been buried alive, after mistakenly declared dead. These people, according to belief, died of desperation and asphyxiation and as a sign of their pain, convert into mummies. More commonly, it is likely the result of Guanjuato’s altitude or the abundance of minerals in the soil. However, all of the mummified remains were found in the cemetery’s above ground cement crypts, not in underground graves. Researchers believe the phenomenon is due to the warm, dry climate of the area, which dried out the bodies rapidly.|$|E

25|$|On {{his way in}} to shore, {{sharks are}} {{attracted}} to the marlin's blood. Santiago kills a great mako shark with his harpoon, but he loses the weapon. He makes a new harpoon by strapping his knife {{to the end of}} an oar to help ward off the next line of sharks; five sharks are slain and many others are driven away. But the sharks keep coming, and by nightfall the sharks have almost devoured the marlin's entire carcass, leaving a skeleton consisting mostly of its backbone, its tail and its head. Santiago knows that he is defeated and tells the sharks of <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> killed his dreams. Upon reaching the shore before dawn on the next day, Santiago struggles to his shack, carrying the heavy mast on his shoulder, leaving the fish head and the bones on the shore. Once home, he slumps onto his bed and falls into a deep sleep.|$|E
25|$|As {{discussed}} above, {{the floral}} organs of eudicotyledonous angiosperms {{are arranged in}} 4 different verticils, containing the sepals, petals, stamen and carpels. The ABC model states that the identity of these organs {{is determined by the}} homeotic genes A, A+B, B+C and C, respectively. In contrast with the sepal and petal verticils of the eudicots, the perigone of many plants of the Liliaceae family have two nearly identical external petaloid verticils (the tepals). In order to explain the floral morphology of the Liliaceae, van Tunen et al. proposed a modified ABC model in 1993. This model suggests that class B genes are not only expressed in verticils 2 and 3, but also in 1. It therefore follows that the organs of verticils 1 and 2 express class A and B genes and this is <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a petaloid structure. This theoretical model has been experimentally proven through the cloning and characterization of homologs of the Antirrhinum genes GLOBOSA and DEFICIENS in a Liliaceae, the tulip Tulipa gesneriana. These genes are expressed in verticils 1,2 and 3.|$|E
25|$|Geomicrobiology {{traditionally}} {{studies the}} interactions between microbes and minerals. While it is generally reliant on the tools of microbiology, microbial geochemistry uses geological and chemical methods to approach the same topic {{from the perspective of}} the rocks. Geomicrobiology and microbial geochemistry (GMG) is a relatively new interdisciplinary field that more broadly takes on the relationship between microbes, Earth, and environmental systems. Billed as a subset of both geobiology and geochemistry, GMG seeks to understand elemental biogeochemical cycles and the evolution of life on Earth. Specifically, it asks questions about where microbes live, their local and global abundance, their structural and functional biochemistry, <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> evolved, biomineralization, and their preservation potential and presence in the rock record. In many ways, GMG appears to be equivalent to geobiology, but differs in scope: geobiology focuses on the role of all life, while GMG is strictly microbial. Regardless, it is these tiniest creatures that dominated to history of life integrated over time and seem to have had the most far-reaching effects.|$|E
60|$|What {{had been}} said {{concerning}} Slugger Brown and Nappy Martell was true. Questioned by Colonel Colby, the two misguided cadets had finally broken down utterly and confessed everything, telling <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> once gotten into a quarrel with Captain Larkins on the lake and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> sought to get square by tampering with the fastenings of the lumber raft and the towline; and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> also related the particulars of <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> watched Jack and Fred go out shooting and had then purloined the two shotguns from the gun rack and hurried over to the Lacy farm to shoot the cows. Mr. Brown and Mr. Martell had been called upon to pay both the lake captain and the old farmer heavy damages; and thereupon <b>they</b> <b>had</b> withdrawn their sons from the Hall for the time being.|$|R
