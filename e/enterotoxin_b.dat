25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1960s, the {{chemical}} warfare capabilities of the United States began to decline due to, in part, a decline in public opinion concerning the corps. The corps continued to be plagued with bad press and mishaps. A 1969 incident, in which 23 soldiers and one Japanese civilian were exposed to sarin {{on the island of}} Okinawa while cleaning sarin-filled bombs, created international concern while revealing the presence of chemical munitions in Southeast Asia. The same year as this sarin mishap, President Richard Nixon reaffirmed a no first-use policy on chemical weapons as well as renouncing the use of biological agents. When the U.S. BW program ended in 1969, it had developed seven standardized biological weapons in the form of agents that cause anthrax, tularemia, brucellosis, Q-fever, VEE, and botulism. In addition, Staphylococcal <b>Enterotoxin</b> <b>B</b> was produced as an incapacitating agent.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} initial pH and of length of {{incubation}} time at 37 C in four different growth media {{on the production}} of staphylococcal <b>enterotoxins</b> A, <b>B,</b> and C was determined. A starting pH of 6. 8 gave higher yields of <b>enterotoxins</b> <b>B</b> and C than either pH 6. 0 or 5. 3. The production of enterotoxin A was, however, not materially affected by the low initial pH of 5. 3. Prolonged incubation (48 to 72 hr) resulted only occasionally in higher yields of enterotoxin. The effect of the media {{on the amount of}} enterotoxin produced is considerable. Difco Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) was inferior to either Fisher BHI, 4 % NZ Amine (NAK), or 3 % NAK plus 3 % protein hydrolysate powder at the three initial pH values, regardless of length of incubation time.

40|$|A fourth staphylococcal {{enterotoxin}} was identified serologically with antiserum {{to the very}} crude enterotoxic products of growth of a strain which also produces enterotoxin C, and then with antiserum to the considerably purified enterotoxic antigen of a strain which produces only the new enterotoxin. The identification of this antigen as enterotoxin D {{was based on the}} following observations. It was produced by strains which do not produce <b>enterotoxins</b> A, <b>B,</b> or C; it was absent in the growth products of nonenterotoxigenic strains; when appreciably purified, it was associated with emetic activity in the cat, and its biological activity was neutralized only by antisera containing its specific antibody and not by antibodies to <b>enterotoxins</b> A, <b>B,</b> and C. Staphylococcal strain 494 (ATCC 23235) was selected as the prototype strain. The production of this enterotoxin alone and together with enterotoxin A by strains of food-poisoning origin indicates that its role in food poisoning is second in frequency only to that of enterotoxin A.

5000|$|In {{the field}} of {{molecular}} biology, enterotoxin type B, also known as Staphylococcal <b>enterotoxin</b> <b>B</b> (SEB), is an enterotoxin produced by the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus.

Being quite stable, the toxin may remain active even after the contaminating bacteria are killed. It can withstand boiling at 100 °C for a few minutes. Gastroenteritis occurs because SEB is a superantigen, causing the immune system to release a large amount of cytokines that lead to significant inflammation.|$|E

40|$|We {{determined}} the nucleotide {{sequence of the}} gene encoding staphylococcal enterotoxin A (entA). The gene, composed of 771 base pairs, encodes an enterotoxin A precursor of 257 amino acid residues. A 24 -residue N-terminal hydrophobic leader sequence is apparently processed, yielding the mature form of staphylococcal enterotoxin A (Mr, 27, 100). Mature enterotoxin A has 82, 72, 74, and 34 amino acid residues in common with staphylococcal <b>enterotoxins</b> <b>B</b> and C 1, type A streptococcal exotoxin, and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, respectively. This level of homology {{was determined to be}} significant {{based on the results of}} computer analysis and biological considerations. DNA sequence homology between the entA gene and genes encoding other types of staphylococcal enterotoxins was examined by DNA-DNA hybridization analysis with probes derived from the entA gene. A 624 -base-pair DNA probe that represented an internal fragment of the entA gene hybridized well to DNA isolated from EntE+ strains and some EntA+ strains. In contrast, a 17 -base oligonucleotide probe that encoded a peptide conserved among staphylococcal <b>enterotoxins</b> A, <b>B,</b> and C 1 hybridized well to DNA isolated from EntA+, EntB+, EntC 1 +, and EntD+ strains. These hybridization results indicate that considerable sequence divergence has occurred within this family of exotoxins...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to disease caused by direct bacterial infection, some foodborne illnesses {{are caused by}} enterotoxins (exotoxins targeting the intestines). Enterotoxins can produce illness even when the microbes that produced them have been killed. Symptom appearance varies with the toxin but may be rapid in onset, {{as in the case}} of enterotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus in which symptoms appear in one to six hours. This causes intense vomiting including or not including diarrhea (resulting in staphylococcal enteritis), and staphylococcal enterotoxins (most commonly staphylococcal enterotoxin A but also including staphylococcal <b>enterotoxin</b> <b>B)</b> are the most commonly reported enterotoxins although cases of poisoning are likely underestimated. It occurs mainly in cooked and processed foods due to competition with other biota in raw foods, and humans are the main cause of contamination as a substantial percentage of humans are persistent carriers of S. aureus. The CDC has estimated about 240,000 cases per year in the United States.|$|E
40|$|Enterotoxin {{production}} by strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from routine samples of foods and from human beings was investigated. Twenty-one to 26 % of 112 strains isolated from raw meat, sausages and poultry and 32 - 36 % of 183 strains isolated from cooked foods, e. g. meat, chicken and frozen seafoods, produced <b>enterotoxins</b> A, <b>B,</b> C, D or E.

Maximum enterotoxin production with NAK medium was achieved by the addition of 5 mg of Mg 2 / per liter (for a total of 9 mg of Mg 2 + per liter) and 0. 5 mg of Fe 2 + per liter. Higher levels of magnesium were not inhibitory. Supplementing NAK with commonly used complex components, which added Mg 2 + above the 9 -mg/liter level, did not result in maximum yields of enterotoxin.

40|$|The thermal {{inactivation}} of staphylococcal <b>enterotoxin</b> <b>B</b> was {{studied in}} a phosphate-saline buffer, {{in the presence}} of two meat proteins, myosin and metmyoglobin (MetMb), and in a ground-beef slurry. When <b>enterotoxin</b> <b>B</b> was incubated at temperatures from 60 to 110 C, it was shown that the initial thermal inactivation at 80 C was faster than at 100 or 110 C. The heating of <b>enterotoxin</b> <b>B</b> at 60, 80, and 100 C {{in the presence of}} either myosin or MetMb resulted in a rapid loss of the enterotoxin. Thermal loss of the <b>enterotoxin</b> <b>B</b> molecule in the presence of meat proteins was more pronounced at 80 C than at either 60 or 100 C. Thermal loss of <b>enterotoxin</b> <b>B</b> molecule in the presence of meat proteins was more pronounced at 80 C than at either 60 or 100 C. Thermal loss of <b>enterotoxin</b> <b>B</b> in a ground round slurry was rapid when compared to inactivation in a phosphate-saline buffer.

40|$|The {{inactivation}} of <b>enterotoxin</b> <b>B</b> by γ irradiation was {{studied by}} use of single-and double-gel-diffusion assay techniques. <b>Enterotoxin</b> <b>B</b> (99 +% purity) was suspended either in 0. 04 m Veronal buffer (pH 7. 2) or in milk, dispensed and heat-sealed in borosilicate glass vials, and irradiated essentially at 21 to 26 C with a cobalt- 60 source. Parallel titrations of irradiated <b>enterotoxin</b> <b>B</b> in Veronal buffer were made {{by use of}} gel-diffusion and cat assay procedures to establish the relative sensitivity of these two assay procedures to irradiated enterotoxin. Results were identical. A dose of 5 Mrad was required to reduce an <b>enterotoxin</b> <b>B</b> concentration of 31 μg/ml in Veronal buffer to less than 0. 7 μg/ml. When milk {{was used as a}} vehicle, a dose of 20 Mrad was needed to inactivate a 30 μg/ml concentration of <b>enterotoxin</b> <b>B</b> to less than 0. 5 μg/ml.

If the toxin was stirred during heating, reactivation did not occur. An examination of the reactivation kinetics of heat-treated SEC showed that reactivation was temperature dependent. At 25 C, the incubation temperature of heat-treated crude SEC (80 C for 10 min), 100 % reactivation occurred after 24 h, whereas at 4 C only slight reactivation was observed. We and others observed that heat-treated toxins initially lost more serological activity when heated at a low temperature (80 C) than at a higher temperature (100 C); {{in the present study}} we demonstrate that this is a reversible phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a reliable assay {{to measure the}} specific binding of 125 I-labeled staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) by murine spleen cells. Toxin binding by lymphocytes was specific {{in that it was}} inhibited by unlabeled SEA but not by unrelated proteins. The biological activity of SEA (T-lymphocyte mitogenesis) correlated with toxin binding to splenic lymphocytes. In the presence of high concentrations of [125 I]SEA, specific binding increased rapidly and approached saturation after 2 h. Toxin binding was sensitive to temperature and pH and was directly proportional to the concentration of spleen cells in the incubation mixture. We estimated that there was a single class of toxin-binding sites, which had an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 8 x 10 (- 7) M and numbered 3, 600 sites per cell. SEA and the antigenically distinct compounds staphylococcal <b>enterotoxins</b> <b>B</b> and E in excess competitively inhibited binding of [125 I]SEA to mouse spleen cells.
