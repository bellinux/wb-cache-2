25|$|The {{success of}} the {{province}}'s public health care program {{was not lost on}} the federal government. Another Saskatchewan politician, newly elected Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, decreed in 1958 that any province seeking to introduce a <b>hospital</b> <b>plan</b> would receive 50 cents on the dollar from the federal government. In 1962, Diefenbaker appointed Justice Emmett Hall—also of Saskatchewan, a noted jurist and Supreme Court Justice—to Chair a Royal Commission on the national health system—the Royal Commission on Health Services. In 1964, Justice Hall recommended a nationwide adoption of Saskatchewan's model of public health insurance. In 1966, the Liberal minority government of Lester B. Pearson created such a program, with the federal government paying 50% of the costs and the provinces the other half. So, the adoption of health care across Canada ended up being the work of three men with diverse political ideals - Tommy Douglas, John Diefenbaker and Lester Pearson.|$|E

50|$|The present Wythenshawe Hospital {{developed}} {{on the site}} of the former Baguley Sanatorium which opened on October 4, 1902. It became a 150-bed sanatorium for the sole treatment of TB patients in 1912. The idea of Wythenshawe Hospital was initially discussed in 1939. An Emergency Medical Services hospital - consisting of rows of wooden huts - was constructed and used to treat soldiers who had been injured or burned. This was the foundation of the hospital's specialisation in burns and plastic surgery. The hospital was substantially developed in the 1960s as part of Enoch Powell's 1962 <b>Hospital</b> <b>Plan</b> and further after the closure of Withington Hospital.|$|E
50|$|Some idea of {{hospital}} architecture {{can be inferred}} from the monastic hospitals at Mihintale and Polonnaruwa. This <b>hospital</b> <b>plan</b> {{can be seen at}} the National Museum, Colombo. There was an inner and outer court and the rectangular inner court had a series of cells, toilets and bath, with an exit at one end. One cell had a medicinal bath. Alahena had long dormitories instead of cells. The outer court accommodated a refectory, a hot water bath, storerooms and dispensary. A wall cordoned off the hospitals. The provision of two open courts in addition to windows ensured maximum ventilation and free circulation of air within the building itself.|$|E
40|$|This article {{tests the}} thesis of supply-induced demand in the German {{hospital}} sector. The empirical investigation described makes use of comprehensive data and represents {{the first time this}} has been done for Germany. A cross-section analysis is performed at the level of geographical planning regions. At this level the hospital date encompass the whole population and distinguish ten different medical specialities. 13 different economic and social variables are analysed in a system of simultaneous equations. The result shows that the supply of treatment capacity has a positive influence on the demand for hospital treatments, the number of patients treated per 100, 000 population rising with bed density. Alternative explanations for this phenomenon are also checked, without result. No correlation can be found between morbidity and the number of hospital cases in any given region. Although hospital bed density is found to depend on the number of hospital cases per head of population, this is no proof of the reverse causality, as this result {{can be traced back to}} the strategy behind the existing <b>hospital</b> <b>planning.</b> The validity of Roemer's Law in Germany is likely to be (at least partially) due to this existing <b>hospital</b> <b>planning.</b> This is because the prevailing <b>hospital</b> <b>planning</b> procedure is distorted, inidcating a higher need for hospital beds where bed density is already high. Given this situation, and the results of the regression analysis, it would seem appropriate to consider abolishing the <b>hospital</b> <b>planning</b> system and radically reducing the density of hospital beds.

The RM of Pittville at Hazlet already had a health scheme, devised by William J. Burak, whereby its residents received both medical and hospital care for just under $11 per person per year. Wishing to add the Pittville method of full medical care to the preventive program planned for the southwest, Burak wrote at his own expense to each municipality, town and village, visited each weekly newspaper editor, and called a public meeting to press for a full medical and <b>hospital</b> <b>plan.</b> When a vote of all ratepayers was held on November 26, 1945, a majority voted in favour of a full regional health plan.|$|E

To help offset the reduction of rates caused by the Depression, In 1932, Armstrong and the entire hospital staff donated {{five percent of the}} salaries to the hospital. In 1942 he introduced a ten-year plan to expand the hospital. The expansion included the construction of the Victory Wing, which included the first cancer clinic in Ontario, a dietary wing, the Walter T. Connell Wing, and a children’s hospital. Armstrong retired from KGH in 1957, but stayed on as a consultant until the construction projects were completed.|$|E

5000|$|At Toowoomba, {{five new}} {{buildings}} were erected {{as a result}} of Ellerton's initiatives. Ellerton was a strong advocate of the [...] "moral treatment" [...] approach to insanity. This approach stressed the need for providing a pleasant environment for patients and useful employment and recreation. This philosophy was evident in a pair of new large blocks erected in 1917-1919 Female Ward 5 (Whishaw House) and Male Ward E (Browne House) set within landscaped grounds with views to the surrounding countryside. Also in this period, a pair of domestic scale wards (Male Admission Ward - James House and Female Admission Ward - Hill House) and a hospital ward (Tredgold House) were completed. These buildings faced a recreation ground centred on the east-west axis of the original <b>hospital</b> <b>plan.</b> Throughout this period agriculture was important part of the asylum operations, partly to offset costs and also to provide employment for patients.|$|E
5000|$|No more {{top-down}} reorganisation was proposed, {{but instead}} {{the development of}} new models to suit local needs, something quite radical for the NHS, which is accustomed to the imposition of uniformity regardless of local conditions. It seeks to break away from Enoch Powell’s 1962 <b>Hospital</b> <b>Plan</b> for England and Wales which established the district general hospital as the central pillar of British healthcare. [...] Even more radical is the proposal to erode the distinction between hospital consultants and General practitioners, encouraging hospitals to employ GPs - a distinction which has lasted in the UK {{for more than a century}} - and permit the development of [...] "Accountable Care Organisations" [...] similar to those in Spain and parts of the USA. There is much stress on the fact that 70% of the NHS budget is spent on the management of the 15 million people with long term conditions. Two new models of care - multispecialty community providers, and primary and acute care systems - involve integrating primary care and hospital care in a single provider organisation.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{difficult}} economic context, the government maintained significant public investments. The European enlargement led the Luxembourgish State to invest {{heavily in the}} improvement and extension of the EU's infrastructure and services, based in Luxembourg. The government was also concerned with consolidating {{the country as a}} European seat. In June 2001 building work commenced on the Place de l’Europe in Luxembourg-Kirchberg. The project included two office towers, an extension of the conference centre as well as a concert hall. The conversion of industrial wastelands of ARBED in Belval constituted the second large construction project started under this government. This development project which aimed to improve the Southern region, manifested the government's decentralisation policy. In February 2001, the company Agora, including representatives of the State, ARBED, and the communes of Esch-sur-Alzette and Sanem, was created to develop the wastelands. The Fonds Belval, a state-owned company, was charged with realising the State's plans on the Belval-Ouest site and to showcase the blast furnaces. The industrial wastelands would host the [...] "Centre de musiques amplifiées" [...] (Rockhal) and a [...] "Cité des sciences, de la recherche et de l’innovation".
