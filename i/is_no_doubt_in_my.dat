However, Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. [...] "I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided [...] "what limits he puts on his own rights". To this Shackleton replied: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further".|$|E
500|$|Contemporaries of Edwards {{have been}} unstinting in their praise of his abilities. Bobby Charlton {{described}} him as [...] "the only player {{that made me feel}} inferior" [...] and said his death was [...] "the biggest single tragedy ever to happen to Manchester United and English football". Terry Venables claimed that, had he lived, it would have been Edwards, not Bobby Moore, who lifted the World Cup trophy as England captain in 1966. Tommy Docherty stated that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that Duncan would have become the greatest player ever. Not just in British football, with United and England, but the best in the world. George Best was something special, as was Pelé and Maradona, but in my mind Duncan was much better in terms of all-round ability and skill." [...] In recognition of his talents Edwards was made an inaugural inductee to the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002. [...] His memorabilia was exhibited at Dudley Museum prior to its closure, and was subsequently sold to Manchester United with a selection to be loaned back for display at the Dudley Archives.|$|E

It is being released in the UK via Spinefarm Records. The album was produced by Chris [...] "Zeuss" [...] Harris. Drummer Jason Bittner recently stated about the band's new material, [...] "The songs {{are a little more}} on the darker, angry side... lots of heaviness, lots of crazy guitar, and LOTS of room for me to have some fun. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that this will be the best performance of my career, so far, and I owe that to my guys for bringing me incredible riffs to write killer drum parts to." [...] As of the fall of 2009 the band was appearing on the 'Shock & Raw' tour of North America with 2Cents, Otep & Five Finger Death Punch. After a South American tour, Shadows Fall will be playing on the Jägermeister Stage in the 2010 Rockstar Mayhem Festival in July and August 2010. The band is also scheduled to support Lamb of God on their Australian tour in December 2009 Shadows Fall is pleased to announce their first and only New York City performance this year, taking place at Santos Party House on December 18, 2010 with direct support from Thy Will Be Done.|$|E

Martin added on his earlier comments: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that her devotion to Canada is longstanding and resolute," [...] though some critics continued to argue that Jean's response had been too vague. By late August, polls showed that there had been a 20% drop in support for the recommendation of Jean as the next governor general, in response to which the Haitian community voiced their support for Jean, even holding special church services in her honour. Jean reaffirmed in late 2010 that the rumours of her separatist sympathies were untrue and revealed that she had been upset by those journalists who she saw as capitalizing on sensationalism, rather than seeking accuracy through investigation, but she had been advised repeatedly not to respond.|$|E

2500|$|On 24 February 1964, Morris Berthold Abram, the {{president}} of the American Jewish Committee and supported by a United States representative to the United Nation's Commission on Human Rights, brought Kitchko's work to worldwide attention by attacking the book during a press conference. Shortly afterwards, international criticism was leveled at Kitchko and his book. Communist parties worldwide condemned the work. The French communist newspaper, L'Humanité denounced the book and demanded the Soviet Union disavow the work. Gus Hall, the secretary-general of the United States Communist Party, stated [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind about the anti-Semitic character of what I have seen. Such stereotyped, slanderous caricatures of the Jewish people must be unequivocally condemned." [...] To exploit this discontent with the Soviet Union, the American Central Intelligence Agency had the book translated into French to be distributed to left-wing groups across Europe. When Khrushchev toured Scandinavia, in the spring of 1964, demonstrations took place against the USSR's treatment of Jews, in part motivated by the publication of Judaism Without Embellishment. In the Ukraine, reaction to the book was also negative. Ukrainian nationalist Mykola Lebed saw the book [...] "as a Soviet attempt to paint Ukrainians with a broad anti-Semitic brush". The result was Ukrainians, especially amongst the former supports of Stepan Bandera, switching from using anti-Semitism as a weapon to use against the Soviet authorities to attacking the Soviet Government for being anti-Semitic.|$|E

60|$|Brandeis, expecting attack, {{sought to}} improve his indefensible position. He {{reformed}} his centre by the simple expedient of suppressing it. Apia was evacuated. The two flanks, Mulinuu and Matautu, were still held and fortified, Mulinuu (as I have said) to the isthmus, Matautu on {{a line from the}} bayside to the little river Fuisa. The centre was represented by the trajectory of a boat across the bay from one flank to another, and was held (we may say) by the German war-ship. Mataafa decided (I am assured) to make a feint on Matautu, induce Brandeis to deplete Mulinuu in support, and then fall upon and carry that. And there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that such a plan was bruited abroad, for nothing but a belief in it could explain the behaviour of Brandeis on the 12th. That it was seriously entertained by Mataafa I stoutly disbelieve; the German flag and sailors forbidding the enterprise in Mulinuu. So that we may call this false intelligence {{the beginning and the end}} of Mataafa's strategy.|$|E

If I had informed the government of what I had found, this gold would have gone directly into the hands of the descendants of the people from whom its original owners did their very best to keep it, and nobody else would have had a dollar's worth of it. If we had stood up for our rights to a reward for finding it, ten to one we would all have been clapped into prison." ...|$|E
60|$|His first impulse, {{under these}} circumstances, was doubtless {{to try to}} {{extinguish}} the flames, and failing in that, his second impulse (ignorant as he was {{of the state of}} the lock) had been to attempt to escape by the door which had given him entrance. When I had called to him, the flames must have reached across the door leading into the church, on either side of which the presses extended, and close to which the other combustible objects were placed. In all probability, the smoke and flame (confined as they were to the room) had been too much for him when he tried to escape by the inner door. He must have dropped in his death-swoon--he must have sunk in the place where he was found--just as I got on the roof to break the skylight window. Even if we had been able, afterwards, to get into the church, and to burst open the door from that side, the delay must have been fatal. He would have been past saving, long past saving, by that time. We should only have given the flames free ingress into the church--the church, which was now preserved, but which, in that event, would have shared the fate of the vestry. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind, there can be no doubt in the mind of any one, that he was a dead man before ever we got to the empty cottage, and worked with might and main to tear down the beam.|$|E

"Yes, gentlemen," [...] said he, [...] "it is {{the most}} famous pearl now {{existing}} in the world, {{and it has been}} my good fortune, by a connected chain of inductive reasoning, to trace it from the Prince of Colonna's bedroom at the Dacre Hotel, where it was lost, to the interior of this, the last of the six busts of Napoleon which were manufactured by Gelder & Co., of Stepney. You will remember, Lestrade, the sensation caused by the disappearance of this valuable jewel and the vain efforts of the London police to recover it. I was myself consulted upon the case, but I was unable to throw any light upon it. Suspicion fell upon the maid of the Princess, who was an Italian, and it was proved that she had a brother in London, but we failed to trace any connection between them. The maid's name was Lucretia Venucci, and there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that this Pietro who was murdered two nights ago was the brother. I have been looking up the dates in the old files of the paper, and I find that the disappearance of the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest of Beppo, for some crime of violence--an event which took place in the factory of Gelder & Co., at the very moment when these busts were being made. Now you clearly see the sequence of events, though you see them, of course, in the inverse order {{to the way in which}} they presented themselves to me. Beppo had the pearl in his possession. He may have stolen it from Pietro, he may have been Pietro's confederate, he may have been the go-between of Pietro and his sister. It is of no consequence to us which is the correct solution.|$|E
