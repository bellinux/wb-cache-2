5|$|Brian and Stewie go to {{the mall}} so they can meet Santa, but Peter is asking Santa for gifts (he asks for a game of Uno, a Magna Doodle, a pet chink (a mix of a {{chinchilla}} and a mink) and a Charles in Charge lunchbox.) When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in his lap, Santa mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving before he <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> sit in his lap felt like a bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; this takes us to Busey looking himself in the mirror asking his reflection, {{in the form of a}} crazed clown, how he is doing.|$|E
5|$|The final ten contestants then {{competed in}} the live studio finals held on Saturday nights over six weeks.

25|$|The {{reason why}} Odo was {{defeated}} so easily at Bordeaux and Garonne, but had won 11 years earlier at the Battle of Toulouse is simple. At Toulouse, Odo managed a surprise attack against an overconfident and unprepared foe. The Umayyad forces were mostly infantry, and what cavalry {{they did have}} never <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> mobilize. As Herman of Carinthia wrote {{in one of his}} translations of a history of al-Andalus, Odo managed a highly successful encircling envelopment which took the attackers totally by surprise – the result was a chaotic slaughter of the Muslim forces.|$|E

50|$|Townsville {{missed the}} playoffs in 2002 and the 2003 season looked no better, but the Crocodiles strung {{together}} a 16-game winning streak to again finish second on the NBL ladder.

25|$|In the {{championship}} round each board was worth money, beginning at $200 and increasing by $100 {{for each additional}} board until someone won the game. Each board had a specific category for it and six words fitting that category on it. Henry read a clue {{for one of the}} words, and the first contestant to buzz in and correctly locate it was given twenty seconds to find the other five words. Doing so won the value of the board, but if the contestant could not do this the opposing contestant <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> steal by finding just one of the remaining words within five seconds. Doing so won the opponent the money attached to the board; otherwise, the money stayed with the first contestant.|$|E
