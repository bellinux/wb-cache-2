5|$|One {{improvement}} to {{the original}} F-84 design was rocket racks that folded <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wing after the 5-inch HVAR rockets were fired, which reduced drag over the older fixed mounting racks. This innovation was adopted by other U.S. jet fighter-bombers.|$|E
5|$|After an implant is placed, the {{internal}} components {{are covered with}} either a healing abutment, or a cover screw. A healing abutment passes through the mucosa, and the surrounding mucosa is adapted around it. A cover screw is <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> surface of the dental implant, and {{is designed to be}} completely covered by mucosa. After an integration period, a second surgery is required to reflect the mucosa and place a healing abutment.|$|E
5|$|Great kivas {{are always}} much larger and deeper than Chaco-style kivas. Whereas {{the walls of}} great kivas always extend above the {{surrounding}} landscape, the walls of Chaco-style kivas are <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> surrounding landscape. Chaco-style kivas are often found incorporated into the central room blocks of great houses, but great kivas are always separate from core structures. Great kivas almost always have a bench that encircles the inner space, but this feature is not found in Chaco-style kivas. Great kivas also tend to include floor vaults, which may have served as foot drums for ceremonial dancers, but Chaco-style kivas do not.|$|E

Mrs. Cristie gave him few {{opportunities}} of making her know him as he wished her to know him. He had sense enough to see that this was intentional, and that if he made any efforts to improve his opportunities he might drive her away.|$|R
5|$|In malignant-type {{smallpox}} (also called flat smallpox) the lesions remained almost <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> skin at {{the time}} when raised vesicles form in the ordinary type. It is unknown why some people developed this type. Historically, it accounted for 5–10 percent of cases, and the majority (72 percent) were children. Malignant smallpox was accompanied by a severe prodromal phase that lasted 3–4 days, prolonged high fever, and severe symptoms of toxemia. The rash on the tongue and palate was extensive. Skin lesions matured slowly and by the seventh or eighth day they were flat and appeared to be buried in the skin. Unlike ordinary-type smallpox, the vesicles contained little fluid, were soft and velvety to the touch, and may have contained hemorrhages. Malignant smallpox was nearly always fatal.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Ellwood's 1898-1899 renovations were superficial, {{especially}} {{when compared to}} the alterations his son made to the original design a decade later. He had the bracketed cornice replaced with a Classical cornice with dentils and a projecting molding. The window lintels were altered in a style similar to the new cornice. On the tower, the two windows on the first floor were replaced with one larger window while the projecting bay over the east portico was removed and made <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rest of the house. The windows over that portico were replaced with a heavy double door that opened onto the roof over the veranda, which had been built over the entire front of the house. It was during this time that the first porte-cochere was built {{on the south side of}} the home.|$|E
5|$|The P90 uses {{a unique}} {{horizontally}} mounted feeding system—patented in the United States—that {{contributes to the}} weapon's compact profile and unusual appearance. U.S. Patent 4,905,394 ("Top mounted longitudinal magazine") was awarded in 1990, naming René Predazzer as the sole inventor. The detachable box magazine is mounted parallel to the P90's barrel, fitting <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> top of the weapon's frame, and it contains 50 rounds of ammunition which lie in two rows facing left, offset 90° from the bore axis. As the cartridges are pushed back by spring pressure and arrive at the rear end of the magazine, they are fed as a single row into a spiral feed ramp and rotated 90 degrees, aligning them with the chamber. The magazine body is composed of polymer, and it is semi-transparent to allow the shooter to see the amount of ammunition remaining at any time.|$|E

5|$|The tower's gun {{installations}} {{were intended}} {{to be used to}} deal with an external threat approaching from {{the far side of the}} river. The parapet of the roof was crenellated with nine wide embrasures, and the embrasures facing out across the river were constructed <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> floor of the roof, giving the bombards plenty of room to fire. The embrasures facing away from the river, however, had sloping cills rather than open positions, and the windows in the tower facing towards the city were rectangular and relatively unprotected. The entrance to the tower itself was not fortified, as the tower was not expected to be defended from a direct attack by land.|$|E
5|$|The Blackstone is a 22-floor {{rectangular}} {{structure and}} its structural steel frame is cased in tile and plaster fireproofing. On the exterior {{south and east}} (front) elevations is a one-story base of pink granite, with high arched openings; it supports the red brick- and terra cotta-trimmed building shaft. Above the granite base are four stories of white, glazed terra cotta. The large windows of {{the second and third}} floor, which once poured natural light into the lobby, ballroom, and restaurants, have mostly been covered for a theater. The majority of the building rises as a 12-story shaft of red brick dotted with white, terra cotta window surrounds; above this section is a belt course of terra cotta and two stories of red brick. Above this, the original design included an intermediate terra cotta cornice topped by a cast-iron railing. This has been removed and replaced with red brick and white glazed brick, <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rest of the building. The mansard roof was originally decorated with small spires around the perimeter, and 2 very tall flagpoles.|$|E
5|$|The arch gateway at {{the western}} end of the churchyard bears a skull and {{crossbones}} at the top of each pillar. The memorials in the churchyard are mainly dated 1750–1850, and most are lined against the churchyard's south wall or are <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ground. Some show fine carving, commensurate with commercial success. They include the memorials of French-born wine merchant Jean Gaudin and the Litherland brothers, founders of Royal Crown Derby. From 1804, French prisoners of war were quartered in Ashby, and those who died before their release, or who stayed and married local women, are also buried in the churchyard. A group of memorials are for members of a prosperous local family, the Mammatts. Edward Mammatt, church organist for 40 years and a successful scientist despite being blinded at age six, also has a monument in the church, and one of the Victorian windows is dedicated to his widow by their sons.|$|E

5|$|After {{commissioning}} {{too late}} {{to participate in the}} First World War, Argus was tasked to conduct deck-landing trials with longitudinal arresting gear transferred from Furious. The first landing on the ship was made on 1 October 1918 by a Sopwith Ship Strutter. The same month, the ship was used in trials to evaluate the effects which an island superstructure would have on flying operations, with a canvas-and-wood dummy island being installed with a smoke box to simulate funnel gases. By 19 December, 36 successful landings had been made by Ship Strutters and Sopwith Pups. Argus was refitted from 23 December to 21 March 1919 with modified arresting gear. The wires of the arresting gear had been lifted off the deck so they could engage the hooks on the undercarriages of the aircraft, but this prevented the use of the flight deck for any other purpose. The after lift was therefore lowered , which allowed aircraft to use the area when the lift was raised <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rest of the flight deck. Trials began in April and the lift was widened in October. Argus joined the Atlantic Fleet in January 1920 for its Spring Cruise carrying eight Ship Strutters, four Sopwith Camel fighters, two Airco DH.9A bombers and two Fairey floatplanes. Operational experience confirmed that the aircraft should attempt to land directly onto the arresting gear lest they be blown {{over the side of the}} carrier, as happened three times during the cruise.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{instead of}} a grille, the Taurus had a front panel to adopt a grille-less 'bottom breather' nose, first pioneered by the Citroën DS in the 1950s. The Taurus' doors flowed up into the roof, and were {{designed}} to make the interior airtight, as well as having the door handles and windows <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rest of the car. The bumpers on the Taurus were designed to also be incorporated {{with the rest of}} the car's design, being <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rest of the body. The wheels were also pushed out to the ends of the frame, and were <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fender, instead of being recessed into the fender. This not only improved the car's aerodynamics, it improved handling as well.|$|E
