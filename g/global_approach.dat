2500|$|Tzigara's {{contribution}} as an {{art historian}} has received mixed evaluations. According to Lucian Nastasă, his 1911 course at the Bucharest University was the first professional approach to the subject, after the [...] "somewhat organized" [...] attempts on Odobescu's part. Writing in 1920, art historian Gheorghe Oprescu also suggested that, with Nicolae Iorga's reviews, Tzigara's [...] "intelligent articles" [...] {{were the only ones}} in the Romanian press to properly educate the public taste. Charles Upson Clark also rated [...] "Tzigara-Samurcash" [...] as one of Romania's [...] "best-known modern writers" [...] in the field of archeology or ancient art, with Alexandru Lapedatu, George Murnu and Abgar Baltazar. Contrarily, a later assessment made by ethnologist Romulus Vulcănescu rated both Tzigara, Iorga and Oprescu as authors of [...] "ethnological essayistics and cultural microhistory", who lacked a <b>global</b> <b>approach</b> to folk art research. Dumitru Hîncu, writing in 2007, noted that, once [...] "a first-rate cultural figure", Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș [...] "no longer says a great deal for your average present-day reader".|$|E
2500|$|While Dhammananda has a {{somewhat}} <b>global</b> <b>approach</b> {{as evidenced by}} founding an international newsletter or hosting an international conference, she has repeatedly stated that most problems in Thailand must be solved by the Thai people without the [...] "help" [...] of outsiders, including Western Buddhists. The solutions she offers are generally down-to-earth, concrete, and practical with an occasional hint of idealism shared by other Buddhist modernists. She makes clear acknowledgments about both the weaknesses and strengths of the current Thai Sangha; her writing advocates serious reform for monastic and lay Buddhists, {{not the least of}} which is the reestablishment of the Bhikkhuni order. Nantawan Boonprasat-Lewis comments [...] "Kabilsingh thus advocates for the Sangha to be more involved in providing spiritual guidance to the laity and deal with their own fear of having women be equal to men. The social crisis, she says, is greater than this fear and needs the cooperation and involvement of all, regardless of gender, class, and ethnicity." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. There {{have been}} two major {{approaches}} for classification of networked (linked) data. Local approaches (iterative classification) learn a model locally without considering unlabeled data and apply the model iteratively to classify unlabeled data. <b>Global</b> <b>approaches</b> (collective classification), on the other hand, exploit unlabeled data and the links occurring between labeled and unlabeled data for learning. Naturally, <b>global</b> <b>approaches</b> are computationally more demanding than local ones. Moreover, for large data sets, approximate inference has to be performed to make computations feasible. In the present work, we investigate the benefits of collective classification based on global probabilistic models over local approaches. Our experimental results show that <b>global</b> <b>approaches</b> do not always outperform local approaches {{with respect to the}} classification accuracy. More precisely, the results suggest that <b>global</b> <b>approaches</b> considerably outperform local approaches only for low ratios of labeled data. ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, the mining {{industry}} and Industrial Revolution stimulated the rapid {{development of the}} stratigraphic column - “the sequence of rock formations arranged according to their order of formation in time.” In England, the mining surveyor William Smith, starting in the 1790s, found empirically that fossils were a highly effective means of distinguishing between otherwise similar formations of the landscape as he travelled the country working on the canal system and produced the first geological map of Britain. [...] At about the same time, the French comparative anatomist Georges Cuvier assisted by his colleague Alexandre Brogniart at the École des Mines de Paris realized that the relative ages of fossils could be determined from a geological standpoint; {{in terms of what}} layer of rock the fossils are located and the distance these layers of rock are {{from the surface of the}} Earth. Through the synthesis of their findings, Brogniart and Cuvier realized that different strata could be identified by fossil contents and thus each stratum could be assigned to a unique position in a sequence. [...] After the publication of Cuvier and Brongniart’s book, “Description Geologiques des Environs de Paris” in 1811, which outlined the concept, stratigraphy became very popular amongst geologists; many hoped to apply this concept to all the rocks of the Earth. During this century various geologists further refined and completed the stratigraphic column. [...] For instance, in 1833 while Adam Sedgwick was mapping rocks that he had established were from the Cambrian Period, Charles Lyell was elsewhere suggesting a subdivision of the Tertiary Period; whilst Roderick Murchison, mapping into Wales from a different direction, was assigning the upper parts of Sedgwick's Cambrian to the lower parts of his own Silurian Period. The stratigraphic column was significant because it supplied a method to assign a relative age of these rocks by slotting them into different positions in their stratigraphical sequence. This created a <b>global</b> <b>approach</b> to dating the age of the Earth and allowed for further correlations to be drawn from similarities found in the makeup of the Earth’s crust in various countries.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{approach}} to performance prediction of OWL reasoners. The existing strategies take a view of an entire ontology corpus: they extract multiple fea-tures from the ontologies in the corpus and use them for training machine learning models. We call these <b>global</b> <b>approaches.</b> In contrast, our approach is a local one: it examines a single ontology (independent of any cor-pus), selects suitable, small ontology subsets, and ex-trapolates their performance measurements to the whole ontology. Our results show that this simple idea leads to accurate performance predictions, comparable or su-perior to <b>global</b> <b>approaches.</b> Our second contribution concerns ontology features: we {{are the first to}} investi-gate intercorrelation of ontology features using Princi-pal Component Analysis (PCA). We report that extract-ing multiple features- as <b>global</b> <b>approaches</b> do- makes surprisingly little difference for performance prediction.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} component-based {{framework}} for face detection and identification. The face detection and identification modules {{share the same}} hierarchical architecture. They both consist of two layers of classifiers, a layer {{with a set of}} component classifiers and a layer with a single combination classifier. The component classifiers independently detect/identify facial parts in the image. Their outputs are passed the combination classifier which performs the final detection/identification of the face. We describe an algorithm which automatically learns two separate sets of facial components for the detection and identification tasks. In experiments we compare the detection and identification systems to standard <b>global</b> <b>approaches.</b> The experimental results clearly show that our component-based approach is superior to <b>global</b> <b>approaches...</b>|$|R
30|$|Estimating depth {{from a pair}} of stereo {{images is}} a long-standing problem in {{computer}} vision. Its aim is to find a dense correspondence map between a pair of stereo images to generate either a disparity map (for rectified stereo pairs), or a depth map (for known camera calibration parameters). Stereo algorithms generally involve the following four steps: i) matching cost computation, (ii) cost aggregation, (iii) disparity computation or optimization, and (iv) disparity refinement [1]. Both local and <b>global</b> <b>approaches</b> need to perform the matching cost computation step, but they differ in the treatment of smoothness constraints. Local methods make implicit smoothness assumptions by aggregating costs within a finite window. <b>Global</b> <b>approaches,</b> by contrast, make explicit smoothness assumptions by combining the data and smoothness terms into a cost function, which is subsequently optimized using an iterative procedure. The most commonly used optimization methods for <b>global</b> <b>approaches</b> include Expectation-Maximum (EM) [2], cooperative optimization [3, 4], Graph Cuts (GC) [5], Max-Product Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) [6], and Tree-Reweighted Message Passing (TRW) [7]. The last three methods are categorized as energy minimization for Markov Random Fields (MRFs) [8]. In practical applications, local approaches are preferred to their global counterparts due to their speed and ease of implementation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} bottom up {{algebraic}} approach for segmenting multiple 2 D motion models {{directly from the}} partial derivatives of an image sequence. Our method fits a polynomial called the multibody brightness constancy constraint (MBCC) to a window around each pixel of the scene and obtains a local motion model from the derivatives of the MBCC. These local models are then clustered to obtain {{the parameters of the}} motion models for the entire scene. Motion segmentation is obtained by assigning to each pixel the dominant motion model in a window around it. Our approach requires no initialization, can handle multiple motions in a window (thus dealing with the aperture problem) and automatically incorporates spatial regularization. Therefore, it naturally combines the advantages of both local and <b>global</b> <b>approaches</b> to motion segmentation. Experiments on real data compare our method with previous local and <b>global</b> <b>approaches.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In 3 D object {{retrieval}} it is {{very important}} to define reliable shape descriptors, which compactly characterize geometric properties of the underlying surface. To this aim two main <b>approaches</b> are considered: <b>global,</b> and local ones. <b>Global</b> <b>approaches</b> are effective in describing the whole object, while local ones are more suitable to characterize small parts of the shape. Some strategies to combine these two approaches have been proposed recently but still no consolidate work is available in this field. With this paper we address this problem and propose a new method based on sparse coding techniques. A set of local shape descriptors are collected from the shape. Then a dictionary is trained as generative model. In this fashion the dictionary is used as global shape descriptor for shape retrieval purposes. Preliminary experiments are performed on a standard dataset by showing a drastic improvement of the proposed method in comparison with well known local-to-global and <b>global</b> <b>approaches...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} motion estimation, in general, is made {{difficult}} by large illumination variations and by motion discontinuities. In recent papers, we {{and others have}} proposed <b>global</b> <b>approaches</b> to deal with both problems simultaneously within the regularization framework. A major drawback of such global methods is that several regularization parameters responsible for {{the integration of the}} illumination and motion components need to be determined in advance. This has reduced the applicability of global methods. In this paper, a parameter-free local approach, which solves a linear regression problem using a simple parametric model, is presented. To achieve robustness for the linear regression problem, we introduce {{a modified version of the}} least median of squares algorithm. We show quantitative error comparisons between the results obtained by our local approach and those produced by several global methods. Our results show that our local method is comparable to the best results obtained by the <b>global</b> <b>approaches</b> yet does not require any manual selection of parameters. ...|$|R
