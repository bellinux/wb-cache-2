50|$|To have a {{well-developed}} flow pattern, pump manufacturer's manuals recommend about (10 diameters?) {{of straight}} pipe run upstream of the pump <b>inlet</b> <b>flange.</b> Unfortunately, piping designers and plant personnel {{must contend with}} space and equipment layout constraints and usually cannot comply with this recommendation. Instead, {{it is common to}} use an elbow close-coupled to the pump suction which creates a poorly developed flow pattern at the pump suction.|$|E
50|$|At first, Saab used a Garrett {{turbocharger}} (T3), {{which was}} oil-cooled. From 1988 through 1990, water-cooled T3s were fitted. In 1990, Saab fitted Mitsubishi TE-05 turbochargers in the SPG models {{only for the}} USA; for other countries, and for the USA from 1991, all 900 Turbos were fitted with the TE-05. Also water-cooled, the TE-05 was slightly smaller than the Garrett T3s, providing improved throttle response and quicker spool-up. The TE-05 is unique in that its exhaust <b>inlet</b> <b>flange</b> utilizes a Garrett T3 pattern.|$|E
50|$|Since all pumps require {{well-developed}} {{inlet flow}} {{to meet their}} potential, a pump may not perform or be as reliable as expected due to a faulty suction piping layout such as a close-coupled elbow on the <b>inlet</b> <b>flange.</b> When poorly developed flow enters the pump impeller, it strikes the vanes and is unable to follow the impeller passage. The liquid then separates from the vanes causing mechanical problems due to cavitation, vibration and performance problems due to turbulence and poor filling of the impeller. This results in premature seal, bearing and impeller failure, high maintenance costs, high power consumption, and less-than-specified head and/or flow.|$|E

40|$|During {{some tests}} of a one-cylinder engine, using gas oil (diesel engine oil, {{specific}} gravity 0. 86 at 60 F) with solid injection and compression ignition, {{it was found}} to be necessary to increase either the jacket water temperature or the compression pressure in order to start the engine. It was found that a sufficient increase in compression pressure could be obtained simply by attaching a long pipe to the <b>inlet</b> <b>flange</b> of the cylinder. However, since no data were available giving the values of the increase in compression pressure that might be expected from such a step-up, an investigation was made covering some engine speeds between 500 r. p. m. and 1800 r. p. m. The data obtained are included here in the form of curves. Although this data is not strictly applicable to another engine, it should give indications of what might be expected with such a set-up on an engine operating at similar speeds.

40|$|The gas-flow {{reduction}} factor {{of the second}} forward Differential Pumping Section (DPS 2 -F) for the KATRIN experiment was determined using a dedicated vacuum-measurement setup and by detailed molecular-flow simulation of the DPS 2 -F beam tube and of the measurement apparatus. In the measurement, non-radioactive test gases deuterium, helium, neon, argon and krypton were used, the input gas flow was provided by a commercial mass-flow controller, and the output flow was measured using a residual gas analyzer, in order to distinguish it from the outgassing background. The measured {{reduction factor}} with the empty beam tube {{at room temperature for}} gases with mass 4 is 1. 8 (4) E 4, which is in excellent agreement with the simulated value of 1. 6 E 4. The simulated reduction factor for tritium, based on the interpolated value for the capture factor at the turbo-molecular pump <b>inlet</b> <b>flange</b> is 2. 5 E 4. The difference with respect to the design value of 1 E 5 is due to the modifications in the beam tube geometry since the initial design, and can be partly recovered by reduction of the effective beam tube diameter.

40|$|LecturePg. 141 - 146 Oil-free screw (OFS) {{compressors}} {{are capable}} of producing high-pressure pulsations in the discharge gas stream, over a frequency range of 200 to 3000 Hz. The fundamental pressure pulsation {{is due to the}} opening cycle of the compressor lobes at the discharge porting and {{is referred to as the}} pocket passing frequency (PPF). Fatigue failures have been observed in discharge silencers/pulsation dampers as well as downstream piping components in oil-free screw compressor service where the frequencies were greater than 1000 Hz. A careful review of the pulsation damper design has shown that attenuation effectiveness is limited to frequencies less than 1000 Hz. The principal purpose of the pulsation damper is to reduce the line pressure pulsations in order to lessen the chances of downstream piping failures. The pulsation damper does very little to attenuate high frequency noise levels that are transmitted to the area surrounding the compressor. The principal purpose of this paper is to document failures of silencer/pulsation dampers in OFS compressor service and provide a root cause analysis of these failure modes. Pulsation dampers are not used at the <b>inlet</b> <b>flange</b> in many applications, due to the lowpressure pulsation in the inlet plenum of the compressor. It is not the intent of this paper to present any theoretical background in the design of acoustic dampers, but to provide an overview of the acoustic phenomenon and how it is used in screw compressor applications. The end result of this work will be to provide practical guidelines for specifying silencer/pulsation dampers for OFS compressor applications...|$|E

Cermet 75 Cr 3 C 2 - 25 Ni(Cr) coatings based on Cr 3 C 2 carbides are widely used to protect parts as they retain high values of hardness, strength and resistance to wear up to a temperature of 850 °C. This paper discusses the influence of the parameters of the plasma spray deposition of 75 Cr 3 C 2 - 25 Ni(Cr) powder on the structure and mechanical properties of the coating. The powder is deposited using plasma spraying at atmospheric pressure (APS). The plasma gas is He, which is an inert gas and does not react with the powder; it produces dense plasma with lower heat content and less incorporated ambient air in the plasma jet thus reducing temperature decomposition and decarburization of Cr 3 C 2 carbide [...] In this study, three groups of coatings were deposited with three different powder feed rates of: 30, 45 and 60 g/min. The  coating with the best properties was deposited on the <b>inlet</b> <b>flange</b> parts of the turbo - jet engine TV 2 - 117 A to reduce the influence of vibrations and wear. The structures and the mechanical properties of 75 Cr 3 C 2 - 25 Ni(Cr) coatings are analyzed in accordance with the Pratt & Whitney standard. Studies have shown that powder feed rates have an important influence on the mechanical properties and structures of 75 Cr 3 C 2 - 25 Ni(Cr) coatings.   <! [...] [endif] [...] ...|$|E
40|$|LectureLecture 4 : The {{gas flow}} {{entering}} from the <b>inlet</b> <b>flange</b> of a centrifugal compressor may induce radial {{forces on the}} rotor, by directly impinging onto shaft or by generating asymmetric pressure fluctuations in the gas volume surrounding the shaft. This aerodynamic excitation represents a potential source of radial vibrations for the rotor; it {{is characterized by a}} broad-band, low frequency spectrum and its effects are typically observed to increase when the operating point moves towards the top right part of the operating envelope, i. e. at high operating speed and high inlet flowrate. The severity of the vibrations caused by this airborne excitation depends on the thermodynamic parameters of the inlet gas (flowrate, velocity, density) and on the mechanical design of the compressor (geometry of the suction volume, stiffness of rotor and journal bearings). While the former are generally constrained by process requirements, the latter can be optimized in order to minimize the induced vibrations. Moreover, a very effective way to mitigate this phenomenon is the adoption of Inlet Guide Vanes at compressor suction that can protect the shaft from exciting forces; on the other hand the installation of IGVs increases the cost and the mechanical complexity of the design, and may also have a non-negligible impact on performances, causing a pressure loss. For this reason it is useful to define a screening criterion to decide whether to install IGVs, based on the predicted sensitivity of the rotor to inlet gas flow excitation. Such criterion was developed basing on physical considerations and then validated through application to a set of recorded references from compressors tested in full load. The outcome allowed to build a diagram based on compressor geometry and operating data, where a boundary line separates the safe area (no significant vibration expected) from the area where the application of IGVs is suggested...|$|E
