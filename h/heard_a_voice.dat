5|$|The king, {{after getting}} {{suspicious}} of her actions, once {{followed her to}} a sadhu’s place, with a dagger in his cloak. Once he reached the ashram, he {{found that there was}} no one inside. To his surprise, both the sadhu and his daughter Champavati had vanished. When he was about to return, he <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> saying that his daughter had been taken away as a punishment of his suspicion. The voice also asked him to build a temple, on the name of his daughter Champavati, if he wanted to avoid further familial calamities.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of this origin of Chamba {{is that it}} originated as a hermitage which Champavati, a devout Hindu, used to frequent. The king, being suspicious of his daughter's fidelity, one day investigated and followed her to the hermitage, but surprisingly he found neither his daughter nor the hermit there. Suddenly he {{was said to have}} <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> which informed him that his suspicions were ill-founded, admonishing him and informing him that his daughter had been taken away from him permanently as a punishment for his lack of trust in her morals. The King, fully chastened, sought redemption for his sin by expanding the hermitage into a temple, named in his daughter’s honour and built a city around the temple. Today this temple, called the Champavati Temple, belongs to the Royal family and the King’s daughter is venerated as a goddess. Every year, since 935, the Minjar festival or fair has been held. It lasts for 21 days, coinciding with the first day of Baisakhi.|$|E
5|$|Horses appear {{frequently}} in accounts concerning miraculous {{events in the}} context of Anglo-Saxon Christianity. In the 7th century, a horse is reported to have revealed warm bread and some meat when St Cuthbert was hungry, by pulling straw from the roof of a hut; and, when Cuthbert was suffering from a diseased knee, he was visited by an angel on horseback, who helped him to heal his knee. In the 8th century, the Anglo-Saxon Bishop Willibald of Eichstätt wrote that, when a source of fresh water was needed for a monastery on the site where St Boniface had died, in the kingdom of Frisia, the ground gave way under the forelegs of a horse, and, when the horse was pulled free, a fountain of spring water came out of the ground and formed a brook. In the 10th century, King Edmund I is reported to have been saved from death while chasing a deer on horseback when he prayed for forgiveness for his maltreatment of St Dunstan, and thereafter made him abbot of Glastonbury: the horse stopped {{at the edge of a}} cliff, over which the deer and hunting dogs had already fallen. On a later occasion, a horse fell dead under Dunstan when he <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> from heaven telling him that King Eadred had died.|$|E

25|$|This {{conclusion}} was challenged {{in the same}} journal by James R. Brorson and Kathleen Brewer, who stated that this hypothesis failed to explain why Paul's companions <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> (Acts 9:7), saw a light, or fell to the ground. Furthermore, no lack of awareness of blindness (a characteristic of cortical blindness) was reported in Acts, {{nor is there any}} indication of memory loss. Additionally, Paul's blindness remitted in sudden fashion, rather than the gradual resolution typical of post-ictal states, and no mention is made of epileptic convulsions; indeed such convulsions may, in Paul's time, have been interpreted as a sign of demonic influence, unlikely in someone accepted as a religious leader.|$|E
25|$|By late August 871, 'Ali ibn Muhammad {{decided that}} Basra {{had been reduced}} to the point where a {{full-fledged}} assault was possible, and began preparing for an attack. A message was sent to 'Ali ibn Aban, recalling him from Jubba and ordering him to proceed against the city, while Yahya ibn Muhammad, who was then conducting the blockade, received a similar command. A man was sent to the nearby Arab tribes in an effort to convince them to join the attack; many of them agreed to do so and a second man was sent to train them for the operation. 'Ali ibn Muhammad was also encouraged by his astrologers' predictions that a lunar eclipse would occur on September 4; he began speaking to his followers, declaring that he had prayed to God and <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> which said that the eclipse heralded the imminent destruction of Basra.|$|E
25|$|In a rocky {{wilderness}} Morald and Gunther meet Gernot. The former pair {{have been}} sent to find out what has happened to Arindal, who disappeared eight years ago. In the meantime his father, the king, has died from grief and the kingdom is being attacked by their enemy Murold who demands they surrender Arindal's sister Lora as his wife. Gernot relates how he and Arindal had hunted a beautiful doe to a river where it vanished. They <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> and jumped into the river where they found a beautiful woman in luxurious surroundings. She declared her love for Arindal and said they could stay together provided Arindal could go eight years without asking who she is. But the day before he did ask her, and Arindal and Gernot found themselves in the wilderness. Morald and Gunther depart before Arindal can know of their presence. Arindal appears and sings of his grief at the loss of Ada (Wo find ich dich, wo wird mir Trost?). Gernot tries to argue him round to believing that Ada is a sorceress who has abandoned him and that he should return to his kingdom. He sings of an evil witch who had disguised herself as a beautiful woman (War einst 'ne böse Hexe wohl). Gunther returns, disguised as a priest, and continues the attempt to persuade Arindal that he will be turned into a wild beast by the witch unless he returns at once; Morald similarly disguises himself as the ghost of Arindal's father and announces that his kingdom is threatened. Each disguise is magically destroyed just as Arindal is about to be convinced. However, the three are finally able to persuade him of his country's need. They agree to depart in the morning, although Arindal fears he will not see Ada again. When he is left alone he falls into an enchanted sleep.|$|E

500|$|Branham {{claimed he}} was baptizing {{converts}} on June 11, 1933 in the Ohio River near Jeffersonville when people along the bank saw a bright light descend over where he was and that he <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> say, [...] "As John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Jesus Christ, so your message will forerun His second coming." [...] The only available newspaper report of Branham's activities at this time {{was that of the}} Jeffersonville Evening News on June 2, which indicated that the Branham campaign reported 14 converts. Given the lack of corroborating evidence for this supposed supernatural event it is possible that Branham later embellished the incident by [...] "remembering" [...] the forerunner message when he was achieving success in the healing revival.|$|E
500|$|Despite his {{successful}} media career, Icke wrote that 1989 {{was a time}} of considerable personal despair, and it was during this period that he said he began to feel a presence around him. He often describes how he felt it while alone in a hotel room in March 1990, and finally asked: [...] "If there is anybody here, will you please contact me because you are driving me up the wall!" [...] Days later, in a newsagent's in Ryde, he felt a force pull his feet to the ground, he wrote, and <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> guide him toward some books. One of them was Mind to Mind (1989) by Betty Shine, a psychic healer in Brighton. He read the book, then wrote to her requesting a consultation about his arthritis.|$|E

[...] Lhermitte mailed two letters: a letter with jewelry for her sisters, and the other letter to her friend Valerie.

She also accused her husband of being [...] "deaf" [...] and [...] "blind" [...] to her concerns regarding Dr. Schaar. After mailing the letters, she went to a grocery store and slipped two knives into her shopping bag.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{official}} Zanzibari history, the revolution was planned and headed by the ASP leader Abeid Amani Karume. However, at the time Karume was on the African mainland as {{was the leader of}} the banned Umma Party, Abdulrahman Muhammad Babu. The ASP branch secretary for Pemba, Ugandan-born ex-policeman John Okello, had sent Karume to the mainland to ensure his safety. Okello had arrived in Zanzibar from Kenya in 1959, claiming to have been a field marshal for the Kenyan rebels during the Mau Mau Uprising, although he actually had no military experience. He maintained that he <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> commanding him, as a Christian, to free the Zanzibari people from the Muslim Arabs, and it was Okello who led the revolutionaries—mainly unemployed members of the Afro-Shirazi Youth League—on 12 January. One commentator has further speculated that it was probably Okello, with the Youth League, who planned the revolution. There appears to have been three different plots to overthrow the government, led by Karume, Babu and Okello, of which the latter was the most advanced and it was he who struck the blow that brought down the Sultan's regime. Okello was not widely known in Zanzibar, and the government was more concerned with monitoring the ASP and Umma rather a little-known and barely literate house painter and minor union official. Okello was a complete mystery to the world {{at the time of the}} revolution, and MI5 reported to Whitehall that he was an ex-policeman who fought with the Mau Mau in Kenya and had been trained in Cuba in the art of revolutionary violence. Okello himself at a press conference several days later angrily denied having ever been to Cuba or China, stating that he was a Christian whose motto was [...] "Everything can be learned from the Bible".|$|E
