Microfluidic-based platforms that provide unattended manipulation of adherent cells promise to be an appropriate basis for cell manipulation. In this study we developed a magnetically driven cell carrier to serve as a vehicle within an in vitro environment. To elucidate the impact of the carrier on cells, biocompatibility was estimated using the human adenocarcinoma cell line Caco- 2. Besides evaluation {{of the quality of the}} magnetic carriers by field emission scanning electron microscopy, the rate of adherence, proliferation and differentiation of Caco- 2 cells grown on the carriers was quantified. Moreover, the morphology of the cells was monitored by immunofluorescent staining. Early generations of the cell carrier suffered from release of cytotoxic nickel from the magnetic cushion. Biocompatibility was achieved by complete encapsulation of the nickel bulk within <b>galvanic</b> gold. The <b>insulation</b> process had to be developed stepwise and was controlled by parallel monitoring of the cell viability. The final carrier generation proved to be a proper support for cell manipulation, allowing proliferation of Caco- 2 cells equal to that on glass or polystyrene as a reference for up to 10 days. Functional differentiation was enhanced by more than 30 % compared with the reference. A flat, ferromagnetic and fully biocompatible carrier for cell manipulation was developed for application in microfluidic systems.

40|$|Similar to {{low-voltage}} power systems, also {{in medium}} voltage networks {{there is a}} growing need for power quality (PQ) analyses, required by the increasing diffusion of distributed generation sources equipped with switching converters. This leads to the employment of transducers and measurement techniques able to convert and acquire voltage signals with better accuracy on a wider frequency range than conventional voltage and current instrument transformers. Voltage dividers (VDs) are expected to become the most used transducers in PQ assessments, since, with respect to conventional voltage transformers, they show higher frequency bandwidth and better linearity. The main disadvantage of the VDs is the absence of <b>galvanic</b> <b>insulation</b> between the transducer and the measurement/protection devices. Therefore, in this paper, a prototype of a VD for phase-to-ground connection with an insulating transmission system is presented. It is constituted by a high-impedance resistive–capacitive VD and by an analog electronic insulation interface.

This paper presents an application of the five-level common-emitter current-source inverter (CE-CSI) for grid connected photovoltaic system without batteries as energy storage system. In the proposed system, the five-level CE-CSI works generating a sinusoidal output current from photovoltaic system to be injected into the power grid.

40|$|During {{the last}} years, {{it has been}} {{possible}} to witness a steady and progressive increase of energy production from renewable resources. In particular, the greatest increment has been registered for photovoltaic applications, due to the possibility to install low power implants easily integrated in the urban ambient, the so-called domestic photovoltaic. A photovoltaic system can be islanded, when the energy is extracted from the panels for supplying local loads, {{as in the case}} of remote agricultural areas, or grid-connected, where the energy recovered from the panels is directly injected into the mains. Until now, where there was the possibility, grid-connected system has been considered the easiest and most efficient solution for photovoltaic plants. 	 Following these considerations, in the last years there has been a remarkable proliferation, in both academic and industrial field, of new solutions for grid-connected inverters that were designed to maximize efficiency and reliability. Initially, grid-connected inverters were realized employing a line frequency transformer, which, establishing a <b>galvanic</b> <b>insulation</b> between the photovoltaic source and the grid, facilitated the design issues. Nevertheless, because of its bulky dimension, costs, and additional power losses, the use of transformers was progressively abandoned. Nowadays transformerless inverters are the most efficient grid-connected converters commercialized and some companies arrive to claim values of 98 % of efficiency for their products. Nevertheless, the absence of a <b>galvanic</b> <b>insulation</b> between the photovoltaic source and the grid gives rise to issues, such us ground leakage currents and possible DC current injection into the grid that must be addressed. The ground leakage current phenomenon was proven to be due to the presence of a parasitic capacitance between the PV cells and the metal structure of the panels, usually grounded for safety reason. A survey of the actual solutions to avoid the arising of ground leakage current in transformerless single-phase systems was elaborated in this work, and a novel classification for transformerless inverters was proposed as well. The principal causes of ground leakage current were investigated, and the contribution to the phenomenon of the common-mode voltage generated at the output of the grid-connected inverters during their operation was analyzed. In fact the common-mode voltage at the output of the converters generates currents that flow in the parasitic capacitance throughout the connection to the ground of the neutral wire of the grid at the MV/LV transformer. For this reason the ground leakage current is also known as common-mode current. A novel approach to cancel the common-mode voltage variations at the output of a transformerless grid-connected converter was proposed. This solution relies on an active common-mode filter connected at the output of the power converter. It is constituted by a common-mode transformer properly supplied by a low-power full-bridge. The proposed solution is applicable to both stand-alone and grid-connected converters. In particular in this work the active filter was applied to a full-bridge power converter topology driven by the efficient 3 -level (unipolar) PWM. The feasibility of the proposed solution and the capacity to operate with power factor different from one was proven through extensive simulations in Simulink/Plecs environment, and confirmed with experimental results. On this purpose, a converter prototype was designed and built. It embeds all the components for enabling the connection to the mains in accordance to the Italian legislation CEI 0 - 21...|$|E
40|$|Implanted neurostimulators are {{commonly}} used to activate peripheral nerves or brain cells through one or more electrodes. Because of the variable conditions, the stimulation parameters required to obtain the seeked effect vary from subject to subject {{and from time to}} time in the same subject. Sensing the evoked compound action potential is therefore an important aspect of neural stimulation. However, physiological signals are typically in the mu V to mV range and generated at a short distance from stimulating pulses with magnitudes 3 to 6 orders larger. Anatomical and surgical constraints typically do not allow the stimulation and recording location to be separated by large distances. There is a pressing demand to combine both features in a single electrode. Avoiding a prolonged amplifier saturation induced by the huge stimulation artefact becomes a major challenge. Because of the geometrical proximity between the electrode contacts, the response to be recorded is often expected to emerge within no more than one ms after the stimulus, putting even more emphasis on the required fast amplifier recovery. A last challenge is the fact that the stimulator and recording electronics must be integrated to reduce the size of an implant. The <b>galvanic</b> <b>insulation</b> usually exploited to further reduce stimulation artefacts cannot be applied here. In this paper, we describe a recording circuit sharing common power supplies with a neuro-stimulator. The circuit features an specific artefact suppression system based on highpass filter switching and ac coupling. It is further completed with digital filtering and noise rejection algorithms including the possibility to average responses to repeated stimuli in order to improve signal to noise ratio when necessary.
