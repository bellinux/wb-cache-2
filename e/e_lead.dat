40|$|The neural cell {{adhesion}} molecule (N-CAM) has an unusually high amount of sialic acid (28 - 35 g/ 100 g of polypeptide) and shows microheterogeneity in electrophoretic gels in its embryonic or E form. During development, the molecule undergoes conversion to several adult or A forms, which resemble the E form but which on the average have only 10 % sialic acid and {{do not appear to}} be microheterogeneous. In the present study, rabbit antibodies to mouse N-CAM and two different monoclonal antibodies were used to follow the <b>E</b> <b>leads</b> to A conversion in normal and mutant mice. <b>E</b> <b>leads</b> to A conversion to three forms (Mr 180, 000, Mr 140, 000, and Mr 120, 000) was found to occur at different rates in different parts of the brains of wild-type mice. Examination of the entire cerebellum of the granuloprival mouse mutant staggerer (sg/sg) showed that the <b>E</b> <b>leads</b> to A conversion did not occur by 21 days after birth, whereas in wild type it was almost complete at that time. There was also some delay in <b>E</b> <b>leads</b> to A conversion within the cerebral cortex of sg/sg, although phenotypically no evidence of cortical disorder has been detected. In pooled tissues from phenotypically normal-appearing littermates, (i. e., a mixture of sg/+ and +/+), a slight conversion delay was also found in cerebellum and cortex. The mutants weaver, reeler, and jimpy all showed normal schedules of <b>E</b> <b>leads</b> to A conversion. These observations raise the possibility that a major defect in staggerer mutants relates to a failure in local surface modulation of N-CAM to produce the A forms of the molecule. Some of the failures of synapse formation and of cell survival seen in this disease may result from the anomaly, which is likely to alter the binding properties of N-CAM at critical times of development...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{relation}} between the different forms of inseparability in quantum mechanics is a longstanding problem in the foundations of quantum theory and has implications for quantum information processing.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the problem of}} energy-aware {{resource}} allocation for hosting long-term services or on-demand compute jobs in clusters, e. g., deployed as part of computing infrastructures. We formalize the problem as three constrained optimization problems: maximize job performance under power consumption constraints, minimize power consumption under job performance constraints, and optimize a linear combination of power consumption and job performance. These problems are NP-hard but, given an instance, a bound on the optimal solution can be computed via a rational linear program. We propose polynomial heuristics for all three problems. Simulation experiments show that in all three cases some heuristics can achieve results close to optimal, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>lead</b> to good job performance while conserving energy. 1...|$|E
