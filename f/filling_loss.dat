This result is based on shaped dithered lattice quantization in the limit as the lattice dimension tends to infinity and holds for all positive distortions. It turns out that this uncorrelated distortion RDF can be realized causally. This feature, which stands in contrast to Shannon’s RDF, is illustrated by causal transform coding. Moreover, we prove that by using feedback noise shaping the uncorrelated distortion RDF can be achieved causally and with memoryless entropy coding.

Restrictions on vaporization loss of petroleum products give added emphasis to the accurate prediction of vapor pressure and hydrocarbon losses for petroleum products. In this work, firstly, a simple-to-use correlation is developed to estimate the true vapor pressure of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gasoline as a function of Reid Vapor pressure (RVP) and temperature as well as the vapor pressure of different mixtures of propane and butane are correlated as a function of ambient air temperature and propane volume percent. Secondly, the <b>filling</b> <b>losses</b> from storage containers are estimated in percentage of liquid pumped in tanks as a function of working pressure and vapor pressure at liquid temperature. The study showed the proposed method to be in good agreement with the available reliable data in the literature. The average absolute deviation between reported data and the proposed correlation is less than 2 %. The proposed simple-to-use approach can be of significant practical value for the process engineers and scientists to have a quick check on the prediction of the displacement losses from storage containers as well as for rapid estimation of vapor pressure of LPG and natural gasoline...|$|R

40|$|Grain {{quality is}} an {{important}} agricultural trait that is mainly determined by grain size and composition. Here, we characterize {{the role of the}} rice transcription factor (TF) SALT-RESPONSIVE ERF 1 (SERF 1) during grain development. Through genome-wide expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that SERF 1 directly regulates RICE PROLAMIN-BOX BINDING FACTOR (RPBF), a TF that functions as a positive regulator of grain <b>filling.</b> <b>Loss</b> of SERF 1 enhances RPBF expression resulting in larger grains with increased starch content, while SERF 1 overexpression represses RPBF resulting in smaller grains. Consistently, during grain filling, starch biosynthesis genes such as GRANULE-BOUND STARCH SYNTHASEI (GBSSI), STARCH SYNTHASEI (SSI), SSIIIa, and ADP-GLUCOSE PYROPHOSPHORYLASE LARGE SUBUNIT 2 (AGPL 2) are up-regulated in SERF 1 knockout grains. Moreover, SERF 1 is a direct upstream regulator of GBSSI. In addition, SERF 1 negatively regulates germination by controlling RPBF expression, which mediates the gibberellic acid (GA) -induced expression of RICE AMYLASE 1 A (RAmy 1 A). Loss of SERF 1 results in more rapid seedling establishment, while SERF 1 overexpression has the opposite effect. Our study reveals that SERF 1 represents a negative regulator of grain filling and seedling establishment by timing the expression of RPBF. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

Patient screening of the pedodontic department of Charité - Universitäts¬medizin Berlin between 2006 and 2014. 48 children fulfilled following criteria: generally healthy, aged 5 - 12 years, having received either a compomer filling (Dyract AP, Dentsply, Konstanz/Twinky Star, VOCO, Cuxhaven) and/or ≥ 1 SSC (3 M Medica, Borken), restorations at least 12 months in situ. ICDAS, Gingival Index (SBI) and Plaque Index (API) were recorded. All clinical findings of a patient were always established on the same day. A standardized investigation sheet was applied. Restorations were assessed by using DIAGNOcam (KaVo, Biberach) and modified USPHS-criteria. Follow-up examinations were performed by one dentist (L. H.), who was calibrated in terms of ICDAS before. Study {{was approved by the}} Ethics Commitee of Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany (trial registration no. EA 2 / 113 / 13). Informed oral and written, parents gave consent. 145 restorations, including 56 (38. 6 %) class-I-, 89 (61. 4 %) class-II-compomer fillings and 31 SSCs, were evaluated. All analyses were performed with SPSS (SPSS Statistics 22, IBM, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess a significant difference between oral hygiene status, cavity class, patient age, concerned primary molar, type of compomer and survival time of restorations. Pearsonʼs chi-square test was used to assess a significant difference in oral hygiene status of SSC and filling group. Significance level was set at 5 %. Overall success rate of SSCs was 93. 5 %, of compomer fillings 74. 5 %. Secondary caries (21. 4 %, n = 31) and <b>filling</b> <b>loss</b> (4. 1 %, n = 6) were scored as clinical failures. Overall failure rate of SSCs was 6. 5 % (one perforated crown and one with insufficient margin). Survival time of class II restorations was significantly shorter (p < 0. 05) than for class I restorations. Duration of survival time was not significantly associated with patients age at treatment date (R² = 0. 12). SSCs are more successful restorations in primary molars and guarantee long-lasting clinical success regardless of patient age or oral hygiene status. Decision for compomer restoration instead of SSC implicates more frequent clinical check-ups as well as post-treatments. In clinical cases of advanced proximal caries lesions SSCs should be preferred. At appropriate indication (class I cavities, small class II cavities) compomer restorations achieve good clinical success rates, too...|$|E

30|$|Charge {{exchange}} {{is one of}} the dominant loss process for the ring current ions (Dessler and Parker 1959). The charge exchange frequently occurs where neutral atoms are dense, such as low L-shells, and low altitude. According to an empirical model (Rairden et al. 1986), the geocorona density is 660  cm− 3 at geocentric distance of 3 Re. At L[*]=[*] 3, the charge exchange lifetime for H+ is 4  h at 10  keV, and 96  h at 100  keV. For O+, it is 16  h at 10  keV, and 11  h at 100  keV (Ebihara and Ejiri 2003). As the ion travels toward Northern Hemisphere, or Southern Hemisphere along a field line, the ion undergoes short lifetime because of dense neutral atoms. Therefore, the lifetime depends on the equatorial pitch angle. The two-step recovery of Dst is attributed to the lifetime depending on ionic species. On the basis of the observation that O+ dominates H+ in the storm-time ring current, it is suggested that the first rapid recovery is caused by the charge exchange of O+, followed by the slow recovery caused by the charge exchange of H+ (Hamilton et al. 1988). Numerical simulation, however, shows that the charge {{exchange is}} insufficient to explain the rapid recovery, and that precipitation into the ionosphere is necessary (Kozyra et al. 1998 a). Kozyra et al. (1998 a) pointed out that in addition to charge exchange, the precipitation loss is significant for the rapid recovery of Dst. This is supported by the evidence of a <b>filled</b> <b>loss</b> cone observed by satellites (Amundsen et al. 1972; Williams and Lyons 1974; Hultqvist et al. 1976; Sergeev et al. 1983; Walt and Voss 2001).

40|$|In {{cooling towers}} packed with trickle or splash fills, which have almost {{isotropic}} or anisotropic flow resistance, the air {{flow through the}} fill is oblique or in cross-counterflow to the water flow, particularly at the cooling tower inlet when the <b>fill</b> <b>loss</b> coefficient is small or when the fill hangs down into the air inlet region. This results that the fill Merkel number or transfer characteristic for cross-counter flow is between that of purely counter- and crossflow fills. When using CFD to model natural draught wet-cooling tower performance for isotropic fill resistance, two- or three-dimensional models are therefore required to determine fill performance. In this paper, the governing fundamental partial differential equations are derived in cylindrical and Cartesian co-ordinates to determine the cooling water temperature, water evaporation rate, air temperature and air humidity ratio in two-dimensional cross-counterflow fills for both saturated and supersaturated air. To solve these equations, a relation is proposed to determine Merkel numbers for oblique air flows by linear interpolation and extrapolation of purely cross- and counterflow Merkel numbers {{in terms of the}} air flow angle. This model is compared to analytical Merkel numbers obtained for different air flow angles using a single drop trajectory model. A linear upwind computational model and an Eulerian FLUENT® model are developed to evaluate fill performance characteristics from test data and to model fill performance in cooling towers respectively. The results of these two models are compared and verified with a FLUENT® Euler-Lagrange model. © 2010 by ASME...|$|R
