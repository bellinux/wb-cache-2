On the February 6 episode of Raw, Goldberg would accept Lesnar's challenge whilst also being named number one contender for Kevin Owens' Universal Championship, which he won at Fastlane thus turning his match with Lesnar into a title match. At WrestleMania 33, Lesnar beat Goldberg to win his fifth world title in WWE and {{the first man to}} have won both the WWE Championship and Universal Championship. Lesnar also became the second person to kick-out from Goldberg's <b>Jackhammer</b> and gave him the first clean singles loss of his professional wrestling career. After several weeks of feuding, Lesnar's first title defense came at the inaugural Great Balls of Fire event on July 9, 2017, where he successfully retained against Samoa Joe, before defeating him a second time for the title at a live event.|$|E

5|$|The third contest was a tag team match, {{in which}} The World's Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas) faced the APA (Bradshaw and Faarooq). At one point, Bradshaw {{performed}} a Clothesline from Hell on Haas. Benjamin then delivered a superkick to Bradshaw and pinned him {{to gain the}} win for his team. After the match, Goldberg was seen arriving at the arena and being escorted to his seat by arena security. In the ring, General Manager Paul Heyman gave a promotional in-ring segment on how SmackDown! was the better program over Raw. Lesnar would {{come down to the}} ring to promote his match and to insult Goldberg. As part of the storyline, Goldberg immediately jumped over the barricade into the ring, where Lesnar performed a spear on Goldberg however he recuperated and delivered a <b>Jackhammer</b> to Lesnar. Goldberg was then escorted out of the arena by security.|$|E
5|$|The Lennons {{were married}} on 23 August 1962 at the Mount Pleasant Register office in Liverpool. Fellow Beatles McCartney and George Harrison were in attendance, as was their manager, Brian Epstein, who was best man; no parents were there. The wedding was farcical, because {{as soon as}} the {{ceremony}} began a workman in the backyard of the building opposite started using a <b>jackhammer</b> which drowned out anything the registrar, Lennon, or Powell said. When the registrar asked for the groom to step forward, Harrison stepped forward instead. With no photographs or flowers the wedding party celebrated afterwards, at Epstein's invitation, in Reece's restaurant in Clayton Square, which was the same restaurant where Lennon's parents, Alfred Lennon and Julia Lennon, had celebrated their marriage in 1938. Lennon was 21 years old, and Powell 22. The newlyweds had no honeymoon, as Lennon had to play an engagement at the Riverpark Ballroom in Chester the same night, although they did travel to the Hotel George V in Paris, for a belated honeymoon on 16 September, but were accompanied by Epstein, even though he had not been invited to join them.|$|E
5|$|Lesnar {{defended the}} WWE Championship against Eddie Guerrero at No Way Out on February 15. Goldberg {{attacked}} Lesnar with a spear while the referee was unconscious, allowing Guerrero to pin Lesnar for a near-fall. Lesnar then attempted an F-5 on Guerrero but Guerrero reversed {{it into a}} DDT on the title belt and executed a frog splash to win the WWE Championship. An angry Lesnar then began feuding with Goldberg, blaming him for losing his title, and a match was set up between the two at WrestleMania XX on March 14. During the feud with Goldberg, Lesnar was also at odds with Stone Cold Steve Austin, who was shown suggesting to Goldberg that he attack Lesnar at No Way Out. After Lesnar attacked Austin on Raw and stole his four-wheeler, Austin was inserted as the special guest referee for the WrestleMania match. On the March 4 episode of SmackDown!, Lesnar defeated Hardcore Holly in his last match on a weekly WWE televised show. Behind the scenes, it was widely known that the match was Goldberg's last in WWE. Only a week before WrestleMania, rumors surfaced that Lesnar too was leaving {{to pursue a career}} in the National Football League (NFL). As a result, Lesnar's match with Goldberg became a fiasco as the fans at Madison Square Garden jeered and heckled both professional wrestlers vociferously. Goldberg won after a <b>Jackhammer</b> and both men subsequently received Stone Cold Stunners from Austin.|$|E

Goldberg then performed a spear on Lesnar through the barricade into the timekeepers area. Goldberg got Lesnar back into the ring and attempted a <b>Jackhammer,</b> but Lesnar countered and attempted an F-5 on Goldberg, who also countered and performed another spear, followed by a <b>Jackhammer</b> on Lesnar, who became {{the first man to}} kick-out of the spear-Jackhammer combo. Goldberg attempted a fifth spear, but Lesnar avoided Goldberg and performed seven more German suplexes on him. Lesnar then performed an F-5 on Goldberg to win his first Universal Championship and gave Goldberg his first clean singles loss of his career.

25|$|The {{problem was}} caused by heavy rain over the weekend prior to the game, which made the dirt in the sliding pits and pitcher's mound so soft that the cutouts {{covering}} them in the football configuration became mushy and uneven. Even when new dirt was shoveled on top, it quickly became just as saturated as the old dirt. The problem was solved by using asphalt hot mix, which allowed for a solid, level playing surface, but required a <b>jackhammer</b> for removal whenever the stadium was converted from football back to baseball (between August and October of each year).|$|E

25|$|The {{secondary}} feud {{heading in}} to Sin, was between Goldberg and Buff Bagwell. This feud began at Mayhem, where Goldberg hit a spear on the referee by accident after Luger pushed {{him in his}} place. Although this {{would have resulted in}} a disqualification, Goldberg won the match after a <b>jackhammer.</b> Luger would claim that Goldberg had lost via disqualification, which led to his desire of ending Goldberg's undefeated winning streak. This feud carried over to Starrcade where Goldberg's career was on the line, as he would be forced to retire if he had lost, although Goldberg was victorious. Lex Luger and Buff Bagwell would then form the tag team of Totally Buffed in December 2000, where they got Goldberg's WCW Power Plant trainer, DeWayne Bruce, involved in the feud leading to a match between the two sides at Sin.|$|E
