60|$|Why {{does the}} dream-process act so? For two reasons. First, the reason of simple {{automatic}} continuance. The mother-image {{was the first}} great emotional image to be introduced in the psyche. The dream-process mechanically reproduces its stock image the moment the intense sympathy-emotion is aroused. Again, the mother-image refers only to the upper plane. But the dream-process is mechanical in its logic. Because the mother-image refers to the great <b>dynamic</b> <b>stress</b> of the upper plane, therefore {{it refers to the}} great <b>dynamic</b> <b>stress</b> of the lower. This is a piece of sheer automatic logic. The living soul is not automatic, and automatic logic does not apply to it.|$|E
40|$|A central {{problem in}} studies of fault {{interaction}} and earthquake triggering is that of quantifying changes in frictional strength and constitutive response caused by <b>dynamic</b> <b>stressing.</b> Earthquake-induced stress changes can trigger fault slip, cause changes in seismicity rate, and lead to additional damaging earthquakes. To date, studies of stress triggering have focused primarily on static stresses and simple failure models. However, <b>dynamic</b> <b>stresses</b> are also expected {{to be important in}} earthquake triggering, particularly at large distances from the mainshock. Moreover, studies of fault interaction and stress transfer commonly find that triggered seismicity is delayed relative to the arrival of <b>dynamic</b> or static <b>stresses.</b> Such delays are not predicted by simple, Coulomb failure models. Recent theoretical work shows that <b>dynamic</b> <b>stressing</b> can lead to destabilization of creeping faults and resonant behavior, characterized by large amplitude stick-slip instabilities. Numerical models are available to study <b>dynamic</b> <b>stressing</b> and their role in earthquake triggering and fault interaction. However, the laboratory data necessary to carry out such studies have been sparse. Laboratory data are needed to account for changes in fault strength and to understand the effects of <b>dynamic</b> <b>stresses</b> on frictional strength and stability.

The New Austrian Tunnelling method (NATM) was used. To be able to keep the tunnel open to workday railroad traffic, the repairs had to be performed during operational breaks at night and on weekends. To do this, the floor and arch were constructed in 8 m sections.|$|E
50|$|It {{follows that}} initially, only W and Δ {{should be taken}} into account for the {{morphological}} design of a structure, assuming that it is ultra-dampened (i.e. its internal damping is greater than the critical damping), which makes it impervious to <b>dynamic</b> <b>stress.</b> The volume V of a structure is therefore directly proportional to the total intensity of the force F which is applied to it, to its length L and to the morphological factor W; it is inversely proportional to the stress σ to which it can be subjected. Furthermore, the weight of a structure is proportional to the density ρ of the material from which it is constructed. However, its maximum displacement δ remains proportional to the span L and the morphological factor Δ, as well as the ratio between its working stress σ and the modulus of elasticity E.|$|E

40|$|Engineering {{assessments}} of ground failure potential commonly express seismic demands {{in the form}} of shear stresses or normalizations thereof.

5000|$|In some dialects of Norwegian, mainly {{those from}} Nordmøre and Trøndelag to Lofoten, {{there may also}} be tonal {{opposition}} in monosyllables, as in [...] ('car') vs. [...] ('axe'). In a few dialects, mainly in and near Nordmøre, the monosyllabic tonal opposition is also represented in final syllables with secondary stress, as well as double tone designated to single syllables of primary stress in polysyllabic words. In practice, this means that one gets minimal pairs like: [...] ('the rooster') vs. [...] ('get him inside'); [...] ('in the well') vs. [...] ('her well'); [...] ('sheriff') vs. [...] ('the sheriff'). Amongst the various views on how to interpret this situation, the most promising one may be that the words displaying these complex tones have an extra mora.

50|$|Mechanical {{stresses}} {{also influence}} the frequency. The stresses can be induced by mounting, bonding, {{and application of}} the electrodes, by differential thermal expansion of the mounting, electrodes, and the crystal itself, by differential thermal stresses {{when there is a}} temperature gradient present, by expansion or shrinkage of the bonding materials during curing, by the air pressure that is transferred to the ambient pressure within the crystal enclosure, by the stresses of the crystal lattice itself (nonuniform growth, impurities, dislocations), by the surface imperfections and damage caused during manufacture, and by the action of gravity on the mass of the crystal; the frequency can therefore be influenced by position of the crystal. Other <b>dynamic</b> <b>stress</b> inducing factors are shocks, vibrations, and acoustic noise. Some cuts are less sensitive to stresses; the SC (Stress Compensated) cut is an example. Atmospheric pressure changes can also introduce deformations to the housing, influencing the frequency by changing stray capacitances.|$|E
