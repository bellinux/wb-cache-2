5|$|During {{the same}} period, the club changed its {{official}} language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan <b>identity.</b> <b>For</b> many fans, {{participating in the}} club had {{less to do with}} the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity. On 4 February 1917, the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ramón Torralba who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa, which Barcelona won 6–2.|$|E

5|$|The {{popularity}} of batik in Indonesia has varied. Historically, {{it was essential}} for ceremonial costumes and it was worn {{as part of a}} kebaya dress, commonly worn every day.

5|$|After {{years of}} feuding, the Western Railroad {{joined with the}} Boston and Worcester Railroad in 1867 to become the Boston and Albany Railroad (B). The Housatonic Railroad was {{acquired}} by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (NYNH) as its Berkshire Division in 1892, with most service thus running from Danbury rather than Bridgeport. In 1900, the New York Central Railroad (NYC) leased the B, though the latter retained its independent <b>identity</b> <b>for</b> decades after. The B operated a rail yard and roundhouse just north of Union Station.|$|E
5|$|Bilis {{made its}} first {{landfall}} in northern Taiwan on July 13, with an intensity of 55kt (100km/h, 65mph). After moving across northern Taiwan, Bilis made its second landfall in Fujian, China early on July 14 at the same intensity, then weakened into a tropical depression over land the next day. Bilis lingered as a tropical depression over southeastern China before degenerating into a remnant low on July 16. But the JMA carried {{the system as a}} tropical depression until July 17. Despite becoming a remnant low, the remnants of Bilis maintained their <b>identity</b> <b>for</b> several days while moving westward over China, bringing heavy rains to inland areas.|$|E

5|$|During {{the later}} 20th century and afterward, {{many of the}} {{communities}} and businesses in the area began cooperative efforts, including the Clear Lake Area Chamber of Commerce, the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership, and the Bay Area Houston Transportation Partnership, to create a distinct economic and civic <b>identity</b> <b>for</b> the region and to plan regional development. Though most of the communities {{in the region have}} been incorporated into municipalities, a few unincorporated communities remain under the extra-territorial jurisdiction of neighboring towns. These include San Leon, Bacliff, and Smith Point. The communities of San Leon and Bacliff, despite their seaside location, their proximity to the relatively prosperous Clear Lake Area, and the development of summer resort communities there in the early 20th century, have suffered economic decline since the mid-20th century and are among the least affluent parts of the Bay Area today.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, Taiwan's {{aboriginal}} inhabitants experienced economic {{competition and}} military conflict {{with a series}} of colonising newcomers. Centralised government policies designed to foster language shift and cultural assimilation, as well as continued contact with the colonisers through trade, intermarriage and other intercultural processes, have resulted in varying degrees of language death and loss of original cultural <b>identity.</b> <b>For</b> example, of the approximately 26 known languages of the Taiwanese aborigines (collectively referred to as the Formosan languages), at least ten are now extinct, five are moribund and several are to some degree endangered. These languages are of unique historical significance, since most historical linguists consider Taiwan to be the original homeland of the Austronesian language family.|$|E
5|$|The China Meteorological Administration {{released}} {{a press release}} after the storm and gave four reasons for the extensive damage. First, the storm decelerated after landfall and maintained its <b>identity</b> <b>for</b> 120hours while moving south of due west. Secondly, the storm was asymmetric and rainfall concentrated in the southern semicircle. Also, the storm interacted with the active monsoon over the South China Sea, and the Hong Kong Observatory reported a 1-hour rainfall total of 115.1mm (4.5inches), a new record. Finally, previous rainfall had made the area wetter than normal and more prone to flooding.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} wind shear finally took their toll late on January 4, and Zeta's {{convection}} began to die down. This led to Tropical Storm Zeta weakening to a minimal tropical storm. The NHC continued to overestimate how quickly Zeta would dissipate and early on January 5 they operationally downgraded Zeta to a depression, which was later confirmed {{to have been}} an error. Zeta continued to move west-northwestward, barely holding on to tropical storm status before becoming disorganized again. Zeta weakened into a tropical depression on January 6 and dissipated into a remnant later that day. With this transition, the very active 2005 hurricane season finally came to a close. The remnant low retained its <b>identity</b> <b>for</b> a further day before it dissipated 660miles (1060km) southeast of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|The riots {{caused a}} major change in the government's {{approach}} to racial issues, and led to the introduction of an aggressive affirmative action policy strongly favouring the Malays, the New Economic Policy (NEP). The National Culture Policy, also introduced in 1970, emphasised an assimilation of the non-Malays into the Malay ethnic group. However, during the 1990s Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad rejected this approach, with his Bangsa Malaysia policy emphasising a Malaysian instead of Malay <b>identity</b> <b>for</b> the state. During the 2000s decade politicians began stressing ketuanan Melayu again, and publicly chastised government ministers who questioned the social contract.|$|E
5|$|Despite his superpowers, Parker {{struggles to}} help his widowed aunt pay rent, is taunted by his peers—particularly {{football}} star Flash Thompson—and, as Spider-Man, engenders the editorial wrath of newspaper publisher J.

In time, Peter graduates from high school, and enrolls at Empire State University (a fictional institution evoking the real-life Columbia University and New York University), where he meets roommate and best friend Harry Osborn, and girlfriend Gwen Stacy, and Aunt May introduces him to Mary Jane Watson. As Peter deals with Harry's drug problems, and Harry's father is revealed to be Spider-Man's nemesis the Green Goblin, Peter even attempts {{to give up his}} costumed <b>identity</b> <b>for</b> a while.

40|$|We define Leibniz triple {{systems in}} a functorial manner using the {{algorithm}} of Kolesnikov and Pozhidaev which converts <b>identities</b> <b>for</b> algebras into <b>identities</b> <b>for</b> dialgebras.

5|$|Marvel has {{featured}} Spider-Man {{in several}} comic book series, {{the first and}} longest-lasting of which is titled The Amazing Spider-Man. Over the years, the Peter Parker character has developed from shy, nerdy New York City high school student to troubled but outgoing college student, to married high school teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer. In the 2010s, he joins the Avengers, Marvel's flagship superhero team.
