40|$|Efficiency of {{ultrafiltration}} separation may {{be greatly}} increased when preliminary selective binding {{components of a}} solution to the form of aggregates (high molecular substances and colloidal particles). One of the possible ways of aggregation is the formation of complexes with water soluble polymers. One can find such a polymer agent which binds only one component. Hence only this component will be rejected during ultrafiltration. The second way is the conversion of a component to the form of hydroxide. This method is acceptable for removal of heavy metal ions. In this case we cannot receive very highselectivity as in the first, but it is possible to get a rejection effect using only pH adjustment.

In the <b>electroplating</b> and <b>water</b> {{treatment}} fields, as {{the demand}} and expectation on an electrode with high productivity and high efficiency are getting increased, various electrodes(DSE) with higher reactivity and durability are being developed. This study {{is intended to}} analyze {{the characteristics of the}} produced electrodes and to establish the optimum manufacturing conditions for electrode being used that we mentioned. For improving the durability, the changes of reactivity and corrosion resistance are observed as adding Tantalum and/or another components (hereafter stated as “α”) and surface treatment of substrate(Ti). As a result, increasing the amount of Iridium, the reactivity of electrode increased, and increasing amount of Tantalum, the durability of electrode increased. And thus, it is found out that Iridium and Tantalum have the opposite role each on the electrode’s reactivity and durability. And adding α and surface treatment substrate, an electrode with excellent reactivity and durability and low oxygen evolution can be manufactured. In the water treatment field like sterilizing in a swimming pool and power-plant cooling water, the high efficiency of sodium-hypochlorite generation is surely guaranteed. 1...|$|R

All of the specified additions differ diametrically in terms of properties, starting from the spatial structure of the particles, up to the chemical properties. Membranes were obtained using phase inversion method from a solution of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Subsequently, the impact of the nano-addition on the transport and separation properties of the membranes were investigated using Millipore AMICON ultrafiltration kit. Membranes with graphene addition (PAN/RG) are characterized by the best transport properties and the highest specific permeate flux values in the range of ~ 913 ÷ 1006 [dm 3 /m 2 ×h] for working pressure of 2. 0 MPa.

It is pointed out that conventional <b>electroplating</b> waste <b>water</b> treatment plants in Russian Federation have several disadvantages, such relatively high operating costs and low wastewater processing efficiency. Thus electroplating wastewater treatment plants have to be modernized according to Best Available Technologies (BAT). A modern electroplating wastewater treatment and recycling technology based on BAT such as electroflotation, ultrafiltration and industrial reverse osmosis has been developed and successfully implemented at several RF industrial enterprises. The represented system is free from the disadvantages such as conventional wastewater processing technologies have. It allows to achieve integrated treatment of electroplating wastewater from heavy metal ions down to 0, 04 mg/l and from oil products down to 0, 05 mg/l within low power and chemicals consumptions with further water reuse, significantly reducing water disposal and WWTPs operating costs and thus ensuring the profitability of WWTPs usage {{and as a result}} electroplating industry in general.

However, in Indonesian small-medium scale electroplating industries, these processes are often ineffective {{since they are}} rather complicated to apply. Therefore, a batch-wise UV/TiO 2 photocatalysis potentially offers a more effective and easy-to-use process. In this study, waste water containing Cr 6 + similar to real industrial effluents was treated by UV/TiO 2 photocatalysis, in which photogenerated electrons could reduce highly toxic Cr 6 + to relatively harmless Cr 3 +. The photoreactor used in this investigation was a 3 -L bubble column photoreactor equipped with a 64 W low pressure UV amalgam lamp (20 W at 254 nm).

The photoreductive treatment was not possible without a hole scavenger (such as EDTA, oxalic acid, citric acid) presence due to the fast recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes. This investigation, in particular, focused on the two main factors affecting the effectiveness of Cr 6 + photoreductive process which were photocatalyst concentration (varied from 0. 5 to 2 g L - 1) and pH (in the range of 1 - 3). Under the experimental conditions, the removal Cr(VI) was between 76. 5 - 94. 2 %.
