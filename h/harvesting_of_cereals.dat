50|$|Four {{soundings}} {{were taken}} in a rescue mission in 1967 by Henri de Contenson who produced the first report in 1968. A single level of occupation was found with compartmentalised buildings made of regular shaped bricks and lime plaster floors with small hearths. Relatively advanced flint sickles and blades were found along with obsidian blades and relatively few arrowheads. Mortars and a base made of basalt were found. Contenson suggested that <b>harvesting</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> {{would have been more}} important than hunting for the inhabitants. Extensive amounts of pottery were recovered from the site including hand finished flat base dishes, deep bowls and jars. Vessels had handles, knobs, decoration and often given a red wash, which according to Contenson indicated a dating of the site similar to the later Neolithic stages of Byblos; he dated the site to the late 5th millennium BC.|$|E

40|$|The Common hamster Cricetus cricetus was an {{agricultural}} pest in {{large parts of}} Europe less than 50 years ago. Currently the species is highly threatened or locally extinct and acknowledged as an important and even iconic species for nature conservation in farmland areas in Western Europe. The species was listed in the European habitats directive in 1992 to prevent a further decline, but the Common hamster is still declining {{in most parts of}} its European range despite large conservation efforts. Only a few local conservation successes have been reported so far. These disappointing conservation results raise the question: why is it so difficult to conserve this former pest species? Farming practices have been intensified in Europe and this has resulted in a more efficient way <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> <b>cereals</b> in combination with a strong reduction <b>of</b> spring sown <b>cereals</b> in favour <b>of</b> winter sown <b>cereals.</b> It is possible that these changes have become an important threat for survival of populations of this species.

O número de perfilhos alcançou valores maiores do que os da braquiária solteira, após a colheita dos cereais. Os índices de área foliar da braquiária consorciada foram baixos, em comparação com os dos cereais, e a baixa competição, em cobertura foliar, favoreceu a boa produtividade de grãos das culturas.

40|$|We {{intended}} {{to establish the}} potential for interaction between the wheat dwarf virus (WDV) vector leafhopper Psammotettix alienus - a dominant sap feeding pest in cereal fields, and the spider Tibellus oblongus - a dominant predator of grassy field margins. The relationship is important, because with the senescing and <b>harvest</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> P. alienus migrates to alternative host species, grasses. We analyzed the potential of T. oblongus {{to be an effective}} natural enemy of P. alienus by studying the probability of their co-occurrence seasonally and at the habitat and microhabitat scale. By gathering data from long term research (1994 - 2011) in six agricultural regions of Hungary, we assembled 96 one-year-long datasets obtained by suction sampling from the four key habitats of the agricultural landscape mosaic. The analysis showed that both in space and time the spider has the potential to prey on P. alienus. T. oblongus populations can reach considerable densities and represent high dominance among other spiders in the habitats of the leafhopper. Given this co-occurrence pattern, we devised laboratory experiments to study whether P. alienus is included among the preferred prey types of T. oblongus and to ascertain whether prolonged feeding has no adverse effects and provides the nutrients for growth. P. alienus proved to be both a preferred prey type and one that can be utilized for growth by the spider. This study collected the circumstantial ecological and direct laboratory feeding trial proofs that T. oblongus can be an important biological control agent against the leafhopper pest P. alienus. © 2013 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

40|$|This {{work was}} a part of a larger project, which tries to {{estimate}} the risk of soil compaction in the subsoil when using heavy sugar beet harvesters, in relation to soil type and water content in the field at harvest time. The {{purpose of this study was}} to follow the changes in soil water con tent during the growing period, in a spring sown crop and in sugar beets. Two sites with different soil types were used during the period of growth 1997. The method used was to take soil samples for gravimetric water content every two weeks in 10 cm layers to 1 m depth. Saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention was determined on soil cores in each 10 cm layer to l m depth. Meteorological data was collected from nearby weather stations. The calculated evaporation from the crop was compared with the potential. The water content in the subsoil changed more slowly than in the topsoil. The cereal crop absorbed more water than the sugar beets until the middle of the summer, but during late summer and autumn the water content in the soil was lower in the sugar beets than in the cereal crop. At both sites the profile was practically emptied on plant accessible water down to l meter during the summer. At one of the sites the calculated transpiration from 6 July to 8 August was approximately half of the potential, which indicates that the crops suffered from drought. At <b>harvest</b> time <b>of</b> the <b>cereal</b> crop the soil had low water con tent. The water content in the sugar beet field was larger at the time <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> <b>of</b> the sugar beets. At <b>harvest</b> time <b>of</b> the <b>cereal</b> crop there was little risk of subsoil compaction because of the low soil water content. At the time <b>of</b> sugar beet <b>harvest</b> there was probably a risk of subsoil compaction. A possibility to avoid compaction would be to harvest the sugar beets before an expected large rainfall, although some losses of sugar may occur during the storage of the sugar beets...|$|R
