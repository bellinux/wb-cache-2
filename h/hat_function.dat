The QRS {{signal to noise ratio}} enhancement and the detection accuracy of each wavelet function are evaluated using three measures: (1) the ratio of the maximum beat amplitude to the minimum beat amplitude (RMM), (2) the mean of absolute of time error (MATE), and (3) the figure of merit (FOM). Three wavelet functions from previous well-known publications are explored, i. e., Bior 1. 3, Db 10, and Mexican <b>hat</b> wavelet <b>functions.</b> Results evaluated with the ECG signal from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database show that the Mexican <b>hat</b> wavelet <b>function</b> is better than the others.
