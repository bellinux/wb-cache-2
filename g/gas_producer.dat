25|$|Romanian {{shale gas}} {{reserves}} could consolidate the country's {{role as the}} largest <b>gas</b> <b>producer</b> in Central Europe. In May 2012, the government temporarily suspended permits for shale gas exploration {{while waiting for the}} results of the EU's environmental studies on this energy source. In March 2013, Prime Minister Victor Ponta announced that the moratorium on shale gas exploration in Romania had been lifted. This decision could help boost domestic energy resources and reduce Romania's dependency on Russian gas. This decision sparked large nationwide protests aimed at banning the exploitation of shale gas and to remove the current government of Romania.|$|E
25|$|According to IEA Indonesia was the 10th top natural <b>gas</b> <b>producer</b> in 2009: 76 billion cubics (bcm) 2.5% {{of world}} {{production}} of which 36 bcm was exported. In 2009 Indonesia was the 5th top coal producer: 263 million tonnes hard coal and 38 million tonnes brown. The majority of this, 230 Mt of hard coal, was exported. Indonesia has significant energy resources, starting with oil – it has 22 {{billion barrels of}} conventional oil and gas reserves, of which about 4 billion are recoverable. That's the equivalent of about10 years of oil production and 50 years of gas. It has about 8 billion barrels of oil-equivalent of coal-based methane (CBM) resources. It has 28 billion tonnes of recoverable coal. It has 28 gigawatts (GW) of geothermal potential.|$|E
25|$|The {{main issue}} {{in dealing with}} the fossil fuel {{phase-out}} has been job loss. Companies in the fossil fuel industry have begun to experience the effects of the phasing-out of fossil fuels like coal. For example, Consol Energy, originally a coal-producing company, has begun the transition to becoming a natural <b>gas</b> <b>producer.</b> Not only does this shift affect its current role in the coal industry but it also has led to employment cuts. With the shuttering of coal plants, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association estimates that over one million jobs will be lost. With the coal industry aging, many coal mines are deteriorating and becoming costly to keep running. As a result, coal plants are no longer a reliable, go-to energy source for the United States.|$|E
