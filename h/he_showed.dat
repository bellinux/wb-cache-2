5|$|<b>He</b> <b>showed</b> that {{coloured}} light {{does not change}} its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour {{is the result of}} objects interacting with already-{{coloured light}} rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour.|$|E
