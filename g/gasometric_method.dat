A direct inspection was performed of vital signs on the calves and the ABB indicators were determined using a <b>gasometric</b> <b>method.</b> Data were processed by means of descriptive statistics and the Duncan {{test was used to}} differentiate between the averages. The degree of association was established between the ABB indicators in cows and calves by using the Pearson correlation and a comparison of proportions was performed on the indexes of the newborns. Results. Regarding the cows, the ABB indicators were found within the reference values; however, in the calves the pH, pCO 2, HCO 3 -, the anion gap (AG) and the bases excess (BE) varied. A correlation was found between AG, BE and metabolic hydrogen ions (M*H). The AG in cows and calves showed notable differences (p< 0. 05) among the farms in the study. According to the numeric classification system, the suction reflect indicated a greater percentage of calves in group one. Conclusions. The ABB analyte measurement in cows was similar to the consulted reference; however, in calves some analytes did not coincide. This suggests metabolic acidosis in newborn calves due to the increase of AG and the decrease of BE.

The major dif-ficulty has been that the more accurate techniques (1 - 4) are also the most difficult and time consuming, whereas the simpler and more rapid methods (5, 6) are not as sensitive. A recent report of a National Academy of Sciences Committee (7) emphasizes not only the general inadequacies of the existing meth-odology for carbon monoxide (CO) analysis in blood but also the need for development of an adequate technique for assessing the influence of low concen-trations of carboxyhemoglobin on human perfor-mance. Gas chromatography has proved to be a very accu-rate method for measuring blood gases, and several such techniques have been developed for CO (3, 8, 9).

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{quick and}} {{accurate}} method {{of determining the}} concentration of carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) in blood has been developed. The method uses a dual wavelength double beam spectro-photometer in the 1 st derivative mode, linked to a digital voltmeter (DVM), with the two beams set 3 nm apart around an isobestic point of reduced haemoglobin (Hbred) and carboxyhaemoglobin at 579 nm. The 1 st derivative mode measures the slope, and this slope {{is proportional to the}} concentra-tion of COHb. Techniques currently used to measure COHb levels in blood include <b>gasometric</b> <b>methods,</b> colori-metry, gas chromatography, precipitation tech-niques, infrared analysis and spectrophotometric methods. Not one of these methods (described in the papers listed in the Reference section) is both rapid and accurate. In an effort to combine accuracy and rapidity, attention has been concentrated on spectrophotometric methods. Theory The absorbance spectra of reduced haemoglobin (Hbred) and COHb (Figure 1) between 600 and 500 nm have similar curves with three isobestic points. At the isobestic point around 579 nm the absorbance slope alters with concentration (Figure 2). Closer examination of absorbance curves (Figure 3) between 585 and 575 nm shows that the curves of Hbred and COHb are straight lines but have different-slopes. If the slope can be measured, then the con-centration of COHb can be calculated: this is the basis of the method described here.

40|$|Haemodynamic and {{respiratory}} {{data were obtained}} by <b>gasometric</b> <b>methods</b> in two groups of patients with hepatic cirrhosis, who were distinguishable by {{the presence or absence}} of finger clubbing. Cardiac index and venoarterial admixture were significantly higher in cases with clubbing; these findings are discussed. However, levels of venoarterial admixture were normal in four with clubbing, which suggests that increased right-to-left shuntflow is not an essentialfactor in the pathogenesis of clubbing in liver disease. Finger clubbing is most often seen in diseases of the lungs or heart, but it is also a common finding in hepatic cirrhosis. The pathogenesis of clubbing is not fully understood, but various studies (Mendlowitz, I 938; Charr and Swenson, I 946; Lovell, I 950; Wilson, I 952) have shown that it may be a consequence of digital vasodilatation. Furthermore, Hall (1959) suggested that venoarterial admixture might be responsible for clubbing in certain cardiopulmonary diseases; he proposed that a vasodilator substance normally detoxicated in the pulmonary capillary bed could thereby enter the systemic circulation and cause the associated digital vascular changes. Since venoarterial admixture in cirrhosis may result from both intrapulmonary arterio-venous (Rydell and Hoffbauer, 1956) or porta-pulinonary anastomoses (Calabresi and Abelmann, 1957), and peripheral vaso-dilatation may be widespread giving an increased cardiac output (Kowalski and Abelmann, I 953), it has seemed possible that this lung bypass mechanism might account for clubbing in liver disease (Stein and Stein, I 961; Bashour, McConnell, and Miller, I 967).
