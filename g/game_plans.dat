5000|$|Loch Ness Monster, {{built in}} 1985, {{was the final}} pinball machine built by <b>Game</b> <b>Plan,</b> before the <b>Game</b> <b>Plan</b> company went out of business.

Among the few who have played it, Loch Ness Monster {{is said to be}} Game Plan's best game, by far.

25|$|The Hall of Fame Game {{was played}} in Canton, Ohio on Sunday August 5, 2007, with the Pittsburgh Steelers {{defeating}} the Saints by {{a score of}} 20–7; the game was televised by the NFL Network, replacing NBC, who had been previously scheduled to broadcast the China Bowl exhibition game from Beijing, China on August 8, 2007 between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks at Workers Stadium.

25|$|Robinson {{was fired}} {{at the end of}} the 1991 season. The return of Chuck Knox as head coach, after Knox's {{successful}} stints as head coach of the Buffalo Bills and Seattle Seahawks, would not boost the Rams' fortunes. His run-oriented offense marked the end of the Zampese tenure in 1993. Knox' <b>game</b> <b>plans</b> called for an offense that would be steady, if unspectacular. Unfortunately for the Rams, Knox's offense was not only aesthetically unpleasing but dull as well, especially by 1990s standards. The Rams finished last in the NFC West during all three years of Knox' second stint, and were never a serious contender during this time.|$|E
25|$|To help Tyler Thigpen {{prepare for}} the game against the Jets, the Chiefs {{implemented}} the spread offense to help Thigpen {{and the rest of}} the younger players play to the best of their abilities, and also following the absence of RB Larry Johnson due to suspension. The Chiefs made a huge gamble by doing so, as most in the NFL believe that a spread offense cannot work in professional football, and also head coach Herman Edwards was traditionally in favor of more conservative, run-oriented <b>game</b> <b>plans.</b> Prior to the Chiefs implementing the spread offense, Thigpen had been playing erratically with the Chiefs, and he suddenly became poised and effective running the new offense.|$|E

25|$|Zheng's game is characterised by consistency, intellect, quick {{reflexes}} {{and fighting}} spirit. She {{is not the}} strongest player, but makes up for this with her careful thinking of where to place her shots and willingness to change <b>game</b> <b>plans</b> if a strategy is not working. Her shots are {{of a lot of}} pace and very well placed, making Zheng an excellent defensive counterpuncher. She has one of the best footwork and court coverage on the tour, which allows her to keep shots in play that would normally be winners; so few shots get by her that after the final match of 2005 Hobart International, the finalist Gisela Dulko described her game as 'The Great Wall of China' because 'she didn't miss one ball'. Also an accomplished doubles player, she is very comfortable when playing at the net. Zheng's best shot is her backhand. Zheng's main weakness is her serve; however she is sometimes able to neutralize her weak serve with her quickness or by serving to the body or to the opponent's weaker groundstroke.|$|E

Roma began to control the midfield with the Brazilian duo Falcão and Toninho Cerezo combining to combat Souness in the Liverpool midfield. Roma's best chance of this period was a [...] shot from Falcão which Grobbelaar saved. Roma began to lose control of the period, with both sides abandoning their initial <b>game</b> <b>plans</b> for fearing of conceding a goal. Liverpool substituted striker Johnston with defender Steve Nicol in the 72nd minute. The best chance of the half came in the 85th minute; Kenny Dalglish found Nicol in the Roma penalty area, but his shot was saved by Tancredi. The scores stayed level throughout the remainder of the half, which meant that the match would go into extra-time.|$|E
