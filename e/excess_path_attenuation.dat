40|$|We studied seismic waves {{attenuation}} in Kinki region, Japan, in {{high frequency}} range 1 - 10 Hz. To do this {{it was assumed}} that observed amplitude Fourier spectrum is a product of source, elastic <b>path</b> <b>attenuation,</b> inelastic <b>path</b> <b>attenuation</b> and site effects. Inelastic <b>path</b> <b>attenuation</b> is described by the Q-value. Frequently, to estimate <b>path</b> <b>attenuation</b> effect, Q-value is inverted under simplified assumption that geometrical spreading is spherical. Actually, elastic attenuation is complex effect that includes geometrical spreading in non-uniform velocity model, reflection and conversion on major velocity discontinuities, free-surface effect. In this study, elastic <b>path</b> <b>attenuation</b> was calculated using the ray-theory approach in 3 -D velocity model. Source and Site effects were eliminated using the double-spectral ratio scheme. Travel times inside blocks were calculated by the 3 -D ray tracing. After this, Q-values in blocked media were inverted using a tomography approach. For this study, we developed 3 -D velocity model for Kinki area. This model includes: low-velocity layer (LV), upper crust (UC), lower crust (LC), subducted Philippine Sea plate (SP) and mantle wedge (MW). The whole media of the wave propagation were divided into blocks with constant Q-value according to the tectonic structure. For inversion we used borehole data of the Hi-net and Denkyoken networks and hard rock/stiff soil data of CEORKA network. Analysis of the results of inversion shows that largest Q~ 150 f 0. 8 was in UC block, smallest Q= 70 f 0. 57 was in LC+MW block; for SP Q= 175 f 0. 3. In UC, Q-value is larger in central Kinki region: Q= 220 f 0. 86, than in the south: Q= 120 f 0. 55 or in northern part of Kinki region: Q= 125 f 0. 68.

40|$|Dual-polarized weather radars {{are capable}} {{to detect and}} {{identify}} different classes of hydrometeors, within stratiform and convective storms, exploiting polarimetric diversity. Among the various techniques, a model-supervised Bayesian method for hydrometeor classification, tuned for S- and X-band polarimetric weather radars, can be effectively applied. Once the hydrometeor class is estimated, the retrieval of their water content can also be statistically carried out. However, the critical issue of X-band radar data processing, and in general of any attenuating wavelength active system, is the intervening <b>path</b> <b>attenuation,</b> which is usually not negligible. Any approach aimed at estimating hydrometeor water content {{should be able to}} tackle, at the same time, <b>path</b> <b>attenuation</b> correction, hydrometeor classification uncertainty, and retrieval errors.
