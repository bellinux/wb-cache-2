5|$|Both the PC and WiiWare {{versions}} of the game received positive reviews, with many critics applauding the gameplay mechanics and the visuals. And Yet <b>It</b> <b>Moves</b> was also released {{as part of the}} third Humble Indie Bundle.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>moved</b> to 750 kHz then 1200 kHz, both in 1927. <b>It</b> <b>moved</b> to 880 kHz in 1928. As {{a result}} of the NARBA {{agreement}} <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> to 910 kHz in 1941. <b>It</b> <b>moved</b> to its current frequency in 1948.|$|R
50|$|The {{paper was}} first {{printed on the}} second story of a three-story {{building}} at 407-409 Delaware. In 1881 <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> 14 W. 5th Street. In 1882 <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> to 115 W. 6th. In 1889 <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> to 804-806 Wyandotte. In 1911 <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> into its Jarvis Hunt-designed building at 18th and Grand.|$|R
50|$|KAGO {{signed on}} in 1923 on 1220 kHz as KFJI. In 1927 <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> to 1200 kHz.

5|$|Broken Rules {{currently}} {{has no plans}} to develop a sequel to And Yet <b>It</b> <b>Moves,</b> due to the time spent on the game. Bohatsch commented that he is unopposed to the idea and is amenable to proposals to develop such a game.|$|E
5|$|During this process, fungal spores {{germinate}} in the boreholes, {{a reaction}} {{caused by the}} dryness of the tree, creating an appropriate environment and an entry for air. The fungus breaks down the lignin, causing white rot. <b>It</b> <b>moves</b> towards the vertically aligned xylem. The vertical profile shows reddish and white streaks which run {{in the direction of}} growth.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many species}} of spider, a P. schultzi lays a {{continuous}} dragline of silk as <b>it</b> <b>moves,</b> {{and from time to}} time anchors the dragline to a surface with a spot of sticky silk. This allows the spider to return to the surface if the animal is dislodged. A spider about to jump first lays a sticky silk anchor, and then lays out a dragline as it flies. Unlike those of most jumping spiders, P. schultzi′s draglines stick to each other and, when a P. schultzi has laid a few lines across a gap, it uses these as walkways and reinforces them with additional silk as <b>it</b> <b>moves.</b>|$|E
50|$|In February 1918, <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> {{to support}} 17. Armee at Aniche. On 27 September, <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> to the Armee-Abteilung A Sector; shortly thereafter, on 8 October, <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> on {{to work for}} 2. Armee until war's end.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> later <b>moved</b> to RAF Swanton Morley but shortly {{afterwards}} <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> back to Cambridge <b>it</b> then <b>moved</b> to RAF Wyton and in 2014 <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> to {{its present}} home at RAF Wittering operating the Grob Tutor T.1.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, <b>it</b> later <b>moved</b> to Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation. After a year, <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> back to KBS before <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> {{again to}} Government Television a year later.|$|R
5|$|October 1, 1963 - Hurricane Flora strikes Tobago {{and remains}} just {{offshore}} of Venezuela as <b>it</b> <b>moves</b> through the Caribbean Sea as a Category3 hurricane. Damage in Venezuela, if any, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Selenium is {{commonly}} {{described as a}} metalloid in the environmental chemistry literature. <b>It</b> <b>moves</b> through the aquatic environment similarly to arsenic and antimony; its water-soluble salts, in higher concentrations, have a similar toxicological profile to that of arsenic.|$|E
5|$|Ten of GO's train {{stations}} are shared with Via Rail. GO also connects with fifteen other municipal transit providers, {{such as the}} TTC. Metrolinx calls many of these transfer points between services mobility hubs, and it has made them a priority as <b>it</b> <b>moves</b> forward with The Big Move regional transportation plan.|$|E
60|$|A rustle, and <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> clumsily, {{with a sort}} of hopping. And as <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> <b>it</b> gave a low groan.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>moved</b> bases {{several times}} {{throughout}} the war. Between June 1941 and September 1941 <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> to Drontheim. Then it was shifted to Memel and subsequently to Libau. At {{the end of}} 1944 it was shifted again to Gotenhafen and then finally in 1945 <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> to Travemünde.|$|R

5|$|The Clouds divide, and JUNO {{appears in}} a Machine drawn by Peacocks; while a Symphony is playing, <b>it</b> <b>moves</b> gently forward, and as it descends, it opens and discovers the Tail of the Peacock, which is so large, that it almost fills {{the opening of the}} Stage between Scene and Scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} voalavo probably largely {{lives on}} the ground, but is able to climb in vegetation. It likes areas with dense networks of roots, among which <b>it</b> <b>moves</b> using runways and natural tunnels. The species is nocturnal (active during the night), is solitary, probably eats fruits and seeds, and bears up to three young per litter.|$|E
5|$|And Yet <b>It</b> <b>Moves</b> {{focuses on}} moving the player {{character}} {{through a series}} of hazardous environments. The player possesses the ability to freely rotate the entire game world, transforming walls into floors and vice versa. The game's levels and puzzles are designed around this concept. The game features paper collage styled visuals designed by Jan Hackl and a beatboxing soundtrack performed by Christoph Binder.|$|E
5000|$|KVEC was {{originally}} on 1200 kHz. Under the NARBA treaty <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> to 1230 kHz in March, 1941. <b>It</b> <b>moved</b> to 920 kHz in 1946.|$|R

The PC version gained aggregate {{scores of}} 71.50% and 75 on GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively, while the WiiWare version gained aggregate scores of 85.30% and 83. Critics applauded the game's unique {{take on the}} platforming genre and the game's paper collage visual style, but felt the game was too short. Some critics noted {{the absence of any}} narrative or backstory, but felt that the game ultimately didn't need one, though GameSpot noted it as one of the game's weaknesses.|$|E
5|$|It mostly breeds in acacia and {{tamarisk}} scrub {{and tall}} grass, invariably near rivers or other wetlands. The construction {{and expansion of}} irrigation canals has increased its habitat in Sindh, and helped it extend its range into the Yamuna floodplain and parts of Rajasthan, India. It may breed around rice paddies and other fields, or human habitations, provided that there is enough cover and suitable nesting sites. In winter, <b>it</b> <b>moves</b> away from its main riverine habitat, and into drier thickets characterised by Salvadora and Capparis bushes, but never moves too far from water.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bacteria}} (such as E. coli) {{have two}} distinct modes of movement: forward movement (swimming) and tumbling. The tumbling {{allows them to}} reorient and makes their movement a three-dimensional random walk. (See external links below for link to videos.) The flagella of a unique group of bacteria, the spirochaetes, are found between two membranes in the periplasmic space. They have a distinctive helical body that twists about as <b>it</b> <b>moves.</b>|$|E
50|$|Up {{until the}} end of November 2007, Inkscape's bug {{tracking}} system was hosted on SourceForge. Thereafter <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> to Launchpad. In June 2017 <b>it</b> <b>moved</b> to GitLab.|$|R

5|$|Milan Records {{released}} a Chef soundtrack on May 6, 2014, {{three days before}} the film's release. The soundtrack is a combination of Latin jazz, New Orleans jazz and blues, which serve as background to the storyline as <b>it</b> <b>moves</b> through Miami, New Orleans and Austin, respectively. The film's music was chosen by music supervisor Mathieu Schreyer, while the incidental music was scored by Lyle Workman.|$|E
5|$|September 25, 1998 - Hurricane Georges {{passes over}} Key West as a Category2 {{hurricane}}, and days later <b>it</b> <b>moves</b> eastward through the Florida Panhandle after hitting Biloxi, Mississippi. In the Florida Keys, the hurricane produced 8.41inches (214mm) {{of rain in}} Tavernier and wind gusts peaking at 110mph (177km/h) in Marathon. There, Georges damages 1,363homes and destroys 173houses, with damage amounting to $270million (1998USD) in the Keys. In the Florida Panhandle, the storm drops 38.46inches (977mm) of rain in Munson and results in $70million in damage (1998USD, $93million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|The minuet is in F major, {{but it is}} {{not until}} well into its second half that a strong chord in the tonic arrives. Once again among the Opus 50 minuets, Haydn is unsettling {{harmonic}} conventions. Haydn also toys with metre {{towards the end of the}} minuet: <b>it</b> <b>moves</b> into, and concludes, essentially in duple time. The trio follows, and its theme almost identical to that of the minuet, albeit in a minor key and played by all four parts in unison.|$|E
