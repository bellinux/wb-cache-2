5|$|A {{few weeks}} {{following}} this, the bad blood {{between the two}} sides intensified, {{so much so that the}} new management of TNA (now renamed Impact Wrestling) Anthem Sports & Entertainment issued a cease and desist letter to The Hardys' new promotion Ring of Honor (ROH), in which Anthem essentially ordered ROH as well as any broadcasting company airing ROH's 15th Anniversary pay–per–view show (on which The Hardys were to participate in a match) to not in any way speak of, indicate or acknowledge the existence of the Broken Matt and Brother Nero characters and instead to refer to The Hardys as simply Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy. The issue with this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>The</b> Hardys were in TNA, they had full creative control over the Broken gimmick, with them even filming their own segments to air on TNA programming in some circumstances, thus making the Hardy family (in their belief) the owners of the Broken gimmick. It is believed that civil litigation will follow and a potential court hearing will take place regarding the final outcome on who owns the Broken gimmick: Anthem or the Hardy family. Until then, the status of the Broken gimmick remains undecided. Despite this, Matt continues to use the Broken gimmick through his social media accounts, but neither him or Jeff use the Broken gimmick at any professional wrestling shows for ROH or on the independent circuit, presumably until the results of the expected legal proceedings have been finalized.|$|E
5|$|In the east, however, Manuel's {{achievements}} {{are more}} ambiguous. He suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Myriokephalon in 1176 against the Turks. Manuel was marching against Konya, the Turkish capital, when his forces were ambushed; the ensuing defeat has since entered {{the popular imagination}} as a legendary disaster. Exaggerated accounts of the battle often describe {{the destruction of the}} entire Byzantine army, and with it the end of Byzantine power and influence. However, the modern consensus among Byzantine historians <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Myriokephalon was a serious humiliation for the emperor, it was certainly not a catastrophe. Nor was it in any way equivalent to the Battle of Manzikert over a century earlier. In fact, much of the emperor's army emerged from the battle without serious damage. Units involved in the battle are well documented as campaigning in Asia Minor the following year. The imperial frontier remained unmoved for the remainder of Manuel's reign, a clear indication that the Turks were unable to gain any advantage from their victory. In 1177, the Byzantines inflicted a major defeat on a large Turkish force at Hyelion and Leimocheir in the Meander valley.|$|E

25|$|One {{aspect of}} the American system of {{government}} <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of the world}} now views the United States as one country, domestically American constitutional law recognizes a federation of state governments separate from (and not subdivisions of) the federal government, each of which is sovereign over its own affairs.

25|$|During the Nazi German {{occupation}} {{many citizens}} of German descent in Poland {{registered with the}} Deutsche Volksliste.

Pope John Paul II was particularly attached to Fátima and credited Our Lady of Fátima with saving his life after he was shot in Rome on the Feast Day of Our Lady of Fátima in May 1981.

25|$|The historiography of the {{revolution}} is especially significant due to Abbasid dominance of most early Muslim historical narratives; it was during their rule that history {{was established in the}} Muslim world as an independent field separate from writing in general. The initial two-hundred year period when the Abbasids actually held de facto power over the Muslim world coincided with the first composition of Muslim history. Another point of note <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>the</b> Abbasid Revolution carried religious undertones against the irreligious and almost secular Umayyads, a separation of mosque and state occurred under the Abbasids as well. Historiographical surveys often focus on the solidifying of Muslim thought and rites under the Abbasids, with the conflicts between separated classes of rulers and clerics giving rise to the empire's eventual separation of religion and politics.|$|E
500|$|A paradox in {{metabolism}} <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>the</b> {{vast majority}} of complex life on Earth requires oxygen for its existence, oxygen is a highly reactive molecule that damages living organisms by producing reactive oxygen species. Consequently, organisms contain a complex network of antioxidant metabolites and enzymes that work together to prevent oxidative damage to cellular components such as DNA, proteins and lipids. In general, antioxidant systems either prevent these reactive species from being formed, or remove them before they can damage vital components of the cell. However, reactive oxygen species also have useful cellular functions, such as redox signaling. [...] Thus, the function of antioxidant systems is not to remove oxidants entirely, but instead to keep them at an optimum level.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1960s Tippett {{worked on a}} series of {{compositions}} that reflected the influence of his American experiences after 1965: The Shires Suite (1970), The Knot Garden (1970) and the Symphony No. 3 (1972). [...] In The Knot Garden Mellers discerns Tippett's [...] "wonderfully acute" [...] ear only intermittently, otherwise: [...] "thirty years on, the piece still sounds and looks knotty indeed, exhausting alike to participants and audience". The Third Symphony is overtly linked by Tippett to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony through a vocal finale of four blues songs, introduced by a direct quotation from Beethoven's finale. Tippett's intention, explained by the music critic Calum MacDonald, was to explore the contemporary relevance of the grand, universal sentiments in Schiller's Ode to Joy, as set by Beethoven. [...] Tippett's conclusion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>the</b> need to rejoice remains, the twentieth century has put paid to the Romantic ideals of universality and certainty.|$|E

500|$|Philip Lutgendorf, {{a scholar}} at the University of Iowa, has stated that while {{the theme of the}} {{conflict}} between passionate individual love and family duty may be very common in Hindi film making, with endless cinematic permutations, K.

The song [...] "Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya" [...] sung by Anarkali was an indication of her defiance of societal norms. A major difference from the original story <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>the</b> earlier Anarakali films based on Imtiaz Ali Taj's story ended as tragedies, K. Asif created a relatively happy ending in that Akbar gives amnesty to Anarkali by allowing her to escape through a secret route of tunnels below a false bottom of her prison wall, although his son is made to suffer in believing her to have perished.|$|E
500|$|The plan of {{the rooms}} at Belton was passé for a grand house of its time. Following the Restoration and the influx of European ideas, it had become popular for large houses to follow the {{continental}} fashion of a suite of state rooms consisting of a withdrawing room, dressing room, and bedroom proceeding from {{either side of a}} central saloon or hall. These rooms were permanently reserved for use by a high ranking guest, such as a visiting monarch. While Belton does have a saloon at its centre, enfilades of state rooms of lessening grandeur do not flank it. The possible reason for this unusual layout <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>the</b> Brownlows possessed great wealth, their title was only a baronetcy, and their fortune was barely a century old. They would have been regarded as gentry, not aristocracy. As a result, building a suite of state rooms would have been in hope rather than anticipation of a royal guest. However, the lack of a fashionable and formal suite of state apartments coupled with the Brownlows' lack of social credentials did not prevent a visit from King William III to the newly completed house in 1695. The King occupied the [...] "Best bedchamber", a large room with an adjoining closet, directly above the saloon, that led directly from the second floor Great Dining Chamber.|$|E

50|$|The Fourth Symphony {{is where}} Tchaikovsky's struggles with Western sonata form {{came to a}} head. In some ways he was not alone. The Romantics in general were never natural symphonists because music was to them {{primarily}} evocative and biographical. Western musical form, as developed primarily by Germanic composers, was analytical and architectural; it simply was not designed to handle the personal emotions the Romantics wished to express. The difference with Tchaikovsky <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>the</b> other Romantics remained generally autobiographical in {{what they wanted to}} express, he became more specific and, consequently, more intense.|$|R
500|$|In September 1954, Carl-Gustav Rossby {{assembled}} {{an international}} group of meteorologists in Stockholm and produced the first operational forecast (i.e. routine predictions for practical use) {{based on the}} barotropic equation. Operational numerical weather prediction in the United States began in 1955 under the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit (JNWPU), a joint project by the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Weather Bureau. [...] The JNWPU model was originally a three-layer barotropic model, also developed by Charney. [...] It only modeled {{the atmosphere in the}} Northern Hemisphere. [...] In 1956, the JNWPU switched to a two-layer thermotropic model developed by Thompson and Gates. The main assumption made by the thermotropic model <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>the</b> magnitude of the thermal wind may change, its direction does not change with respect to height, and thus the baroclinicity in the atmosphere can be simulated using the [...] and [...] geopotential height surfaces and the average thermal wind between them. [...] However, due to the low skill showed by the thermotropic model, the JNWPU reverted to the single-layer barotropic model in 1958. [...] The Japanese Meteorological Agency became the third organization to initiate operational numerical weather prediction in 1959. [...] The first real-time forecasts made by Australia's Bureau of Meteorology in 1969 for portions of the Southern Hemisphere were also based on the single-layer barotropic model.|$|E
500|$|Fodor {{responds}} {{to this problem}} with what he defines as [...] "a slightly less crude causal theory". According to this approach, {{it is necessary to}} break the symmetry {{at the base of the}} crude causal theory. Fodor must find some criterion for distinguishing the occurrences of A caused by As (true) from those caused by Bs (false). The point of departure, according to Fodor, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>the</b> false cases are ontologically dependent on the true cases, the reverse is not true. There is an asymmetry of dependence, in other words, between the true contents (A= A) and the false ones (A = A or B). The first can subsist independently of the second, but the second can occur only because of the existence of the first:From the point of view of semantics, errors must be accidents: if in the extension of [...] "horse" [...] there are no cows, then it cannot be required for the meaning of [...] "horse" [...] that cows be called horses. On the other hand, if [...] "horse" [...] did not mean that which it means, and if it were an error for horses, it would never be possible for a cow to be called [...] "horse". Putting the two things together, it can be seen that the possibility of falsely saying [...] "this is a horse" [...] presupposes the existence of a semantic basis for saying it truly, but not vice versa. If we put this in terms of the crude causal theory, the fact that cows cause one to say [...] "horse" [...] depends on the fact that horses cause one to say [...] "horse"; but the fact that horses cause one to say [...] "horse" [...] does not depend on the fact that cows cause one to say [...] "horse"...|$|E
