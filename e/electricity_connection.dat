According to a press release issued by the European Commission the amount earmarked for the Hadera Israel-Vasilikos Cyprus connection is approximately €1.325m. The project is based on an undersea cable for the connection of the electricity systems of Israel, Cyprus and Greece. Its capacity will be 2000 MW and its length approximately 1518km. It will include three connections: 329km between Israel and Cyprus, 879km between Cyprus and Crete and 310km between Crete and mainland Greece and will allow electricity transmission to both directions.|$|E
25|$|During {{the year}} 2013-14, The plant load factor (PLF) of {{coal-fired}} thermal power stations is only 65.43% whereas these stations can run above 85% PLF comfortably provided there is adequate electricity {{demand in the}} country. The additional electricity generation at 85% PLF is nearly 240 billion units which is adequate to replace all the LPG and Kerosene consumption in domestic sector. The incremental cost of generating additional electricity is only their coal fuel cost which is less than 3 Rs/kWh. Enhancing the PLF of coal-fired stations and encouraging domestic electricity consumers to substitute electricity in place of LPG and Kerosene in household cooking, would reduce the government subsidies and idle capacity of thermal power stations can be put to use economically. The domestic consumers {{who are willing to}} surrender the subsidised LPG / Kerosene permits or eligible for subsidised LPG / Kerosene permits, may be given free <b>electricity</b> <b>connection</b> and subsidised electricity tariff.|$|E

40|$|Several Western Balkan states {{face the}} {{consequences}} of the Yugoslavian war, which left hometowns with dilapidated <b>electricity</b> grid <b>connections,</b> a high average age of power plant capacities and low integration of renewable energy sources, grid bottlenecks and a lack of competition. In order to supply all households with electricity, UNDP Croatia did a research on decentralized supply systems based on renewable energy sources. Decentralized supply systems offer cheaper <b>electricity</b> <b>connections</b> and provide faster support to rural development. This paper proposes a developed methodology to financially compare isolated grid solutions that primarily use renewable energies to an extension of the public electricity network to small regions in Croatia. Isolated grid supply proves to be very often a preferable option. Furthermore, it points out the lack of a reliable evaluation of non-monetizable aspects and promotes a new interdisciplinary approach...|$|R

Vattenfall Eldistribution AB has a vision to transform their electricity network into Smart Grids. To invest in Smart Grids they have a need to show their customers what advantages they will get from the development. This led to the formulation of this dissertation project where {{the aim is to}} identify products and services related to Smart Grids that will increase the customer satisfaction for Vattenfall Eldistributions private customers. The project started with a mapping of existing products and services on the Swedish electricity market. From the mapping several development possibilities for Vattenfall Eldistribution were identified. Two of these development possibilities where analyzed more deeply as they seemed to have a grate possibility to fulfil the aim of the project. The two services that where studied more closely were follow-up on new <b>electricity</b> <b>connections</b> and an <b>electricity</b> usage report. The two services where analyzed from a market, organisation and strategy perspective.

40|$|The {{data from}} the project "Conviver," {{launched}} in 2006 in Belo Horizonte (Brazil), provides {{a unique opportunity to}} study illegal <b>electricity</b> <b>connections.</b> Based on an original dataset of 15, 279 low-income households, this paper studies the incidence and determinants of illegality in the context of low-income urban favelas. The probability of engaging in illegal behavior is explained not just by low income, but by a combination of concurring factors: sub-standard energy provision and equipment; inefficient/incorrect use of domestic electric appliances and running an informal in-house business. These recurrent issues in the urban favelas aggravate a sense of exclusion from growth, which is generally recognized as a trigger of illegality. The impact of energy demand on energy-related illegality is carefully analyzed, and different empirical strategies adopted to circumvent some simultaneity problem between both decision processes. The effectiveness of consumption-based energy subsidies is also explored. In spite of some contrary arguments in the literature, in the context of peri-urban slums, such measures may exert a positive impact in mitigating illegal access and use of energy. Effectiveness will be enhanced by accompanying measures such as: perceivable improvements of equipment, metering and maintenance, promotion of beneficiaries' awareness of energy usage, and energy-saving behaviors.
