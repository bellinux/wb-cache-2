5|$|Each {{chapter of}} Yotsuba&! {{takes place on}} a specific, nearly {{sequential}} <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> common year starting on Wednesday. The year was initially believed to be 2003, coinciding with {{the date of the}} manga's serialization, but Azuma has stated that the manga always takes place in the present day. This allows the appearance of products created after 2003, such as the Nintendo DS Mr. Ayase plays in chapter forty-two.|$|E

5|$|The entire <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Jain monk {{is spent}} in {{ensuring}} that he observes his vow of ahimsa through mind, body and speech faultlessly. This seemingly extreme behaviour of the monks comes from a sense that every action, no matter however subtle, has a karmic effect which can bind soul and inhibit liberation, especially those that result in hiṃsā (injury).|$|E

5|$|Eventually, Shashthi came to {{represent}} all goddesses and forces responsible for causing diseases {{in children and}} their mothers, who needed to be propitiated on the sixth day after childbirth to prevent these illnesses. Consequently, Shashthi came to personify the sixth <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child's life. The sixth day of the lunar fortnight is itself called Shashti, a name derived from {{the name of the}} goddess. The Yajnavalkya Smriti, composed during Gupta rule between the 3rd and 5th centuries CE, describes the rites of Shashthi Puja in which Shashthi is worshipped on the sixth day after childbirth to ensure the protection of the newborn baby. According to one explanation for the worship of Shashthi on this day, folk belief associates this critical time in an infant's life with great susceptibility to diseases related to childbirth, such as puerperal fever and tetanus, and that worship of Shashthi is performed to help ward off these diseases.|$|E
5|$|In April 1957, his wife's health {{deteriorated}} {{and she was}} hospitalised. Although seriously ill, she recovered {{sufficiently to}} be moved home. On 4 May 1957, while preparing for his wife's homecoming, Kippenberger complained of a headache and then collapsed. Taken to hospital in a coma, he died the next <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cerebral haemorrhage. He was buried on 7 May at Karori Cemetery in Wellington with full military honours. Ruth Kippenberger watched the funeral procession of her husband from her hospital window; she died ten years later.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, English county cricket teams began playing a {{shortened}} version of cricket which only lasted for one day. Starting in 1962 with a four-team knockout competition {{known as the}} Midlands Knock-Out Cup, and continuing with the inaugural Gillette Cup in 1963, one-day cricket grew in popularity in England. A national Sunday League was formed in 1969. The first One-Day International match was played on the fifth <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rain-aborted Test match between England and Australia at Melbourne in 1971, to fill the time available and as compensation for the frustrated crowd. It was a forty over game with eight balls per over.|$|E

5|$|Jardine was not {{successful}} in the final Test, won by Australia. He {{was used as an}} opener, due to an injury to Sutcliffe, and made just 19 and a first ball duck. Once both of his innings were completed, on the fifth <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> match which lasted eight days, he left the match and set off across Australia to catch a boat to India for a holiday. It is not clear if this was planned or if he had simply had enough. Jardine never provided an explanation, to the Australian press nor afterwards. Later, Jardine wrote about the Australian crowds, complaining over their involvement, but praising their knowledge and judgement of the game and describing them as more informed than English crowds. He also expressed later reservations to Bob Wyatt about Percy Chapman, saying that he would have shot him if a gun was available. Jardine did not appear in first-class cricket in the 1929 season due to business commitments.|$|E
5|$|M-63 {{begins at}} the {{intersection}} of Niles, Scottdale and Miners roads southwest of St. Joseph in Royalton Township. M-139 runs on Niles Road northwest from Berrien Springs to this point and on Scottdale Road north of the intersection. M-63 follows Miners Road west and then Niles Road northwest of the junction, parallel to the St. Joseph River through residential areas {{on the outskirts of the}} twin cities. The highway meets Interstate 94 (I-94) at the latter's exit27 and continues through St. Joseph Township to the city of St. Joseph. In the city, after Washington Avenue, Niles Road becomes Niles Avenue and turns north. As part of its maintenance duties, the MDOT tracks traffic volumes on the state highways in a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a calculation of the average traffic level for any <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> year. The roadway segment along Niles Avenue north of the Napier Avenue intersection in 2009 had the highest traffic levels along all of M-63 at 22,263vehicles.|$|E
5|$|On October 18, 1952, Williams and Billie Jean Jones Eshlimar {{were married}} in Minden, Louisiana by a justice of the peace. It was the second {{marriage}} for both (each being divorced with children). The next day two public ceremonies were also held at the New Orleans Civic Auditorium, where 14,000 seats were sold for each. After Williams' death, a judge ruled that the wedding was not legal because Jones Eshlimar's divorce had not become final until eleven days after she married Williams. Williams' first wife, Audrey, and his mother, Lillie Williams, were the driving forces behind having the marriage declared invalid and pursued the matter for years. Williams had also married Audrey Sheppard before her divorce was final, on the tenth <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> required 60-day reconciliation period.|$|E

5|$|Reading {{finished}} the 1973–74 season in sixth position, one place {{higher than the}} previous year. Friday underwent an operation to have tattoos removed from his fingers during the summer break, and afterwards joined a hippie commune in Cornwall, neglecting to inform Reading of this latter decision. He was absent without explanation when training started for the 1974–75 season in July 1974, arriving only on the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> closed-doors friendly against Watford. Despite his lack of training, he far out-performed {{the rest of the}} team. He continued to play well when the League programme began the following month. By September 1974 he was attracting the interest of First Division sides Sheffield United and Arsenal. The former had been following him since the game at Barnsley back in February, when he had still been an amateur. Arsenal manager Bertie Mee personally attended Reading's 4–2 home win over Rotherham United on 12 September, but neither his team nor Sheffield United attempted to sign Friday.|$|E
5|$|The Inbetweeners 2 was {{released}} on 6 August 2014 in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, to positive reception from critics.

On 21 August, it {{was released}} in Australia, to a mixed reception, and topped the box office in its opening weekend.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets {{had planned}} to provide China with an atomic bomb {{complete}} with full documentation, but in 1959, amid cooler relations, the Soviets destroyed the device and papers instead. When Khrushchev {{paid a visit to}} China in September, shortly after his successful U.S. visit, he met a chilly reception, and Khrushchev left the country on the third <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> planned seven-day visit. Relations continued to deteriorate in 1960, as both the USSR and China used a Romanian Communist Party congress as an opportunity to attack the other. After Khrushchev attacked China in his speech to the congress, Chinese leader Peng Zhen mocked Khrushchev, stating that the premier's foreign policy was to blow hot and cold towards the West. Khrushchev responded by pulling Soviet experts out of China.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, Hutton volunteered for the army and was recruited to the Army Physical Training Corps as a sergeant-instructor. Although no first-class cricket was played during the war, league and charity cricket matches continued and Hutton played several high-profile matches in 1940. But in March 1941, his future in cricket was threatened by a serious injury. On the last <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> commando training course in York, Hutton fell in the gymnasium when a mat slipped from under him. He suffered a fractured left forearm and dislocated his ulna at the wrist. By the summer, surgery and rest initially looked to have repaired the injury; Hutton returned to his unit and resumed cricket, scoring a century in one game. However, he began to suffer increasing pain and underwent more surgery to graft bone from his legs onto the injured arm. A first operation failed, but the second attempt at the end of 1941 eventually proved successful. The surgery left him with a left arm almost two inches shorter than the right. He was discharged from the army in the summer of 1942 and, after a period of recovery, began work as a civilian for the Royal Engineers, inspecting the condition of government-owned properties. Hutton's recovery and return to cricket was closely followed by the wartime press, which kept track of many pre-war cricketers.|$|E
5|$|Because of the academy's congressional {{nomination}} process, {{students come}} from all 50states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, the Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the US Virgin Islands. The academy is also authorized up to 60international exchange cadets, who undergo the same four-year curriculum as fully integrated members of the Corps of Cadets. Cadets attend the United States Military Academy free of charge, with all tuition and board {{paid for by the}} Army in return for a service commitment of five years of active duty and three years of reserve status upon graduation. Starting on the first <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cadet's second class year, non-graduates after that point are expected to fulfill their obligations in enlisted service. Cadets receive a monthly stipend of $1,017.00 for books, uniforms, and other necessities, as of 2015. From this amount, pay is automatically deducted for the cost of uniforms, books, supplies, services, and other miscellaneous expenses. In addition the monthly pay that the remaining amount ranges from $100 to $400 in the first three years, cadets receive meals in the dining halls, and have access to the Internet and a phone in their barracks. The student population was 4,487 cadets for the 2007–2008 academic year. The student body is 15.1% female. Ninety-two percent of entering students re-matriculated for a second year; the four-year graduation rate was 80% and the six-year rate was 81%.|$|E
