2500|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, ironworkers in Western Europe had {{developed}} the cementation process for carburizing wrought iron. Wrought iron bars and charcoal were packed into stone boxes, then sealed with clay {{to be held}} at a red heat continually tended in an oxygen-free state immersed in nearly pure carbon (charcoal) for up to a week. [...] During this time, carbon diffused into the surface layers of the iron, producing cement steel or blister steelalso known as case hardened, where the portions wrapped in iron (the pick or axe blade) became harder, than say an axe <b>hammer-head</b> or shaft socket which might be insulated by clay to keep them from the carbon source. [...] The earliest place where this process was used in England was at Coalbrookdale from 1819, where Sir Basil Brooke had two cementation furnaces (recently excavatedin 20012005). [...] For a time in the 1610s, he owned a patent on the process, but had to surrender this in 1619. [...] He probably used Forest of Dean iron as his raw material, but it was soon found that oregrounds iron was more suitable. [...] The quality of the steel could be improved by faggoting, producing the so-called shear steel.|$|E

6000|$|In {{spite of}} all I have said in a general way, there were {{some parts of the}} Land of Oz not quite so {{pleasant}} as the farming country and the Emerald City which was its center. Far away in the South Country there lived in the mountains a band of strange people called <b>Hammer-Heads,</b> because they had no arms and used their flat heads to pound any one who came near them.

6000|$|As much {{carpentry}} as a traveller {{is likely}} to want can be effected {{by means of a}} small axe with a <b>hammer-head,</b> a very small single-handed adze, a mortise-chisel, a strong gouge, a couple of medium-sized gimlets, a few awls, a small Turkey-hone, and a whetstone. If a saw be taken, it should be of a sort intended for green wood. In addition to these, a small tin box full of tools, all of which fit into a single handle, is very valuable; many travellers have found them extremely convenient. There is a tool-shop {{near the bottom of the}} Haymarket and another in the Strand near the Lowthier Arcade, where they can be bought; probably also at Holtzapfel's in Trafalgar Square. The box that contains them is about six inches long by four broad and one deep; the cost is from 20s. to 30s. Lastly, a saw for metals, a few drills, and small files, may be added with advantage. It is advisable to see that the tools are ground and set before starting. A small [...] "hard chisel" [...] of the best steel, three inches long, a quarter of an inch wide, and three-eighths thick--which any blacksmith can make--will cut iron, will chisel marks on rocks, and be useful in numerous emergencies.|$|E
60|$|Axes.--The axes made in England for {{the purpose}} of being taken out to Switzerland, may be divided into two classes, namely: travellers' axes, {{intended}} to be used for chipping a few occasional steps, for enlarging and clearing out those imperfectly made, and for holding on to a snow-slope,--and guides' axes, which are the heavier implements required for making long staircases in hard blue ice. We have had three models prepared, of which diagrams are appended; the first two represent the lighter axe, or what we have termed the travellers' axe; and the third, the heavier instrument required for guides' work. Diagram No. 1 represents a light axe or pick, of a kind somewhat similar to that recommended by Mr. Stephen, in a paper published a short time ago in the 'Journal.' It has, in the first place, the great advantage of lightness and handiness, while its single blade, to some extent, combines the step-cutting qualities possessed by the two cutters of the ordinary double-headed axe, though the latter instrument is on the whole decidedly superior. The small hammer-headed axe, though the latter instrument is on the whole decidedly superior. The small <b>hammer-head</b> at the back is added in order to balance the pick, and in some degree to improve the hold when the axe-head comes {{to be used as a}} crutch handle. This form, it should be understood, we recommend on account of its lightness and of its convenient shape. Diagram No. 2 represents a travellers' axe, slightly heavier than the first; and as this is the shape which appears to us the best adapted for mountain work of all kinds, we desire shortly to state our reasons for recommending it to members of the Club.|$|E

They were designed to deliver a strong impact and concentrate energy on a small area and cause damage through the plate. Maces, war hammers and the <b>hammer-heads</b> of pollaxes (poleaxes) were used to inflict blunt trauma through armour. Strong blows to the head might result in concussion even if the armor is not penetrated.|$|R

40|$|According to Eurocode 8, {{earthquake}} resistant steel building frames {{shall be}} designed following either the “low dissipative structural behaviour concept” or the “dissipative structural behaviour concept”. In the second concept, {{the capability of}} parts of the structure to resist earthquake actions through inelastic behaviour is taken into account: energy is dissipated in plastic mechanisms. In such a design, {{it has to be}} ensured that the dissipative zones form where they are intended to and that they yield before other zones leave the elastic range. In particular, moment resisting frames are designed {{in such a way that}} plastic hinges develop at the extremities of the beams. These dissipative zones can be located either in the beams or in the beam-to-column joints. In this paper, non-dissipative bolted beam-to-column connections are considered. They must be sufficiently resistant to remain in elastic range while cyclic yielding develops in the dissipative zones located in the beams. Besides, the possibility that the actual yield strength of the beam is higher than the nominal value has to be taken into account by a material overstrength factor. Such an approach generally leads to very strong and thus expensive joints. In the present paper, a design strategy leading to more economical solutions for full-strength beam-to-column joints is detailed. This study was conducted within the framework of an RFCS project called HSS-SERF (High Strength Steel in Seismic Resistant Building Frames). The considered moment-resisting joints are part of seismic resistant building frames made of high strength steel composite columns and mild carbon steel beams. The columns are either partially-encased wide-flange columns (H columns) or concrete-filled rectangular hollow-section columns (RHS columns). The proposed joint configuration uses <b>hammer-heads</b> extracted from the beam profile. To fulfil the resistance requirement taking account of the possible overstrength of the beam, the resistant moment of the joint is decomposed in the contributions of the different components involved. Then, no overstrength factor needs to be considered for the components related to the beam itself and to the <b>hammer-heads.</b> This approach is in full accordance with the basic principles of Eurocode 8 and can decrease much the required resistance of the joints provided some conditions are fulfilled, meaning lower costs.

5000|$|The {{theory has}} been {{advanced}} that the hammer-like shape of the head may have evolved (at least in part) to enhance the animal's vision. [...] The positioning of the eyes, mounted {{on the sides of}} the shark's distinctive hammer head, gives the shark good 360° vision in the vertical plane, meaning they can see above and below them at all times. The shape of the head was previously thought to help the shark find food, aiding in close-quarters maneuverability and allowing sharp turning movement without losing stability. However, it has been found that the unusual structure of its vertebrae was instrumental in making the turns correctly, more often than the shape of its head, though it would also shift and provide lift. From what is known about the winghead shark, the shape of the <b>hammer-head</b> apparently has to do with an evolved sensory function. Like all sharks, hammerheads have electroreceptory sensory pores called ampullae of Lorenzini. By distributing the receptors over a wider area, like a larger radio antenna, hammerheads can sweep for prey more effectively.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Small-scale and artisanal {{fisheries}} for sharks {{exist in}} most inshore, tropical {{regions of the}} world. Although often {{important in terms of}} food security, their low value and inherent complexity provides an imposing hurdle to sustainable management. An observer survey of a small-scale commercial gill-net fishery operating within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area revealed at least 38 species of elasmobranch were present in the catch. Of the total elasmobranch catch, 95 % was 25 species of Carcharhiniformes from the families Carcharhinidae, Hemigaleidae and Sphyrnidae. Individual species were captured {{in a variety of ways}} by the fishery, often with strongly biased sex ratios and in a variety of life stages (e. g. neonates, juveniles, adult). Despite this, the main carcharhiniform taxa captured could be qualitatively categorised into four groups based on similar catch characteristics, body size and similarities in life history: small coastal (, 1000 mm); medium coastal (1000 – 2000 mm); large coastal/semi-pelagic (. 2000 mm); and <b>hammer-heads.</b> Such groupings can potentially be useful for simplifying management of complex multispecies fisheries. The idiosyncrasies of elasmobranch populations and how fisheries interact with them provide a challenge for management but, if properly understood, potentially offer underutilised options for designing management strategies...|$|R

40|$|The {{perception}} of tool–object pairs involves understanding their action-relationships (affordances). Here, {{we sought to}} evaluate how an observer visually encodes tool–object affordances. Eye-movements were recorded as right-handed participants freely viewed static, right-handed, egocentric tool–object images across three contexts: correct (e. g. hammer-nail), incorrect (e. g. hammer-paper), spatial/ambiguous (e. g. hammer-wood), and three grasp-types: no hand, functional grasp-posture (grasp hammer-handle), non-functional/manipulative grasp-posture (grasp <b>hammer-head).</b> There were three areas of interests (AOI) : the object (nail), the operant tool-end (<b>hammer-head),</b> the graspable tool-end (hammer-handle). Participants passively evaluated whether tool–object pairs were functionally correct/incorrect. Clustering of gaze scanpaths and AOI weightings grouped conditions into three distinct grasp-specific clusters, especially across correct and spatial tool–object contexts {{and to a lesser}} extent within the incorrect tool–object context. The grasp-specific gaze scanpath clusters were reasonably robust to the temporal order of gaze scanpaths. Gaze was therefore automatically primed to grasp-affordances though the task required evaluating tool–object context. Participants also primarily focused on the object and the operant tool-end and sparsely attended to the graspable tool-end, even in images with functional grasp-postures. In fact, in the absence of a grasp, the object was foveally weighted the most, indicative of a possible object-oriented action priming effect wherein the observer may be evaluating how the tool engages on the object. Unlike the functional grasp-posture, the manipulative grasp-posture caused the greatest disruption in the object-oriented priming effect, ostensibly as it does not afford tool–object action due to its non-functional interaction with the operant tool-end that actually engages with the object (e. g., <b>hammer-head</b> to nail). The enhanced attention towards the manipulative grasp-posture may serve to encode grasp-intent. Results here shed new light on how an observer gathers action-information when evaluating static tool–object scenes and reveal how contextual and grasp-specific affordances directly modulate visuospatial attention...|$|E

40|$|We have {{captured}} {{the structure of a}} pre-catalytic conformational inter-mediate of the hammerhead ribozyme using a phosphodiester tether formed between I and Stem II. This phosphodiester tether appears to mimic interactions in the wild-type hammerhead RNA that enable switch-ing between nuclease and ligase activities, both of which are required in the replicative cycles of the satellite RNA viruses from which the <b>hammer-head</b> ribozyme is derived. The structure of this conformational inter-mediate reveals how the attacking nucleophile is positioned prior to cleavage, and demonstrates how restricting the ability of Stem I to rotate about its helical axis, via interactions with Stem II, can inhibit cleavage. Analogous covalent crosslinking experiments have demonstrated that imposing such restrictions on interhelical movement can change the ham-merhead ribozyme from a nuclease to a ligase. Taken together, these results permit us to suggest that switching between ligase and nuclease activity is determined by the helical orientation of Stem I relative to Stem II. q 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
