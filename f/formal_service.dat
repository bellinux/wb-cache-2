25|$|A second {{purpose of}} {{reservation}} {{is that it}} might be a focus of prayer. In the 3rd century, catechumens baptized at Easter or Pentecost might spend eight days in meditation before the Blessed Sacrament, reserved in a home-church, before Christianity was legalized. However, only since the year 1000, or even later, was the Blessed Sacrament kept in churches so that the faithful might visit It or pray before It. Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament in the Roman Catholic Church and Anglican Churches for the purposes of adoration has been current since the 14th century and may be either private (expositio privata), where only the doors of the tabernacle are opened, or public exposition where the Host is placed in a monstrance so that it may be more readily seen. Public exposition, formerly permitted only on the feast of Corpus Christi, developed only in recent centuries into a <b>formal</b> <b>service</b> known as Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament.|$|E
25|$|Other items {{brought to}} the altar during the Divine Liturgy include a gold or silver chalice with red wine, a small {{metallic}} urn of warm water, a metallic communion spoon, a little metallic spear, a sponge, a metal disk with cut pieces of bread upon it, and a star, which is a star-shaped piece of metal over which the priest places a cloth covering when transporting the holy gifts {{to and from the}} altar. Also found on the altar table is the antimins. The antimins is a silk cloth, signed by the appropriate diocesan bishop, upon which the sanctification of the holy gifts takes place during each Divine Liturgy. The antimins contain the relics of a saint. When a church is consecrated by a bishop, there is a <b>formal</b> <b>service</b> or prayers and sanctification {{in the name of the}} Saint that the church is named after. The bishop will also often present a small relic of a saint to place in or on the altar as part of the consecration of a new church.|$|E

Financial inclusion initiatives aim to expand the reach and attractiveness of <b>formal</b> financial <b>services.</b> Recently, the Financial Action Task Force embraced financial inclusion as complementary to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing as it enhances financial transparency. Analyzing preliminary data from FinScope surveys on eight African countries we argue that an increase in access to <b>formal</b> <b>services</b> does not automatically imply an immediate and corresponding reduction of usage of informal services, especially as many individuals use informal and <b>formal</b> <b>services</b> in parallel.

40|$|AbstractEfforts to {{strengthen}} national child protection systems have frequently taken a top-down approach of imposing <b>formal,</b> government-managed <b>services.</b> Such expert-driven approaches are often characterized by low use of <b>formal</b> <b>services</b> and the misalignment of the nonformal and formal {{aspects of the}} child protection system. This article examines an alternative approach of community-driven, bottom-up work that enables nonformal–formal collaboration and alignment, greater use of <b>formal</b> <b>services,</b> internally driven social change, {{and high levels of}} community ownership. The dominant approach of reliance on expert-driven Child Welfare Committees produces low levels of community ownership. Using an approach developed and tested in rural Sierra Leone, community-driven action, including collaboration and linkages with the formal system, promoted the use of <b>formal</b> <b>services</b> and achieved increased ownership, effectiveness, and sustainability of the system. The field needs less reliance on expert-driven approaches and much wider use of slower, community-driven, bottom-up approaches to child protection...|$|R

2500|$|Manuscript Torah scrolls {{are still}} scribed {{and used for}} ritual {{purposes}} (i.e., religious services); {{this is called a}} Sefer Torah ("Book [...] Torah"). They are written using a painstakingly careful methodology by highly qualified scribes. This has resulted in, according to B.

[...] However, he writes that this [...] "simply does not accord with the facts." [...] It is believed that every word, or marking, has divine meaning, and that not one part may be inadvertently changed lest it lead to error. The fidelity of the Hebrew text of the Tanakh, and the Torah in particular, is considered paramount, down to the last letter: translations or transcriptions are frowned upon for <b>formal</b> <b>service</b> use, and transcribing is done with painstaking care. An error of a single letter, ornamentation, or symbol of the 304,805 stylized letters that make up the Hebrew Torah text renders a Torah scroll unfit for use, hence a special skill is required and a scroll takes considerable time to write and check.|$|E

When spouses are compared to other coresiding caregivers, patterns of informal care and use of <b>formal</b> <b>services</b> are similar.

This article demonstrates that there are three different care systems: the informal, the commercial and the formal (public) system. In terms of prevalence, the formal system is the least important one. By means of a cross-sectional sample of the elderly population of Antwerp, an Andersen model is estimated to explain the use of <b>formal</b> <b>services.</b> This model shows that the level of functional capacity of the elderly is a crucial factor. Yet, the effect this has on the use of care varies according to the different living arrangements. "Need" as such, therefore, does not determine the use of <b>formal</b> <b>services,</b> since its effect is modified by the different alternatives that are at the disposal of the elderly person (living arrangements, informal care, income, availability of commercial alternatives). In the conclusion it is argued that the Andersen model, in a cross-sectional design, is inadequate to construct a theory concerning the use of care services. elderly utilization determinants social services Belgium...|$|R
