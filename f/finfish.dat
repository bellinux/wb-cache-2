5|$|The strict {{biological}} {{definition of}} a fish, above, is sometimes called a true fish. True fish are {{also referred to as}} <b>finfish</b> or fin fish to distinguish them from other aquatic life harvested in fisheries or aquaculture.|$|E
5|$|The bay {{is noted}} for its superfund site, caused by mercury {{pollution}} from the heavy industry in Point Comfort (specifically Alcoa), across the bay from the largest settlement of Port Lavaca. Although fishing has declined in recent years due to fears of contamination, the bay supports a large <b>finfish</b> population, and the efforts of environmental organizations {{and the federal government}} have pressured Alcoa to reduce the polluted areas.|$|E
40|$|Information on seed {{resources}} of cultivable marine <b>finfishes</b> along the Indian coast and their culture potential in ponds, pens, net enclosures and cages is given. The available cultivable areas, methods and management techniques for mariculturc of <b>finfishes</b> in India arc presented. The prospects {{for development of}} fish farms, cages, pens, and net enclosures are highlighted.

40|$|Data on the {{trophic level}} (TrL) of 707 species of {{exploited}} <b>finfishes,</b> {{crustaceans and cephalopods}} along the Indian coast were collected from different sources. The TrL ranges from 2. 0 to 4. 7 and the mean TrL is 3. 5. The mean TrL of pelagic <b>finfishes</b> is 3. 68, and the TrL decreased towards demersal habitat (3. 44). A strong positive correlation exists between maximum body length of <b>finfishes</b> and TrL. The mean TrL of exploitation was 3. 25. The complexities of assigning TrL values are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Fishing methods being practised in {{the reef}} {{areas of the}} Gulf of Mannar for <b>finfishes</b> are trawling, gillnetting, fishing by hooks and lines and traps. Out of these, the most {{important}} device is trawling by which the most diverse and the highest quantity of <b>finfishes</b> are being landed from coral reef areas in this region...|$|R
5|$|Carancahua Bay is {{protected}} by the State of Texas and locally by the 300-member Carancahua Bay Protection Association. It is a nursery bay for shrimp, and is a habitat for shellfish including oysters. <b>Finfish</b> such as the redfish and black drum are commonly caught from the bay by recreational fishermen. Birds common to the bay include the wood ibis, roseate spoonbill, snowy egret, great-tailed grackle, Louisiana heron, willet, black-necked stilt, caracara and the black vulture.|$|E
5|$|Amnesic {{shellfish}} poisoning (ASP) {{was first}} reported in eastern Canada in 1987. It {{is caused by}} the substance domoic acid found in certain diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Bivalves can become toxic when they filter these microalgae out of the water. Domoic acid is a low-molecular weight amino acid that is able to destroy brain cells causing memory loss, gastroenteritis, long-term neurological problems or death. In an outbreak in the western United States in 1993, <b>finfish</b> were also implicated as vectors, and seabirds and mammals suffered neurological symptoms. In the United States and Canada, a regulatory limit of 20µg/g of domoic acid in shellfish meat is set.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the wild}} stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and non-food {{products}} were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species {{of plants and animals}} were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included <b>finfish,</b> aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts, and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed farmed shellfish from the waste being produced by farmed salmon. Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for <b>finfish</b> can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|E
40|$|Demersal <b>finfishes</b> {{are one of}} {{the major}} {{components}} in the marine fish landings along the Indian coast. Demersal fish groups such as the sharks, groupers, snappers, threadfins, porn frets and Indian halibut are commercially valuable and contribute substantially to the economy of Indian marine fisheries.

40|$|Demersal <b>finfishes</b> {{are one of}} {{the major}} {{components}} in the marine fi sh landings along the Indian coast. Demersal fish groups such as the sharks. groupers. snappers. threadfins, porn frets and Indian halibut are commercially valuable and contribute substantially to the economy of Indian marine fi sheries. Some of these groups, especially of large-size, are targeted by the fishermen by using different craft and gear combinations. However, several other demersal <b>finfishes</b> are not targeted, but are landed as bycatch by shrimp trawlers. Compared with the pelagics, the demersal <b>finfishes</b> are less affected by the changes in the environment. such as changes in temperature, speed and direction of currents. Hence, the biological characteristics of the demersals are relatively stable. Consequent upon {{the increase in the number}} and efficiency of trawlers, the demersal landings have increased in the last 40 years. However, indiscriminate trawling in the last one decade has affected the bottom habitat and the demersal resources as well. ow there are evidences of decline in the stocks of few demersal groups and shift in the composition of the landings...|$|R
5|$|Laguna Madre {{is home to}} more <b>finfish</b> than {{anywhere}} else on the Texas coast, with such species as blue catfish, hardhead catfish, Atlantic croaker, black drum, red drum, southern flounder, alligator gar, houndfish, crevalle jack, southern kingfish, ladyfish, Atlantic midshipman, mojarras, striped mullet, pinfish, Florida pompano, smooth butterfly ray, spotted seatrout, blacktip shark, sheepshead, bigmouth sleeper, gray snapper, common snook, southern stargazer, southern stingray and tripletail. Many fowl migrate and live around the lagoon including 75% of all redhead ducks. Other birds in the area include the peregrine falcon, piping plover, roseate spoonbill, long-billed curlew, crane, egret and the brown pelican. Sea turtles and dolphins {{can be found in}} the bay, while cattle, white-tailed deer, nilgai and bobcats can sometimes be seen near the shore.|$|E
5|$|The Nueces estuary {{provides}} an ecosystem {{for a wide}} variety of wildlife. However, since the construction of Choke Canyon Reservoir in 1985, freshwater inflows have decreased from the Nueces River, increasing the bay's salinity, and hurting the natural oyster and shrimp habitat. In response, the City of Corpus Christi, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and two additional state agencies have worked to restore the natural freshwater inflows into the bay. The Odem Bay extension is low in salinity and serves as a nursery for shrimp, which migrate to Nueces Bay in spring. Oyster beds are common throughout the bay and are known to be hiding spots for such fish as trout, black drum, flounder and redfish. Such <b>finfish</b> must be protected from excessive freshwater introduction for survival.|$|E
5|$|Whirling {{disease was}} first {{detected}} in fish in Johnson Lake in Banff National Park in May, 2016. CFIA Labs confirmed in August and Parks Canada announced the outbreak August 23, 2016. Although {{it was first}} discovered in Banff, {{it is not necessarily}} where the disease originated and spread. The Government of Alberta is currently sampling and testing fish in 6 different watersheds (Peace River, Athabasca, North Saskatchewan, Red Deer, Bow and Oldman) to see where the disease has spread. Initial sample fish were collected in 2016, and are currently being processed by the Government of Alberta and CFIA labs. Since testing began, it has been detected in the Upper Bow River, and in May 2017 it was confirmed that whirling disease had also been detected in the Oldman River Basin. The declaration does not mean that every susceptible <b>finfish</b> population within the Bow and Oldman River watersheds are infected with the disease.|$|E
40|$|Demersal fishes {{are those}} fishes which live and feed {{on or near}} the bottom of seas. They occupy the sea floors, which usually consist of mud, sand, gravel or rocks. In coastal waters they are found {{on or near the}} {{continental}} shelf, and in deep waters they are found on or near the continental slope or along the continental rise. In India, demersal <b>finfishes</b> contribute about 26 % to the total marine fish landings of the country, which is dominated by perches, croakers, catfishes, silverbellies, elasmobranchs, lizardfishes, flat fishes, pomfrets, etc., in order of abundance.

5|$|Copano Bay is a northwestern {{extension}} of Aransas Bay, west of Rockport, Texas in Refugio and Aransas counties. It is supplied with seawater from the Gulf of Mexico via Aransas Bay, and fed freshwater from the Aransas River, Mission River and Copano Creek. As an estuary, the bay {{is home to}} a diverse ecosystem consisting of various birds including the endangered whooping crane, and numerous <b>finfish</b> including the redfish as well as shellfish such as oysters. It is classified as a nursery for shrimp, which prohibits production from the bay. Copano Bay is also a historic location for human usage and settlement that dates back to the 18th century, beginning with the historic port of El Copano and the 19th century settlements of St. Mary's of Aransas and Copano. The present-day towns of Bayside, Copano Village and Holiday Beach were all founded in the 20th century. Oil and natural gas are pumped from below the bay's surface, and contribute to the livelihood of the local economies. Recently, areas around the bay were affected by Hurricane Harvey which crossed over the bay as a Category 3 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Saint Charles Bay {{serves as}} a habitat for {{approximately}} 300 species of birds. Birders venture to the site between November and March, when the creatures winter near the bay. The endangered whooping crane, the largest bird in North America, is the most highly prized sight as {{only a few hundred}} remain, including three families on St. Charles Bay. The bird was near extinction in the early 20th century, as only two flocks between Canada and Texas remained. The population increased following the organization of the Aransas Migratory Waterfowl Refuge in 1937, after the Federal government purchased the land of the St. Charles ranch from San Antonio oilman Leroy G. Denman, using funds from commemorative stamps. The Refuge later became known as the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Whooping cranes are also protected by Goose Island State Park, which was established by the State of Texas in 1931. Other birds that migrate to the bay include the sandhill crane, American white pelican, brown pelican, roseate spoonbill, great blue heron and Canada goose. The blue crab and other shellfish, help sustain the bird population. Thirty seven species of mammals are found on Blackjack peninsula, including white-tailed deer, nine-banded armadillos and collared peccaries. The spotted seatrout and redfish are the common <b>finfish</b> that reside in the bay. While trout are generally found in the bay's deeper waters, redfish live in shallow waters; their tail fins can be spotted above the surface during the peak summer and fall months. The bay also supports a healthy population of American alligators, which reside in shallow waters. Signs alert visitors to be careful.|$|E

40|$|Currently our {{government}} and the private sectors are very much interested {{in the establishment of}} marine aquaculture. For the successful operation in aquaculture of <b>finfishes</b> and shellfishes, the basic requirement is the suitable diet, apart from proper environment. For the larvae, juveniles and adult stages of the culturing organisms the live Artemia is the ideal food. The aquaculturists the worldover are using live food for their culturing organisms, as the live food {{played an important role in}} the dietary management of aquaculture of <b>finfishes</b> and shellfishes (Sorgeloos and Kulasekarapandian, 1984), particularly during larval stages. The live nauplii of Artemia are used in aquaculture of <b>finfishes</b> and shellfishes due to being nutritionally balanced, non polluting, economically bearable, viable and readily acceptable to the culturing species. The adult Artemia is also used for feeding the aquarium fishes particularly so when there is a clear abundance of this resource which is cheaper and can economically compete with alternative artificial diet. By the use of Artemia the aquaculturists may obtain optimum growth and survival rate of the organisms. The life cycle of Artemia is very short, which is completed within two weeks especially during dry season in highly saline waters, the two weeks old Artemia starts producing cysts. These cysts become ready to harvest within a week...|$|R
