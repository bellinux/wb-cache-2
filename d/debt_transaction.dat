40|$|Contrary to {{conventional}} wisdom, this paper {{contends that the}} excessive development of capital market finance {{has been one of}} the catalysts behind the crises and scandals that have unfolded over the past 15 years. In particular, innovative <b>debt</b> <b>transactions</b> have proven instrumental to the creation of excessive levels of risk-taking and leverage, which have had catastrophic consequences, both at the firm and systemic level. While much regulation has been enacted in response to these crises, the way in which <b>debt</b> <b>transactions</b> in capital markets are designed and entered into remains largely unregulated. Moreover, regulators have so far neglected the role that leverage and debt creation play in the economy and their consequences for the wider social context. Moreover, the recent policy design in the EU is promoting a renewed implementation of an old design, the Capital Markets Union (CMU). This revolves around disintermediated, market-based forms of financing, which should represent an alternative to the traditionally predominant (in Europe) bank-based financing channel. This paper finds that the European policy design fails to appreciate the dangers associated with capital markets finance and its ensuing debt-creating effects. It argues that, despite some regulatory efforts, a suitable architecture for the regulation of disintermediated capital markets is still missing...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{legal and}} cultural history of personal debt in mid-nineteenth-century Moscow region. Historians have shown how the judicial reform of 1864 dismantled an old legal apparatus that was vulnerable to administrative interference and ultimately depended upon the tsar's personal authority, replacing it with independent judges, jury trials, and courtroom oratory. But as many legal scholars will agree, political rhetoric about law and high-profile appellate cases fail to capture the full diversity of legal phenomena. I therefore study imperial Russian law in transition {{from the perspective of}} individuals who used the courts and formed their legal strategies and attitudes about law long before the reform. I do so through close readings of previously unexamined materials from two major archives in Russia: the Central Historical Archive of Moscow and the State Archive of the Russian Federation, including the records of county- and province-level courts and administrative bodies, supplemented by the records of the charitable Imperial Prison Society. I also analyze the relevant legislation found in imperial Russia's Complete Collection of the Laws. Specific topics covered in the study include the cultural and social profiles of creditors and debtors and of their relations, the connection between debt and kinship structures and strategies, the institution of debt imprisonment and its rituals, various aspects of court procedure, as well as the previously unstudied issue of white-collar crime in imperial Russia. I have found that debt was ubiquitous in Russian life, as in other pre-industrial societies in which cash was scarce, incomes erratic, and formal credit institutions insufficient. It was also overwhelmingly personal, relying heavily on kinship, acquaintance, and the reputations of borrowers and lenders. My research contradicts the conventional view of Russian society at mid-century as a system of predominantly separate and closed estates. The system of private credit centered in Moscow connected merchants, civil servants, and the landowning gentry, and even wealthy peasants, some of whom lived or owned property in far-away provinces (privately-owned serfs were of course subordinate to their landlords in matters involving property). The credit network was sufficiently extensive and diverse to place an additional burden on Russia's already overworked legal system. The central theme of my study is the engagement of ordinary Russian lenders and borrowers of varying wealth and status, male and female, {{with each other and with}} the legal system (and through it with the state) during a crucial turning point in Russia's social and political history. My research also questions the dominant notion of a closed system of inquisitorial justice in pre-reform courts. The cases I examined reveal the pre-reform legal process as messy, incomplete, polyphonic, and open to extra-legal influences, including those of tsarist administrative officials. Private individuals retained significant discretion and initiative both according to the law and in practice, beginning with the way a <b>debt</b> <b>transaction</b> was formalized and ending with the decision to imprison a debtor or to commit an insolvent to a criminal trial. I therefore argue that pre-reform law with all its faults was a site of conflict, cooperation, and negotiation among diverse individuals seeking to protect and promote their property interests and between private persons and government officials. I show the law to be a key tool for Russia's propertied classes for asserting their own rights against other private individuals and/or against the state. Thus, I reinterpret the relationship between individuals and the administration, modifying the commonly held view of the Nicholaevan bureaucracy as a monolith imposing itself on the tsar's subjects. As the only study of imperial civil law in practice, this dissertation offers unique evidence on the operations of state and society in Russia at the key period of the Great Reforms, as well as establishes a basis for understanding subsequent legal developments...|$|E

40|$|LL. M. The {{concept of}} a <b>debt</b> {{defeasance}} <b>transaction</b> has recently come under scrutiny in the South African financial market. In the financial arena lower lending rates and efficient tax planning are of paramount consideration to corporate entities seeking to raise finance and to properly structure their affairs. <b>Debt</b> defeasance <b>transactions</b> recognise the time value of money. Companies with long-term borrowings obtain financial advantages if those borrowings can be retired early as {{the present value of}} the liability is less than the face value thereof. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a comparative study of the manner in which <b>debt</b> defeasance <b>transactions</b> have been dealt with in the Australian jurisdiction and how the South African courts would view the income tax consequences of such transactions. The choice of the Australian jurisdiction finds its motivation in the similarity of the income tax regime of that country with the system applied in South Africa. Although the Australian income tax legislation allows for a wider range of income to be recognised as assessable income (hence the frequent references to "income according to ordinary concepts" in the judicial pronouncements in that country) the {{concept of a}}n accrual of income is recognised and applied in the Australian legislation in a similar manner to that of the South African income tax legislation. In addition, there have been a number of recent decisions in the Australian courts on <b>debt</b> defeasance <b>transactions</b> that were implemented during the 1980 's. Given that the South African courts are mindful of developments in 2 Australia and will seek guidance from that jurisdiction, the contemporary nature of the Australian decisions referred to below is insightful and useful in a comparative study. The conclusions reached in this dissertation are that the income tax benefits sought by the parties to the transaction and which are pivotal to the success of the transaction, will not be available in the South African context, just as they are not available in Australia. In certain circumstances the debt defeasance profit, as it is termed in this paper, will be fully taxable in the hands of the taxpayer to whom it accrues, particularly in regard to instantaneous defeasances and where the taxpayer is a financial institution. It is this outcome of the application of the general principles of the South African income tax legislation that leads to the failure of the transaction as a fund raising tool in the structured finance environment. Thought has been given to whether or not the South African legislation should be amended to cater specifically for the <b>debt</b> defeasance <b>transaction.</b> There are no issues that are created by these transactions, such as mismatches in the timing of accruals and deductions as is the case in the trading of financial instruments, that are not already catered for in the current income tax legislation. The main enquiry in determining the consequences of a <b>debt</b> defeasance <b>transaction</b> is in the application of the gross income definition in section 1 of The Income Tax Act 58 of 1962. The application of the gross income definition is trite law and the judicial pronouncements thereon are 3 adequate guidance and it is submitted that no amendment to the Income Tax Act is required to cater for <b>debt</b> defeasance <b>transactions.</b> The structure of this paper will be to give an overview of the mechanics of <b>debt</b> defeasance <b>transactions</b> and the defeasance transactions and the consequences thereof. A survey of the Australian examples of debt defeasances is undertaken and the judgements given by the Australian courts in response to such transactions are canvassed. An analysis will finally be undertaken on the income tax consequences of debt defeasances as they have been imported into South Afric...|$|R
