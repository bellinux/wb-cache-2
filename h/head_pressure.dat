5000|$|<b>Head</b> <b>pressure</b> - The <b>head</b> <b>pressure</b> of a {{sump pump}} {{describes}} the maximum height that the pump will move water. For instance, a sump pump with a 15 feet (4.6 m) maximum head (also called a shutoff head) will raise water up 15 feet (4.6 m) before it completely loses flow. Technically, <b>head</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is defined as}} an expression of a pressure in terms of the height of fluid; P = yρg, where y is the fluid column height, ρ is fluid density and g is the acceleration of gravity. Other considerations may be added to overall <b>head</b> <b>pressure,</b> including loss from elbows/bends and friction loss from long horizontal runs.|$|E

30|$|Performance of {{different}} stages in multi-stage open-loop impedance pump as function for <b>pressure</b> <b>heads</b> and flow rates was compared and analyzed. The performance was compared non-dimensionally where the <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> is {{with respect to}} the initial <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> at water level of 250  mm and the flow rate is {{with respect to the}} maximum flow rate induced (7.64  L min− 1) in a conventional single-stage system. Performance of a single-stage system was made the benchmark of comparison where the highest flow rate achieved is normalized to the number of 1. The <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> on the other hand was observed to reach the highest increment of normalized value 0.6 giving a total <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> difference of 1.2.

Comparing with the previous trend of performance of multi-stage system, the four-stage system had obviously decreases in its performance.

Improvement of 10 % in <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> was shown comparing with two-stage system; it was however shown a decrease of 5.9 % comparing flow rate in four- and two-stage system.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{operating}} <b>pressure</b> <b>heads</b> on water application uniformity in microirrigation submain units was evaluated. Research {{results show that}} water application uniformity either increases or slightly decreases as operating <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> increases in a range when the emission exponent x {{less than or equal}} to 0. 5 in most cases. The water application uniformity decreases as operating <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> increases in a range when the emission exponent x > 0. 5. The relationship between operating <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> and average emitter discharge in submain units can be considered as approximately linear for operating <b>pressure</b> <b>heads</b> in a small range (usually between the allowable minimum and maximum operating pressures of the submain units). These results help to estimate the average emitter discharge rate easily in a submain unit for an increased or decreased operating <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> when one is attempting to manage emitter discharge dynamically according to the requirements of crop root growth for different periods. Generally, a microirrigation system designed to meet the desired uniformity of water application according to the allowable minimum operating <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> would be better when x {{less than or equal to}} 0. 5 because water application uniformity increases as operating pressure increases if emitter discharges are being managed dynamically. However, a microirrigation system designed to meet the required water application uniformity according to the allowable maximum operating <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> would be better when x > 0. 5 because, in general, water application uniformity increases as operating pressure decreases...|$|R

40|$|In modeling, actual crop {{transpiration}} as {{a function}} of soil hydraulic conditions is usually estimated from a water content or <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> dependent reduction function. We compared the performance of the empirical <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> based reduction function of Feddes (FRF) and a more physically based reduction function using matric flux potential as the main parameter (DRF), both available in the SWAP ecohydrological model. Model performance was evaluated by comparison of SWAP predictions and observed water contents and <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> values in a field experiment with a common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) crop. For > 50 d, no rain occurred and the soil reached very dry conditions with <b>pressure</b> <b>heads</b> in the range - 100 to - 150 m. The SWAP-DRF-predicted <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> and water content values were less sensitive to root length density distribution than those predicted by SWAP-FRF. Varying wilting <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> did not improve predictive performance. Root water uptake distribution with time and depth simulated by SWAP showed very different patterns depending on the reduction function used. Root water uptake estimated by SWAP-FRF showed smooth transitions with time and between layers, whereas SWAP-DRF, highly sensitive to hydraulic conditions, generally predicted uptake to be concentrated at a few depths. The order of magnitude of the <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> difference between root xylem and root surface based on SWAP-DRF-predicted uptake rates, root length density, and reported values of root conductance was the same as the order of magnitude of the limiting root water <b>pressure</b> <b>head,</b> implying the necessity to include root hydraulic resistance in the DRF...|$|R

40|$|Wetting front {{instability}} {{creates a}} shallow induction zone from which fingers emerge that rapidly transport water and solutes downwards. How the induction zone affects finger location and spacing is unknown. In the moist subsoil, fingers may well dissipate because the finger tips {{no longer have}} to overcome the water entry value. Both flow regions were investigated in a two-dimensional chamber with a fine-over-coarse glass bead porous medium. A capillary fringe was created by upward wetting through capillary rise. Upon ponding with dye-coloured water, fingers emerged, propagated downward and diverged when reaching the capillary fringe. Microtensiometers were installed in the induction zone, the fingers, and in the capillary fringe. In the induction zone, a lateral sinusoidal <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> developed within minutes. Only in one of two experiments could the observed <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> pattern be satisfactorily reproduced by a steady-state model assuming uniform induction zone properties and uniform infiltration. Later, fingers emerged below the <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> minima. The induction zone did not affect finger properties. The <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> in the induction zone was determined by the depth of the finger tips. The water requirement of the fingers dictated the lateral <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> gradients. The <b>pressure</b> <b>heads</b> in the capillary fringe supported the hypothesis that the flow stabilised and dissipated there.
