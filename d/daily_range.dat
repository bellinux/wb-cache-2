25|$|Mercury's {{equatorial}} plane is inclined less than 2° to its orbital plane (Klaasen, 1976; Murray and others, 1981, p. 28); its rotation period of 58.64 terrestrial days is in two- thirds resonance with its orbital period of 87.97 terrestrial days (Colombo, 1965; Colombo and Shapiro, 1966). The resulting lag and orbital eccentricity create {{a variation of}} mean temperature not only with latitude, as on the Earth, but also with longitude. However, because of Mercury's relatively slow rotational period, diurnal variations in temperature probably greatly exceed mean-temperature variations along latitude and longitude, even in the high latitudes. Its pronounced orbital eccentricity (0.2563) causes the apparent solar intensity at Mercury to vary {{by more than a}} factor of 2 throughout a Mercurian year, corresponding to about a 20 percent change in equilibrium temperature. Further, conservation of orbital angular momentum and spin-orbit coupling cause considerable variation in the length of daylight. Dawns and sunsets are prolonged by the long transit time of the Mercurian horizon across the solar disk, so that daylight is lengthened and nighttime reduced by several terrestrial days at sunset and vice versa at sunrise (Robert Wildey, U.S. Geological Survey, oral commun., 1982). Despite these considerations and despite the <b>daily</b> <b>range</b> in surface temperatures of several hundred kelvins, the subsurface temperature in the polar regions always remains well below freezing (Murray, 1975).|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, we analyze new {{possibilities}} in predicting <b>daily</b> <b>ranges,</b> i. e. {{the differences between}} daily high and low prices. The main focus of our work lies in investigating how models commonly used for <b>daily</b> <b>ranges</b> modeling can be enhanced to provide better forecasts.

2500|$|On 18 December 2014, the Swiss {{central bank}} {{introduced}} a {{negative interest rate}} on bank deposits to support its CHF ceiling. However, with the euro declining in value over the following weeks, in a move dubbed Francogeddon for its effect on markets, the Swiss National Bank abandoned the ceiling on 15 January 2015, and the franc promptly increased in value compared with the euro by 30%, although this only lasted {{a few minutes before}} part of the increase was reversed. The move was not announced in advance and resulted in [...] "turmoil" [...] in stock and currency markets. By the close of trading that day, the franc was up 23% against the euro and 21% against the US dollar. The full <b>daily</b> <b>range</b> of franc was equal to $31,000 per single futures contract (to the positive if long, to the negative if short), and is more than the market moved collectively in the previous thousand days. [...] The key interest rate was also lowered from −0.25% to −0.75%, meaning investors would be paying an increased fee to keep their funds in a Swiss bank account. This devaluation of the euro against the franc is expected to hurt Switzerland's large export industry.

6000|$|Observations {{bearing on}} {{the second of the}} three points have been made by Becquerel in France, by La Cour in Jutland and Iceland, and by Rivoli at Posen. The results are {{perfectly}} congruous. Becquerel's observations[51] were made under wood, and about a hundred yards outside in open ground, at three stations in the district of Montargis, Loiret. There was a difference of more than one degree Fahrenheit between the mean annual temperatures in favour of the open ground. The mean summer temperature in the wood was from two to three degrees lower than the mean summer temperature outside.
