40|$|International audienceThe {{motion of}} {{cellulose}} whiskers trapped in agarose hydrogels {{is measured by}} depolarized dynamic light scattering (DDLS) under conditions of optical heterodyning, in which the rigid polymer network provides a static depolarized reference signal. At low concentration in <b>free</b> <b>suspension,</b> the rotational relaxation rate Theta of the whiskers is decoupled from the osmotic properties of the suspension. When incorporated inside a gel, however, as the agarose concentration increases, Theta first increases beyond that in the <b>free</b> <b>suspension,</b> reflecting a reduced amplitude of rotational fluctuations of the whiskers due to the repulsive interactions with their surroundings. At the same time, the dynamic light scattering Rayleigh ratio R-VH obtained from DDLS decreases with increasing gel concentration. At high gel concentrations, however, Theta tends to decrease due to the steric hindrance of the network. Except at the lowest whisker concentrations, Theta is governed by the same fluctuations as those associated with R-VH...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study immobilized cell {{cultures}} of Juniperus chinensis were developed using various calcium alginate gel concentrations (1. 8, 3 and 6 % w/v). The podophyllotoxin productivity of immobilized cell cultures was compared with that for <b>free</b> cell <b>suspension</b> cultures.

40|$|A <b>free</b> <b>suspension</b> {{model of}} the {{biodegradation}} of RDX by a consortium has been developed {{as a part of}} an overall model that will describe the waste treatment for explosives in a continuous process. The <b>free</b> <b>suspension</b> model uses experimentally determined parameters to predict the concentrations of the bacteria cells, the substrate (yeast extract), RDX, and the mononitroso intermediate. The model correctly predicts the experimentally observed trends; however, the values predicted for the cell concentrations are consistently lower than those observed experimentally. This can be resolved by better characterizing the growth parameters of the consortium. The degradation of RDX was found to be first order in RDX concentration and assumed to be first order in cell concentration, X. i. e. d(RDX) /dt = k{sub 1 }(X) (RDX) The degradation rate constant, k{sub 1 }, was found to be 0. 043 L/(g cells hr).

40|$|When {{neoplastic}} cells grow in confined {{spaces in}} vivo, they exert a finite {{force on the}} surrounding tissue resulting in the generation of solid stress. By growing multicellular spheroids in agarose gels of defined mechanical properties, we have recently shown that solid stress inhibits the growth of spheroids and that this growth-inhibiting stress ranges from 45 to 120 [*]mmHg. Here we show that solid stress facilitates the formation of spheroids in the highly metastatic Dunning R 3327 rat prostate carcinoma AT 3. 1 cells, which predominantly do not grow as spheroids in <b>free</b> <b>suspension.</b> The maximum size and {{the growth rate of}} the resulting spheroids decreased with increasing stress. Relieving solid stress by enzymatic digestion of gels resulted in gradual loss of spheroidal morphology in 8 days. In contrast, the low metastatic variant AT 2. 1 [*]cells, which grow as spheroids in <b>free</b> <b>suspension</b> {{as well as in the}} gels, maintained their spheroidal morphology even after stress removal. Histological examination revealed that most cells in AT 2. 1 spheroids are in close apposition whereas a regular matrix separates the cells in the AT 3. 1 gel spheroids. Staining with the hyaluronan binding protein revealed that the matrix between AT 3. 1 cells in agarose contained hyaluronan, while AT 3. 1 cells had negligible or no hyaluronan when grown in <b>free</b> <b>suspension.</b> Hyaluronan was found to be present in both free suspensions and agarose gel spheroids of AT 2. 1. We suggest that cell–cell adhesion may be adequate for spheroid formation, whereas solid stress may be required to form spheroids when cell–matrix adhesion is predominant. These findings have significant implications for tumour growth, invasion and metastasis...|$|E

Unfortunately, the measured category vanishes easily.

This synergy was analysed (i) by evaluation of the proliferative response at each step of the purification process leading to separation of T and Null cells; (ii) by back-mixing T and Nul cells at different rations; and (iii) by evaluation of the proliferative response of <b>free</b> <b>suspension</b> cultures of T cells overlaying a semi-solid layer containing Null cells, or of <b>free</b> <b>suspension</b> cultures of Null cells over a semi-solid culture layer of T cells. The following conclusions were reached: (i) purified Null cells are unresponsive to mitogen when cultured alone or in the presence of diffusible T-cell products; (ii) the T cells are less responsive when cultured alone than in the presence of Null cells or diffusible Null cell products. Thus the synergistic effect observed between T and Null cells is not due to the promotion of Null-cell proliferation by T -cell products but can be accounted for by diffusible Null-cell products enhancing the process of T lymphocyte activation by mitogens...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the stability and dispersion behaviour of aqueous alumina suspensions in the presence of polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide (PEO/PPO/PEO) type block copolymers. The influence of water soluble triblock copolymers with molecular weight ranging from 2900 to 12600 g/mole were tested at Φ = 0. 125, 1, 10, 20 vol % solid loading alumina suspensions by rheological, turbidity, sedimentation and surface tension measurements. The results indicate that an alternative dispersant for alumina suspensions is the PEO/PPO triblock copolymers. Their stabilisation mechanism was attributed to the depletion stabilisation. Rheological measurements indicated that these block copolymers (at high EO percentages) coupled with ultrasonic treatment have a positive effect on the dispersion of the agglomerated alumina suspensions. It was not possible to create stable dispersions in the absence of ultrasonic bath treatment. Turbidity measurements at Φ = 0. 025, 0. 125 vol % showed that, alumina suspensions with PEO/PPO added were stable and have higher turbidity values than block copolymer <b>free</b> <b>suspensions...</b>|$|R

The BioGIT system adequately simulated the average albendazole gastrointestinal transfer process and concentrations in upper small intestine after administration of the <b>free</b> base <b>suspensions</b> to fasted adults. However, the degree of supersaturation observed in the duodenal compartment was greater than in vivo. Albendazole sulfate resulted in minimal increase of albendazole concentrations in the duodenal compartment of the BioGIT, despite improved equilibrium solubility observed in human aspirates and biorelevant media, indicating that the use of a salt is unlikely to lead to any significant oral absorption advantage for albendazole...|$|R

40|$|Chloropropham-degrading {{cultures}} {{were obtained}} from sludge and soil samples by using two different enrichment techniques: (i) planktonic enrichments in shaken liquid medium and (ii) biofilm enrichments on two types of solid matrixes (plastic chips and gravel). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting showed that planktonic and biofilm cultures had a different community composition depending on the presence and type of added solid matrix during enrichment. This {{was reflected in the}} unique chloropropham-degrading species that could be isolated from the different cultures. Planktonic and biofilm cultures also differed in chloropropham-degrading activity. With biofilm cultures, slower chloropropham removal was observed, but with less build-up of the toxic intermediate 3 -chloroaniline. Disruption of the biofilm architecture resulted in degradation characteristics shifting toward those of the <b>free</b> <b>suspensions,</b> indicating the importance of a well-established biofilm structure for good performance. These results show that biofilm-mediated enrichment techniques can be used to select for pollutant-degrading microorganisms that like to proliferate in a biofilm and that cannot be isolated using conventional shaken-liquid procedures. Furthermore, the influence of the biofilm architecture on the pesticide degradation characteristics suggests that for bioaugmentation the use of biofilm catabolic communities might be a proficient alternative to using planktonic freely suspended cultures...|$|R
