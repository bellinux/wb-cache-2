5000|$|AON {{orders are}} similar to <b>fill</b> <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> (FOK) <b>orders,</b> but the former focuses on [...] "complete vs. partial fulfillment", whereas the latter hinges on the immediacy of the transaction.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>fill</b> <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> (FOK) <b>order</b> is [...] "an {{order to}} buy or sell a stock that must be {{executed}} immediately"—a few seconds, customarily—in its entirety; otherwise, the entire order is cancelled; no partial fulfillments are allowed.|$|R
5000|$|An {{immediate}} or cancel (IOC) order, {{also known}} as an [...] "accept order", is a finance term used in investment banking or securities transactions that refers [...] "an order {{to buy or sell}} a stock that must be executed immediately". In case the entire order is not available at that moment for purchase a partial fulfillment is possible, but any portion of an IOC order that cannot be filled immediately is cancelled, obviating the need for manual cancellation. This [...] "partial fulfillment" [...] aspect is what differentiates IOC orders from all or none (AON) and <b>fill</b> <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> (FOK) <b>orders.</b>|$|R

50|$|Both buy {{and sell}} orders can be {{additionally}} constrained. Two {{of the most common}} additional constraints are <b>fill</b> <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> (FOK) and all or none (AON). FOK orders are either filled completely on the first attempt or canceled outright, while AON orders stipulate that the order must be filled with the entire number of shares specified, <b>or</b> not <b>filled</b> at all. If it is not filled, it is still held on the order book for later execution.|$|R

The United States believes that releasing him is a very bad idea, that the evidence is clear, {{and that he is}} likely to commit more acts of resistance against US occupation forces if released. Officials in the military commissions system in the United States have begun procedures to charge Daqduq with war crimes (specifically, that he <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>killed</b> four US soldiers captured during a raid); the future of this is unclear.|$|R

Shortly after, Gilles moved to Machecoul where, as the record of his confession states, he <b>killed,</b> <b>or</b> <b>ordered</b> to be <b>killed,</b> a great but uncertain number of children after he sodomized them.

50|$|Otto {{has been}} {{infected}} by Animus, an organic supercomputer {{which can be}} programmed by H.O.P.E. to make Otto do their evil bidding. With a superhuman assassin called Ghost, he attacks members of G.L.O.V.E. Raven is on her own mission to find Sebastian Trent, but first goes to a facility where there might be people with information. She gets to Khan and threatens him, so he starts to unlock his computer. As he is typing in his password though, he is killed by a remote-controlled microexplosive device in his skull. She takes the laptop and just then, Nero picks her up {{to take her to}} the G.L.O.V.E. council meeting. At that meeting with the remaining G.L.O.V.E. members, who are waiting for Darkdoom to slip up, Darkdoom is pressured to make a decision. Eventually, Darkdoom issues a capture <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> <b>order</b> for Otto. During a later private meeting with Nero, Raven sees a sniper (Ghost) and just barely saves Darkdoom from being assassinated. While Darkdoom is in the H.I.V.E. medical center being healed, Professor Pike and Laura Brand try to fix the school's sporadic technical problems. Raven tries to hack through the Khan's laptop with Professor Pike's help, and she finds a picture of a seed in one picture. After consulting the biotechnology teacher, she discovers that this seed is most commonly found in the Amazon, which is where she is headed. Wing, who desperately wants to find Otto, stows away with her on the Shroud, but the pair of them are captured by H.O.P.E. Meanwhile, amidst the chaos at H.I.V.E., Nero brings another expert on artificial intelligence—a newly freed Cypher, to help investigate. They believe it to be Overlord, but it is actually H.I.V.E.mind rebuilding himself. Organic supercomputers always automatically repair themselves as seed programs, and when they reach the self-awareness stage, they are able to control what they are doing.|$|R
50|$|A {{dense fog}} this morning made it {{extremely}} difficult to determine enemy movements, and consequently only a few shots were fired from the Danish guns in the bastions as the Prussians close in on Mysunde. At 11:30, the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Danish Regiment arrived at Mysunde {{under the command of}} Captain Arntz, and along with a squadron of dragoons, the force carried out a reconnaissance in front of the bastions. A thousand paces in front of the bastions, they encountered the fusilier battalions of the 15th and 24th Prussian Regiments and came under intense fire. Lieutenant Hagemann of the 24th Regiment became the first Prussian officer to be killed; while Major v. Krohn lead the Fusilier Battalion in a bayonet attack that threw the Danish infantry back. With several officers wounded <b>or</b> <b>killed,</b> Captain Arntz <b>ordered</b> his battalion into position at the bastions. It is only at this point, that the Danish commanders realised that they were facing not just a Prussian reconnaissance force, but an actual assault on the fortifications.|$|R
50|$|To {{cope with}} the situation, Germany sent 14,000 {{additional}} troops who soon crushed the rebellion in the Battle of Waterberg in 1905. Earlier von Trotha issued an ultimatum to the Herero, denying them citizenship rights and ordering them {{to leave the country}} <b>or</b> be <b>killed.</b> In <b>order</b> to escape, the Herero retreated into the waterless Omaheke region, a western arm of the Kalahari Desert, where many of them died of thirst. The German forces guarded every water source and were given orders to shoot any adult male Herero on sight. Only a few of them managed to escape into neighbouring British territories. These tragic events, known as the Herero and Namaqua Genocide, resulted in the death of between 24,000 and 65,000 Herero (estimated at 50% to 70% of the total Herero population) and 10,000 Nama (50% of the total Nama population). The genocide was characterized by widespread death by starvation and from consumption of well water which had been poisoned by the Germans in the Namib Desert.|$|R

50|$|A new Spy Smasher, {{government}} agent Katarina Armstrong, {{created by}} Gail Simone, first appears in Birds of Prey #100 (January 2007). She is a high-ranking anti-terrorism agent who {{is affiliated with}} several American, Commonwealth, and United Nations agencies (see table). Her relation to Alan Armstrong has not been revealed, though her secret identity and costume seem clearly inspired by him. She is depicted in her first appearances as having a domineering demeanor, and is not hesitant to <b>kill</b> <b>or</b> <b>order</b> deaths in order to complete a mission. Having forced Oracle to work for her, she plans {{to take over the}} Birds of Prey organization and usurp Oracle's position. Issue #103 indicates that Katarina and Oracle were friends in college. At some point prior to Katarina's debut, they became rivals. That issue shows a flashback of both women competing in a race, with Katarina beating Barbara by cheating but immediately confessing to the judges after she had won.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{caught by}} total {{surprise}} Michael Shishman attempted {{to bring his}} army to order {{but it was too}} late and the outnumbered Bulgarian units were crushed. The battle was bloody because the remaining Bulgarian forces on the battlefield stiffly resisted and according to some chroniclers the river reddened. Both sides suffered heavy casualties and the Bulgarian camp was looted by the Serbs. The Emperor himself was badly wounded, his horse killed under him and was captured by the coming enemy soldiers. He was taken to the Serbian camp where he probably expired from his wounds on the fourth day of his captivity, on 31 July. Some other theories suggest that he perished on the battlefield <b>or</b> was <b>killed</b> by <b>order</b> of Stefan Dusan. The body of the ill-fated Emperor Michael was brought to King Stefan and was consequently buried in the monastery of Staro Nagoričane (village Staro Nagoričane, near Kumanovo). [...] On the place where he spent his last night praying in his tent, Stefan built a church (still existent to this day).|$|R

2500|$|The Ordinamenti della Guistizia (Ordinances of Justice) of {{the medieval}} Italian {{city-state}} of Florence mandated a range of harsh penalties against nobles who <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> <b>ordered</b> the killing of citizens; the punishments included execution, the forfeiting of property and the razing of the offender's house. The ordinances were passed {{against the background of}} political and social conflict between powerful aristocrats and the ordinary citizens or popolares, and may have been a conscious imitation of the punishments meted out to overmighty aristocrats in the Roman Republic 1,300 years previously, when those suspected of aiming at tyranny risked not only execution but the destruction of their homes as well. This act was seen as a symbolic destruction of the offender's family and social status. To the Romans, the home {{was more than just a}} possession; it was a sacred space protected by the Di Penates (household gods) and was a focus for personal honour. Cicero suffered the loss and destruction of his homes at the hands of Publius Clodius Pulcher in 58 BC, and later spoke in his speech De Domo Sua ("About His House") of the [...] "dishonour" [...] and [...] "grief" [...] that he experienced as a result.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} the {{perceived}} justness of a call to jihad will resonate with the most dedicated and sincere audience and is {{a key component of}} the weaponization of the ideology. The response to this call generates ardent support in the form of individuals willing to <b>kill</b> <b>or</b> be <b>killed</b> in <b>order</b> to see the jihad succeed. In classical jihads, rulers were able to mobilize their nations for war when these conditions were met. Over time, the ideology of jihad has transformed in parallel with changes in the world system. Jihad rhetoric continues to be incorporated in the ideologies of non-state actors, who have arguably created ideological variants based on their own interpretations. This thesis seeks to explain how the Internet makes the jihad a potent global reality by negating the need for infidel alliances, personalizing the actions of its adherents and distributing the message and methods of jihad to an indeterminate number of actors. This thesis recommends that continual pressure in the form of infiltration or cooptation of these sites forces those who promote violent jihad ideologies to increase their cyber security measures, essentially raising the cost in terms of time if not money. While these groups have evidenced a tremendous capacity for organizational learning and have significant resources, these resources are not endless. Part of a successful counter ideological strategy needs to involve consistently applying pressure through the medium of the Internet in order to raise the stakes of the game and alter the radicalization process.

5000|$|According to {{the later}} Liber Historiae Francorum, Marcomer tried {{to unite the}} Franks {{after the death of}} Sunno. He {{proposed}} that the Franks should live under one king and proposed his own son Pharamond (whose earliest mention is in this work, and who is considered mythological by scholars) for the kingship. This source does not relate whether Marcomer succeeded, but from other later sources that recall the account of Liber Historiae Francorum, the impression may be gained that Pharamond was regarded as the first king of the Franks. However, modern scholars, such as Edward James, do not accept this account in the Liber Historiae Francorum as historical, because Marcomer is called the son of the Trojan king Priam. Traditionally Marcomer is also known as Marcomir VI, and made a descendent of King Priam Podarces of Troy by Priam's son Helenus from whom the Kings of Cimmerian Bosporus are said to descend. Clovis I, according to Gregory of Tours, had several other rulers <b>or</b> kings <b>killed</b> in <b>order</b> to manipulate control and increase his territory, and through his machinations dethroned other leaders such as the Frankish counts of Trier, but even he was not the single Frankish king, for tribes as the Thuringii, Chamavi and Bructeri continued their own structures. After Clovis' death, his empire was divided again amongst his sons who ruled simultaneously over different areas.|$|R
