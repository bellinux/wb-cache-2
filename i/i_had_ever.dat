5|$|The website Allmusic {{called the}} song 'a tormented ballad about romantic loss and regret {{built on a}} spooky yet heart-wrenching piano melody'. The torment {{is present in the}} song's opening ('There were nights when the wind was so cold'), from which the singer recovers ('I {{finished}} crying in the instant that you left... And I banished every memory you and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> made'). However, the defiance in the verses are replaced by the return of the 'subservient' feelings in the chorus ('when you touch me like this, and you hold me like that...'); this juxtaposition continues throughout the song.|$|E
25|$|A lean loose-jointed Negro had {{commenced}} plunking {{a guitar}} beside me while I slept... As he played, he pressed a knife on {{the strings of}} the guitar in a manner popularized by Hawaiian guitarists who used steel bars....The singer repeated the line three times, accompanying himself on the guitar with the weirdest music <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> heard.|$|E
25|$|Such {{moments in}} life are just as memorable as when one is {{appointed}} to prominent positions. When my comrades took farewell to me, I was equally moved as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> been when I was given an important office. What I thought most about was that I had finished my duties towards the people, the Party and the state. This memory is very precious to me.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Niven met Hjördis Paulina Tersmeden (née Genberg, 1919–1997), a {{divorced}} Swedish fashion model. He recounted their meeting:I {{had never seen}} anything so beautiful in my life—tall, slim, auburn hair, up-tilted nose, lovely mouth and the most enormous grey eyes <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen. It really happened the way it does when written by the worst lady novelists... I goggled. I had difficulty swallowing and had champagne in my knees.|$|E
25|$|I {{jumped into}} a seal hole, pushing the ice away as I entered, and they handed me my camera. Surprisingly, I wasn't too cold, except around where my mouth {{held on to}} my regulator, and that {{instantly}} froze and became numb. Suddenly everything was quiet and I found myself looking at easily {{one of the most}} extraordinary scenes <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever,</b> ever experienced. When I dropped down {{through a hole in the}} ice, I was completely surrounded by ice: a tunnel maybe twenty feet across. Everything above me on the land was roaring with wind and down there, there was absolutely no sound except for the distant trills of Weddell seals.|$|E
25|$|The villa {{was sold}} in 1960 to the Vuilleumier family, who used it first as a private family home, {{and for the past}} few years as a hotel. In 1976 the American writer Gore Vidal (who lived in La Rondinaia, a nearby house built by Lucy Beckett, from 1972 to 2004) wrote of Villa Cimbrone: Twenty five years ago I was asked by an American {{magazine}} what was the most beautiful place that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen in all my travels and I said the view from the belvedere of the Villa Cimbrone on a bright winter's day when the sky and the sea were each so vividly blue that it was not possible to tell one from the other.|$|E

25|$|Polanski later stated that, in {{the months}} {{following}} the murders, he suspected various friends and associates, and his paranoia subsided only when the killers were arrested. Newspapers claimed that many Hollywood stars were moving out of the city, while others were reported to have installed security systems in their homes. Writer Dominick Dunne later recalled the tension:The shock waves that went through the town were beyond anything <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen before. People were convinced that the rich and famous of the community were in peril. Children were sent out of town. Guards were hired. Steve McQueen packed a gun when he went to Jay Sebring's funeral. In 1994, the Tate/Polanski house was demolished and a new house was constructed on the site with the street address changed to 10066 Cielo Drive.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E
500|$|When Little was in prison, he met fellow convict John Bembry, a self-educated man {{he would}} later {{describe}} as [...] "the first man <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen command total respect … with words". Under Bembry's influence, Little developed a voracious appetite for reading.|$|E

The best performance — I’ll say it right now — this is the most spectacular performance <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> seen against a guy in Barão who is easily one of the best pound-for-pound fighters on the planet. Congratulations on just a masterful work tonight. It was an honor calling this fight. Thank you very much, brother.|$|R

[...] An accident or injury in his youth caused him to lose part of his palette, and he spoke with a hoarse voice.|$|E
500|$|In July 1997, Nolan's girlfriend (later wife) Emma Thomas {{showed his}} {{screenplay}} to Aaron Ryder, an executive for Newmarket Films. Ryder said the script was, [...] "perhaps {{the most innovative}} script <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen", and soon after, it was optioned by Newmarket and given a budget of $4.5million. Pre-production lasted seven weeks, during which the main shooting location changed from Montreal, Quebec to Los Angeles, California, {{to create a more}} realistic and noirish atmosphere for the film.|$|E

After they had attended morning puja at this temple, at 4 am, Maharaj began singing a bhajan, a Hindu musical prayer. In the tradition of communal chanting, or kirtana, Harrison and the others there sang in response, repeating Maharaj's lines, for a period lasting up to five hours.|$|E

500|$|Additionally, Debs {{was visited}} in jail by Milwaukee socialist {{newspaper}} editor Victor L. Berger, who, in Debs' words, [...] "came to Woodstock, as if a providential instrument, and delivered the first impassioned message of Socialism <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> heard." [...] In his 1926 obituary in Time, {{it was said}} that Berger left him a copy of Das Kapital and [...] "prisoner Debs read it slowly, eagerly, ravenously." [...] Debs emerged from jail {{at the end of his}} sentence a changed man. He would spend the final three decades of his life proselytizing for the socialist cause.|$|E
500|$|On 2 April, as Bounty {{approached}} Cape Horn, {{a strong}} gale and high seas began an unbroken period of stormy weather which, Bligh wrote, [...] "exceeded what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> met with before... with severe squalls of hail and sleet". The winds drove the ship back; on 3 April, she was further north {{than she had}} been a week earlier. Again and again, Bligh forced the ship forward, to be repeatedly repelled. On 17 April, he informed his exhausted crew that the sea had beaten them, and that they would turn and head for the Cape of Good Hope—"to the great joy of every person on Board", Bligh recorded.|$|E
500|$|University of Missouri Tigers coach Tim Jamieson {{spotted him}} in a summer league, and {{convinced}} him to head east for his junior year. Jamieson said, [...] "I saw him take ground balls and thought, defensively, he was as good a middle infielder as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen. As for his bat, I didn't really care." [...] While there, Kinsler had a [...]335 batting average, [...]416 on-base percentage, and [...]536 slugging percentage, with 16 steals in 17 attempts. He {{was named to the}} All-Big 12 Conference second team. Jamieson noted, [...] "From the day Ian stepped through the doors here, you could see it on his face: He was on a mission." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{his first}} {{autobiography}} On a Wing and a Prayer former Australian winger David Campese called Ella ‘...the best rugby player <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> known or seen.'

500|$|After Hitler's {{mother died}} of breast cancer in 1907, the funeral {{procession}} went through Urfahr to Leonding. Kubizek remarks that Hitler said he had seen Stefanie at the funeral procession, which gave him some consolation. Kubizek claims that [...] "Stefanie had no idea how deeply Adolf was in love with her; she regarded him as a somewhat shy, but nevertheless remarkably tenacious and faithful, admirer. When she responded with a smile to his inquiring glance, he was happy and his mood became unlike anything <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> observed in him. But when Stefanie, as happened just as often, coldly ignored his gaze, he was crushed and ready to destroy himself and the whole world." ...|$|E
500|$|Bellomont's rule in New York was not remembered fondly. One {{political}} opponent, {{noting that}} the provincial debt rose substantially during his tenure, wrote that the memory of Bellomont [...] "will stink in the nostrills of all good men", and Robert Livingston reported that the debt was [...] "a greater Debt than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen". Bellomont's personal affairs were also difficult to tie up: his creditors tried (unsuccessfully) to prevent his wife's departure from the province in order to compel settlement of his personal debts. Bellomont's financial issues were not unique in this respect. Later governors (including Nanfan and Cornbury) were arrested on charges of malfeasance and personal indebtedness {{at the behest of}} their political opponents. New York's debt problems were not resolved until the Hunter administration in 1717.|$|E
500|$|Angus Young later recalled, [...] "I {{remember}} the first time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> heard Brian's (Johnson) name was from Bon. Bon had mentioned that he had been in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard.' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said we should see if we can find him." ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{followed}} by the most utterly objectionable and repulsive-looking person <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> set eyes on in my life--a young man, thin, and of less than medium height, flashily dressed in cheap clothes, with patent boots and brilliant necktie. His cheeks were sallow; and his eyes, deeply inset, were closer together than any <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> seen.|$|R
