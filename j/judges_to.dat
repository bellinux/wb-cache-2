5|$|Cleveland {{nominated}} 41 lower {{federal court}} judges {{in addition to}} his four Supreme Court justices. These included two <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> the United States circuit courts, nine <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> the United States Courts of Appeals, and 30 <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> the United States district courts. Because Cleveland served terms both before and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts of Appeals, he is one of only two presidents to have appointed <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> both bodies. The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office {{at the time that the}} change was made. Thus, all of Cleveland's appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term, and all of his appointments to the Courts of Appeals were made in his second.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{nominated}} 17 <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> the United States Courts of Appeals, and 61 <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> the United States district courts.

Coolidge also signed the Judiciary Act of 1925 into law, allowing the Supreme Court more discretion over its workload.|$|E

5000|$|Comments by supporters: Allowing {{a justice}} or <b>judge</b> <b>to</b> {{complete}} {{the term of}} office to which the individual was elected fulfills {{the intent of the}} electorate. A justice or <b>judge</b> is elected <b>to</b> serve a specific term of office, and in electing the justice or judge the voters have expressed a desire for the justice or <b>judge</b> <b>to</b> serve the entire term of office. Requiring a justice or <b>judge</b> <b>to</b> retire mid-term disrupts the efficient and orderly administration of justice. Immediate retirement requires cases being handled by the justice or <b>judge</b> <b>to</b> be delayed while a temporary justice or judge is selected. A case also may be delayed if a new justice or judge is elected and takes over a case from the temporary judge. The amendment includes a limited exception that treats a justice or <b>judge</b> elected <b>to</b> a six-year term of office {{in the same manner as}} a justice or <b>judge</b> elected <b>to</b> a four-year term of office.|$|R

5|$|Along {{with his}} two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton {{appointed}} 66 <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> the United States courts of appeals and 305 <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> the United States district courts. His 373 judicial appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan. Clinton also experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies, as 69 nominees to federal judgeships did not receive {{a vote in the}} Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee. In all, 84percent of his nominees were confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Another two judges, Justice Brennan and Justice Dawson, dissented, Justice Brennan {{arguing that}} it would not be proper for <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> use their power to adjourn trials to put {{pressure}} on the various legal aid agencies to change their decisions.|$|E
5|$|Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> the federal courts. In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton's court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women. Clinton appointed the first African American <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> the Fourth Circuit (Roger Gregory) and the Seventh Circuit (Ann Claire Williams). Clinton also appointed the nation's first openly gay or lesbian federal judge when he named Deborah Batts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote in 1994.|$|E

5|$|Taft {{appointed}} 13 <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> {{the federal}} courts of appeal and 38 to the United States district courts. Taft also appointed <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> various specialized courts, including the first five appointees each to the United States Commerce Court and the United States Court of Customs Appeals. The Commerce Court, created in 1910, stemmed from a Taft proposal for a specialized court to hear appeals from the Interstate Commerce Commission. There was considerable opposition to its establishment, which only grew when one of its judges, Robert W. Archbald, was in 1912 impeached for corruption and removed by the Senate the following January. Taft vetoed a bill to abolish the court, but the respite was short-lived as Wilson signed similar legislation in October 1913.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} judges, {{including}} Efraín Rivera Pérez, a former {{judge of the}} Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, and Héctor Laffitte, former federal judge, expressed themselves {{in favor of the}} amendments. Also, former two-time Superintendent of the Puerto Rico Police Department, Pedro Toledo, expressed himself in favor of the amendments. He added that some guidelines could be needed to allow <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> define the issue of the dangerousness of the accused.|$|E
5|$|After BC {{became a}} Canadian {{province}} in 1871, Crease devoted {{the next few}} years to fighting for judicial independence—specifically the right of <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> live outside their districts. In 1881 the BC Supreme Court, including Crease, ruled in the Thrasher case that the province's attempts to regulate judges were unconstitutional. This decision was overturned two years later by the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|E

Only one of the subjects in the Class I category was <b>judged</b> <b>to</b> be a reasonable candidate for Invisalign® (case 1 - 2), and the percentage of the raters who recommended extraction for this patient was the lowest in this category (19 %).|$|R
5|$|During his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that, {{if given}} the {{opportunity}}, he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice. That opportunity came {{in his first year}} in office when he nominated Sandra Day O'Connor to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart. In his second term, Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice, and named Antonin Scalia to fill the vacant seat. Reagan nominated conservative jurist Robert Bork to the high court in 1987. Senator Ted Kennedy, a Democrat of Massachusetts, strongly condemned Bork, and great controversy ensued. Bork's nomination was rejected 58–42. Reagan then nominated Douglas Ginsburg, but Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire for his cannabis use. Anthony Kennedy was eventually confirmed in his place. Along with his three Supreme Court appointments, Reagan appointed 83 <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> the United States courts of appeals, and 290 <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> the United States district courts.|$|E

5|$|Patton did {{not stop}} with the {{juvenile}} justice system, however. He encouraged passage of a bill that required that violent offenders serve at least 85percent of their sentences (up from the 50percent previously mandated), while requiring that judges consider home incarceration for first-time, non-violent offenders. The bill also allowed <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> sentence criminals to life without parole; previously, life without parole for 25years had been the harshest non-capital sentence. The bill passed the legislature in 1999.|$|E

5|$|The {{court can}} appoint retired judges, lawyers, and other <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> serve {{temporarily}} as judges {{at any level}} in Oregon. They can also appoint senior <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> serve on any state court at or below {{the highest level of}} court that judge had served on before retirement or resignation. The state supreme court is responsible for admitting new lawyers to practice in Oregon, disciplining attorneys, and appointing members to the Board of Bar Examiners. This board of a minimum of fourteen members is responsible for administering the bar exam and screening prospective lawyers before admitting applicants to practice law in Oregon. Oversight of state judges is also {{in the hands of the}} Supreme Court. The Commission on Judicial Fitness and Disability investigates all reports of abuses and makes recommendations to the Supreme Court on any actions that may need to occur. The Supreme Court can then suspend judges, censure them, remove them from office, or take no action.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} decision, {{reached by}} a majority of four <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> three, was that the Migration Act did permit indefinite detention. Each judge delivered a separate judgment with Justices McHugh, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon forming the majority, although Justice Heydon agreed entirely with Justice Hayne, and offered no extra reasoning. Chief Justice Gleeson and Justices Gummow and Kirby dissented, finding instead that the Migration Act should not be interpreted to permit indefinite detention.|$|E
