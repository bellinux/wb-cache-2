5|$|<b>Demeter,</b> Philitas' {{most famous}} work, {{consisted}} of elegiac couplets, or couplets in the elegiac meter. Its few surviving fragments {{suggest that it}} narrated the grain goddess Demeter's hunt for her daughter Persephone. The fragments describe Demeter's arrival on Cos and warm welcome by its royal family of Meropids, or humans twice normal size, thus presenting the founding myth of a local cult of <b>Demeter</b> on Cos.|$|E
5|$|In another story, {{based on}} an old folktale-motif, and echoing a similar theme, <b>Demeter</b> was searching for her daughter, Persephone, having taken {{the form of an}} old woman called Doso, and {{received}} a hospitable welcome from Celeus, the King of Eleusis in Attica. As a gift to Celeus, because of his hospitality, <b>Demeter</b> planned to make his son Demophon a god, but she was unable to complete the ritual because his mother Metanira walked in and saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright, which angered <b>Demeter,</b> who lamented that foolish mortals do not understand the concept and ritual.|$|E

5|$|Philitas was {{the first}} major Greek writer who was both a scholar and a poet. His {{reputation}} continued for centuries, based on both his pioneering study of words and his verse in elegiac meter. His vocabulary Disorderly Words described the meanings of rare literary words, including those used by Homer. His poetry, notably his elegiac poem <b>Demeter,</b> was highly respected by later ancient poets. However, almost all his work has since been lost.|$|E
5|$|The Greek poet Stasinos {{mentioned}} {{them in the}} Cypria {{amongst the}} flowers of Cyprus. The legend of Persephone comes to us mainly {{in the seventh century}} BC Homeric Hymn To <b>Demeter,</b> where the author describes the narcissus, and its role as a lure to trap the young Persephone. The flower, she recounts to her mother was the last flower she reached for before being seized.|$|E
5|$|The {{drama is}} based on Ovid's tale of the {{abduction}} of Proserpine by Pluto, which itself {{was based on the}} Greek myth of <b>Demeter</b> and Persephone. Mary Shelley's version focuses on the female characters. In a largely feminist retelling from Ceres's point of view, Shelley emphasises the separation of mother and daughter and the strength offered by a community of women. Ceres represents life and love, and Pluto represents death and violence. The genres of the text also reflect gender debates of the time. Percy contributed in the lyric verse form traditionally dominated by men; Mary created a drama with elements common to early nineteenth-century women's writing: details of everyday life and empathetic dialogue.|$|E

Among <b>Demeter's</b> poems a special place also takes his Pjesma Hrvata (Song of the Croats) which is an 8-syllable verse most known by its starting verse [...] "Prosto zrakom ptica leti".|$|R
5|$|Woodstock Mural is a mural {{designed}} by artist Mike Lawrence, {{painted on the}} west side of the New Seasons Market store in the Woodstock neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, in the United States. The painting has three sections, each representing a theme: commerce, education, and the outdoors. It depicts figures adorned with symbolism related to characters in Greek mythology, including Hermes, Athena, and <b>Demeter,</b> along with local businesses and local landmarks such as the neighborhood farmers' market, Grand Central Bakery, Portland Fish Market, Woodstock Park, and the Woodstock Library.|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the plants depicted in the stele fragment are either poppies or pomegranate flowers, however, classical archaeologists and historians of ancient Greek art discuss different species in the literature: German scholar Ernst Langlotz (1895–1978) thought that the women were holding a type of rose; Picard recognizes the symbolism of <b>Demeter</b> and Kore and identifies the flowers as a species of poppy, possibly the opium poppy, the Oriental poppy, or the Iranian poppy. Careful examination of the thick 'stems' fails to resemble that of the flowers. German scholar Eugen Petersen (1837–1919) proposed that the figures were holding knucklebones (talus bones from goats or sheep used {{to play the game}} of jacks) in their left hand and roses in the right hand; Hampe argues that the stele depicts only knucklebones, not flowers.|$|E
5|$|Once the Persians {{discovered}} that the Greeks had abandoned their positions {{and appeared to be}} in retreat, Mardonius decided to set off in immediate pursuit with the elite Persian infantry. As he did so, the rest of the Persian army, unbidden, began to move forward. The Spartans and Tegeans had by now reached the Temple of <b>Demeter.</b> The rearguard under Amompharetus began to withdraw from the ridge, under pressure from Persian cavalry, to join them. Pausanias sent a messenger to the Athenians, asking them to join up with the Spartans. However, the Athenians had been engaged by the Theban phalanx and were unable to assist Pausanias. The Spartans and Tegeans were first assaulted by the Persian cavalry, while the Persian infantry made their way forward. They then planted their shields and began shooting arrows at the Greeks, while the cavalry withdrew.|$|E

5|$|The {{mysteries of}} Isis were {{religious}} initiation rites {{performed in the}} cult of the goddess Isis in the Greco-Roman world. They were modeled on other mystery rites, particularly the Eleusinian Mysteries in honor of the Greek goddess <b>Demeter,</b> and originated sometime between the third century BCE and the second century CE. Despite their mainly Hellenistic origins, the mysteries did allude to beliefs from ancient Egyptian religion, in which the worship of Isis arose. By undergoing the mystery rites, initiates signaled their dedication to Isis, although they were not required to worship her exclusively. The rites were seen as a symbolic death and rebirth, and they may have been thought to guarantee that the initiate's soul, with the goddess's help, would continue after death in a blissful afterlife.|$|E
5|$|In the Bibliotheca, the Arcadian genealogies are {{immediately}} {{followed by the}} Atlantids, and this progression is known to mirror {{the structure of the}} Catalogue because other fragments of the papyrus roll that transmits the Telephus myth cover families of Atlas' daughters: Taygete, Electra, Alcyone, Sterope, Celaeno, Maia and Merope. Maia bore Hermes to Zeus on Mount Cyllene. Taygete also slept with Zeus, becoming the mother of Lacedaemon, through whom much of the Spartan line was traced, including Tyndareos, the father of Helen, and Penelope, the wife of Odysseus. To Zeus yet again Electra bore Dardanus, the progenitor of the Trojan line, and Eetion, who was killed for sleeping with <b>Demeter.</b> Dardanus' sons were Erichthonius and Ilus. Hyrieus and Hyperes were Poseidon's children by Alcyone. Her section included the Ehoie of Hyrieus' daughter Antiope, who bore Amphion and Zethus to Zeus. Hyperes' daughter Arethusa slept with Poseidon and was changed to a spring in Euboea, but not before bearing Abas, the eponym of the Abantes. His line is traced down to Elephenor, leader of the Abantes in the Trojan War. Sterope lay with Ares and bore Oenomaus, but it is possible that this union was delayed to book four as part of the section treating the family of Pelops and Oenomaus' daughter Hippodameia.|$|E
5|$|Isis {{was one of}} many non-Greek deities whose cults {{became part}} of Greek and Roman {{religion}} during the Hellenistic period (323–30 BCE), when Greek people and culture spread to lands across the Mediterranean and most of those same lands were conquered by the Roman Republic. Under the influence of Greco-Roman tradition, some of these cults, including that of Isis, developed their own mystery rites. The mysteries of Isis could have emerged {{as far back as the}} early third century BCE, after the Greek Ptolemaic dynasty had taken control of Egypt. The Ptolemies promoted the cult of the god Serapis, who incorporated traits of Osiris and of Greek deities like Dionysus and the underworld god Pluto. Isis's cult was conjoined with that of Serapis. She too was reinterpreted to resemble Greek goddesses, particularly <b>Demeter,</b> while retaining many of her Egyptian characteristics. The mysteries of Isis, modeled on those in Demeter's honor at Eleusis, could have been developed at the same time, as part of this mingling of Greek and Egyptian religion.|$|E

5|$|On 18 October Michael won {{a decisive}} {{victory against the}} army of prince-cardinal Andrew Báthory at the Battle of Şelimbăr, giving him control of Transylvania. As he retreated from the battle, Andrew Báthory was killed by anti-Báthory Székely on 3 November near Sândominic and Michael gave him a princely burial in the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Alba Iulia. With his enemy dead, Michael entered the Transylvanian capital at Alba Iulia and {{received}} {{the keys to the}} fortress from Bishop <b>Demeter</b> Naprágyi, later depicted as a seminal event in Romanian historiography. Historian István Szamosközy, keeper of the Archives at the time, recorded the event in great detail. He also wrote that two days before the Diet met on 10 October, Transylvanian nobles elected Michael the voivode as Prince of Transylvania. As the Diet was assembled, Michael demanded that the estates swear loyalty to Emperor Rudolf, then to himself and thirdly to his son. Even if he was recognized by the Transylvanian diet as only imperial governor subject to the Holy Roman Emperor, he was nonetheless ruler of Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|The Braves scored {{their fifth}} {{run in the}} eighth as Del Crandall hit a one-out triple and then scored on a {{sacrifice}} fly by Mantilla. Don <b>Demeter</b> pinch hit for Churn, the pitcher, in {{the bottom half of}} the inning but the Dodgers were put out in order. Sandy Koufax pitched the top of the ninth for the Dodgers and though he loaded the bases with three successive walks to Aaron, Torre, and DeMerit he did not allow any runs. Moon and Snider led off the bottom of the frame with successive singles. Bob Lillis pinch ran for Snider and Gil Hodges hit another single to load the bases. Don McMahon relieved Burdette, but allowed a fourth consecutive single to Norm Larker which scored Moon, Lillis, and advanced Hodges to third leaving the score 5–4. Warren Spahn relieved McMahon, Carl Furillo pinch hit for Roseboro, and Joe Pignatano pinch ran for Larker. Furillo tied the game, hitting a sacrifice fly which scored Hodges. Spahn allowed a single to Wills and was pulled in favor of Joey Jay. Ron Fairly grounded out as a pinch hitter and Gilliam flew out, leaving the game tied at five runs apiece and forcing extra innings.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers re-tied {{the game}} the next inning, however. Neal singled with one out and Wally Moon {{grounded}} into a force out at second base. Moon then advanced to second on a Larker single and scored on a Gil Hodges single to make the score 2–2. Don <b>Demeter</b> hit a single, the third consecutive and fourth of the inning, to load the bases but John Roseboro flew out to end the inning without further scoring. Sherry held the Braves scoreless {{in the bottom of}} the third, opening the inning with a walk but then inducing a double play and a foul out to quickly close it. Sherry and Willey traded scoreless innings in the fourth and fifth although the Braves threatened against Sherry in both innings, allowing two base-runners each time but escaping with no runs. Roseboro led off the top of the sixth inning with a home run to give the Dodgers a 3–2 lead. Roseboro had also hit a home run the day before against the Chicago Cubs, a game the Dodgers won to force the tie-breaker. Willey put out the next three batters to quickly end the inning, but the damage had been done.|$|E

2500|$|From {{the end of}} the 3rd century BC, <b>Demeter's</b> temple at Enna, in Sicily, was {{acknowledged}} as Ceres' oldest, most authoritative cult centre, and Libera was recognised as Proserpina, Roman equivalent to <b>Demeter's</b> daughter Persephone. Their joint cult recalls <b>Demeter's</b> search for Persephone, after the latter's rape and abduction into the underworld by Hades. The new cult to [...] "mother and maiden" [...] took its place alongside the old, but made no reference to Liber. Thereafter, Ceres was offered two separate and distinctive forms of official cult at the Aventine. Both might have been supervised by the male flamen Cerialis but otherwise, their relationship is unclear. The older form of cult included both men and women, and probably remained a focus for plebeian political identity and discontent. The new identified its exclusively females initiates and priestesses as upholders of Rome's traditional, patrician-dominated social hierarchy and morality.|$|R
