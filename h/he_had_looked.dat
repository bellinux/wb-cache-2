25|$|Sirisena was {{declared}} the winner after receiving 51.28% of all votes cast compared to Rajapaksa's 47.58%. The result was generally {{seen as a}} shock.

On 11 January 2015 the new government announced a special investigation into allegations of an attempted coup by Rajapaksa.|$|E

After choosing to travel instead by RV, he invited his family along with him.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle {{was educated}} in Paris at the Collège Stanislas and studied briefly in Belgium where he {{continued}} to display his interest in reading and studying history and shared the great pride many of his countrymen felt in their nation's achievements. At the age of fifteen he wrote an essay imagining “General de Gaulle” leading the French Army to victory over Germany in 1930; he later wrote that in his youth <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> forward with somewhat naive anticipation to the inevitable future war with Germany to avenge the French defeat of 1870.|$|E

25|$|For {{the second}} {{consecutive}} year, goaltending was a focus of training camp. After choosing to keep Luongo, the team did not hear from him. He had fired his longtime agent, and hired new representation. This development set off speculation that Luongo would not report to training camp and would try to force a trade. Shortly after the change in representation, his new agents announced that Luongo would attend training camp. In his first interview following the Schneider trade, Luongo stated that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> into voiding his contract, but he planned to honor it, and wanted to re-establish himself as an elite goaltender.|$|E
25|$|The Australians won the toss {{and full}} of {{confidence}} from the 1400 plus runs already compiled {{in the first two}} tests, decided to bat again. The pitch was not ideal, and rain threatened throughout, but a solid start from Taylor and Marsh took the tourists to 88 for the first wicket and threatened more of the same. Marsh (42) and Taylor (43) both made solid starts and kept the score tickeing over, but it was Allan Border's dismissal for 8 that actually changed Australia's innings for the better. Dean Jones came to the wicket with the Australians at 105 for 3, and looked determined for a well overdue big score. His last century had been a magnificent 216 against the West Indies the previous summer, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> frustrated so far in the current series.|$|E
25|$|Smuts and Botha were key negotiators at the Paris Peace Conference. Both were {{in favour}} of {{reconciliation}} with Germany and limited reparations. Smuts advocated a powerful League of Nations, which failed to materialise. The Treaty of Versailles gave South Africa a Class C mandate over German South-West Africa (which later became Namibia), which was occupied from 1919 until withdrawal in 1990. At the same time, Australia was given a similar mandate over German New Guinea, which it held until 1975. Both Smuts and the Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes feared the rising power of Japan in the post First World War world. When former German East Africa was divided into three mandated territories (Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanganyika) Smutsland {{was one of the}} proposed names for what became Tanganyika. Smuts, who had called for South African territorial expansion {{all the way to the}} River Zambesi since the late 19th century, was ultimately disappointed with the League awarding South-West Africa only a mandate status, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> forward to formally incorporating the territory to South Africa.|$|E

25|$|In April 1976, Spurrier {{was sent}} to the {{expansion}} Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for two players and a second round draft pick as part of the new franchise's first trade. The Buccaneers' new acquisition generated local excitement, as Spurrier had been a college star at the nearby University of Florida. He won the job as team's first starting quarterback, a position that he later regretted as the undermanned Bucs went on to suffer the first winless season (0-14) in modern NFL history. Though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> forward to playing professional football in Florida, Spurrier was frustrated by losing, the constant hits playing behind a porous offensive line, and his philosophical differences with Bucs coach John McKay. McKay insisted on employing a run-heavy attack similar to the offense he had used to win championships at The University of Southern California, while Spurrier felt that the team did not have the right personnel to run the ball effectively and should open up the offense. Another point of contention was Coach McKay's insistence that his son, John McKay, Jr., be the Buc's primary wide receiver while Spurrier and other observers felt {{that he did not have}} the talent to fill that role.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{continued}} their dominance throughout the second day. Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey {{continued their}} partnership, putting together 209. Flintoff finally took Hussey's wicket {{when he was}} on 86, bowled through the gate, with the off-stump out of the ground, when <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> set for a century. Matthew Hoggard finally made a significant breakthrough in the afternoon, taking the wickets of Ponting (for 196) and Adam Gilchrist (for a duck) in the same over, both men out lbw. Gilchrist, in particular, was out to a ball bowled from around the wicket from the right-arm bowler Hoggard, a continuation of England's tactics against him in the 2005 Ashes series, which had restricted him to a top score of 49*. Ponting's 196 allowed him to surpass Graham Gooch as the seventh highest Test runscorer of all time (Gooch scored 8900 runs). Michael Clarke crafted a solid 56 before falling to James Anderson, edging a good delivery to slip. Australia's tail wagged, with Brett Lee scoring 43 and Stuart Clark hitting a quick-fire 39 off 23 balls before having his leg stump knocked out of the ground by Flintoff. His innings included two huge sixes off the bowling of James Anderson, who ended the innings with figures of 141 runs for just one wicket. Australia were able to declare their innings with the score 9/602 after tea.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} Speed's claim is unclear; {{it was not}} {{attributed}} to any source, nor did it have any antecedents in other written accounts. The writer Audrey Strange suggests that the account may be a confused retelling of desecration of the remains of John Wycliffe in nearby Lutterworth in 1428, when a mob disinterred him, burned his bones and threw them into the River Swift. The independent British historian John Ashdown-Hill proposes that Speed made a mistake over the location of Richard's grave and invented the story to account for its absence. If Speed had been to Herrick's property he would surely have seen the commemorative pillar and gardens, but instead he reported that the site was [...] "overgrown with nettles and weeds" [...] {{and there was no}} trace of Richard's grave. The map of Leicester drawn by Speed incorrectly shows Greyfriars where the former Blackfriars was, suggesting that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> for the grave in the wrong place.|$|E
