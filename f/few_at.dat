5|$|By February 1945 the {{seventeen}} aircraft of {{the second}} increment were themselves in need of upgrades, particularly those of the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit. Four of the planes assigned to the 393d Bombardment Squadron (now part of the 509th Composite Group) were transferred to the 216th to meet an increase in its testing tempo. Rather than attempt to modify the existing aircraft a <b>few</b> <b>at</b> a time, {{a decision was made}} to start a new production series. The first five of this third increment, known as Project 98228-S, also went to the test unit. The order totaled an additional 28 aircraft, with delivery of 15 designated combat models for the 393d beginning in April. The final eight were not delivered until after the two atomic bomb missions in August. Two were given to the 216th while the remaining six were assigned to the 509th at Wendover as replacements for any bombers lost while operating from Tinian. Ironically, no bombers were lost during operations from Tinian, but five of these six were lost in crashes over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Few</b> <b>at</b> {{the time}} {{realized}} {{how important the}} issue would become, with {{the absence of a}} bill of rights becoming the main argument of the anti-Federalists against ratification. Most of the Convention's delegates thought that states already protected individual rights, and that the Constitution did not authorize the national government to take away rights, so {{there was no need to}} include protections of rights. Once the Convention moved beyond this point, the delegates addressed a couple of last-minute issues. Importantly, they modified the language that required spending bills to originate in the House of Representatives and be flatly accepted or rejected, unmodified, by the Senate. The new language empowered the Senate to modify spending bills proposed by the House.|$|E

25|$|A central anti-copyright {{argument}} is that copyright is not beneficial to society and instead serves to enrich a <b>few</b> <b>at</b> the expense of creativity and widespread accessibility of works. The classic argument for copyright is that granting creators temporary monopolies over works—giving them an income will encourage producing future works as well.|$|E
25|$|The global alarm over {{radioactive}} fallout, {{which began}} with the Castle Bravo event, eventually drove nuclear testing literally underground. The last U.S. above-ground test took place at Johnston Island on November 4, 1962. During the next three decades, until September 23, 1992, the United States conducted an average of 2.4 underground nuclear explosions per month, all but a <b>few</b> <b>at</b> the Nevada Test Site (NTS) northwest of Las Vegas.|$|E

25|$|An issue arose as {{to whether}} the Admiralty should retain control of {{warehouses}} at Gibraltar, which were then underused. Tryon reported that in the event of war, stores immediately available at Gibraltar might be vitally important to the fleet, and that at such a time it would be virtually impossible to get back storage space relinquished in peace time. He was one of the <b>few</b> <b>at</b> that time to recognise the port's strategic significance for the fleet.|$|E
25|$|After Net/1, BSD {{developer}} Keith Bostic {{proposed that}} more non-AT {{sections of the}} BSD system be released under the same license as Net/1. To this end, he started a project to reimplement most of the standard Unix utilities without using the AT code. Within eighteen months, all of the AT utilities had been replaced, and {{it was determined that}} only a <b>few</b> <b>AT</b> files remained in the kernel. These files were removed, and the result was the June 1991 release of Networking Release 2 (Net/2), a nearly complete operating system that was freely distributable.|$|E
25|$|During World War I, Eddington was Secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society, {{which meant}} {{he was the first}} to receive a series of letters and papers from Willem de Sitter {{regarding}} Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Eddington was fortunate in being not only one of the few astronomers with the mathematical skills to understand general relativity, but owing to his internationalist and pacifist views inspired by his Quaker religious beliefs, one of the <b>few</b> <b>at</b> the time who was still interested in pursuing a theory developed by a German physicist. He quickly became the chief supporter and expositor of relativity in Britain. He and Astronomer Royal Frank Watson Dyson organized two expeditions to observe a solar eclipse in 1919 to make the first empirical test of Einstein’s theory: the measurement of the deflection of light by the sun's gravitational field. In fact, Dyson’s argument for the indispensability of Eddington’s expertise in this test was what prevented Eddington from eventually having to enter military service.|$|E

25|$|By February 2003, {{only five}} of the trains were in operation. Four were being used on the Jæren Commuter Rail, while one was being used on the line between Moss and Spikkestad. A few were still in Italy, a <b>few</b> <b>at</b> the docks in Drammen, {{while most of the}} trains were stored at Sundland in Drammen where AnsaldoBreda had {{employed}} 40 Italian engineers who worked 60-hour shifts to make the trains work. At the time they were finishing one train per month. By June, all seven trains had been taken into use in Jæren, and the first four trains could be put into service on the route from Kongsberg via the Gardermoen Line to Eidsvoll. In January 2004, rust was found on the axles of the trains. NSB would not accept to take delivery of the last 18 units before this problem had been fixed, and stated that no more money would be paid to the manufacturer until all 36 trains were delivered and without defects. By 2004, Ansaldo and Breda had merged to AnsaldoBreda, while SLM had been bought by Bombardier Transportation. The latter would not deliver the axles to AnsaldoBreda because of a disagreement between Bombardier and SLM's previous owner, Sulzer, regarding who was to pay for the axles. This caused Bombardier to cease all work with the delivery from mid-2003. In October 2004, the trains were put into service on the route between Moss and Spikkestad.|$|E

500|$|The {{years after}} the Dartmouth conference were an era of discovery, of sprinting across new ground.

Researchers expressed an intense optimism in private and in print, predicting that a fully intelligent machine would be built in less than 20 years. Government agencies like DARPA poured money into the new field.|$|E
500|$|When the U.S. entered World War I on {{the side}} of the Allies on 6 April 1917, the war at sea was hanging in the balance. Having [...] in February 1917, Germany had quickly inflicted {{staggering}} losses on the British merchant marine to an extent completely unknown to the American government, or indeed to anyone but a select <b>few</b> <b>at</b> the British Admiralty. At the first meeting between representatives of the two navies in April 1917, the British First Sea Lord—Admiral Sir John Jellicoe—had astonished the new American naval envoy—Rear Admiral William S. Sims—by informing him that Allied shipping loses had recently surpassed [...] per month, and that the Admiralty did not see any immediate solution to the problem.|$|E
500|$|He was {{primarily}} a starter in the outfield {{for the first half}} of the season, and during the second half he split time in right field with Hank Edwards. Clark finished the year having played 81 games, most in the outfield and a <b>few</b> <b>at</b> third base, and hit [...]310 with nine home runs and 38 RBIs. The Indians tied with the Boston Red Sox that season and had to play a tie-breaker to earn the right to play in the 1948 World Series. In that game, Indians manager Lou Boudreau placed Clark at first base, the first time he had played that position at any level. Clark then played in one game in the World Series, going hitless in four plate appearances as the Indians won the series.|$|E

But they are the same kind of human evils that have emerged from century to century wherever excessive power is sought by the <b>few</b> <b>at</b> the expense of the many. In my judgment the people of no nation can lose their liberty so long as a Bill of Rights like ours survives and its basic purposes are conscientiously interpreted, enforced, and respected... I would follow what I believe was the original intention of the Fourteenth Amendment—to extend to all the people the complete protection of the Bill of Rights. To hold that this Court can determine what, if any, provisions of the Bill of Rights will be enforced, and if so to what degree, is to frustrate the great design of a written Constitution.|$|E
500|$|Simon {{described}} {{the second season}} as [...] "a meditation {{on the death of}} work and the betrayal of the American working class... it is a deliberate argument that unencumbered capitalism is not a substitute for social policy; that on its own, without a social compact, raw capitalism is destined to serve the <b>few</b> <b>at</b> the expense of the many." [...] He added that season 3 [...] "reflects on the nature of reform and reformers, and whether there is any possibility that political processes, long calcified, can mitigate against the forces currently arrayed against individuals." [...] The third season is also an allegory that draws explicit parallels between the Iraq War and drug prohibition, which in Simon's view has failed in its aims and has become a war against America's underclass. This is portrayed by Major Colvin, imparting to Carver his view that policing has been allowed to become a war and thus will never succeed in its aims.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of his death, Darwin had {{convinced}} most scientists that evolution as descent with modification was correct, and he was regarded as a great scientist who had revolutionised ideas. In June 1909, though <b>few</b> <b>at</b> that time agreed with his view that [...] "natural selection has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification", he was honoured by more than 400 officials and scientists from across the world who met in Cambridge to commemorate his centenary and the fiftieth anniversary of On the Origin of Species. Around the beginning of the 20th century, a period that has been called [...] "the eclipse of Darwinism", scientists proposed various alternative evolutionary mechanisms, which eventually proved untenable. Ronald Fisher, an English statistician, finally united Mendelian genetics with natural selection, in the period between 1918 and his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection. He gave the theory a mathematical footing and brought broad scientific consensus that natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution, thus founding the basis for population genetics and the modern evolutionary synthesis, with J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, which set the frame of reference for modern debates and refinements of the theory.|$|E
