5|$|On 10 March, Pułaski {{departed}} Marseille on {{the first}} of three voyages from that port. She sailed to Algiers and from there to <b>Dakar</b> on 13 March. Pułaski left <b>Dakar</b> for Freetown, Sierra Leone, and Konakry, French Guinea, returning to <b>Dakar</b> in early April. Sailing for Marseille on 5 April, the ship returned on 13 April as a part of convoy DF 29. Leaving again about two weeks later, she repeated the trip and returned to Marseille on 29 May as a part of convoy DF 41. By the time of her return, the German invasion of France had been underway for nearly three weeks.|$|E
5|$|On 14 September 1955, the Apostolic Vicariate of <b>Dakar</b> {{became an}} archdiocese, and Lefebvre thus {{became the first}} Metropolitan Archbishop of <b>Dakar.</b> Archbishop Lefebvre {{was the first and}} {{foremost}} advisor to Pius XII during the writing of the encyclical Fidei Donum (1957), which instructed the clergy and laity on the missions in the Third World countries and called for more missionaries.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in <b>Dakar</b> on 26 August, the DNOG was tasked with patrolling a triangle with corners at <b>Dakar,</b> Cape Verde and Gibraltar; the Allies {{believed that this}} area was rife with U-boats waiting for convoys to pass through. As such, the Brazilian unit's mission was to patrol for mines laid by German minelaying submarines {{and to make sure}} that convoys passing through would be safe. Complications arose when both Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul had problems with their condensers, a matter which was made much worse by the hot, tropical climate in which the ships were serving.|$|E
5|$|Fossett raced cars in {{the mid-1970s}} and later {{returned}} to the sport in the 1990s. He competed in the 24 hours of Le Mans road race in 1993 and in 1996, along with the Paris to <b>Dakar</b> Rally.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Pope Pius XII {{died and}} was succeeded by Pope John XXIII, who, in 1959, after giving Lefebvre {{the choice between}} {{remaining}} either as Apostolic Delegate or as Archbishop of <b>Dakar,</b> appointed another to the post of Apostolic Delegate for French Africa. Lefebvre continued as Archbishop of <b>Dakar</b> until 23 January 1962, when he {{was transferred to the}} diocese of Tulle in France, retaining his personal title of archbishop. Shortly after his appointment as Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers (see below), he resigned from the diocese of Tulle on 7 August, 1962.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{the group}} {{performed}} at a music festival {{held by the}} <b>Dakar</b> French Cultural Center, where the French rapper MC Solaar heard their performance and invited the group to open {{for him when he}} debuted in <b>Dakar</b> in October of that year. The rapper was impressed with Positive Black Soul, inviting them to continue performing with him in France. Two years later the group put out its first release, a cassette entitled Boul Falé. The album was followed by more touring in France, as well as in England and Switzerland. In the same year, the Senegalese musician Baaba Maal offered PBS the opportunity to be on his album Firin' in Fouta. Maal was signed to Mango Records and because of this recording with him, Positive Black Soul were signed as well. They released their album debut Salaam on Mango Records. After achieving success in Senegal and some abroad, the group continued touring, including 130 performances in 1997. They also began organizing concerts in <b>Dakar</b> and promoting new groups including Daara J and Pee Froiss.|$|E
5|$|N'Diaye {{was born}} in <b>Dakar,</b> Senegal to Seynabou and Mbad N'Diaye. He has an older brother, named Adam. He grew up playing soccer and did not seriously begin playing {{basketball}} at a young age. In 2010, Amadou Koundoul, who was the assistant coach for the UC Irvine Anteaters men's basketball team at the time, saw N'Diaye participate in a pick-up game in a gymnasium at <b>Dakar.</b> He asked him {{to travel to the}} United States, and N'Diaye accepted the offer. He arrived in the US without knowing how to speak English. In the new country, he initially had trouble with speaking English and often needed things to be translated to French.|$|E
5|$|While {{forced into}} exile {{and with his}} forces {{confined}} to the frontier zones of Darfur, Habré remained defiant. On 31 December he announced in <b>Dakar</b> he would resume fighting as a guerrilla against the GUNT.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, {{just before}} the {{outbreak}} of , Carabane suffered a fire which caused its business to decline. People gradually left the island in search of work in Ziguinchor and even <b>Dakar.</b> In December 1915, Marcel de Coppet, administrator of Ziguinchor, visited the island in order to recruit tirailleurs. Six inhabitants of the island accepted the position: a Christian, a pagan, and four Muslims.|$|E

5|$|Since about 2002, the group's {{members have}} been {{pursuing}} solo projects. On August 14, 2009, PBS performed in <b>Dakar</b> for their 20th anniversary effectively ending speculations about whether they have disbanded. Guests at the concert included powerful Senegal music stars such as Youssou Ndour and Ismael Lo.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa near <b>Dakar,</b> Senegal on September22. The wave traveled westward with minimal tropical cyclogenesis and reached the Lesser Antilles about a week later. While passing through the islands, heavy rainfall and strong winds were reported. Eventually, the system developed into a broad area of low pressure and acquired a low-level circulation. However, upper-level wind shear resulted in no immediate further organization. After crossing Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, wind shear decreased, since the low was moving {{in the same direction as}} the upper-level winds.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Provence was in Toulon along with Bretagne in the 2nd Squadron, with Provence serving as the flagship of Vice Admiral Ollive. On 21 October, she went into drydock for periodic maintenance, which lasted until 2 December. Two days later, Provence and Bretagne, along with numerous cruisers and destroyers, sortied from <b>Dakar</b> to cover French merchant shipping off West Africa and the Azores. Around {{the middle of the}} month, the French warships returned to port.|$|E
5|$|Carabane {{has many}} {{historic}} sites, {{such as the}} Catholic mission house built in 1880 which has since {{been turned into a}} hotel, a Brittany-style church building which is no longer in use, and a former slave-trade building. There is also a French cemetery where a Troupes de marine-Captain with the name Aristide Protet was shot with a poisoned arrow and buried standing {{up in front of the}} sea, according to his last wishes. Some tour guides falsely claim that this was Auguste Léopold Protet, the founder of the city of <b>Dakar,</b> but the name Aristide Protet is clearly shown on the tomb's plaque.|$|E
5|$|Falke {{departed}} Montevideo {{and crossed}} the Atlantic to <b>Dakar,</b> proceeding to Las Palmas and then Lisbon. There she was visited by Frederick Augustus III of Saxony. She arrived in Danzig on 15 April, after {{five and a half}} years abroad. The ship was decommissioned on 20 January, and an evaluation determined that she was not worth overhauling. She was accordingly stricken from the naval register on 25 October 1912 and broken up the following year at the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig.|$|E
5|$|Lefebvre's {{return to}} France {{was not to}} last long. On 12 June 1947, Pope Pius XII {{appointed}} him Vicar Apostolic of <b>Dakar</b> in Senegal; he received the titular episcopal see of Anthedon (El Blakiyeh near Gaza in Palestine). On 18 September 1947 he was consecrated a bishop in his family's parish church in Tourcoing by Achille Liénart (who had previously ordained him a priest); acting as co-consecrators were Bishop Jean-Baptiste Fauret, C.S.Sp. and Bishop Alfred-Jean-Félix Ancel.|$|E
5|$|Northumberland was {{assigned}} to the 1st Reserve Squadron at the Isle of Portland in 1890–91 and then at Devonport from 1891–98. She was hulked in 1898 as a stokers' training ship at the Nore and renamed Acheron on the 1st of January 1904. From 1909–27 the ship served as a coal hulk at Invergordon, renamed C.8 in 1909 and then C.68 in 1926. The ship was sold in 1927, but was then resold and renamed as Stedmound for service at <b>Dakar</b> until she was scrapped in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Positive Black Soul (also {{known as}} PBS) is a hip hop {{group based in}} <b>Dakar,</b> Senegal, {{one of the first}} such collectives in the country. Founded in 1989, the group is {{composed}} of Didier Sourou Awadi (alias DJ Awadi) and Amadou Barry (alias Doug E. Tee or Duggy-Tee), both of whom had previously been in other hip hop groups. They perform in the English, French, and Wolof languages and use traditional Senegalese instruments as part of their songs. Political and social activism have played important roles in the group since it was founded.|$|E
5|$|Pułaski sailed on {{her third}} and final French voyage on 6 June. The liner arrived at <b>Dakar</b> on 15 June, and sailed the next day for Freetown, where she arrived on 18 June. Likely because of the {{confusion}} surrounding the French surrender on 22 June, Pułaskis movements over the next days are unrecorded, but she was detained at Konakry on 8 July by Vichy authorities. That evening, Pułaskis crew raised steam and sailed the ship out of the harbor {{in defiance of the}} detainment. After taking fire from shore batteries at Konakry, the ship arrived back at Freetown on 9 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{considerable}} Belgian gold reserves, {{on which}} the Belga had been secured, were mostly transported to Britain, Canada and the United States before the German invasion. Over 198 tonnes, however, had been entrusted to the Banque de France before the war, and shipped to <b>Dakar</b> in French West Africa. Under the pro-German Vichy régime, the gold was seized by the Germans, who used it to buy munitions from neutral Switzerland and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} to Hurricane Donna brought severe weather to the <b>Dakar</b> area of Senegal. Air France Flight AF343, which was flying from Paris, France to Abidjan, Ivory Coast, attempted {{to land at}} the Léopold Sédar Senghor International Airport as a layover. However, due to squally weather, the plane instead crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 63people on board. Heavy rainfall was also reported in Cape Verde on August30.|$|E
5|$|Vergniaud {{was based}} in Beirut from May to August 1919 to monitor Turkish {{activities}} off the coasts of Palestine, Lebanon and Syria. She arrived in Toulon on 6 September and was placed in special reserve on 1 October. This ship was later found to be in poor shape, decommissioned in June 1921 and condemned on 27 October. She was disarmed in 1922 and her 240mm guns handed over for coastal defence, nine being installed around <b>Dakar,</b> some still existing there.|$|E
5|$|With the RUF rapidly {{advancing}} on Freetown {{and controlling}} {{most of the}} interior of Sierra Leone, {{the only means of}} rapidly evacuating entitled persons or reinforcing UNAMSIL was by air via Lungi airport. Thus, the enhanced 1 PARA was flown to <b>Dakar</b> on 7 May, where C Company and the special forces squadron were almost immediately put aboard RAF Hercules C-130s with orders to secure the airport. They arrived at Lungi before sunset and were joined by the remaining elements of 1 PARA the next morning. The soldiers were able to deploy rapidly and with minimal equipment, knowing that they would not have to wait long for the ARG's reinforcements and supplies should they be needed. The soldiers immediately set about securing the areas that would be vital to an evacuation, including the Mamy Yoko hotel, which became the evacuation centre, and Lungi airport. Jones requested in the afternoon of 8 May that Richards commence the evacuation—codenamed Operation Palliser—which Richards did almost immediately. Entitled persons who wished to leave were instructed to assemble at the Mamy Yoko hotel. From there, they would be helicoptered to the airport by Chinooks and then flown to <b>Dakar.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{disturbance}} {{associated with}} the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) left the coast of West Africa on August 9, producing mid-level winds of 75mph (120km/h) in <b>Dakar,</b> Senegal. A weak circulation formed near the sea surface on August10 within an area of thunderstorms. The disturbance moved slowly westward over the Atlantic Ocean, developing into a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on August12, around the 10th parallel north, an unusually southern latitude the cyclone would remain around throughout its lifetime. On August13, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alma about 375mi (605km) east of Trinidad and Tobago, as indicated by a Hurricane Hunters flight reporting winds of 65mph (105km/h). This same flight observed a circular eye with a diameter of , the only report of an eye-like structure from this storm.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} west coast of Africa near <b>Dakar,</b> Senegal on September7. Moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean, the wave spawned an area of convection three days later, which gradually organized. On September13, the wave moved through the Windward Islands, producing wind gusts of 50mph (85km/h) on Barbados. Later that day, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression about 75mi (120km) west-northwest of Trinidad, based on ship and land reports. Though located in a climatologically unfavorable area, the depression intensified and continued to develop. A Hurricane Hunters flight on September14 indicated that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Greta {{to the north of the}} Netherlands Antilles.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa near <b>Dakar</b> on August 31. It moved westward into the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and organized into a tropical disturbance on September 2 with a small, circular area of convection. The system moved to the west, and on September 3, the convection diminished after moving west of 40° W. By the next day, the tropical disturbance was barely discernible from the clouds of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The wave gradually became detached from the ITCZ, and based on a reconnaissance flight that confirmed the existence of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on September 5 while located 255 miles (415 km) east of Grenada.|$|E
5|$|Caio Duilios first wartime patrol {{took place}} on 31 August. She {{and the rest of}} the fleet sailed to {{intercept}} the British battleship , which was steaming to Alexandria, and a convoy sailing to Malta. The Italian fleet did not have sufficient aerial reconnaissance, which, along with bad weather, prevented the Italians from locating the British forces. They put back in to Taranto on 1 September. Caio Duilio again put to sea on 7 September, in an attempt to catch the British Force H, but the Italian intelligence was faulty, as Force H was in the process of attacking <b>Dakar.</b> Caio Duilio returned to Taranto, where she remained until early November.|$|E
5|$|HMS Bridgewater (L01) was {{the lead}} ship of her class of sloops built for the Royal Navy in the 1920s. Completed in 1929, the ship was {{initially}} assigned to the China Station and {{was transferred to the}} Africa Station in 1935. During the Second World War, Bridgewater spent most of her time on convoy escort duties off the West African coast although she did play a minor role in the Battle of <b>Dakar</b> in 1940. She was replaced in that role {{before the end of the}} war by more modern ships and was relegated to training duties in the UK. The ship was reduced to reserve shortly after the end of the war and was sold for scrap in 1947.|$|E
5|$|HMS Encounter was an E-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion, the ship {{was attached to the}} Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–36 during the Abyssinia Crisis. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39, she spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France {{on both sides of the}} conflict. Encounter was assigned to convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol duties in the Western Approaches, when World War II began in September 1939.

The ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1941 where she escorted convoys to Malta.|$|E
5|$|HMS Forester {{was one of}} nine F-class destroyers {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the early 1930s. Although {{assigned}} to the Home Fleet upon completion, the ship {{was attached to the}} Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–36 during the Abyssinia Crisis. A few weeks after the start of World War II in September 1939, she helped to sink one German submarine and then participated in the Second Battle of Narvik during the Norwegian Campaign of 1940. Forester was sent to Gibraltar in mid-1940 and formed part of Force H where she participated in the attack on the Vichy French ships at Mers-el-Kébir and the Battle of <b>Dakar</b> between escorting the aircraft carriers of Force H as they flew off aircraft for Malta and covering convoys resupplying and reinforcing the island until late 1941. During this time the ship helped to sink another German submarine.|$|E
5|$|HMS Fury was an F-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the 1930s. Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion, the ship {{was attached to the}} Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–36 during the Abyssinia Crisis.

Fury was sent to Gibraltar in mid-1940 and formed part of Force H where she participated in the attack on Mers-el-Kébir and the Battle of <b>Dakar.</b> The ship escorted numerous convoys to Malta in 1940–41 and Arctic convoys during 1942.|$|E
5|$|HMS Greyhound was a G-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the 1930s. Greyhound participated in the Norwegian Campaign in April 1940, the Dunkirk evacuation in May and the Battle of <b>Dakar</b> in September before being transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in November. The ship generally escorted the larger ships of the Mediterranean Fleet as they protected convoys against attacks from the Italian Fleet. She sank two Italian submarines while escorting convoys herself in early 1941. Greyhound was sunk by German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers north-west of Crete on 22 May 1941 as she escorted the battleships of the Mediterranean Fleet attempting to intercept the German sea-borne invasion forces destined for Crete.|$|E
5|$|HMS Griffin (H31) was a G-class destroyer, {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. In World War II she {{took part in the}} Norwegian Campaign of April–May 1940 and the Battle of <b>Dakar</b> in September before being {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean Fleet in November.

In June she took part in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign and was escorting convoys and the larger ships of the Mediterranean Fleet until she was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in March 1942.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny was {{determined}} to stop the hegemony of Senegal in West Africa and a political confrontation ensued between Ivorian and Senegalese leaders. Houphouët-Boigny refused {{to participate in the}} Inter-African conference in <b>Dakar</b> on 31 December 1958, which was intended to lay the foundation for the Federation of Francophone African States. Although that federation was never realised, Senegal and Mali (known at the time as French Sudan) formed their own political union, the Mali Federation. After de Gaulle allowed the Mali Federation independence in 1959, Houphouët-Boigny tried to sabotage the federation's efforts to wield political control; in cooperation with France, he managed to convince Upper Volta, Dahomey, and Niger to withdraw from the Mali Federation, before it collapsed in August 1960.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 and 1989, Mouton {{participated in}} rally raids {{as part of}} Peugeot's service team for Ari Vatanen and Jacky Ickx. At the 1988 Rally of Tunisia, Mouton drove a 205 T16 Grand Raid chase car and transported spare parts for Vatanen and Henri Pescarolo, but also {{classified}} sixth overall. She later {{took part in the}} <b>Dakar</b> Rally as a press driver in 2004 and 2009. In 2000, Mouton finished second in the London–Sydney Marathon driving a Porsche 911, behind former teammate Stig Blomqvist. After 22 years, Mouton and Fabrizia Pons reunited to compete in the 2008 Otago Classic Rally in New Zealand. In 2010, Mouton competed with a 911 in the Rallye du Maroc and finished second to Grégoire De Mévius.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Great War, the Roman Catholic Church encountered great difficulties in the region. There was insufficient staffing, the cost of living was rising, and the harsh climate began to wear on the buildings. In 1920, the diocese had, in addition to Carabane, thirteen churches and approximately thirty-five chapels. The thirteen churches were located in <b>Dakar,</b> Saint-Louis, Gorée, Rufisque, Thiès, Ngazobil, Joal, Fadiouth, Foundiougne, Kaolack, Ziguinchor, Bignona and Banjul. In 1922, the Governor decreed which buildings were authorized to practise Catholicism. While the Carabane church was one of the buildings selected, some members blamed the colonial administration for having facilitated the expansion of Islam in the country.|$|E
