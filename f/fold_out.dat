5|$|By 6:30am {{the fire}} was {{spreading}} very quickly through the building, although from the outside nothing was visible. Because of the wooden construction, the building was soon engulfed in flames. The guests on the top level could not escape and stood panicked in the windows. When the fire reached the rooms of some guests, they leaped out of the windows to escape. At 6:42 the first large fire engine arrived. On the street there lay several dead and injured people, who had jumped from their hotel room windows. On the lower floor, the furniture store Inden was also on fire. The fire fighters tried to <b>fold</b> <b>out</b> a life net in the Papenbroekssteeg (which runs between the Rokin and the Kalverstraat) but the alley was too narrow for it.|$|E

25|$|PA is endocytosed as a soluble heptamer {{attached}} to its receptors, with LF or EF {{attached to}} the heptamer as cargo. The first step after endocytosis is the acidification of the endocytotic vesicle. The acidification plays two roles in the lifespan of the toxin. First, it helps to relax the tight grip of the CMG2 or TEM8 receptor on PA, facilitating the pore formation (the different receptors allow for insertion at a slightly different pH). Second, the drop in pH causes a disordered loop and a Greek-key motif in the PA domain 2 to <b>fold</b> <b>out</b> of the heptamer pre-pore and insert through {{the wall of the}} acidic vesicle, leading to pore formation (Figures 7–9).|$|E
25|$|Amtrak's Superliner Economy Bedrooms (now called Superliner Roomettes, {{although}} they are structurally closer to open sections) accommodate two passengers in facing seats that <b>fold</b> <b>out</b> into a lower berth, with an upper berth that folds down from above, a small closet, and no in-room washbasin or toilet, {{on both sides of}} both the upper and lower levels of the car. Effectively, they are open sections with walls, a door, and a built-in access ladder for the upper berth (which doubles as a nightstand for the lower berth passenger). Superliner Deluxe Bedrooms are essentially the same as historic Compartments and Double Bedrooms, with the toilet cubicle doubling as a private shower cubicle. In addition, each Superliner sleeping car has two special lower-level accommodations, each taking up the full width of the car: the Accessible Bedroom, at the restroom/shower end of the car (below the Deluxe Bedrooms), is a fully wheelchair-accessible accommodation for two, with a roll-in cubicle for the toilet and shower; the Family Bedroom, at the Economy Bedroom end of the car, accommodates two adults and up to three small children, without private toilet or shower facilities.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} issued {{in a clear}} jewel box with a die-cut {{cardboard}} O-card. It included sixteen pages, which <b>fold</b> <b>out</b> to be a poster, which displays the cover art. Both the disc and the disc tray feature — as described by Chris Morris — an [...] "image reflective of the mania displayed by the group's fans, and exemplary of American frequently deployed shock tactics: a kid carving the band's name into his arms with a scalpel." [...] Mike Bone from American Recordings said that [...] "we captured this not only by photography, but with video — him actually doing it." [...] The front cover was painted and designed by Wes Benscoter, an American artist who would later paint the covers for the other Slayer releases Undisputed Attitude and Live Intrusion. The album sleeve features {{for the second time}} the backronym Satan Laughs As You Eternally Rot. This phrase was first used on the vinyl edition of the album Show No Mercy where it was carved into the runout groove of the record.|$|E
500|$|Thơ and {{the leading}} generals in the MRC {{also had a}} secret plan to end the {{communist}} insurgency, which called itself the National Liberation Front (NLF) and claimed to be independent of the communist government of North Vietnam. They claimed {{that most of them}} were first and foremost southern nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention and U.S. involvement and support of Diệm. The MRC and Thơ thought that an agreement to end the war within South Vietnam was possible. Thơ recalled in later years that his government's plan was to generate support among the Cao Đài, Hòa Hảo and ethnic Cambodian minorities, elements of which were in the NLF and bring them back into the mainstream <b>fold</b> <b>out</b> of the insurgency into a non-communist pro-West political system. He thought {{that it was possible to}} sideline the communists as he described them as [...] "still having no dominance and only a minor position" [...] within the NLF. According to Thơ, this plan was not a deal with the communists or the NLF as his group saw it as a political attempt to coax back non-communist dissidents and isolate those that were communists.|$|E
500|$|Norwich {{was among}} the last of Lutyens' {{memorials}} to be built. Many towns and cities built memorials soon {{after the end of}} the First World War, but early [...] attempts in Norwich proved abortive, each mired in controversy. A scheme to build an agricultural college to serve as a memorial reached the point of soliciting donations, but these had to be returned when the scheme was abandoned as being too ambitious and not appealing to all social classes. When Charles Bignold was elected Lord Mayor of Norwich in 1926, he was determined that the city would have a war memorial before he left office. He took the initiative and commissioned Lutyens and the two men selected a site to the east of the Guildhall when the architect visited the city on 13 June 1927. Adamant that the project should benefit the living as well as provide a monument to the dead, Bignold established the Joint Hospitals and War Memorial Appeal to raise funds for the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital and the Jenny Lind Children's Hospital, as well as a physical monument. The target was £35,000, of which £4,000 was to be allocated to a memorial. The memorial would not have space for the names of Norwich's 3,544 war dead, so Lutyens was also commissioned to design the Norwich Roll of Honour. An further £800–£1,000 was allocated and Lutyens produced a set of oak panels which <b>fold</b> <b>out</b> to reveal the names painted on the inside.|$|E

2500|$|Often called [...] "sleepers" [...] or [...] "Pullman cars" [...] (after {{the main}} American operator), these cars provide {{sleeping}} arrangements for passengers travelling at night.

More modern interiors are normally partitioned into separate bedroom compartments for passengers.

2500|$|Mid year 1968 saw the {{official}} {{introduction of the}} California GS, and it is frequently known as a '69 model. Buick asked [...] "Why settle for less when the California GS, built especially for YOU, costs no more?" [...] Exclusively designed for Golden State motorists, Buick advertised the car nationally as a high performance family sports car at an economy car price. Though the car {{was not included in}} Buick's yearly catalog it was shown in a two-page black and white <b>fold</b> <b>out</b> brochure. Custom California GS emblems again graced the rear fenders while GS ornamentation could be found in the grille and sail panels. The drivetrain included Buick's new for '68 350-4 V8 with 10.25:1 compression and Rochester (GM) 4GC Quadrajet four-barrel (four-choke) carburetor, producing 280hp and 375lb·ft of torque. The two-speed Super Turbine 300 transmission (driving a 3.23:1 rear axle gear, designed for highway cruising) and bench seat interior were again the only choices. Buick also added chrome plated wheels and air cleaner lid to the two-door thin pillar coupe. Tires were [...] on [...] rims.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{approach}} is to embed the higher-dimensional objects in three-dimensional space, using methods analogous {{to the ways in}} which three-dimensional objects are drawn on the plane. For example, the <b>fold</b> <b>out</b> nets mentioned in the previous section have higher-dimensional equivalents. Some of these may be viewed at [...] One might even imagine building a model of this fold-out net, as one draws a polyhedron's fold-out net on a piece of paper. Sadly, we could never do the necessary folding of the 3-dimensional structure to obtain the 4-dimensional polytope because of the constraints of the physical universe. Another way to [...] "draw" [...] the higher-dimensional shapes in 3 dimensions is via some kind of projection, for example, the analogue of either orthographic or perspective projection. Coxeter's famous book on polytopes (Coxeter, 1948) has some examples of such orthographic projections. Other examples may be found on the web (see for example [...] ). Note that immersing even 4-dimensional polychora directly into two dimensions is quite confusing. Easier to understand are 3-d models of the projections. Such models are occasionally found in science museums or mathematics departments of universities (such as that of the Université Libre de Bruxelles).|$|E
2500|$|Reichelt {{was born}} in Wegstädtl, Austrian Empire (today, Štětí, Czech Republic) in 1879 and moved to Paris in 1898. He {{obtained}} French nationality in 1909, adopting the first name François (the French equivalent of the Germanic [...] "Franz"). One of his sisters may have also come to France and been married to a jeweller there, but newspaper reports differed {{on the details of}} his family life, with most reporting that his sisters stayed in Vienna. Reichelt himself was unmarried. He took an apartment on the third floor at 8 rue Gaillon near the Avenue de l'Opera from 1907 (which he rented for 1500 francs a year) and opened what was to become a successful dressmaking business, catering mostly to Austrians on trips to Paris. From July 1910, he began to develop a [...] "parachute-suit": a suit that was not much more bulky than one normally worn by an aviator, but {{with the addition of a}} few rods, a silk canopy and a small amount of rubber that allowed it to <b>fold</b> <b>out</b> to become what Reichelt hoped would be a practical and efficient parachute.|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{cover was}} {{unveiled}} on July 8, 2010 {{and met with}} positive reception.

[...] Ciara then outlined plans for a mixtape to precede the album's release, in preparation she recorded remixes to Soulja Boy Tell 'Em's [...] "Pretty Boy Swag" [...] ("Pretty Girl Swag") and Waka Flocka Flame's [...] "Hard in Da Paint", {{as well as a}} cover of Young Jeezy's [...] "Lose My Mind". When asked by Gerrick D. Kennedy. from the Los Angeles Times, if the label [...] {{had anything to do with}} the delays in release or late promotion, Ciara replied [...] "I did see a few comments and I said, 'You know what? I one day look forward to being able to share with my fans (things that happen).' Right now, this is about living in a world of possibility and doing my best, [...]. Getting the record out there, I just want my fans to hear it. This album is really for my fans, and it's good to know the energy and the feedback has been great. It really is just the beginning". In February 2011, following rumors that Ciara had been dropped by Jive Records, Ciara released an official statement to her Facebook page. Amongst her complaints, were a lack of funding and support from the label with regards to promoting Basic Instinct. In addition to disagreeing with the label over single choices, Ciara personally funded the $100,000 video for her third single [...] "Gimmie Dat". [...] "I'm dedicated to my music, performance and to my fans! I've tried to be a team player with the label only to have compromised what I truly believed..
