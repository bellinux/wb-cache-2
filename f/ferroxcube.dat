40|$|International audienceIn this paper, planar {{printed-circuit board}} (PCB) {{transformers}} with different winding arrangements are presented. Three different arrangements {{of the primary}} and the secondary meander-type windings are designed and fabricated. The electrical parameters of the transformers for all three designs are analyzed and compared. A significant increase of inductance of the primary and the secondary winding is achieved with an appropriate meander-type winding arrangement. In the frequency range of interest, the inductance is approximately 145 nH for the first design, whereas the inductance is approximately 1250 nH for the second and the third design. The coupling coefficient is 0. 14 for the first design, whereas it is around 0. 9 for the second and the third design. The transformer of the proposed design {{is to be used}} in low-power DC/DC converters; therefore, the core with high permeability <b>Ferroxcube</b> 3 C 90 was chosen. In addition, the transformers of the same winding arrangements were tested with <b>Ferroxcube</b> 3 F 3 core...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a steady}} demand to {{increase}} the efficiency and raise the power density of power converters. This trend is desired since it leads to reduced size of the converter. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate materials, topologies, core structure and then build a prototype to demonstrate the result. Two core materials have been compared, Fair-Rite material 68 and <b>Ferroxcube</b> 4 F 1. The goal was to have 50 V input and 30 V output with 80 % efficiency of the converter. The converter with the Fair-Rite material 68 accomplished a peak efficiency at 11 MHz with 54 % efficiency. The core material <b>Ferroxcube</b> 4 F 1, reached an efficiency of 52 % at 7 MHz. These results were however with 5 V input and 3 V output. The converter had a low efficiency at 50 V input, which lead to ripple in the circuit. One reason for this behaviour was because the design of the PCB was not optimized for MHz operation. The focus of the PCB was that it should be easy to work with instead of achieving peak performance. Also, from the beginning it was decided that no PCB should be made. The focus was instead on the theory and simulations of the converter so no thoroughly investigation of PCB design was done. The leakage inductance of the transformer core was about 10 % of the primary inductance for both materials. The high leakage inductance is believed to further reduce the efficiency of the converter...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of the {{magnetic}} characteristics of the <b>Ferroxcube</b> 8 C 12 m ferrite material in the parameter range where the GSI heavy-ion synchrotron SIS 18 cavity resonator is operated are presented. At first, the permeability is determined {{as a function of}} frequency and bias magnetic field strength for low radio-frequency power levels. For this purpose, both reflection and transmission measurements are carried out in a test setup with two toroids. The values for the real and imaginary part obtained from the data analysis of both approaches are fully in agreement with each other, albeit the range of application of the latter setup is limited to moderate frequencies due to parasitic resonances. An empirical analytical expression is formulated which approximates the complex permeability reasonably well in the whole investigated bias and frequency range. Moreover, the B-H curve is recorded for a reduced bias current range of the cavity. The gained material characteristics are well suited for numerical eigenmode simulations for the GSI SIS 18 cavity...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The GALAXY {{computer}} is a large, high speed, general purpose, digital computer {{intended to be}} used for solving scientific problems. It requires a random access memory system of 16, 384 words of 59 bits each with a cycle time of one microsecond or less. A memory system capable of meeting these requirements has been designed for ferrite core storage elements and transistor active elements. It consists of four sections of 4, 096 words each, with the initial installation consisting of two sections. Each section has its own associated current drivers and sense amplifiers while the memory register, decode circuits, and timing unit are used in common by the whole system. An experimental investigation of the memory system gave evidence that the requirements could be met by using presently available commercial components. A linear selection system was selected and investigated by using a 64 core word line and a 4, 096 sense line to simulate a core stack. The experimental results showed that a minimum cycle time of 700 nanoseconds could be obtained. The results of an investigation of the system com ponents were used to select the type of cores and plane configuration. <b>Ferroxcube</b> type 6 F 2 cores were used with a word line configuration of two turns per core and a sense line configuration of one turn per core. Distri buted capacitance was added to the sense line to achieve a purely resistive characteristic impedance and thus sub stantially reduce the post-write disturb voltage. The investigation and design of the associated elec tronic circuits are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the {{numerical}} computation of complex eigenmodes of cavity resonators filled with magnetically biased gyrotropic material is demonstrated. For this purpose, a dedicated solver {{based on the}} Finite Integration Technique (FIT) has been developed, efficiently implemented as well as successfully verified. Gyrotropic field problems arise, for instance, for the calculation of the resonance frequencies of ferrite-loaded resonators like the GSI SIS 18 cavity. Ferrites exhibit gyromagnetic properties with an anisotropic permeability, which furthermore depends both on frequency and bias field. Similarly, gyroelectric material such as magnetized plasmas can be described by a frequency- and bias field dependent permittivity tensor. Since these material tensors affect the system matrix of the eigenvalue problem, a dedicated solver is required. In this thesis, the FIT with a hexaedral staircase filling is employed for discretization. In the standard formulation, it is, however, limited to diagonally anisotropic materials. Hence, {{as one of the}} goals of this thesis, the FIT has been extended to gyromagnetic as well as gyroelectric materials in frequency domain. The derived expressions for the non-diagonal material matrices are fully consistent with the standard FIT when applied to non-gyrotropic materials. Moreover, their structure is manifestly Hermitian in the lossless case, even for non-equidistant grids. Due to the above-mentioned material requirements, the newly developed solver consists of two components: The first one is a magnetostatic solver based on the H_i-algorithm supporting nonlinear material to calculate the magnetic field excited by the bias current. Having obtained the field distribution, the material properties are evaluated locally in each mesh cell at the specified working point. The second component is a Jacobi-Davidson type eigenvalue solver for the iterative solution of the nonlinear eigenproblem. To be capable of handling material losses, the eigensolver also supports non-Hermitian eigenproblems. What is more, efficient parallel computing on machines with distributed memory is possible. To this end, an ordering of the FIT-DOFs different from the standard scheme is implemented, which results in an increased computation to communication ratio. Furthermore, all DOFs that vanish a priori due to several reasons are completely removed from the vectors and matrices. All in all, gyrotropic eigenproblems discretized with several millions of mesh cells can be solved in a reasonable time by the developed solver. The validity of {{the numerical}}ly obtained results is confirmed by thorough comparisons with (semi-) analytical calculations. As an application example, an eigenmode analysis of the GSI SIS 18 cavity is carried out. Since the required material data are not available in the data sheet of the manufacturer, designated measurements of the magnetic characteristics of the <b>Ferroxcube</b> 8 C 12 m ferrite ring cores, which are installed inside the GSI SIS 18 cavities, were performed. Among these characteristics are the complex permeability as a function of frequency and bias magnetic field strength at low radio-frequency power levels as well as the B-H curve. The measurement methods together with the detailed data analysis including the presentation of evaluated data are supplemented to this thesis. The scalar, isotropic permeability retrieved this way is used for the cavity simulations. The obtained values for the resonance frequency and quality factor for the fundamental mode are in accordance with available measurement data. To demonstrate the further potential of the solver, also higher-order modes are investigated and an outlook on possibly advantageous 2 -directional bias schemes is given...|$|E
