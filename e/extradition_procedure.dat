40|$|This {{article focuses}} {{at the main}} {{problems}} regarding the current application of EU <b>extradition</b> <b>procedures</b> {{in relation to the}} area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. It introduces the ‘Europeanisation’ of <b>extradition</b> <b>procedures</b> through a discussion based on the continuity of the principle of mutual recognition from the EC Treaties to the EU Constitutional Treaty. The latest manifestation of this continuity is the introduction of the European Arrest Warrant (adopted on June 13, 20002) that is aimed to simplify the <b>extradition</b> <b>procedures</b> for suspected criminals within the territory of the European Union by creating a positive list of criminal areas. The author discusses the innovations introduced by the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant (abolition of the test of dual criminality) and then focuses on two main problem areas based on the reaction of certain Member States: i) Compatibility with Constitutional Guarantees: where the author notices a change of attitude in the national courts from being eager to contest the constitutionality of EU Arrest Warrant implementation law to being more pragmatic about authorising the extradition of their own nationals ii) Compatibility with Human Rights: where the author argues that the principle of mutual recognition is not adequate for adjudicating interstate criminal cases when it operates in isolation. He therefore proposes the enforcement of mutual trust or ‘full faith and credit’ accompanied by the standards of procedural rights set out in the ECHR and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights...|$|R

Framework decisions were legal instruments of the third pillar of the European Community akin to directives and only take effect when implemented by EU member states by transposing them into their domestic law. The European Arrest Warrant replaced the 1957 European Convention on Extradition (ECE) which had previously governed extraditions between most member states, and various legal instruments which had been adopted to streamline the process of extradition under the ECE such as the 1989 agreement on the simplification of the transmission requests for extradition, the 1995 Convention on simplified <b>extradition</b> <b>procedure,</b> the 1996 Convention on extradition between Member States, and {{the provisions of the}} Schengen Agreement regarding extradition.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{portrays the}} new European Union {{extradition}} system, {{established by the}} Framework Decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States of 2002.

The main author's standpoint is that the European arrest warrant is based on mutual trust in the member-states' legal systems, and that it depoliticizes the <b>extradition</b> <b>procedure</b> by transforming interstate cooperation into cooperation between member - states' law enforcement authorities. On these grounds, the author determines the nature of this new legal institute, that introduces radical changes into the paradigm of the classical extradition, and explains its main features as well as the scope of application. Further on, the paper explores the conditions for issuance of the European arrest warrant, which are proscribed by negative formulations - as absolute and relative obstacles for extradition. Finally, the author explains the standardized formal elements of the European arrest warrant content, which should make its application easier and more expeditious...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a very {{delicate}} subject – the extraordinary rendition. The analysis starts from the rendition to justice as a technique by which a suspected person is forcibly abducted in another State, if {{it is impossible to}} bring this suspect to stand trial by the normal <b>extradition</b> <b>procedure.</b> In these cases, the forcible abduction can be executed unilaterally by the agents of the forum State or with the cooperation of agents of the State where the person is abducted. The rendition in itself is not a judicial procedure because it lacks a judicial warrant and, in reality, is mostly a highly covert police or military operation, with the risk of infringing upon the State sovereignty of other States (depending on the cooperation with that State). Recently, the rendition to justice practice was applied in a systematic way in dealing with the prosecution of piracy in the Somalia-Gulf of Aden area. Several defendants ended up in criminal trials in European States without any <b>extradition</b> <b>procedure</b> at all. The rendition to justice was widened into a rendition to secure policy and in this way the extraordinary rendition was born. Extraordinary rendition is also a special administrative measure, but one that fundamentally changes the meaning of rendition, as the aim is no longer to adjudicate a person, but to keep him/her in secret detention for interrogation. In this context, the paper observes also the way extraordinary rendition is reflected in The Inter-American Court of Human Rights jurisprudence and in European Court of Human Rights standards...|$|E

40|$|The Treaty of Amsterdam stipulated {{the fact}} that the European Union must {{maintain}} and develop an area of freedom, security and justice, freedom assuming the existence of a common judicial area in which European citizens are able to seek justice in any of the member state same as in their own country. This goal aims to eliminate the possibility that criminals exploit the differences between the legal systems of the member states, imposing that the judgments are recognized and enforced abroad without the formalities laid down by the classical conventions on international judicial assistance. The Council Framework Decision 2002 / 584 /JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States, materialized the decision taken in Tampere, following that between EU Member States to be replace the formal <b>extradition</b> <b>procedure</b> of the people who evade the execution of a sentence of imprisonment imposed by a judgment of conviction became final, with a simplified surrender procedure. ...|$|E
40|$|Currently, the <b>extradition</b> <b>procedure</b> {{between the}} European Union member {{states and the}} United States of America {{proceeds}} {{in accordance with the}} stipulations of extradition Agreement signed at Washington DC on June the 25 th 2003. The agreement came into force in Romania together with its adhesion to the European Union on January the 1 st 2007. From the beginning of the last century until the adhesion to European Union, the extradition between Romania and the United States of America proceeded in accordance with the 1924 extradition Convention. The signing of the extradition Treaty between Romania and United States of America represents a very important document which certifies the direct implication of Romania in the judicial collaboration in criminal matter by preventing and combating the transnational delinquency and punishing the persons who committed various crimes. According to the stipulations of the Agreement with the European Union, the extradition is given for the most part of the crimes provisioned in the legislation of the two states, on condition that the privative of liberty penalty stated in the two countries legislations is at least one year or bigger, and in case of execution of a penalty, the privative of liberty penalty left should be at least 4 months. Also, the extradition should also be provided for when the crime is committed outside the territory of the solicitant state, if other conditions are accomplished and the legislation of the solicitant state allows the application of a penalty for a crime that is committed outside its territory or in similar circumstances. The Treaty allows the extradition of its own citizens, and also of the persons who live on the territory of the solicited state. In the <b>extradition</b> <b>procedure,</b> temporary imprisonment, temporary delivery and postponed delivery, simplified procedure etc., are mentioned as well. Similar to other international judicial instruments, the Treaty also states the situations in which the extradition cannot be given, when the solicited state must inform the solicitant state about the reasons of this decision. The treaty also provides a series of provisions which do not do justice for the Romanian state, so they have been modified and examined, being objectionable, in our opinion, and the proper solution is modifying and completing the concerned normative international act...|$|E

40|$|The European Arrest Warrant was the {{necessary}} {{response to the}} increase in cross-border crime, which had been a result produced by the liquidation of the internal state boundary. Furthermore it represents a fully new system of judicial cooperation in criminal matters among the Member States of European Union, based on principle of mutual trust and on the principle of recognition of judicial decisions and judgments. At the first stage the thesis "Implementation of European Arrest Warrant" describes the historical events marking or directly leading the adoption of the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States by the Council of the European Union on 13 th June 2002. Then major differences between this new institute and its former legislation, <b>extradition</b> <b>procedures,</b> are being analyzed. The main part is being focused on problems that occurred during transposition of the named Framework decision into Member States' internal law systems, from time, content and constitutional compliance point of view while with this last the complications that Czech republic, Germany, Poland and Belgium faced are being described. Even though no doubts that the implementation of European Arrest Warrant encountered a lot of troubles we can not simply deny that it made enormously the whole process of surrender more easy and quicker which was absolutely needed in these times of increasing cross-border criminality and real danger of terrorism while the old <b>extradition</b> <b>procedures</b> were fully obsolete and too formal.
