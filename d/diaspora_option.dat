The {{reason for this is}} that in today's knowledge and skills-based economy the loss of highly qualiﬁed human resources is a critical issue for any country and especially for developing countries. Strategies have been implemented during the last three decades to counteract the brain drain, but these have not been very successful. A new and promising strategy is now emerging, this is referred to as the "diaspora option". The <b>diaspora</b> <b>option</b> seeks to mobilize highly skilled expatriates of a country to contribute to the social and economic advancement of their country of origin by ﬁnding ways of setting up links and connections between these highly skilled expatriates and the country of origin The distinguishing feature of the <b>diaspora</b> <b>option</b> is that expatriates don't have to return to the country of origin, they can stay in the host country, but contribute their skills and knowledge to their home country from wherever they are in the world. The <b>diaspora</b> <b>option</b> is quite a recent phenomenon and no systematic research has been done on the number of countries that have actually gone the diaspora route. The aim of this project was to identify and study the experiences of countries that have set up scientiﬁc/intellectual diaspora networks and to assess the success of the <b>diaspora</b> <b>option.</b> Through systematic and rigorous searches on the Internet 35 networks were identiﬁed. However, because not all of them could strictly be classiﬁed as scientiﬁc/intellectual diaspora networks, only twelve networks were chosen for analysis. After careful investigation of the information available on these networks, it is concluded that the <b>diaspora</b> <b>option,</b> although not without potential pitfalls, is indeed a viable solution to the brain drain...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor {{a lot of}} researchers, {{international}} migration has particularly undergone a change during recent decades. In 2006, the recently released report by General Secretary of the United Nations on {{international migration}} and development suggested a “new era of mobility” which is characterized mainly by a non-permanent, or “circular migration”. Although the impact of circular migration on development {{is far from being}} determined, a current literature review suggests a growing optimistic tendency towards development. This optimism is based mainly on downfall of old migration structure in which emigrants are considered “a loss” for their countries (Southern country) and immigrants are therefore “won” by the country of destination (Northern country), entering through a direct influence of brain drain i. e. depreciation of human capital and consequently reduction of the economic growth of developing countries. In fact, today, emigrants and their children are key players in the development plans of many developing countries. In addition to the induced effect of brain drain as a stimulus to domestic education, the value of emigrants comes generally from their contribution from far (<b>diaspora</b> <b>option),</b> and also the huge benefits of their return back home (return option). Thus, circular migration implies a “brain drain” followed by a “brain gain” (feedback effect) where we find both the <b>diaspora</b> <b>option</b> and especially the return option, from which the economies of developing countries can benefit in terms of economic growth through technology transfer of their nationals in the North, including remittances, links to international trade and foreign investment and diaspora networks (<b>diaspora</b> <b>option).</b> Also another advantage is the physical return of nationals (return option) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor {{a growing}} number of researchers, {{international}} migration has particularly undergone a change in recent decades. In 2006, the recently released Report of the General Secretary of the United Nations on International Migration and Development suggested a “new era of mobility” characterized in part by a greater degree of non-permanent, or circular migration. Although the impact of circular migration on development is far from being determined, a current literature review suggests a growing optimism about its potential of development. This optimism comes mainly from the erosion of the migration structure traditionally polarized in which emigrants are seen as “loss” for the country of origin (Southern country) and immigrants are therefore “won” by the country of destination (Northern country), entering through a direct effect of brain drain i. e. the depreciation of human capital and consequently the reduction of the economic growth of developing countries. In fact, today, emigrants and their descendants are key players in the development agenda of a number of developing countries. In addition to the induced effect of brain drain as a stimulus to domestic education, the value of emigrants comes not only from what they can contribute from far (<b>diaspora</b> <b>option),</b> but also that what they can cause through their return to their country of origin (return option). Thus, in the context of circular migration, there is a brain drain followed by a brain gain (feedback effect) in which we find both the <b>diaspora</b> <b>option</b> and especially the return option, from which the economies of developing countries can benefit in terms of economic growth through technology transfer of their nationals in the North, including on the one hand remittances, links with international trade and foreign direct investment and diaspora networks (<b>diaspora</b> <b>option),</b> {{and on the other hand}} the physical return of nationals (return option) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis article aims to {{investigate}} Romania's potential of turning medical brain drain into brain gain, focusing on three directions of study: the return intention, the <b>diaspora</b> <b>option</b> and the remittances. The {{nature of the}} study is exploratory. A survey was conducted among Romanian physicians (trained in Romania) with an international work experience (currently working abroad or those who worked abroad and returned). Data collected was analyzed using SPSS 19. The main findings constitute a valuable instrument for policy makers in the health system, offering an overview of the possible areas of intervention...|$|E
40|$|Scientific {{networking}} is {{the most}} accessible way a country can turn the brain drain into brain gain. Diaspora’s members offer valuable information, advice or financial support from the destination country, without being necessary to return. This article aims to investigate Romania’s potential of turning brain drain into brain networking, using evidence from the medical sector. The main factors influencing the collaboration with the country of origin are investigated. The conclusions suggest that Romania could benefit from the <b>diaspora</b> <b>option,</b> through an active implication at institutional level and {{the implementation of a}} strategy in this area...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of developing countries are considering their highly qualified citizens living abroad as a potential asset for national development. Renewed policies are consequently designed {{in order to ensure}} the return of this expatriated talented group. Besides the repatriation-return-option generally enacted in these policies with varying success, a second one has recently emerged : the <b>diaspora</b> <b>option.</b> It consists of the remote mobilisation of intellectuals abroad and their connection to scientific, technological and cultural programmes at home. At the beginning of the 1990 s, Colombia began to systematically and consistently apply this option, through the creation of the "Colombian Caldas Network of Scientists and Engineers Abroad". The experience of this strategy has been studied during the last four years by a Franco-Colombian research team. The paper discusses the results of this study. It first contextualises the <b>diaspora</b> <b>option</b> and the Colombian experience by putting it in historical perspective along with the other policies designed to tackle the issue of professionals' migration. It then describes the S & T diaspora in terms of actors and dynamics. The way it works through the Caldas network is presented in terms of an analysis of three major aspects : the electronic list through INTERNET, the local associations (network's nodes) and some joint projects between diaspora and the home community members. The concluding part draws the significance of the experience, its achievements as well as its limitations, and suggests some indicators and methods that could help develop it elsewhere.

40|$|The {{reality of}} {{what became known as}} the ‘Zimbabwean Crisis’ has, from 2000 onwards, been ambivalently fictionalised in the Zimbabwean {{literary}} geography of the time. Writers narrativise diasporic reality and migration into the Diaspora as Janus-faced in that these could lead to the opening up of democratic spaces and improving the well-being of those who embark on the hunt for foreign currency. But some view the genesis and execution of the odyssey as analogous to responding to the call of a strange bird that certainly leads to deracination from the family, moral bankruptcy, cultural alienation and, in some instances, metaphorical and physical death. The research therefore intends to interrogate the richly varying ways in which the writers wrestle with this epochal phenomenon and the extent to which they pack and unpack the issues of motive, causality and consequences of diasporanism. In doing this the researchers intend to use the novel Harare North and selected short stories from Hunting in Foreign Lands (2010). It is the researchers’ contention that the <b>Diaspora</b> <b>option</b> enacted mixed fortunes for the sojourners, their families and the Zimbabwean society at large...|$|E
