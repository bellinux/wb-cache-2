5000|$|The station {{closed in}} 1992 {{and only one}} of the radio masts now remains. A busy <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> <b>beacon</b> (VOR), {{identifier}} [...] "DTY", for aircraft is situated approximately 4 miles (6.4 km) south of the town. The town also gives its name to the busy Daventry air traffic control sector.|$|E
5000|$|VHF Omni <b>Directional</b> <b>Radio</b> Range (VOR) {{is a type}} of {{short-range}} {{radio navigation}} system for aircraft, enabling aircraft with a receiving unit to determine their position and stay on course by receiving radio signals transmitted by a network of fixed ground <b>radio</b> <b>beacons.</b> It uses frequencies in the very high frequency (VHF) band from 108.00 to 117.95 MHz. Developed in the United States beginning in 1937 and deployed by 1946, VOR is the standard air navigational system in the world, [...] used by both commercial and general aviation. By 2000 there were about 3,000 VOR stations around the world including 1,033 in the US, reduced to 967 by 2013 with more stations being decommissioned with the widespread adoption of GPS.|$|R
50|$|The Richtfunkstelle Berlin-Frohnau (<b>Directional</b> <b>radio</b> station Berlin-Frohnau) was a {{facility}} for <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> services in Frohnau (a locality in the Reinickendorf borough of Berlin).

50|$|The <b>Directional</b> <b>Radio</b> Tower Stuttgart-Möhringen is a 93 metre high lattice {{steel tower}} for <b>directional</b> <b>radio</b> {{services}} of the EnBW AG on {{the area of the}} substation Stuttgart-Möhringen. The <b>Directional</b> <b>Radio</b> Tower Stuttgart-Möhringen was built in 1975 and is not accessible to the public.|$|R
50|$|The GPS system permits stationary, wide-view {{geosynchronous}} communications satellites {{to enhance}} the doppler position received by low Earth orbit satellites. EPIRB beacons with built-in GPS are usually called GPIRBs, for GPS position-indicating <b>radio</b> <b>beacon</b> or global position-indicating <b>radio</b> <b>beacon.</b>|$|R
50|$|An Emergency Position-Indicating Radiobeacon Station or Emergency Position Indicator <b>Radio</b> <b>Beacon</b> (short: EPIRS or EPIRB) is {{a station}} in the mobile service used in search and rescue operations.
