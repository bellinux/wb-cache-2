2500|$|Were investors able {{either to}} buy short naked (without {{borrowing}} money to pay), or sell short naked (without borrowing securities to deliver), such practices could easily lead to market manipulation of stock prices: since buyers or sellers {{would not have}} the restraint of providing cash or securities, they could conceivably have unlimited buys or sells, which would drive prices up or down. Naked short buying is not a problem because custodians and prime brokers have their own finances from which to lend money to their clients in order to settle the trades. Naked short selling can be a problem. It occurs when a prime broker is unable to borrow the stock simply because there is none available for that purpose. Hedge funds are expected to find sources of stock which can be borrowed before executing short sell orders. If they fail to do so, and their prime broker cannot borrow for them, then the settlement of such trades cannot take place on the settlement date. Whether such a [...] "fail" [...] is due to poor co-ordination among the various parties (hedge fund, lending entity and prime broker) or to a naked short sale is impossible to determine. In the US the SEC effectively ended such instances by making the cost of a failed short sell too expensive for the hedge fund to risk. If on the morning the short sell is scheduled to settle the prime broker cannot deliver the securities to the <b>executing</b> <b>broker,</b> then the latter is obligated to buy-in the shares (in effect, making the delivery). The buy-in occurs at the then prevailing market price. This may be much higher than the price at which the hedge fund first sold the securities, resulting in a potentially substantial loss to the hedge fund.|$|E

5000|$|A Commission Sharing Agreement ("CSA") {{or in the}} US named Client Commission Agreement ("CCA") {{is a type of}} soft dollar {{arrangement}} that allows money managers to separately pay the <b>executing</b> <b>broker</b> for trade execution and ask that broker to allocate a portion of the commission directly to an independent research provider. CSAs consist of a percentage of execution fees, that are directed to pay for research reports from sell-side banks. The form of a CSA can be as short as one page. One of the disadvantages of CSAs is the counterparty risk, that the broker becomes as the cash is held on the broker's balance sheet [...] and not in a segregated client account. Moves included in MiFID II such as the creation of Research Payment Accounts (RPAs) aim to address this issue.|$|E

40|$|Recently many {{scalable}} {{and efficient}} solutions for event dissemination in publish/subscribe (pub/ sub) systems {{have appeared in}} the literature. This dissemination is usually done over an overlay network of brokers and its cost can be measured as the number of messages sent over the overlay to allow the event to reach all intended subscribers. Efficient solutions to this problem are often obtained through smart dissemination algorithms that avoid flooding events on the overlay. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach that obtains efficient event dissemination by reorganizing the overlay network topology. More specifically, this reorganization is done through a self-organizing algorithm <b>executed</b> by <b>brokers</b> whose aim is to directly connect, through overlay links, pairs of brokers matching same events. In this way, on average, the number of brokers involved in an event dissemination decreases, thus reducing its cost. Even though the paradigm of the self-organizing algorithm is general and then applicable to any overlay-based pub/sub system, its concrete implementation depends on the specific system. As a consequence, we studied the effect of the introduction of the self-organizing algorithm {{in the context of a}} specific system implementing a tree-based routing strategy, namely SIENA, showing the actual performance benefits through an extensiv...|$|R

50|$|MetaTrader provide {{two types}} of trading orders, Pending Orders and Market Orders. Pending orders will be {{executed}} only when the price reaches a predefined level, whereas Market orders can be executed {{in one of the}} four modes: Instant execution, Request execution, Market execution, and Exchange execution. With Instant execution, the order will be executed at the price displayed in the platform. Its advantage is that the order will be executed at a known price. However, a good trading opportunity can be missed when the volatility is high and the requested price cannot be served. Request execution mode enables trader to execute a Market order in two steps — first, a price quote is requested, then, a trader decides whether to buy or sell using the received price. A trader has several seconds to decide if the received price is worth trading. Such mode offers a certain knowledge of price combined with guaranteed execution at that price. The tradeoff is the reduced speed of execution, which can take a lot longer than other modes. With Market execution, the orders will be <b>executed</b> with <b>broker's</b> price even if it is different from that displayed in the platform. The advantage of this mode is that it allows trading without any sort of requotes. However, deviation can get considerable during volatile price changes. In Exchange execution mode, the order is processed by the external execution facility (the exchange). The trade is executed according to the current depth of market.|$|R

40|$|We study competitive, but strategic, <b>brokers</b> <b>executing</b> trades for an {{informed}} trader in a multi-period setting. The brokers {{can choose to}} (a) execute the order, as agents, first, and trade for themselves, as dealers, afterwards; or (b) trade for themselves first and execute the order later. We show that the equilibrium outcome depends {{on the number of}} brokers. When the number of brokers exceeds a critical number (greater than one), the informed trader distributes his order (equally) among the available brokers. The <b>brokers,</b> in turn, <b>execute</b> the informed trader's order first and trade personal quantities, as dealers, afterwards. When the number of brokers is below this critical value, the informed trader gives his order to a single broker, who, in turn, trades personal quantities as a dealer first and executes the informed trader's order second. Since the informed trader is hurt in the latter case, he prefers markets with many brokers. Thus, regulators can mitigate trading abuses arising from a conflict of interest between brokers' agency and principal functions (such as front running) by encouraging competition between brokers as an alternative to banning such practices. We empirically show that the critical number of brokers for the favorable competitive equilibrium appears to be satisfied for the futures contracts in our sample. Stock market; Competition...|$|R

He operated his membership as a Floor <b>Broker,</b> <b>executing</b> orders for other members and member firms {{on the floor of the}} NYSE. Ambassador Doley began his professional career in investment banking in 1968. He served as Vice President with major Wall Street firms prior to buying his own seat.

During this period, Ambassador Doley also affected and counseled on a number of mergers and acquisitions of life insurance companies. Ambassador Doley is the Co-Founder of the U.S. Africa Chamber of Commerce. He chaired the investment committee of Southern Africa Enterprise Development Fund's (SAEDF) private equity fund and placed the first black market maker on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Over the years he’s advised African stock exchanges and the regulatory bodies of those stock exchanges.

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} players are active in the secondary markets. Regular individuals account for {{a small proportion of}} trading, though their share has slightly increased; in the 20th century it was mostly only a few wealthy individuals who could afford an account with a broker, but accounts are now much cheaper and accessible over the internet. There are now numerous small traders who can buy and sell on the secondary markets using platforms provided by brokers which are accessible via web browsers. When such an individual trades on the capital markets, it will often involve a two-stage transaction. First they place an order with their broker, then the <b>broker</b> <b>executes</b> the trade. If the trade can be done on an exchange, the process will often be fully automated. If a dealer needs to manually intervene, this will often mean a larger fee. Traders in investment banks will often make deals on their bank's behalf, as well as executing trades for their clients. Investment banks will often have a division (or department) called capital markets: staff in this division try to keep aware of the various opportunities in both the primary and secondary markets, and will advise major clients accordingly. Pension and sovereign wealth funds tend to have the largest holdings, though they tend to buy only the highest grade (safest) types of bonds and shares, and often don't trade all that frequently. According to a 2012 Financial Times article, hedge funds are increasingly making most of the short term trades in large sections of the capital market (like the UK and US stock exchanges), which is making it harder for them to maintain their historically high returns, as they are increasingly finding themselves trading with each other rather than with less sophisticated investors.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{three types}} of investment manager trading behaviour to ascertain whether behavioural biases {{are present in the}} Australian investment management industry. In particular, this thesis examines whether these biases are detrimental to fund performance and market efficiency, and whether {{there is a need for}} regulatory review given the behaviour of institutions in their trading on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The three empirical issues examined in this thesis are: leader and follower patterns in institutional trading; quarter-end gaming behaviour; and short-term trading activity and the role of institutional monitoring. Firstly, in the analysis of leader-follower behaviour, this thesis finds profitable trade packages are <b>executed</b> using multiple <b>brokers</b> as a way to accumulate a larger package in a shorter window of time and as means of enhancing disguise. Profitability is higher when these trade packages are mimicked and when there are up to three mimickers, compared to situations in which no mimicking occurs. Potential mimickers do not appear to ignore their own signal when deciding whether or not to follow when the sequence is short, but may do so for longer sequences as predicted by Grenadier (1999). It is concluded that short sequences of mimicking trades by active fund managers speed the price discovery process. Secondly, in an investigation of &# 145;portfolio pumping&# 146; by Australian active investment managers, this thesis finds significant abnormal stock and fund returns on the final business day of the calendar quarter-end. This thesis then identifies particular trades, appearing mostly in less liquid stocks, which accompany stocks that are marked up at quarter-end (it is not possible in this thesis to prove causation given the trades in this sample are not time-stamped). Fund managers execute more purchases than normal on the last day of the quarter in stocks in which they are overweight, providing strong evidence that manager behaviour is modified on the last day of the quarter-end. This study also finds poor-performing managers are more likely to perpetrate gaming trades, which may be as a result of career concerns and business risk management. New investors in funds would benefit substantially by delaying their entry to the fund until the day after the end of the quarter, as there is a lower entry price into the fund. However, portfolio pumping does not substantially affect the returns of extant fund investors, as the trading cost associated with the relatively small gaming trades is relatively small. Attempts by the ASX to reduce price manipulation, such as instituting a closing price call auction and then later revising the algorithm of this auction, have been effective in limiting both the number of occurrences, as well as the severity of gaming on the efficiency of the market. Thirdly, in an examination of the short-term trading activity of active investment managers which threaten exit, this thesis find that a larger number of actively trading multi-blockholders significantly raises firm performance. It remains true that an individual blockholder who intervenes to raise firm performance has to share gains with other blockholders. But firm manager effort is enhanced by the threat of exit by blockholders when they receive a bad signal concerning managerial effort. This study tests seven nested hypotheses proposed by Edmans and Manso (2008) using sequences of short-term institutional trades that threaten exit. Blockholder net profit is diminishing in the number of traders, consistent with a common signal of poor managerial performance. Moreover, these trade sequences are profitable even after transaction costs. Spreads are lower and the firm&# 146;s share price becomes more sensitive to managerial performance as more blockholders threaten exit. From the three broad investigations into fund manager activity this thesis undertakes, active fund managers are shown to behave rationally and, apart from their behaviour at quarter-end, they act in the interests of their investors, aid price discovery, reduce bid-ask spreads and thereby exhibit a positive influence on market efficiency...|$|R
