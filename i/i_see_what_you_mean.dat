6000|$|... "Of course I do, mother, and <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> now. Certainly I {{will change}} my things in future. You don't mind, do you, Bill?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean, Mr. Goble," [...] assented the stage-director obsequiously. [...] "It {{has perhaps}} a little too much--er--not quite enough--yes, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well! <b>I</b> believe <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean,' he said, {{studying}} {{her with a}} gravity that was amusing. 'There's your youngest sister, Octavia, is not she?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> I {{should say}} {{it had begun}} of late. Do you think it so bad a sign?" [...] she asked anxiously.|$|E
60|$|THE MAN. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> now. You dare {{set up to}} be my father. Thank heaven Ive not a drop of your vile {{blood in}} my veins.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> Belle! You {{think that}} because Dave did that Jessie thinks he might get more {{interested}} in her than would otherwise be the case." ...|$|E
6000|$|O culpable! I acknowledge--I expose! [...] (O admirers, praise not me--compliment not me--you make me wince, [...] <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do not--I know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do not.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean,' said Lord Dawlish, who didn't at all. He thought rather {{highly of}} the number one {{companies}} that hailed from the theatre of which Mr Maginnis was proprietor.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' said Mr Podsnap. 'Easy to say somewhere; {{not so easy}} to say where! But <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{are driving}} at. I knew it from the first. Centralization. No. Never with my consent. Not English.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'She {{will not}} feel that,' said Ethel; 'but indeed, Tom, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> and like it. It is yourself, {{and not the}} conferrer of the benefit, that {{you want her to}} care for.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she pensively assented. [...] "I suppose it's as if {{you took}} to some very common kind of whiskey, isn't it? <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> If one must, {{it ought to be}} champagne." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am, though," [...] said Herrick; [...] "she {{lives with}} my father.--O, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean," [...] he added. [...] "My {{real name is}} Herrick. No more Hay"--they had both used the same alias,--"no more Hay than yours, I daresay." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean," [...] {{the poet}} assented. [...] "But you cannot have the seasons {{out of their}} order in the {{rearrangement}} of the mortal conditions. You must have spring and you must have summer before you can have autumn." ...|$|R
60|$|JOHN. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> But Maggie wouldn't think {{better of}} me for any false pretences. She knows my {{feelings}} for her now are neither more nor {{less than what}} they have always been.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> No, I don't know. I said bolted, {{meaning that}} it was fastened, and I could not open it, but I believe all the doors were found bolted on the inside." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I'm glad you're pleased! You must be if I {{tell you}} that I like you now even better. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are, except for the {{question}} of fortune. It doesn't perhaps matter much, but have you any money? I mean have you a fine income?' ...|$|R
6000|$|ERNEST. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> {{and there}} is much in it. But surely you would admit that the great poems of the early world, the primitive, {{anonymous}} collective poems, {{were the result of}} the imagination of races, rather than of the imagination of individuals? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> It was a {{great loss}} to you in one sense, but of course you couldn't have the same feeling about her {{as in the case}} of Mrs. Chance. She was, I understand, a toothless old hag, more than half-crazy--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll back myself {{against any}} Englishman, Frenchman, German, or Italian, {{for a large}} sum of money. I can't come quite up to the Poles. The fact is, the honester the man is the worse he always dances. Yes; <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> I must be a rogue. Perhaps I am;--perhaps I'm only an exception. I knew your father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your meals,' {{continued}} Madame Mantalini, 'that is, {{dinner and}} tea, {{you will take}} here.

6000|$|She {{looked at}} me without resentment or spite, and at the truth I had put before her with candour, credulity, pity. I was {{afterwards}} happy to remember that she must have gathered from my face the liveliness of my interest in herself. “I think <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Maisie {{turned this}} over, but more for {{apparent}} consideration than from any impulse to yield too easily. [...] "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> But {{at that time}} they weren't free."

6000|$|Jake {{smiled in}} a curious way. [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> Miss Kenwardine likes me, but {{although}} I've some artistic taste, I'm frankly flesh and blood; and that's not quite her style. She finds me a little more in harmony with her than the rest, but this is all. Still, it's something to me. Now you understand matters, perhaps you won't take so much trouble to keep me out of Santa Brigida." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am rather {{glad when}} the time comes to go to bed," [...] said Miss Oliver. [...] "I like the {{darkness}} because I can be myself in it--I needn't smile or talk bravely. But sometimes my imagination gets out of hand, too, and <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do--terrible things--terrible years to come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{play the}} piano? Music is different. [...] . But <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean." [...] They tried to invent {{theories}} {{and to make}} their theories agree.

60|$|C. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{are driving}} at, Aunt Phrasie; but I cannot go back till I have {{finished}} these courses.
