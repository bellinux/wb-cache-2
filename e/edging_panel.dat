The problem on Columbia was that the damage was sustained from a foam strike to the reinforced carbon-carbon leading <b>edge</b> <b>panel</b> of the wing, not the heat tiles. The first Shuttle mission, STS-1, had a protruding gap filler that diverted hot gas into the right wheel well on re-entry, resulting in a buckling of the right main landing gear door.|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study was}} conducted to determine the influence of clocking angle of a foam projectile impacting a space shuttle leading <b>edge</b> wing <b>panel.</b> Four simulations were performed using LS-DYNA. The leading <b>edge</b> <b>panels</b> are fabricated of multiple layers of reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) material. The RCC material was represented using Mat 58, which is a material property {{that can be used for}} laminated composite fabrics. Simulations were performed of a rectangular-shaped foam block, weighing 0. 23 -lb., impacting RCC Panel 9 on the top surface. The material properties of the foam were input using Mat 83. The impact velocity was 1, 000 ft/s along the Orbiter X-axis. In two models, the foam impacted on a corner, in one model the foam impacted the panel initially on the 2 -in. -long edge, and in the last model the foam impacted the panel on the 7 -in. - long edge.

40|$|The {{effect of}} various {{parameters}} on the flutter of elliptic panels is studied by simple theoretical analyses.

Structural damping is, in general, destabilising, except for very low values of the ratio of structural and aerodynamic damping coefficients. The addition of a concentrated mass may also have a destabilising effect, depending upon {{the position of the}} added mass. The effect of sweepback is stabilising or destabilising, depending on whether the panel aspect ratio is less than, or greater than, unity. The effect of variations in the edge conditions is shown for the case of circular panels where the difference between simply supported and fully clamped edges corresponds to a difference of 20 % in critical panel thickness...|$|R
5000|$|The {{panel is}} either {{captured}} in a groove {{made in the}} inside edge of the frame members or housed in an edge rabbet made in the rear inside <b>edge.</b> <b>Panels</b> are made slightly smaller than the available space within the frame to provide room for movement. Wood will expand and contract across the grain, and a wide panel made of solid wood could change width by a half of an inch, warping the door frame. By allowing the wood panel to float, it can expand and contract without damaging the door. A typical panel would be cut to allow 1/4" [...] (5 mm) between itself and {{the bottom of the}} groove in the frame. It is common to place some sort of elastic material in the groove between the <b>edge</b> of the <b>panel</b> and the frame before assembly. These items center the panel in the frame and absorb seasonal movement. A popular item for this purpose is a small rubber ball, known as a spaceball (a trademarked product). Some cabinet makers will also use small pieces of cork to allow for movement. The panels are usually either flat or raised.|$|R

25|$|The {{design of}} Enterprise {{was not the}} same as that planned for , the first flight model; the aft {{fuselage}} was constructed differently, and it did not have the interfaces to mount OMS pods. A large number of subsystems—ranging from main engines to radar equipment—were not installed on Enterprise, but the capacity to add them in the future was retained, as NASA originally intended to refit the orbiter for spaceflight at the conclusion of its testing. Instead of a thermal protection system, its surface was primarily covered with simulated tiles made from polyurethane foam. Fiberglass was used for the leading <b>edge</b> <b>panels</b> in place of the reinforced carbon–carbon ones of spaceflight-worthy orbiters. Only a few sample thermal tiles and some Nomex blankets were real. Enterprise used fuel cells to generate its electrical power, but these were not sufficient to power the orbiter for spaceflight.|$|R
50|$|After {{moving the}} panel {{to the proper}} {{deployment}} location as indicated on the Panel Layout Diagram for the project, the panel is unfolded or unrolled from the shipping pallet. The pallet is usually on a front-end loader or forklift which moves backwards to facilitate unfolding or unrolling of the panel. Pulling the geomembrane panel off the pallet or the roll by a chain is not recommended because it may damage the geomembrane. Deployment personnel are then positioned approximately 4.6 m apart along the <b>edges</b> of the <b>panel</b> to unfold and move the panel into the proper location. If the edge to be gripped is to be subsequently welded or bonded, the <b>panel</b> <b>edge</b> is folded back about 0.6 to 1.0 m, creating a fold. The fold is gripped using the 0.3 m long by 10 mm (1-foot long by 2 inch) diameter smooth wooden dowel or a smooth grade stake rather than the edge itself. This is to avoid stretching the <b>panel</b> <b>edge</b> where {{it is to be}} bonded to another panel. As the panel is pulled out, it is necessary to maintain air under the geomembrane to reduce friction with the ground surface. This can be accomplished by holding the <b>panel</b> <b>edge</b> and advancing at a rate fast enough to create air under the geomembrane as it is unfolded. Another method is to “fan” air under the geomembrane by raising and lowering the <b>edge</b> of the <b>panel</b> to create a wave-like action across the liner as it is being spread. After the panel is set in the exact position, it is welded or bonded to adjacent panels.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a vehicle}} travels on jointed {{concrete}} roads {{the weight of}} the vehicle passes from one concrete panel to the next.

This can cause cracks as pavement shears off the <b>edge</b> of the <b>panel.</b> On older highways built in the early-to-mid 20th century, dowel bars (steel rods) were placed across the joints to help transfer the load from one panel to the next.|$|R
