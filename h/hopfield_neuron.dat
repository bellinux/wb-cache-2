40|$|The <b>Hopfield</b> <b>neuron</b> with {{predictive}} hysteresis {{is proposed}} and {{the efficiency of}} employing these neurons in analog to digital conversion, via the Hopfield Neural Network, will be demonstrated. Traditional hysteresis is defined, generally, as the occurrence of a delayed effect when forces acting on an object are varied. It will be shown that predictive hysteresis, a type of reverse hysteresis, improves upon the speed of hysteretic and non hysteretic systems without compromising the accuracy...|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{in which the}} neuron serves as an information channel. Channel distortion occurs through the channel since the mapping from input boolean codes to output codes are many-to-one in that neuron outputs consist of just two distinguished states. Within the described model, the neuron performs a decision-making function. Decisions are made regarding the validity of a question passively posed by the neuron. This question becomes defined through learning hence learning is viewed as the process of determining an appropriate question based on supplied input ensembles. An application of the Shannon information measures of entropy and mutual information taken together {{in the context of}} the proposed model lead to the <b>Hopfield</b> <b>neuron</b> model with conditionalized Hebbian learning rules. Neural decisions are shown to be based on a sigmoidal transfer characteristic or in the limit as computational temperature tends to zero, a maximum likelihood decision rule. The described work is cont [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a model system of two coupled <b>Hopfield</b> <b>neurons,</b> which {{is described by}} delay differential equations {{taking into account the}} finite signal propagation and processing times. When the delay exceeds a critical value, a limit cycle emerges via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. First, we calculate its frequency and trajectory perturbatively by applying the Poincaré-Lindstedt method. Then, the perturbation series are resummed by means of the Shohat expansion in good agreement with numerical values. However, with increasing delay, the accuracy of the results from the Shohat expansion worsens. We thus apply variational perturbation theory (VPT) to the perturbation expansions to obtain more accurate results, which moreover hold even in the limit of large delays.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the effect of}} asymmetric temporal delays {{in a system of}} two coupled <b>Hopfield</b> <b>neurons.</b> For couplings of opposite signs, a limit cycle emerges via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation when the sum of the delays reaches a critical value. We show that the angular frequency of the limit cycle is independent of an asymmetry in the delays. However, the delay asymmetry determines the phase difference between the periodic activities of the two components. Specifically, when the connection with negative coupling has a delay much larger than the delay for the positive coupling, the system approaches in-phase synchrony between the two components. Employing variational perturbation theory (VPT), we achieve an approximate analytical evaluation of the phase shift, in good agreement with numerical results. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|We rigorously {{establish}} {{a close relationship}} between message passing algorithms and models of neurodynamics by showing that the equations of a continuous Hopfield network {{can be derived from}} the equations of belief propagation on a binary Markov random field. As Hopfield networks are equipped with a Lyapunov function, convergence is guaranteed. As a consequence, in the limit of many weak connections per <b>neuron,</b> <b>Hopfield</b> networks exactly implement a continuous-time variant of belief propagation starting from message initialisations that prevent from running into convergence problems. Our results lead {{to a better understanding of}} the role of message passing algorithms in real biological neural networks. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{continuous}} hysteresis <b>neurons</b> <b>Hopfield</b> neural network architecture for efficiently solving crossbar switch problems. A Hopfield neural network architecture with continuous hysteresis and its collective computational properties are studied. It is proved theoretically and confirmed by simulating the randomly generated Hopfield neural network with continuous hysteresis neurons. The network architecture {{is applied to}} a crossbar switch problem and results of computer simulations are presented and used to illustrate the computation power of the network architecture. The simulation {{results show that the}} Hopfield neural network architecture with continuous hysteresis neurons is much better than the previous works including the original Hopfield neural network architecture, maximum neural network and Hopfield neural network with hysteresis binary neurons for crossbar switch problem in terms of both the computation time and the solution quality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{simplest}} graph {{drawing method}} {{is that of}} putting the ver-tices of a graph on a line and drawing the edges as half-circles either above or below the line. Such drawings are called two-page book drawings. The smallest number of crossings over all two-page drawings of a graph G is called the two-page crossing number of G. Cimikowski and Shope have solved the two-page crossing number problem for an n-vertex andm-edge graph by using a Hopfield network with 2 m neurons. We present here an improved <b>Hopfield</b> model withm <b>neurons.</b> The new model achieves much better performance {{in the quality of}} solutions and is more efficient than the model of Cimikowski and Shope for all graphs tested. The parallel time complexity of the algorithm, without considering the crossing number cal-culations, is O(m) for the new Hopfield model with m processors clearly outperforming the previous algorithm.

40|$|Neural {{networks}} {{have been used}} in various applications on the World Wide Web, but most of them only rely on the available input-output examples without incorporating Web-specific knowledge, such as Web link analysis, into the network design. In this paper, we propose a new approach in which the Web is modeled as an asymmetric <b>Hopfield</b> Net. Each <b>neuron</b> in the network represents a Web page, and the connections between neurons represent the hyperlinks between Web pages. Web content analysis and Web link analysis are also incorporated into the model by adding a page content score function and a link score function into the weights of the neurons and the synapses, respectively. A simulation study was conducted to compare the proposed model with traditional Web search algorithms, namely, a breadth-first search and a best-first search using PageRank as the heuristic. The results showed that the proposed model performed more efficiently and effectively in searching for domain-specific Web pages. We believe that the model can also be useful in other Web applications such as Web page clustering and search result ranking. © 2007 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
