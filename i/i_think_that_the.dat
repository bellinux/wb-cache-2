5|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band went on... {{maybe not}} a tangent, {{but we had}} a goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And I think we showed too much. I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
500|$|With {{the opening}} of trade between England and Japan, Japanese imports, art and styles became fashionable in London, making the time ripe for an opera set in Japan. Gilbert said, [...] "I cannot {{give you a good}} reason for our... piece being laid in Japan. It... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> idea of a chief magistrate, who is... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public." ...|$|E

500|$|The book {{is divided}} into two sections. The first section {{describes}} Fenwick's own experiences of the training; the second analyzes the est program's methodology and effects. In her analysis of the course, she states, [...] "While the consensus of informed opinion, based on summaries of research findings, is that interventions similar to the est training have only modestly positive effects, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> existing research provides us with an underestimate of the effect of the est training. [...] This training represents a distillation {{of some of the most}} powerful techniques and central precepts for attitude and behavior change … I would guess that the effects of the est training are substantial for a large proportion of people.” ...|$|E
500|$|When {{discussing}} the meaning behind [...] "Ugly", Fantasia {{said that she}} wanted to help someone, and said, [...] "My grandmother taught me that your test will help someone along the way." [...] During an interview with People, she explained that she intended for the track to reach [...] "every young girl out there who’s gonna go through everything I went through, and more" [...] as well as older women. Connecting the lyrics with her own childhood, Fantasia said, [...] "I was very insecure growing up, and even though I'm not that girl anymore, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> passion, that not feeling pretty and being insecure is where my soul came from. And from early childhood, I let it free onstage." ...|$|E
500|$|When Beck {{left the}} group in October 1966, Page became the sole guitarist. [...] Although several new songs were added, set lists still {{included}} their earlier material. [...] A 1968 live performance in New York City (released in 1971 as [...] ) features the core songs, plus the Page solo piece [...] "White Summer" [...] and {{an early version of}} [...] "Dazed and Confused". [...] Page carried over these songs to Led Zeppelin and [...] "Smokestack Lightning" [...] became a medley, which developed into [...] "How Many More Times". [...] Dreja sums up the lasting appeal: [...] "We all feel, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> period Jeff spent with the band was the most creative. [...] His scope of inventiveness was probably the widest of the three guitarists we played with—and none of them were exactly slouches." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{cast and}} filmmakers {{attended}} several press conferences {{that allowed them}} to address issues surrounding the film, including its authenticity, Alan Moore's reaction to it and its intended political message. The film was intended to be a departure from some of Moore's original themes. In the words of Hugo Weaving: [...] "Alan Moore was writing about something which happened some time ago. It was a response to living in Thatcherite Britain... This is a response to {{the world in which we}} live today. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film and the graphic novel are two separate entities." [...] Regarding the film's controversial political content, the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers or tell viewers what to think.|$|E
500|$|In April 2010, it was {{announced}} that Hammer Films and Dark Horse Comics were producing a four-issue comic book limited series based on the film. Marc Andreyko wrote the comic. The series, titled Let Me In: Crossroads, is a prequel to the film. The first issue has Abby and her [...] "guardian" [...] facing a ruthless real-estate tycoon who wants to steal their home and was released in December 2010. Original author John Ajvide Lindqvist said [...] "Nobody has asked me about [...] and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> project stinks. I am looking into this matter and hope that they have no right to do this." [...] Later, he informed fans that he had in fact unwittingly sold the rights for the comic to be made, stating that the producers had misinformed him as {{to the nature of the}} contract he had signed.|$|E
500|$|The film is Spielberg's {{third on}} the subject of alien visitation, along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Producer and {{longtime}} collaborator Kathleen Kennedy notes that with War of the Worlds, Spielberg had the opportunity to explore the antithesis of the characters brought to life in E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. [...] "When we first started developing E.T., it was a much edgier, darker story and it actually evolved into something that was more benign. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> edgier, darker story has always been somewhere inside him. [...] Now, he's telling that story." [...] Spielberg stated that he just {{thought it would be fun}} to make a [...] "really scary film with really scary aliens", something which he had never done before. Spielberg was intent on telling a contemporary story, with Kennedy stating the story was created as a fantasy, but depicted in a hyper-realistic way.|$|E

500|$|Ruben F. Coleman {{also said}} {{afterward}} {{that he thought}} Tom was armed, though he later equivocated on this point. He {{was quoted in the}} October 27 issue of The Tombstone Epitaph in which he said, [...] "Tom McLaury fell first, but raised and fired again before he died." [...] Coleman also testified at the coroner’s inquest one day later. Part-time newspaper reporter Howell 'Pat' Hayhurst transcribed all of the testimony from the hearing in the early 1930s as part of the Federal Writers' Project, in the Works Progress Administration. When he transcribed Coleman's second testimony, he quoted Coleman as saying, [...] "Tom McLaury, after the first two shots were fired, ran down Fremont Street and fell ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> report I gave to the Epitaph was pretty near correct as published." [...] However, it's known that Hayhurst arbitrarily removed text that he decided was not relevant. Author Stuart N. Lake later said Hayhurst ‘mutilated’ the transcription. The documents were subsequently lost and are still unaccounted for.|$|E
500|$|Actor Henry Ian Cusick {{and actress}} Georgina Haig guest {{starred in the}} episode {{as a pair of}} Federal agents. Cusick had worked with co-creator J.J. Abrams and {{executive}} producer Pinkner on the ABC series, Lost. Cusick stated that most of his scenes were filmed with Haig and John Noble (Walter Bishop), and that the story leaves a possibility for the return of their characters in the future. Noble found it unusual to film an episode that did not involve the lead actors. He explained, [...] "That was Walter with two really big, important guest stars, Henry Ian Cusick and Georgina Haig. It felt, to me, like it was a really strong episode. The two guest actors did a fantastic job, which is not easy to do, to step into an established company. It is out of the box and is somewhere else completely. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fans will love it. Some fans of this type of material will like it anyway because Henry Ian Cusick was such a big star in Lost, but also, this new girl is just full of wonderful energy, too." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Cold Case Love" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by The Y's (Justin Timberlake, Robin Tadross and James Fauntleroy II). At the [...] "Justin Timberlake & Friends Concert in Las Vegas", Timberlake told MTV News that Rated R {{is a whole}} new sound and that the new songs are not just a rehash of what fans heard on her last album. [...] "She broke onto the scene so hard with the last record— to have that many songs on the charts is impressive. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> smartest thing she's doing is not trying to emulate what she did but move forward", Timberlake explained. In February 2010, Rihanna admitted that [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] was inspired by her difficult relationship with ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, [...] "It's a song that everybody wanted to hear, everything that I didn't say for the past eight months, exactly how I felt about that relationship and how I feel about it now– that song says it all." [...] When asked what the most important song from the album to her was, she stated that she doesn't have one, however, Rihanna cited [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] together with [...] "Fire Bomb" [...] as her favorites.|$|E

500|$|Furthermore, in 2013 Michael Cragg of The Guardian {{pointed out}} that [...] "two decades after its release, the Icelandic artist's first album has never sounded more relevant." [...] He argued that Debut [...] "reconstructed pop music", also writing that [...] "while pop in 2013 looks {{back to the early}} 90s for inspiration, Björk's ability on Debut to {{innovate}} by using disparate genres without losing a sense of her own identity should be the blueprint for any new artist with desires to break the mould." [...] In the album's entry in their list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time" [...] —where the album was included at number 46—, NME claimed that [...] "Debut achieved the remarkable feat of turning an idiosyncratic vocalist from a feted cult band into a significant global pop star, without losing one iota of the experimental mindset and creative cool that made her so special." [...] In 2005, Björk stated that she thought the album wasn't as strong as her later efforts: [...] "It's hard to judge yourself but I don't think [...] my best. Debut was the album that went the highest up there in terms of what is 'Bjork music'. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> persona I created, which was entirely accidental, is better captured on the later albums".|$|E
500|$|Tom {{establishes}} {{that the}} island has {{some control over}} whether characters can die, as demonstrated when Michael unsuccessfully attempts to commit suicide three times. Kitsis thought that [...] "It was interesting what [...] said to Michael … that really carries through Michael's arc." [...] Later in the season, Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) tries to shoot Michael in the head, but the gun jams and the next day, {{a manifestation of the}} island in the form of Christian Shephard (John Terry) appears before Michael. Damon Lindelof confirmed that the island's [...] "cosmic intervention of fate" [...] also played a part in the car crash that foiled Jack's suicide attempt in the third-season finale. Following the broadcast of the fourth midseason premiere, Lindelof further confirmed that this island force prevents Ben and Widmore from dying. Cuse has said that [...] "There is a raging debate on the show about what constitutes free will and what constitutes destiny and Michael's story was sort of a argument on the destiny side of that equation. He had more destiny to fulfil with that island than he anticipated and maybe the audience anticipated." [...] Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that [...] "the island doesn't let you go until it's done with you and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rest of our characters are going to feel the reverberations of that, as well." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club was positive towards the episode {{and gave it}} an A. He applauded {{the fact that it}} [...] "lets Scully be flawed" [...] and allowed her to be [...] "far more human" [...] than usual on the show. Handlen concluded that the episode was a success because it illustrated [...] "the way our need to connect with others makes us vulnerable". He was, however, critical of Mulder's actions in the episode, calling him a [...] "spoiled ass" [...] and noted that there was a [...] "little boy ignored feel to his dialogue at the end". John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode a 7 out of 10 and called it [...] "one of the best character studies of the entire series". He concluded that [...] "Much of Scully’s underlying psychology is explored in this episode, and in keeping with what has been revealed about Mulder, it’s not pretty. The final act doesn’t quite match the intensity of the third, but it’s rather clear what the writers were trying to convey." [...] Meghan Deans from Tor.com wrote positively of the episode and noted that [...] "t is fortunate, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Super Bowl forced the change in sequence." [...] She argued that, had “Leonard Betts” not aired before [...] "Never Again", the audience would have been forced to [...] "read her actions as reactions to Mulder and Mulder alone" [...] rather than against the fact that she has cancer.|$|E

2500|$|Grohl stated {{this song}} was, [...] "Just another pop song. It {{was the one}} song that nobody wanted {{to put on the}} record, but it's my {{favourite}} song. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only reason it ended up on the record was that I re-did the drum track to make it sound like 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love' by Queen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before the jurors' verdict, David said to CNN {{that she}} {{believed}} in the innocence of her client. She repeated that Littlejohn was framed and another man was a likely suspect, saying: [...] "He was a convenient scapegoat who has a long criminal record". [...] Afterward, David said: [...] "We're going to appeal. We're disappointed. I'm hoping this gives {{the family of the}} victim some closure. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wrong man was convicted." ...|$|E
