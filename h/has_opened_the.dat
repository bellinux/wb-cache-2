5|$|Although {{psychodrama}} is {{not widely}} practiced, {{the work done}} by practitioners of psychodrama <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> doors to research possibilities for other psychological concepts such as group therapy and expansion {{of the work of}} Sigmund Freud. The growing field of drama therapy utilizes psychodrama as one of its main elements. The methods of psychodrama are also used by group therapy organizations and also find a place in other types of therapy, such as post-divorce counseling for children.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin is {{also known}} to be fluorescent. This has often been used to {{characterize}} doxorubicin concentrations, and <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> possibility of using the molecule as a theranostic agent. However, there are significant limitations, as doxorubicin's fluorescence spectrum is known to depend {{on a variety of}} factors, including the pH of the environment, solvent dielectric constant and others. Doxorubicin fluorescence is quenched by binding to DNA, and shielded by micelle encapsulation. It {{is also known}} to self-quench at high concentrations. In contrast, histone binding amplifies fluorescence.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for the party, {{the reunification}} of worlds <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> {{pathways}} to ancient sites where weapons and powers used to quell Enuo's rise a thousand years past lay in wait. So armed, the party enters the Rift, seeking out Exdeath {{at the center of}} the inter-dimensional nexus where they, too, fall prey to the Void. With help from their fallen allies, the party survives and is returned before Exdeath, now manifested as a demonic sylvan, battling him until he weakens and is swallowed by his own power. He then transforms into Neo Exdeath, intent on destroying the very essence of reality, himself with it. Exdeath is ultimately defeated, and, using the power of the Crystal shards, the heroes seal the Void once more and restore the reunified world and its Crystals. The game's ending varies based on how many party members are still alive at Neo Exdeath's defeat, detailing the events after the world's resurrection. At the end, the remaining group visits the Guardian Tree, and find that the fallen party members have returned to life.|$|E

5|$|The Hero is then {{reunited with}} Amanda, an escapee from his prison, who steals the pendant {{in order to}} win her brother Lester's freedom. The mayor of Jadd, Davias, takes the pendant but {{transforms}} Lester into a parrot. The Hero and Amanda confront a Medusa for its tear which will break the spell. They kill it but Amanda is infected by the Medusa's attack causing her to transform into one. The Hero reluctantly kills her and uses her tears to break Lester's spell. Lester avenges Amanda's death by killing Davias who reveals he gave the pendant to the Dark Lord. The Hero confronts and defeats the Dark Lord; however, Hero discovers that the Heroine is under Julius' mind control and <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> entrance to the Mana Tree. Julius reveals he is the last survivor of the Vandole empire, the empire who attempted to control the Mana Tree years ago, and handily defeats the Hero.|$|E

The MIA is a region where irrigation <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> way to a diversity of enterprise, from the growing of rice and other cereals under irrigation {{to the production of}} citrus, wine grapes, potatoes, and increasingly, cotton.|$|E
25|$|The area {{surrounding}} the mountain is a biosphere reserve, {{as one of}} the last remnants of the primeval forests of the Saint-Lawrence valley. Most of the mountain is currently the property of McGill University, as the Gault Nature Reserve.

25|$|In Wales where 'zero-carbon homes' are the {{aspiration}} for 2011 (although 2012 is more likely) the requirements are for Code for Sustainable Homes or equivalent. This <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> doors for standards like Passiv Haus and the CarbonLite programme. Another lesser known building type {{that does not}} rely on airtightness {{in order to get}} its energy rating is Bio-Solar-Haus. This is not a well known type of house, but it has a range of positive advantages like it is built out of renewable resources and it is a breathable structure thus making it much healthier to live in.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century, {{the city}} was witness to a flourishing {{architectural}} development, including {{the birth of a}} new architectural style later dubbed Ponce Creole. Architects like Francisco Valls, Manuel Víctor Domenech, Eduardo Salich, Blas Silva Boucher, Agustín Camilo González, Alfredo Wiechers, Francisco Porrata Doria and Francisco Gardón Vega used a mixture of Art Nouveau and neoclassic styles to give the city a unique look. This {{can be seen in the}} various structures located in the center of the city like the Teatro La Perla. To showcase its rich architectural heritage, the city <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> Museum of Puerto Rican Architecture at the Wiechers-Villaronga residence.|$|E
25|$|Educational {{psychology}}, {{as much as}} {{any other}} field of psychology heavily relies on a balance of pure observation and quantitative methods in psychology. The study of education generally combines the studies of history, sociology, and ethics with theoretical approaches. Smeyers and Depaepe explain that historically, the study of education and child rearing have been associated with the interests of policymakers and practitioners within the educational field, however, the recent shift to sociology and psychology <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> door for new findings in education as a social science. Now being its own academic discipline, educational psychology has proven to be helpful for social science researchers.|$|E

25|$|Global {{climate change}} <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> {{waters of the}} Arctic along the {{northern}} shores of Alaska, Russia and Canada. The region is rich in natural resources. Countries abutting the Arctic Ocean have shown greater military patrol activity. The Military Times reported in 2015 that Russia had reactivated ten military bases, had increased surface ship and aircraft patrols of its Northern Fleet, and had conducted missile tests in the region. The US Navy plans to have sufficient assets by 2030 to respond militarily in the Arctic. As of 2015, it conducted regular submarine patrols, but few air or surface ship operations. Russia had twelve ice breakers versus two for the US. As of 2013, Canada had six ice breakers. In 2016, Canada announced the building of five ice-breaking Arctic and offshore patrol ships.|$|E
25|$|Farther east {{the terrain}} changes {{abruptly}} {{to the flat}} lowlands of the coastal plain. This area, about sixty kilometers wide, is generally featureless and covered with gravel or sand. In the north is the Ad Dibdibah graveled plain and in the south the 'Al Jafurah sand desert, which reaches the gulf near Dhahran and merges with the Rub al Khali at its southern end. The coast itself is extremely irregular, merging sandy plains, marshes, and salt flats almost imperceptibly with the sea. As a result, the land surface is unstable; in places water rises almost to the surface, and the sea is shallow, with shoals and reefs extending far offshore. Only the construction of long moles at Ras Tanura <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> Saudi coast on the gulf to seagoing tankers.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of photography {{and more recently}} the video camera <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> art of capturing images of people and scenes at a relatively low cost to the true amateur. A person can now capture images in {{both public and private}} situations. A feature of most private photographs and videos is that they are not intended for viewing outside of a very limited range of people, and seldom if ever by the general public. Amateur photography, which includes nude photography, which has previously been produced for personal enjoyment, is increasingly being more widely disseminated through the internet, at times without the knowledge and consent of the subject of the photograph, and to their subsequent embarrassment. Also, the use of secret photography to capture images of an unsuspecting person (undressed or not, and whether for personal use, or intended for posting on the Internet) creates additional personal privacy issues.|$|E

500|$|Kohli is a {{naturally}} aggressive batsman with strong technical skills. He usually bats in the middle-order, but, on many occasions, <b>has</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> innings as well. He bats {{with a slightly}} open-chested stance and a strong bottom-hand grip, and {{is said to have}} quick footwork. He is known for his wide range of shots, ability to pace an innings and batting under pressure. He is strong through the mid-wicket and cover region. He has said that the cover drive is his favourite shot, while also saying that the flick shot comes naturally to him. He does not play the sweep shot often, being called [...] "not a natural sweeper of the cricket ball". His teammates have praised his confidence, commitment, focus and work ethics. Kohli is also known to be a [...] "sharp" [...] fielder.|$|E
