5|$|The {{matching}} rules {{can be described}} in several ways. One approach is to color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices. Another <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in green and red) to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.|$|E
5|$|Box {{lacrosse}}, {{also known}} as indoor lacrosse and sometimes shortened to boxla or simply box, is an indoor version of lacrosse played mostly in North America. The game originated in Canada, where {{it is the most}} popular version of the game played in contrast to the traditional field lacrosse game. It is played between two teams of five players and one goalie each, and is traditionally played on an ice hockey rink once the ice has been removed or covered. The playing area is called a box, in contrast to the open playing field of field lacrosse. The object of the game <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> long handled racket, known as a lacrosse stick, to catch, carry, and pass the ball in an effort to score by ultimately hurling a solid rubber lacrosse ball into an opponent's goal.|$|E

It was released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One in October 2015 and to iOS devices including Apple TV in November 2015. As with previous games in the series, the goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> special guitar controller to match fret patterns displayed on a scrolling note pattern on screen {{in time with the}} music.|$|E

30|$|An {{external}} low gain {{loop antenna}} <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> provide <b>an</b> attenuated {{version of the}} signal for synchronous detection.

25|$|An {{alternate}} option <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> wetland system, {{such as that}} of Veta la Palma in Spain.|$|E
25|$|By far {{the most}} common {{approach}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> HTTP+HTML form-based authentication cleartext protocol, or more rarely Basic access authentication.|$|E
25|$|Another {{convention}} {{used by a}} few authors <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> majuscule (capital/upper-case) {{first letter}} along with a 1 superscript, e.g., , , , etc., which avoids confusing them with the multiplicative inverse, which should be represented by , , etc.|$|E
30|$|One {{solution}} to this problem might <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> different heat extraction scheme. An example of an alternative scheme is considered below.|$|R

25|$|For back-country campers, hanging food between {{trees at}} a height {{unreachable}} to bears {{is a common}} procedure, although some grizzlies can climb and reach hanging food in other ways. An alternative to hanging food <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> bear canister.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{another option}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> compose key (hardware-based or software-emulated). Pressing the compose key, then ~, and then n results in ñ. A capital N can be {{substituted}} to produce Ñ, {{and in most cases}} the order of ~ and n can be reversed.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} {{to the issue of}} fretting <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> metal based anti-seize lubricant; being composed of assorted mixtures of aluminium, copper, graphite and nickel powders in a grease base – that allows repeated assembly and disassembly without wear and the elimination of fretting corrosion during use.|$|E
50|$|A {{slightly}} different approach <b>to</b> vertical landing <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>an</b> autogyro or helicopter rotor. This requires perhaps 2-3% {{of the landing}} weight for the rotor.|$|R
25|$|A {{method of}} {{significantly}} reducing the local oscillator {{radiation from the}} receiver's antenna <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>an</b> RF amplifier between the receiver's antenna and its mixer stage.|$|R
25|$|Another {{approach}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>an</b> interior point {{method that}} <b>uses</b> Newton-like iterations <b>to</b> {{find a solution}} of the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions of the primal and dual problems.|$|R
25|$|An {{alternate}} and complementary {{approach to}} achieve the similar effect as grid energy storage <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> smart grid communication infrastructure to enable Demand response. These technologies shift electricity consumption and electricity production from one time (when it's not useful) to another (when it's in demand).|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} tests {{can be used to}} detect the {{presence}} of a peroxide in an ether; one <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> combination of iron(II) sulfate and potassium thiocyanate. The peroxide is able to oxidize the Fe2+ ion to an Fe3+ ion, which then forms a deep-red coordination complex with the thiocyanate.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} {{way to control}} the harmonic current <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> filter that passes current only at line frequency (50 or 60Hz). The filter consists of capacitors or inductors, and makes a non-linear device {{look more like a}} linear load. An example of passive PFC is a valley-fill circuit.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} to chaindrive <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> synchronous belt.

25|$|An {{important}} component {{to the analysis}} of data used to determine {{the age of the universe}} (e.g. from Planck) therefore <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> Bayesian statistical analysis, which normalizes the results based upon the priors (i.e. the model). This quantifies any uncertainty in the accuracy of a measurement due to a particular model used.|$|E
25|$|One {{solution}} {{to the issue of}} fretting <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> metal based anti-seize lubricant between the mating parts.

50|$|Another {{style of}} quoting <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>an</b> em-dash <b>to</b> open a quote; this <b>is</b> <b>used</b> almost {{exclusively}} <b>to</b> quote dialogues, and is virtually the only convention used in works of fiction.|$|R

25|$|In {{positions}} {{with one or}} more rooks on the board and where one or both players have one or both castling rights, a castling signature may be added to indicate which castling rights exist.

25|$|Although only a {{catalytic}} {{amount of}} base {{is required in}} some cases, the more usual procedure <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> stoichiometric amount of a strong base such as LDA or NaHMDS. In this case, enolate formation is irreversible, and the aldol product is not formed until the metal alkoxide of the aldol product is protonated in a separate workup step.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the ways}} to {{automate}} processes is to develop or purchase an application that executes the required steps of the process; however, in practice, these applications rarely execute all the steps of the process accurately or completely.

30|$|Other {{approach}} {{for this type}} of constraining would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> separate constraining language such as OCL. Such approach would be more portable. However, for our prototyping purposes the tool-specific constraining is sufficient.|$|R
