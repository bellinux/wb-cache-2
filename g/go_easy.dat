500|$|Following Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na, Khan {{starred in}} Sanjay Gadhvi's thriller Kidnap. He was cast as Kabir Sharma, a {{kidnapper}} who abducts {{a girl to}} settle an old score with her father, played by Minissha Lamba and Sanjay Dutt, respectively. The actor was initially hesitant to play the part (calling it [...] "tricky and tough") because he couldn't relate to the character; according to him, {{he would not have}} been able to do it without Gadhvi's support and backing. In preparation for his role, Khan listened to metal and rock music for a year to become aggressive. While the film was a critical failure, his performance was generally well received by critics. Gaurav Malani, in a review for The Economic Times, wrote: [...] "Imran Khan is effective as the intelligent abductor who's always two steps ahead of his opponent. However, the natural actor could <b>go</b> <b>easy</b> on his lip movements that appear synthetic at times." [...] Kidnap was also a commercial failure.|$|E

When Johnson declared his intent to become a wrestler, his father initially resisted, but then agreed to train him himself, warning {{that he would not}} <b>go</b> <b>easy</b> on him. Veteran wrestler Pat Patterson got Johnson several tryout matches with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1996. Under his real name, he defeated The Brooklyn Brawler at a house show and lost the other matches to Chris Candido and Owen Hart. After wrestling at Jerry Lawler's United States Wrestling Association as Flex Kavana and winning the USWA World Tag Team Championship twice with Bart Sawyer in the summer of 1996, Johnson signed a WWF contract. He received additional training from Tom Prichard, alongside Achim Albrecht and Mark Henry.|$|E
500|$|On the [...] "EC" [...] set {{the next}} morning a {{reluctant}} Wendy joins a gray side-burned Cartman who promises he will stick to school-related questions and <b>go</b> <b>easy</b> on her. However, as soon as filming begins, he immediately asks about her rumoured promiscuity and involvement in the Smurf genocide. To Cartman's surprise, Wendy claims she indeed bulldozed Smurfland to get the valuable Smurfberries, but alludes that Cartman was involved with the plot, and that the Smurfs would have left Smurfland if Cartman had not integrated himself with them. She steps down as student body president, turning the title over to Cartman, and announces her own new book [...] on the Smurfs. Cartman is angry that she has turned the tables on him and stolen his Smurf idea, particularly when she announces she sold the movie rights to director James Cameron, who turned the book into his new film, Avatar. With being the student body president, Cartman can't do the morning announcements anymore because a student can't hold both positions at the same time. Cartman, much to his anger, also learns that being the student body president is a meaningless position with no real power. The episode ends with Casey Miller reading the announcements, which include a student's explicit letter of disgust for Cartman's performance as president, causing him to run out the room crying, [...] "I'm doing the best I can!" ...|$|E

Steffens rewrote the article from scratch, adding all of the details Wetmore had left out; Wetmore, in turn, insisted that Steffens sign the article as well, so that he too would be targeted when St. Louis citizens accused them of slander.|$|R

In an effort to warm up to each other they made small talk about their respective record deals with Interscope. By the end of the session, Gaga had created five different hooks for [...] "Chillin" [...] and added her vocals on the track. The rapper added, [...] "It took a while. Once we finally got the ball rolling, it was almost time to go. It was natural though. It's wack when you get in the studio with somebody and it's automatically music time— it feels fake.

500|$|Werner Erhard and his est Training {{programs}} and later The Forum have been parodied in films, both directly and through more subtle references. [...] Still in other films {{that did not}} directly intend to parody the subject matter, other reviewers have found elements of the est movement as applied to the genre of fictional self-help films. [...] The 1977 movie Semi-Tough, starring Burt Reynolds, parodied the est training. [...] Bert Convy played [...] "Friedrich Bismark," [...] a caricature of Werner Erhard. [...] Bismark's organization and its training went by the name [...] "B.E.A.T.", which stands for: [...] "Bismark Earthwalk Action Training." [...] In real life, Erhard had a Mercedes Benz with a llicense plate that said [...] "SO WHUT", in the film, Bismark rode in a limousine that said: [...] "BEAT IT". A form of Rolfing was also parodied in the film, and Lotte Lenya's character [...] "Clara Pelf", called PELFING", was described as: [...] "a Rolf like masseuse." [...] The press caught on to this satire of Erhard in the film, and gave these sections of the film positive reviews. [...] The Wall Street Journal did not give an overall positive review, but did appreciate the portions where Werner Erhard was parodied: [...] "The movie isn't much - an erratic ramble - But it has some pleasant moments, and a delicious send-up of The self-improvement guru Werner Erhard." [...] The Charlotte Observer praised Bert Convy's portrayal of the self-help guru Frederick Bismark, writing: [...] "Bert Convy is a hilariously smug consciousness-raiser with a more than passing resemblance to EST's Werner Erhard." [...] After the film's release, Bert Convy appeared on The Tonight Show and discussed his experiences when he attended an est training seminar in preparation {{for his role as}} Frederick Bismark. [...] During actual filming on Semi-Tough, Convy received a late-night phone call from actress Valerie Harper, known in Hollywood as a devoted student of Werner Erhard. [...] She related to Convy that Erhard was [...] "pleased" [...] with the role, and she wished him success in the film. [...] However, Convy suspected that her real reason for calling was to subtly pressure him to <b>go</b> <b>easy</b> on his parody of Erhard in the film. However, several EST graduates shunned the film for making fun of the training, its methods, its philosophy, as well as Werner Erhard, himself.|$|E

Guthrie led away at number 1 while Stanley Woods starting at number 30 had a 15-minute wait. By the last lap, Guthrie had built up a lead of 26 seconds. As the Moto Guzzi pit-attendants made preparations for Stanley Woods to refuel on the last lap, the Norton pit-crew signalled to Guthrie to <b>go</b> <b>easy</b> the pace on the last lap. Stanley Woods riding for Moto Guzzi went straight through the TT Grandstand area without stopping on the last lap and set a new overall lap record of 26minutes and 10 seconds at an average speed of 86.53mph. Despite the Norton team telephoning the signal-station at Ramsey on the last lap to indicate to Guthrie to speed up the pace, Stanley Woods won the race by 4 seconds from Guthrie in 3hours, 7minutes and 10 seconds at an average speed of 84.68mph.

2500|$|After Semi-Toughs {{release in}} 1977, Bert Convy was {{contacted}} {{by a number}} of est followers, as well as by Werner Erhard.

2500|$|Similarly, she {{was shown}} to be {{unsuccessful}} in relationships, falling for unsuitable men who ended up hurting her and settling in a “secure but uninspired” marriage to a mismatched, immature partner, Barry Evans. She was frequently shown to feel constrained and trapped by her marriage and motherhood – her initial reluctance {{to be a mother}} stemming from her own unhappy childhood. [...] Though the character occasionally showed “a rare flash of spirit”, the results were usually detrimental – an affair with her “first true love”, Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen), ended the character’s marriage and left her to face “a dreary future as a single mother.” [...] Lucy Speed has commented on her character’s personality: “she's a thinker and quite vulnerable, but she's grown up a lot. She's also had storylines where she's dealt with family skeletons and she did find a man who was able to give her stability and the chance for her to grow up a bit. Ultimately though, I hope that I've shown that who she is now explains who she was then…she's gone from being a young girl with zero confidence in herself to a young woman with a certain measure of confidence, back to someone with zero confidence.

2500|$|The former {{trend in}} Disney's {{hand-drawn}} features where {{the characters and}} cinematography were influenced by a CGI-look has been abandoned. Andreas Deja, a veteran Disney animator who supervised the character of Mama Odie, says [...] "I always thought that maybe we should distinguish ourselves {{to go back to}} what 2D is good at, which is focusing on what the line can do rather than volume, which is a CG kind of thing. So we are doing less extravagant Treasure Planet kind of treatments. You have to create a world but [...] What we're trying to do with Princess and the Frog is hook up with things that the old guys did earlier. It's not going to be graphic...". Deja also mentions that Lasseter was aiming for the Disney sculptural and dimensional look of the 1950s: [...] "All those things that were non-graphic, which means <b>go</b> <b>easy</b> on the straight lines and have one volume flow into the other– an organic feel to the drawing." [...] Lasseter also felt that traditional animation created more character believability. For example, with Louis the alligator, created by Eric Goldberg, Lasseter said: [...] "It's the believability of this large character being able to move around quite like that." [...] Choreographer Betsy Baytos was brought by the directors to lead a team of eccentric dancers that gave reference to make each character a different style of movement. The character design tried to create beautiful drawings through subtle shapes, particularly for most characters being human. For the frog versions of Tiana and Naveen, while the animators started with realistic designs, they eventually went for cutesy characters [...] "removing all that is unappealing in frogs", similar to Pinocchios Jiminy Cricket.|$|E
2500|$|Ian Chappell {{came from}} a South Australian cricket dynasty, his {{maternal}} grandfather Vic Richardson had been captain of Australia and his younger brothers Greg and Trevor Chappell also played for Australia. In the 1960s the young Ian Chappell had been noted as an aggressive batsman and gifted slip fielder who played for South Australia when only 18 and Australia when 21. He was not an immediate success with the bat, he made only one century in his first 17 Tests, but kept his place due to some extraordinary slip catches and his ability as a part-time leg-spinner. He ended his run-drought with 548 runs (68.50) against the West Indies in 1968–69. He {{was known as a}} man who could make runs when Australia were under pressure, and some thought he was a better batsman than his gifted brother Greg for this reason. Despite a poor tour of South Africa in 1969–70 Chappell was made Bill Lawry's vice-captain in the 1970–71 Ashes series. Lawry's defensive tactics earned him few friends and when Australia went into the last Test needing a victory to retain the Ashes he was controversially replaced by the aggressive Chappell, who had already made two centuries in the series. Chappell won the toss, put England in to bat and Australia had a 100 run lead in the first innings, but Ray Illingworth's team fought back to win the Test and the series. Nevertheless Chappell was made captain for the 1972 Ashes series and his young team surprised Illingworth’s veterans by halving the series 2–2. He now had young talent in the shape of Rod Marsh, Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee, Bob Massie, Ross Edwards, Max Walker and Jeff Thomson and moulded them into a tough, combative team that dominated the mid-1970s; they beat Pakistan 3–0 and the West Indies 2–0 in 1972–73, New Zealand 2–0 in 1973–74, England 4–1 in 1974–75 and 1–0 in 1975. This success was not without its price as the Ugly Australians won few prizes for sportsmanship, with Chappell demanding 100% commitment from his players, and winning at all costs. In the 1975 Cricket World Cup Australia made 328/5 against Sri Lanka and Chappell told his team to <b>go</b> <b>easy</b> as the newcomers could not possibly win and he wanted to improve their image, but he reversed his decision when they reached 70/1. As a result Sidath Wettimuny was carried off the field after being hit three times by Jeff Thomson, the 5'2" [...] Duleep Mendis retired hurt after being hit between the eyes by a bouncer and Australia won by 52 runs. In 1975–76 he passed on the Australian captaincy to his brother Greg, but stayed in the team as they beat Clive Lloyd's West Indians 5–1. He was instrumental in the creation of Kerry Packer's professional World Series Cricket to rival the Australian Board of Control and improve the financial lot of Australian cricketers and captained the WSC Australia XI. When Packer and the ABC came to a deal Chappell returned to Test cricket against England the West Indies in 1979–80 before finally retiring.|$|E
