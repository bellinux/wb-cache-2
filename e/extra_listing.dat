50|$|In the 1999 election, Blincoe {{missed out}} on a seat, as a list {{candidate}} under mixed-member proportional (MMP) representation, by a narrow margin once special votes had been counted. Initially it appeared that Blincoe would have a seat in Parliament, {{as well as a}} party member directly following him on the Labour party's list. With the counting of special votes, however, the Green Party crossed the minimum 5% threshold of votes and received an electorate MP, which in turn allowed them to have seats in Parliament. In addition, Winston Peters won the constituency seat of Tauranga by a narrow margin of sixty-two votes over a National Party candidate, and this enabled his New Zealand First party to acquire <b>extra</b> <b>list</b> seats in Parliament.|$|R

Analyses of variance, with specified contrasts, found the DAT patients to demonstrate a pervasive memory impairment affecting both the qualitative and quantitative memory indices compared to depressed and normal elderly.

5000|$|Thanks to rumours {{that one}} {{or all of the}} Beatles would be joining him on stage, Dylan's {{comeback}} show had become, in the words of music journalist John Harris, [...] "inflated into the gig of the decade". On 31 August, a nervous Dylan arrived on stage in a cream suit recalling Hank Williams, with a haircut and a short beard. Backed by the Band, he performed recent pieces from his Nashville Skyline and John Wesley Harding albums, as well as countryfied versions of earlier songs such as [...] "Maggie's Farm", [...] "Highway 61 Revisited" [...] and [...] "Like a Rolling Stone". The contrast in musical style between this performance and his 1966 concerts led to surprise and consternation among both the festival crowd and the throng of international journalists who had descended on the island to cover the event. Levon Helm of the Band later commented: [...] "Bob had an <b>extra</b> <b>list</b> of songs with about eight or ten different titles ... that we would've gone ahead and done had it seemed like the right thing to do.

5000|$|Allow the {{overhang}} [...] - [...] A {{party is}} allowed to keep any overhang seats it wins, but other parties are still awarded {{the same number of}} seats that they are entitled to. This means that a party with overhang seats has more seats than its entitlement. Other parties may be given additional list seats (sometimes called [...] "balance seats" [...] or leveling seats) in order that they are not disadvantaged. This preserves the same ratio between parties as was established in the election. It also increases the size of the legislature, as overhang seats are added, and there may also be <b>extra</b> <b>list</b> seats added to counteract them. This system results is less proportional than full compensation, as the party with the overhang is still receiving a [...] "bonus" [...] above its proportional entitlement. The number of extra seats that may be created is sometimes limited to avoid an excessive increase {{in the size of the}} assembly, which approaches the second option. The New Zealand Parliament uses this system (without [...] "balance seats"); one extra seat was added in the 2005 election and 2011 election, and two extra seats in the 2008 election. This system was also used in the German Bundestag (also without [...] "balance seats") until 2013.|$|R

50|$|Similarly, in New Zealand, {{some voters}} who {{preferred}} a large party {{have voted for}} the minor party's local candidate to ensure it qualifies for list seats {{on the back of}} winning a single electorate. This notably occurred in the right-wing inner Auckland electorate of Epsom in 2008 and 2011, where the National Party voters gave their local vote to the ACT Party. In this case the tactic maintained some proportionality by bypassing the 5% threshold, but is largely disfavoured by the public due to it awarding smaller parties <b>extra</b> <b>list</b> seats while parties with a higher party vote percentage that don't win an electorate receive no seats; this occurred in 2008 when ACT was awarded 5 seats on the back of one electorate seat and 3.7% of the party vote, while New Zealand First with no electorate seats and 4.1% of the party vote were awarded none. In 2011, some Epsom voters voting for the left-wing Labour and Green parties tried to block the tactic by giving their local vote to the National candidate; while it was unsuccessful, it did reduce ACT's majority over National from 12,900 to 2,300. In August 2012, the initial report on a review of the MMP system by the Electoral Commission recommended abolishing the one electorate seat threshold, meaning a party winning an electorate seat but not crossing the 5% threshold (which the same report recommends lowering to 4%) is only awarded that electorate seat.|$|R
50|$|To {{follow up}} this study, Roediger and McDermott {{conducted}} a second experiment that allowed better experimental control. This time they created <b>extra</b> <b>lists</b> {{similar to those}} used by Deese, except the new lists had 15 items instead of 12 and the design was manipulated in a few minor ways. The major difference in this second experiment was the inclusion of a ‘remember-know’ judgement task. This task is applied to a recognition test in order to determine whether subjects recognise an item based on their memory, or based on familiarity. Subjects are first asked if an item is one they have seen before (old) or one that they have not (new), then for items that they have classified as 'old', subjects are asked to judge if they can mentally relive the experience of the item being presented (remember), or if they are confident that it occurred without having a memory for the event (know). Roediger and McDermott predicted that subjects were recalling a nonpresented word because of a high sense of familiarity induced through the presented lists, and as such they would predominantly judge ‘old’ critical lures as being ‘known’ rather than ‘remembered’. Interestingly, this prediction was not supported. The second experiment showed an increase in recall of the nonpresented critical lures (to a level marginally significantly greater than actually presented words), which was paired with 72% of recognised critical lures being judged as ‘remembered’. These results show clear evidence of subjects ‘remembering’ events that never occurred.|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes an {{augmented}} {{electric field}} integral equation (A-EFIE) for layered medium Green's function. The newly developed matrix-friendly formulation of layered medium Green's function is applied in this method. By separating charge as <b>extra</b> unknown <b>list,</b> and enforcing the current continuity equation, the traditional EFIE can be cast into a generalized saddle-point system. Frequency scaling for the matrix-friendly formulation is analyzed when frequency tends to zero.

We describe the impact on surgical delay following the introduction of an orthogeriatrician {{and the addition of}} one <b>extra</b> trauma <b>list</b> per week at our centre.

Mean time to surgery in cohorts 1 and 2 was 4. 08 and 4. 05  days, respectively (p[*]=[*] 0. 71). Diagnosis of medical comorbidity increased with input from the orthogeriatrician from 69. 7 % to 74. 2 % (p[*]=[*] 0. 24). Length of stay and mortality were comparable in the two groups. A full trauma list accounted for the most frequent orthopaedic delay, which decreased from 18. 1 % to 12. 9 % (p[*]=[*] 0. 09). Increased recognition of medical comorbidity has financial implications for hospital remuneration. However, lack of orthopaedic provisions accounts for significant avoidable surgical delay requiring further investment if national standards are to be achieved...|$|R
