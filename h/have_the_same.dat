5|$|A {{homophonic}} texture may be homorhythmic, {{which means}} that all parts <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> rhythm. Chorale texture is another variant of homophony. The {{most common type of}} homophony is melody-dominated homophony, in which one voice, often the highest, plays a distinct melody, and the accompanying voices work together to articulate an underlying harmony.|$|E
5|$|Almost all large wind {{turbines}} <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> design— a {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} having an upwind rotor with three blades, {{attached to a}} nacelle on top of a tall tubular tower.|$|E

5|$|Blackcherry is {{a limited}} edition trim, {{available}} in the UK since November 2010 {{and based on the}} VTR+. It was sold with the 1.6-litre High-pressure Direct Injection (HDi) diesel engine. It was discontinued and replaced with the Code Red and Code White in January 2012, which <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> engine.|$|E
5|$|CR106 {{begins at}} the Orange County line in Harriman State Park as a {{continuation}} of that county's CR106. The route {{is only one of}} two county routes that <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> number in both Rockland and Orange counties; the other is CR72.|$|E
5|$|For {{all above}} {{mentioned}} X-ray diffraction methods, the scattering is elastic; the scattered X-rays <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> wavelength as the incoming X-ray. By contrast, inelastic X-ray scattering methods {{are useful in}} studying excitations of the sample, rather than the distribution of its atoms.|$|E
25|$|In The King of Fighters 2002, Kusanagi and K9999 have an Akira-esque intro {{before they}} fight, since Kusanagi <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> voice as Kaneda and K9999 <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> voice as Tetsuo.|$|R
50|$|It <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> basic case {{design as}} the Premium Edition drives, {{including}} the capacity gauge, except {{the color of}} the World Edition is white. It <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> Morse code ventilation as the other editions.|$|R
50|$|Every {{reactive}} unit <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> reactivity {{regardless of}} other factors. For example, a reactive group A on a 20-mer (a polymer with 20 monomer units) <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> reactivity as another group A on a 2000-mer.|$|R
5|$|In 2011, {{researchers}} reported that adding {{large amounts of}} zinc to a urine sample masked detection of drugs. The researchers did not test whether orally consuming a zinc dietary supplement could <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|Marsh Tackies <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> ancestral bloodlines as Florida Cracker Horses and North Carolina Banker horses. However, DNA {{testing has}} {{proved that the}} Marsh Tackies' {{relative}} isolation has made them a separate breed with unique characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} the 18th century, two laws about {{chemical}} reactions emerged without referring to the notion of an atomic theory. The first was the law of conservation of mass, formulated by Antoine Lavoisier in 1789, which states that the total mass in a chemical reaction remains constant (that is, the reactants <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> mass as the products). The second was the law of definite proportions. First proven by the French chemist Joseph Louis Proust in 1799, this law states that if a compound is broken down into its constituent elements, then the masses of the constituents will always <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> proportions, regardless of the quantity or source of the original substance.|$|E
50|$|It is 2-covered by the cuboctahedron, which {{accordingly}} <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> abstract vertex figure (2 triangles and two squares: 3.4.3.4) {{and twice}} the vertices, edges, and faces. It <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> topology as <b>the</b> abstract polyhedron hemi-cuboctahedron.|$|R

5000|$|The {{spread of}} a matrix depends {{only on the}} {{spectrum}} of the matrix (its multiset of eigenvalues).

5|$|Other exotic atoms {{have been}} created by {{replacing}} one of the protons, neutrons or electrons with other particles that <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> charge. For example, an electron can {{be replaced by a}} more massive muon, forming a muonic atom. These types of atoms can be used to test the fundamental predictions of physics.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium {{is not a}} known {{nutrient}} for any living organisms. However, rubidium ions <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> charge as potassium ions, and {{are actively}} taken up and treated by animal cells in similar ways.|$|E
5|$|Shape {{has been}} {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the most critical properties for identifying members of an object category. Infants assume that objects that <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> shape also share a name. Shape plays an important role in both appropriate and inappropriate extensions.|$|E
30|$|Peg IFN {{proved to}} have {{depressive}} symptoms in chronic HCV patients by altering levels of tryptophan and phenylalanine. Also, our study proved that direct-acting antiviral (sofosbuvir) <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> side effects, as <b>the</b> two therapies <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> mechanism.|$|R
50|$|In The King of Fighters 2002, Kusanagi and K9999 have an Akira-esque intro {{before they}} fight, since Kusanagi <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> voice as Kaneda and K9999 <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> voice as Tetsuo. For more information, see Akira (1988 film).|$|R
50|$|A similar collector's edition was {{released}} in European regions, which features a special plastic ring, which <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> dimensions as a Blu-ray case. It also <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> Blu-ray disc as the North American release included in this package.|$|R
5|$|Si-vacancies {{constitute}} minor {{fraction of}} total silicon. It is believed (though no proof exists) that much silicon substitutes for carbon thus becoming invisible to most spectroscopic techniques because silicon and carbon atoms <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{configuration of the}} outer electronic shells.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo 64 {{video game}} console has {{a library of}} games, which were {{primarily}} released in plastic ROM cartridges. Two small indentations {{on the back of}} each cartridge allows it to connect or pass through the system's cartridge dustcover flaps. All regions <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> connectors, and region-locked cartridges will fit into the other regions' systems by using a cartridge converter or by simply removing the cartridge's casing. However, the systems are also equipped with lockout chips that will only allow them to play their appropriate games. Both Japanese and North American systems <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> NTSC lockout, while Europe has a PAL lockout. A bypass device such as the N64 Passport or the Datel Action Replay can be used to play import titles, but a few games require an additional boot code before they can be played.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} a real number might have two {{different}} decimal representations is merely {{a reflection of the}} fact that two different sets of real numbers can <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> supremum.|$|E
25|$|A regular graph is a graph {{in which}} each vertex <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> number of neighbours, i.e., every vertex <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> degree. A regular graph with {{vertices}} of degree k is called a k‑regular graph or regular graph of degree k.|$|R
25|$|In layman terms, any {{surface is}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> bivector, if it <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> area, same orientation, and is {{parallel}} to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> plane (see figure).|$|R
50|$|Two {{explosives}} HMX and CL-20 cocrystallized in a ratio 1:2 to form {{a hybrid}} explosive. This explosive <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> low sensitivity of HMX and nearly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> explosive power of CL-20. Physically mixing explosives creates a mixture that <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> sensitivity as <b>the</b> most sensitive component, which cocrystallisation overcomes.|$|R
5|$|The {{family of}} topological orderings of a DAG {{is the same}} as the family of linear {{extensions}} of the reachability relation for the DAG, so any two graphs representing the same partial order <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> set of topological orders.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is believed}} to have been housed in Caesarea in the 6th century, together with the Codex Sinaiticus, as they <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> unique divisions of chapters in the Acts. It came to Italy – probably from Constantinople – after the Council of Florence (1438–1445).|$|E
5|$|The mosque at Ajdabiya in Libya had {{a similar}} plan, {{although}} it did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> monumental entrance. Like the Mahdiya mosque, for the same ideological reasons, the Ajdabiya mosque {{did not have a}} minaret.|$|E
