30|$|The four chronologies {{mentioned}} above share several characteristics that {{could explain the}} patterns observed on Rincon Peak. First, all of these studies documented long fire intervals within approximately {{the same time period}} encompassing or within the LEENT. This suggests climate (e.g., ENSO variations) may have been a contributing factor for the lengthening of fire free intervals at this time. Second, these studies are all from sites with rugged topography and complex fuel arrangements, which reflects the importance of landscape <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> and fire spread. In addition, Rincon Peak and the Animas Mountains also share a stand-replacing fire component that probably affected <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity.</b> The physical similarities shared by forests with variable-fire regimes indicate that these landscapes were more susceptible to climatic changes compared to forested landscapes with gentler topography and more continuous fuels.|$|E
30|$|We {{hypothesize that}} the {{increased}} scarring rate may reflect increasing severity of {{fires in the}} late nineteenth and twentieth centuries relative to earlier periods of our record. Changes in fire severity within stands may have been related to fire suppression activities resulting in changes in <b>fuel</b> <b>continuities</b> or types in the understory of these bigcone stands. However, many experts believe that effective fire suppression in southern California did not start until the early 1950 s, which is decades after the increase in scarring prevalence that we observed (Davis and Michaelsen 1995, Moritz 1997, Keeley 1999). For example, Forest Service records indicate that within the 1932 Matilija Fire perimeter, only two lighting-started fires were suppressed in the previous 22 years (Keeley and Zedler 2009). Moreover, we lack any evidence at this time of changes in fuels within bigcone Douglas-fir stands.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Wildfires are an {{integral}} part of Mediterranean ecosystems; humans impact on landscapes imply changes in <b>fuel</b> amount and <b>continuity,</b> and thus in fire regime. We tested the hypothesis that fire regime changed in western Mediterranean Basin during the last century using time series techniques. We first compiled a 130 -yr fire history for the Valencia province (Spain, Eastern Iberian Peninsula, Western Mediterranean Basin) from contemporary statistics plus old forest administration dossiers and newspapers. We also compiled census on rural population and climatic data for the same period in order to evaluate the role of climate and human-driven fuel changes on the fire regime change. The result suggested that there was a major fire regime shift around the early 1970 s in such a way that fires increased in annual frequency (doubled) and area burned (by about an order of magnitude). The main driver of this shift was the increase in <b>fuel</b> amount and <b>continuity</b> due to rural depopulation (vegetation and fuel build-up after farm abandonment) suggesting that fires were fuel-limited during the pre- 1970 s period. Climatic conditions were poorly related to pre- 1970 s fires and strongly related to post- 1970 s fires, suggesting that fire are currently less fuel limited and more drought-driven than before the 1970 s. Thus, the fire regime shift implies also a shift in the main driver for fire activity, and this has consequences in the global change agenda...|$|R
40|$|Fire regimes (i. e., the pattern, {{frequency}} {{and intensity of}} fire in a region) reflect a complex interplay of bottom-up and topdown controls (Lertzman et al., 1998; Mc Kenzie et al., in press). Bottom-up controls include local variations in topographic, fuel and weather factors {{at the time of}} a burn (e. g., <b>fuel</b> moisture and <b>continuity,</b> ignition density and local wind and humidity patterns). Bottom-up regulation is manifest as fine-scale spatial and temporal heterogeneity in fire behavior and effects within landscapes subject to the same general climate. Examples include variation in fuel consumption, tree mortality and soil effects, which create complex burn severity legacies that can influence subsequent fires (Collins and Stephens, 2008; Scholl and Taylor, 2010) ...|$|R
30|$|Unburned patch {{density and}} mean {{unburned}} patch length were lowest in open woodlands, {{which was also}} the vegetation structure type with the highest percentage burned (in agreement with Russell-Smith et al. 2003). According to Cheney and Sullivan (2008), <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity,</b> {{the extent to which}} the surface of the ground is covered by fuel, is the main characteristic influencing fire spread. Open woodlands are dominated by flammable tall annual Sorghum spp. and perennial grasses, supplemented by scattered leaf litter that can fill bare patches in the grass sward, making for a more continuous fuel bed. On the other hand, percent burned was lowest in sandstone types and unburned patch frequency was highest, due to decreased <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> caused by a large proportion of exposed rock surfaces. Rocky surfaces and bare soil act as barriers to fire spread and discontinuous grasslands will not carry a fire until the wind speed exceeds a particular threshold (Cheney and Sullivan 2008).|$|E
30|$|The {{idea behind}} burning in moist {{conditions}} {{to generate a}} patchier burn is that the increased fuel moisture effectively reduces <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> and can increase patches of unburned areas that serve as insect refugia. <b>Fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> {{is a function of}} vegetation structure, including the horizontal and vertical spacing between patches of vegetation; in the absence of these spaces, increasing fuel moisture can effectively reduce continuity (Miller and Urban 2000) and increase burn patchiness (Knapp and Keeley 2006). This idea was not strongly supported by our results, as the optimal model for explaining the abundance of potential refugia included an interaction between dead fuel moisture and pre-burn cover of open ground. Higher dead fuel moistures only increased post-burn cover of unburned areas when the pre-burn fuel structure included higher cover of open ground (Figure 5). Without this pre-existing open ground, high fuel moistures did not reduce continuity enough to leave unburned or low-consumption areas.|$|E
30|$|Exotic grasses {{capable of}} {{increasing}} frequency {{and intensity of}} anthropogenic fire have invaded subtropical and tropical dry forests worldwide. Since many dry forest trees are susceptible to fire, this can result in decline of native species and loss of forest cover. While the contribution of exotic grasses to altered fire regimes has been well documented, the role of native grasses in contributing to fuel loads in dry forest has received little attention. We assessed differences in fuel conditions among native and exotic grasses within a subtropical dry forest preserve in Puerto Rico. We quantified fine fuel loads, <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity,</b> and seasonal changes in percent dead grass among the following grass patch types: (1) native grass with no known history of recent fire, (2) exotic grass that had burned once (single burn), and (3) exotic grass that burns frequently. Sampling was conducted during one wet season (August to October 2008) {{and again in the}} following dry season (February to March 2009). Overall, fine fuel loading was highest in native grass, but this was due to woody fuels rather than grass fuels. Percent of dead grass fuels increased with the transition from wet to dry season, and this increase was more pronounced for exotic grasses. <b>Fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> was highest in frequently burned exotic grass. Differences in grass phenology and <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> may contribute to differences in fire frequency among native and exotic grass patches. Fuel management focused on prescribed fire should be used in conjunction with restoration of tree canopy to reduce fuels and limit development of a grass-fire cycle.|$|E
30|$|The fire {{regime that}} {{characterized}} southwest Oregon interior valley chaparral prior to Euro-American settlement is uncertain, and regimes {{other than the}} high severity, moderate frequency regime we propose here may have prevailed. However, our evidence implies that chaparral within our study area probably experienced a fire regime that was distinct from the historically low or mixed severity, high frequency fires that characterized nearby conifer forests (e.g., Agee 1991, Sensenig 2002). Chaparral patches have also experienced different fire histories than the surrounding conifer matrix elsewhere (Nagel and Taylor 2005), perhaps because differences in <b>fuel</b> structure, <b>continuity,</b> and moisture prevent surface fire spread from forests to chaparral under moderate burning conditions, particularly when chaparral is young (Green 1981, Dieterich and Hibbert 1990, Cione et al. 2002, Taylor and Skinner 2003). Burning practices of early ranchers (e.g., Peterson 1916, LaLande 1995) and extensive livestock grazing {{are also likely to}} have influenced chaparral community structure and dynamics, but data to enable explicit assessment of the roles of these factors are lacking. Nonetheless, it is clear that uneven-aged structures, shrub fire survivorship, and recruitment in the absence of fire occur after the long absence of those practices.|$|R
50|$|Following Lula's second victory, his {{approval}} ratings started to rise again (<b>fueled</b> by the <b>continuity</b> of the economical and social achievements obtained {{during the first}} term) to a record of 80%, the highest for a Brazilian president {{since the end of}} the military regime. The focus of Lula's second term have been to further stimulate the economy by investments in infrastructure and measures to keep expanding the domestic credit to producers, industry, commerce and consumers alike. In 2009, Brazil's economic rise was temporarily halted by a worldwide financial crisis, forcing the government to implement a temporary Tax Relief policy in strategic segments of the economy like automobiles and construction. These measures helped the country to prevent a long term recession and ensured a quick recovery to Brazil's economic ascension.|$|R
30|$|In the Sierra Nevada of California, {{frequent}} fires historically maintained heterogeneous forest {{stands with}} high structural diversity (Knapp and Keeley 2006). The influence of fire in Sierra Nevada ecosystems {{has been reduced}} over the 20 th century due to aggressive fire suppression policies. Excluding fire from Sierra Nevada forests has altered forest structure by increasing the abundance of shade tolerant tree species (e.g. white fir) {{at the expense of}} shade intolerant but more fire resistant species (e.g. sugar pine and ponderosa pine) (Ansley and Battles 1998, Parsons and DeBenedetti 1979, Vankat and Major 1978). Fire exclusion has resulted in higher tree densities and abundant surface <b>fuels,</b> enhancing the <b>continuity</b> between surface <b>fuels</b> and live canopies (Biswell et al. 1968, van Wagtendonk 1985, Skinner and Chang 1996), and greatly increasing the risk of large, intense fires (Agee and Skinner 2005).|$|R
30|$|We also {{assessed}} {{cover of}} open ground in each sub-quadrat; this cover category represented areas of low <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> {{that could potentially}} inhibit fire spread, and included areas of bare ground, sparse litter, rock, moss, and very low-statured (< 2 cm) vegetation, with minimal overhang of neighboring vegetation. Data from the sub-quadrats were averaged to determine the total percentage of open ground in the plot.|$|E
40|$|Fires {{were a part}} of our wildlands prehistorically. Prescribed burning reduces {{fire hazard}} and {{potential}} fire behavior primarily by reducing fuel quantity and continuity. <b>Fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> should be considered on the micro scale within stands, the midscale among, and the macro-scale among watersheds or entire forests. Prescribed fire {{is only one of the}} tools which can be used to reduce fire hazard, but it can be effective at all scales...|$|E
30|$|Differences in {{phenology}} and <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> {{may contribute}} to differences in fire frequency among native and exotic grass patches. Native and exotic grasses exhibited differences in phenology during the transition from rainy to dry season. Exotic grasses, independent of species or fire history, displayed a more pronounced shift towards {{a higher proportion of}} dead grass per area during the dry season than did native grass. Furthermore, <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> was higher in exotic grass than native grass, particularly in frequently burned patches. Finally, qualitative observations of Uniola virgata patches following fire suggest that its ability to survive topkill and resprout immediately after fire is limited (J. Thaxton, personal observation). In contrast, the two exotic grasses at our sites are both extremely fire tolerant and resprout rapidly following fire (Williams and Baruch 2000). All of these factors have likely contributed to exotic grass invasion triggering a grass-fire cycle that causes substantial loss of forest cover, while the presence of native grass, even over extensive areas of the forest, {{does not appear to have}} contributed to the development of this cycle.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an operational nationwide burnt area mapping service realized over Greece for the years 2007 – 2011, through the implementation of the so-called BSM_NOA dedicated method developed at the National Observatory of Athens for post-fire recovery management. The method exploits multispectral satellite imagery, such as Landsat-TM, SPOT, FORMOSAT- 2, WorldView and IKONOS. The analysis of fire size distribution reveals that a high number of fire events evolve to large and extremely large wildfires under favorable wildfire conditions, confirming the reported trend of an increasing fire-severity in recent years. Furthermore, under such conditions wildfires affect to a higher degree areas at high altitudes, threatening the existence of ecologically significant ecosystems. Finally, recent socioeconomic changes and land abandonment has resulted in the encroachment of former agricultural areas of limited productivity by shrubs and trees, resulting both in increased <b>fuel</b> availability and <b>continuity,</b> and subsequently increased burnability...|$|R
40|$|Commercial timber {{harvesting}} typically reduces aerial <b>fuel</b> loading and <b>continuity,</b> but can actually heighten fire activity through increased surface fuel loading (Agee 1997). Fuel depth and loading, which typically increase after harvest, {{play a significant}} role in fire intensity and rate of spread in redwood forests (Sequoia sempervirens) (D. Don.) Endl.) (Nives 1989), which are significant predictors of redwood mortality (Finney and Martin 1993). However, residual slash fuels may simultaneously reduce erosion, which may be of greater importance in some areas because they intercept rainfall and soil particles dispersed by overland flow (Fernandez et al. 2004). The relationship of surface fuel loading on potential fire behavior and soil erosion was explored in coast redwood stands that were selectively harvested 11 years prior to this study by either cable- or tractor-skidding methods (Piirto et al. 1997). The objectives of this study were to (1) assess fuel loading and potential fire behavior in harvested stands and (2) determine if surface soil erosion was influenced by surface fuels...|$|R
30|$|The {{apparent}} {{importance of}} pronghorn browsing in the Warm-Dry and Shallow-Dry sagebrush groups was a surprise, having a greater {{effect on the}} mix of community phases and fire rotation than we expected. As with insect outbreaks, pronghorn browsing when animal populations were high and winters were severe would shift site resources to grass, increasing <b>fuel</b> amount and <b>continuity,</b> and subsequent fire risks. However, we are less confident that this particular interaction is {{as strong as the}} model suggests. Although pronghorn populations were much higher before 1850 (Elliott 1910, O’Gara and Yoakum 2004), they were also lower than populations east of the continental divide where the impact of high pronghorn populations during severe winters has been documented (O’Gara and Yoakum 2004). Thus, we are less certain that population peaks would have had the same effect on the Malheur High Plateau as on the western Great Plains. If we overestimated the probability of pronghorn browsing, then the Late Seral Closed community phase might have been more abundant and the Mid Seral and Late Seral Open phases less abundant in both dry sagebrush groups.|$|R

The goals of this study were to reconstruct the fire history on Rincon Peak, evaluate the influences of broad-(i.e., climate) versus local-scale (i.e., <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity)</b> factors on fire history patterns, and investigate the possibility of a variable fire regime. This study addressed the following four questions. Did previously identified long fire intervals occur across the entire mountain? What was the relationship between climate and fire extent?

30|$|Agricultural {{lands are}} also {{less prone to}} burn {{because they are more}} {{controlled}} and their temporal dynamics might interrupt <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> over time and space and thus fire spread. Similarly, at the global scale, there is low presence of forests and high proportion of grasslands in areas with high fire density (Chuvieco et al. 2008), and burned area tends to be lower with increasing proportion of cultivated lands in central Argentina (Fischer et al. 2012).|$|E

These factors may covary with the response of soil fungal communities to disturbance by fire through their influences on fuel loading and possibly other mechanisms (e.g., <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity,</b> fuel combustibility, etc.; Rothermel 1972, Scott and Burgan 2005).|$|E
40|$|Aim of study: Understanding fire {{ecology of}} main forest species is {{essential}} for a sound, scientifically based on managing of wildlands and also to assess likely implications due to changes in fire regime under a global change scenario. Few references can be found about fire ecology of Pinus uncinata Ram. (PU). PU species grows in the Central Pyrenees where large, severe wildland fires did not occur frequently in the past. However, several fires with extreme fire behavior have affected PU stands in last years and they might disturb other PU forest in the future. Area of study : Cabdella fire (February 2012), in Lleida province, {{is one of the}} several wildland fires occurred in 2012 (winter season) in the Central Pyrenees. Fire affected a large PU plantation (102 ha) located at 1. 800 - 2, 100 meters above the sea. Material and methods : We have analyzed first order fire effects in three fireline intensity thresholds along three years in terms of mortality ratio, scorched height, percentage of scorched crown volume and bark char height. Main results : PU seems to be a very tolerant species to low and medium fire line intensity but fire effects were very significant when fire line intensity was high. In medium fireline intensity sites, probability of mortality ranged from 15 to 30 % and the dead trees had the highest values on scorched height and percentage of scorched crown volume. Research highlights : Results from this work supports that prescribed burning might be used to efficiently decrease fuel load and <b>fuel</b> vertical <b>continuity</b> while avoiding considerable PU mortality. It also displayed that when fuel management has been implemented, PU mortality might be limited even under extreme fire behavior. Abbreviations used : PU: Pinus uncinata Ram. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{inferred}} climate {{effects on}} fire occurrence from 1630 to 1900 {{for a new}} set of crossdated fire-scar chronologies from 18 forested sites in Utah and one site in eastern Nevada. Years with regionally synchronous fires (31 years with fire at ≥ 20 % of sites) occurred during drier than average summers and years with no fires at any site (100 years) were wetter than average. Antecedent wet summers were associated with regional-fire years in mixed-conifer and ponderosa pine forest types, possibly by affecting fine <b>fuel</b> amount and <b>continuity.</b> NINO 3 (an index of the El Niño– Southern Oscillation, ENSO) was significantly low during regional-fire years (La Niñas) and significantly high during non-fire years (El Niños). NINO 3 also was high during years before regional-fire years. Although regional fire years occurred nearly twice as often as expected when NINO 3 and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation were both in their cool (negative) phases, this pattern was not statistically significant. Palmer Drought Severity Index was important for fire occurrence in ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests across the study area but ENSO forcing was seen only in south-eastern sites.

40|$|Removal of fire-killed trees (i. e. post-fire or salvage logging) {{is often}} {{conducted}} {{in part to}} reduce woody fuel loads and mitigate potential reburn effects. Studies of post-salvage fuel dynamics have primarily used chronosequence or modelling approaches, with associated limitations; longitudinal studies tracking fuels over time have been rare. We resampled a network of post-fire plots, comprising a range of logging intensities, 10 years after the 2002 Biscuit Fire (Oregon, USA). For surface woody fuels, which started from large treatment differences immediately following logging (stepwise increases with harvest intensity), we found converging trends among treatments at 10 years, with convergence nearly complete for fine fuels but not for coarse fuels. Fire-killed snags for the dominant species (Pseudotsuga menziesii) decayed while standing at a statistically significant rate (single-exponential k≤ 0. 011), similar to or only slightly slower than down wood, suggesting that not all snag biomass will reach the forest floor. Live vegetation (largely resprouting sclerophyllous vegetation) is beginning to dominate surface <b>fuel</b> mass and <b>continuity</b> (> 100 % cover) and likely moderates differences associated with woody fuels. Post-fire logging {{had little effect on}} live fuels or their change over time, suggesting high potential for stand-replacing early-seral fire regardless of post-fire harvest treatments...|$|R
30|$|The second term, {{weight of}} fuel consumed, is {{difficult}} to estimate, and generally requires measurement. However, reasonably precise ocular estimates {{can be made with}} some practice. The range of fuel quantity is not great in natural fuels and may range from 4.5 Mg ha− 1 to around 45 Mg ha− 1 in exceptionally heavy, long unburnt fuels. In the absence of fuel quantity measurements, yardsticks such as time since last burn, fuel depth and <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> may be used to estimate roughly fuel quantity.|$|E
30|$|Extinguishment of unsuppressed fires {{occurs as}} a result of the {{sensitive}} relationship among fire behavior, weather, topographic features, and fuel availability. Extinguishment may also result from a variety of ecological factors, such as changes in vegetation (fuel types), weather (a rain event), or the physical environment (e.g., moist sites unfavorable to fire spread). Wet to moist coves, stream beds, drainages, and depressions formed the most common boundaries for the observed fires that were allowed to progress until “natural” extinction. Anthropogenic disruptions of <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity,</b> such as trails, roads, or historic land-use patterns, can also impede fire growth. The characteristics of these boundaries (e.g., width, fuel type, topography), again combined with weather and fuel conditions, dictate their effectiveness. For instance, a trail was effective in stopping the 1976 Polecat Ridge Fire. In contrast, an unimproved and unmaintained road did not stop the Forney Ridge Fire. Vegetation-based controls on <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> and availability have also limited fire spread. Studies have suggested that leaf litter of pyrogenic species (e.g., oak) are more conducive to fire spread than the leaf litter of fire-sensitive, shade-intolerant species such as red maple (Abrams 2006). This phenomenon has been observed in the park, especially on the Forney Creek and Chilly Springs Fires.|$|E
30|$|We {{analyzed}} {{differences in}} fuel loads, seasonal changes in percent dead grass, and grass <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> among grass patch types. We used PROC MIXED in SAS (Vers. 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA) {{to assess the}} effect of grass cover type (fixed effect) on fuel loads within each fuel category. The largest wood category (100 hr TL) was absent from all but one sample plot, {{so it was not}} included in analyses. We generated linear contrasts to test two a priori hypotheses regarding the influence of grass type (exotic or native). The first contrast compared native grass patches with all exotic grass patches combined, while the second compared fuel loads between exotic grass patches that had burned once with those that experienced frequent fire (every 1 to 3 years). In a second analysis, we used PROC MIXED to compare the percent dead grass among patch types and between dry and wet seasons. For both analyses, we included patches as a random effect and a Satterthwaite approximation was used to generate appropriate error degrees of freedom. Finally, we used a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test in PROC FREQ to determine if grass <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity,</b> as measured by the frequency of samples containing grass fuel, differed among patches of each grass cover type (native grass, frequently burned exotic grass, and once burned exotic grass).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{small number}} of fires escape initial attack {{suppression}} efforts and become large, but their effects are significant and disproportionate. In 1983, of 200, 000 wildland fires in the United States, only 4, 000 exceeded 100 acres. However, these escaped fires accounted for roughly 95 percent of wildfire-related costs and damages (Pyne, 1984). Thus, future research efforts logically {{will focus on the}} difficult and complicated task of modeling large fires. Large fires often demonstrate higher fireline intensities, different modes of propagation and different distribution patterns through time than do steady-state fires. It is essential, although difficult, to simulate, model, and predict large fire management considerations. In the future, wildland fire modeling efforts are likely to focus on the concepts and peculiarities that large fires present in terms of behavior, suppression and control attributes. This paper reviews the problems that large fires pose to fire analysts. CONSIDERATIONS FOR MODELING LARGE FIRES No known computer model is currently available that can reliably simulate the behavior of large fires. The reasons are several: 1. Heterogeneous conditions of weather, fuel, and topography are encountered during a large fire because of the lengthy burning times and the large size that the fire finally attains. Hence, every model's inherent assumptions of <b>fuel</b> and weather <b>continuity</b> and uniformity are violated by large fires. 2. Large fires spread by means other than a flaming front through surface fuels. Crowning and spotting are different modes of propagation that often occur during a conflagration. 3. Fire-related phenomena [...] such as firewhirls, horizontal roll vortices, and convection columns [...] not common during small fires, often are present during large fires. Those phenomena magnify the spread and heat output rates and make the suppression efforts more difficult...|$|R
30|$|In the {{tropical}} Andes, anthropogenic fires have been interacting with natural ignitions for millennia to reconfigure the fire regime and population {{dynamics of the}} vegetation communities (Byers 2000, Young and Lipton 2006, DiPasquale et al. 2008, Young 2009). In the Peruvian Andes, Paduano et al. (2003) found low abundances of local and regional charcoal in the sediments of Lake Titicaca at circa 17 700 yr BP. Bush et al. (2005) reported a progressive increase in pollen concentration and charcoal between circa 15 000 yr BP and 11 000 yr BP that corresponds {{to an increase in}} vegetative cover and biomass. They also reported a sharp increase in charcoal abundance circa 3500 yr BP (mid to late Holocene) that corresponds with archaeological evidence of expanding human presence in the area. Increased anthropogenic disturbance and major influx of larger charcoal fragments are reported throughout the Andes during the late Holocene (since circa 1200 yr BP; Chepstow-Lusty et al. 1998, Bush et al. 2005, Villota and Behling 2014). Humans influence fire regimes (spread, intensity and severity, number and spatial and temporal patterns of fires) by modifying key variables (e.g., fuel type, <b>fuel</b> structure and <b>continuity,</b> ignition, etc.) that affect fire activity (Bowman et al. 2011). Ignition sources, for example, tend to increase drastically in human-altered landscapes (Cochrane and Laurance 2008), and anthropogenic fires are a major cause of increased fire incidence in {{the tropical}} Andes (Román-Cuesta et al. 2004, Román-Cuesta et al. 2011). In the Peruvian Andes, natural fires are often ignited by lightning strikes and occur mainly in the rainy season when the storms are usually associated with heavy rains (Manta Nolasco and León 2004). However, much controlled burning and extensive fires are due to livestock owners who ignite fires all year long, especially during the dry season, to eliminate dry biomass and improve grass regrowth for the following year (Sarmiento and Frolich 2002).|$|R
30|$|Alternately, the eco-cultural {{paradigm}} {{posits that}} changes in cultural practices can explain {{a portion of the}} reduced burn area. Historic First Nations’ occupation (McMillan 1995) and use of fire has been extensively documented for virtually all Canadian ecozones (Figure 1) including the Mixedwood Plains near the Great Lakes (Day 1953, Loope and Anderton 1998, Dey and Guyette 2000), the Boreal Plains (Lewis 1980, Lewis and Ferguson 1988), the Prairies of west-central Canada (Nelson and England 1971, Pyne 2007), the Montane Cordillera (Johnson-Gottsfeld 1994, Barrett and Arno 1999, White et al. 2001, Lepofsky and Lertzman 2008), and drier areas of the Pacific Maritime ecozone (Turner 1999, Beckwith 2004, Bjorkman and Vellend 2010). Cultural fire use likely declined dramatically beginning as early as the 1500 s in eastern Canada as long-term human use patterns changed due to disease-driven population declines, tribal movements, education programs, resettlement on reserves, and a myriad of other cultural changes that have altered First Nations’ land use practices (McMillan 1995, Turner et al. 2003, Pyne 2007). For example, the smallpox epidemic in the 1780 s in western North America (Boyd 1999, Binnema 2001) is coincident with several studies that show an initial decline in fire frequencies around this time (Table 2; Van Wagner et al. 2006). Recent cultural changes including fire prevention and suppression (Stocks et al. 2003, Cumming 2005, Martell and Sun 2008) are also likely important contributing factors to a second and more severe inflection in fire frequency that occurred in mid- 1900 s across much of southern Canada (Table 2, Figure 5). This recent reduction in burn area is also partially due to land use change that alters <b>fuel</b> abundance or <b>continuity</b> (Weir et al. 2000, Krawchuk et al. 2009). For example, grazing by domestic stock may reduce herbaceous biomass and hence potential for burning (Heyerdahl et al. 2006). Obviously, in the Prairie and Mixedwood Plains ecozones (Figure 1), replacing large areas of native plant communities with agricultural crops has reduced fire potential (Weir et al. 2000).|$|R
40|$|I used {{archives}} of wildfire perimeters (fire atlases) within a {{geographic information system}} (GIS) to describe and evaluate fire frequency patterns for the 20 th century in the 486, 673 -ha Gila/Aldo Leopold Wilderness Complex (GALWC), New Mexico and the 785, 090 -ha Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Complex (SBWC) in Idaho and Montana. I addressed questions about changing 20 th century fire frequencies and landscape-scale controls of fire frequency by analyzing fire atlases along with data for topography, vegetation, and climate. Similarities and differences in comparisons between study areas highlight important aspects of fire regimes and strengthen my interpretation and inference. In the GALWC, fire rotations were shortest during the recent wildfire use period (1975 - 1993) and longest during the pre-modern suppression period (1909 - 1946). In the SBWC, fire rotations were shortest during the pre-modern suppression period (1880 - 1934) and longest during the modern suppression period (1935 - 1975). Elevations with the highest fire frequencies differed between study areas. However, forest types found at these elevations are characterized by similar overstory tree species. Steeper northeastern slopes in the GALWC and southwestern slopes in the SBWC burned most frequently. I assert that, in the GALWC, horizontal <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> is a main factor determining fire frequency. In the SBWC, fuel moisture status limits fire frequency. Fires are most frequent in areas where ignitions occur and neither <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> nor fuel moisture are likely to limit fire spread. Three statistical modeling approaches were used to produce maps of reburn probabilities. Log-likelihood modeling provided the most satisfactory results, while logistic regression and classification and regression trees yielded statistically insignificant models. Empirical models contributed to the assertion that <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> limits fire frequency in the GALWC while fuel moisture limits fire frequency in the SBWC. Mapped fire perimeters provide a valuable source of spatial historical information for describing the role of large fires over broad areas. This dissertation enhances scientific knowledge about broad scale changes in fire regimes. Comparisons between areas facilitate identification of unique versus general patterns. Results provide a contemporary baseline for comparison with estimates of Pre-EuroAmerican fire frequencies, and a historical, spatial context for modeling and managing future fire regimes...|$|E
30|$|Minnich and Chou (1997) {{suggest that}} the {{systematic}} suppression of ignitions promoted the landscape-scale fire events that plague twentieth century southern California. They contend that fire suppression has increased <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> by deferring the combustion of chaparral vegetation patches relative to local thresholds of fuel accumulation. This, in turn, has selected for escaped fires in mature patches to coincide with extreme wind events, which create conditions that are unmanageable from a fire suppression standpoint. The current fire regime of rapid fire spread and extensive patch re-burn is, therefore, interpreted to be a product of these management actions (Minnich and Chou 1997).|$|E
30|$|Notably, after 1850, the {{proportion}} of earlywood scars dropped from 40 % to only 17 % of the scars, and dormant (ring-boundary) scars more than doubled from 13 % to 29 % (Figure 6) and {{was accompanied by a}} reduction in the frequency of fire activity (Figure 4). We surmise that these changes may have been a result of two factors, either individually or in combination: 1) the likely reduction in Native American burning, and 2) reduction in <b>fuel</b> <b>continuity</b> due to grazing. However, the possible influence of variation in climate patterns (effective moisture and temperature) may have also contributed.|$|E
40|$|Non-native plant invasions {{have the}} {{potential}} to change natural and prescribed fire regimes by increasing <b>fuel</b> loads, <b>continuity</b> of <b>fuels,</b> and fuel composition, which may alter fire intensity, damage native species, and promote further invasions. In this project we sought to evaluate the interaction between fire and the invasive annual grass Microstegium vimineum in eastern deciduous forests. Our goal was to determine if invasions enhance fire intensity, including fire temperatures, flame heights, and fire duration, and negatively affect tree regeneration, and stimulate further invasions. We also sought to determine how prescribed fires and the timing of fires affect the density and demography of Microstegium and we tested the pre and post-fire management options for controlling the post-fire spread of Microstegium invasions. At Big Oaks National Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Indiana, we conducted large-scale prescribed fires to evaluate fire intensity in invaded and uninvaded areas and the response of experimental and naturally regenerating trees. In small-scale plots we manipulated the timing and frequency of fires and applied herbicide treatments to evaluate demographic responses of Microstegium. Our results show that maximum fire temperatures were on average 57 % greater in Microstegium-invaded than uninvaded control areas. In addition, fires burned at temperatures over 300 °C for nearly twice as long and flame heights were 98 % higher in invaded compared to uninvaded habitats. Microstegium invasion reduced survival of experimental trees by 37 % in areas exposed to prescribed fire compared to uninvaded areas and tree survival in invaded, burned plots was 53 % lower than invaded, unburned plots. Exposure to prescribed fire increased natural tree regeneration overall but there were 60 % and 57 % fewer tree seedlings in burned and unburned invaded plots, respectively, compared to control plots with the same treatments. Prescribed fire increased Microstegium biomass by five-fold the following growing season. Experimental spring fires significantly reduced Microstegium seedling numbers by ~ 75 % immediately after the burn, but this did not result in reduced seed production at the end of season or seedling numbers the year following a burn. Burning for two springs in a row similarly reduced seedling numbers during each of the years when the burns were conducted, but this effect did not carry over to reduce Microstegium seedling numbers the following year. Similarly, fall fire reduced seedling numbers by ~ 50 % the following spring, but this reduction also did not result in reduced seed production {{at the end of that}} season. The significant effects on seedling numbers but lack of effect on Microstegium seed production was likely due to growth compensation by the surviving plants. Grassspecific, post-emergent herbicide applied without fire was very effective at reducing population numbers, almost eradicating Microstegium populations, but fire reduced herbicide effectiveness. The results of this research demonstrate significant effects of a non-native grass invasion on fire intensity, tree regeneration, and subsequent invasions in eastern deciduous forests, an ecosystem where this phenomenon has not previously been observed. Fire was not useful as a management strategy for Microstegium invasions and interfered with an otherwise effective post-emergent herbicide. To avoid the damaging effects of intense fires in invaded areas, we recommend land managers use herbicides or other treatments to remove invasions prior to the application of prescribed fires...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the methodologies, a {{software}} and results developed in the European FUME program to map the rural-urban interfaces (RUI). Three methodologies were set up for RUI mapping: two on the local scale (the community scale) and one on the global scale (the European scale). The first local scale method was developed in a French context by IRSTEA. In this case the RUI is defined by a radius of 100 metres around each house located at a distance inferior to 200 metres from forests or scrublands. The building density was used to create four classes of housing configuration. Then the structure of vegetation was characterized and mapped to emphasize its horizontal continuity with landscape ecology metrics. The RUI map was created by a combination of housing configuration and vegetation characterisation. The second local scale method developed by TRAGSATEC is based on three phases. First a settlement map creation with the union of a land use cover and a vegetation cover defines the housing and the landscape that surrounds them. Then a buffer is created around settlements which are located at a distance inferior to 400 m from the forest; its size depends on the difficulty in protecting the houses against fire. In the final phase the different types of RUI are defined from the type of settlement and vegetation-settlement connection around houses. The global scale method developed by IRSTEA makes possible the comparison of the situations and the importance of RUI in the different European countries. On the global scale, the rural urban interfaces are defined by a radius of 400 metres around houses located atless than 200 metres from forests or shrubland. The global rural urban interface map results from the combination of criteria from the Corine Land Cover database and from the soil sealing database. A major step of the work was the development of a software named RUImap with the three different methods above. The use of the tool could be very advantageous for fire risk analysis on RUI scale, and for local quantification of <b>fuel</b> charge and <b>continuity.</b> This information linked with the direct knowledge of the general context is very important for the local fire risk assessment...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of non-destructive assay (NDA) capabilities to directly measure the fissile content in spent fuel {{is needed to}} improve the timely detection of the diversion of significant quantities of fissile material. Currently, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) does not have effective NDA methods to verify spent <b>fuel</b> and recover <b>continuity</b> of knowledge {{in the event of}} a containment and surveillance systems failure. This issue has become increasingly critical with the worldwide expansion of nuclear power, adoption of enhanced safeguards criteria for spent fuel verification, and recent efforts by the IAEA to incorporate an integrated safeguards regime. In order to address these issues, the use of Self-Interrogation Neutron Resonance Densitometry (SINRD) has been developed to improve existing nuclear safeguards and material accountability measurements. The following characteristics of SINRD were analyzed: (1) ability to measure the fissile content in Light Water Reactors (LWR) fuel assemblies and (2) sensitivity and penetrability of SINRD to the removal of fuel pins from an assembly. The Monte Carlo Neutral Particle eXtended (MCNPX) transport code was used to simulate SINRD for different geometries. Experimental measurements were also performed with SINRD and were compared to MCNPX simulations of the experiment to verify the accuracy of the MCNPX model of SINRD. Based on the results from these simulations and measurements, we have concluded that SINRD provides a number of improvements over current IAEA verification methods. These improvements include: 1) SINRD provides absolute measurements of burnup independent of the operator?s declaration. 2) SINRD is sensitive to pin removal over the entire burnup range and can verify the diversion of 6 % of fuel pins within 3 ? from LWR spent LEU and MOX fuel. 3) SINRD is insensitive to the boron concentration and initial fuel enrichment and can therefore be used at multiple spent fuel storage facilities. 4) The calibration of SINRD at one reactor facility carries over to reactor sites in different countries because it uses the ratio of fission chambers (FCs) that are not facility dependent. 5) SINRD can distinguish fresh and 1 -cycle spent MOX fuel from 3 - and 4 -cycles spent LEU fuel without using reactor burnup codes...|$|R
