5|$|The electoral {{conditions}} were announced as such: The election 67 districts {{were reduced to}} 47. M'ba disqualified Aubame by announcing no one who held a post recently was banned. Any party would have to submit 47 candidates who had to pay US$160 or none at all. Thus, over US$7,500 would be deposited without considering campaign expenses. M'ba's idea was that no party other than his would {{have the money to}} enter candidates. In response to this, the opposition announced <b>its</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> participate in elections that they did not consider fair.|$|E
5|$|Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine (Wadzek's Struggle {{with the}} Steam Turbine) is a 1918 comic novel by the German author Alfred Döblin. Set in Berlin, it narrates the futile and often {{delusional}} {{struggle of the}} eponymous industrialist Wadzek against Rommel, his more powerful competitor. In its narrative technique and <b>its</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> psychologize its characters, {{as well as in}} its vivid evocations of Berlin as a modern metropolis, Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine has been read as a precursor to Döblin's better-known 1929 novel Berlin Alexanderplatz.|$|E

25|$|On 26 May 1973, the Supreme Court of Chile {{unanimously}} {{denounced the}} Allende government's {{disruption of the}} legality of the nation in its failure to uphold judicial decisions, because of <b>its</b> continual <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> permit police execution of judicial decisions contrary to the government's own measures.|$|R
50|$|While Japan {{was seen}} {{for many years}} as an {{economic}} success story {{as late as the}} early 1990s, the authors argue that its ongoing recession since then resulted from <b>its</b> governments <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> stop subsidies to many of its industries and companies (this issue is ongoing).|$|R
5|$|As a young social worker, in 1963 Stephenson led {{a boycott}} of the Bristol Omnibus Company, protesting against <b>its</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> employ Black or Asian drivers or conductors. After a 60-day boycott {{supported}} by thousands of Bristolians, the company revoked its colour bar in August. In 1964 Stephenson achieved national fame when he refused to leave a public house until he was served, resulting in a trial {{on a charge of}} failing to leave a licensed premises. His campaigns were instrumental in paving the way for the first Race Relations Act, in 1965. Stephenson is a Freeman of the City of Bristol and was awarded an OBE in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Watergate, the Ford administration was engaged {{in a number of}} conflicts with Congress. Scalia repeatedly testified before congressional committees, defending Ford administration assertions of executive privilege regarding <b>its</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> turn over documents. Within the administration, Scalia advocated a presidential veto for a bill to amend the Freedom of Information Act, which would greatly increase the act's scope. Scalia's view prevailed, and Ford vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode it. In early 1976, Scalia argued his only case before the Supreme Court, Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba. Scalia, on behalf of the US government, argued in support of Dunhill, and that position was successful.|$|E
5|$|Döblin's 1918 comic novel {{has been}} seen, in its {{experimental}} narrative technique, <b>its</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> psychologize its characters, and its depictions of Berlin as modern metropolis, as {{a precursor to}} Döblin's better-known Berlin Alexanderplatz. Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine (Wadzek's Battle with the Steam Turbine) {{tells the story of}} Wadzek, a factory owner locked in a losing battle with a more powerful competitor. His futile and increasingly delusional countermeasures culminate in the fortification and quixotic defense of his family's garden house in suburban Reinickendorf. Following the dissipation of this endeavor, he suffers a breakdown and finally flees the country, eloping aboard a steamship bound for America that is powered by the steam turbines of his victorious competitor. Döblin wrote the novel in the fall of 1914, submitting it to extensive stylistic revisions while serving as a doctor on the Western front; it was published in May 1918 by the Fischer Verlag. In its stringent refusal of a tragic tone, the book earned the praise of a young Bertolt Brecht.|$|E
25|$|Public {{reaction}} at {{the time}} was mixed; many were puzzled by <b>its</b> iconoclastic <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> conform to linear comic strip conventions and straightforward gags. But publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst loved Krazy Kat, and it continued to appear in his papers throughout its run, sometimes only by his direct order.|$|R
5000|$|John Podhoretz in Commentary {{praised the}} book, stating: [...] "The central point of Hollywood vs. America is, however, unassailable: {{not only is}} their a gaping chasm between Hollywood's America and the real America, but Hollywood seems willing to pay in the coin of reduced profits for <b>its</b> continual <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> bridge the chasm".|$|R
25|$|Israel {{escaped the}} {{political}} humiliation that befell Britain and France following their swift, forced withdrawal. In addition, <b>its</b> stubborn <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> withdraw without guarantees, even {{in defiance of}} the United States and United Nations, ended all Western efforts, mainly American and British ones, to impose a political settlement in the Middle East without taking Israel's security needs into consideration.|$|R
5|$|Cordray contested the Ku Klux Klan's {{right to}} erect a cross at the Ohio Statehouse after the state's Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board denied the Klan's request during the 1993 Christmas holiday. He argued that the {{symbolic}} meaning of the cross {{was different from the}} Christmas tree and menorah, which the state permits. The Klan prevailed in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on December 21, 1993, and erected a 10-foot (3m) cross the following day. The same board denied the Klan a permit to rally on Martin Luther King Day (January 15, 1994) due to the group's failure to pay a $15,116 bill from its Oct. 23 rally and <b>its</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> post a bond to cover expenses for the proposed rally. When the same 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision to deny the 1994 permit, the state chose not to appeal. The following year the Klan again applied {{to erect a}} cross for the Christmas holiday season, and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concurred with the prior ruling. The United States Supreme Court did not agree to hear arguments on the topic until a few weeks after Cordray resigned from his solicitor general position. After his resignation in 1994 he several times represented the federal government in the U.S. Supreme Court: two of Cordray's appearances before were by appointment of the Democratic Bill Clinton Justice Department and two were by the Republican George W. Bush Justice Department.|$|E
5|$|During {{his playing}} career, Martin greatly {{influenced}} {{the evolution of}} the sport of curling into a competitive sport. He was an instrumental part of the group that brought about the Grand Slam of Curling. In the early 2000s, he became the spokesperson for the promotion of the financial growth of curling, represented largely by the World Curling Tour, which was growing in popularity due to the benefits afforded by corporate sponsorship opportunities and cash prizes at tournaments. The Martin-led boycott of the Canadian Curling Association for <b>its</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> allow the developments in the World Curling Tour to be mirrored in the Brier catalyzed not only the transformation of the Brier, but also the growth of the Grand Slam, and in doing so, ultimately allowed the sport of curling to become a legitimate spectator sport. The development of the competitive tier of the sport also marked a change in both the players of the sport and the sport itself, as evidenced by improvements in the development and training of curlers as athletes and improvements in the quality of curling games due to better ice conditions and precision-based gameplay.|$|E

25|$|The British were {{concerned}} about maintaining Arab support as Italian Fascist and German Nazi propaganda was targeting the Arab world (and winning support).

25|$|The Great Depression of the 1930s {{caused a}} near-collapse of the colony's economy as British demand for timber plummeted. The effects of {{widespread}} unemployment were worsened by a devastating hurricane that struck the colony in 1931.

50|$|The {{essential}} ideological {{differences between}} the United States and the Soviet Union strained their relationship.
