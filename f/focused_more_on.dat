5|$|Takao's 47-year-old {{mother is}} {{divorced}} from Takao's father, and is <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> her love life than her family life. She is voiced by Fumi Hirano in Japanese and Shelley Calene-Black in English.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} {{particularly}} fourth season received progressively more negative reviews, as the show's plot diverged from its origin story of {{breaking out of}} prison, and <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> conventional elements of a government conspiracy drama series.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, Bergkamp {{was named}} De Boer's {{assistant}} at Ajax. However, after {{the arrival of}} Peter Bosz as the new head coach at Ajax, Bergkamp's role at Ajax slightly changed. He no longer {{sat on the bench}} during first-team matches, but instead <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> field training and on helping youth players reach the first team.|$|E

5000|$|Technical Secondary Education (Technisch Secundair Onderwijs; TSO. About 30% of all pupils): The TSO {{is divided}} into two groups of {{education}} again: TTK and STK.

5|$|More {{books were}} {{published}} about the Turk {{toward the end}} of the 20th century. Along with Bell's book, Charles Michael Carroll's The Great Chess Automaton (1975) <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> the studies of the Turk. Bradley Ewart's Chess: Man vs. Machine (1980) discussed the Turk as well as other purported chess-playing automatons.|$|E
5|$|The pilots {{later said}} they {{attempted}} the assassination {{in response to}} Diệm's autocratic rule, in which he <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> remaining in power than on confronting the Vietcong, a Marxist–Leninist guerilla army who were threatening to overthrow the South Vietnamese government. Cử and Quốc hoped that the airstrike would expose Diệm's vulnerability and trigger a general uprising, but this failed to materialise.|$|E
5|$|Glass Joe's French {{characteristics}} {{have been}} discussed by critics such as writer Sumantra Lahiri and Eurogamer's Oli Welsh. IGN's Craig Harris felt that the NES game <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> his weaknesses and that the Wii game emphasized his stereotypes. A member of the Retronauts podcast also {{felt that he was}} defined more by his weakness than his nationality until he learned more about French stereotypes. Chris Buffa felt that the stereotypes could be considered offensive while Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis felt that there was nothing legitimately offensive.|$|E
50|$|Muscle {{hypertrophy}} {{involves an}} increase in size of skeletal muscle through a growth in size of its component cells. Two factors contribute to hypertrophy: sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, which <b>focuses</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> increased muscle glycogen storage; and myofibrillar hypertrophy, which <b>focuses</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> increased myofibril size.|$|R

5|$|In 1977, having {{recovered}} from hip surgery, Al Costello {{teamed up with}} Kent as The Fabulous Kangaroos for a tour of Puerto Rico with the World Wrestling Council (WWC). In Puerto Rico, the Kangaroos were billed on arrival as the WWC World Tag Team Champions. The Kangaroos lost the title to Carlos Colón and Jose Rivera on March 12, 1977. The Kangaroos remained in WWC throughout 1977 and into 1978, never regaining the WWC World Tag Team Championship. After their tour in Puerto Rico ended, Don Kent returned to singles wrestling and Costello <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> managing due to his bad hip.|$|E
5|$|Kagame {{had been}} de facto leader since 1994, but had <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> military, {{foreign affairs and}} the country's {{security}} than day-to-day governance. By 2000, {{the threat posed by}} cross-border rebels was much reduced and when Bizimungu resigned, Kagame decided to seek the presidency himself. The transitional constitution was still in effect, which meant the president was elected by government ministers and the national assembly rather than by a direct election.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the long}} term, Tchaikovsky's {{influence}} over the Belyayev composers was not as great. Though they remained more eclectic in their musical approach and <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> absolute music than The Five had done, they continued writing overall in a style more akin to Rimsky-Korsakov than to Tchaikovsky. Even Glazunov backed away from echoing Tchaikovsky strongly in his mature work, instead amalgamating nationalistic and cosmopolitan styles in an eclectic approach. The Belyayev composers also spread the nationalist musical aesthetic to Russia {{as a whole and}} were themselves an influence on composers well into the Soviet era.|$|E

5|$|The 1999–2000 Devils <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> offense, {{which was}} {{reinforced}} by their 251 goals scored, good enough for second in the league. With four players scoring over 50 points, including rookie Scott Gomez's team leading 51 assists, Stevens' 29 points were only good enough for tenth on the team, and third among defencemen behind Niedermayer and Brian Rafalski. Stevens also set an NHL record, becoming {{the first player to}} play in 600 games with two teams. After finishing the season in fourth place in the conference, the Devils swept the Florida Panthers and defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in six games.|$|E
5|$|The {{dedicated}} but easily angered Djajakusuma {{was influenced}} by Usmar Ismail's realist views, although he <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> traditional aspects of life. His theatrical performances attempted to modernise traditional forms {{so that they could}} be better received in a modern world. He is credited with revitalising the Betawi theatre form lenong and received numerous awards for his filmmaking, including a lifetime achievement award at the Indonesian Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|The design {{approaches}} of Monolith Soft have shifted over its lifetime, with early games such as Xenosaga and Baten Kaitos being distinguished by a narrative-heavy approach, while later titles have <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> gameplay. The company's stated goals are to create projects with wide creative freedom {{and to allow}} younger developers to contribute to these projects. The company is also notable for its focus on promoting a comfortable working environment with little to no overtime {{in contrast to the}} majority of other Japanese game developers, alongside collaborating with other studios and companies.|$|E

5|$|White Northern Republicans, {{and some}} Democrats, became excited about an {{abolition}} amendment, holding meetings and issuing resolutions. Many blacks, {{particularly in the}} South, <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> landownership and education {{as the key to}} liberation. As slavery began to seem politically untenable, an array of Northern Democrats successively announced their support for the amendment, including Representative James Brooks, Senator Reverdy Johnson, and Tammany Hall, a powerful New York political machine.|$|E
5|$|According to The Washington Times writer Rick Snyder, Vogel did {{not know}} the horse racing {{business}} and made mistakes that negatively affected the industry in Maryland. The year-round racing Rosecroft was awarded lowered the excitement for the locals. Rosecroft was not capable of attracting a new market, and attendance figures declined. He never focused on marketing or daily operations of Rosecroft. Instead, Vogel <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> his real estate business. As a result, the attendance dropped. Vogel took out money from the betting pools to help his real estate business. Lower betting pools mean smaller payouts for the bettors and less profit for the racetrack owners. Vogel never formed political ties to help pass legislation used to help harness racing, more specially to allow off-track betting and to lower the state tax on betting pools.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} both sides claimed victory and modern views {{as to who}} won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no {{strategic}} impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held {{until the end of}} the war. Polish historiography during the People's Republic of Poland portrayed the battle as difficult, but victorious. After the fall of communism, Polish historians became much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming the near destruction of the Polish force on his incompetence and desire to capture Dresden. The battle's outcome is now generally seen in Poland as a very costly victory for the Soviets and their Polish allies.|$|E

5|$|As a student, Kincaid showed {{exceptional}} {{aptitude for}} the natural sciences and achieved national attention for his scientific achievements. In 1897, while still an undergraduate, he accompanied David Starr Jordan to the Pribilof Islands {{as part of a}} study of seals undertaken by the American Fur Seal Commission. Back in Washington, Kincaid's interests <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> insect life, and a report that year in the Boston Evening Transcript noted that he had discovered 41 new species of bees, including 22 of the genus Osmia. Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell, at the time one of America's leading entomologists, directed a portion of the sizable Kincaid bee collection to the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{political}} upheaval, the Egyptian temple style continued to evolve without absorbing much foreign influence. Whereas earlier temple building mostly focused on male gods, goddesses and child deities grew increasingly prominent. Temples <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> popular religious {{activities such as}} oracles, animal cults, and prayer. New architectural forms continued to develop, such as covered kiosks in front of gateways, more elaborate column styles, and the mammisi, a building celebrating the mythical birth of a god. Though {{the characteristics of the}} late temple style had developed by the last period of native rule, most of the examples date from the era of the Ptolemies, Greek kings who ruled as pharaohs for nearly 300 years.|$|E
5|$|For {{the album}} session, Steve Albini was engineer, Josephine Wiggs {{replaced}} Halliday on bass, Britt Walford played drums, and both Deal and Donelly played guitar. Following {{two weeks of}} practicing in England, the Breeders recorded Pod at the Palladium studio in Scotland. Albini recorded the group quickly, and <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> getting good sounds from the musical equipment than on trying to improve the musicians' performances. Critics have discussed similarities between Pod and the Pixies' music, and commented favorably or unfavorably on Pods relative quality to that band's work. The album has been noted for its minimal instrumentation, and for its sexual, dark, girl-like lyrics.|$|E
