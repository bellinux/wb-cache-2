5|$|Since 1994, the Wonderbra has {{expanded}} from the single push-up design into a <b>full-range</b> lingerie fashion label {{in most of}} the world. In most countries, the brand emphasizes sex-appeal. In its native Canada, however, the brand promotes the functional qualities of its products—a departure from the strategy that made Wonderbra the top-seller in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The Quad Electrostatic Loudspeaker (ESL) is the world's first {{production}} <b>full-range</b> electrostatic loudspeaker, {{launched in}} 1957 by Quad Electroacoustics, {{then known as}} the Acoustical Manufacturing Co. Ltd. The speaker is shaped somewhat like a home electric radiator curved slightly on the vertical axis. They are widely admired for their clarity and precision, but known to be difficult speakers to run and maintain.|$|E
5|$|In {{professional}} concert {{sound system}} design, subwoofers {{can be incorporated}} seamlessly with the main speakers into a stereo or mono <b>full-range</b> system by using an active crossover. Such a system receives its signal from the main mono or stereo mixing console mix bus and amplifies all frequencies together in the desired balance. If the main sound system is stereo, the subwoofers can also be in stereo. Otherwise, a mono subwoofer channel can be derived within the crossover from a stereo mix, depending on the crossover make and model.|$|E
5|$|The sound {{equipment}} {{was provided by}} Showco who used the PRISM system, which adapted the show for each venue according to its height, width and the coverage required. The sound was mixed by Front of house engineer Monty Lee Wilkes {{on a combination of}} Yamaha PM4000 and PM3000 consoles, an unusual choice for Spears's shows. He used dbx 903 compressors for kick and snare drums. The compressors were also used on Spears's microphones, a Shure Beta 58A handheld and a Crown CM-311AE headset-mounted capsule. Spears's vocals were mostly live—pre-recorded vocals ran in parallel on an ADAT machine during the shows, and were used to replace her live microphone when the dance routines became too energetic for good voice control. Spears's band, backline technicians and monitor engineer Raza Sufi were all fitted with in-ear monitors and headset mics, enabling rapid and clear communications around the stage area. Spears did not use them, preferring the ambient sound of a battery of eight Showco SRM wedges spread across the downstage area. These were augmented by Showco SS <b>full-range</b> sidefills and a pair of one-by-18-inch subs {{on each side of the}} stage. Sufi also used a dbx 160A to limit Spears's louder moments, while backing vocalists were controlled by a duo of BSS DPR901 dynamic equalizers. Effects were limited to vocal and drum reverbs. Amplification for the wedges and the FOH system were all Crown-based, with a pair of drum stool shakers completing the line-up. All the cables used during the tour were brought from the US, even in Europe, something unusual in audio production.|$|E

25|$|<b>Full-range</b> drivers often employ an {{additional}} cone called a whizzer: a small, light cone {{attached to the}} joint between the voice coil and the primary cone. The whizzer cone extends the high-frequency response of the driver and broadens its high frequency directivity, which would otherwise be greatly narrowed due to the outer diameter cone material failing {{to keep up with}} the central voice coil at higher frequencies. The main cone in a whizzer design is manufactured so as to flex more in the outer diameter than in the center. The result is that the main cone delivers low frequencies and the whizzer cone contributes most of the higher frequencies. Since the whizzer cone is smaller than the main diaphragm, output dispersion at high frequencies is improved relative to an equivalent single larger diaphragm.|$|E

While the band recognize that their merchandise is their biggest revenue income, they insist Tattered and Torn {{is more than just}} band merchandising. Vocalist Corey Taylor said, [...] "It's a way for [...] to get cool clothing at affordable prices." [...] The first items from the clothing line went on sale in late July 2008 through Hot Topic stores across North America and the Hot Topic website. Currently the line is limited to shirts and hoodies but was expected to develop into a <b>full-range</b> clothing line.|$|E
500|$|Touring {{subwoofer}} cabinets {{are typically}} designed with features that facilitate moving the enclosure (e.g., wheels, a [...] "towel bar" [...] handle and recessed handles), a protective grill for the speaker (in direct radiating-style cabinets), metal or plastic {{protection for the}} cabinets to protect the finish as the cabinets are being slid {{one on top of}} another, and hardware to facilitate stacking the cabinets (e.g., interlocking corners) and for [...] "flying" [...] the cabinets from stage rigging. In the 2000s, many small-to mid-size subwoofers designed for [...] bands' live sound use and DJ applications are [...] "powered subs"; that is, they have an integrated power amplifier. These models typically have a built-in crossover. Some models have a metal-reinforced hole in which a speaker stand can be mounted for <b>full-range</b> cabinets.|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, gigging musicians were finding that older Leslies like the 122 were not {{loud enough for}} large venues, {{which led to the}} {{introduction}} of the [...] "Pro Line" [...] series. These Leslies had louder solid-state power amplifiers, and were mounted on casters for ease of portability. The first models Leslie manufactured were the 900 and 910, which contained a 100 watt, three-channel power amplifier. Both could split into two sections. The most popular version of the Pro-Line series was the 760. It was a smaller version of the 900 and 910, and contained a 40 watt treble and 50 watt bass amplifier. A smaller, more portable version of the 760 is the 820. It is a solid-state cabinet like the 760, and it connects to the organ with a 9-pin connector as well. However, it is only [...] high and has only a single rotor with a <b>full-range</b> 12-inch speaker.|$|E
500|$|Instead {{of being}} {{incorporated}} into a <b>full-range</b> system, concert subwoofers can be supplied with their own signal from a separate mix bus on the mixing console; often one of the auxiliary sends ("aux" [...] or [...] "auxes") is used. This configuration is called [...] "aux-fed subwoofers", and has been observed to significantly reduce low frequency [...] "muddiness" [...] that can build up in a concert sound system which has on stage a number of microphones each picking up low frequencies and each having different phase relationships of those low frequencies. The aux-fed subs method greatly reduces the number of sources feeding the subwoofers to include only those instruments that have desired low frequency information; sources such as kick drum, bass guitar, samplers and keyboard instruments. This simplifies the signal sent to the subwoofers and makes for greater clarity and low punch. Aux-fed subs can even be stereo, if desired, using two auxiliary mix buses.|$|E
2500|$|The first <b>full-range</b> {{test of the}} DF-5 ICBM was {{conducted}} on May 18, 1980. The payload reached its target located 9300km away in the South Pacific (...) and retrieved five minutes later by helicopter.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next step}} in the signal path {{generally}} depends {{on the size of the}} system in place. [...] In smaller systems, the main outputs are often sent to an additional equalizer, or directly to a power amplifier, with one or more loudspeakers (typically two, one on each side of the stage in smaller venues, or a large number in big venues) that are connected to that amplifier. [...] In large-format systems, the signal is typically first routed through an equalizer then to a crossover. [...] A crossover splits the signal into multiple frequency bands with each band being sent to separate amplifiers and speaker enclosures for low, middle, and high-frequency signals. [...] Low-frequency signals are sent to amplifiers and then to subwoofers, and middle and high-frequency sounds are typically sent to amplifiers which power <b>full-range</b> speaker cabinets. Using a crossover to separate the sound into low, middle and high frequencies can lead to a [...] "cleaner", clearer sound (see bi-amplification) than routing all of the frequencies through a single <b>full-range</b> speaker system. Nevertheless, many small venues still use a single <b>full-range</b> speaker system, as it is easier to set up and less expensive.|$|E

2500|$|Phonograph {{records are}} {{generally}} described by their diameter in inches (12-inch, 10-inch, 7-inch), the rotational speed in {{revolutions per minute}} (rpm) at which they are played ( [...] , , , 45, 78), and their time capacity, determined by their diameter and speed (LP , 12-inch disc, rpm; SP , 10-inch disc, 78rpm, or 7-inch disc, 45rpm; EP , 12-inch disc, [...] or 45rpm); their reproductive quality, or level of fidelity (high-fidelity, orthophonic, <b>full-range,</b> etc.); {{and the number of}} audio channels (mono, stereo, quad, etc.).|$|E
2500|$|A <b>full-range</b> {{driver is}} a speaker {{designed}} to be used alone to reproduce an audio channel {{without the help of}} other drivers, and therefore must cover the entire audio frequency range. These drivers are small, typically [...] in diameter to permit reasonable high frequency response, and carefully designed to give low-distortion output at low frequencies, though with reduced maximum output level. <b>Full-range</b> (or more accurately, wide-range) drivers are most commonly heard in public address systems, in televisions (although some models are suitable for hi-fi listening), small radios, intercoms, some computer speakers, etc. In hi-fi speaker systems, the use of wide-range drive units can avoid undesirable interactions between multiple drivers caused by non-coincident driver location or crossover network issues. Fans of wide-range driver hi-fi speaker systems claim a coherence of sound due to the single source and a resulting lack of interference, and likely also to the lack of crossover components. Detractors typically cite wide-range drivers' limited frequency response and modest output abilities (most especially at low frequencies), together with their requirement for large, elaborate, expensive enclosures—such as transmission lines, quarter wave resonators or horns—to approach optimum performance. With the advent of neodymium drivers, low cost quarter wave transmission lines are made possible and are increasingly made availably commercially.|$|E
2500|$|Guitar combo {{amplifiers}} were {{at first}} used with bass guitars and electric pianos, but these instruments produce a wider frequency range and need a <b>full-range</b> speaker system. Much more amplifier power {{is required to}} reproduce low-frequency sound, especially at high volume. Reproducing low frequencies also requires a suitable woofer or subwoofer speaker and enclosure, with bass cabinets often being larger in size than a cabinet for mid-range or high-range sounds. As well, the open-back cabinets used on many electric guitar amps, while effective for electric guitar, do not have good bass reproduction.|$|E
2500|$|A {{simple and}} {{inexpensive}} PA loudspeaker {{may have a}} single <b>full-range</b> loudspeaker driver, housed in a suitable enclosure. [...] More elaborate, professional-caliber sound reinforcement loudspeakers may incorporate separate drivers to produce low, middle, and high frequency sounds. [...] A crossover network routes the different frequencies to the appropriate drivers. [...] In the 1960s, horn loaded theater loudspeakers and PA speakers were almost always [...] "columns" [...] of multiple drivers mounted in a vertical line within a tall enclosure. [...] The 1970s to early 1980s {{was a period of}} innovation in loudspeaker design with many sound reinforcement companies designing their own speakers. [...] The basic designs were based on commonly known designs and the speaker components were commercial speakers.|$|E
2500|$|The gain of a {{good quality}} <b>full-range</b> audio {{amplifier}} will be essentially flat between 20Hz to about 20kHz (the range of normal human hearing). In ultra-high-fidelity amplifier design, the amplifier's frequency response should extend considerably beyond this (one or more octaves either side) and might have [...] points < 10nbsp&Hz and > [...] Professional touring amplifiers often have input and/or output filtering to sharply limit frequency response beyond {{too much of the}} amplifier's potential output power would otherwise be wasted on infrasonic and ultrasonic frequencies, and the danger of AM radio interference would increase. Modern switching amplifiers need steep low pass filtering at the output to get rid of high-frequency switching noise and harmonics.|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} {{subwoofer}} speaker cabinets and power amplifiers dedicated to low-frequency sounds {{used in a}} club depends {{on the type of}} club, the genres of music played there (live or via a DJ), {{and the size of the}} venue. A small coffeehouse where traditional folk, bluegrass or jazz groups are the main performers may have no subwoofers, and instead rely on the <b>full-range</b> main PA speakers to reproduce bass sounds. On the other hand, a club where hard rock or heavy metal music bands play or a nightclub where house music DJs play dance music may have multiple large 18" [...] subwoofers in big cabinets and powerful amplifiers dedicated for subwoofers, as these genres and music styles typically use powerful, deep bass sound.|$|E
2500|$|... "Weekend band" [...] PA {{systems are}} a niche market for small, {{powerful}} touring SR gear. Weekend bands need {{systems that are}} {{small enough to fit}} into a minivan or a car trunk, and yet powerful enough to give adequate and even sound dispersion and vocal intelligibility in a noisy club or bar. As well, the systems need to be easy and quick to set up. Sound reinforcement companies have responded to this demand by offering equipment that fulfills multiple roles, such as powered mixers (a mixer with an integrated power amplifier and effects) and powered subwoofers (a subwoofer with an integrated power amplifier and crossover). These products minimize the amount of wiring connections that bands have to make to set up the system and they take less time to set up. Some subwoofers have metal speaker mount holes built into the top, so that they can double as a base for the stand-mounted <b>full-range</b> PA speaker cabinets.|$|E
2500|$|Drummers using {{electronic}} drums, drum machines, or hybrid acoustic-electric kits (which blend traditional acoustic {{drums and}} cymbals with electronic pads) typically use a monitor speaker, keyboard amplifier {{or even a}} small PA system to hear the electronic drum sounds. Even a drummer playing entirely acoustic drums may use a monitor speaker to hear her drums, especially if she is playing in a loud rock or metal band, where there is substantial onstage volume from huge, powerful guitar stacks. Since the drum kit uses the deep bass drum, drummers are often given a large speaker cabinet with a 15" [...] subwoofer to help them monitor their bass drum sound (along with a <b>full-range</b> monitor speaker to hear {{the rest of their}} kit). Some sound engineers and drummers prefer to use an electronic vibration system, colloquially known as a [...] "butt shaker" [...] or [...] "throne thumper" [...] to monitor the bass drum, because this lowers the stage volume. With a [...] "butt shaker", the [...] "thump" [...] of each bass drum strike causes a vibration in the drum stool; this way the drummer feels their beat on the posterior, rather than hears it.|$|E
5000|$|A {{large number}} of <b>full-range</b> drive units are used in {{commercial}} sound systems, which may employ a number of 200 mm (8") <b>full-range</b> drivers, mounted into suspended ceilings or small 'back-box' enclosures. These convey background music and announcements to workers and visitors in retail stores, and public spaces. While these drivers are classed as 'full-range', {{it may be more}} accurate to term them 'wide-range' drivers, since their output abilities rarely extend to the extremes of the frequency range. Several manufacturers build small (typically 115 mm (4.5")) diameter <b>full-range</b> drivers into miniature enclosures, and many of these include 25 or 70-volt line transformers, for use on commercial sound systems employing long speaker cables. Some <b>full-range</b> speaker systems are designed with limited-range drivers, and must be used with equalizers to flatten and extend their frequency response, while others achieve acceptable response without electronic assistance. There are <b>full-range</b> speaker systems using up to 15" [...] single drivers.|$|E

5000|$|Since the {{requirements}} of a <b>full-range</b> driver include both good low and high frequency response (which are contradictory in terms of physical construction), a <b>full-range</b> driver is usually limited to covering the audio spectrum above perhaps 100 Hz—leaving lower frequencies to be handled / augmented by a separate sub woofer or by a special cabinet design for low frequency reinforcement. These requirements usually mean that the <b>full-range</b> must have good sensitivity (for lower frequencies) with a light voice coil (for high frequencies) [...] - [...] these speakers commonly use a larger or more powerful magnet than usual, which improves sensitivity and thus lowers the power requirement at low frequencies as well as allowing a lighter voice coil. In addition, many have limited maximum excursions, requiring special enclosures which do not require large excursions at low frequencies for reasonable low end output.|$|E
