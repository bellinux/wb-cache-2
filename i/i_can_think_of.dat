5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E

Of Dumilâtre he wrote, [...] "... in spite of her coldness, [...] {{deserved}} the success she achieved by the correctness and the 'mythological' quality of her poses: perhaps this word may seem a little pretentious, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> no other to express such cold and noble dancing as would suit Minerva in a merry mood, and in this respect [...] seems to bear a strong resemblance to that goddess." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{the death}} of Mao Zedong in 1976, Benn {{described}} Mao as [...] "one of the greatest – if not the greatest – figures of the twentieth century: a schoolteacher who transformed China, released it from civil war and foreign attack and constructed a new society there" [...] in his diaries, adding that [...] "he certainly towers above any twentieth-century figure <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> in his philosophical contribution and military genius". On his trip to the Chinese embassy after Mao's death, Benn recorded in an earlier volume of his diaries that he was [...] "a great admirer of Mao", while also admitting that [...] "he made mistakes, because everybody does".|$|E

500|$|Film analyst Lina Badley {{has written}} that the Alien's design, with strong Freudian sexual undertones, {{multiple}} phallic symbols, and overall feminine figure, provides an androgynous image conforming to archetypal mappings and imageries in horror films that often redraw gender lines. O'Bannon himself later described the sexual imagery in Alien as overt and intentional: [...] "One thing that people are all disturbed about is sex... I said 'That's how I'm going to attack the audience; I'm going to attack them sexually. And I'm {{not going to go}} after the women in the audience, I'm going to attack the men. I am going to put in every image <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> to make the men in the audience cross their legs. Homosexual oral rape, birth. The thing lays its eggs down your throat, the whole number.|$|E
500|$|The {{final scene}} wherein Doggett and his ex-wife scatter Luke's remains was called [...] "difficult" [...] by Robert Patrick. He later noted that Manners [...] "was there {{to guide us}} along; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> no worst [...] {{nightmare}} for a parent than to lose their child." [...] The episode was written to create closure to Doggett's story. Patrick later said that, if the series had continued for a tenth season, {{he would have liked}} to see his character develop a relationship with Reyes, because [...] "I think Doggett was very attracted to Reyes [...] I would have liked to see the relationship with Reyes explored more." [...] Gish agreed, noting that the show's ending never allowed the idea to be fleshed out, but that Reyes [...] "would have definitely gone further with their relationship." ...|$|E
500|$|VanDerWerff called Kurt {{opening his}} NYADA {{rejection}} letter [...] "as good a gut-punch as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> for this series", though John Kubicek of BuddyTV characterized it as [...] "the most unbelievable plot twist ever on this show". Bell hoped {{that this would}} extend his stay in Lima because it could give [...] "more screen time for Burt Hummel, who is arguably the best character on Glee". The scene where Burt gives Kurt his present {{was described as a}} [...] "gift" [...] by many reviewers. Kubicek wrote, [...] "Kudos to Glee for turning a sappy moment into a funny one", and Strecker noted how powerful scenes typically were between the Hummels before she added [...] "last night was no exception", and ended by quoting Kurt: [...] "Best. Graduation Gift. Ever." ...|$|E

500|$|Off the field, Granderson {{has served}} as an {{ambassador}} for Major League Baseball International. He has traveled to England, Italy, the Netherlands, France, South Africa, China, New Zealand, South Korea and Japan to promote baseball. In appreciation for his efforts, Commissioner Bud Selig penned a thank-you letter to Granderson which read in part, [...] "There are so many fine young men playing Major League baseball today, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> no one who is better suited to represent our national pastime than you." [...] He has also served as something of an unofficial baseball ambassador to the African-American community, often participating in and initiating dialogue {{about the lack of}} black players {{at all levels of the}} sport. When he endorsed Nike, Inc., Louisville Slugger and Rawlings, he asked them to donate money to his foundation or equipment to inner-city baseball programs rather than pay him.|$|E
500|$|At the 2014 Hero Complex Film Festival, Sigourney Weaver {{hinted that}} she'd be {{interested}} in returning {{to the role of}} Ripley, stating that Resurrection's ending [...] "feels incomplete to me. I wish it didn't, but it does. We left it hanging. And there's a way to finish this story that i think would be satisfying to me and the many fans." [...] She also stated regarding the hybrid character that [...] "Had we done a fifth one, I don't doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. I do feel like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. I could imagine a situation where we finish telling the story." [...] She was quoted: [...] "I don't think Alien belongs on Earth popping out of a haystack, which is where I was afraid it was going to go. I feel it should take place in {{the far reaches of the}} universe where no one in their right mind would go. There are very few filmmakers that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that I would want to entrust this to." ...|$|E
500|$|ChicagoNow writer Andy Daglas {{said the}} fact that Andy and April's wedding was subdued, not overhyped in {{commercials}} to attract ratings, shows how much the writers understand and respect their characters. He also praised the episode's blend of [...] "humor and heart", of which he said: [...] "No show on the air, and few shows <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> ever, does it better." [...] Zap2it writer Rick Porter said he {{was surprised by the}} wedding twist, particularly by {{the fact that}} the wedding was not stopped at the last moment by a [...] "TV-style complication". He also praised the subplot with Ann and Donna, and said he hoped the two characters would continue to interact with each other throughout the season. The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow said [...] "Andy and April's Fancy Party" [...] showed how well the April and Andy characters have developed since their romantic story arc began in the second season episode [...] "Hunting Trip". Meslow said the episode [...] "couldn't have been better" [...] and was even effective during unabashed sentimental scenes, like the wedding itself and April voicing her appreciation for Leslie. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said the wedding felt appropriate for the two characters, and he enjoyed the progression of Leslie going from dreading the wedding to accepting it. Heisler wrote, [...] "Truly, I don't think I've ever watched an episode of Parks & Rec without feeling great at the end." ...|$|E

500|$|On 31 July 2009, Robson died of {{lung cancer}} at his home in County Durham, aged 76, after a long battle with the disease. After the news of his death, leading figures from the world of {{football}} and politics paid tribute to him. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson called him a [...] "great friend, a wonderful individual and tremendous football man". UEFA president Michel Platini said, [...] "He will be remembered not only for his playing career and his outstanding managerial career at both club and international level, but also because he was a truly warm and passionate human being." [...] Gary Lineker said, [...] "It is a sad day and a great loss. He was a wonderful man and will be deeply missed by everybody in the country. I never played for a more enthusiastic man. He gave so much to the game." [...] Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair described Robson as a [...] "real Geordie gentleman". According to the then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Robson [...] "epitomised everything that is great about football in this country". His friend, the broadcaster Michael Parkinson, said, [...] "Robson will be remembered long after the present lot are old bones. By his decency, his humour, his love of the game's traditions and origins and confusion at what it had become, he made present day football look what it is – shabby by comparison. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> no more fitting epitaph." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1839, Ralph Waldo Emerson {{was seeking}} an editor for his transcendentalist journal The Dial. After several {{declined}} the position, he {{offered it to}} Fuller, referring to her as [...] "my vivacious friend." [...] Emerson had met Fuller in Cambridge in 1835; of that meeting, he admitted [...] "she made me laugh more than I liked." [...] The next summer, Fuller spent two weeks at Emerson's home in Concord. Fuller accepted Emerson's offer to edit The Dial on October 20, 1839, and began work {{in the first week}} of 1840. She edited the journal for its first two years from 1840 to 1842, though her promised annual salary of $200 was never paid. Because of her role, she was soon recognized as one of the most important figures of the transcendental movement and was invited to George Ripley's Brook Farm, a communal experiment. Fuller never officially joined the community but was a frequent visitor, often spending New Year's Eve there. In the summer of 1843, she traveled to Chicago, Milwaukee, Niagara Falls, and Buffalo, New York; while there, she interacted with several Native Americans, including members of the Ottawa and the Chippewa tribes. She reported her experiences in a book called Summer on the Lakes, which she completed writing on her 34th birthday in 1844. The critic Evert Augustus Duyckinck called it [...] "the only genuine book, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> this season." [...] Fuller used the library at Harvard College to do research on the Great Lakes region, and became the first woman allowed to use Harvard's library.|$|E
500|$|Ben Williams from New York {{magazine}} {{described the}} song as sounding both throbbing {{as well as}} wistful. Christian John Wikane from PopMatters called the song a propulsive track. Alan Braidwood of the BBC, noted of the track: [...] "full-on dance, dark, disco, fun, big" [...] and compared it to other Madonna songs like [...] "Vogue", [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". Tom Bishop from the BBC commented that Madonna has either reinvigorated her career or she is [...] "merely throwing one final dance party for her long-term fans before settling down to record more sedate material". Jason Shawhan from About.com commented that the song has [...] "way too much Abba in it for its own good." [...] He went on to elaborate that [...] "he only reason <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{for this to be}} chosen as the first single was the Motorola ad campaign. It's not a bad song by far, it has pep and a sense of fun, but it's not even close to being one of the best songs on the record". Bill Lamb of About.com said that the ABBA sample sounded completely effortless like much of Madonna's best dance music. He further elaborated that what [...] "'Hung Up' amounts to is a big gushy love note to Madonna's core fans, those club kids who pack the floor every time they hear the pounding beats of a Madonna classic and the dj's who can't get enough of spinning her records. 'Hung Up' will send those fans into ecstasy, and it sounds good on the radio, too". Thomas Inskeep of Stylus Magazine declared that [...] "Hung Up" [...] and the next single [...] "Sorry" [...] might not have the same sleaze as Madonna's older songs like [...] "Physical Attraction" [...] or [...] "Burning Up", but have the same modus operandi of being designed for [...] "sweaty up-all-night dancing". Rob Harvilla from The Village Voice called the song a triumphant jazz exercise.|$|E

500|$|Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson {{wrote that}} [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] {{sounds like a}} [...] "Tumblr-meme version" [...] of the singer's 2006 single, [...] "Get Together". He added that the release [...] "may not be the nadir of Madonna's career so far, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> few moments that feel as much a {{betrayal}} of her legacy than the way she deadpans 'It's so erotic' right before chirping 'This feeling can't be beat'." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy felt the production credits for MDNA had fueled [...] "over-inflated expectations" [...] for the single. Copsey found it was not [...] "forward-thinking" [...] like Madonna's past records and cited the lyrics [...] "Girls they just wanna have some fun/ Get fired up like a smoking gun" [...] {{as an example of}} this, although he concluded his review writing [...] "we defy anyone who isn't singing this back to themselves immediately after." [...] The New York Observer journalist Daniel D'Addario compared it to [...] "Music", but added that [...] "Madonna was twelve years younger at that time and thus perhaps a more convincing 'bad girl', so too was our culture... maybe it's time for her to try something totally different?" [...] In another article for The Guardian, Gareth Grundy proclaimed [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] to be a [...] "clumsy rave-pop", while Amanda Dobbins from New York panned it as a [...] "paint-by-numbers, 808- and Tanqueray-referencing dance track that falls even flatter when compared to its source material". Malone from NME found no innovation in the track, writing, [...] "combined with earlier single 'Give Me All Your Luvin' it points to an uneasy mix for album MDNA." [...] Margaret Wappler from Los Angeles Times felt that Madonna would have been better re-releasing [...] "Music" [...] again as a single, instead of [...] "Girl Gone Wild". She added that [...] "There's something very attractive about a song this militaristic and precise, but in Madge's too-capable hands it's also suffocatingly professional." ...|$|E
