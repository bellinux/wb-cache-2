40|$|Abstract Aims The {{purpose of}} this {{prospective}} randomised study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and the appropriate dose of the ropivacaine in the control of post-knee arthroscopy pain. Methods We randomised 60 patients in two groups to receive 10 ml/ 7. 5 mg/ml ropivacaine (Group B) or 20 ml/ 7. 5 mg/ml (Group A) {{at the end of}} a routine knee arthroscopy. We monitored the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, allergic reactions, headache, nausea, we assessed the pain using the visual analogue score at intervals of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 hours after the operation. and we recorded the need for extra analgesia. Results The <b>intraarticular</b> <b>use</b> of the ropivacaine provided excellent control of pain after knee arthroscopy. At two hours post-operatively there wasn't any difference between the two groups. Afterwards, the Group A showed increased pain and need for supplementary medication. Conclusion We believe that <b>intraarticular</b> <b>use</b> of ropivacaine is effective to reduce post-operative pain minimising the use of systematic analgesia. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Bone wax is used {{to control}} femoral neck {{bleeding}} during open femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) surgery. Despite its widespread use, only a few case reports and small case series describe side effects after extraarticular use. It is unclear whether <b>intraarticular</b> <b>use</b> of bone wax leads to such complications. However, during revision FAI surgery, we have observed various degrees of articular inflammatory reactions. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We therefore investigated whether the bone wax used intraarticularly to control femoral neck bleeding during FAI surgery could {{be associated with the}} inflammatory reactions observed at revision surgery. METHODS We visually inspected the area and analyzed biopsy specimens from all 14 patients undergoing revision surgery from March 2005 to March 2006, 11 of whom had bone wax used at the time of original surgery. The three patients who did not have bone wax were used as controls. RESULTS Bone wax was identified macroscopically on the femoral neck {{at the time of the}} revision surgery in all 11 patients. In all 11 patients, biopsy results indicated a foreign body-type chronic synovial inflammation. Five patients also had an associated synovial lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory reaction. No inflammatory reaction was observed in the biopsy specimens obtained from the three patients in whom bone wax was not originally used. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest a synovial foreign body reaction, with or without an associated lymphoplasmacytic chronic inflammatory reaction, may be associated with <b>intraarticular</b> <b>use</b> of bone wax.

40|$|Overview summary Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{synovial}} lining cells are susceptible to in vivo transfection using purified expression plasmid DNA. Roessler et al. now report on the use of a plasmid that mediates transient overexpression of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase to transfect synovial lining cells in an animal model of proliferative inflammatory arthritis. After in vivo <b>intraarticular</b> transfection <b>using</b> the pNGVL-TK expression plasmid, the animals were treated with intravenous ganciclovir for a period of 3 days. They report that examination of the synovial tissues 21 days after completion of the gene therapy showed evidence of cytolysis that was confined to the synovial lining cells within inflamed synovium. No evidence of cytolysis or necrosis was observed in articular cartilage present within the treated joints. Similar methods to achieve a molecular lysis of the synovial lining layer may have applicability to the treatment of human inflammatory arthritis...|$|R
40|$|Total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) is {{a commonly}} performed procedure {{for the treatment}} of end-stage arthritis of the knee. Pain control following TKA is difficult to manage in some patients. We examined the use of a postoperative intraarticular injection of 100  mL of 0. 2 % (200  mg) ropivacaine in a double-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled pilot study to evaluate its use as a pain control modality. All patients received general anesthesia. Postoperatively, patients were placed on intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with morphine. The ropivacaine group showed an early trend in lower visual analog scale (VAS) scores when compared with the placebo group. Patients receiving ropivacaine used a similar amount of narcotics compared with the placebo group. <b>Intraarticular</b> ropivacaine <b>used</b> for pain control after TKA demonstrated no statistically significant difference in lowering VAS scores or narcotic usage; therefore, intraarticular ropivacaine as a single modality is not recommended for effective pain management...|$|R

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that the local long-term application of PDGF-BB via a biodegradable drug delivery tool influences structural and mechanical properties during free tendon graft remodeling after ACL reconstruction. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} study that has used a growth factor to accelerate graft tissue remodeling in an <b>intraarticular</b> setting <b>using</b> a large animal model. In the past, most studies investigating ligament healing or graft remodeling described inferior structural properties, such as a reduced tensile strength or an increased cross-sectional area, compared with the uninjured native tissue. This observation has a tremendous clinical consequence for the functional restitution of injured knee joints. Therefore, there is a strong need to improve structural properties of healing or remodeling ligament tissue. The use of growth factors solely or in combination may thus present a promising tool toward the complete structural and mechanical restitution of healing soft tissue. We {{have demonstrated}} that the local application of PDGF to a free tendon graft is effective in changing certain structural and mechanical properties, although the tissue was in an avas- cular and intra-articular environment. If this effect can further be improved by, for example, refining the drug delivery tool, finding the most effective dosage, or combining different growth factors, it should encourage further research...|$|R
30|$|The Goel technique, {{in which}} C 1 – 2 <b>intraarticular</b> spacers are <b>used,</b> may be {{performed}} to restore stability to a disrupted atlantoaxial complex by placing polyaxial screws and plates [22]. In 2001, Harms described {{a new way}} for atlantoaxial stabilization that could bypass the limitations found in both the previous wiring posterior fixation and the transarticular screws in cases associated with C 1 –C 2 alignment loss and posterior arc involvement. Harms developed Goel’s work on atlantoaxial screw fixation by a technique based on lateral mass polyaxial screw in C 1 and pars or pedicle polyaxial screw in C 2. This technique showed biomechanical results that are comparable to those with Magerl’s technique [23, 24]. With surgeons with good expertise and well-equipped operative rooms, Harms technique shows less intraoperative complications with satisfactory postoperative biomechanics results [23].|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the role played}} by multidetector computed tomography in decision making in the management of extra and intraarticular fractures of the calcaneus. Patients and methods: Twenty-eight patients with calcaneal fractures were included. Radiographs and multidetector computed tomography were performed.

No statistically significant correlation was found between Sanders fractures types I, II and III and Bohler’s angle. However, a significant correlation was found concerning type IV (p =  0. 013). There was a significant correlation between Sanders classification and calcaneocuboid joint involvement (p =  0. 031).

40|$|Abstract Background The {{extended}} knee lateral midpatellar portal for intraarticular {{injection of}} the knee is accurate but is not practical for all patients. We hypothesized that a modified anteriolateral portal where the synovial membrane of the medial femoral condyle is the target would be highly accurate and effective for intraarticular injection {{of the knee}}. Methods 83 subjects with non-effusive osteoarthritis of the knee were randomized to <b>intraarticular</b> injection <b>using</b> the modified anteriolateral bent knee versus the standard lateral midpatellar portal. After hydrodissection of the synovial membrane with lidocaine using a mechanical syringe (reciprocating procedure device), 80 mg of triamcinolone acetonide were injected into the knee with a 2. 0 -in (5. 1 -cm) 21 -gauge needle. Baseline pain, procedural pain, and pain at outcome (2 weeks and 6 months) were determined with the 10 cm Visual Analogue Pain Score (VAS). The accuracy of needle placement was determined by sonographic imaging. Results The lateral midpatellar and anteriolateral portals resulted in equivalent clinical outcomes including procedural pain (VAS midpatellar: 4. 6 ± 3. 1 cm; anteriolateral: 4. 8 ± 3. 2 cm; p = 0. 77), pain at outcome (VAS midpatellar: 2. 6 ± 2. 8 cm; anteriolateral: 1. 7 ± 2. 3 cm; p = 0. 11), responders (midpatellar: 45 %; anteriolateral: 56 %; p = 0. 33), duration of therapeutic effect (midpatellar: 3. 9 ± 2. 4 months; anteriolateral: 4. 1 ± 2. 2 months; p = 0. 69), and time to next procedure (midpatellar: 7. 3 ± 3. 3 months; anteriolateral: 7. 7 ± 3. 7 months; p = 0. 71). The anteriolateral portal was 97 % accurate by real-time ultrasound imaging. Conclusion The modified anteriolateral bent knee portal is an effective, accurate, and equivalent alternative to the standard lateral midpatellar portal for intraarticular injection of the knee.

40|$|Degenerative joint {{changes have}} been {{reported}} in human mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI) and are a prominent feature of feline MPS VI. Joint disease has proven refractory to intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in the MPS VI cat because enzyme is unable to reach cells in cartilage. In this study, enzyme was infused directly into the intraarticular space to determine whether joint tissues are able to respond to replacement enzyme. Clearance of glycosaminoglycans from chondrocytes was observed at a dose of 10 microg recombinant human N-acetylgalactosamine- 4 -sulfatase (rh 4 S), but greater clearance was observed with higher doses. The chondrocytes at the articular surface were cleared preferentially. Lysosomal vacuolation in cruciate ligament and synovial cells also decreased upon addition of rh 4 S. One month after injection of rh 4 S, a slight reaccumulation of storage was observed at the surface of the joint, but extensive reaccumulation was observed 2 mo after injection. These results indicate that by bypassing the synovium <b>using</b> <b>intraarticular</b> ERT, significant reduction in storage material in joint tissues can be achieved.

40|$|Herpes simples virus {{thymidine}} kinase (HSV-TK) expression plasmid DNA was {{injected into the}} joint space of rabbits with antigen-induced arthritis (AIA). Purified plasmid D N A was able to mediate transfection of synovial lining cells and transient overexpression of H S V- T K {{in the context of}} active synovial inflammation. The pharmacodynamic distribution of intraarticular expression plasmid D N A was confined to the joint space. Arthritic rabbits treated with intraarticular expression plasmid D N A followed by intravenous ganciclovir (G C V, 5 mg/kg) twice daily for 3 days showed histologic evidence of synovial lining layer cytolysis when ar-ticular tissues were examined 21 days posttreatment.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} advances in hip joint preservation surgery, accurate diagnosis {{and assessment of}} femoral head and acetabular cartilage status is becoming increasingly important. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hip does present technical difficulties. The fairly thin cartilage lining necessitates high image resolution and high contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). With MR arthrography (MRA) <b>using</b> <b>intraarticular</b> injected gadolinium, labral tears and cartilage clefts may be better identified through the contrast medium filling into the clefts. However, the ability of MRA to detect varying grades of cartilage damage is fairly limited and early histological and biochemical changes {{in the beginning of}} osteoarthritis (OA) cannot be accurately delineated. Traditional MRI thus lacks the ability to analyze the biological status of cartilage degeneration. The technique of delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC) is sensitive to the charge density of cartilage contributed by glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are lost early in the process of OA. Therefore, the dGEMRIC technique has a potential to detect early cartilage damage that is obviously critical for decision-making regarding time and extent of intervention for joint-preservation. In the last decade, cartilage imaging with dGEMRIC has been established as an accurate and reliable tool for assessment of cartilage status in the knee and hip joint. This review outlines the current status of dGEMRIC for assessment of hip joint cartilage. Practical modifications of the standard technique including three-dimensional (3 D) dGEMRIC and dGEMRIC after intra-articular gadolinium instead of iv-dGEMRIC will also be addressed...|$|R

Percutaneous treatment of these complex fractures is intended to reduce soft issue complications and postoperative stiffness of the knee joint. We assessed the complications, clinical outcome scores, and postoperative knee range of movements, after fluoroscopic assisted closed reduction and external fixator application. Materials and Methods: Seventy eight complex tibial plateau fractures in 78 patients {{were included in the}} study. All fractures were managed with closed reduction and external fixator application. In 28 cases with <b>intraarticular</b> split, we <b>used</b> percutaneous cancellous screw fixation for reduction and fixation of condylar parts. In nine open fractures, immediate debridement was done. In 16 cases, elevation of depressed segment and bone grafting was required, which was done from a very small incision. All patients were clinically and radiographically evaluated at a mean followup of 26. 16 months (range 6 - 60 months). Results: Clinical results were evaluated according to the Rasmussen′s criteria. Average healing time was 13. 69 weeks (range 12 - 28 weeks). Mean knee range of motion was 122. 60 ° (range 110 °- 130 °). Forty seven results were scored as excellent, 25 good, 2 fair, and 1 as poor.

40|$|Osteoarthritis of the metacarpo/metatarsophalangeal joints {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of poor {{performance}} in horses. Delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC) may be a useful technique for noninvasively quantifying articular cartilage damage in horses. The purpose of this study was to describe dGEMRIC characteristics of the distal metacarpus 3 /metatarsus 3 (Mc 3 /Mt 3) articular cartilage in 20 cadaver specimens collected from normal Thoroughbred horses. For each specimen, T 1 relaxation time was measured from scans acquired precontrast and at 30, 60, 120, and 180 min post intraarticular injection of Gd-DTPA(2 -) (dGEMRIC series). For each scan, T 1 relaxation times were calculated using five regions of interest (sites 1 - 5) in the cartilage. For all sites, a significant decrease in T 1 relaxation times occurred between precontrast scans and 30, 60, 120, and 180 min scans of the dGEMRIC series (P < 0. 0001). A significant increase in T 1 relaxation times occurred between 60 and 180 min and between 120 and 180 min post Gd injection for all sites. For sites 1 - 4, a significant increase in T 1 relaxation time occurred between 30 and 180 min postinjection (P < 0. 05). Sites 1 - 5 differed significantly among one another for all times (P < 0. 0001).

A trend was observed, however, in a subgroup of patients with high level of pain at baseline. Although these data may suggest cessation of IL- 1 therapy in osteoarthritis, other methods such as limited intraarticular anti-IL- 1 delivery should still be considered. One of the most exciting challenges in rheumatology for the future is to find a therapeutic target for osteoarthritis (OA) [1]. Indeed, clinicians and our patients are still waiting for a new drug that exhibits an analgesic effect and structure-modulating properties. OA is characterised by an imbalance between catabolic and anabolic responses of stimulated chondrocytes, driven locally by a soup of cytokines where IL- 1 β is regarded as the chief orchestrator. On the one hand, IL- 1 can induce the production of enzymes, prostanoids, nitric oxide and free radicals; on the other hand, IL- 1 can block the production of collagen type 2 and proteoglycans [2, 3]. IL- 1 is also involved in the transmission of pain [4]. Considering all these factors, targeting IL- 1 in OA seems a logical approach to slow down the disease progression.

40|$|Background and Aim: Severe {{pain and}} comfortlessness {{may be seen}} in {{patients}} after arthroscopic knee surgery despite various commonly administered analgesic methods, particularly based on local anesthetics. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of intraarticular levobupivacaine injected preoperatively on pain relief and time to first analgesic request during the postoperative period. Material and Methods: 40 adult-patients, ASA I and II, undergoing elective arthroscopic surgery were included in the study. Patients in the levobupivacaine group received intra-articular levobupivacaine at 5 mg/ml dosages and 20 ml total volume 30 min before the procedure. Patients in the control group received 20 ml of normal saline. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were assessed at the 1 st, 2 nd, 4 th, 8 th, 12 th and 24 th hour postoperatively. Time to first analgesic request and total analgesics used over the course of 24 hours after the surgery were recorded. All patients received continuous morphine infusion via patient controlled analgesia (PCA) devices postoperatively. Additionally, patients&# 146; pain satisfaction scores were recorded. Results: Lower VAS scores at the 1 st, 2 nd, 4 th and 8 th hours postoperatively - both at rest and during motion - were found in the levobupivacaine group compared to the normal saline group (p< 0. 001, p< 0. 001, p< 0. 001 and p< 0. 02 respectively). Time to first analgesic request was longer with the levobupivacaine group than the group with saline (22. 50 vs 15. 00 min, p< 0. 02). A significant difference was found in consumed total opioid doses (9. 10 vs 31. 75 mg, p< 0. 001). The number of analgesic demands using PCA were significantly different between groups (10. 80 v. s. 36. 1 times in 24 hours, p< 0. 001).

40|$|Allogenic tissue {{has become}} an {{important}} graft option for {{the reconstruction of the}} anterior cruciate ligament. Recent reports of disease transmission following ACL reconstruction with fresh-frozen non-sterilized allografts have highlighted the need for new sterilization techniques that do not impair the mechanical or biological properties as it was shown for most of the current sterilization techniques. Peracetic acid (PAA) has been successfully used to sterilize bone allografts without these disadvantages and does not impair the mechanical properties of soft tissue grafts in vitro 1. This study aimed to examine invivo the impact of PAA sterilization of soft-tissue grafts on the tendonbone incorporation in ACL reconstruction. We hypothesized that PAA sterilization would not interfere with tendon bone healing as compared to non-sterilized allografts during short-term healing in a sheep model. METHODS: 18 mature female merino sheep underwent open <b>intraarticular</b> ACL reconstruction <b>using</b> peracetic acid ethanol sterilized flexor tendon allografts. Following the surgical procedure immediate weight bearing was tolerated and normal gait was confirmed. Animals were followed for 6 and 12 weeks. Proximal tibia and distal femora were harvested and cut sagittally {{in the center of the}} expected tendon bone interface using a precision saw system. Cuts were embedded into PMMA for undecalcified histologies and 6 μm serial sections were created with a hard tissue microtome. Masson Goldner Trichrome (MG), a modified Safranin O-van Kossa (SOK) stain and Alcian blue (AB) techniques were used for visualization of the different tissue structures. Descriptive analysis of the specimens was carried out using normal light microscopy. Type and maturity of the tendon bone insertion was evaluated using the scoring system below. Results were compared with the results from our previous study, where we compared the tendon bone healing from fresh frozen allograft versus autograft in the same animal model using same time period and evaluating score. Scoring system for tendon- bone incorporation (TBI) : Stage :Description: 0 :No signs of direct tendon insertion (TBI); I:TBI with uncalcified chondroid cell formation; II:TBI with calcified chondroid cell formation; III: Immature direct TBI; IV:Mature direct TBI. RESULTS: No surgical complications occurred in 18 sheep. Full weight bearing was observed at an average of 14 days. After six weeks femoral and tibial specimens had similar findings in the PAA group Two of the samples showed no signs of a direct tendon bone insertion (stage 0). Two samples showed uncalcified chondroid cell formations located especially at the posterior bone tunnel aperture side (stage I). 4 Samples showed advanced tendon bone healing with a high number of chondroid cells in the tendon bone interface mainly located at the posterior bone tunnel aperture (stage II) One sample already showed an advanced immature direct TBI with multiple coloums of chondroid cells and wide zones of mineralization. Sharpey like fibers were found along the tendon-bone interface with an accumulation at the bottom of the bone tunnel Non-sterilized allografts showed a significantly lesser degree of maturation at 6 weeks of healing. At 12 weeks, the femoral specimens showed only few signs of progressive tendon bone healing. In the two specimens with stage II maturity, this healing was only observed at anterior site of the bone tunnel entrance. TBI stage III was found in one specimen with many chondroid like cells and a wide mineralization zone. The tibial specimens showed a more progressed maturity of the tendon-bone interface with 4 samples graded stage II and III. One specimen already resembled the typical distinct four transition zones of ligament, fibrocartilage, mineralized cartilage and bone. The expression of Sharpey like fibers increased along the graft bone interface in the femoral and tibial tunnel compared to 6 weeks of healing. Non-sterilized allografts did not show substantial differences in femoral tendon-bone healing at 12 weeks anymore. However, on the tibial side maturity of the tendon-bone interface was still reduced compared to PAA grafts. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge this study is one of the first reports analyzing the tendon bone healing of peracetic acid treated free soft tendon allografts in an in-vivo model of ACL reconstruction. Compared with the results from fresh frozen allografts from our previous study, the tendon bone healing of PAA treated tendons progressed earlier at 6 and 12 weeks. With advancing time, these differences were more pronounced on the tibial than on the femoral tendon-bone interface. It could be assumed that the improved tendon-bone healing of PAA grafts would provide advantageous mechanical properties. However, during mechanical testing we discovered significantly lower structural properties 2 in the PAA group. This observation underlines the importance of analyzing the biological healing of the tendon-bone interface and the intraarticular graft remodeling, which we found to be significantly delayed in PAA treated compared to non-sterilized allografts. Therefore, we cannot currently recommend PAA sterilization in ACL reconstruction...|$|R
