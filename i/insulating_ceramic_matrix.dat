40|$|In hybrid organic {{solar cells}} a {{blocking}} layer between transparent electrode and nanocrystalline titania particles {{is essential to}} prevent short-circuiting and current loss through recombination at the electrode interface. Here the preparation of a uniform hybrid blocking layer which is composed of conducting titania nanoparticles embedded in an insulating polymer derived ceramic is presented. This blocking layer is prepared by sol-gel chemistry where an amphiphilic block copolymer {{is used as a}} templating agent. A novel poly(dimethylsiloxane) containing amphiphilic block copolymer poly(ethyleneglycol) methylethermethacrylate-block-poly(dimethylsiloxane) -block-poly(ethyleneglycol) methylethermethacrylate has been synthesized to act as the templating agent. Plasma treatment uncovered titania surface from any polymer. Annealing at 450 °C under nitrogen resulted in anatase titania with polymer derived silicon oxycarbide ceramic. Electrical characterization by conductive scanning probe microscopy experiments revealed a percolating titania network separated by an <b>insulating</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>matrix.</b> Scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy showed predominant presence of titania particles on the surface creating a large surface area for dye absorption. The uniformity of the percolating structures was proven by microbeam grazing incidence small angle x-ray scattering. First applications in hybrid organic solar cells in comparison with conventional titanium dioxide blocking layer containing devices revealed 15 fold increases in corresponding efficiencies. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) -block-poly(ethyleneglycol) methylethermethacrylate and poly(ethyleneoxide) -poly(dimethylsiloxane) methylmethacrylate diblock copolymers were also synthesized. Their titania nanocomposite films were compared with the integrated blocking layer. Liner poly(ethyleneoxide) containing diblock copolymer resulted in highly ordered foam like structures. The effect of heating temperature rise to 600 °C and 1000 °C on titania morphology was investigated by scanning electron and force microscopy and x-ray scattering. Sol-gel contents, hydrochloric acid, titania precursor and amphiphilic triblock copolymer were altered to see their effect on titania morphology. Increase in block copolymer content resulted in titania particles of diameter 15 - 20 nm. In hybrid-organischen Solarzellen ist zwischen der transparenten Elektrode und nanokristallinen Titania-Partikeln eine Barriereschicht erforderlich, um elektrische Kurzschlüsse sowie auftretenden Stromverluste aufgrund von Rekombination an der Elektrodenoberfläche zu vermeiden. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird die Herstellung einer hybriden Barriereschicht vorgestellt, die aus leitfähigen Titania-Nano-Partikeln in einer isolierenden polymer-abgeleiteten Keramic besteht. Die Barriereschicht wird durch Sol-Gel-Chemie präpariert, wobei ein amphiphiles Blockcopolymer als Templat fungiert. Hierzu wurde ein neuartiges Polydimethylsiloxan, das das amphiphile Blockcopolymer Poly(ethylenglycol) methylethermethacrylat-block-poly(dimethylsiloxane) -block-poly(ethylenglycol) methylethermethacrylat synthetisiert. Durch Plasmabehandlung wurde die Titania-Schicht vom Polymer entfernt. Tempern bei 450 °C unter Stickstoff führte zu Anatas zusammen mit einer aus dem PDMS Block abgeleiteten Silizium-Oxycarbid-Keramik. Elektrische Charakterisierung der Leitfähigkeit durch Rastersondenmikroskopie zeigte ein perkolierendes Titania-Netzwerk, das durch eine isolierende Keramic-Matrix getrennt ist. Rastersonden-Kelvin-Kraftmikroskopie zeigte die Existenz von Titania-Partikeln auf der Oberfläche, welche somit eine breite Fläche zur Farbstoffaufnahme bereitstellt. Die einheitlichkeit der perkolierender Strukturen wurde durch "Microbeam Grazing Incidence Small Angle X-Ray Scattering" nachgewiesen. Die ersten Anwendungen an hybriden organischen Solarzellen haben gegenüber den konventionellen Anwendungen mit einer blokierenden Schichten von Titanium-Dioxide eine 15 -fache Effizienzsteigerung erreicht. Poly(dimethylsiloxan) -block-poly(ethylenglycol) methylethermethacrylat und poly(ethyleneoxid) -poly(dimethylsiloxan) methyl methacrylat diblock copolymere wurden ebenso synthetisiert. Ihre Titania-Nanocomposit-Schichten wurden mit der integrierten blokierenden Schicht verglichen. Die Blockcopolymere, welche einen linearen Poly(Ethylenoxid) Block enthielten ergaben dabei stark geordnete schaum-ähnliche Strukturen. Der Einfluss der Temperatursteigerung bis zu 600 °C und 1000 °C auf die Morphologie von Titania wurde durch Rasterelektronenmikroskopie und Rasterkraftmikroskopie sowie durch Röntgenstreuung untersucht. Sol-gel-Gehalt, sowie Säure, Titania-Präkursor und Triblock-Copolymer gehalt wurden dabei variiert, um deren Einfluss auf die Titania-Morphologie zu beobachten. Durch Erhöhung des Polymergehalts wurden Titania-Partikel mit Durchmesser von 15 - 20 nm gebildet...|$|E
