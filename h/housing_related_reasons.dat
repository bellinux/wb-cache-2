Participants were 79 undergraduate pre-service teachers. Qualitative content analysis using Nvivo software revealed that pre-service teachers do not actively participate in lessons because of several reasons which we classified under four main categories. They are, in order of importance, personal <b>reasons,</b> instructor <b>related</b> <b>reasons,</b> course <b>related</b> <b>reasons,</b> and classroom environment <b>related</b> <b>reasons.</b> Though personal reasons were {{at the top of}} the list, the most outstanding personal reasons i. e. negative attitudes towards course or department, lack of confidence or fear of making mistakes, and negative attitudes towards instructor were found to be affected mainly by two of the teacher related reasons: instructor's failure to build a good rapport with students and instructor's poor teaching skills in particular...|$|R

40|$|PosterAs {{a typical}} sector of social infrastructure, public housing {{in many regions}} is playing an {{important}} role in underpinning the well-being, social cohesion and economic growth, offering accommodations to large percentage of their population. However, management of such infrastructure assets faces great challenges across their different lifecycle stages—a small incident may exert a huge negative social impact or lead to a catastrophic economic loss due to the internal interdependency between public housing buildings and facilities and the external interdependency of public housing with other urban infrastructures. Whilst most available literatures on public housing now focus on discussions of higher strategies like privatization and decentralization, this paper commences the research of public housing management from infrastructure asset management (IAM) perspective to reduce the lifecycle and social cost and improve the transparency of public housing programs. Taking public housing in Hong Kong as cases, this study aims to examine the interdependency among public <b>housing</b> <b>related</b> infrastructure assets from multiple perspectives: from physical, functional and informational interactions to management practices. Semi-structured interviews are conducted with relevant stakeholders to chart out the interrelationships among different public <b>housing</b> <b>related</b> infrastructure assets and their management processes. A dependency matrix is developed to illustrate the interdependencies of different infrastructure assets. causal loop diagrams (CLD) are constructed to identify complicated interactions and feedback loops among interwoven public <b>housing</b> <b>related</b> infrastructure maintenance management processes. The matrix and the diagrams can be used to develop decision support tools for the management of public <b>housing</b> <b>related</b> infrastructure assets...|$|R
