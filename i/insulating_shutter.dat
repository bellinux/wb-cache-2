40|$|<b>Insulated</b> window <b>shutters</b> can lessen {{considerably}} {{the amount}} of heat lost through windows. A standard double-glazed window has a thermal resistance of about R 2 (RSI 0. 35). An <b>insulated</b> <b>shutter</b> with a resistance 2 to 3 times that of a window, say R 5 (RSI 0. 88), will reduce substantially the energy loss of that window, particularly at night when the house does not benefit from solar radiation. Many different kinds of window shutters are now available. This Note has been prepared as a guide in selection as {{there are a number}} of key points to consider to achieve an effective and relatively trouble-free operation of a window shutter.

2500|$|A BS1363 plug has two horizontal, {{rectangular}} pins for [...] and neutral, {{and above}} these pins, a larger, vertical pin for an earth connection. [...] Note, both line and neutral carry current and {{are defined as}} live parts. [...] The earth pin also serves to operate the basic shutter mechanism used in many sockets. [...] Correct polarity is established by {{the position of the}} earth pin relative to the other two pins, ensuring that the [...] pin is connected to the correct terminal in the socket-outlet. [...] Moulded plugs for unearthed, double-insulated appliances may instead have a non-conductive plastic pin (an <b>Insulated</b> <b>Shutter</b> Opening Device or ISOD) the same size and shape as an earth pin, to open the shutters. [...] When looking at the plug pins with the earth uppermost the lower left pin is line, and the lower right is neutral.|$|R

5000|$|A [...] "purely passive" [...] solar-heated {{house would}} have no {{mechanical}} furnace unit, relying instead on energy captured from sunshine, only supplemented by [...] "incidental" [...] heat energy given off by lights, computers, and other task-specific appliances (such as those for cooking, entertainment, etc.), showering, people and pets. The use of natural convection air currents (rather than mechanical devices such as fans) to circulate air is related, though not strictly solar design. Passive solar building design sometimes uses limited electrical and mechanical controls to operate dampers, <b>insulating</b> <b>shutters,</b> shades, awnings, or reflectors. Some systems enlist small fans or solar-heated chimneys to improve convective air-flow. A reasonable way to analyse these systems is by measuring their coefficient of performance. A heat pump might use 1 J for every 4 J it delivers giving a COP of 4. A system that only uses a 30 W fan to more-evenly distribute 10 kW of solar heat through an entire house would have a COP of 300.|$|R
2500|$|The {{regulations}} {{include a}} requirement that all plug types must be tested and certified by a nominated approval body (normally BSI, ASTA-Intertek or NEMKO). [...] They also require that all mains appliances for domestic use in the UK are supplied with approved BS 1363 plugs, {{but there is an}} exception for plugs fitted to shavers and toothbrushes which are normally a UK shaver plug (BS 4573) but may also be a Europlug (BS EN 50075). [...] The regulations also contain a provision for the approval of non-BS 1363 conforming plugs when [...] "the plugs are constructed using an alternative method of construction which provides an equivalent level of safety in respect of any risk of death or personal injury to plugs which conform to BS 1363 and is such that plugs of that type may reasonably be expected to be safe in use." [...] Certifying bodies have used this provision by developing their own standards for novel devices, thus allowing the introduction of innovative developments; an example is the plastic ISOD (<b>insulated</b> <b>shutter</b> opening device) which was originally approved against either an ASTA Standard or the BSI PAS 003 before becoming incorporated into BS 1363-1:1995.|$|R
40|$|High sound {{insulation}} ventilating windows (HSIVW) were recently proposed for noise control in buildings close to motorways or railways, where noise barriers are not effective or too expensive. These windows {{are characterized by}} good insulation performances {{and at the same}} time allow airflow through the window itself; such a performance matches summer indoor ventilation and refreshment needs. In the last years at the Acoustics Laboratory of the University of Perugia various prototypes were tested and their acoustic and airflow performances were assessed, also verifying the influence of filtering systems in the aerator. In the present paper a lot of experimental data are presented and in particular the results of a recent campaign, aimed at testing windows samples integrated with <b>insulated</b> rolling <b>shutter</b> boxes are presented. Sound reduction index R and single number sound reduction index Rw are evaluated, considering different exercise conditions; acoustic intensity measurements and analysis have also been performed, in order to verify the parts of the window which need to be optimized...|$|R
40|$|Retrofit <b>insulated</b> window <b>shutters</b> are examined. An initial {{investigation}} {{reveals that}} internal shutters are more viable in this context. Condensation {{is identified as}} a potential risk. Extensive investigations using modelling software as well as site and laboratory experiments are described which demonstrate that this risk is low. The thermal effectiveness of internal shutters is modelled and laboratory tested. Practical application This article results from research into the possibility of creating a retrofit thermal shutter system for existing commercial buildings. Building on earlier research, the paper examines whether this type of shutter is best fixed externally or internally to existing brick clad buildings and concludes that the latter is the best strategy. It then examines whether condensation between existing glazing and the outer shutter face is a problem and finds {{that this is not}} a significant issue. The way is clear for the development of this type of system as an alternative to costly triple glazing solutions...|$|R
40|$|An {{extended}} measurement {{campaign was}} carried out in order to investigate the characteristics of High Sound Insulation Ventilating Windows (HSIVW), a proper solution in all the cases where the intervention on noise sources results unfeasible, such as buildings strictly close to motorways or railways, as well as to industrial plants. The first series of tests was implemented on different HSIVW prototypes equipped with aerators (with and without fans); afterwards, a filter was inserted in the aerator, to make the inlet airflow cleaner. Finally, an <b>insulated</b> rolling <b>shutter</b> box was added to four different prototypes: two with an aluminum frame and two with a PVC frame. For all the surveys the sound reduction index (R) and the single number sound reduction index (RW) were calculated, in compliance with the ISO 140 / 3 method, giving complete informations about the performances of the whole window. The global campaign shows that the windows designed with particular details care present high sound insulation properties, even those equipped with critical components, such as aerators or rolling shutter boxes. The PVC frames show better performances than the aluminum ones, even if all the different types of windows show significantly high values of RW...|$|R
