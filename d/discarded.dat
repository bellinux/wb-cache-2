A significant portion of its diet may be scavenged from offal <b>discarded</b> by fisheries. This species is oviparous, with females producing encapsulated eggs {{two at a time}} year-round. The Izak catshark is regularly caught incidentally by a South African bottom trawl commercial fishery, but is <b>discarded</b> rather than utilized. Despite the fishing pressure, its population has been increasing and thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|Harmless to humans, the cloudy {{catshark}} adapts well to captivity and has {{reproduced in}} the aquarium. It {{is often used}} as a model organism in physiology research. On September 25, 1995, Masuda Motoyashi and colleagues used this species to perform the first successful artificial insemination of a shark or ray. The cloudy catshark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries with bottom fishing nets including trawls and gillnets, {{as well as on}} bottom longlines. Captured individuals are typically <b>discarded,</b> possibly with a high survival rate due to their hardiness. Some 40% of the fish <b>discarded</b> in Yamaguchi Prefecture fisheries are of this species. The bottom trawl fishery operating off Fukushima Prefecture may catch over a ton of cloudy catsharks annually, which are also <b>discarded.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{focused on}} trash fish and <b>discards</b> in push nets operated by local fishermen twice during day time at Samuut Prakan Province in Thailand. The push net catch {{was divided into}} three categories: commercial fish, trash fish and <b>discards.</b> Total weight of the catch, and body length and weight of the species were measured in each category. A survey of fishing gears and methods {{was carried out by}} interviewing fishermen. The catch was divided into <b>discards</b> (54 % of total weight), commercial fish (23 %) and trash fish (23 %). Almost 80 % of the <b>discards</b> were crabs, Charybdis affinis, while soapy, Leiognathus sp. accounted for 69 % of trash fish. In trash fish and <b>discards,</b> juveniles of commercial species were included, while almost all of soapy in trash fish were adults on their mean length.

40|$|Fisheries <b>discards</b> are {{an issue}} of general {{management}} and societal concern. This study presents the first analysis and characterization of <b>discards</b> composition from Iberian trawl fleets using Portuguese and Spanish onboard sampling programme data from 2004 to 2012. The allocation of observed trips into clusters with similar catch composition (landings and <b>discards)</b> is a useful procedure {{for the analysis of}} <b>discarding</b> levels of trips within each cluster and to understand the motives associated to those <b>discard</b> levels. In general, results indicate that Iberian <b>discard</b> rates are highly variable being low in some specific fisheries, but moderate to high in most trips. Although a high number of species is caught in these fisheries only few contribute to 95 % of total weight of catch. The main <b>discarding</b> motives identified are related to market forces and regulations. This work shows that no one-fits-all solution exists to the minimization of <b>discards</b> in Iberian trawlers and discusses an array of possible <b>discard</b> mitigation measures, namely the implications of the recently proposed EU-wide <b>discard</b> ban.

40|$|Fishery <b>discards</b> subsidise {{the food}} supply of a large {{community}} of scavenging seabirds, thus substantially influencing seabird ecology. Seabird preference for certain types of <b>discards</b> determines the number and composition of <b>discards</b> available for non-avian marine scavengers. To quantify both portions of <b>discards</b> temporally as well as spatially, {{we have used a}} modelling framework that integrates the spatial and temporal variation in seabird distribution, seabird attraction to fishing vessels, and <b>discard</b> distribution. The framework was applied to a case study in the Bay of Biscay, where a wide variation in <b>discard</b> consumption was observed across seabird foraging guilds, <b>discard</b> types, periods, and locations. Seabirds removed about one-quarter of the Bay of Biscay <b>discards.</b> The remaining sinking <b>discards</b> have limited potential to subsidize scavenging benthic communities on a large scale, but they may contribute substantially to scavenger diets on a local scale. Changes in food subsidies caused by <b>discard</b> mitigation measures, such as the “landing obligation” in the European Common Fisheries Policy, are likely to have ecosystem effects on both scavenging seabirds and non-avian marine scavengers...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} Bayesian age-structured stock {{assessment}} model {{that takes into}} account the information available about <b>discards</b> and is able to handle gaps in the time series of <b>discards</b> estimates. The mechanism for doing this is to explicitly incorporate a term in the model reflecting mortality due to <b>discarding,</b> and to make appropriate assumptions about how this mortality may change over time. The result is a stock assessment that takes due account of <b>discards</b> while, at the same time, producing a complete time series of <b>discards</b> estimates. The method is applied to the hake stock in ICES divisions VIIIc and IXa, which experiences very high <b>discarding</b> on the younger ages. The stock is fished by Spain and Portugal, and for these countries there are only <b>discards</b> estimates in recent and non-coincident years.
