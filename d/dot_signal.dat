In this study, {{the influence of}} conventional reverse-flow diafiltration on the yeast Hansenula polymorpha is investigated. Alternating 180 s of feeding with 360 s of non-feeding at a dilution rate of 0. 2 h(- 1) results in an oscillating <b>DOT</b> <b>signal</b> with an amplitude of 60 %.

30|$|To {{drastically}} reduce local motion {{events that}} might have guided the seal’s behavior due to the noise type and due to the long dot lifetimes mostly programmed in the coherent motion detection experiment {{as well as the}} coherent motion direction discrimination experiment using random direction noise, visual noise was additionally programmed as random position noise (Scase et al. 1996) for the final coherent motion direction discrimination experiment. In the random position display (Figure  1), only the <b>signal</b> <b>dots</b> were displaced and reappeared in the next frame. The noise dots were plotted afresh in each frame at random positions creating local motion signals of varying direction and speed by random pairings of dots in consecutive frames. Since the assignment of a <b>dot</b> as <b>signal</b> <b>dot</b> or noise dot changed from frame to frame, the probability that a <b>signal</b> <b>dot</b> survived N consecutive frames was pN[*]−[*] 1, where p is the coherence or correlation of the display (Britten et al. 1992). This way, the average lifetime of the <b>signal</b> <b>dots</b> decreased when the coherence of the display is decreased thereby reducing the spatiotemporal persistence of the local motion event. To create such a random position display, the frame rate of our software was coupled to the vertical refresh rate of our projector (60  Hz) and we calculated the position of the <b>signal</b> and noise <b>dots</b> every second according to the rules described above. Thus, each dot was visible for 1 / 30  s at a certain position and was then displaced by a fixed distance referring to a <b>signal</b> <b>dot</b> or plotted afresh at a new random position referring to a noise dot.|$|R

The number of <b>signal</b> <b>dots</b> was fixed at four and the number of noise dots was varied to establish the threshold signal-to-noise ratio required to determine the direction of the <b>signal</b> <b>dots</b> (up/down). The same <b>dots</b> remained <b>signal</b> <b>dots</b> over the three-frame motion sequence. The effect of different spatial patterns (square, horizontal line, vertical line, T-shape, random shape and no local grouping) and the interaction of contrast-polarity information, i. e. the interaction of the On and Off pathways, were investigated. To minimise the possibility of attentional tracking of the <b>signal</b> <b>dots,</b> the first motion frame contained 12 distracter patterns, i. e. noise dots arranged into the same pattern as the <b>signal</b> <b>dots.</b> Results indicate that performance is better for certain spatial arrangements than others and that contrast-polarity information appears to be pooled independently in the processing of the fixed-geometric shapes but not variable-shapes. These results are not due to differences in the spatial-frequency content of the stimuli and the use of a two-frame sequence ruled out attention-based tracking. This difference in the pooling of the On and Off pathways indicates that the different stimuli are processed by different systems, with the geometric conditions possibly being processed by a form-specific system...|$|R

Observers were asked to detect a signal composed of three dots moving in a linear trajectory among dynamic noise <b>dots.</b> The <b>signal</b> <b>dots</b> were collinear and equally spaced in a configuration that was either parallel to or perpendicular to their trajectory. The probability of detecting the signal was measured {{as a function of}} noise density, over a range of <b>signal</b> <b>dot</b> spacings from 0. 5 degrees to 5. 0 degrees. At any given noise density, the signal in the parallel configuration was more detectable than that in the perpendicular configuration. Our four observers could tolerate 1. 5 - 2. 5 times more noise in the parallel configuration. This improvement is not due merely to temporal summation between consecutive dots in the parallel trajectory. Temporal summation functions measured on our observers indicate that the benefit from spatial coincidence of the dots lasts for no more than 50 ms, whereas the increased detectability of the parallel configuration is observed up to the largest temporal separations tested (210 ms). These results demonstrate that dots arranged parallel to the signal trajectory are more easily detected than those arranged perpendicularly. Moreover, this enhancement points to the existence of visual mechanisms that preferentially organize motion information parallel to the direction of motion...|$|R

40|$|Quantum dots are a {{valuable}} tool in many research applications and commercial development. Their applications are far reaching and as such have become a topic of great interest. One of their greatest assets {{is the ability to}} utilize them as water soluble fluorescent labels. Rendering the nanocrystals water soluble can be accomplished in several ways, but one very popular method is by capping them with water-soluble multi-functional organic ligands. However, these ligands, when attached to the quantum dot surface, are labile and can be exchanged which can be problematic when using the quantum dots in research applications. This projects investigates the mechanisms of the exchange of surface bound ligands by employing modified fluorescent dyes as probes.

40|$|Background: Previous {{systems for}} <b>dot</b> (<b>signal)</b> {{counting}} in fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH) images have relied on an auto-focusing method for obtaining a clearly defined image. Because signals are distributed in three dimensions within the nucleus and artifacts such as debris and background fluorescence can attract the focusing method. valid signals can be left unfocused or unseen. This leads to dot counting errors, which increase with the number of probes. Methods: The approach described here dispenses with auto-focusing, and instead relies on a neural network (NN) classifier that discriminates between in and out-of-focus images taken at different focal planes of the same field of view. Discrimination is performed by the NN, which classifies signals of each image as valid data or artifacts (due to out of focusing). The image that contains no artifacts is the in-focus image selected for dot count proportion estimation. in fluorescence in situ Results: Using an NN classifier and a set of features to represent signals improves upon previous discrimination schemes that are based on nonadaptable decision boundaries and single-feature signal representation. Moreover, the classifier is not limited by the number of probes. Three classification strategies, two of them hierarchical, have been examined and found to achieve each between 83 % and 87 % accuracy on unseen data. Screening, while per forming dot counting, of in and out-of-focus images based on signal classification suggests an accurate and efficient alternative to that obtained using an auto-focusing mechanism.

Morse code symbols are variable length sequences of: <b>dot</b> <b>signals,</b> dash <b>signals,</b> and <b>dot</b> duration silent periods.

A high detection rate is possible even though the spatial and temporal characteristics (step size and frame rate) of the signal are identical to the noise, making the signal indistinguishable from the noise {{on the basis of}} a single pair of frames. The success rate 3 or detecting the <b>signal</b> <b>dot</b> was as high as 90 % when the probability of mismatch from frame-to-frame, based on nearest-neighbor matching, was 0. 3. Control experiments showed that trajectory detection is not based on detecting a “string” of collinear dots, i. e. a stationary position cue. Nor is a trajectory detected because it produces stronger signals in single independent motion detectors. For one thing, trajectory detection improves with increases in duration, up to 250 – 400 msec, a duration longer than the integration typically associated with a single motion detector. For another, the <b>signal</b> <b>dot</b> need not travel in a straight line to be detectable. The <b>signal</b> <b>dot</b> was as reliably detected when it changed its direction a small amount (about 30 deg or less) each frame. Consistent with this, circular paths of sufficiently low curvature were as detectable as straight trajectories.

40|$|Abstract Background Dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) is an {{important}} parameter for evaluating a bioprocess. Conventional means to measure DOT in shake flasks using fixed Clark-type electrodes immersed in the bulk liquid are problematic, because they inherently alter the hydrodynamics of the systems. Other approaches to measure DOT that apply fluorescing sensor spots fixed at the inside wall of a shake flask are also suboptimal. At low filling volumes for cultivating microorganisms with a high oxygen demand, the measured <b>DOT</b> <b>signal</b> may be erroneous. Here, the sensor spot is sometimes exposed to gas in the head space of the flask. Merely repositioning the sensor spot elsewhere in the flask does not address this problem, {{since there is no}} location in the shake flask that is always covered by the rotating bulk liquid. Thus, the aim of this prospective study is first, to verify the systemic error of Clark-type electrodes for measuring DOT in shake flasks. The second principle aim is to use the newly built "flexitube optical sensor" to verify potential errors in conventional optical DOT measurements based on fixed sensor spots. Results With the Clark-type electrode, the maximum oxygen transfer capacity in shake flasks rose compared to that of an analogous system without an electrode. This proves changed hydrodynamics in the system with the Clark-type electrode. Furthermore, regarding the sensor spot experiments under oxygen-limited conditions where the DOT value ought to approach zero, the acquired signals were clearly above zero. This implies that the sensor spot is influenced by oxygen present in the headspace and not only by oxygen in the bulk liquid. Conclusions The Clark-type electrode is unsuitable for measuring DOT. Moreover, the newly built rotating flexitube optical sensor is useful to verify potential errors of conventional optical DOT measurement techniques applying fixed sensor spots. </p...|$|E

40|$|Continuous {{processes}} are established in many industrial sectors such as steel, food or petrochemistry {{due to their}} cost effectiveness. Though they are characterized by their high space-time-yields, constant product quality as well as low downtimes, only a few continuous processes were implemented in the biotechnological pharmaceutical industry. This is caused by an increased complexity, a higher contamination risk and extensive regulations. Furthermore, in continuous biochemical engineered processes an additional cell retention system is required to achieve high product yields and to be economical competitive. In this regard, one option is the reverse-flow diafiltration, a membrane-based cell retention system. The membrane module is submerged in the bioreactor broth. Thus, cells are retained in their optimal environment minimizing shear stress and avoiding limitations such as oxygen. Over the submerged membrane product withdrawal and supply of fresh medium is alternated reducing a potential fouling layer. The objective of this work is to establish the reverse-flow diafiltration and modify its settings for different applications. At first, the membrane module was investigated regarding its biocompatibility. As there is no standardized analytical device or method to test biocompatibility, such a test method was developed within this work. The metabolic activity of various microorganisms was determined with the Respiration Activity MOnitoring Systems (RAMOS) {{as a function of}} the added amount of polymers commonly applied in biotechnology. Nylon and Polyamide 12, used in cable ties and tubing respectively, were found to delay and inhibit microbial growth. This is caused due to leaching of the plasticizer N-butylbenzenesulfonamide and the monomer 1, 8 -Diazacyclotetradecane- 2, 7 -dione, respectively, from the polymers. A metabolic activity inhibition threshold concentration between 4 – 10 g L- 1 Polyamide 12 tubing and approximately 40 g L- 1 Nylon was determined for the cultivation of the yeast Hansenula polymorpha, respectively. After the membrane module was proven to be biocompatible, a configuration of reverse-flow diafiltration was conducted with focus on maximization of space-time-yield and long-term filtration stability. Maximization resulted in an improved 4 -step mode of operation. Between each alternation of product solution withdrawal and supply of fresh medium one intermediate step empties the membrane. The two intermediate steps were adjusted and, thus, mixing of permeate and fresh medium could be prevented. Hence, fresh medium was saved while simultaneously dilution of the product solution was avoided. Long-term stability is achieved if the critical flux is not exceeded which is reached at a critical transmembrane pressure increase of 45 Pa min- 1. Optimal flux ranges for this process could be identified by a systematic flux step method: The critical flux for the yeast Hansenula polymorpha cultured in minimal Syn 6 medium and the mammalian cell line CHO DG 44 cultured in Power CHO 2 medium is 21 L m- 2 h- 1 and 9 L m- 2 h- 1, respectively. The required membrane area for long-term stable processes is determined based on this data. Reverse-flow diafiltration was successfully applied over a broad range of dilution rates for both, the yeast H. polymorpha secreting a single-chain antibody and the mammalian cell line CHO DG 44 secreting a full length antibody. The space-time-yield for H. polymorpha could be tripled in comparison to conventional continuous processes. Antibody transmission was above 80 % and viability was constantly above 85 % for this experiment. Application of reverse-flow diafiltration for CHO cells yields an antibody transmission between 40 and 60 %, which is a typical value for membrane-based cell retention systems in literature. Viability was constantly above 90 %. The transmembrane pressure was below the critical value for the culture time of over three weeks in both experiments indicating long-term stability. Thus, reverse-flow diafiltration proved to be an in situ cell retention device appropriate for cultivation of yeast and CHO cells. Conventional reverse-flow diafiltration pulses medium resulting in temporal heterogeneities. In microbial cultures especially the C-source alternates between depletion and excess, which leads to oscillations of the <b>DOT</b> <b>signal.</b> This effect is enforced at increased dilution rates. Artificially induced short-term oxygen limitations for H. polymorpha result in the formation of ethanol and a reduced product concentration of 25 %. To overcome this cyclic problem, sequential operation of three membranes is introduced. Thus, quasi-continuous feeding is achieved reducing the oscillation of the <b>DOT</b> <b>signal</b> providing a nearly homogenous culture over time. In this thesis, reverse-flow diafiltration proved to be a fail-safe, long-term stable, easy applicable in situ product recovery process with low investment costs and minimal equipment requirements. Space-time-yields could be enhanced remarkably. RFD proved to be especially suitable for shear sensitive cells or organism prone to oxygen limitation...|$|E

The stimuli consisted of noise dots whose individual directions were random and of <b>signal</b> <b>dots</b> moving in a unique direction. All dots moved at the same speed. For each condition, the nulling percentage (percentage of <b>signal</b> <b>dots</b> needed to perceptually null the MAE) was scaled with respect to the coherence threshold (percentage needed to perceive the coherent motion of <b>signal</b> <b>dots</b> without prior adaptation). The increase of these scaled values with the density of dots in the test stimulus suggests that MAE strength is underestimated when measured with low densities. We show that previous reports of high nulling percentages at slow speeds do not reflect strong MAEs, but are actually due to spatio-temporal aliasing, which dramatically increases coherence thresholds. We further show that MAE strength at slow speed increases with eccentricity. These findings are consistent with the idea that using this dynamic test stimulus preferentially reveals the adaptation of a population of high-speed motion units whose activity is independent of adapted low-speed motion units...|$|R

Significantly, HNO targets signaling pathways distinct from NO(center dot) with an ability to activate K(V) and K(ATP) channels in resistance arteries, cause coronary vasodilatation in part via release of calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP), and exhibits resistance to scavenging by superoxide and vascular tolerance development. As such, HNO synthesis and bioavailability may be preserved and/or enhanced during disease states, in particular those associated with oxidative stress. Moreover, it may compensate, in part, for a loss of NO(center <b>dot)</b> <b>signaling.</b> Here we explore the vasoprotective actions of HNO and discuss the therapeutic potential of HNO donors in the treatment of vascular dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe used biased random-dot {{dynamic test}} stimuli {{to measure the}} {{strength}} of the motion aftereffect (MAE) to evaluate the usefulness of this technique as a measure of motion adaptation strength. The stimuli consisted of noise dots whose individual directions were random and of <b>signal</b> <b>dots</b> moving in a unique direction. All dots moved at the same speed. For each condition, the nulling percentage (percentage of <b>signal</b> <b>dots</b> needed to perceptually null the MAE) was scaled with respect to the coherence threshold (percentage needed to perceive the coherent motion of <b>signal</b> <b>dots</b> without prior adaptation). The increase of these scaled values with the density of dots in the test stimulus suggests that MAE strength is underestimated when measured with low densities. We show that previous reports of high nulling percentages at slow speeds do not reflect strong MAEs, but are actually due to spatio-temporal aliasing, which dramatically increases coherence thresholds. We further show that MAE strength at slow speed increases with eccentricity. These findings are consistent with the idea that using this dynamic test stimulus preferentially reveals the adaptation of a population of highspeed motion units whose activity is independent of adapted low-speed motion units...|$|R
40|$|In situ {{hybridization}} {{has been}} widely used for localization of specific genes in interphase cell nuclei. The sites of signals, however, do not represent {{the activity of the}} gene transcription in the nuclei. To differentially localize genes in active and inactive states, the effect of nuclease digestion prior to in situ hybridization using PCR products of DNA fragments from human X-chromosome, as a probe DNA, was examined in female neutrophils. According to the conventional protocol for chromosomal in situ hybridization, we detected two <b>dot</b> <b>signals</b> in the nucleus. However, the use of Ca/Mg-dependent endonuclease, which extracts inactive gene DNA, resulted in the loss of the one signal of the outer region of the nucleus, but not that of the inner one. In contrast, when exogenous DNase I, which extracts active gene DNA, was used in place of Ca/Mg-dependent endonuclease, the inner signal, but not the outer one, was almost lost in neutrophils. Considering that the outer signal represents inactive X-chromosome DNA in the site of female neutrophil nuclei, these results indicate that the use of our modified protocol may enable us to discriminate the signals of active and inactive genes in interphase cells by in situ hybridization...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experiments}} was to investigate how manipulating the contrast of the <b>signal</b> and noise <b>dots</b> in a random dot kinematogram (RDK), influenced on motion coherence thresholds in adults with dyslexia. In {{the first of two}} experiments, coherent motion thresholds were measured when the contrasts of the <b>signal</b> and noise <b>dots</b> in an RDK were manipulated. A significantly greater processing benefit was found for the group with dyslexia than a control group when the <b>signal</b> <b>dots</b> were of higher contrast than the noise dots. However, a significant processing disadvantage was found for the group with dyslexia relative to the control group when the <b>signal</b> <b>dots</b> were of lower contrast than the noise dots. These findings were interpreted as supporting evidence for the noise exclusion hypothesis of dyslexia. In Experiment 2, the effect on coherent motion thresholds of presenting a cue that alerted observers to which stimuli, high or low contrast contained the <b>signals</b> <b>dots</b> was investigated. When the cue directed attention to low contrast <b>signal</b> <b>dots</b> presented in high contrast noise, coherent motion thresholds were only enhanced for the group with dyslexia. This manipulation produced equivalent coherent motion thresholds in the reader groups. In other conditions, the group with dyslexia had significantly higher coherent motion thresholds than the control group. It was concluded that adults with dyslexia who show evidence of a coherent motion deficit (37 % of the dyslexia group in each experiment), have a specific difficulty in noise exclusion. This appears to occur as consequence of a sensory processing deficit in the magnocellular or dorsal stream. Griffith Health, School of Applied PsychologyNo Full Tex...|$|R
