40|$|Firms are {{affected}} by the product demand. This leads to employment adjustments. In the literature we find only very few contributions investigating the issue whether internal adjustments are linked and which relationships exist with <b>external</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Are they of a complementary or substitutive nature? Furthermore, it is of interest to find out, whether we can observe an obvious trend and whether the adjustments are driven by cyclical movements. For this study we have an extensive data set of a large German manufacturing company, which supplies innovative products for the domestic and international market, provided on a monthly base from January 1999 to December 2005. The empirical analysis starts with descriptive statistics. We find that the employment adjustment cycle coincides only to a certain degree with the macroeconomic cycle. Internal and <b>external</b> <b>adjustments</b> are more characterized by complementarity than by substitution. Over the observed period we cannot detect analogous wage adjustments. It is noticeable that in 2003 compared with the years before the number of employees is substantially reduced. The econometric investigation is based on a two-stage approach. We start with a bivariate probit estimation in order to extract the relationship between the probability of overtime and of promotion. Unobserved variables have opposite effects on the former and the latter adjustment instrument. Furthermore, we detect a negative trend of internal employment adjustments. Cyclical effects are ambiguous. The next step, the determination of <b>external</b> <b>adjustments</b> with respect to overtime and promotion adjustments, is split into two estimates. On the one hand we do not distinguish between the type of <b>external</b> employment <b>adjustment</b> {{and on the other hand}} we use this information separating between quits, layoffs, workers with a cancellation agreement and with a transition into a transfer organisation. The first approach demonstrates that a promotion reduces the probability to leave the firm while overtime is positively associated with an external job change. This pattern holds generally speaking in the second, more detailed estimates. Quits are the exception. In this case we observe opposite effects. Finally, we cannot detect any influences of promotions on cancellation agreements. [...] Personnel records,overtime,promotion,job mobility,cancellation agreement,transfer organisation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} the exchange rate in U.

The effects of the exchange rate and relative prices on the trade balance are not symmetric even in the long run. Exchange rate feedback is insignificant and makes little difference in trade balance adjustment. There are also indications that the response of relative prices to the exchange rate shifted in recent years. Such changes seem to help explain the persistence of the U.

50|$|Inertial Guidance uses {{sensitive}} {{measurement devices}} {{to calculate the}} location of the missile due to the acceleration put on it after leaving a known position. Early mechanical systems were not very accurate, and required some sort of <b>external</b> <b>adjustment</b> to allow them to hit targets even the size of a city. Modern systems use solid state ring laser gyros that are accurate to within metres over ranges of 10,000 km, and no longer require additional inputs. Gyroscope development has culminated in the AIRS found on the MX missile, allowing for an accuracy of less than 100m at intercontinental ranges. Many civilian aircraft use inertial guidance using the ring laser gyroscope, which is less accurate than the mechanical systems found in ICBMs, but which provide an inexpensive means of attaining a fairly accurate fix on location (when most airliners such as Boeing's 707 and 747 were designed, GPS was not the widely commercially available means of tracking that it is today). Today guided weapons can use a combination of INS, GPS and radar terrain mapping to achieve extremely high levels of accuracy such as that found in modern cruise missiles.|$|E
50|$|Yet capital {{controls}} may have externalities: some empirical studies find that capital flows were diverted {{to other countries}} as {{capital controls}} were tightened in Brazil. An IMF staff discussion (Jonathan D. Ostry et al., 2012) note explores the multilateral consequences of capital controls, and the desirability of international cooperation to achieve globally efficient outcomes. It flags three issues of potential concern. First {{is the possibility that}} capital controls may be used as a substitute for warranted <b>external</b> <b>adjustment</b> (for example, when inflow controls are used to sustain an undervalued currency). Second, the imposition of capital controls by one country may deflect some capital towards other recipient countries, exacerbating their inflow problem. Third, policies in source countries (including monetary policy) may exacerbate problems faced by capital-receiving countries if they increase the volume or riskiness of capital flows. The paper argues however that if capital controls are justified from a national standpoint (in terms of reducing domestic distortions), then under a range of circumstances they should be pursued even if they give rise to cross-border spillovers. But if policies in one country exacerbate existing distortions in other countries, and it is costly for other countries to respond, then multilateral coordination of unilateral policies is likely to be beneficial. Coordination may require borrowers to reduce inflow controls or an agreement with lenders to partially internalize the risks from excessively large or risky outflows.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyze {{the nature of}} <b>external</b> <b>adjustments</b> in current account surplus countries. I ask whether a {{realignment}} of world growth rates [...] with Japan and Europe growing faster, and the U. S. growing more slowly [...] is likely to solve the current situation of global imbalances. The main findings may be summarized as follows: (a) There is an important asymmetry between current account deficits and surpluses. (b) Large surpluses exhibit little persistence through time. (c) Large and abrupt reductions in surpluses are a rare phenomenon. (d) A decline in GDP growth, relative to long term trend, of 1 percentage point results in an improvement in the current account balance [...] higher surplus or lower deficit [...] of one quarter {{of a percentage point}} of GDP. Taken together, these results indicate that a realignment of global growth [...] with Japan and the Euro Zone growing faster, and the U. S. moderating its growth [...] would only make a modest contribution towards the resolution of global imbalances. This means that, even if there is a realignment of global growth, the world is likely to need significant exchange rate movements. This analysis also suggests that a reduction in China's (very) large surplus will be needed if global imbalances are to be resolved. ...|$|R

But a broader and arguably better—Balassa-Samuelson-Penn (BSP) —framework for analyzing these adjustments paints a very diff erent picture.

We apply this framework to computing more appropriate measures of real competitiveness changes in Europe and other advanced economies {{in the aftermath of the}} recent global crises. Th ere has been a deterioration, not improvement, in competitiveness in the periphery countries be-tween 2007 and 2013. Second, the pattern of adjustment within the eurozone has been dramatically perverse, with Germany having improved competitiveness by 9 percent and with Greece’s having deteriorated by 9 percent. Th ird, real competitiveness changes are strongly correlated with nominal exchange rate changes, which suggests the impor-tance of having a fl exible (and preferably independent) currency for eff ecting <b>external</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Fourth, internal devaluation—defi ned as real competitiveness improvements in excess of nominal exchange rate changes—is possible but seems limited in scope and magnitude.
