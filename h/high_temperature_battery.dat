40|$|The {{background}} of the present studies relates {{to the development of}} a novel high temperature energy storage system based on a solid oxide cell.

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} to determine the corrosion behavior of nickel- 200 and AISI- 1008 steel in sulfur and sodium polysulfides (Na~Ss, Na 2 S 4, and Na 2 S 3) at 350 ~ for times between 1 and 25 h. Both the corrosion kinetics and the mor-phology of the corrosion scale formed on these metals are described. The corrosion of both metals is fast in these media, with the corrosion of nickel being up to {{twice as fast as}} that of iron. Changing the corrosion medium has little effect on the corrosion of nickel. The kinetics follow a logarithmic rate law in all cases, and the scale is multilayered with a porous inner layer. With the iron, however, the kinetics and the scale composition and morphology are significantly affected by the corrosion medium basicity. On going from sulfur through Na 2 S 5 and Na~S 4 to Na 2 S 3, the corrosion rate increases and the kinetics change from parabolic to almost linear while the scale changes from FeS/FeS 2 to a product of Na~FeS~ which appears as a band of small crysta]lites in the Na 2 S 3 next to the metal.

The SPE systems were characterized using Raman spectroscopy, broadband dielectric spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis, and electrochemical cycling in prototype cells, with a particular focus on the 83 wt% PEGMA system.

Although these cells cannot be considered as renewable as the fuel, hydrogen or carbon monoxide is consumed and not regenerated, the excellent reliability of such a cell can act as a stimulus to innovative development of similar cells with different outcomes. Molten salt electrolytes based upon LiCl - Li 2 O can be used to convert carbon dioxide, either drawn from the output of a conventional thermal power station or from the atmosphere, to carbon monoxide or carbon. Recently, dimensionally stable anodes have been developed for molten salt electrolytes, based upon alkali or alkaline ruthenates which are highly electronically conducting and these may allow the concept of <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>batteries</b> to be developed in which an alkali or alkaline earth element reacts with air to form oxides when the battery is discharging and the oxide decomposes when the battery is being recharged. Batteries using these concepts may be based upon the Hall-Heroult cell, which is used worldwide for the production of aluminium on an industrial scale, and could be used for load levelling. Lithium ion batteries are, at present, the preferred energy source for cars in 2050 as there are sufficient lithium reserves to satisfy the world’s energy needs for this particular application. Graphite is used in lithium ion batteries as the anode but the capacity is relatively low.

30|$|Another {{alternative}} for improving performance of RE-perovskite-type oxides in Ni/MH batteries {{is to prevent}} the aggregation of nanosized powders. The proposed solution consists of building up a coating {{on the surface of}} the oxide particles. An ideal coating for RE-perovskite-type oxides should possess multiple characteristics. For instance, it must help to avoid the aggregation of particles, be supportive in favor of hydrogen transfer, and provide protection against the alkaline electrolyte, especially at elevated temperatures. Recently, LaFeO 3 particles have been evenly coated with carbon and polyaniline (PANI) hybrid layers after carbon–PANI treatment [65]. The carbon layers prevent the nano-sized LaFeO 3 particles from aggregation. The PANI layers also enhance the electrocatalytic activity, facilitating hydrogen protons transferring from the electrolyte to the electrode interface. The cooperation of carbon and PANI hybrid layers results in a significant enhancement of the electrochemical performance at <b>high</b> <b>temperatures.</b> At an elevated temperature (333  K), the maximum discharge capacity of the LaFeO 3 electrodes increases remarkably from 231 to 402 mAhg− 1, which is significantly higher than the capacity values reported for AB 5 intermetallic alloys. Of course, the improvement achieved using RE-perovskite-type electrodes has been obtained at <b>higher</b> <b>temperatures</b> (310 – 333  K). Thus, these findings are of particular interest for the development of the next generation of high performing and <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> Ni/MH <b>batteries.</b>|$|R
30|$|Therefore, it {{is clear}} that RE-perovskite-type oxides present {{electrochemical}} reversibility for hydrogen absorption/desorption in alkaline media and can be regarded as alternative negative electrode materials for hydrogen batteries. Although its performance is affected by the temperature of the system, this fact should not be considered as a disadvantage in terms of a possible real application in hydrogen batteries. Many of the intermetallic compounds suffer degradation of its electrochemical capacity when they are used at <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> [89]. Instead, RE-perovskite-type electrodes can show very high capacities (over 400 mAhg− 1) at <b>high</b> <b>temperatures,</b> which could be extremely useful for example in <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> Ni/MH secondary <b>batteries.</b> Nevertheless, Young et al. [83] in a recent study reported promising high capacity values (around 370 mAhg− 1) using perovskite electrodes at room temperature (the compositions have not yet been disclosed). Of course, there is still work to do in terms of exploring new compositions and solving some inherent drawbacks that can limit its application.|$|R

The performance of LiFePO 4 based half-cells at 80 degrees C is promising, delivering ca. 160 mAh g(- 1) at 1 C, with a rate capability up to 4 C and ca. 98 % coulombic efficiency. The creation of hybrid IL/organic electrolytes by adding different organic cyclic carbonate solvents reduces viscosity of the electrolytes by 28 % at 80 degrees C, thereby improving the ion transport, and further improves the electrochemical performance; higher stability, better rate capability, and >= 99 % coulombic efficiency.

It is proved that use of the Peukert equation {{as a part of}} {{an analytical}} model leads to a restriction of field-of-use for those models as the Peukert equation is not applicable under small discharge rates. It has been also shown that in modern analytical models, the usually used temperature dependencies are not applicable at extremely low and extremely <b>high</b> <b>temperatures</b> of <b>battery</b> discharge.

In addition, <b>high</b> <b>battery</b> <b>temperature</b> and the associated cooling requirements can cause poor passenger thermal comfort, while extreme <b>battery</b> <b>temperatures</b> can negatively impact the power output of the battery, limiting the available electric traction torque. Avoiding such issues requires enabling battery cooling even when the vehicle is parked and not plugged in (key-off), but the associated extra energy requirements make applying key-off cooling a non-trivial decision. In this paper, a representative plug-in parallel hybrid electric vehicle model is used to simulate a typical 24 -h duty cycle to quantify the impact of hot ambient conditions on three performance attributes of the vehicle: the battery lifetime, passenger thermal comfort and fuel economy. Key-off cooling is defined as an optimal control problem in view of the duty cycle of the vehicle. The problem is then solved using the dynamic programming method. Controlling key-off cooling through this method leads to significant improvements in the battery lifetime, while benefiting the fuel economy and thermal comfort attributes. To further improve the battery lifetime, partial charging of the battery is considered. An algorithm is developed that determines the optimum combination of key-off cooling and the level of battery charge. Simulation results confirm the benefits of the proposed method...|$|R
