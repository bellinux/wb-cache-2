40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> acids {{as a source}} of plant nitrogen was examined in an Arctic coastal salt-marsh. Concentrations of inorganic nitrogen in salt-marsh soils were low relative to those reported for most temperate soils, whereas soluble organic nitrogen concentrations of salt-marsh soils were relatively high; the median ratio of <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> acid <b>nitrogen</b> as a proportion of ammonium nitrogen was 0. 36 and amino acid concentrations exceeded those of ammonium in 24 % of samples. Growth of the salt-marsh grass 'Puccinellia phryganodes' on glycine in a continuous flow hydroponic medium was similar to growth on ammonium ions at an equivalent concentration of nitrogen. Furthermore, in short-term excised root uptake experiments, rates of glycine uptake were equal to rates of ammonium and nitrate uptake combined when roots were provided with all three nitrogen substrates at equal concentrations. Amino acid uptake relative to ammonium uptake was favoured at high temperatures, high salinity and low pH. <b>Free</b> <b>amino</b> acids turned over rapidly in the soil, with half-lives in the soil solution ranging from 8 - 23 h for glycine, compared with ranges of 6 - 15 h and 6 - 16 h for ammonium and nitrate ions, respectively.

Research conducted within EC INCO-DC PROJECT “Improvement of the protein quality of sorghum and its introduction into staple food products for southern and eastern Africa ” showed that malting, in addition to improving the malt quality characteristics (e. g. diastatic power and <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>nitrogen),</b> improved the digestibility and quality of the protein, which generally increased with increasing malting time. In one of the sorghum varieties studied in vitro protein digestibility was improved by a staggering 110 %. Malting similarly improved other protein quality characteristics, including percentage protein, the nitrogen solubility index and the content of the first limiting amino acid, lysine. Soaking sorghum grain for a relatively short period during the steeping process in a dilute solution of NaOH was found to significantly improve the beneficial effects of malting in terms of diastatic power and <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and to marginally enhance the beneficial effect of malting on the protein quality and digestibility. It would appear that the simply technology of malting may offer a means by which to improve the quality and digestibility of sorghum protein...|$|E

At this point, the variety, availability and low price of gluten-free {{products on the market}} are of great importance. Sourdough is a traditional fermented semi-product that contains lactic acid bacteria (LAB). LAB are capable of metabolizing proteins and peptides with their proteolytic enzymes. It is predicted that gluten proteins are able to be hydrolyzed with the help of this proteolytic mechanisms and also by the wheat proteolytic enzymes. the help of this proteolytic mechanisms and also by the wheat proteolytic enzymes. gliadins involved in gluten intolerance during sourdough fermentation with selected LAB. First, sourdough fermentation with selected Lactobacillus strains was accomplished. As a control, dough with no inoculation and chemically acidified dough were prepared. During 48 h of fermentation, changes in pH, acidity, LAB concentration and <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>nitrogen</b> content were investigated. SDS-PAGE, 2 -D electrophoresis and RP-HPLC were applied to prolamins extracted from each sourdough sample taken at definite time intervals. The results showed that the inoculated LAB adapted to the dough environment and as they grew, a decrease in pH, and an increase in acidity and <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>nitrogen</b> were observed. According to SDS-PAGE, 2 -D electrophoresis and RP-HPLC results, some modifications in the protein patterns were observed in the inoculated doughs. The same alterations occurred in control and chemically acidified doughs, but not as fast as inoculated ones...|$|E
40|$|The {{terminal}} {{region of}} barley chromosome 5 HL controls malt extract, diastatic power, <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> acid <b>nitrogen,</b> alpha-amylase activity, seed dormancy and pre-harvest sprouting. Comparative {{analysis of the}} barley and rice maps has established that the terminal region of barley chromosome 5 HL is syntenic to rice chromosome 3 L near the telomere end. The rice BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome) sequences covering the region of chromosome 3 L were used to search barley expressed sequenced tags database. Thirty-three genes were amplified by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) with the primers designed from barley ESTs (expressed sequence tag). Comparison of the sequences of the PCR generated DNA fragments revealed polymorphisms including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), insertions or deletions between the barley varieties. Seven new PCR based molecular markers were developed and mapped within 10 cM in three doubled haploid barley populations (Stirling × Harrington, Baudin × AC Metcalfe and Chebec × Harrington). The mapped genes maintain the micro-syntenic relationship between barley and rice. These gene specific markers provide simple and efficient tools for germplasm characterization and marker-assisted selection for barley malting quality, and ultimately lead to isolation and identification of the major gene(s) controlling multiple quality traits on barley chromosome 5 HL...|$|R
40|$|Proteolysis and lipid {{oxidation}} in the vacuum-packed leg {{and breast}} muscles from Mullard drakes stored at 1 °C were studied. As proteolysis indicators there were determined proteolytic activity, contents of <b>amino</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> acids (FAA), and TBARS values {{as indicators of}} oxidative changes. Changes were also determined in the proteolytic activity, TBARS values and contents of: <b>amino</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and FAA. As a result, 18 FAA were found in breast muscles and 19 in leg and their total contents after 1 day of storage were 184. 39 mg/ 100 g tissue, and 233. 33 mg/ 100 g tissue (respectively). In the case of breast muscles {{a significant increase in}} the content of detected FAA (except Pro) was noted after 13 days of storage and in the leg muscles (except Asp) after 5 days of storage. It was established that the proteolytic activity decreased (ca. 38 %) in breast after 18 days and in leg (ca. 30 %) after 5 days of storage. The content of <b>amino</b> <b>nitrogen</b> significantly increased in breast muscles after 18 days and in leg muscles after 5 days of storage. During storage, TBARS values were observed to increase continuously in breast muscles, whereas in legs they first increased after 5 days and then were observed to decrease...|$|R
30|$|Degree of {{hydrolysis}} (DH) of all samples varied (Table  2). DH is {{the measure}} of the extent of cleavage of peptide linkages. DH close to 100  % means that all proteins in the sample are completely hydrolyzed to <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> acids (Panyam and Kilara 1996). DH of the samples was from 12.68 to 20.76  %. DH was in agreement with formal <b>nitrogen</b> content and <b>amino</b> <b>nitrogen</b> content. S 6 (Kapi Songkhla 1) and S 8 (Kapi Samut Sakorn) showed the highest DH (20.76  %) and S 10 (Kapi Chachoengsao) and S 11 (Kapi Samut Songkram) had the lowest DH (12.68 and 12.81  %, respectively). Due to different raw materials, processing condition and time of fermentation as well as different types or levels of proteolytic enzymes, varying degrees of cleavage were presumed. Products with different DH might possess different characteristics, taste, flavor, color and other attributes. <b>Free</b> <b>amino</b> groups available were able to undergo several reactions, e.g., Maillard reaction, thereby affecting the color or browning of products.|$|R
