5|$|Canada had {{originally}} planned to send two ski jumpers, Nels Nelsen and Melbourne McKenzie. Nelsen held world {{record for the}} longest ski jump. However, lack of funding meant that they planned for work for their fare on a freighter. These plans were stopped by officials from the British delegation, who organized the Canadian team and who felt working for their fare was <b>inappropriate</b> <b>and</b> not fitting for the team, and Nelsen never competed in any Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|About 1% of school-age {{children}} and adolescents have Tourette's. It was once considered a rare and bizarre syndrome, most often associated with coprolalia (the utterance of obscene words or socially <b>inappropriate</b> <b>and</b> derogatory remarks), but this symptom is present in only {{a small minority of}} people with Tourette's. The condition was named by Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) on behalf of his resident, Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette (1857–1904), a French physician and neurologist, who published an account of nine patients with Tourette's in 1885.|$|E
5|$|At 7:30am {{the next}} morning, the Duke of Wellington {{wrote to the}} Mayor of Liverpool from his lodgings in nearby Roby. He had been due to receive the Freedom of the City, but felt that under the {{circumstances}} any kind of celebration would be <b>inappropriate,</b> <b>and</b> {{said that he would}} not be attending any of the planned events in the city that day. The planned parades and ceremonial dinner were cancelled, but in the absence of rapid transit or mass communication there was no way to notify most of the city's population. While some shops had heard the news and remained shuttered, the ships in Liverpool's docks remained festooned with brightly coloured streamers, and sounded their horns at the time the Duke was expected to be passing.|$|E

5|$|The {{lack of an}} heir {{who could}} feasibly provide a new {{direction}} for the nation also threatened the long-term prospects for the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor's heir was his eldest daughter, Isabel, who had no interest in, nor expectation of, becoming the monarch. Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still a very traditional, male-dominated society, and the prevailing view was that only a male monarch would be capable as head of state. PedroII, the ruling circles and the wider political establishment all considered a female successor to be <b>inappropriate,</b> <b>and</b> PedroII himself believed that {{the death of his}} two sons and the lack of a male heir were a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted.|$|E
5|$|The line 8...Qa3 puts {{pressure}} on the white queenside pawns, pressure that may later be intensified with Nf6–e4.

5|$|When first {{exhibited}} in 1832, The Destroying Angel was widely praised for its technical brilliance, but critics were {{divided on the}} subject matter. Some praised its vividness and ability to mix fear and beauty without lowering into tastelessness; others criticised its thematic matter as <b>inappropriate,</b> <b>and</b> chastised Etty for wasting his talents. The painting changed {{the manner in which}} art critics viewed the artist; some saw it as indicating previously unseen character depths, others considered it a renunciation of his previous works. In 1854 Henry Payne, who had commissioned the painting, sold it to Sir Joseph Whitworth. Whitworth donated it in 1882 to the Manchester Art Gallery, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|Docter {{recruited}} a story crew to {{help develop}} the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, {{in an attempt to}} have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. They tried to stray away from stereotypically feminine interests, such as the color pink or dresses. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were <b>inappropriate</b> <b>and</b> scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.|$|E
5|$|The 14-day {{trial of}} Took began on 11 July 2005 before Justice Lai Kew Chai in the High Court. The {{prosecution}} relied on 76 witnesses, a video in which Took re-enacted the murder, forensic evidence and an autopsy that found several bruises on Huang Na's head. Based on the evidence, the prosecution alleged that Took lured Huang Na to the storeroom, then stripped and sexually assaulted her. After smothering and stomping {{on her to}} ensure her death, he stored her body in nine layers of plastic bags stuffed into a sealed cardboard box. The defence relied on the claim of diminished responsibility. Psychiatrist R. Nagulendran argued that Took was schizophrenic, as some of his behaviour, such as frequently smiling to himself and talking of spirits, was <b>inappropriate</b> <b>and</b> he had no motive for the murder – Nagulendran also called Took's story about the three Chinese men a delusion.|$|E

Compared to the speakers with AOSci, speakers with AOS had significantly fewer utterances meeting criteria for <b>inappropriate</b> stress, <b>and</b> significantly more utterances meeting criteria for <b>inappropriate</b> phrasing <b>and</b> <b>inappropriate</b> rate of speech. Discussion focuses on {{the implications of these}} three dissociations for the psycholinguistic locus of the stress deficit in AOSci including candidate loci within linguistic, motor speech, and self-monitoring processes...|$|R

This study surveyed <b>inappropriate</b> admission <b>and</b> inpatients in Imam Khomeini educational and treatment centre. We used the Appropriate Evaluation Protocol (AEP) to evaluate the appropriateness of 268 admissions and inpatients in Imam Khomeini educational and treatment centre. The petitions selected through random sampling as well as demographiccriteria of them were registered then for analysis of data was used from t-test and X 2 . Our findings showed that 6 % of admits and 8. 6 % of inpatients were in appropriate. There was remarkably association between <b>inappropriate</b> admission <b>and</b> disease diagnostic (p = 0. 038) but there weren`t any association between inappropriate inpatient with age, gender, type of insurance and disease diagnostic.

40|$|The {{effects and}} {{side effects of}} {{overcorrection}} for self-stimulatory behaviors of two children in a specialized day-care program were evaluated. For one child, a “hand” overcorrection procedure involving arm and hand exercises was introduced contingent upon <b>inappropriate</b> hand movements <b>and</b> later contingent upon inappropriate foot movements. After “hand” overcorrection was withdrawn for inappropriate foot movements, a “foot” overcorrection procedure involving foot and leg exercises was introduced contingent upon inappropriate foot movements. For a second child, the “hand” overcorrection procedure was introduced contingent upon inappropriate hand movements during a free-play period, and later contingent upon inappropriate vocalizations at naptime. “Hand” overcorrection was withdrawn and then re-introduced sequentially for both behaviors. Several concurrent behaviors were measured to assess multiple effects of treatment. Results for both children indicated the “hand” overcorrection procedure suppressed <b>inappropriate</b> hand movements <b>and</b> <b>inappropriate</b> behaviors that were topographically dissimilar. In addition, inverse relationships were observed between the second child's <b>inappropriate</b> hand movements <b>and</b> appropriate toy usage during free play <b>and</b> between his <b>inappropriate</b> vocalizations <b>and</b> <b>inappropriate</b> foot movements during naptime. Results suggest that overcorrection procedures that are effective for one behavior {{can be used to}} reduce the frequency of topographically different behaviors. This finding is discussed in terms of its practical implications for therapists...|$|R
