50|$|Even if global {{mutualism}} coextinctions {{are genuinely}} rare, conserving mutualisms {{may still be}} important for conservation. As mentioned previously, conservation {{is not just about}} preventing extinctions, but also about preventing species decline. Unlike with coextinctions, there are numerous recorded examples of where the decline or extinction of a species has led to the decline of its mutualist ("codeclines"). A documented example of a pollination mutualism breakdown leading to population declines is the <b>Indian</b> <b>Rubber</b> <b>Tree</b> (Ficus elastica) to its pollinator wasp (Pleistodontes clavigar) interaction. Habitat fragmentation has led to the F. elastica declining to very low population levels. However, F. Elastic can propagate clonally, so has remained extant. Meanwhile, P.clavigar is virtually extinct globally, because the mutualist relationship is probably obligate for P.clavigar (Mawsdley et al. 1998). An example of a seed dispersal mutualism breakdown causing population declines comes from two endemic species on Menorca Island. A frugiverous lizard (Podarcis lilfordi) is a seed disperser of a shrub (Daphne rodriguezii). When P. Lilfordi became extinct on Menorca, due to the introduction of carnivorous mammals, D. rodriguezii numbers declined significantly to endangered levels. This D. rodriguezii decline could be attributed to the local extinction of P. Lilfordi, due the lack of seedling recruitment on Menorca compared to other nearby islands, where P. Lilfordi remained extant and D. rodriguezii populations larger (Traveset and Riera 2005).|$|E

50|$|Natural rubber {{originates}} {{from the}} latex of the <b>rubber</b> <b>tree,</b> which is acquired by {{tapping into the}} bark layers of the <b>rubber</b> <b>tree.</b> <b>Rubber</b> <b>trees</b> belong to the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae) and only survive in hot, humid tropical climates near the equator, so the majority of latex is produced in the Southeast Asian countries of Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia.|$|R
40|$|Phloem turgor {{pressure}} (PTP) is the initial driving force for latex flow after a <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> is tapped and therefore {{plays an important}} role in <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> latex production. Variation in PTP with <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> clone, age, yield potential and commonly used Ethrel (an ethylene releaser) stimulation have, however, not been comprehensively studied to date. The aim of this study was to investigate these relations and examine whether PTP can be used as an index for <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> clone assessment and tapping system optimization. The results showed that: (1) the daily change of PTP in the foliation season suggests that a high PTP can ensure a high latex yield and tapping could be moved forward to midnight or earlier in the night; (2) the decrease of PTP from the basal to distal stem indicates the benefit of a controlled upward tapping system; (3) the logarithmic increase in PTP with <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> planting age and age-based mean girth suggests that the preferred age for the commencement of <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> tapping is eight years; (4) the change of PTP with regenerated bark age suggests that the regenerated bark could be exploited again after the second year; (5) PTP is positively related to the yield potential of <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> clones; (6) although Ethrel stimulation could not significantly increase the initial PTP of a <b>rubber</b> <b>tree,</b> it delays the recovery of PTP after tapping. Therefore, PTP is an indicator of <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> latex yield and can be used for tapping system optimization. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

40|$|Regarding <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> plantations, {{researchers}} lack a {{basic understanding}} of soil microbial communities; specifically, little is known about whether or not soil microbial variation is correlated with succession in these plantations. In this paper, we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene to investigate the diversity and composition of the soil bacterial communities in a chronosequence of <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> plantations that were 5, 10, 13, 18, 25, and 30 years old. We determined that: (1) Soil bacterial diversity and composition show changes over the succession stages of <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> plantations. The diversity of soil bacteria were highest in 10, 13, and 18 year-old <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> plantations, followed by 30 year-old <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> plantations, whereas 5 and 25 year-old <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> plantations had the lowest values for diversity.

As far as we know, none of the resistance genes related to powdery mildew have been isolated from the <b>rubber</b> <b>tree.</b> There is little information available {{at the molecular level}} regarding how a <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> develops defense mechanisms against this pathogen. We have studied <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> mRNA transcripts from the resistant RRIC 52 cultivar by differential display analysis. Leaves inoculated with the spores of O. heveae were collected from 0 to 120 hpi in order to identify pathogen-regulated genes at different infection stages. We identified 78 <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> genes that were differentially expressed during the plant–pathogen interaction. BLAST analysis for these 78 ESTs classified them into seven functional groups: cell wall and membrane pathways, transcription factor and regulatory proteins, transporters, signal transduction, phytoalexin biosynthesis, other metabolism functions, and unknown functions. The gene expression for eight of these genes was validated by qRT-PCR in both RRIC 52 and the partially susceptible Reyan 7 - 33 - 97 cultivars, revealing the similar or differential changes of gene expressions between these two cultivars.

In {{contrast to the}} vast information on miRNAs from many economically important plants, almost nothing has been reported on the identification or analysis of miRNAs from <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> (Hevea brasiliensis L.), the most important natural rubber-producing crop. To identify miRNAs and their target genes in <b>rubber</b> <b>tree,</b> high-throughput sequencing combined with a computational approach was performed. Four small RNA libraries were constructed for deep sequencing from mature and young leaves of two <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> clones, PB 260 and PB 217, which provide high and low latex yield, respectively. 115 miRNAs belonging to 56 known miRNA families were identified, and northern hybridization validated miRNA expression and revealed developmental stage-dependent and clone-specific expression for some miRNAs.

The high level of the outcrossing rate show that pollinations are realized between trees of different genotypes. The fixation index (FIS) decrease from the parental population to the descendantʼs one where it is not significantly different from zero. So crossings are panmictics, and the fertilizations between the related trees are practically inexistent. The rate of self-fertilization is mostly due to the real self-fertilizations between the ovuls and the pollen coming from the same origin. Thus, considering the results, the pollination in the seeds orchard would be favorable to the realization of substantial genetic progress in the wild <b>rubber</b> <b>trees</b> population...|$|R
