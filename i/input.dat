40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} selecting optimal <b>inputs</b> of neural networks without lowering recognition rate. In general, neural networks learn a recognition algorithm from <b>inputs</b> and their desired outputs. But if some <b>inputs</b> are redundant, namely they are expressed by other <b>inputs</b> fed to the networks or they do not contribute to recognition, their effect on the recognition algorithm, or their sensitivity to outputs {{is considered to be}} very small. Therefore, by analyzing input-output sensitivity of neural networks, redundant <b>inputs</b> can be deleted. Repeatedly applying this method, the optimal <b>inputs</b> can be selected. For an experimental neural network for number recognition with 12 feature <b>inputs,</b> the <b>inputs</b> could be reduced to 8 without lowering recognition rate...|$|R

5|$|The {{heterodyne}} technique {{is used for}} (1) shifting an <b>input</b> signal into a new frequency range as well as (2) amplifying a weak <b>input</b> signal (assuming use of an active mixer). A weak <b>input</b> signal of frequency f1 is mixed with a strong reference frequency f2 from a local oscillator (LO). The nonlinear combination of the <b>input</b> signals creates two new signals, one at the sum f1+f2 of the two frequencies, and the other at the difference f1−f2. These new frequencies are called heterodynes. Typically {{only one of the}} new frequencies is desired, and the other signal is filtered out of the output of the mixer. The output signal will have an intensity proportional to the product of the amplitudes of the <b>input</b> signals.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{sequential}} innovation in which an innovator uses several research <b>inputs</b> to invent a new good. These <b>inputs,</b> in turn, must be invented {{before they can be}} used by the final innovator. As a consequence, the degree of patent protection affects the revenues and cost of the innovator, but also determines the incentives to invent the research <b>inputs</b> in the first place. We study the effects of increases in the number of required <b>inputs</b> on innovation activity and optimal patent policy. We find that the probability of introducing the final innovation decreases (increases) as the number of <b>inputs</b> increases when <b>inputs</b> are complements (substitutes). We also find that the optimal strength of patents on research <b>inputs</b> is increasing in the degree of substitution between the <b>inputs,</b> but decreasing in the number of <b>inputs</b> for any degree of substitution. ...|$|R

Most applications deliberately force an odd number of <b>inputs</b> so they don't have to deal with the question of what happens when exactly half the <b>inputs</b> are 0 and exactly half the <b>inputs</b> are 1. The few systems that calculate the majority function on an even number of <b>inputs</b> are often biased towards [...] "0"—they produce [...] "0" [...] when exactly half the <b>inputs</b> are 0 -- for example, a 4-input majority gate has a 0 output only when two or more 0's appear at its <b>inputs.</b> In a few systems, a 4-input majority network randomly chooses [...] "1" [...] or [...] "0" [...] when exactly two 0's appear at its <b>inputs.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{computational}} {{technique is}} described for {{calculation of the}} interspike interval and poststimulus time histograms for the responses of an integrate-and-fire model to arbitrary <b>inputs.</b> The effects of the model parameters on the response statistics were studied systematically. Specifically, the probability distribution of the membrane potential was calculated {{as a function of}} time, and the mean interspike interval and PST histogram were calculated for arbitrary <b>inputs.</b> For stationary <b>inputs,</b> the regularity of the output was studied in detail for various model parameters. For nonstationary <b>inputs,</b> the effects of the model parameters on the output synchronization index were explored. The results show that enhanced synchronization in response to low-frequency stimuli required a large number (n> 25) of weak <b>inputs.</b> Irregular responses and a linear input-output rate relationship required strong (but subthreshold) <b>inputs</b> with a small time constant. A model cell with mixed-amplitude synaptic <b>inputs</b> can respond to stationary <b>inputs</b> irregularly and have enhanced synchronization to nonstationary <b>inputs</b> that are phase-locked to lowfrequency <b>inputs.</b> Both of these response properties have been reported for some cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus in the auditory brainstem. ...|$|R

Second, in a closed loop, negative feedback configuration, the <b>input</b> offset voltage is amplified along with the signal and this may pose a problem if high precision DC amplification is required or if the <b>input</b> signal is very small.|$|E

30|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the relevance of}} these scores in the input–output network, we develop the concepts in the context. First suppose production of sector j increases due to a shock on final demand. This initiates two chains of effects. On the one hand, sector j increases its demand for <b>inputs.</b> This demand is matched {{by an increase in}} the supply of <b>inputs</b> of j’s suppliers. In {{order to be able to}} increase supply of <b>inputs,</b> j’s suppliers had to increase production, which in turn, means an increase in demand of <b>inputs,</b> including the output of sector j, and so on. On the other hand, other chain of effects starts because there is more output available to be used as <b>inputs</b> after sector j increased it demand. This means that sector j increases its supply of <b>inputs</b> for other sectors. With more <b>inputs</b> available, the other sectors purchase more <b>inputs</b> and increase production. This increase in production, in turn, increases the supply of <b>inputs,</b> and so on.|$|R

25|$|<b>Input</b> current: Due to biasing {{requirements}} or leakage, a {{small amount}} of current (typically ~10 nanoamperes for bipolar op-amps, tens of picoamperes (pA) for JFET <b>input</b> stages, and only a few pA for MOSFET <b>input</b> stages) flows into the inputs. When large resistors or sources with high output impedances are used in the circuit, these small currents can produce large unmodeled voltage drops. If the <b>input</b> currents are matched, and the impedance looking out of both inputs are matched, then the voltages produced at each <b>input</b> will be equal. Because the operational amplifier operates on the difference between its inputs, these matched voltages will have no effect. It is more common for the <b>input</b> currents to be slightly mismatched. The difference is called <b>input</b> offset current, and even with matched resistances a small offset voltage (different from the <b>input</b> offset voltage below) can be produced. This offset voltage can create offsets or drifting in the operational amplifier.|$|E
