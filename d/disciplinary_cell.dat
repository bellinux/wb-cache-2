5000|$|... d) On March17, {{information}} about beatings of inmates and killing of Taras Voytsekhovsky in Bucha correctional facility {{was published in}} Ukrainian on-line media. “As became known, on March 16, 2012 a man was killed in Bucha correctional facility № 85 in Kyiv oblast’. A convict was killed in BCF; another inmate is in the hospital. They were beaten by the facility staff.” -informed the source.” The deceased Taras Voytsekhovsky was born in 1985. Another victim - Serhiy Telima, born in 1987, {{ended up in the}} hospital {{as a result of the}} beating”. Another source informed that the facility administration tries to hide the fact of beating. The officials claim that, instead of a quarrel between intoxicated convicts and their guards an ethylene poisoning of the convicts actually occurred. The journalist of Kharkiv human rights’ protection group informational bulletin “Human Rights” A.Didenko together with the lawyer O.Sapozhnikova conducted their own investigation and, having talked with a victim and witnesses, found out the following: “The deputy warden of the CF detained Voytsekhovsky and Telima around 6:00 pm. They were put into a cage-like room and the facility guards started beating them. The sergeants known among convicts as “Styopa Voropay, Karate-man and Leonidovich”, as well as the first deputy of the warden Lohovitsky participated in the beating. Serhiy was kicked in the stomach (liver area) and collapsed. They resuscitated him pouring water on him. They first beat Taras in the “cage”, then dragged him “like a bag”, unconscious into the <b>disciplinary</b> <b>cell,</b> located about 60 m from the main building. Serhiy came to his senses in the hospital unit, where he is currently staying, complaining of liver ache, nausea and vomiting, while Taras did not survive tortures and died. The evidence of numerous injuries was found on his body.” The witnesses under condition of their anonymity testified that they heard the screams and sounds of beating taking place inside the premises. The SPSU, nevertheless, divulged another version of the incident. The prisoners, allegedly, consumed alcoholic beverages of bad quality and suffered injuries as a result of numerous fallings. The administration also put psychological pressure on Taras’ mother. As a result, the body was cremated immediately. However, while the body was in the morgue, the journalists managed to take pictures of Taras Voytsekhovsky’s disfigured face. The photos were made public and attached to the petition to the Prosecutor’s office requesting criminal investigation. The Prosecutor’s office refused to instigate proceeding due to the lack of corpus delicti in the staff’s action. Nota bene - in its Decision on the case “Kaverzin vs. Ukraine” the European Court pointed out that the lack of efficient investigation of the torture by the Prosecutor’s office in Ukraine is a systemic violation of Article 3 of the Convention for Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.|$|E

MethodsWe {{collected}} data on the periods of imprisonment of all adult males incarcerated in France between 1 January, 2006 and 15 July, 2009. We used survival analyses from the incarceration to its end, censored by the observation period. We calculated suicide rates and performed a Cox model to assess the link between prisoners’ imprisonment characteristics and suicide risk. ResultsOverall, 301, 611 periods of imprisonment were observed and 353 suicides were recorded. The suicide rate was 17. 9 suicides per 10, 000 person-years (95 % CI: 16. 1 – 19. 9). The hazard ratio (HR) of suicide risk was high for placements in a <b>disciplinary</b> <b>cell</b> (15. 7, 95 % CI: 10. 6 – 23. 5) and varied depending on the main offence (homicide: 7. 6, 95 % CI: 5. 3 – 10. 9, rape: 4. 6, 95 % CI: 3. 2 – 6. 6, other sexual assault: 2. 9, 95 % CI: 1. 9 – 4. 6, other violent offence: 2. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 5 – 2. 8, compared with other offences). HR was lower when visits from relatives were observed (0. 4, 95 % CI: 0. 3 – 0. 5) and higher if a hospitalization was observed (1. 6, 95 % CI: 1. 3 – 2. 0). After conviction, HR halved with respect to the remand period, but there was no difference by sentence length. HR was higher if incarceration occurred after age 30 (1. 4, 95 % CI: 1. 1 – 1. 7). Foreigners tended to have lower risks than French prisoners, with the exception of those incarcerated for rape. ConclusionsThe suicide rate in prison is generally much higher than in the general population. This study has replicated previous international findings, highlighting the impact of the type of offence on suicide risk. Suicide prevention programmes must consider the high risk associated with incarceration for a criminal offence against a person. With regard to the impact of visits from relatives and placements in a <b>disciplinary</b> <b>cell,</b> further work should be conducted from a psychological perspective to examine the effects of physical and social isolation...|$|E

E.g. the issues of short-term and long-term visits, confidentiality of correspondence, conditions and restrictions imposed in the <b>disciplinary</b> <b>cells</b> etc. have not been resolved.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2016 Gelecekte insan hayatını kökten değiştirebilecek ilerlemeler, mimarlık, bilim ve teknoloji alanlarında yapılan çalışmaları oldukça etkilemektedir. Günümüzün çoğulcu ortamında, bir takım mimarlar ve bilim insanları, insan hayatını ve özellikle mimarlığı önemli biçimde etkileyebilecek bu yeniliklerin farkına varıp, bu doğrultuda ana akım mimarlık paradigmalarına alternatif mimarlık söylemleri ve pratikler oluşturmaktadır. Tez çalışması, tam da bu mimari söylemler ve pratikler aralığında gerçekleştirilmektedir. Genetik bilimi ve teknolojisindeki gelişmeler, geleceğe dair mimarlık söylemlerini oluşturan önemli etkenlerdendir. Burada “geleceğe dair” ifadesi ile kastedilen, bu söylemlerin önerdikleri mimarlıkların, bir çok farklı disiplinle bir arada olması ve bu bir aradalıkta gerçekleştirilen araştırmaların, tezin gerçekleştirildiği zaman dilimine göre, ilerlemesi ve geliştirilmesine ihtiyaç duyulmasıdır. Genetik-Mimarlıklar olarak adlandırılan bir söylemler grubu, çok genel olarak ifade edilirse, biyolojik paradigma bağlamındaki ilerlemelerin mimarlığa etkisini araştırmaktadır. Genetik-Mimarlıklar içindeki farklı söylemlerde bir çok kavram, farklı disiplinlerden mimarlığa aktarılmakta ve bu kavramlarla geleceğin olası mimarlıkları için düşünce sistemleri oluşturulmaktadır. Çalışmanın ana iskeletini oluşturan, Neoplazmatik-Tasarım ve Protohücre (Protocell) -Mimarlığı, geleceğe dair iki mimarlık söylemidir. Her iki söylem de, tez çalışmasında Genetik-Mimarlıklar kapsamında incelenmiştir. Neoplazmatik-Tasarım ve Protohücre-Mimarlığı söylemleri, biyoloji ve kimya gibi disiplinlerle kurulan işbirlikleriyle oluşan mimarlık pratiklerinin ortaya çıkmasında malzeme teknolojilerine odaklanmaktadır. Neoplazma olarak adlandırılan, kısmen kontrol edilebilen yarı-canlı materyallerin mimarlık pratiğinde kullanılma olasılığının, insan yaşamında ve mimarlıkta ortaya koyabileceği pek çok yenilik, Neoplazmatik-Tasarım’ın temel ilgi alanı olmuştur. Protohücre-Mimarlığı ise, diğer söylemin biyoloji disiplini doğrultusunda araştırdığı materyal yeniliklerini, genetik biliminden farklı olarak sentetik biyoloji, kimya ve fizik disiplinlerindeki gelişmelerden biri olan, canlı-gibi diye nitelendirilen Protohücre’ler doğrultusunda incelemektedir.   Tez çalışmasında, birbirleriyle ilişkili iki söylem olan Neoplazmatik-Tasarım ve Protohücre-Mimarlığı’nın sistematik olarak karşılaştırması yapılacaktır. Yapılan karşılaştırmalara göre iki söylem arasındaki farklılılar ve benzerliklerin, iki söylemin etkileri, potansiyelleri ve risklerinin ortaya konulması hedeflenmektedir. Çalışmada, bu söylemlerin gelecekte gerçekten tarif edildikleri gibi yeni mimarlıklar olarak uygulama alanı bulup bulmamaları sorusunun cevaplanması hedeflenmemiştir. Daha ziyade, bu çalışma mimarlık, bilim ve teknoloji arakesitinde meydana gelen değişimler sonucu ortaya çıkan karmaşıklığın, sınırlı bir çerçevede temsil edilmesi, fotoğrafının çekilmesi amacıyla gerçekleştirilmektedir. The progress, {{which can}} radically change people’s {{life in the}} future, greatly affects studies in the common field of architecture, science and technology. In this way, {{scientists}} and thinkers undertake the tasks suchs as making visible the deeper meaning of human existence and understanding and redefining human’s nature. These people who discuss these developments, {{can be defined as}} new-generation-intellectuals. The subjects which are dealt by the people who works on science and technology, inevitably require the opening of the borders between different <b>disciplinaries.</b> Stem <b>cell</b> research, cloning, sequencing the human genome and artificial intelligence are some of the examples for these subjects. In this pluralist environment, a team of architects and scientists notice the innovations which can affect greatly human’s life and especially architecture. In this direction, they constitute architectural discourses and practices which are developed thanks to expanding relationships between architecture and other disciplinaries such as biology, chemistry etc. Advances in genetic science and technology, have a very significant effect on the occurence of the possible architectural discourses of the future. Generally speaking, in a group of discourses which is called Genetic-Architectures, the effect of advances in the context of biological paradigm on architecture is investigated. Various notions in Genetic-Architectures are borrowed from different disciplinaries such as biology, chemistry and medicine. With these notions, new thinking systems are generated for the architectural discourses which can be described as marginal according to main paradigms in architecture. The thoughts which are created in the different discourses, sometimes intersect each other and also sometimes those are seperated from each other. When these thoughts intersect each other, there can be homogenizations, affinities and antipoles. Genetic-Architectures propose a major way of thinking which can possibly generate a breaking point for architecture. In the form-oriented-architecture, the material is seen as a tool, which is dictated by architectural form. Genetic-Architectures are process-oriented. In the process-oriented-architecture, architectural form emerges from specific correlations in which the material is controlled, manipulated and grown. As mentioned above, architecture’s expanding relations with other disciplinaries such as biology and chemistry, leads it to the formation of different perspectives and manifacturing techniques. The thesis study is carried out exactly in the range of these architectural discourses and practices, which are affected by the given expanding relations. Neoplasmatic-Design and Protocell-Architecture are two futuristic architectural discourses, which constitute the main framework of the thesis. Here, the word “future” refers that these discourses which describe different practices from the main paradigms of architecture, are not yet fully reflected on the dimension of reality. According to its proposals for architectural practice and discourse, Neoplasmatic-Design belongs to the Genetic-Architectures. Protocell-Architecture uses the technology of Protocells which is unrelated with DNA and outside the boundaries of genetics. Because of that, Protocell-Architecture is partially not included in the scope of Genetic-Architectures. Still, {{in the context of the}} thesis, Protocell-Architecture is accepted as it is included in Genetic-Architectures, because those have a great common area in architectural thinking and practice. Both Neoplasmatic-Design and Protocell-Architecture, focus on material technologies while developing the approaches which is affected by the expanding researches at the intersection of different disciplinaries, for possible architectures of the future. The potentials of Neoplasms which are partly grown and partly engineered, semi-living materials for architectural practice, are the main concern of Neoplasmatic-Design. Similarly Protocell-Architecture’s main concern is the potentials of Protocell which is an output of advances in synthetic biology, chemistry and physics, unlike genetics. Neoplasm and Protocell, are two notions which are created as a result of scientific and technological advances in some disciplinaries that differ from the architecture. These notions are transferred by some architects to their own discipline and used as the tools for generating architectural discourses. These notions are used both metaphorically and in real sense for these mentioned discourses. Those are used as a metaphor for putting forward new ways of thinking in architecture. In real sense, those are new materials which emerge as new tools and processes in architectural practice. Architects who construct their discourses with the notions of Neoplasm and Protocell, aim to propose new worlds with the aid of mentioned materials, tools and processes and they try to have visions for the possible futures of architecture. Just like Genetic-Architectures, the architectural design products which belong to Neoplasmatic-Design and Protocell-Architecture, are process-oriented instead of being form-oriented. Considering the existing architectural discourses, including Genetic-Architectures in general, it is difficult to mention about a chronologically one-way thought process. Together with the intellectual linear progress in time, flashbacks, bidirectional progress, forward and backward leaps and breaking points can also be realized. This situation reveals the complex structure of architectural knowledge. Also today’s pluralistic environment does undeniably have the impact on this situation. In this environment in which everything changes and is consumed rapidly, it is not easy to resolve the complexity of architectural knowledge. In order to show the complexity of architectural knowledge and to create an example for this issue in a narrowed frame, a systematic comparision of two interrelated architectural discourses are made within the scope of the thesis. Neoplasmatic-Design and Protocell-Architecture are comparatively examined in the research study. According to these comparisions, it is aimed to put forth the similarities and diversities between the two discourses and to present  the effects, potentials and the risks of these. In a confined space, this study is carried out for representing the complex situation at the intersection of architecture, science and technology. First to make this mentioned comparative examination, it is tried to create a historical background for Neoplasmatic-Design and Protocell-Architecture. Accordingly, in the second part of the study, advances which are outside and inside the disciplinary of architecture and are effective in the formation of the two discourses, mentioned briefly in chronological order. At the end of this chapter, the formation models and objectives of Neoplasmatic-Design and Protocell-Architecture are described. For the comparision of Neoplasmatic-Design and Protocell-Architecture which is the main focus of the thesis, the bottom-up approach is used as a method in the study. Accordingly, in the third part of the thesis, two discourses are compared as divided in sub-categories. These sub-categories are people as important figures for the discourses, notions which are used in the discourses, architectural design products which supports the discourses and are grouped according to different scales and finally methods for design, representation and manifacture of these products. In the chapter of results and evaluations of the study, with the outputs of the comparisions, the effects, the potentials and the risks of these two discourses are discussed. Throughout the thesis, it is not intended to answer the question, whether these discourses really exist in the future, or not. Instead of that, at the end of the thesis, the differences and the similarities between these two discourses are reintepreted with a general approach, so that the architecture’s present complex situation which is originated from scientific and technological advances, is partially photographed as it is intended mainly in the study.
