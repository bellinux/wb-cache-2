5|$|Prior {{to making}} {{landfall}} near the El SalvadorGuatemala border as a tropical depression, the precursor disturbance dropped heavy rainfall over Nicaragua, which later spread into <b>El</b> <b>Salvador</b> <b>and</b> Guatemala. Many rivers {{in the region}} burst their banks after five days of rainfall, causing severe flooding and multiple mudslides. Throughout Central America, at least 1,432people were killed, {{with most of the}} fatalities occurring in <b>El</b> <b>Salvador</b> <b>and</b> Guatemala. Another 225deaths were attributed to floods from the depression in southern Mexico. In addition, Paul was responsible for moderate damage and 24fatalities in northwestern Mexico, where it made landfall at hurricane strength.|$|E

Four {{people died in}} various incidents related to the system: three in <b>El</b> <b>Salvador</b> <b>and</b> one in Honduras. Initially expecting a landfalling storm, officials in Northwestern Mexico prepared equipment for power outages, closed schools, and evacuated 180residents. Sandra's effects largely consisted of light to moderate rainfall; some traffic accidents and landslides resulted from this, though the overall impacts were limited.|$|E

5|$|In 1529, El Salvador became {{embroiled in}} a {{jurisdictional}} dispute with neighbouring Nicaragua. Pedrarias Dávila sent Martín de Estete {{at the head of}} an expedition to annex the territory to Nicaragua. Estete captured the leader of a rival Spanish expedition in eastern <b>El</b> <b>Salvador,</b> <b>and</b> marched on San Salvador, before being repulsed by a relief force sent from Guatemala. In 1530, Pedro de Alvarado ordered the establishment of a new settlement at San Miguel, in the east of the country, to protect against further incursions from Nicaragua, and to assist in the conquest of the surrounding area. Indigenous uprisings against the invaders continued, spreading from neighbouring Honduras. The general uprising across the two provinces was put down by the end of 1538, and by 1539 the province was considered pacified. The conquistadores discovered that there was little gold or silver to be found in <b>El</b> <b>Salvador,</b> <b>and</b> it became a colonial backwater with a small Spanish population, within the jurisdiction of the Captaincy General of Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|The convict cichlid {{displays}} significant color {{across its}} range. Some of these regional variants are now considered different species. In the cichlid-keeping hobby, Rusty Wessel collected one such fish, the Honduran Red Point Cichlid (Amatitlania sp.) from a stream in Honduras. The Honduran Red Point Convict ranges from Atlantic Honduras south to Costa Rica. Other new species formerly included in A. nigrofasciata are Amatitlania coatepeque, from Lake Coatepeque in <b>El</b> <b>Salvador,</b> <b>and</b> Amatitlania kanna, from Panama's Atlantic coast.|$|E
5|$|A red alert {{was also}} issued in <b>El</b> <b>Salvador,</b> <b>and</b> 3,000people were evacuated; eight people {{drowned in the}} country. The Río Negro in Nicaragua washed away a bridge, and two bridges were {{destroyed}} along the Pan-American Highway. A state of emergency was issued in the country. Damage was estimated at $10million (96million pesos), and there were 11deaths. Further south in Costa Rica, the floods damaged 31bridges and caused 1,600people to evacuate. Across Central America, the rainfall caused about $40million (385million pesos) in crop damage.|$|E

5|$|Although Panama and Costa Rica {{were not}} in the direct path of Hurricane Beta, storm {{warnings}} were issued for the two countries on October27 as heavy rains, up to 20in (508mm), from the outer bands of Beta were possible. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Panama alerted officials in Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, <b>El</b> <b>Salvador</b> <b>and</b> Guatemala about the possible impacts from Beta. Civil defence officials in El Salvador declared a pre-emptive alert due to the possibility of rain-triggered mudslides from the outer bands of Beta.|$|E
5|$|Gregorio Bundio and his {{assistant}} José Santacolomba coached the team in the qualifying stages for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. This {{was the first time}} El Salvador participated in World Cup qualifying. As host, Mexico automatically qualified so there was just one qualification spot up for grabs. El Salvador won group 3, playing four games, winning three and losing one. Their record was 10 goals for and 5 goals against with 6 points. As a result, they qualified for a 3-game playoff against group 2 winner and traditional rival, Honduras. The first game, hosted on 8 June 1969 in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, was won 1–0 by the home team and was followed by crowd violence. The second game, hosted on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of San Salvador, was won 3–0 by <b>El</b> <b>Salvador,</b> <b>and</b> was followed by even greater violence. A play-off match took place in Mexico City on 26 June 1969. El Salvador won 3–2 after extra time. As a result of existing tensions being exacerbated by these matches, on 14 July 1969 the two countries began the 100-hour-long war known as the Football War. As a result of the conflict, <b>El</b> <b>Salvador</b> <b>and</b> Honduras were both disqualified from entering the 1969 CONCACAF Championship qualification.|$|E

Guatemala was placed under a warning on October 24. In addition, new flash flood and mudslide warnings were raised for Guatemala and the Mexican state of Chiapas on October 24 and 25, respectively.

5|$|Four pilosity {{patterns}} (patterns of hair-like setae) {{are known}} to occur within Tatuidris collections. Pilosity pattern A consists of a mix of both long flexuous and short appressed setae. This {{is the most common}} pilosity pattern and the one that most resembles the type specimens from <b>El</b> <b>Salvador</b> <b>and</b> the gyne from Otongachi, Ecuador. Pilosity pattern B is characterized by very short, fully appressed, and regular spaced setae arrayed homogeneously and equidistantly on the head, mesosoma, petiole, postpetiole and gaster. Pilosity pattern C is characterized by dense lanose-looking setae. Pilosity pattern D consists of short and uniform decumbent (strongly inclined but not fully appressed) setae scattered throughout the body.|$|E
5|$|The Maya civilization was a Mesoamerican civilization {{developed}} by the Maya peoples, and noted for its hieroglyphic script—the only known fully developed writing system of the pre-Columbian Americas—as well as for its art, architecture, mathematics, calendar, and astronomical system. The Maya civilization developed {{in an area that}} encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador. This region consists of the northern lowlands encompassing the Yucatán Peninsula, and the highlands of the Sierra Madre, running from the Mexican state of Chiapas, across southern Guatemala and onwards into <b>El</b> <b>Salvador,</b> <b>and</b> the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{hurricane}} were from a tropical wave that exited the coast of Africa on June3. Around four days later the system entered the Caribbean Sea, passing over the San Andres islands on June12. The area of convection, or thunderstorms, spread across Central America. A surface circulation developed offshore <b>El</b> <b>Salvador,</b> <b>and</b> the system formed into a tropical depression on June 14. For much of the summer of 1971, a large pool of anomalously warm water temperatures extended from Central America to the Gulf of California off the Mexican coast, reaching 89.6 °F (32 °C). This allowed for steady intensification as it tracked through the Gulf of Tehuantepec.|$|E
