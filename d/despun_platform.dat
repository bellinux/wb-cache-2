Rotating at a speed of 60 rpm, the application envisaged for the MSM was as a despin bearing for the <b>despun</b> <b>platform</b> or despun antenna of a spin stabilized satellite. The MSM was built and tested to qualification level and is currently undergoing real time life testing...|$|E
40|$|The Inner Magnetosphere Imager (IMI) {{mission will}} carry {{instruments}} to globally image energetic neutral atoms, far and extreme ultraviolet light, and X rays. These imagers {{will see the}} ring current inner plasmasheet, plasmasphere, aurora, and geocorona. With these observations it will be possible, for the first time, to {{develop an understanding of}} the global shape of the inner magnetosphere and the interrelationships between its parts. Seven instruments are currently envisioned on a single spinning spacecraft with a <b>despun</b> <b>platform.</b> IMI will be launched into an elliptical, polar orbit with an apogee of approximately 7 Earth radii altitude and perigee of 4800 km altitude...|$|E
40|$|The {{change from}} an {{intermediate}} mission (cost ceiling of $ 300 million) to a solar-terrestrial probe class mission (cost ceiling of $ 150 million) will require some {{major changes in}} the configuration of the IMI mission. One option being considered is to move to a small spin-stabilized spacecraft (with no <b>despun</b> <b>platform)</b> which could be launched with a smaller Taurus or Conestoga class booster. Such a change in spacecraft type would not present any fundamental problems (other than restrictions on mass and power) for the He plus 304 A plasmasphere imager, the high and low energy neutral atom imagers, and the geocoronal imager, but would present a challenge for the FUV auroral imager since the original plan called for this instrument to operate from a <b>despun</b> <b>platform.</b> Since the FUV instrument is part of the core payload it cannot be dropped from the instrument complement without jeopardizing the science goals of the mission. A way must be found to keep this instrument and to allow it to accomplish most, if not all, of its science objectives. One of the subjects discussed are options for building an FUV instrument for a spinning spacecraft. Since a number of spinning spacecraft have carried auroral imagers, a range of techniques exists. In addition, the option of flying the FUV imager on a separate micro-satellite launched with the main IMI spacecraft or with a separate pegasus launch, was considered and is discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{batch mode}} process which {{identifies}} three reference stars within a rotor-mounted star scanner's field-of-view {{based on the}} criteria of intensity and geometry was established. The sequential mode which continuously tracks the reference stars provides star transit times and estimates of rotor's spin rate. A least-square estimator was formulated which sequentially determines the spacecraft attitude from sucessive star crossings by minimizing the error in the star and scanner slit normal orthogonality. This spacecraft attitude also provides intermittent updates for the gyro propagated inertial attitude of the <b>despun</b> science <b>platform.</b> Simulation results are presented, showing successful star identification and attitude convergence {{in the presence of}} nutation and star transit time uncertainty...|$|R

The camera has an 8 -degree total field of view, an angular resolution of 0. 036 degrees, and auroral images will be obtained with a time resolution of 37 seconds.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{polar orbit}} {{exploration of the}} sun and solar-related phenomena in the heliosphere through the International Solar Polar Mission (ISPM) is discussed. The characteristics of the out-of-the-ecliptic mission are mentioned and a detailed list of the scientific objectives is given: properties of the solar corona, the solar wind, the structure of the sun-wind interface, the heliospheric magnetic field, solar and non-solar cosmic rays, solar radio bursts and plasma waves, and the interstellar/interplanetary neutral gas and dust. Measurements of the Jovian magnetosphere during the Jupiter flyby phase and interplanetary physics investigations during the initial earth-Jupiter phase are pointed out as secondary objectives. The Nasa spacecraft with a sun-pointing <b>despun</b> <b>platform</b> on which the White Light Coronagraph/X-Ray and Extreme Ultraviolet Telescope (CXX), and the Mass Separating Ion Instrument are mounted, is detailed. The operational configuration of EASA, a spin stabilized spacecraft, is given and characteristics of special features such as the large paraboloidal high gain antenna, the radio-isotope thermoelectric generator, the radial boom and the central equipment compartment are described and shown in a diagram. The mission design and launch parameters block diagrams are given...|$|E
40|$|Imaging the Earth's {{magnetosphere}} {{from space}} will enable scientists {{to better understand}} the global shape of the inner magnetosphere, its components and processes. The proposed Inner Magnetosphere Imager (IMI) mission will obtain the first simultaneous images of the component regions of the inner magnetosphere and will enable scientists to relate these global images to internal and external influences as well as local observations. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is performing a concept definition study of the proposed mission. As currently envisioned, the baseline mission calls for an instrument complement of approximately seven imagers to be flown in an elliptical Earth orbit with an apogee of seven Earth Radii (RE). Several spacecraft concepts have been examined for the mission. The baseline concept utilizes a spinning spacecraft with a <b>despun</b> <b>platform,</b> the second uses a three-axis stabilized spacecraft with a spinning platform, while the third option splits the instruments onto two small satellites; a spinning spacecraft and a complementary three-axis stabilized spacecraft. This paper will address the mission objectives, the rationale for using proven spacecraft designs, and the preliminary concept definition study team results for all three options...|$|E

40|$|The Global Geospace Science (GGS) Polar Plasma Laboratory (POLAR) {{spacecraft}} {{was launched}} on February 24, 1996, by a Delta 2. The spacecraft, a major axis spinner, appeared to function nominally throughout the early mission phase, which included several deployments, and orbit and attitude maneuvers. Of particular {{interest is the}} fact that the spacecraft was launched with a deliberate dynamic imbalance. During a segment of early orbit operations, a pair of Lanyard Deployed Booms (LDB) were extended. These booms were not identical; the intent was that the spacecraft would be nearly dynamically balanced after they were deployed. The spacecraft contained two dynamic balance mechanisms intended to fine tune the balance on orbit. However, subsequent images taken by the science instruments on the <b>Despun</b> <b>Platform</b> during the dynamic balancing segment indicated an offset of the principal spin axis from the geometric axis. This offset produced a sinusoidal blurring of the science images sufficiently large to degrade science data below mission requirement specifications. In the end, the imbalance encountered in flight was significantly outside the correction capability of the balances. The purpose of this paper is to examine the flight data during the various deployment and maneuver stages of the early orbit operations coupled with analytical simulations to discuss some of the potential causes of the resultant imbalance...|$|E
40|$|The Visible Imaging System (VIS) on Polar {{spacecraft}} of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center {{was launched}} into orbit about Earth on February 24, 1996. Since shortly after launch, the Earth Camera subsystem of the VIS has been operated nearly continuously to acquire far ultraviolet, global images of Earth and its {{northern and southern}} auroral ovals. The only exceptions to this continuous imaging occurred for approximately 10 days at the times of the Polar spacecraft re-orientation maneuvers in October, 1996 and April, 1997. Since launch, approximately 525, 000 images have been acquired with the VIS Earth Camera. The VIS instrument operational health continues to be excellent. Since launch, all systems have operated nominally with all voltages, currents, and temperatures remaining at nominal values. In addition, {{the sensitivity of the}} Earth Camera to ultraviolet light has remained constant throughout the operation period. Revised flight software was uploaded to the VIS in order to compensate for the spacecraft wobble. This is accomplished by electronic shuttering of the sensor in synchronization with the 6 -second period of the wobble, thus recovering the original spatial resolution obtainable with the VIS Earth Camera. In addition, software patches were uploaded to make the VIS immune to signal dropouts that occur in the sliprings of the <b>despun</b> <b>platform</b> mechanism. These changes have worked very well. The VIS and in particular the VIS Earth Camera is fully operational and will continue to acquire global auroral images as the sun progresses toward solar maximum conditions {{after the turn of the}} century...|$|E
40|$|The aurorae are {{the result}} of {{collisions}} with the atmosphere of energetic particles that have their origin in the solar wind, and reach the atmosphere after having undergone varying degrees of acceleration and redistribution within the Earth's magnetosphere. The global scale phenomenon represented by the aurorae therefore contains considerable information concerning the solar-terrestrial connection. For example, by correctly measuring specific auroral emissions, and with the aid of comprehensive models of the region, we can infer the total energy flux entering the atmosphere and the average energy of the particles causing these emissions. Furthermore, from these auroral emissions we can determine the ionospheric conductances {{that are part of the}} closing of the magnetospheric currents through the ionosphere, and from these we can in turn obtain the electric potentials and convective patterns that are an essential element to our understanding of the global magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere-mesosphere. Simultaneously acquired images of the auroral oval and polar cap not only yield the temporal and spatial morphology from which we can infer activity indices, but in conjunction with simultaneous measurements made on spacecraft at other locations within the magnetosphere, allow us to map the various parts of the oval back to their source regions in the magnetosphere. This paper describes the Ultraviolet Imager for the Global Geospace Sciences portion of the International Solar-Terrestrial Physics program. The instrument operates in the far ultraviolet (FUV) and is capable of imaging the auroral oval regardless of whether it is sunlit or in darkness. The instrument has an 8 ° circular field of view and is located on a <b>despun</b> <b>platform</b> which permits simultaneous imaging of the entire oval for at least 9 hours of every 18 hour orbit. The three mirror, unobscured aperture, optical system (f / 2. 9) provides excellent imaging over this full field of view, yielding a per pixel angular resolution of 0. 6 milliradians. Its FUV filters have been designed to allow accurate spectral separation of the features of interest, thus allowing quantitative interpretation of the images to provide the parameters mentioned above. The system has been designed to provide ten orders of magnitude blocking against longer wavelength (primarily visible) scattered sunlight, thus allowing the first imaging of key, spectrally resolved, FUV diagnostic features in the fully sunlit midday aurorae. The intensified-CCD detector has a nominal frame rate of 37 s, and the fast optical system has a noise equivalent signal within one frame of ∼ 10 R. The instantaneous dynamic range is > 1000 and can be positioned within an overall gain range of 10 4, allowing measurement of both the very weak polar cap emissions and the very bright aurora. The optical surfaces have been designed to be sufficiently smooth to permit this dynamic range to be utilized without the scattering of light from bright features into the weaker features. Finally, the data product can only be as good as the degree to which the instrument performance is characterized and calibrated. In the VUV, calibration of an an imager intended for quantitative studies is a task requiring some pioneering methods, but it is now possible to calibrate such an instrument over its focal plane to an accuracy of ± 10 %. In summary, very recent advances in optical, filter and detector technology have been exploited to produce an auroral imager to meet the ISTP objectives...|$|E
