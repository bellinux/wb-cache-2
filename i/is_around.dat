5|$|The {{resonator}} {{shown in}} figure 12 <b>is</b> <b>around</b> 120 μm in length. Experimental complete filters with an operating frequency of 30GHz have been produced using cantilever varactors as the resonator elements. The size of this filter <b>is</b> <b>around</b> 4×3.5mm.

5|$|Around {{one-third of}} people with {{psoriasis}} report {{a family history of}} the disease, and researchers have identified genetic loci associated with the condition. Identical twin studies suggest a 70% chance of a twin developing psoriasis if the other twin has the disorder. The risk <b>is</b> <b>around</b> 20% for nonidentical twins. These findings suggest both a genetic susceptibility and an environmental response in developing psoriasis.|$|E

Height and activity both peak when the volcano <b>is</b> <b>around</b> 500,000 years old and then rapidly decline. Eventually it goes dormant, and eventually extinct. Erosion then weathers the volcano until it again becomes a seamount.|$|E
