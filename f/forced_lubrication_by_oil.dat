50|$|Engine braking in a premix {{two-stroke}} engine {{can be extremely}} harmful to the engine, because cylinder and piston lubricant is delivered to each cylinder mixed with fuel. Consequently, during engine braking, the engine starves not only of fuel but also lubricant, causing accelerated wear. Many old two-stroke cars (Saab, Wartburg, etc.) had a freewheel device on the transmission to make engine braking optional. Most two-stroke motorcycle engines since the 1970s have had <b>lubrication</b> <b>by</b> an <b>oil</b> pump, independent of the throttle and fuel system, such as Suzuki's Posi-Force system.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame is}} a full steel duplex {{swingarm}} design, with Ceriani rear suspension, and Marzocchi front forks. The early models had a twin leading shoe drum brake up front (Strada: 200 mm drum, Sport: 230 mm drum) that was notoriously grabby on the Borrani spoked wheels, but these were replaced with a single chromed 260 mm Grimeca disc in 1976, and later optional double discs. The rear drum brake was replaced in the early 1980s with a Grimeca disc. Switchgear, tail and brake lights were the standard CEV model used on many Italian motorcycles of the 1970s. The month and year of manufacture is embossed in small figures {{on the side of}} each cast wheel, near where one of the seven cast spokes meets the rim. The helical gear transmission was a six-speed, with a top gear ratio of 1:0.954, making it akin to an overdrive. The transmission was engaged with a six-plate dry clutch, making a characteristic rattle similar to Ducatis when disengaged. Secondary drive was by a 5/8 x 3/8-inch chain to a rear sprocket with cush drive. Gear change is by right foot and the rear brake operated by left foot. Engine <b>lubrication</b> was <b>by</b> <b>oil</b> pump to the crankshaft but no <b>force</b> <b>lubrication</b> went to the rocker gear. Instead, crankcase pressure forced oil mist up the short pushrod tunnels to the rocker covers, where two 'crow's feet' allowed mist to condense and drip onto the rocker gear. Although ingenious, it required riders to gentle warm up their engines before using maximum revs, redlined at 9,200 rpm. <b>Oil</b> filtration was <b>by</b> plastic mesh filter.|$|R

Jet lubricated ball bearings were limited to speeds less than 2, 500, 000 DN. Bearings having inner-race land riding cages produced lower temperatures than bearings with outer-race land riding cages. For a given lubricant flow rate dual orifice jets produced lower bearing temperatures than single orifice jets. However, under-race lubrication produced under all conditions of operation lower bearing temperatures with no apparent bearing speed limitation...|$|R

40|$|We {{formulate}} a nonlinear partial differential sedimentation equation to describe spatiotemporal changes in concentration for sedimenting particles at low Reynolds number. It {{is based on}} two fluid-mediated forces. One is the viscous interaction of a particle with the surrounding suspension, which causes the settling speed to decrease with increasing volume fraction according to an empirical hindered settling function; we constrain its form by a comprehensive data compilation. The other ingredient is a nonlocal <b>lubrication</b> <b>force</b> set <b>by</b> the spatial gradient in the time derivative of volume fraction.

50|$|Early screw-propelled steamships used a {{thrust block}} or thrust box {{composed}} of perhaps a dozen lower-rated plain thrust journal bearings stacked {{on the same}} shaft. These were problematic in service: they were bulky, difficult to dismantle, wasted power through friction {{and they had a}} tendency to overheat. The thrust box was built of a box-like cast iron housing with a radial bearing at each end and a number of collars formed on the shaft between them. This shaft was often a short section of removable shaft called the thrust shaft, linking the engine ahead to the propeller shaft astern. A series of iron horseshoe-shaped collars fitted over the small diameter of the shaft and bore against the forward face of the shaft's collars. Each horseshoe was faced with a low-friction pad of babbitt metal. <b>Lubrication</b> was <b>by</b> an <b>oil</b> bath in the box and a plentiful volume was important for cooling purposes too.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{methodology}} for the dynamical analysis of mechanical systems considering realistic joint characteristics, namely, joints with clearance and lubrication is presented. For {{the case of}} the joints with clearance modelled as a contact pair with dry contact, a technique using a continuous approach for the evaluation of the contact force is applied, in which the energy dissipation in form of hysteresis damping is considered. The friction forces are calculated using a modified Coulomb’s friction law. For the lubricated case, the hydrodynamic theory for dynamically loaded journal–bearings is used to compute the <b>forces</b> generated <b>by</b> <b>lubrication</b> action. The numerical results point out that the existence of dry joint clearances causes high peaks on the kinematic and dynamic system’s characteristics due to contact–impact forces when compared to those obtained with lubricated model. The performance of the lubricated joint is closer to that of an ideal joint. FEDER - Project POCTI/ 2001 /EME/ 38281 Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|R

40|$|Discretized fluid solvers {{coupled to}} a Newtonian {{dynamics}} method are a popular tool to study suspension flow. As any simulation technique with finite resolution, the lattice Boltzmann method, when coupled to discrete particles using the momentum exchange method, resolves the diverging lubrication interactions between surfaces near contact only insufficiently. For spheres, {{it is common}} practice to account for surface-normal <b>lubrication</b> <b>forces</b> <b>by</b> means of an explicit correction term. A method that additionally covers all further singular interactions for spheres {{is present in the}} literature as well as a link-based approach that allows for more general shapes but does not capture non-normal interactions correctly. In this paper, lattice-independent lubrication corrections for aspherical particles are outlined, taking into account all leading divergent interaction terms. An efficient implementation for arbitrary spheroids is presented and compared to purely normal and link-based models. Good consistency with Stokesian dynamics simulations of spheres is found. The non-normal interactions affect the viscosity of suspensions of spheres at volume fractions Φ >= 0. 3 but already at Φ >= 0. 2 for spheroids. Regarding shear-induced diffusion of spheres, a distinct effect is found at 0. 1 <= Φ <= 0. 5 and even increasing the resolution of the radius to 8 lattice units is no substitute for an accurate modeling of non-normal interactions.

With this aim in mind, waste engine oil is collected in a tank, and it is purified from contaminants such as dust, heavy carbon soot, metal particles, gum-type materials and other impurities by filtering in the process prepared earlier. To investigate effects of additives known as sodium carbonate (NaCO 3), zeolite and lime (CaO) on density, viscosity, flash point, sulfur content, heating value and distillation temperature, the purified oil samples are blended separately with additives having mass basis of 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 % and 10 %. The mixed samples are exposed to pyrolitic distillation process to produce fuels to be used in engines. Thermal and physical properties of the produced fuels such as density, flash point, viscosity, sulfur content, heating value and distillation temperatures are examined. From these results, the CaO with a ratio of 2 % has the highest effect on decreasing of sulfur content of the waste engine oil and on acquiring the most suitable distillation temperatures close to values of a diesel fuel.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to model and analyze flexible spatial multibody systems with clearance cylindrical joints is presented throughout this work. The flexible parts are modeled by using the absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) based elements, while the rigid parts are described by employing the natural coordinate formulation (NCF), {{which can lead to}} a constant system mass matrix for the final derived system equations of motion. In a simple way, a cylindrical joint with clearance is composed by two main elements, that is, a journal inside a bearing. Additionally, a lubricant fluid can exist between these two mechanical elements to reduce the friction, wear and increase the system’s life. For the case in which the cylindrical joint with clearance is modeled as a dry contact pair, a technique using a continuous approach for the evaluation of the contact force is applied, where the energy dissipation in form of hysteresis damping is considered. Furthermore, the frictional forces developed in those contacts are evaluated using a modified Coulomb’s friction law. For the lubricated case, the hydrodynamic theory for dynamically loaded journal-bearings is used to compute the <b>forces</b> generated <b>by</b> <b>lubrication</b> actions. The lubricated model is based on the Reynolds’ equation developed for the case of journal-bearings in which the length-to-diameter ratios are up to 1. With this approach, the misalignment of the journal inside the bearing can be studied. Finally, two demonstrative examples of application are used to provide the results that support the discussion and show the validity of the proposed methodologies.
