5|$|Chiswick <b>High</b> <b>Road</b> {{contains}} {{a mix of}} retail, restaurants, food outlets and expanding office and hotel space. The wide streets encourage cafes, pubs and restaurants to provide pavement seating. Lying between the offices at the Golden Mile Great West Road and Hammersmith, office developments and warehouse conversions to offices began from the 1960s. The first in 1961 was 414 Chiswick <b>High</b> <b>Road</b> {{on the site of}} the old Empire Cinema. Between 1964 and 1966, the 18-storey IBM headquarters was built above Gunnersbury station, designed to accommodate 1500 people. It became the home of the British Standards Institution in 1994.|$|E

5|$|The new {{station was}} {{constructed}} in an Art Deco/Streamline Moderne design by Charles Holden with L H Bucknell. Like Holden's other designs for London Underground in the 1930s, East Finchley station was inspired by European architecture (particularly Dutch) that Holden had seen on trips to the continent during that decade. The track here runs roughly north-west to south-east. The imposing station building, built on rising ground adjacent to the railway bridge over <b>High</b> <b>Road</b> (A1000), has three entrances. The two main entrances to the ticket hall are {{on the north side}} of the tracks facing <b>High</b> <b>Road</b> and the third, minor entrance, is on the south side. The entrances are linked by a passage under the tracks which provides access up to the platforms.|$|E

5|$|Charles himself took a main column {{along the}} <b>high</b> <b>road,</b> a {{causeway}} that passed by Saulgau, to attack Lefebvre on points between Hoßkirch and Ostrach.

5|$|Chiswick had two {{well-known}} theatres in the 20th century. The Chiswick Empire (1912 to 1959) was at 414 Chiswick <b>High</b> <b>Road.</b> It had 2,140 seats, and staged {{music hall}} entertainment, plays, reviews, opera, ballet {{and an annual}} Christmas pantomime. The Q Theatre (1924 to 1959) was a small theatre opposite Kew Bridge station. It staged the first works of Terence Rattigan and William Douglas-Home, {{and many of its}} plays went on to the West End.|$|E

5|$|Leigh is crossed by the Bolton to St Helens Road <b>high</b> <b>road,</b> an old {{packhorse}} {{route that}} became a Turnpike Trust in 1762. The A579 road bypasses the town centre using {{the line of the}} Bolton and Leigh Railway. The Bridgewater Canal and the Leigh Branch of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal cross the town west to east, the canals meeting at Leigh Bridge just south of the town centre.|$|E
5|$|Terraces {{of shops}} were {{built around the}} fringes of the estate, both to cater for the {{residents}} of Noel Park and for residents of the expanding suburb of Wood Green and the users of the adjacent railway station. The designs of the terraces varied, from short terraces of small shops on the edges of the less-visited eastern portions of the estate, to parades of large shops on Wood Green <b>High</b> <b>Road</b> near the railway station.|$|E
5|$|The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), {{successor}} to the GNR, was compelled by the Ministry of Transport to waive the veto or proceed with its own electrification. In November 1925, the LNER abandoned its electrification scheme. In 1929 the incoming Second Labour Government initiated a policy of direct subsidy for major infrastructure projects, and in 1930 the Underground Electric Railways Company of London began work on extending the GNP, now the Piccadilly line. The Piccadilly line extension to Cockfosters opened in stages, with stations at Wood Green and Turnpike Lane – both on {{the western edge of}} Noel Park, at the junctions of Wood Green <b>High</b> <b>Road</b> and Lordship Lane, and Wood Green <b>High</b> <b>Road</b> and Westbury Avenue, respectively – opening on 19 September 1932. With the area now connected to west and central London by clean, rapid and frequent electric trains, the population of the surrounding areas began to rise rapidly.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} village {{school was}} built on Ickenham <b>High</b> <b>Road</b> in 1866, although by 1920 it had become overcrowded. Older children were moved to the village hall in 1928 under the name Ickenham Temporary Council School. In 1929 the village school closed and its infant pupils also moved to the village hall. The road was widened in 1934 necessitating demolition of the school building along with the original Fox & Geese public house.|$|E
5|$|By this point, the Noel Park {{development}} and the growing nearby community of Wood Green were coming to dominate the area. In recognition of this, in 1902 Green Lanes railway station was renamed Noel Park & Wood Green. In 1911 a group of mid-Victorian houses on Wood Green <b>High</b> <b>Road,</b> immediately south of the railway station, were demolished by the Artizans Company {{to make way for}} the Cheapside shopping parade, built to serve residents of Noel Park and the growing community of Wood Green.|$|E
5|$|Chiswick's Roman Catholic church, Our Lady of Grace and St Edward (the Confessor) in the Diocese of Westminster, lies on {{the corner}} of Dukes Avenue and the <b>High</b> <b>Road.</b> It is a red brick building; the parish was founded in 1848, a school began c. 1855, and a church was opened by Cardinal Wiseman on the present site in 1864. It was {{replaced}} by the present building in 1886, opened by Cardinal Manning. The heavy debts incurred were paid off and the church consecrated in 1904. The square tower was added after the First World War by Canon Egan as a war memorial.|$|E

5|$|The {{water quality}} of the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} is generally poor due to high temperatures, sedimentation, and oxygen saturation levels which occur throughout the region. Most of these problems are created by human activity; forests and riparian zones have been cleared {{to make way for}} agriculture, and <b>high</b> <b>road</b> densities cause slope failures. Hydraulic mining near Sterlingville devastated the surrounding landscape, leaving the slopes bare and sending rocks and gravel downstream. Cattle and sheep were introduced to the area in the late 19th century; they have since overgrazed some areas of the watershed, reducing native grasses and allowing noxious weeds to spread. Overgrazing also contributes to soil erosion. Large amounts of water is diverted from the river and its tributaries, sometimes {{to such an extent that}} the mouth is left nearly dry.|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, new {{soap operas}} have {{continued}} to be developed. Daytime drama Doctors began in March 2000, preceding Neighbours on BBC One. In 2002, as ratings for the Scottish serial <b>High</b> <b>Road</b> (formerly Take The <b>High</b> <b>Road)</b> continued to decline, BBC Scotland launched River City, which proved popular and effectively replaced <b>High</b> <b>Road</b> when it was cancelled in 2003. The long-running serial Brookside ended in November 2003 after 21 years on the air, leaving Hollyoaks as Channel 4's flagship serial.|$|E
25|$|The 1st Brigade (Steinmetz's), {{which had}} been placed in reserve, was ordered to take post, in Squares, upon the <b>high</b> <b>road</b> to Sombreffe, to check the {{pressure}} from the French Cavalry. Subsequently, when the direction of the retreat was decided upon, it fell back upon Tilly. The 4th Brigade (Donnersmarck's), {{with the exception of one}} or two battalions, advanced again through Sombreffe towards Ligny, just as the French cavalry pushed towards the <b>high</b> <b>road.</b> The battalions of the Brigade formed squares, and fell back upon the <b>high</b> <b>road,</b> whence they continued their further retreat.|$|E
