25|$|The flat Earth {{model is}} an archaic {{conception}} of Earth's shape as a plane or disk. Many ancient cultures subscribed to a flat Earth cosmography, including Greece until the classical period, the Bronze Age and Iron Age civilizations of the Near East until the Hellenistic period, India until the Gupta period (early centuries AD), and China until the 17th century. That paradigm was also typically {{held in the}} aboriginal cultures of the Americas, {{and the notion of}} a flat Earth domed by the firmament in the shape of an <b>inverted</b> <b>bowl</b> was common in pre-scientific societies.|$|E
25|$|Pottery making can {{be found}} {{in many parts of the}} state, but the two best-known centers are San Bartolo Coyotepec and Santa Maria Atzompa. Most of Oaxaca’s pottery is made without potters’ wheels, instead done with the use of molds or formed by hand, {{sometimes}} using a kind of “proto-wheel”, which is a plate or shallow bowl place over an <b>inverted</b> <b>bowl.</b> Ceramics are one of Oaxaca’s best known handcrafts in Mexico. The most common glazed pieces include those with base colors of brown and white, shaped into vases, plates, cups and decorative pieces. For utilitarian pieces, molds are most commonly used. For very large pieces such as cantaros other storage containers, the molding is done in sections.|$|E
500|$|Members of Eucteniza {{reach up}} to [...] in body length (not {{including}} the legs), which is relatively large to very large among spiders. [...] The cephalothorax (the anterior body segment bearing the eyes, mouthparts, and legs) is oval, slightly longer than wide, and slopes considerably towards the rear {{when viewed from}} the side. The rear third of the carapace (the upper surface of the cephalothorax) is relatively soft, and is distinctly lighter in coloration. The carapace is often devoid of hairs, and in some species fringed with black bristles. The eight eyes are not elevated and are arranged in two rows in a rectangular area: the hind row is recurved, or slightly curved upwards (as in a bowl or shallow U), while the anterior row is slightly procurved (slightly curved downwards, as in an <b>inverted</b> <b>bowl).</b> Eucteniza spiders are colored in various shades of brown, with males generally appearing a dark reddish brown. The jaws (chelicerae) are dark brown. The abdomen sometimes has a dark brown blotch on the upper surface. Measurements of most species only refer to the cephalothorax, which is less variable than the abdomen: recorded cephalothorax lengths range from [...] in E. huasteca to [...] in E. relata.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} more than 95 percent of the Venus surface reveals 145 steep-sided domes which can be {{subdivided}} into a variety of morphologic forms, the most common being shaped like <b>inverted</b> <b>bowls</b> or flat-topped domes. Results of a preliminary analysis of the distribution and geologic setting of the domes are presented. The relation of the domes to analogous terrestrial features is examined, and possible models for their mode of emplacement are outlined...|$|R
50|$|One popularly {{circulated}} picture, {{thought to}} date from 2500 B.C. {{from the walls}} of a burial chamber in Beni Hasan, Egypt, shows two men kneeling over four <b>inverted</b> <b>bowls.</b> It was taken by early Egyptologists Wilkinson and Newberry as evidence that the cups and balls effect, or its related deceptive gambling game, thimblerig, possibly dates back to Ancient Egypt. Because of its context, modern Egyptologists regard the image as a game using pots or cups but details of the game are unknown. The illustration is unique in ancient Egyptian art, so whether or not the game utilizes sleight of hand trickery may never be known unless a future discovery produces a similar image in a more explanatory context.|$|R
50|$|A {{cocktail}} {{glass is}} a stemmed glass with an <b>inverted</b> cone <b>bowl.</b> Though {{they are often}} referred to as martini glasses, they differ from martini glasses in that they have smaller, narrower bowls with rounded or flat bottoms, while martini glasses generally have larger, wider bowls which are fully conical at the bottom.|$|R
2500|$|The {{world of}} the Ascension is a three-part {{universe}} with the heavens above, a flat earth centered on Jerusalem in the middle, and the underworld below. Heaven was separated from the earth by the firmament, the visible sky, a solid <b>inverted</b> <b>bowl</b> where God's throne sat [...] "on the vaulted roof of earth."(Isaiah 40:22). Humans looking up from earth saw the floor of heaven, made of clear blue lapis-lazuli (Exodus 24:9-10), as was God's throne (Ezekiel 1:26).|$|E
60|$|For Dilsberg is {{a quaint}} place. It is most quaintly and picturesquely situated, too. Imagine the {{beautiful}} river before you; {{then a few}} rods of brilliant green sward on its opposite shore; then a sudden hill--no preparatory gently rising slopes, but a sort of instantaneous hill--a hill {{two hundred and fifty}} or three hundred feet high, as round as a bowl, with the same taper upward that an <b>inverted</b> <b>bowl</b> has, and with about the same relation of height to diameter that distinguishes a bowl of good honest depth--a hill which is thickly clothed with green bushes--a comely, shapely hill, rising abruptly out of the dead level of the surrounding green plains, visible from a great distance down the bends of the river, and with just exactly room on the top of its head for its steepled and turreted and roof-clustered cap of architecture, which same is tightly jammed and compacted within the perfectly round hoop of the ancient village wall.|$|E
60|$|From her {{recollection}} of Alec's words, Lucy {{tried to make}} out the scene that first met her brother's eyes. She seemed to stand by his side, leaning over the rail, as the ship approached the harbour. The sea was blue with a blue she had never seen, and the sky was like an <b>inverted</b> <b>bowl</b> of copper. The low shore, covered with bush, stretched away in the distance; a line of waves was breaking on the reef. They came in sight of the island of Mombassa, with the overgrown ruins of a battery that had once commanded the entrance; and there were white-roofed houses, with deep verandas, which stood in little clearings with coral cliffs below them. On the opposite shore thick groves of palm-trees rose with their singular, melancholy beauty. Then as the channel narrowed, they passed an old Portuguese fort which carried the mind back to the bold adventurers who had first sailed those distant seas, and directly afterwards a mass of white buildings that reached {{to the edge of the}} lapping waves. They saw the huts of the native town, wattled and thatched, nestling close together; and below them was a fleet of native craft. On the jetty was the African crowd, shouting and jostling, some half-naked, and some strangely clad, Arabs from across the sea, Swahilis, and here and there a native from the interior.|$|E
25|$|The {{towers in}} the qibla wall {{do not contain}} stairs linking the prayer hall with the roof. Instead there are two square towers housing stairs leading to the roof. One set of stairs {{is located at the}} south western corner of the prayer hall while the other set, {{situated}} near the main entrance on the northern side, is only accessible from the exterior of the mosque.

50|$|A bell tree (often {{confused}} with the mark tree) is a percussion instrument, consisting of vertically nested <b>inverted</b> metal <b>bowls.</b> The bowls, placed on a vertical rod, are arranged roughly in order of pitch. The number of bowls can vary between approximately 14 and 28. An effective glissando is produced by sliding a triangle beater, a glockenspiel mallet, or a xylophone mallet {{down the length of}} the tree. When a glissando is played, the inexactness of the order of the bowls' pitch is unnoticeable, merely creating a fuller sound.|$|R

60|$|Mackintosh {{had slept}} badly {{and he looked}} with distaste at the paw-paw and the eggs and bacon which were set before him. The {{mosquitoes}} had been maddening that night; they flew about the net under which he slept in such numbers that their humming, pitiless and menacing, {{had the effect of}} a note, infinitely drawn out, played on a distant organ, and whenever he dozed off he awoke with a start in the belief that one had found its way inside his curtains. It was so hot that he lay naked. He turned from side to side. And gradually the dull roar of the breakers on the reef, so unceasing and so regular that generally you did not hear it, grew distinct on his consciousness, its rhythm hammered on his tired nerves and he held himself with clenched hands in the effort to bear it. The thought that nothing could stop that sound, for it would continue to all eternity, was almost impossible to bear, and, as though his strength were a match for the ruthless forces of nature, he had an insane impulse to do some violent thing. He felt he must cling to his self-control or he would go mad. And now, looking out of the window at the lagoon and the strip of foam which marked the reef, he shuddered with hatred of the brilliant scene. The cloudless sky was like an <b>inverted</b> <b>bowl</b> that hemmed it in. He lit his pipe and turned over the pile of Auckland papers that had come over from Apia a few days before. The newest of them was three weeks old. They gave an impression of incredible dullness.|$|E

25|$|The inverse is {{also true}} when the {{aircraft}} is in inverted flight. The float becomes submerged as the fuel is pulled downward by gravity {{to the top of}} the fuel bowl.

With the fuel inlet valve open, the fuel pump continues pumping fuel into the fuel bowl, where the resulting excess fuel causes the fuel-air ratio to become lower than nine to one, which is then too rich for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|R

50|$|According to {{architectural}} {{historian and}} Wright scholar Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer, “When {{he received a}} commission for a church for the Milwaukee Hellenic Community, Wright consulted his wife, who {{was brought up in}} the Greek Orthodox faith, about the predominant symbols of the church. “The cross and the dome,” was her reply.” These two architectural forms dominate the design. The floor plan itself is a Greek cross. Wide arches support the upper level, or balcony. The roof dome sits atop an <b>inverted</b> dome, or <b>bowl.</b> Through simplification and abstraction of the forms, Wright succeeded in artfully translating the cross and the dome from their historical Byzantine context to the vastly dissimilar setting of the twentieth-century American Midwest.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the top of}} the gyro assembly, {{above the}} compensator, right on center, is an exciter coil fed with {{low-voltage}} AC.

One coil is displaced by 90 degrees. If the bowl (called an [...] "umbrella") is not centered above the exciter coil, either or both coils have an output that represents the offset. This voltage is phase-detected and amplified to drive two DC servo motors to position the umbrella in line with the coil.|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of karawitan in West Java {{led to a}} debate among the artists. This study attempted to reveal various factors which had led to the debate by comparing the kerawitan jaipongan to the previous tradition. In this way, {{it was hoped that}} the differences in elements between the karawitan jaipongan and the kerawitan previously performed in the Sundanese tradition could be revealed. The elements discussed included the waditra (instruments) such as bonang (gamelan instrument consisting of row of tuned <b>inverted</b> bronze <b>bowls),</b> goong, kecrek (pieces of metal on strings which are made to rattle for sound effects), and kendang (small drum covered with leather on each side). Through these objects, it could be known that the kerawitan jaipongan was a new creation created by the artists as the rules in it were different and tended to deviate from those applicable in the Sundanese tradition. Based on the analysis, it could be concluded that the debate in the karawitan japipongan started from the five waditra (instruments) as they were regarded as deviating from the original story in the Sundanese tradition.

When you stood inside of one of those <b>inverted</b> <b>bowls</b> of a Pre-Adamite tobacco-pipe, looking up at the blue sky through the open top far off, as you might have looked up from a well, sunk under the centre of the pavement of the Pantheon at Rome, had you the least idea where you were? And when you found yourself surrounded, in that dome-shaped cavern, by innumerable columns of an unearthly order of architecture, supporting nothing, and squeezed close together as if a Pre-Adamite Samson had taken a vast Hall in his arms and crushed it into the smallest possible space, had you the least idea what they were? No (says the plate), of course not! And when you found that each of those pillars was a pile of ingeniously made vessels of coarse clay - called Saggers - looking, when separate, like raised-pies for the table of the mighty Giant Blunderbore, and now all full of various articles of pottery ranged in them in baking order, the bottom of each vessel serving for the cover of the one below, and the whole Kiln rapidly filling with these, tier upon tier, until the last workman should have barely room to crawl out, before the closing of the jagged aperture in the wall and the kindling of the gradual fire; did you not stand amazed to think that all the year round these dread chambers are heating, white hot - and cooling - and filling - and emptying - and being bricked up - and broken open - humanly speaking, for ever and ever? To be sure you did! And standing in one of those Kilns nearly full, and seeing a free crow shoot across the aperture a-top, and learning how the fire would wax hotter and hotter by slow degrees, and would cool similarly through a space of from forty to sixty hours, did no remembrance of the days when human clay was burnt oppress you? Yes. I think so! I suspect that some fancy of a fiery haze and a shortening breath, and a growing heat, and a gasping prayer; and a figure in black interposing between you and the sky (as figures in black are very apt to do), and looking down, before it grew too hot to look and live, upon the Heretic in his edifying agony - I say I suspect (says the plate) that some such fancy was pretty strong upon you when you went out into the air, and blessed God for the bright spring day and the degenerate times! ...|$|R
60|$|About bedtime I {{took the}} king to my private {{quarters}} {{to cut his}} hair and help him {{get the hang of}} the lowly raiment he was to wear. The high classes wore their hair banged across the forehead but hanging to the shoulders {{the rest of the way}} around, whereas the lowest ranks of commoners were banged fore and aft both; the slaves were bangless, and allowed their hair free growth. So I <b>inverted</b> a <b>bowl</b> over his head and cut away all the locks that hung below it. I also trimmed his whiskers and mustache until they were only about a half-inch long; and tried to do it inartistically, and succeeded. It was a villainous disfigurement. When he got his lubberly sandals on, and his long robe of coarse brown linen cloth, which hung straight from his neck to his ankle-bones, he was no longer the comeliest man in his kingdom, but one of the unhandsomest and most commonplace and unattractive. We were dressed and barbered alike, and could pass for small farmers, or farm bailiffs, or shepherds, or carters; yes, or for village artisans, if we chose, our costume being in effect universal among the poor, because of its strength and cheapness. I don't mean that it was really cheap to a very poor person, but I do mean that it was the cheapest material there was for male attire--manufactured material, you understand.|$|R
