40|$|Pot {{experiment}} was conducted using <b>eggplants</b> (Solanum melongena L.) grown {{in a controlled}} growth chamber environment. Ambient (370 ppm) and elevated (700 ppm) CO 2 concentrations, were used. Hydraulic conductance in stressed <b>eggplants</b> was {{lower than that of}} control <b>eggplants</b> and this phenomenon was enhanced under elevated CO 2 environment and also due to plant age. Hydraulic conductance through the root system in free water was comparatively higher than that of soil medium. As in the pressure plate apparatus technique with moist soil, the <b>eggplants</b> that experienced repetitively shorter stress showed the lowest conductance (6. 38 × 10 - 5 kg/m 2 /s/MPa) under the interactive effects of high CO 2 and water stress while control and longer stressed plants had 9. 11 × 10 - 5 and 7. 19 × 10 - 5 kg/m 2 /s/MPa, respectively. It appeared that <b>eggplants</b> grown in a high CO 2 environment might be efficient in water use under soil water shortage conditions...|$|R

25|$|Many of the {{pests and}} {{diseases}} that afflict other solanaceous plants, such as tomato, capsicum, and potato, are also troublesome to <b>eggplants.</b> For this reason, it should generally not be planted in areas previously occupied by its close relatives. However, since <b>eggplants</b> {{can be particularly}} susceptible to pests such as whiteflies, they are sometimes grown with slightly less susceptible plants, such as pepper, as a sacrificial trap crop. Four years should separate successive crops of <b>eggplants</b> to reduce pest pressure.|$|R

5|$|Proper post-harvest storage {{aimed at}} {{extending}} and ensuring shelf life is best effected by efficient cold chain application. Cold storage is particularly useful for vegetables such as cauliflower, <b>eggplant,</b> lettuce, radish, spinach, potatoes, and tomatoes, the optimum temperature {{depending on the}} type of produce. There are temperature-controlling technologies that do not require the use of electricity such as evaporative cooling. Storage of fruit and vegetables in controlled atmospheres with high levels of carbon dioxide or high oxygen levels can inhibit microbial growth and extend storage life.|$|E
5|$|A dish {{native to}} the Gaza area is Sumaghiyyeh, {{consisting}} of water-soaked ground sumac mixed with tahina. The mixture is added to sliced chard and pieces of stewed beef and garbanzo beans and additionally flavored with dill seeds, garlic and hot peppers. It is often eaten cool with khubz.

5|$|In about 1840, L. decemlineata {{adopted the}} {{cultivated}} potato into its host range and it rapidly became a most destructive pest of potato crops. They are today {{considered to be}} the most important insect defoliator of potatoes. They may also cause significant damage to tomato and <b>eggplant</b> crops with both adults and larvae feeding on the plant's foliage. Larvae may defoliate potato plants resulting in yield losses of up to 100% if the damage occurs prior to tuber formation. Larvae may consume 40cm2 of potato leaves during the entire larval stage, but adults are capable of consuming 10cm2 of foliage per day.|$|E
