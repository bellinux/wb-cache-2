6000|$|If {{the reader}} has any doubts upon the point, let him imagine a time when, as used {{to happen in}} the days of our forefathers, almost {{everybody}} suffered from smallpox at some period of their lives, those escaping only whose blood was so fortified by nature that the disease could not touch them. Let him imagine a state of affairs--and there are still people living whose parents could remember it--when for a woman not to be pitted with smallpox was to give her some claim to beauty, however homely might be her features. Lastly, let him imagine what all this means: what terror walked abroad when it was common for smallpox to strike a family of children, and when the parents, themselves the survivors of similar catastrophes, knew well that before it left the house it would take its tithe of those beloved lives. Let him look at the brasses in our old churches and among the numbers of children represented on them as kneeling behind their parents; let him note what a large proportion pray with their hands open. Of these, the most, I believe, were cut off by smallpox. Let him search the registers, and they will tell the same tale. Let him ask old people of what their mothers told them when they were young of the working of this pestilence in their youth. Finally, let him consider how it comes about, if vaccination is a fraud, that some nine hundred and ninety-nine medical men out of every thousand, not in England only, but in all civilised countries, place so firm a belief in its virtue. Are the <b>doctors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> all mad, or all engaged in a great conspiracy to suppress the truth? ...|$|E

This has important consequences for <b>the</b> early diagnosis <b>of</b> rheumatic disease and <b>the</b> proper care <b>of</b> rheumatic patients in general, as well as for <b>the</b> esteem <b>of</b> rheumatology as a profession. Because the high prevalence and impact of rheumatic disease are not reflected in medical curricula, <b>the</b> International League <b>of</b> Associations for Rheumatology developed the Undergraduate Medical Education in Rheumatology 2000 Project. The project embodies three fundamental concepts: (1) to convince medical faculties and schools educating health professionals world wide that skills in examination, a knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> musculoskeletal disease and a positive attitude to disability are <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> good medical practice; (2) that rheumatology is valuable for acquiring skills in problem-solving, clinical reasoning and understanding basic genetic, immunological and biochemical mechanisms, as illustrated by rheumatic disease; and (3) to orient these programmes to <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> individual patients in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population at large, knowing that 20 % of all primary care consultations involve musculoskeletal disease. <b>The</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>doctors</b> throughout <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> especially within Europe, is leading to initiatives to harmonize standards <b>of</b> specialist training. <b>The</b> importance <b>of</b> ensuring <b>the</b> highest standard <b>of</b> clinical care, achieving the greatest gain in health alongside a rapid advance in knowledge and clinical practice, is increasing the priority for continuing medical education and methods to ensure that doctors remain competent at all stages of their career...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> Philosophy (PhD) <b>The</b> <b>world’s</b> {{population}} is ageing, {{and the oldest}} age group is the fastest growing segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population in developed countries. This thesis aimed to investigate whether <b>the</b> last years <b>of</b> life, which {{for more and more}} people are occurring at a greater age, are spent in good or poor health. Specifically, the work in this thesis investigated heterogeneity in <b>the</b> ageing experience <b>of</b> older Australian women, by estimating trajectories of physical functioning, mental health, and sleep, in late life. Baseline predictors for <b>the</b> maintenance <b>of</b> good health, and change in health, were explored. We found that the ageing experience is highly varied, with some older women experiencing excellent physical health, mental health, and sleep. However, we also found sub-groups of women who did not age well. Factors associated with ageing well included entering old age in good health, at a healthy weight, participating in regular physical activity, fewer chronic diseases, higher education, and having no financial difficulty. These findings regarding <b>the</b> diversity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ageing experience have implications for public policy. Public policy largely focuses on the physical care needs of older persons, and lacks programs tailored towards preventing poor health and maintaining good health. This reactive approach, dealing largely with <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> older people who are already in poor health, misses a valuable opportunity to maximise <b>the</b> potential <b>of</b> others to remain in good health, and to capitalise upon them as a valuable resource. While current policy providing care and support for those in poor health should be maintained, also required are a greater number of preventative policies to ensure more people reach old age in good health, as well as policies aimed at maintaining good health throughout later life...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> Philosophy (PhD) <b>The</b> <b>world’s</b> ageing {{population}} means that many older people {{in developed countries}} now live out <b>the</b> latter parts <b>of</b> their lives in Long-Term Care (LTC) settings such as Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACFs). <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older people in LTC settings have problems with cognition {{and a range of}} debilitating chronic conditions associated with frailty which means they are dependent on others for <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> everyday living. South Korea has one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world’s</b> fastest growing ageing populations. The catalyst for this study was <b>the</b> instigation <b>of</b> a national government LTC insurance system in South Korea in 2008 and issues and concerns about <b>the</b> Quality <b>of</b> Care (QOC) in RACFs. <b>The</b> introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LTC system highlighted <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> care standards for care provision in RACFs in South Korea. The research study reported in this thesis used modified Delphi methodology for <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> care standards for RACFs in South Korea. Methods included; 1) Document analysis of international care standards from Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, 2) qualitative descriptive analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transcriptions <b>of</b> focus group meetings held with residents, their families and older people within the community, and 3) Analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assessment data relating to the health and functional status of Korean residents. A pilot study was conducted <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Delphi method which was followed by three rounds of Delphi to complete the data collection, analysis and development of standards. Donabedian’s framework was used to inform the quality care elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> care standards. A suite of standards for care in RACFs, underpinned by international principles of care for older people, comprising 15 statements of standards and 155 criteria, were developed. International, cultural, social and individual requirements for care are reflected in <b>the</b> standards. <b>Of</b> importance is that the care standards may assist the South Korean Government’s National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) policy makers to ensure <b>the</b> provision <b>of</b> culturally appropriate care in RACFs. In addition, they may guide Quality Assurance (QA) activities for private and public service providers. Finally, the findings from this research provide nurses with an opportunity to {{play a central role in}} <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gerontological nursing specialty in South Korea.

40|$|Research Doctorate - <b>Doctor</b> <b>of</b> Philosophy (PhD) <b>The</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> {{public school}} {{education}} systems is currently experiencing a reform phenomenon in which almost exclusively, <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> reform {{is to create}} decentralized models of school governance described as school-based management (SBM). Issues such as <b>the</b> challenges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global knowledge economy are fuelling the focus on SBM {{as a means of}} providing educational opportunities essential for the nations to remain competitive. An important component <b>of</b> SBM is <b>the</b> school council or board which is the vehicle for shared governance. Since the 1970 's, Australia has become a <b>world</b> leader in <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> SBM. In particular, the initiatives by <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> Victoria played a lead role while continuing to refine and fine-tune its SBM focus as the key principle underpinning development of its large public education system. New South Wales (NSW) attempted to introduce SBM in the early 1970 's and on several occasions since but was unsuccessful until 1990. <b>The</b> model <b>of</b> SBM, its introduction and political commitments have differed between NSW and Victoria. This study compared <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> school councils in each state as an indicator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effectivemess <b>of</b> SBM. <b>The</b> research was conducted in 2006 using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies comprising of an empirical survey with a sample of 100 Victorian and 150 NSW schools ans semi-structured interviews with 41 participants belonging to all categories of stakeholders as well as documentary analyses. Data generated from <b>the</b> two phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research correlated strongly and identified a number of important issues. Most principals see school councils as supportive of their role but ironically, <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> a school council is dependent on the knowledge, skills and commitment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> principal. School councils in Victoria are significantly more effective when compared to NSW, however, the data indicated that <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> school councils can and should be broadened and strengthened in both states. Although at the schools where school councils have been established in NSW there is general support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept, there is confusion about the place and future of school councils especially in view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> luke-warm support they receive from the NSW bureaucracy...|$|R
