This paper reports on the results. A DUPIC (Direct Use of Spent PWR Fuel In CANDU) fuelled CANDU reactor was used as a test case in order to develop appropriate methods for the identification and analysis of plausible acquisition paths and to determine the multiplicity and robustness of barriers against proliferation. The study resulted in several recommendations: •	The proliferation assessment should be performed at three levels: the State level, the INS (Innovative Nuclear Energy System) level, and the facility level. •	The robustness of barriers against proliferation depends on the State’s capabilities, and the relevance of each barrier is dependent on assessment level. •	The robustness of barriers is not a function of individual barrier characteristics but is an integrated function of all of the barriers, and is measured by determining whether the safeguards goals can be met. •	The <b>INPRO</b> assessment methodology requires information regarding proliferation risks derived from quantitative analysis. The PRADA study identified several areas where the <b>INPRO</b> proliferation resistance manual could be expanded and improved: 1) through a better explanation of acceptance limits, 2) through a restructuring of the evaluation tables, and 3) by provision of more explanatory details. An important conclusion was a proposal to form a “GIF (Generation IV International Forum) / <b>INPRO</b> coordinated set of Proliferation Resistance and safeguardability assessment tools”. This set of tools would bring together the complementary strengths of the GIF and <b>INPRO</b> approaches and demonstrate that the two methods can be used in harmony and provide consistent results.

One outcome is the definition of the „Open ICT Platform‟ (OIP). Work Package 4 - Task T 4. 2 – „Open Standards for Interoperability between Applications in Early Design‟, led by AEC 3, provided the short term and long term requirements for the Open ICT Platform. The main outcome of task T 4. 2, the deliverable D 6, specifies the Open ICT Platform ac-cording to the OIP requirements described in the deliverable D 1 [Nummelin 2007] of the preceding task T 4. 1 and the seven key processes described in the deliverable D 5 of task T 2. 1 [Outters & Verhofstad 2007]. The strong focus on the key processes has been iden-tified as an important and necessary addition to the original scope of work. Solution The Open web-based ICT Platform – the BIM Collaboration Hub – is available for the in-dustry as a test environment, as a "sandbox", for the users to play with. It is "reset" fre-quently, to enable repetition of tests etc. This sandbox will then also contain the parts/extensions for <b>InPro.</b> The Open web-based ICT platform is {{to be seen as a}} technical solution how to map the information available in the different applications, key processes and also the demonstra-tions. The mapping of this information is in the context of the platform, in this case the PLCS standard as being the bases for Share-A-space (the model server). The prototypes of the applications around the server will be publicly available and de-scriptions of the mappings can be seen as a platform definition. The Open web-based ICT Platform shows the principal idea or way of working, not neces-sarily the exact way of industry today. It is a kind of a proof of concept in a laboratory environment. In terms of Technology Readiness Level, the platform is on level 3 or 4. The main part of the Open Web-based ICT Platform for <b>InPro</b> is the BIM Collaboration Hub, which is based on the model server Share-A-space. For viewing and linking the Solibri Model Server is used, and for model checking the Solibri Model Checker. Share-A-space is a commercial software in use at a number of industries and organiza-tions. Share-A-space has all the functions required for the manufacturing industry for PDM and PLM collaboration and information consolidation. With the <b>InPro</b> additions and modifications, these generic functions are now available also for the construction indus-try.

The dynamic, normativity, equity, and integration principles should underpin any assessment of sustainability. This approach requires methodologies and tools suitable for a proper analysis of sustainability. In this view, the assessment of nuclear energy sustainability is a challenging task where economic aspects, environmental objectives, and social tensions are pronounced. The International Atomic Energy Agency has developed a framework for the assessment of nuclear energy sustainability named <b>INPRO</b> methodology.

This paper summarizes four of the SRES scenarios, one {{from each of the}} four SRES scenario families.

Present practice of plutonium recycling in PWR is replaced {{by the middle of the}} century by a global recycling of actinides, uranium, plutonium and minor actinides in fast reactors. The status and the evolution of the INPRO’s criteria and the corresponding indicators during the studied period are analyzed for each of the six considered areas: economics, safety, environment, waste management, proliferation resistance and infrastructure. Improvements on economic and safety are expected for both the EPR and the 4 th generation systems having these improvements among their basic goals. The use of fast reactors and global recycling of actinides leads to a significant improvement on environment indicators and in particular on the natural resources utilization.

40|$|In this master thesis, optical {{dissolved}} oxygen (DO) sensors are compared to standard electrochemical DO-sensors. The optical sensors are also compared against each other. DO {{is an important}} parameter to measure and to control during microorganism fermentation.  A DO-sensor needs to fulfill certain criteria, such as; purposive response time, the ability to show accurate and stable readings without drift over time, {{have the capability to}} manage several sterilizations and exhibiting membrane fouling resistance. The reference used to test these parameters was an industrially accepted electrochemical sensor. By comparing the two technologies, optical sensors showed similar abilities to perform regarding response time and drift performance during the longer test runs. But the optical sensors showed a better performance during sterilizations, with less drift in raw value. When using electrochemical sensors as a reference, different brands of optical sensor gave different results when testing for accuracy at different concentration levels. Due to error in the method, tests for fouling were inconclusive. However, membranes from the two kinds of technologies showed an equal hydrophobic character. The two participating optical DO sensors, Mettler Toledo <b>InPro</b> 6990 i and Hamilton Visiferm were compared regarding ability to manage sterilizations and generate accurate measuring values at different DO concentrations. The two sensor brands showed an equal behavior during the fifteen test sterilizations. The Mettler Toledo <b>InPro</b> 6990 had better abilities to follow the linear behavior of the electrochemical reference sensor. While the  Hamilton Visiferm sensor differed at most 3. 5 % units from the electrochemical reference values. Hamilton Visiferm was tested with analogue signal, which gave a noise problem. When using digital signal the noise disappeared. The goal {{of this study was to}} recommend a sensor, for Belach Bioteknik AB, and the recommendation would be Hamilton Visiferm, for being practical as well as reasonable priced without renounce of measuring quality...|$|E

40|$|Proliferation {{resistance}} (PR) {{evaluations of}} nuclear energy systems provide a structured approach for assessing the value of both intrinsic and extrinsic barriers to proliferation. Ultimately, PR studies allow an evaluation of proposed safeguards, an identification of potential weaknesses or alternative safeguard approaches, and a basis for improving and enhancing safeguards. Decisions affecting the proliferation resistance of a nuclear energy system {{are likely to be}} made over the complete facility life-cycle, from concept selection, system design, system engineering, prototype development and evaluation, export arrangements, system performance reviews, facility operation, through needed system upgrades, and finally at facility end-of-life. Valid and useful information must be available to allow decision makers to make informed PR-related decisions at each step along the way, and it must be recognized that reevaluations are likely to be required over time as knowledge and circumstances evolve. To be useful, PR evaluations must be carried out following a standardized approach that has international acceptance and that provides consistent results independent of the analysts carrying out the evaluation. Proliferation assessment methodologies such as those being developed under the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) and IAEA¿s International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (<b>INPRO)</b> provide the technical platforms for supporting overall evaluations, but their findings are unlikely to be directly used by decision makers. This situation arises because, while all PR evaluation approaches develop valuable information about the proliferation resistance of a nuclear energy system, a significant effort is still required to make results of PR evaluation usable and understandable to decision makers. This paper identifies a reference set of decision makers and other users who could be informed by the results of proliferation resistance assessments. Whether the <b>INPRO,</b> GIF, or another methodology is used, the need for useful, information about the PR of their systems must be met. The paper examines the information needs of different classes of decision makers, and describes some ideas on how the results of the various PR studies can be interpreted and presented to them in a more usable, understandable fashion.

A comparative analysis of different aspects of the algorithm with other algorithms described in the literature such as Sparse Pixel Vectorization, spatial moving average filtering and Principal Component Analysis is performed, hence establishing the qualities of this paper-based scribble simplification algorithm. To quantify the performance of the algorithm, performance measures established in the literature, such as the Pixel Recovery Index are used when suitable. However, since there exists no quantitative measure which measures scribble simplification, this paper proposes a new methodology with which scribble simplification may be quantitatively assessed. Through the evaluation described in this paper, {{we will be able to}} determine remaining difficulties in the interpretation of paper-based scribbles and hence identify future research areas. peer-reviewe...|$|E

However, despite the number of sketching tools such as PDAs and Tablet PCs available on market, designers typically create a number of initial conceptual ideas using paper-based sketches and scribbles such that these tools remain inaccessible to designers in the early design stages. In this paper we describe a profile-driven, paper-based sketching interface which infers the 3 D geometry of objects drawn by designers using the traditional pen and paper sketching. We show that by making full use of the shape information present in the scribbled drawing, it is possible to obtain a paper-based sketching interface that retains the simplicity of the early- stage design drawings while allowing for the modeling of a variety of object shapes. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo improve {{construction}} {{performance and}} sustainability {{there is a}} need for improved through life support. Customers, clients, suppliers and society have needs and requirements that have to be captured and formalized to govern the goals of design and production and finally operation and maintenance. This requires continuous information about the real estate and city properties, all in open and transparent standards. The information needs to be collected, stored, processed, integrated, extracted, visualized and interpreted, something that requires advanced information systems and deep domain knowledge. BIM repositories will become a necessity for the ability to manage changes and consolidations/synchronizations of heterogeneous applications. Integrated planning, integrated design with multiple alternatives and functional, spatial interfaces, and integrated supply chains with system performance requirements and specifications,the important functionalities of IDDS, Integrated Design and Delivery Solutions, are examples on possible usages of a BIM repository. This paper presents the planned and also performed studies of a BIM collaboration Lab, which are based on the experience and results from the BIM Collaboration Hub and the research in the EU project <b>InPro.</b> It also demonstrates how the experiments in the lab are supported by through life support standards...|$|E
