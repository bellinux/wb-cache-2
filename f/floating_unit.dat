The criterion for static stability is easy to establish. Two examples demonstrate how static stability de-pends on the weather conditions.

The choice of scale between the model and the platform in which the tests took place was a very important issue that took into account the basin dimensions and mooring design. The tests were performed in three different basins: the IPT Towing Tank in Brazil (Sept. 2005), the NMRI Model Ship Experimental Towing Tank in Japan (Mar. 2007), and the NMRI Experimental Tank in Japan (Jun. 2008).

40|$|Floating point units form an {{important}} component of many reconfigurable computing applications. The creation of floating point units under a collection of area, latency, and throughput constraints is {{an important}} consideration for system designers. Given the range of possible tradeoffs, most commercial or academic floating point libraries for FPGAs provide a small fraction of possible floating point units. In contrast, the <b>floating</b> <b>unit</b> generation approach outlined in this paper allows for the creation of more than 200 different floating point units, with differing area, throughput, and latency characteristics. These variations are supported through selection of a floating point architecture and the use of floating point unit pipelining.

Given requirements on throughput, area and latency, our generation flow automatically chooses the proper algorithm and architecture to create a floating point unit which fulfills design requirements.

This issue is more difficult and complex for offshore fields, because all or {{most parts of the}} equipment are located in the sea. For Block Hanoi Trough - 02 there is no exception. All equipment is planned to be installed in the sea. However, FSO is the only <b>floating</b> <b>unit</b> in this oilfield. FSO is the cheapest solution, due to absence of the onshore infrastructure.

40|$|Today, {{the natural}} gas {{consumption}} is substantially increasing and the forecast for the future indicates that the consumption will keep on increasing. The result {{of this is that}} new innovative solutions are introduced to satisfy the demand from the customers. One of the latest ideas is to use a so-called FSRU GTW-unit, which is a <b>floating</b> <b>unit</b> that contains all the necessary process steps to produce electricity from LNG. This means that the unit will import LNG from a shuttle tanker and export electricity to shore. The objective with this thesis is to identify the hazards relevant to an FSRU GTW-concept and present requirements and recommendations. The hazards in question are those that can risk the safety of personnel, operability and structural integrity. The requirements and recommendations are based on an evaluation of how the hazards are addressed in existing rules and regulations provided by DNV and IMO. This can then be used as input to future rule development. In order to present relevant requirements and recommendations, it is essential to study existing rules in order to find what is applicable on an FSRU GTW-unit, and if there are any gaps or contradictions that need consideration. The rules and regulations that are thoroughly analysed are those provided by DNV and IMO. This analysis is preceded by a thorough study of related technologies and an evaluation of what hazards that are explicitly related to an FSRU GTW-unit. This is done according to IMO’s FSA-methodology with the aid of experts in the fields of electrical equipment, rotating machinery and offshore gas projects at DNV in Hövik, Norway. The FSA-methodology is a risk-based approach used for developing rules and the parts used in this work are those concerning the identification of hazards. It is concluded that there are contradictions and gaps in DNV’s present rules and regulations when applying these on an FSRU GTW-unit. It is, for example, stated by IMO in the IGC Code that boilers, machinery and such should be segregated from the storage facilities. This imposes a problem since the power plant, which consists of such equipment, will most probably be mounted on top of the storage tanks. Furthermore, there exist no explicit rules or design guidelines concerning electrical transmission through a turret.

40|$|This Master {{thesis is}} a {{continuation}} of a project thesis written fall 2012 ?Evaluation of Liquefaction systems for Floating LNG?. Two processes for liquefaction of natural gas for a <b>floating</b> <b>unit</b> was compared and evaluated. The main basis for comparison came from simulations conducted in the simulation program Aspen HYSYS. These two processes were a dual mixed refrigerant process, DMR, from Air Products and Chemicals and a turbo-expander process from TOTAL. (Ref) The specific power consumptions for the processes were 284 kWh/ton LNG for the DMR process and 395. 8 kWh/ton LNG for TOTALs turbo-expander process. Two additional liquefaction processes were simulated and studied in this Master thesis; a turbo-expander process from APCI and a turbo-expander from US patent 5, 768, 912. (Ref) The simulations gave a specific power consumption of 405. 7 kWh/ton LNG for APCIs turbo-expander process and 422. 5 kWh/ton LNG for the US patent model. These models were compared with the mixed refrigerant process from APCI and TOTALs turbo-expander process in terms of power consumption, volume flow rates of refrigerant and heat exchanger properties. The expander processes from TOTAL and APCI were dual expanders while the process from US patent 5, 768, 912 had three turbo-expanders. All expander processes were simulated with a CO 2 precooling system. The liquefaction units had a production capacity of 3. 5 Mtpa of LNG. The equipment in the DMR process was assumed large enough to handle the production capacity while the turbo-expander processes had to be divided in several production trains. The limitations for the expander process were a maximum compander capacity of 15 MW. TOTALs and APCIs turbo-expander had expander powers of respectively 49 and 55 MW for the largest expander in the processes and were divided into four trains. The turbo-expander from US patent was suggested with two production trains with a released power of 29 MW for the largest expander. A common CO 2 system served the parallel trains for the turbo-expander processes. Process parameters of feed gas composition and pressure, water cooling temperature and split temperatures in the processes were some of the parameters included in a sensitivity analysis of the processes. A richer feed composition and a higher feed gas pressure gave reductions in power consumptions due to higher condensing temperature of the natural gas. Alternative systems for the precooling units with several evaporation stages of the CO 2 were also studied and compared with the initial precooling system of one evaporation stage. A CO 2 system with three evaporation stages gave reductions in specific power consumption of 0. 6 %, 2. 1 % and 4. 7 % for the expander processes from TOTAL, APCI and US patent respectively. The liquefaction processes were suggested with electric drive of the compressors. LM 6000 gas turbines were used for drivers of the processes. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{floating}} {{production system}} (FPS) {{consists of a}} floating structure, a mooring system, anchors and risers. Such systems enable production for larger ocean depths. Risers are vertical pipes used for transportation of production fluids between the seabed and the production unit. FPS and its components are presented and discussed in this thesis. Using an FPS entails certain challenges; risers, for instance, need other properties than for fixed structures, as they will hang from the <b>floating</b> <b>unit,</b> and {{must be able to}} absorb vessel movement. FPS is also a good option in remote areas with little infrastructure, as for the Barents Sea. When operating in arctic areas, additional challenges connected to the environment must be considered. In this thesis, challenges such as darkness, low temperatures and ice issues are identified and categorised. The Goliat field is the first operating field to start production of oil in arctic areas. At this field, a circular Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) unit operates, and it is equipped with flexible risers. A model of this circular FPSO is modeled as a uniform cylinder with a draught of 32. 2 metres. A 644 metre long steep wave flexible riser is modelled to span between the platform and the seabed in the 400 metre deep water. A parameter study is performed to investigate the influence on the riser response. The analyses are performed in RILFEX, a software utilized for static and dynamic analysis of slender marine structures. The varying parameters are the current profile, the riser diameter and the drag coefficient. An analysis for varying horizontal offset of the platform, relative to the riser's touch down point (TDP) on the seabed, is also performed. The platform position that results in lowest effective tension in the riser, is 250 metres away from TDP. For this case, the riser also has lowest response amplitude. Analyses are performed for three current profiles, uniform current, linear current and no current. It is found that by increasing the current, curvature near the riser top decreases. The case where linear current is applied, the largest tension in the riser occurs. Current variation also leads to change in the vertical displacement. For the case with no current, the riser top has a larger displacement in the negative z-direction, compared to the cases when current is applied. The next parameter subject to change is the diameter, and three cases were studied. For increasing diameter, the weight is also increased, and the additional buoyancy due to increased volume, does not even out the added weight. As a consequence, some results might be affected more by the weight change, rather than by the change of diameter. Regarding curvature and tension, the two risers with largest diameter and weight behaves similarly, compared to the smallest riser. The two largest diameters experience larger tension and have less curvature at the hangoff, which corresponds with the additional weight. The last parameter that was studied was the drag coefficient. For variation in diameter and drag, the displacement in vertical direction is only slightly affected near the riser top. As it is the riser properties that are changed, rather than external loading, the vessel motion is not significantly affected. The vertical displacement of the riser is affected more by change of riser properties at positions further from the vessel...|$|E
40|$|This thesis used {{different}} methods to model and predict the fatiguefrom wave loads on the tensile armor layers in a flexible riser in thebending stiffener area. The additional {{aim of the}} thesis was to givethe reader an understanding of flexible pipes and risers, and presentthe necessary theory to understand and complete a dynamic analysisof riser with the finite element method, {{and how to do}} lifetimepredictions from irregular time series. Different methodologies exist for fatigue calculations for risers. However,the general approach is to use the wave response from a globalriser model, and to apply this to a local model which has a moreaccurate representation of the pipe?s cross-section. The actual fatiguecalculations are done using a SN-curve and Miner sum. Thevariations of the {{different methods}} lie in how the models are made,what kind of wave loads the global model is subjected to, and whatloads are used and how these loads are transformed in to the localmodel. The scenario was a new field development close to the Enchova fieldlocated in the Campos Basin off the Coast of Rio De Janeiro. Thisfield will be developed with a turret moored <b>floating</b> <b>unit</b> with lazywaveriser configuration at a water depth of 125 meters. The systemwas modeled with simple tubular elements given the pipe?s bendingstiffness in slip. An irregular wave analysis using the local wave dataiiwas conducted. The transformation of the global time series was done using the Rainflowmethod. The range spectra were divided into 40 bins. Threedifferent local models were made in BFLEX. The first model, M 1,was a stub, just a representation of the pipe?s cross-section. Thisis a known approach in the industry. The two last models, M 2 andM 3, were full sized representations of the bending stiffener, whichwere submitted to axial and lateral loads by decomposing the tensionwith the riser?s hang-off angle. This approach is less used. M 2 and M 3 used different types of elements. Their difference is in theway the tensile armor layer is represented. M 2 and M 3 have shown to give a less conservative result than M 1. This can be understood from the fact that M 2 and M 3 give a morerealistic representation of the load history. They capture other effectsas well, like for instance the interaction between the pipe andthe bending stiffener (BS) at the BS-tip. It was shown that the BS was too stiff in the local model, this resultedin an abrupt curvature response at the BS-tip. M 2 sufferedthe most to this to this. The fatigue response in M 3 was more jaggedalong the riser than the response in M 2. A comparison of M 3 with amore refined mesh was conducted. This did not give the desired improvement. The jaggedness could be understood from nature of theshear interaction model in ITCODE 0, whereas ITCODE 31 uses elementarybeam theory after the moment-curvature relationship hasbeen calculated. The M 3 model showed a pronounced hotspot damage in the root,iiiwhich was believed being caused by the forced displacement the BSexerted on the pipe seeing that both the pipe and the BS were modeledin the same nodal system. This was tried solved with a contactmodel, M 3 X, where the BS and the pipe were modeled in independentnodal systems with the contact element, CONT 130. M 3 Xproved itself difficult to converge. In the end a separate load historywas applied to M 3 X and in addition to M 3 to demonstrate this loadhistory also had the same tendencies as witnessed earlier. It wasconfirmed that the element type ITCODE 0 has the same issues fora dependent and an independent nodal system, and it was thereforeconcluded that this element model must be revised in the future ifit should be applied in similar fatigue assessments. The use of hang-off angle and full representation of the BS paves theway for a less conservative fatigue assessment than the stub model. The biggest damage found {{along the length of the}} BS is 51 % lessthan what is predicted from the stub model. However, it must benoted that the too stiff BS could have lead to less motion over itslength since the pipe will get a hinge-like transition over the BS-tipfor the upper threshold of wave responses. Even so, it is reasonableto believe that result for a correctly modeled BS will still give alower estimated damage than what is found in the stub model. Theconclusion is that the hang-off angle approach together with the ITCODE 31 element is an interesting path to pursue. In addition, thestub model approach could always be conducted as a supportingmodel because of its fast solution time. As such, the already establishedmethod does not necessarily need to be abandoned. </p...|$|E
