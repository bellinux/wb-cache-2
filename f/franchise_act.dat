In 1918, across the United Kingdom, women over the age of 30 gained the right to vote, followed by the Representation of the People (Equal <b>Franchise)</b> <b>Act</b> 1928 which saw women gain the same rights to vote as men.|$|E
25|$|The six {{majority}} judges {{decided that}} section 41 {{was indeed a}} transitional provision, which only operated as a restraint on the first law that the Parliament of Australia passed concerning the federal franchise, the Commonwealth <b>Franchise</b> <b>Act</b> 1902. That is, section 41 only protected rights which were in existence before the <b>Franchise</b> <b>Act</b> was passed. No new rights protectable by section 41 could be acquired after that time. Because the four people in this case did not acquire their right to vote in state elections until well after 1902, section 41 did not give them a right to vote in federal elections.|$|E
25|$|Thus, their {{argument}} was that only rights existing before {{the passing of}} the Commonwealth <b>Franchise</b> <b>Act</b> 1902 (the first federal law to deal with the federal franchise) would be protected by section 41.|$|E

This legislation also allowed women to run for government, making Australia the first in the world to allow this. In 1906 Finland became the next nation in the world to give all adult citizens full suffrage, in other words the right to vote and to run for office. New Zealand granted all adult citizens the right to vote (in 1893), but women did not get the right to run for the New Zealand legislature until 1919.|$|E
25|$|The first {{election}} for the Parliament {{of the newly}} formed Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 {{was based on the}} electoral provisions of the six pre-existing colonies, so that women who had the vote and the right to stand for Parliament at state level had the same rights for the 1901 Australian Federal election. In 1902, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Commonwealth <b>Franchise</b> <b>Act,</b> which enabled all women to vote and stand for {{election for}} the Federal Parliament. Four women stood for election in 1903. The Act did, however, specifically exclude 'natives' from Commonwealth franchise unless already enrolled in a state. In 1949, the right to vote in federal elections was extended to all Indigenous people who had served in the armed forces, or were enrolled to vote in state elections (Queensland, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory still excluded indigenous women from voting rights). Remaining restrictions were abolished in 1962 by the Commonwealth Electoral Act.|$|E

In 1928 the Representation of the People (Equal <b>Franchise)</b> <b>Act</b> lowered the voting age for women to 21 to put them on equal terms with male voters.|$|E

Her advance was noted with approval by Beatrice Webb, who saw in her a future candidate for high office—ahead of more senior Labour women such as Margaret Bondfield and Susan Lawrence. A tireless campaigner for women's equality, she challenged the caricature of voteless younger women as 'flappers'. On 29 March 1928 Wilkinson voted in the House of Commons for the bill that became the Representation of the People (Equal <b>Franchise)</b> <b>Act</b> 1928, granting the vote to all women aged 21 or over. During the debate she said: [...] "e are doing at last a great act of justice to the women of the country... just as we have [...] {{opened the door to the}} older women, tonight we are opening it to those who are just entering on the threshold of life and in whose hands is the new life of the future country that we are going to build".|$|E

The following election and gave Labour the most {{seats in the house}} to date. The electoral reforms also allowed women to run for Parliament. Christabel Pankhurst narrowly failed to win a seat in 1918, but in 1919 and 1920, both Lady Astor and Margaret Wintringham won seats for the Conservatives and Liberals respectively by succeeding their husband's seats. Labour swept to power in 1924. [...] Constance Markievicz (Sinn Féin) was the first woman elected in Ireland in 1918, but as an Irish nationalist, refused to take her seat. Astor's proposal to form a women's party in 1929 was unsuccessful, which some historians feel was a missed opportunity, as there were only 12 women in Parliament by 1940. Women gained considerable electoral experience {{over the next few years}} as a series of minority governments ensured almost annual elections. Close affiliation with Labour also proved to be a problem for the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (NUSEC), which had little support in the Conservative party.
