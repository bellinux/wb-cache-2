Subjects {{were exposed to}} vertical hand-transmitted 100 Hz continuous vibration and various repetitive shocks of equal energy content formed from one complete cycle of a 100 Hz sine wave. The repetition rate of the cycles was 5, 25, 50, or 100 s - 1 while the root-mean-square (rms) acceleration measured over exposures of five minutes was held constant at 2. 5, 5, or 10 ms - 2 rms (weighted according to Bristish Standard (BS) 6842 and International Standard (ISO) 5349). A control condition with no vibration was also included. Subjects held a handle with 10 % of their maximum hand grip force. When exposed to five shocks per second {{at each of the}} three <b>frequency-weighted</b> acceleration magnitudes the subjects developed a small TTS. Exposed to 100 shocks per second (continuous vibration) at each of the three <b>frequency-weighted</b> acceleration magnitudes caused a large TTS, although the total <b>frequency-weighted</b> energy was the same as when exposed to five shocks per second.

We show that the <b>frequency-weighted</b> sum rule for the intensity of the line is not given simply in terms of the pseudopotentials that describe the interactions between low-energy atoms. The origin of the departures from the simple pseudopotential result for the <b>frequency-weighted</b> sum rule is traced to what we refer to as incoherent contributions to the spectral weight. These arise from more complicated final states of the many-body system than the ones usually considered. In particular, we show how the relevant response function may be treated {{in a manner similar to}} the density-density response function for Fermi liquids, and express it as a coherent part coming from single particle-hole pairs, and an incoherent part coming from other excitations. We argue that in experiments only the coherent part of the response of the system is observed, and its contribution to the <b>frequency-weighted</b> sum rule is shown to be given correctly by the pseudopotential approximation.
