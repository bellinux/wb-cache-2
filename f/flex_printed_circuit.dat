40|$|An ALPIDE- 1 {{monolithic}} silicon {{pixel sensor}} prototype has been laser soldered to a <b>flex</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> using a novel interconnection technique using lasers. This technique {{is to be}} optimised to ensure stable, good quality connections between the sensor chips and the FPCs. To test the long-term stability of the connections, as well as study the effects on hit thresholds and noise in the sensor, it was thermally cycled in a climate chamber 1200 times. The soldered connections showed good qualities like even melting and good adhesion on pad/flex surfaces, and the chip remained in working condition for 1080 cycles. After this, a few connections failed, having cracks in the soldering tin, rendering the chip unusable. Threshold and noise characteristics seemed stable, except for the noise levels of sector 2 in the chip, for 1000 cycles in a temperature interval of " 10 ^∘" and " 50 ^∘" C. Still, further testing with wider temperature ranges and more cycles is needed to test {{the limitations of the}} chip...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the manufacturing of a flexible 192 -elements curvilinear CMUT array developed using our patented reverse fabrication process. In this process the silicon nitride CMUT membranes are surface micromachined over a silicon substrate {{such that the}} non-radiating surface of the transducer corresponds to the last layer deposited, while the radiating membranes are uncovered by completely etching the silicon substrate. Before {{the removal of the}} silicon substrate a flexible backing material is poured and cured on the non-radiating surface, and after the removal another layer of flexible suited material is applied to cover the membranes. At {{the end of the process}} the large 24 -mm by 6 -mm CMUT die with a total thickness of just 6. 5 mum, embedded in the flexible backing and coating layers, was bent to a radius of curvature of less than 10 mm in an azimuth direction, showing great flexibility. The functionality of the device wire-bonded to a <b>flex</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> and mounted on a curved backing with a radius of curvature of 25 mm was demonstrated by means of electrical impedance tests and pulse-echo measurements in water.

40|$|In {{the second}} long shut {{down of the}} LHC at CERN {{scheduled}} in 2018 - 19 a big upgrade of the ITS of the ALICE detector is planned. In light of this we discuss what the current state is of {{our view of the}} Standard Model, how Quantum Chromodynamics plays a role in it and how the gaps that are still left open can be answered by the study of Quark Gluon Plasma. When the goals in this theoretical view are set we discuss which of these are of interest to the ALICE collaboration, what the current performance and limitation are of the ALICE detector and how the ITS upgrade is going improve the current performance. Among many key aspects of the ITS is the pixel sensor system the most important and for this upgrade the new Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor architecture ALPIDE is chosen because of its best fit with the requirements set by the ALICE collaboration. One of the chips that is used to explore electrical and mechanical testing possibilities is the pALPIDEv 2 chip. This chip is embedded on a <b>flex</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> for which we developed a cable to connect it with a MOSAIC board. Furthermore was a power grid developed to connect it with a 5 V power supply. After connection was made the chip was tested on several important qualities that not only determined how well the tested chip matches the requirements of the ALICE collaboration but also explores the possibilities of future tests. The chip has four distinct pixel areas which are compared on their thresholds, noise and faulty pixels. By extracting the data with a C++ written program further statistical analysis could be performed after developing applicable Root programs. After showing significant differences in threshold, noise and faulty pixels this paper leaves {{a lot of room for}} further research i. e. testing this chip or upcoming versions of the ALPIDE-chip in an array...|$|E

50|$|When Sarmanian {{launched}} the company, most computer and electronics manufacturers were fabricating their own boards.

Likewise, computer and electronics manufacturers became more comfortable using suppliers for key electronic components, including <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> boards. Reductions in time to market, engineering/prototyping costs, and manufacturing ramp-up costs were being demonstrated by these suppliers to win business. In 1979, 40% of all rigid <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board fabrication was being outsourced to suppliers like PCC. By 1989, that figure was about 60%, and by 1995, 80%.
