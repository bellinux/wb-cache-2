5|$|James Whale (22 July 1889– 29 May 1957) was an English film {{director}}, theater {{director and}} actor. He is best remembered for his four classic horror films: Frankenstein (1931), The Old <b>Dark</b> <b>House</b> (1932), The Invisible Man (1933) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935). Whale also directed films in other genres, including {{what is considered}} the definitive film version of the musical Show Boat (1936). He became increasingly disenchanted with his association with horror, but many of his non-horror films have fallen into obscurity.|$|E
5|$|The pre-Code horror cycle was {{motivated}} by financial necessity. Universal in particular buoyed itself with the production of horror hits such as Dracula (1931) and Frankenstein, then followed those successes up with Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932), The Mummy (1932), and The Old <b>Dark</b> <b>House</b> (1932). Other major studios responded with their own productions. Much like the crime film cycle, however, the intense boom of the horror cycle was ephemeral, and had fallen off {{at the box office}} {{by the end of the}} pre-Code era.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{report that}} Bela Lugosi and Claude Rains were considered, {{with varying degrees}} of seriousness, for the role of Frankenstein's mentor, Pretorius; others report that the role was created {{specifically}} for Ernest Thesiger. Because of Mae Clarke's ill health, Valerie Hobson replaced her as Henry Frankenstein's love interest, Elizabeth. Early in production, Whale decided that the same actress cast to play the Bride should also play Mary Shelley in the film's prologue, to represent how the story— and horror in general— springs from {{the dark side of the}} imagination. He considered Brigitte Helm and Phyllis Brooks before deciding on Elsa Lanchester. Lanchester, who had accompanied husband Charles Laughton to Hollywood, had met with only moderate success while Laughton had made a strong impact with several films including The Private Life of Henry VIII (for which he had won an Oscar) and Whale's own The Old <b>Dark</b> <b>House.</b> Lanchester had returned alone to London when Whale contacted her to offer her the dual role. Lanchester modeled the Bride's hissing on the hissing of swans. She gave herself a sore throat while filming the hissing sequence, which Whale shot from multiple angles.|$|E

In the film It (2017), it is used as background music throughout the film, when the shape shifting antagonist is near.|$|E
25|$|Film {{versions}} soon followed, {{including a}} 1925 adaptation of The Monster and multiple adaptations of The Cat and the Canary and The Gorilla. By the late 1920s, the mysteries' popularity was declining in live theater; however, the genre continued in {{films such as}} James Whale's The Old <b>Dark</b> <b>House</b> (1932) and several adaptations of The Bat.|$|E
25|$|Gloria Frances Stuart (born Gloria Stewart, July 4, 1910 – September 26, 2010) was an American {{film and}} stage actress, visual artist, and activist. A native of Southern California, {{she began her}} acting {{in high school in}} the 1920s and on the stage in the 1930s and 1940s, {{performing}} in little theater and summer stock in Los Angeles and New York City. She signed a contract with Universal Pictures in 1932, and acted in numerous films for the studio, including The Old <b>Dark</b> <b>House</b> (1932), The Invisible Man (1933), and The Three Musketeers (1939).|$|E

25|$|Addams drew {{more than}} 1,300 {{cartoons}} {{over the course}} of his life. Those that did not appear in The New Yorker were often in Collier's and TV Guide. In 1961, Addams received, from the Mystery Writers of America, a Special Edgar Award for his body of work. His cartoons appeared in books, calendars, and other merchandising. Singer-guitarist Dean Gitter's 1957 recording Ghost Ballads, an album of folk songs with supernatural themes, was packaged with cover art by Addams showing a haunted house. The films The Old <b>Dark</b> <b>House</b> (1963) and Murder by Death (1976) feature title sequences illustrated by Addams.|$|E
500|$|Next from Whale were The Impatient Maiden and The Old <b>Dark</b> <b>House</b> (both 1932). The Impatient Maiden {{made little}} {{impression}} but The Old <b>Dark</b> <b>House</b> {{is credited with}} reinventing the [...] "dark house" [...] subgenre of horror films. Thought lost for some years, a print was found by filmmaker Curtis Harrington in the Universal vaults in 1968 and restored by George Eastman House.|$|E
500|$|Although not {{the first}} film set in a {{supposed}} haunted house, The Cat and the Canary started the pattern for the [...] "old dark house" [...] genre. The term is derived from English director James Whale's The Old <b>Dark</b> <b>House</b> (1932), which was heavily influenced by Leni's film, and refers to [...] "films in which murders are committed by masked killers in old mansions." [...] Supernatural events in the film are all explained at the film's conclusion {{as the work of}} a criminal. Other films in this genre influenced by The Cat and the Canary include The Last Warning, House on Haunted Hill (1959), and the monster films of Abbott and Costello and Laurel and Hardy.|$|E

500|$|Morrissey {{returned}} to the stage in 2008 for a run of Neil LaBute's In a Dark <b>Dark</b> <b>House</b> and played the title role in the Liverpool Everyman's production of Macbeth in 2011. He then starred in the British crime film Blitz, playing a morally dubious reporter {{in contact with the}} eponymous cop killer. The following year, he portrayed the Governor in AMC television series The Walking Dead as a series regular in the third and fourth seasons and the fifth season in a guest role. The British Film Institute describes Morrissey as being considered [...] "one of the most versatile English actors of his generation", and he is noted for his meticulous preparation for and research into the roles he plays.|$|E
500|$|From November 2008 to January 2009, Morrissey {{returned}} to the theatre {{for the first time}} in nine years to appear in the Almeida Theatre's British premiere of Neil LaBute's In a Dark <b>Dark</b> <b>House.</b> He played Terry, one of two brothers who had been abused as a child, opposite Steven Mackintosh and Kira Sternbach. He took the role because he liked LaBute's previous play, The Mercy Seat (2002). After accepting the part, he researched the character by reading case studies of adults who were abused when they were children. He learned about how they coped with the shame of their abuse, and incorporated those feelings into his acting. He was also able to consult LaBute during rehearsals but avoided asking him exactly how to play Terry. In a Daily Telegraph review that criticised the play, Charles Spencer wrote that Morrissey's was the best performance [...] "as the blue-collar older brother who reveals extraordinary depths of grief, damage and forgiveness that finally light up this dark, flawed play." [...] Benedict Nightingale of The Times initially believed that Morrissey's acting was [...] "a bit stiff, almost as if he was waiting for his cues rather than reacting instantaneously to their content" [...] but found him more impressive as the play went on.|$|E

2500|$|In 1933 after {{completing}} The Old <b>Dark</b> <b>House,</b> Stuart {{was one of}} the first stars to work toward an actors’ union and was one of thirty-nine new Class A members of the Screen Actors Guild, of which she was a founding member. In June, 1936, she helped Paul Muni, Franchot Tone, Ernst Lubitsch, and Oscar Hammerstein II form the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League. [...] That same year she and writer Dorothy Parker helped create the League to Support the Spanish Civil War Orphans.|$|E

2500|$|Stuart's career {{advanced}} when English director James Whale chose her for {{the glamour}} role as a sentimental wife who winds up stranded among strangers at a spooky mansion in his ensemble cast (Boris Karloff, Melvyn Douglas, Charles Laughton, Lilian Bond, Ernest Thesiger, Eva Moore and Raymond Massey) for The Old <b>Dark</b> <b>House</b> (1932). The film was critically praised, and The New York Times called Stuart's performance [...] "clever and charming," [...] with the movie later becoming a cult classic. Stuart's experience filming The Old <b>Dark</b> <b>House</b> also became integral {{to the formation of}} the Screen Actors Guild in 1933: [...] "James [...] joined all the English actors,” Stuart recalled. “So {{on one side of the}} set they had their ‘elevensies’ and `foursies,’ and Melvyn [...] and I would be sitting together, not invited. One day, Melvyn said to me, `Are you interested in forming a union together?’ I said, ‘What’s a union?’ He said, ‘Like in New York – Actor’s Equity. The actors get together and work for better working conditions.’ I said, ‘Oh wonderful,’ because I was getting up at five every morning; in makeup at seven, in hair at eight, wardrobe at quarter of nine, and then sometimes if production wanted you to, you worked until four or five the next morning. There was no overtime. They fed us when they felt like it, when it was convenient for production. It was really very, very hard work." [...] After filming completed, Stuart began canvassing, and was one of the union's first founding members.|$|E
2500|$|Film writer Richard Corliss {{describes}} Sunset Boulevard as [...] "the definitive Hollywood horror movie", {{noting that}} almost {{everything in the}} script is [...] "ghoulish". He remarks that the story is narrated by a dead man whom Norma Desmond first mistakes for an undertaker, {{while most of the}} film takes place [...] "in an old, <b>dark</b> <b>house</b> that only opens its doors to the living dead". He compares von Stroheim's character Max with the concealed Erik, the eponymous central character in The Phantom of the Opera, and Norma Desmond with Dracula, noting that, as she seduces Joe Gillis, the camera tactfully withdraws with [...] "the traditional directorial attitude taken towards Dracula's jugular seductions". He writes that the narrative contains an excess of [...] "cheap sarcasm", but ultimately congratulates the writers for attributing this dialogue to Joe Gillis, who was in any case presented {{as little more than a}} hack writer.|$|E
2500|$|Stuart {{was given}} her first co-starring role by {{director}} John Ford in her next film, Air Mail, playing opposite Pat O'Brien and Ralph Bellamy. Of her {{performance in the}} movie, the New York Times Mordaunt Hall wrote, [...] "Gloria Stuart, who does so well in The Old <b>Dark</b> <b>House,</b> a picture now at the Rialto, makes {{the most of the}} part of the girl..." [...] That two Gloria Stuart movies were in theaters simultaneously became the rule rather than the exception in her early career. In 1932, her first year, Stuart had four films released, then nine in 1933, six in 1934. In 1935, Stuart was having a baby, so only four movies were released. Six movies followed in 1936. After Air Mail, Mordaunt Hall's notices for Gloria Stuart came down to a few words. Laughter in Hell: [...] "Gloria Stuart appears as Lorraine..."; [...] Sweepings: [...] "...played by the comely Gloria Stuart..."; Private Jones: [...] "Gloria Stuart is charming..." ...|$|E

Another successful stage imitator was The Monster, a play by Crane Wilbur that opened on Broadway in August 1922. Ralph Spence's 1925 play The Gorilla was a parody of the genre; its advertisements claimed it [...] "outbats [...] ".|$|R
