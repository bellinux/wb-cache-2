5|$|The Southeast Asian {{cultural}} <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> {{also evident}} in Malagasy cuisine, in which rice is consumed at every meal, typically accompanied by one {{of a variety of}} flavorful vegetable or meat dishes. African <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their owner's wealth, traditions originating on the African mainland. Cattle rustling, originally a rite of passage for young men in the plains areas of Madagascar where the largest herds of cattle are kept, has become a dangerous and sometimes deadly criminal enterprise as herdsmen in the southwest attempt to defend their cattle with traditional spears against increasingly armed professional rustlers.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} early days of Sicilian Baroque, the first {{buildings}} of the new neoclassical era were often copies or hybrids of the two styles. The Palazzo Ducezio (Illustration 19) was begun in 1746, and the ground floor with arcades creating play of light and shadow is pure Baroque. However, when a few years later the upper floor was added, despite the use of Baroque broken pediments above the windows, the neoclassical French <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> very pronounced, highlighted by the central curved bay. The Sicilian Baroque was gradually and slowly being superseded by French neoclassicism.|$|E
50|$|Peter's main <b>influences</b> <b>were</b> Le Corbusier and Berthold Lubetkin. Other <b>influences</b> <b>were</b> {{though his}} friendships with Austin Wright, Kenneth Rowntree and Diana Rowntree, Dennis Flanders and others.|$|R
25|$|Dominican {{culture is}} a mixture of Taino Amerindian, Spanish European, and West African origins. While Taino <b>influences</b> <b>are</b> present in many Dominican traditions, the European and West African <b>influences</b> <b>are</b> the most noticeable.|$|R
50|$|On {{a general}} level, the {{military}} of Argentina <b>was</b> <b>influenced</b> by the German military, but this <b>influence</b> <b>was</b> dated from decades before {{the rise of}} Nazism. This <b>influence</b> <b>was</b> also limited to the military topics, and {{did not include the}} ideas of political organization.|$|R
5|$|Between 1841 and 1846, he {{published}} Beniowski, {{considered by some}} his best lyrical poetry. Starting as {{a story of a}} historical figure, it developed into a discussion of the poet's own life and opinions. In 1842 he joined the religious-philosophical group, Koło Sprawy Bożej (Circle of God's Cause), led by Andrzej Towiański. This group included, among others, Mickiewicz. Towiański's <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> credited with a new, mystical current in Słowacki's works, seen in works such as the poem Beniowski and the drama Ksiądz Marek (Father Mark). Słowacki left the Circle a year later, in 1843.|$|E
5|$|Black {{returns to}} Seattle, researching Gehenna Industries from his home. He uncovers a {{warehouse}} address {{belonging to the}} cult, which Atkins investigates. The warehouse is full of cached weaponry, stockpiled for the cult's doomsday predictions. The cult's leader lures Atkins into the industrial microwave which {{has been used to}} immolate the victims, but the police arrive in time to save him, having been tipped off by Black that Atkins may be in danger. The weapons stockpile allows the police to bring down the cult, but Black is certain that their <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> still a threat.|$|E
5|$|Both Lalli (Laurentius) and Kerttu (Gertrud) are {{originally}} German names, {{which might}} {{indicate that the}} poem was partly constructed on foreign models, whose <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> visible in other aspects, too. The way Lalli is manipulated to commit the crime {{and what happens to}} him later seem to be taken from a medieval Judas fable. Extensive borrowing from unrelated Finnish legends from the pre-Christian era has taken place as well, leaving quite little original material left at all.|$|E
50|$|Calero {{began her}} art career {{when she was}} thirty years old. Her major <b>influences</b> <b>were</b> the artists of the surrealism {{movement}} and Mexican muralism. She stated {{that one of her}} biggest <b>influences</b> <b>was</b> the work of Jesús Guerrero Galván.|$|R

50|$|At Bound for Glory, Bad <b>Influence</b> <b>were</b> {{defeated}} by Eric Young and Joseph Park in a Gauntlet match. After being eliminated, both attacked Park {{and made him}} bleed. The same night, Abyss appeared and attacked Bad Influence. On December 12, 2013, Bad <b>Influence</b> <b>were</b> {{defeated by}} Parks and Eric Young when Young made Park bleed. On December 26, 2013, Bad <b>Influence</b> <b>were</b> defeated again by Park in a Monster's Ball match. On March 2, 2014, Bad <b>Influence</b> <b>were</b> {{part of a group}} of TNA wrestlers that took part in Wrestle-1's Kaisen: Outbreak event in Tokyo, Japan, defeating Junior Stars (Koji Kanemoto and Minoru Tanaka) in a tag team match. On April 23, 2014, Daniels announced his departure from TNA.|$|R
5|$|Chopin's <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> {{marked in}} the first two pieces. Orledge observes that the {{right-hand}} figuration at the end of No 1 is remarkably similar to {{that at the end of}} Chopin's Waltz in E minor. In No 2 Nectoux detects the additional influence of Liszt (Au bord d'une source) in the opening bars. In the closing bars of No 2, Orledge finds a resemblance to the end of Chopin's Grande Valse Brillante, Op, 18.|$|E
5|$|Déby faces armed {{opposition}} from {{groups who are}} deeply divided by leadership clashes but united in their intention to overthrow him. These forces stormed the capital on 13 April 2006, but were ultimately repelled. Chad's greatest foreign <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> France, which maintains 1,000 soldiers in the country. Déby relies on the French to help repel the rebels, and France gives the Chadian army logistical and intelligence support for fear of a complete collapse of regional stability. Nevertheless, Franco-Chadian relations were soured by the granting of oil drilling rights to the American Exxon company in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, first {{published}} in 1781 and presented again with major revisions in 1787, represents a significant intervention into what will later {{become known as the}} philosophy of mind. Kant's first critique is generally recognized as among the most significant works of modern philosophy in the West. Kant is a figure whose <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> marked in both continental and analytic/Anglo-American philosophy. Kant's work develops an in-depth study of transcendental consciousness, or {{the life of the mind}} as conceived through universal categories of consciousness.|$|E
40|$|Peer <b>influences</b> <b>are</b> {{among the}} most {{powerful}} correlates of adolescent problem behavior. Using a sibling sample and hierarchical linear modeling to control for shared influences on behavior, the role was examined of nonshared parent and peer influences as prospective predictors of adolescent cigarette smoking onset. These results were compared to results from a subsample of nonsiblings. Peer <b>influences</b> <b>were</b> significant predictors of smoking onset when shared <b>influences</b> <b>were</b> controlled, suggesting that peer group characteristics operate, at least partially, as nonshared influences. Furthermore, nonshared peer <b>influences</b> <b>were</b> stronger in more educated families than in less educated families. Results highlight the potential utility of controlling for shared influences, and support the importance of {{taking into account the}} broader social context...|$|R
50|$|ONE OK ROCK's basic <b>influences</b> <b>are</b> Linkin Park, Foo Fighters, Good Charlotte, and Ellegarden. The group's initial idea {{began when}} Toru {{wanted to start}} a rock band and invited Ryota to join him. Good Charlotte <b>influences</b> <b>are</b> seen on their first album.|$|R
50|$|European <b>influences</b> <b>are</b> {{strongest in}} the {{northern}} parts of the continent while indigenous and African <b>influences</b> <b>are</b> relatively stronger in the south. Because {{of the history of}} colonialism, most North Americans speak English, Spanish or French and societies and states commonly reflect Western traditions.|$|R
5|$|In Valparaíso, {{they created}} their {{largest and most}} {{important}} colony, bringing with them neighbourhoods of British character, schools, social clubs, sports clubs, business organisations and periodicals. Even today their <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> apparent in specific areas, such as the banks and the navy, {{as well as in}} certain social activities, such as football, horse racing, and the custom of drinking tea.|$|E
5|$|Located at 800 Southeast 10thAvenue, the {{building}} occupies the west {{half of the}} block between Southeast Belmont and Southeast Morrison streets. The southwest corner entry features a stylized Egyptian temple of cast stone. Italianate Renaissance <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> seen in the ground floor's large arched windows and tall narrow windows on the second. The west facade is lined with banks of large windows that helped illuminate and cool the work areas. Other important exterior features include a large garage door along Belmont Street, and a paved parking lot and water-tower pedestal on the Morrison Street side.|$|E
5|$|Office of Strategic <b>Influence</b> <b>is</b> {{the first}} album by American {{progressive}} rock band OSI, released by InsideOut Music on February 18, 2003. The album {{was recorded in}} June 2002 and mixed in August 2002 at the Carriage House Studios in Stamford, Connecticut.|$|E

2500|$|Tan {{draws from}} a large source of {{inspiration}} and cites many influences on his work. His comment on the subject is: [...] "I’m pretty omnivorous {{when it comes to}} influences, and I like to admit this openly." [...] Some <b>influences</b> <b>are</b> very direct. The Lost Thing is a strong example where Tan makes visual references to famous artworks. Many of his <b>influences</b> <b>are</b> a lot more subtle visually, some of the <b>influences</b> <b>are</b> ideological. Below <b>are</b> some <b>influences</b> he has named in various interviews: ...|$|R
50|$|The band's primary <b>influence</b> <b>was</b> Damnation A.D.|$|R
5|$|Scott's <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> felt {{throughout}} the novel. Lengthy {{descriptions of the}} countryside are interrupted constantly by tangents explaining the history of Brittany and its people. The pastoral setting is integrated into the plot, particularly the guerrilla combat of the Chouans. In complementing individual with environs Balzac also shows the influence of James Fenimore Cooper, whose The Last of the Mohicans had impressed the French author. Like the Mahicans of Cooper's novel, the Chouan insurgents are skilled at using their surroundings, {{coming out of the}} woods in more ways than one.|$|E
5|$|Shots in {{the film}} were drawn {{directly}} from panels in the graphic novel, illustrated by Richard Piers Rayner. An instance of the direct <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> the scene in which Michael Jr. {{looks up at the}} Chicago skyline from the vehicle, with the skyline reflected in the vehicle's glass.|$|E
5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical building. Its rooflines, main entrance, and the placement and style of the windows are all asymmetrical in nature, {{a hallmark of the}} Arts and Crafts style. Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to the Arts and Crafts movement. This <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> seen most prominently on the building's interior.|$|E
50|$|Philosophical <b>influences</b> <b>are</b> {{not wrong}} in themselves.|$|R

5|$|The {{point at}} which the Solar System ends and {{interstellar}} space begins is not precisely defined because its outer boundaries are shaped by two separate forces: the solar wind and the Sun's gravity. The limit of the solar wind's <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> roughly four times Pluto's distance from the Sun; this heliopause, the outer boundary of the heliosphere, is considered the beginning of the interstellar medium. The Sun's Hill sphere, the effective range of its gravitational dominance, is thought to extend up to a thousand times farther and encompasses the theorized Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|Zaculeu {{came under}} the {{influence}} of central Mexico again in the Late Classic. The architectural <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> so distinct that it suggests that a foreign Mexican elite may have settled at the city and continued in occupation there until the K'iche' conquered the site in the Postclassic.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{during the}} early English Renaissance was far less formal than that of {{mainland}} Europe and drew from a greater selection of motifs both ancient and modern, with less emphasis placed on the strict observance of rules derived from antique architecture. This {{has led to an}} argument that the style was an evolution of Gothic rather than an innovation imported from Europe. This argument is evident at Montacute, where Gothic pinnacles, albeit obelisk in form, are combined with Renaissance gables, pediments, classical statuary, ogee roofs and windows appearing as bands of glass. This profusion of large, mullioned windows, an innovation of their day, give the appearance that the principal façade is built entirely of glass; a similar fenestration was employed at Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire. However, despite the Dutch gables, a feature of the English Renaissance acquired as the style spread from France across the Low Countries to England, and the Gothic elements, much of the architectural <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> Italian.|$|E
