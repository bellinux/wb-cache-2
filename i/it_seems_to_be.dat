5|$|Arabic astronomical {{contributions}} include Albatenius' {{discovery that}} {{the direction of}} the Sun's apogee (the place in the Sun's orbit against the fixed stars where <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moving slowest) is changing. (In modern heliocentric terms, this is caused by a gradual motion of the aphelion of the Earth's orbit). Ibn Yunus observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun's position for many years using a large astrolabe.|$|E
5|$|This classically {{designed}} wing {{has been}} attributed to Inigo Jones, but without supporting evidence; as with a similar attribution at Brympton d'Evercy, also in Somerset, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> based solely on the alternating segmental and pointed pediments over the groundfloor windows, and ignoring the irregularities in their spacings and placings, which Jones is unlikely to have countenanced.|$|E
5|$|Panpsychism is {{the view}} that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of {{experience}} or point of view. Superficially, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a form of property dualism, since it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say mechanical behaviour is derived from primitive mentality of atoms and molecules—as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to {{the presence or absence}} of complex structure in a compound object. So long as the reduction of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not a (strong) form of property dualism; otherwise it is.|$|E

5|$|Another form of {{acoustic}} communication is the headslap. This typically starts with an {{animal in the}} water elevating its snout and remaining stationary. After some time, the jaws are opened sharply then clamped shut with a biting motion that makes a loud slapping sound, and this is immediately followed by a loud splash, after which the head may be submerged and copious bubbles produced. Some species then roar, while others slap the water with their tails. Episodes of headslapping spread through the group. The purpose varies, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with maintaining social relationships, and is also used in courtship. Dominant individuals may also display their body size while swimming at the water surface, and a subordinate will submit by holding its head at an acute angle with the jaws open before retreating underwater.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by fluoroscopy and feedback from the patient, and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath {{the skin of the}} upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they are attached to the snugly fitting generator. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than nociceptive pain, but current evidence is too weak to recommend its use in the treatment of cancer pain.|$|E
5|$|In the Life of Probus, {{the author}} 'Flavius Vopiscus of Syracuse' {{states that the}} Emperor's {{descendants}} (posteri) fled from Rome and settled near Verona. There a statue of Probus was struck by lightning, a portent according to soothsayers 'that future generations of the family would rise to such distinction in the senate they all would hold the highest posts', though Vopiscus (supposedly writing under Constantine) says this prophecy has not yet come to pass. This {{is one of the}} strongest indications of the History's late 4th-century date, as <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a fairly transparent allusion to the rich and powerful senator Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus (consul in 371) whose two sons held the consulship together in 395. Petronius Probus was born in Verona.|$|E

5|$|The Gospel of the Hebrews is {{the only}} Jewish–Christian gospel which the Church Fathers refer to by name. The {{language}} of composition {{is thought to be}} Greek. The provenance has been associated with Egypt; it probably began circulating in Alexandria, Egypt in {{the first decades of the}} 2nd century and was used by Greek-speaking Jewish–Christian communities there. The communities to which they belonged were traditional, conservative Christians who followed the teaching of the primitive Christian church in Jerusalem, integrating their understanding of Jesus with strict observance of Jewish customs and law, which they regarded as essential to salvation. Despite this, the gospel displays no connection with other Jewish–Christian literature, nor does it appear to be based on the Gospel of Matthew or the other canonical gospels of what is now orthodox Christianity. Instead, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken from alternative oral forms of the same underlying traditions. Some of the fragments suggest a syncretic gnostic influence, while others support close ties to traditional Jewish Wisdom literature.|$|E
5|$|The toxins in A.muscaria are water-soluble. When sliced thinly, or {{finely diced}} and boiled in {{plentiful}} water until thoroughly cooked, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> detoxified. Although its consumption {{as a food}} has never been widespread, the consumption of detoxified A.muscaria has been practiced {{in some parts of}} Europe (notably by Russian settlers in Siberia) since at least the 19th century, and likely earlier. The German physician and naturalist Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff wrote the earliest published account on how to detoxify this mushroom in 1823. In the late 19th century, the French physician Félix Archimède Pouchet was a populariser and advocate of A.muscaria consumption, comparing it to manioc, an important food source in tropical South America that must be detoxified before consumption.|$|E
5|$|Amazing {{began as}} a bedsheet format {{magazine}} and remained so until October 1933, when it switched to pulp size. With the April–May 1953 issue Amazing became a digest. Seven issues in the early 1980s, from November 1980 to November 1981, were a half-inch taller than the regular digest size, but thereafter the magazine reverted to the standard digest format. In May 1991 the magazine returned to a large format, but this lasted only until the Winter 1994 issue, and the next three issues were digest-sized again. When the magazine reappeared in 1998, it was in bedsheet format and remained that size until the very end. The last issue, March 2005, was distributed only as a PDF download, never as a physical magazine. The volume numbering contained some irregularities: the numbering given in the tables above {{appears to be in}} error for the period from 1979 to 1983, but in fact it is given correctly in the table. Note also that vol. 27 no. 8 was a single issue, not two, as <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> from the table; it was dated Dec 1953/Jan 1954.|$|E

25|$|The {{gospel of}} Peter was likely {{written in the}} first half of the 2nd century. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> largely legendary, hostile toward Jews, and {{including}} docetic elements. It had been lost but was rediscovered in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|While Greek {{astronomy}} probably influenced Indian learning, to {{the point}} of introducing trigonometry, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the case that Indian mathematics is otherwise an indigenous tradition; in particular, {{there is no evidence that}} Euclid's Elements reached India before the 18th century.|$|E

25|$|Australian naturalist William John Macleay {{described}} the sandyback stingaree in an 1884 issue of Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales, based on specimens collected near Port Jackson in New South Wales.

The yield of this reaction is moderate, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the most effective method of making the 1,4 substitution.|$|E

25|$|Sifre Zutta (The small Sifre). This {{work is a}} halakhic {{commentary}} on the book of Numbers. The text of this midrash is only partially preserved in medieval works, while other portions were discovered by Solomon Schechter in his research in the famed Cairo Geniza. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> older than most other midrash, coming from the early 3rd century.|$|E

25|$|The {{use of a}} seal by men {{of wealth}} and {{position}} was common before the Christian era, but high functionaries of the Church adopted the habit.
