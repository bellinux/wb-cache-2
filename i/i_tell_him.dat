Spears told MTV News that after she first listened to the song, she felt it was different and unlike anything she had heard before. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Spears spoke about Martin's productions on Femme Fatale, saying, [...] "Max played a huge role on this album {{and he has been}} there since the beginning so there is such a huge level of trust. He gets exactly what I am saying when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> what I want and don’t want musically". Spears recorded her vocals at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The track was later mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. It was registered on Broadcast Music Incorporated under the legal title [...] "In Love With a Criminal". On March 2, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account a link to a 17-second clip of the song, describing it as [...] "one of [...] favorites".|$|E

500|$|The horses {{who have}} served as Thunder {{have been trained to}} remain calm in {{situations}} that would normally cause a horse to respond with a fight-or-flight response, such as the flashing explosions of a pyrotechnic display, or items suddenly landing on the field including skydivers with parachutes and various objects thrown by spectators, or loud music and the sounds associated {{with tens of thousands of}} cheering fans at Mile High. Ann Judge has explained that because so many unexpected things can happen, it is important that the people working with him remain calm; it is trust in his rider and handlers, not just desensitization, that helps the horse remain steady: [...] "You want them to look to you for the appropriate response and for confidence and faith so that the flight response doesn’t get initiated." [...] She describes the process by saying, [...] "if something is fearful to him, as long as he looks to me, and <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> he’s OK, he’s OK." [...] The only frightening stimuli that was an ongoing problem for both Thunder Sr. and Thunder II was when the crowd would perform the wave; Thunder Sr. would stand still, but tremble. Thunder II would become tense, requiring ground handlers and his rider to help steady him. Thunder III is the first of the mascots to tolerate wearing earplugs, which help protect his hearing from loud noises during games.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1865, Whitman's friend, John Burroughs (1837–1921), an {{aspiring}} nature writer, had returned to Washington to his position at the Treasury department after a long vacation in the woods. Burroughs recalled that Whitman had been [...] "deeply interested in what <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> of the hermit thrush, {{and he says he}} largely used the information I have given him in one of his principal poems". Burroughs described the song as [...] "the finest sound in nature...perhaps more of an evening than a morning hymn...a voice of that calm, sweet solemnity one attains to in his best moments." [...] Whitman took copious notes of his conversations with Burroughs on the subject, writing of the hermit thrush that it [...] "sings oftener after sundown...is very secluded...likes shaded, dark places...His song is a hymn...in swamps—is very shy...never sings near the farm houses—never in the settlement—is the bird of the solemn primal woods & of Nature pure & holy." [...] Burroughs published an essay in May 1865 in which he described the hermit thrush as [...] "quite a rare bird, of very shy and secluded habits" [...] found [...] "only in the deepest and most remote forests, usually in damp and swampy localities". Loving notes that the hermit thrush was [...] "a common bird on Whitman's native Long Island" [...] Biographer Justin Kaplan draws a connection between Whitman's notes and the lines in the poem: ...|$|E
500|$|Until mid-1888, Foraker had the {{enthusiastic}} support of Hanna, who, while still boosting John Sherman for president, was a generous {{contributor to the}} governor's 1885 and 1887 campaigns. [...] Hanna hoped {{to be able to}} dispense patronage in northern Ohio. [...] According to Hanna biographer William T. Horner, however, [...] "unfortunately for Hanna, Foraker largely refused to grant Hanna the authority that by tradition he probably had earned." [...] One example, later cited by Foraker as a reason his close relationship with Hanna ended, was the question of the position of state oil inspector, whose substantial fees were paid, not by the taxpayer, but by the oil companies, and who was permitted to appoint large numbers of deputies. [...] In 1885, soon after Foraker's inauguration, Hanna advocated the appointment of William M. Bayne, while Congressman McKinley pressed the name of Edwin Hartshorn. [...] Hanna agreed to withdraw Bayne, not to accommodate McKinley, but to save Foraker from a difficulty. [...] Hanna wrote to Foraker, [...] "I had a call from Major McKinley and his oil inspector candidate. ... <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> he 'wants the earth'..." [...] However, Foraker instead reappointed the incumbent, Louis Smithnight. [...] One of the men appointed deputy oil inspector was Harry Smith, the black editor who had supported Foraker in the 1885 election. [...] McKinley again approached Foraker after his re-election in 1887 seeking Hartshorn's appointment; however, Foraker appointed George B. Cox, Republican boss of Cincinnati, as chief though Smithnight was retained as a deputy. [...] In later years, Foraker suggested the dispute over the oil inspectorship was a reason for Hanna breaking from him and allying with McKinley, stating after Hanna's death in 1904, [...] "I have often thought since that my appointment of Cox made McKinley president." ...|$|E
