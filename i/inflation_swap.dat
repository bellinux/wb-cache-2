40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{and estimates}} an equilibrium {{model of the}} term structures of nominal and real interest rates. The term structures are driven by state variables that include the short term real interest rate, expected inflation, a factor that models the changing level to which inflation is expected to revert, as well as four volatility factors that follow GARCH processes. We derive analytical solutions for the prices of nominal bonds, inflation-indexed bonds that have an indexation lag, the term structure of expected inflation, and <b>inflation</b> <b>swap</b> rates. The model parameters are estimated using data on nominal Treasury yields, survey forecasts of inflation, and <b>inflation</b> <b>swap</b> rates. We find that allowing for GARCH effects is particularly important for real interest rate and expected inflation processes, but that long–horizon real and inflation risk premia are relatively stable. Comparing our model prices of inflation-indexed bonds to those of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) suggests that TIPS were underpriced prior to 2004 but subsequently were valued fairly. We find that unexpected increases in both short run and longer run inflation implied by our model {{have a negative impact}} on stock market returns.

40|$|Estimates of {{the real}} term {{structure}} for the euro area implied by French index-linked bonds are obtained {{by means of a}} smoothing spline methodology. The real term structure allows computation of the constant-maturity inflation compensation, which is compared with the surveyed inflation expectations in order to obtain a rough measure of the inflation risk premium. The comparison between the inflation compensation and the <b>inflation</b> <b>swap</b> shows that the two variables are closely interlinked but differently affected by illiquidity during periods of stress. The methodology used in this paper is quite effective at capturing the general shape {{of the real}} term structure while smoothing through idiosyncratic variations in the yields of index-linked bonds. Real interest rates tend to be quite stable at longer horizons and the average 10 -year real rate from 2002 to 2009 is close to 2 per cent. Furthermore, evidence is found that inflation compensation was held down in the period 2008 - 09 by an increase in the liquidity premium of index-linked bonds. index-linked bond, real term structure, inflation compensation, inflation risk premium, smoothing spline...|$|E

30|$|Long-run {{inflation}} expectations {{should not}} respond to economic news if the central bank is seen as credibly committed to stabilising inflation. In this paper we find that since {{the onset of the}} global financial crisis, medium and long-term inflation expectations implied by <b>inflation</b> <b>swaps</b> in the euro area, United Kingdom and United States have become less responsive to actual inflation and changes in oil and food prices. This suggests that the credibility of the central banks in these economies remains intact, despite large increases in their balance sheets due to unconventional monetary policy measures and the introduction of explicit forward guidance at the zero lower bound. We also find an increase in autocorrelation of inflation expectations, which suggests that shocks have a longer-lasting impact than before the financial crisis.|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} the pricing and hedging of inflation-indexed swaps, and the pricing of inflation-indexed swaptions, and options on inflation-indexed bonds. To price the inflation-indexed swaps, we suggest an extended HJM model. The model allows both the forward {{rates and the}} consumer price index to be driven, not only by a standard multidimensional Wiener process but also by a general marked point process. Our model is an extension of the HJM approach proposed by Jarrow and Yildirim [Jarrow, R., Yildirim, Y., 2003. Pricing treasury inflation protected securities and related derivatives using an HJM model.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} the term structures of nominal and real interest rates driven by state variables representing the short-term real interest rate, expected inflation, inflation’s central tendency, and four volatility factors that follow GARCH processes. We derive analytical solutions for nominal bond yields, yields on inflation-indexed bonds that have an indexation lag, and the term structure of expected inflation. Unlike prior studies, the model’s parameters are estimated using data on <b>inflation</b> <b>swap</b> rates, as well as nominal yields and survey forecasts of inflation. The volatility state variables fully determine bonds’ time-varying risk premia and allow for stochastic volatility and correlation between bond yields, yet they have small effects on the cross section of nominal yields. Allowing for time-varying volatility is particularly important for real interest rate and expected inflation processes, but long-horizon real and inflation risk premia are relatively stable.

40|$|A {{substantial}} {{decline in}} market-based measures of inflation expectations has {{raised concerns about}} low future inflation. An important question to address is whether these measures contain information that can improve upon alternative forecasting methods. This analysis finds that market-based inflation forecasts generally are no more accurate than surveys of professional forecasters or simple forecast rules. This suggests that financial markets can provide little additional useful forward-looking information about inflation. Correction: This Letter has been revised to incorporate into the analysis the indexation lag of <b>inflation</b> <b>swap</b> contracts. Figure 2 has been revised accordingly. An Addendum describes the changes in detail and includes additional results. The changes reflect a somewhat revised conclusion that market-based surveys cannot improve upon {{some of the most}} common methods for predicting inflation. The Federal Reserve’s dual mandate requires monetary policy to aim for both maximum employment and price stability. Although employment has recovered since the recession, inflation has consistently remained below the Fed’s 2 % longer-run objective.

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} nature of {{deflation}} risk by extracting the objective distribution of inflation from the market prices of <b>inflation</b> <b>swaps</b> and options. We find that the market expects inflation to average about three {{percent over the next}} 30 years. Despite this, the market places substantial probability weight on deflation scenarios in which prices decline by more than 10 to 20 percent over extended horizons. We find that the market prices the economic tail risk of deflation similarly to other types of tail risks such as corporate default or catas-trophic insurance losses. In contrast, inflation tail risk generally has a smaller premium. Short-term deflation risk is significantly linked to measures of systemic financial risk while longer-term deflation risk is driven more by sovereign credit and macroeconomic factors...|$|R

40|$|While {{the market}} for Treasury inflation-protected {{securities}} (TIPS) has developed considerably over the past decade, {{the debate over whether}} their issuance benefits the U. S.

Information from <b>inflation</b> <b>swap</b> rates in conjunction with a joint model of yields for nominal non-inflation-protected Treasury bonds and TIPS provides evidence that, even under conservative assumptions, the TIPS inflation risk premium has been large enough in recent years to offset the liquidity disadvantage of the series. This suggests that overall the Treasury has benefited from issuing TIPS. Inflation-indexed debt securities provide bond investors with protection from inflation. They are distinct from regular debt securities in that the principal is adjusted according to changes in a given price index, thereby maintaining the purchasing power of the principal. They also include coupon payments, which reflect the compensation lenders require in addition to preservation of the purchasing power of the principal. From the standpoint of the issuer, if inflation remains positive, the primary motivation for offering inflation-indexed debt is that investors are willing to pay a premium for the protection from inflation these securities provide.

40|$|The {{second round}} of Federal Reserve {{large-scale}} asset purchases, from November 2010 to June 2011, included regular purchases of Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. An analysis of liquidity premiums indicates that {{the functioning of the}} TIPS market and the related <b>inflation</b> <b>swap</b> market improved both on the days the Fed purchased TIPS and {{over the course of the}} LSAP program. Thus, TIPS purchases had liquidity benefits beyond the effect they may have had in reducing Treasury yields. The success of the Fed’s large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) in reducing Treasury yields and mortgage rates seems well established. Several studies have found evidence that yields on longer-maturity Treasuries and other securities declined on days the Fed indicated it was planning to increase its holdings of longer-term securities (see Gagnon et al. 2011 and Hamilton and Wu 2011). Such announcements appear to influence market expectations about future monetary policy and are correlated with declines in risk premiums on longer-term debt securities. In addition to the announcement effects, it’s also possible that Federal Reserve purchases of longer-term securities affect yields by increasing market liquidity, at least temporarily. In this Economic Letter, we focus on these purchase effects. Specifically, we analyze how the Fed’s {{second round of}} asset purchases...|$|E

In equilibrium, real interest rates depend not only on shocks to consumption growth but also on expectations about future consumption growth volatility.

The indicator is able to capture the transition from anchored to unanchored expectations, implying a nonlinear pass-through of shocks to long-term expectations.

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{decomposition}} of nominal yields into real yields, expectations of future inflation and inflation risk premiums when real bonds or <b>inflation</b> <b>swaps</b> are unavailable or unreliable {{due to their}} relative illiquidity.

The filtering problem is numerically trivial and we conduct a battery of out-of-sample comparisons. Our favored model matches the quarterly inflation forecasts from surveys and uses the information in yields to produce the best monthly forecasts. Moreover, we restrict the distribution of the inflation Sharpe ratios to achieve economically reasonable estimates of the inflation risk premium and of the real rates. We find that the inflation risk premium (i) is positive on average, (ii) rises when the unemployment rate increases and (iii) when the level of interest rates decreases.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of inflation-linked bonds or <b>inflation</b> <b>swaps,</b> no perfect hedging {{strategy}} exists for inflation-linked liabilities, and nominal bonds are often used as substitute hedging instruments. This paper provides a formal analysis {{of the problem of}} hedging inflation-linked liabilities with nominal bonds in the presence of real rate uncertainty as well as realized and expected inflation risks. While a long-only position in nominal bonds will always have a negative exposure to unexpected inflation, our analysis suggests that long-short nominal bond portfolio strategies can in principle be designed to achieve a zero exposure to changes in unexpected inflation (required to hedge inflation-linked liabilities), while having a target exposure to changes in real rate equal to that of liabilities. The practical implementation of such long-short replication strategies, however, is not a straightforward task in the presence of parameter uncertainty. We explore several non-exclusive solutions to the estimation risk problem, including the use of conditional parameter estimation methodologies as well as the introduction of robust restrictions on input parameters or portfolio weights.

Moreover, their sensitivity to news about inflation and other domestic macroeconomic variables � a measure of anchoring � increased first during the oil price rally in 2006 � 07, and then during the heightened turmoil triggered {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers. Liquidity premia and technical factors have significantly influenced the behaviour of inflation-indexed markets since the outburst of the crisis. We show, however, that these factors did not contaminate the relationship between macroeconomic news and financial market-based inflation expectations at the daily frequency.
