40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{implementation}} of No Child Left Behind {{has created a}} push to use data driven decision making at all school sites. Often this move forward is based upon an assumption that a foundation of <b>data</b> <b>literacy</b> has been built. This study questions this assumption and aims to examine the <b>data</b> <b>literacy</b> capacities and needs of school leaders during this era of accountability.; First, school leaders' perception of their own <b>data</b> <b>literacy</b> was explored. This was followed by an examination of what supports and resources are in place to increase <b>data</b> <b>literacy,</b> as well as, what supports and resources needed to be added. Finally, the effect of <b>data</b> <b>literacy</b> on data driven decision making was analyzed.; This in depth study of school leader <b>data</b> <b>literacy</b> was accomplished through qualitative research methods. Twelve administrators were interviewed to explore their comfort with data and {{to determine how to}} best support their <b>data</b> <b>literacy.</b> Documents supporting their work with data was gathered and analyzed. Together, interview transcripts and documents were coded and analyzed for themes and patters.; The participants in this study demonstrated their <b>data</b> <b>literacy</b> knowledge and skills. All participants used data at their school sites. However, the level of data driven decision making varied between participants. Participants also discussed their challenges in engaging different stakeholders in using data. This was the area of <b>data</b> <b>literacy</b> that participants expressed the most need for further development. Participants wanted to develop <b>data</b> <b>literacy</b> through collaboration with other colleagues and suggested the need to dedicate time to focus on data literacy.; This study has evidenced the growth in <b>data</b> <b>literacy</b> but also shows the need to further increase <b>data</b> <b>literacy</b> in all educators. Data driven decision making is not conducted in isolation. To further implement data driven decision making successfully, all educators must learn how to use data appropriately. Also, technology resources must be available to support data driven decision making.

Data information literacy—the skills needed to understand, use, manage, share, work with, and produce data—reflects the confluence of data skills with information literacy competencies. This research assessed perceptions of <b>data</b> information <b>literacy</b> and attitudes on its instruction for graduate students in meteorology. As academic librarians have traditionally provided information literacy instruction, the research determined if they were perceived as having a role in <b>data</b> information <b>literacy</b> instruction. The modified Delphi method was applied to obtain the perspectives of a panel of experts, representing students, librarians, professors, and researchers, {{for the purpose of}} forecasting and consensus-making. Through the consid - eration of the University of Oslo’s Department of Geosciences’ Meteorol - ogy Section, the research found that <b>data</b> information <b>literacy</b> skills were relevant to the work of meteorology students.
