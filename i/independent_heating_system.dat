50|$|In April 2013, a {{cold wave}} swept across Tianjin and {{temperature}} dropped immediately. The municipal government’s {{central heating system}} had already stopped its supply on March 15. Without the heating supply, the theatre’s temperature could not reach 23℃ (the minimum requirement for normal performances), which directly caused the suspension of Royal New Zealand Ballet’s performance.

40|$|Evaporation is {{a process}} which {{consists}} of concentrating a solution various non-volatile compounds by boiling the volatile solvent. Evaporation may also represent an intermediate step before certain operations such as crystallization, precipitation, coagulation or drying. The concentrated product at {{the output of the}} operation remains in its liquid phase, which differentiates it from dried products. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize a single stage pilot vacuum evaporator (maximum evaporation capacity of approximately 30 kg of water•h- 1) in triple passes, with an <b>independent</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> for each pass, from the point of view of the mass and energy balance; the latter make to possible determin the energy losses. The temperature of the concentrate for each tube, the temperature of the condensate, the vacuum pressure, the temperature of the separator, and the output flow of the concentrated and condensed solutions were measured to achieve this. It was shown that minimum and maximum flow rate values should be respected for an optimal utilization of the equipment. Moreover, these flow rate limits change with heating power. The maximum flow rate was 46. 0 L. h- 1 and 55. 0 L. h- 1 for a heating power of 13. 5 kW and 27. 0 kW (maximum heating power), respectively. Mass and energy balance showed good correspondence between inlet and outlet flow, with a maximum error of less than 5 % and 3 %, respectively. Energy consumption was 2357. 0 kJ for 1. 0 kg of evaporated water. Evaporation capacity was found to vary with heating power, ranging from 11. 8 L. h- 1 to 30. 2 L. h- 1 for heating power ranging from 13. 5 kW to 27. 0 kW respectively. This pilot vacuum evaporator is thus a practical tool to simulate the behavior of dairy products in the concentration process with precise measurements and low feed quantities...|$|E
