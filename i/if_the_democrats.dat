5|$|Randall {{began to}} gain {{prominence}} in the small Democratic caucus by opposing Reconstruction measures. His delaying tactics against fellow Pennsylvanian Thaddeus Stevens's military Reconstruction bill in February 1867 kept the bill from being considered for two weeks—long enough {{to prevent it from}} being voted on until the next session. He likewise spoke against what would become the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Although he opposed the amendment, Randall did favor the idea behind part of it: section 4, which guarantees that Congress may not repudiate the federal debt, nor may it assume debts of the Confederacy, nor debt that the individual Confederate states incurred during the rebellion. Many Republicans claimed that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> were to regain power, they would do exactly that, repudiating federal debt and assuming that of the rebels. Despite disagreement on other facets of Reconstruction, Randall stood firmly with the Republicans (and most Northern Democrats) on the debt.|$|E
25|$|By the 1850s most Democratic {{party leaders}} had {{accepted}} many Whiggish ideas, {{and no one}} could deny the economic modernization of factories and railroads was moving ahead rapidly. The old economic issues died about the same time old leaders like Calhoun, Webster, Clay, Jackson and Polk passed from the scene. New issues, especially the questions of slavery, nativism and religion came to the fore. 1852 was the last hurrah for the Whigs; everyone realized they could win only <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> split in two. With the healing of the Free Soil revolt after 1852, Democratic dominance seemed assured. The Whigs went through the motions, but both rank and file and leaders quietly dropped out. The Third Party System was ready to emerge.|$|E
25|$|In South Australia, the Australian Democrats {{negotiated}} a crucial preference swap with Family First that prevented the Greens winning the final vacancy. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> had polled better, {{they would have}} collected Family First and Liberal preferences and won the final vacancy. Former Democrat Leader Meg Lees also contested the Senate in South Australia, but was eliminated late in the count. However, Lees did have some impact on the outcome, as there were large numbers of below the line preferences for both the Progressive Alliance (as well as One Nation) which were widely spread rather than flowing to the Democrats. When the Democrats were excluded, preferences flowed to Family First which prevented the Greens' Brian Noone passing the third Labor candidate. This resulted in a seat that could otherwise have been won by the Greens instead being won by Labor on Green preferences. The flow of One Nation preferences to Labor {{made it impossible for}} either Family First or the Liberal Party to win the final vacancy. Labor's Dana Wortley was elected to the final vacancy. The end result in South Australia was split 3 Liberal, 3 Labor.|$|E

500|$|Morton {{had already}} made several unconstitutional moves by acting on his own {{authority}} without legislative approval, including {{the establishment of the}} state arsenal, and the Democrats drafted legislation that attempted to reduce his authority. When Democrats in the state legislature sought to remove the state militia from Morton's [...] command and transfer it to a state board of Democratic commissioners, the governor immediately disbanded the Indiana General Assembly. He feared that once in control of militia, the Democrats might attempt to force him from office and secede from the Union. Morton issued secret instructions to Republican legislators, asking them to stay away from Indianapolis, the state capital, to prevent the General Assembly from attaining the quorum needed to pass any legislation. All but four Republicans fled to Madison, Indiana, where they could quickly flee into Kentucky <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> attempted to force their return to Indianapolis.|$|E

5000|$|Nearly all polls {{conducted}} in the {{months prior to the}} election showed that <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party would gain fewer parliamentary seats than the Pheu Thai Party, and even Democrat Party Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij admitted that, [...] "we're doing terribly in the polls" [...] and that, [...] "it was obvious from the beginning" [...] that they would not win a majority. [...] Newin Chidchob, de facto leader of coalition partner Bhum Jai Thai Party, predicted that <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party would win only 160 out of 500 seats.

500|$|The term [...] "Obamacare" [...] was {{originally}} coined by opponents as a pejorative. The term emerged in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott {{used it in}} a health industry journal, writing [...] "We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' {{to go along with}} 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s". According to research by Elspeth Reeve, the expression was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured. It first appeared in a political campaign by Mitt Romney in May 2007 in Des Moines, Iowa. Romney said, [...] "In my state, I worked on healthcare for some time. We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' And let me tell you, if we don't do it, the Democrats will. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care. It'll be what's known as Hillarycare or Barack Obamacare, {{or whatever you want to}} call it." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{few months}} after he entered the state Senate, in which he served {{alongside}} Claude B. Duval of Houma, Bauer ran in an open election for Louisiana's 3rd congressional district for the seat vacated by fellow Democrat Patrick T. Caffery, who stepped down after only two terms in office. He led the primary by 262 votes in an eight-candidate field, but he lost the runoff election to attorney and later Judge J. Louis Watkins, Jr., of Houma in Terrebonne Parish. Watkins was then defeated in the 1972 general election by David C. Treen, then of Jefferson Parish, the first Republican in the 20th century to represent Louisiana in Congress. Seven years later Treen was elected as the first Republican governor of his state since Reconstruction. Treen and a Republican [...] "search committee" [...] had offered to support Bauer for the House seat in 1972 <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> would switch parties, but Bauer remained Democrat and expected to face Treen in the general election.|$|R

[...] However, while allowing that many Republican members of Congress are [...] "resentful {{of the way he}} and the White House conducted the losing campaign", the New York Times also stated that, [...] "White House officials say President Bush has every intention of keeping Mr. Rove on through the rest of his term." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Populists {{had already}} {{nominated}} the ticket of Bryan and Charles A. Towne, a pro-silver Republican from Minnesota, with the tacit understanding that Towne would step aside <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> nominated someone else. Bryan preferred {{his good friend}} Towne, but Democrats wanted one of their own, and the regular element of the party felt comfortable with Stevenson. Towne withdrew and campaigned for Bryan and Stevenson. As a result, Stevenson, who had run with Cleveland in 1892, now ran in 1900 with Cleveland's opponent Bryan. Twenty-five years senior to Bryan, Stevenson added age and experience to the ticket. Nevertheless, their effort failed badly against the Republican ticket of McKinley and Roosevelt. (Stevenson's role in the race is perhaps more distinguished by his being the first Vice President to win nomination for that office with a different running mate, after having completed his first term. As of 2017, Republican Charles W. Fairbanks's failure to win a second VP term in 1916 is the only example since.) ...|$|E

2500|$|With two liberal Democrats from Philadelphia {{heading the}} statewide ticket, in {{addition}} to a liberal Democrat in the White House, Republicans gleefully went on the attack. The favorite issue raised was a familiar one: the likelihood of annexation of Delaware County by the City of Philadelphia.

[...] He further elaborated that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> win, it [...] "will be {{the beginning of the end}} of home rule" [...] for the county and the election will be a [...] "fight for survival for Delaware County".

Before that could be done, however, a great political agitation sprang up. The slave States were greatly excited over the prospect of a Republican president being chosen, for the Republicans were to a great extent identified with the abolition movement; and public feeling, which had for some time run high, became intensified as the time approached for the election of a new president, and threats that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> were beaten and a Republican elected the slave States would secede from the Union, were freely indulged in.|$|E

60|$|The want of {{this close}} {{connection}} with Congress and the President's ministers {{has been so}} much felt that it has been found necessary to create a medium of communication. This has been done by a system which has now become a recognized part of the machinery of the government, but which is, I believe, founded on no regularly organized authority; at any rate, no provision is made for it in the Constitution, nor, as far as I am aware, has it been established by any special enactment or written rule. Nevertheless, I believe I am justified in saying that it has become a recognized link in the system of government adopted by the United States. In each House standing committees are named, to which are delegated the special consideration of certain affairs of State. There are, for instance, Committees of Foreign Affairs, of Finance, the Judiciary Committee, and others of a similar nature. To these committees are referred all questions which come before the House bearing on the special subject to which each is devoted. Questions of taxation are referred to the Finance Committee before they are discussed in the House; and the House, when it goes into such discussion, has before it the report of the committee. In this way very much of the work of the legislature is done by branches of each House, and by selected men whose time and intellects are devoted to special subjects. It is easy to see that much time and useless debate may be thus saved; and I am disposed to believe that this system of committees has worked efficiently and beneficially. The mode of selection of the members has been so contrived as to give to each political party that amount of preponderance in each committee which such party holds in the House. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> have in the Senate a majority, it would be within their power to vote none but Democrats into the Committee on Finance; but this would be manifestly unjust to the Republican party, and the injustice would itself frustrate the object of the party in power; therefore the Democrats simply vote to themselves a majority in each committee, keeping to themselves as great a preponderance in the committee as they have in the whole House, and arranging also that the chairman of the committee shall belong to their own party. By these committees the chief legislative measures of the country are originated and inaugurated, as they are with us by the ministers of the Crown; and the chairman of each committee is supposed to have a certain amicable relation with that minister who presides over the office with which his committee is connected. Mr. Sumner is at present chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and he is presumed to be in connection with Mr. Seward, who, as Secretary of State, has the management of the foreign relations of the government.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to provide}} answers {{to whether the}} {{politics}} of <b>the</b> Swedish <b>Democrats</b> contains elements of xenophobia. <b>The</b> Swedish <b>Democrats</b> have become a major political party in Sweden. Today they are the Swedish parliament's third largest political party. Due to an ambition to grow as a party even more, <b>the</b> Swedish <b>Democrats</b> have a stated ambition of zero tolerance against racists. Nevertheless, the party has continued to build its policy on an immigration-critical agenda. Other parliamentary parties have so far not wanted to cooperate with <b>the</b> Swedish <b>Democrats</b> {{with reference to the}} party's xenophobic policy. However, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Swedish <b>Democrats</b> continue to grow in size as a party, it will become increasingly difficult for other parties to continue ignoring the party's influence in the Swedish parliament. The study has consisted of rhetorical analysis of <b>the</b> Swedish <b>Democrats</b> party platforms from the party's formation until today. This analysis shows that the image the party gives of itself in the party platform has not changed significantly since the party was formed. However, the latest party platform of <b>the</b> Swedish <b>Democrats</b> includes more features of xenophobia than their first party program did. The policy of <b>the</b> Sweden <b>Democrats</b> thus still contains xenophobic elements...|$|R
