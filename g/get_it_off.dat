To <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the ground, Wenner borrowed $7,500 from his own family and from the parents of his soon-to-be wife, Jane Schindelheim. The first issue carried a cover date of November 9, 1967, and was in newspaper format with a lead article on the Monterey Pop Festival. The cover price was 25¢ (equivalent to $ in 2016).|$|E
25|$|Nimble, Capital and General Geddes reached Key West on 24 December and Florida and Thorn {{returned}} from Cuba the next day, their crews having been released unharmed. One of the Africans on Surprize died before reaching Key West, so 121 were unloaded there. Lt. Holden {{claimed that the}} Africans were under his protection because Guerrero had surrendered to him. The Collector of Customs for the port claimed custody of the Africans {{because they had been}} landed in American territory after being shipwrecked. The wreckers claimed salvage on Nimble for helping to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the reef and replace the rudder. Lt. Holden refused to submit to the arbitration procedure established by Florida territorial law, which would have let a panel of local residents, almost all of whom had a financial stake in wrecking, decide how much in salvage fees were due the wreckers. Nimble left Key West without the Africans, and the wreckers remained unpaid. Nimble delivered the 20 Cuban crewmen it was holding to Havana to be dealt with by the British-Spanish Mixed Commission Court that dealt with Spanish slave-runners caught near Cuba.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the family}} can call it a day, they arrive home and find Amber and Ginger waiting in their driveway. Amber shows Marge and the kids video footage of a drunk Homer marrying Amber in Vegas, while Ginger is next door with the widowed Ned Flanders. Homer tries to get his {{marriage}} to Amber annulled by the court, but Judge Constance Harm refuses, stating that Homer married Amber in Nevada and the marriage still stands, since Homer never officially divorced Amber. Marge is so angry that she banishes Homer, who takes up residence in Bart's treehouse with Amber. Homer still loves Marge and refuses to sleep with Amber, so he tries to sleep in Santa's Little Helper's kennel, but ends up getting its doorway stuck to his head and spends {{the rest of the}} night trying to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> The next day, Marge finds Homer asleep amid the broken remains of the doghouse, and she tells Homer that she is still angry at Homer over what he did, but she has a plan to get Amber out of their house.|$|E
500|$|During the {{subsequent}} media coverage, {{the game was}} removed from shelves by some vendors, including both UK and international branches of Game and Dixons. Rockstar responded to this move by stating, [...] "we have always appreciated Dixons as a retail partner, and we fully respect their actions. We are naturally very surprised and disappointed that any retailer would choose to pull any game ... We reject any suggestion or association between the tragic events and the sale of Manhunt." [...] Rockstar also reiterated that the game was intended for adults only; [...] "Rockstar Games is a leading publisher of interactive entertainment geared towards mature audiences, and [...] markets its games responsibly, targeting advertising and marketing only to adult consumers ages 18 and older." [...] As the media speculated that the game could be banned completely, there was a [...] "significantly increased" [...] demand for it both from retailers and on Internet auction sites. Giselle Pakeerah responded to this by saying [...] "it doesn't really come as surprise, they say no publicity is bad publicity. But I must say I'm saddened and disappointed. The content of this game is contemptible. It's a societal hazard and my concern is to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the shelves as there's enough violence in society already." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{top of his}} {{technical}} talent, Friday {{was physically}} very strong and able to withstand sustained blows or injuries. According to Hamilton, he was also uncommonly fit despite his lifestyle. He boasted an exceptional work-rate, which Dwyer recalled gave any side including him a strong boost: [...] "When {{he was in the}} line-up you'd have a centre-forward and a centre-half; not only would he be up there running them ragged, but when it broke down he'd be the first person to start tackling back". He was assisted in this by a smooth and effective sliding tackle which despite all of Friday's attacking skills Hurley considered one of the strongest parts of his game. Reading F.C. historian David Downs described Friday's style of play as [...] "really quite bizarre. It was more or less Robin standing in the middle and saying 'Give me the ball and I'll see what I can do with it'". On receiving the ball, he would then turn and either take on the opposing defence single-handed or run with it to the wing to cross for a teammate. [...] "We didn't need anyone else up front", Hurley later said. [...] "They couldn't get the ball off him. He was {{one of those guys who}} could beat five players easily". Andrews agreed: [...] "once he'd got the ball it was almost impossible to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> him".|$|E

500|$|Although Groening has {{pitched a}} number of {{spin-offs}} from The Simpsons, those attempts have been unsuccessful. In 1994, Groening and other Simpsons producers pitched a live-action spin-off about Krusty the Clown (with Dan Castellaneta playing the lead role), but were unsuccessful in <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the ground. Groening has also pitched [...] "Young Homer" [...] and a spin-off about the non-Simpsons citizens of Springfield.|$|R

500|$|Wired News has awarded Duke Nukem Forever its Vaporware Award several times. It placed {{second in}} June 2000 and topped {{the list in}} 2001 and 2002. Wired {{magazine}} created the Vaporware Lifetime Achievement Award exclusively for DNF and awarded it in 2003. George Broussard accepted the award, simply stating, [...] "We're undeniably late and we know it." [...] In 2004, the game {{did not make the}} top 10; Wired editors said that they had given DNF the Lifetime Achievement Award to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> of the list. However, upon readers' demands, Wired changed its mind, and DNF won first place in 2005, 2006, and 2007. In 2008, Wired staff officially considered removing DNF from their annual list, citing that [...] "even the best jokes get old eventually", only to reconsider upon viewing the handheld camera footage of the game in The Jace Hall Show, awarding the game with first place once again. In 2009, Wired published Wired News' Vaporware Awards 2009: Duke Nukem Forever was excluded from consideration {{on the grounds that the}} project was finally dead. Duke made a comeback with an unprecedented 11th place award on Wireds 2010 Vaporware list. When the GameSpy editors compiled a list of the [...] "Top 25 Dumbest Moments in Gaming History" [...] in June 2003, Duke Nukem Forever placed #18. Duke Nukem Forever has drawn a number of jokes related to its development timeline. The video gaming media and public in general have routinely suggested several names in place of Forever, calling it [...] "Never", [...] "(Taking) Forever", [...] "Whenever", [...] "ForNever", [...] "Neverever", and [...] "If Ever". The game has also been ridiculed as Duke Nukem: Forever In Development, [...] "Either this is the longest game ever in production or an elaborate in-joke at the expense of the industry".|$|E

[...] SMN reported the J-15 could operate from the carrier equipped with two YJ-83K anti-ship missiles, two short-range PL-8 air-to-air missiles, and four [...] bombs, but a weapons load exceeding 12 tons would not <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the ski jump, prohibiting it from carrying heavier munitions such as PL-12 medium-range air-to-air missiles, making it an unlikely match if hostile fighters are encountered when flying strike missions; furthermore, it can [...] only carry two tons of weapons while fully fueled, limiting it to no more than two YJ-83Ks and two PL-8s.|$|E

2500|$|Deterred {{from using}} 32hp (24kW) Bristol Cherub {{flat-twin}} engines owing to vibration problems, the Cockle {{began with a}} pair of V-twin Blackburne Tomtits. [...] Ungeared and so limited to the maximum 2,400 rpm of the propellers, the Tomtits could produce only 16hp (12kW). [...] It is not surprising that, {{when it came to the}} first flight, the Cockle was underpowered. [...] Before the aircraft was complete the bare hull (always Short's main concern) was floated for a day in April 1924 and found to be satisfactorily watertight. [...] Attempts to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the water began in September, but did not succeed until 7 November 1924, with its wing at a higher angle of incidence and its pilot lightly dressed. [...] It has been suggested that it flew only because the atmospheric pressure was exceptionally high that day.|$|E
2500|$|Further, Wilby {{submitted}} {{that the}} Council committed {{a criminal act}} when they allowed the movement of toxic waste without a licence: in 1986 there was no proper permission in place for moving the contaminated waste, only for moving 'inert' waste. Inspectors were not told {{the true nature of}} the substances involved and so took only sporadic samples from the site. Wilby said that the council had deliberately ignored the advice from experts to properly analyse the site because it was going to be an expensive task. He said: [...] "They decided they were going to do this 'dig-and-dump'. They thought 'we have got this great deal of land and all this spoil on this site which must be contaminated, we have got to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> there because we'll never be able to sell it.'" [...] Records demonstrated that in one test which took place in 1983 only five soil samples were collected to represent a [...] area.|$|E
2500|$|The TC.33 first flew on 23 February 1932. [...] Development flying {{showed it}} had good {{performance}} but suffered from elevator and rudder flutter. [...] The former was cured with mass balancing but the rudder flutter persisted, particularly in high speed dives until the rudders were redesigned. [...] It was {{exhibited at the}} 1932 RAF Hendon Display {{and then went on}} to RAF Martlesham Heath for trials. [...] Once in the air, the TC.33 was judged a pleasant machine to fly, but it was crucially let down by its full load take off performance. [...] Even at Martlesham it was hard to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the ground in a reasonable distance. [...] The undercarriage behaviour was also criticised. [...] Because of these concerns over take off performance at English temperatures and altitudes, the Air Ministry did not place an order, judging it would not cope with the [...] hot and high conditions found at many RAF fields across the Empire. Thus J9832 {{was the only one of}} its kind. Indeed, none of the C.16/28 contenders were awarded a production contract.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{believe the}} police covered up what happened. On January 1, Liston's wife called Johnny Tocco {{and said she}} hadn't heard from her husband in three days and was worried. A few years before Tocco died, he {{allegedly}} told his good friend, Tony Davi, {{that he went to}} Liston's house and found the door locked and his car in the driveway. Tocco called the police, and they broke into the house. Tocco said that the living room furniture was in disarray, but the house did not yet smell of death. He said they found Sonny lying on his bed with a needle sticking out of his arm. Johnny left the house before the police did. [...] "Johnny wasn't a braggart," [...] Davi told Liston biographer Paul Gallender. [...] "He told me in the strictest confidence, but it was like he wanted to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> his chest." [...] Gallender claims, [...] "A lot of officers knew Sonny was dead before Geraldine returned home on January 5, but they chose to let him rot." ...|$|E
2500|$|The more {{high-profile}} unit preserved is {{the former}} South West Trains (SWT) [...] "celebrity" [...] unit painted in BR blue livery with painted aluminium window frames, number 3417. The unit was initially used on Wimbledon depot as a shunter, but with SWT needing to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> its books it was sold to the Bluebell Railway for the nominal sum of £1. It was moved to Eastleigh Works for storage, after having been used initially as the centrepiece for the Bluebell in a ceremony at East Grinstead railway station to mark the commencement of work at the station site {{as part of the}} line's work on the northern extension. The unit returned to East Grinstead for further use and storage in September 2010. In late April, the unit sustained minor damage to its shoegear as it was being towed from Clapham Junction Yard to the Swanage Railway. This resulted in the traction current being discharged in the yard overnight, whilst repairs were carried out. The unit was for some time stabled in the open at Clapham Junction, having been stored in the shed at the yard, but after a spell at Ilford depot being restored, the unit is now at Strawberry Hill, being maintained by a group of volunteers.|$|E
