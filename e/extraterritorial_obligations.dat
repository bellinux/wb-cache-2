40|$|The {{return of}} failed asylum seekers is an {{integral}} part of each state s migration management policy and border control. However such returns must be balanced by respect for human rights. This is especially pertinent in a time when the Norwegian government has made it a major focus of policy to step up their effort to return failed asylum seekers. The purpose of this thesis has therefore been to analyze what the responsibilities of the Norwegian government are towards failed asylum seekers who are forcefully returned. In answering this question, it has been argued for the existence of an <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>obligation</b> to investigate allegations of ill-treatment in the post-return phase. Several dilemmas and chal-lenges present itself in this phase, lack of knowledge being one of them, another being the lack of priority from the political government in Norway. Additionally it seems that the mechanisms put in place function more as a warning sign, than actual protection of the returnee. It concludes that the responsibilities ensure the protection of the failed asylum seeker to a certain degree, but there is a lack of information about the effects of the return. It has, therefore, become apparent that the government can do more to protect failed asy-lum seekers...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the late}} 1970 s, what we today label ‘globalisation’ has altered {{many aspects of}} {{international}} law, not least international human rights law. This has been reflected inter alia in increased calls for universal {{respect for human rights}} beyond a state’s territorial border. The challenges to territoriality in this regard does not only relate to the actions of states abroad, but also with respect to their regulation of the conduct of business enterprises over which they exert significant influence. The chapter analyses the European Court of Human Rights’ jurisprudence and practice of the UN human rights bodies, and argues that <b>extraterritorial</b> human rights <b>obligations</b> have {{become an integral part of}} international human rights law. It is held that what has been seen as ‘exceptional’ now represent ‘common practice’. This conclusion is then applied to the discussion of the new treaty on human rights as currently being drafted...|$|R

Climate change projects in so-called "developing" countries are often financed and/or also implemented by industrialised countries. The research project ClimAccount Human Rights Accountability of the EU and Austria for Climate Policies in Third Countries and their possible Effects on Migration focused on the accountability of the EU and its Member States with regard to negative impacts of climate change measures {{they are involved in}} on human rights in third countries - especially those associated with "migration effects". Based on three case studies - projects registered under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism - the human rights dimension of climate change action was discussed, areas of human rights concerns that were discernible in all three case study projects were identified, the issue of <b>extraterritorial</b> human rights <b>obligations</b> was analysed and the subject of access to justice was scrutinized...|$|R

The Maastricht Principles enunciate the parameters within which <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>obligations</b> must be discharged. Economic globalization fosters an accountability gap and has made evident an imbalance between the scope of influence of states {{and the way in which}} their legal responsibility is defined. Still, the extraterritorial dimensions of economic and social rights have been approached by courts and human rights expert bodies in a largely ad hoc fashion.

40|$|The {{provision}} of consular assistance {{is critical to}} nationals who face criminal proceedings abroad which may result in the death penalty. In recent years {{the importance of a}} detained foreign national accessing consular authorities from their home state has been recognised as both a human right and an individual right in international law. Despite this, the question of whether there is an obligation on the national’s home state to provide consular assistance has yet to be answered. This article makes a case for the emergence of such a right to consular assistance in capital cases for nationals of states which have abolished the death penalty. With reference to both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights, the article locates this emerging right within a state’s positive obligation to protect life. It is recognised that for any such emerging right to be meaningful it must be capable of being enforced. The article therefore addresses the particular challenges of extraterritorially applying a right to consular assistance and proposes the return to a previous, more flexible, understanding of <b>extraterritorial</b> human rights <b>obligations</b> on consular agents...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} {{framework}} {{for the application of}} human rights treaty <b>obligations</b> in <b>extraterritorial</b> armed conflict situations. Traditionally it is International Humanitarian Law (‘IHL’) that governs the conduct of States during military operations abroad. However the humanitarian desire to increase the protections afforded by international law to individuals affected by armed conflict has gradually resulted in the recognition that International Human Rights Law (‘IHRL’) applies alongside IHL in armed conflict situations. This development is, however, associated with significant uncertainties as to the scope of the human rights obligations of States conducting military operations abroad and the relationship between IHL and IHRL in such circumstances. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to this debate by proposing {{a framework for}} {{a better understanding of the}} dual operation of IHL and IHRL when States conduct military operations abroad. The central argument of this thesis is that the scope of a State’s <b>extraterritorial</b> human rights <b>obligations</b> should depend upon the degree of effective control it exercises over the territory in which it is operating. IHRL is generally predicated on the capacity of the State to control territory and individuals within that territory. States frequently, however, are only able to exercise a limited amount of control beyond their territorial borders. Consequently, doubts as to the practicability of the extraterritorial application of human rights treaty obligations permeate much of the existing case law and literature. States are unlikely to accept any <b>extraterritorial</b> IHRL <b>obligations</b> that are perceived as unreasonable or unrealistic. Against this background, this thesis argues that human rights treaty obligations should be applied with a degree of flexibility in extraterritorial armed conflict situations. This flexible approach relies on the concept of effective control in arguing that, depending on the level of control it exercises, a State may initially have a limited range and level of human rights obligations but as its level of effective control over the territory increases so does not only the range but also the level of its human rights obligations. The exercise of effective control is thus a prerequisite for the human rights obligations of States conducting military operations abroad to arise. The existing State practice, jurisprudence and literature on the effective control test, however, are relatively limited and somewhat confused. The thesis analyses relevant legal discourse and develops a unified structure of effective control by identifying factors relevant to determining when effective control over territory exists. The notion of effective control as developed in this thesis is not only central for the activation of human rights treaties in armed conflict situations, but as this thesis argues, can also determine the extent of the range and level of human rights obligations of States conducting military operations abroad. The thesis proposes a novel, practical and flexible framework for the gradual activation of the full range and level of a State’s human rights treaty <b>obligations</b> in <b>extraterritorial</b> armed conflict situations based on the degree of effective control exercised. This proposed framework takes into account the realities of extraterritorial armed conflict situations, and thus has the potential to achieve greater compliance by States with their human rights treaty obligations and hopefully might ultimately result in the enhanced protection of individuals caught up in armed conflict.

40|$|The article {{argues that}} the facticity {{of the human rights}} impacts of {{economic}} globalisation increasingly undermines the normativity of the state-centred conception of international human rights law. The exposure of the international legal order of states to the operations of global business entities leads to a collusion of sovereign state interest and globalised corporate power at the expense of protecting the rights of victims of human rights violations. The article scrutinises two prominent attempts to address this lacuna of protection: transnational tort litigation and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. It is argued that both approaches are not only an expression of the present crisis of international human rights law but also risk contributing to its perpetuation. While the ‘escape into tort’ results in the privatisation of public human rights in the global market economy, the UN Guiding Principles entrench their territorialisation in the state legal order in the face of global economic challenges. The concluding section reflects on the future pathways of international human rights law by positing a choice between, on the one hand, a more radical departure from human rights’ state-centred heritage and, on the other hand, a transformation of the international legal order of states by virtue of human rights. It highlights the importance of <b>extraterritorial</b> human rights <b>obligations</b> in recovering the state’s legal accountability for human rights violations committed in the course of global business operations...|$|R

It concludes that a potentially more effective complaints mechanism could have been created.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{contributes}} to the ongoing debate regarding <b>extraterritorial</b> human rights <b>obligations</b> with a specific focus on development cooperation. Various international human rights instruments enshrine the obligation to take steps through international assistance and cooperation towards the realisation of economic, social and cultural rights, yet the legal standing of the obligation remains contested, {{and a number of}} gaps remain as regards our understanding and application of the obligation. This study first considers the legal foundations of the obligation of international assistance and cooperation, reaffirming its existence as a legal duty, not just a moral one. With reference to the output of treaty bodies, reports of UN Special Procedures and relevant academic commentary, the various aspects the obligation are clarified and placed within the context of international development cooperation. Specific extraterritorial duties in relation to the rights to education and health are also. identified. In order to provide contextual description of the obligation and means of its implementation, examination and comparison of development activities of American and British bilateral development agencies in Ghana is undertaken. Legislation, policies and activities of the United States and United Kingdom are explored to ascertain {{the degree to which they}} are consistent with elements of the obligation of international assistance and cooperation, and to assess the impact that their aid initiatives have on the exercise of the rights to education and health elsewhere. Although neither the US nor UK recognise the legal character of the obligation of international assistance and cooperation, there are some encouraging signs with regard to implementation of its various components. However, the analysis also makes apparent that as the obligation continues to evolve there remain a number of significant challenges to its acceptance and wider implementation.

40|$|Section I {{begins by}} setting out certain {{provisions}} added by the Lisbon Treaty requiring the European Union to promote human rights, democracy, {{and the rule}} of law in all its “relations with the wider world. ” Section II then recounts a recent interpretation of these provisions, which understands them primarily as mandating compliance with international law, and thus largely denies <b>extraterritorial</b> human rights <b>obligations</b> to protect. While the fundamentals of this “compliance” reading are correct, Section III demonstrates that the notion of international law involved here entertains an expansive view of prescriptive jurisdiction, that is, a political institution’s authority to prescribe rules binding conduct. Indeed, despite precedent from the General Court claiming otherwise, the European Union regularly creates legal effects outside its borders, and has always done so. This is reflected both in the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), as well as in EU legislation, particularly in areas such as competition, financial, and environmental regulation, all of which have profound implications for the human rights of distant strangers. Section IV argues, from a premise of human dignity as lying in autonomy, that human rights obligations arise only in relations of political authority, not mere factual power. By reference to Strasbourg case-law on extraterritorial human rights jurisdiction, it demonstrates that the creation of legal effects abroad is both necessary and sufficient to give rise to human rights obligations there, and rejects accounts of human rights jurisdiction based upon aspects of factual power, such as the “state control” and “capability” theories. If, as this paper argues, the European Union regularly governs persons overseas, this raises the specter of imperialism, which is touched upon in the conclusion...|$|R
40|$|The more ‘globalization’ {{transforms}} ‘national public goods’ {{demanded by}} citizens into transnational ‘aggregate public goods’, the stronger becomes {{the need for}} reviewing ‘Westphalian governance failures’ and related ‘legal methodologies’ (Section I). Resolving the ‘constitutional problems’ and ‘collective action problems’ of multilevel governance (e. g. in terms of constituting, limiting, regulating and justifying multilevel governance powers, participation and representation of citizens in governance and dispute settlement, rule of law protecting cosmopolitan rights) requires supplementing national Constitutions by ‘multilevel cosmopolitan constitutionalism’ empowering citizens and multilevel governance institutions to realize their collective responsibility for protecting human rights, {{rule of law and}} other interdependent public goods across frontiers (Section II). The prevailing ‘political realism’ and ‘constitutional nationalism’ neglect the customary law requirements of interpreting international treaties and settling disputes ‘in conformity with the principles of justice and international law’, including ‘human rights and fundamental freedoms for all’, in order to limit democratic accountability of governments (Section III). Human rights and multilevel protection of ‘principles of justice’ require cosmopolitan law based on constitutional, ‘public choice’- and economic regulatory strategies limiting multilevel ‘governance failures’ as well as ‘market failures’ (Section IV). The human rights obligations of all UN member states limit governmental ‘margins of appreciation’ in dealing with economic crises and related austerity programmes (Section V). Governments and courts of justice must reconcile and ‘balance’ civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights depending on their diverse ‘contexts of justice’ and protect transnational rule of law {{not only in terms of}} rights and obligations of governments, but also as cosmopolitan rights of citizens as ‘agents of justice’ and ‘democratic owners’ of all governance institutions (Section VI).

40|$|The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), in {{its design}} and {{implementation}} procedures, does not reflect a human rights approach. There is an ever-growing community of critical voices, however, requiring that human rights {{should serve as a}} corrective to intellectual property rights and their implementation in the context of TRIPS. The crucial question is, of course, how this goal may be accomplished. Under TRIPS, human rights constitute non-essential exceptions to intellectual property rights. However, obligations under international human rights law (IHRL) can only be a relevant consideration if either the World Trade Organisation (WTO) itself or its members, when acting as such—or both—are bound by IHRL. If this should be the case, the question as to the exact relationship between the norms under TRIPS and those of IHRL will arise. Is IHRL hierarchically superior to WTO law? This chapter will show that both the WTO and its members, as such, are the bearers of obligations under IHRL and that, in many instances, norms of IHRL will have to be held to rank above “international trade law”. This should have consequences in particular for the way the WTO enforces TRIPS within its dispute settlement system. The rules of treaty interpretation under customary international law (as codified in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969) offer substantial scope for human rights considerations {{to play a role in}} WTO dispute settlement. Attempts at establishing conformity between TRIPS and IHRL should, moreover, take account of <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>obligations</b> flowing from the various UN human rights treaties, specifically also the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) of 1966, and their implications for state conduct. States parties to the ICESCR are not only obliged to observe Covenant provisions where the effects of any of their actions are confined to the domestic level, but also if their conduct, for example within the WTO, affects the economic, social and cultural rights (ESCR) of populations in other countries. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), the body of independent experts supervising implementation of the ICESCR—which so far has proven highly capable of advancing the cause of ESCR globally—should adopt a more proactive approach in defining <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>obligations</b> under the ICESCR, also in relation to WTO law, and should further be bold enough to adopt a clear stance in cases of conflict between TRIPS and IHRL...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decades {{there has been}} a great deal of {{attention}} for concepts aiming to prevent gross human rights violations, such as conflict prevention and the responsibility to protect. Despite this shift in attention towards prevention, it has remained unclear what legal obligations states have to prevent gross human rights violations under international human rights law. For example, it is unclear what types of obligations states have at different points in time, when they are triggered, what concrete measures they may require and how they apply outside a state’s territory. This study sets out to systematically assess the content and scope of obligations to prevent gross human rights violations. To be able to understand obligations to prevent in their interconnection, the focus is on three specific types of injury prohibited under international human rights law: torture, arbitrary death and genocide. Further distinctions are made between four temporal phases (long-term prevention, short-term prevention, preventing continuation, preventing recurrence) and territorial and <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>obligations.</b> A point of analysis throughout the study is how the capacity of states influences the content and scope of obligations to prevent gross human rights violations in territorial and extraterritorial settings...|$|E
40|$|Global tax {{abuse is}} one of the key {{obstacles}} to sustainable development. Each year more than USD one trillion are lost to cross border tax abuse and stored away in tax havens. We establish that tax abuse accumulates capital, makes tax systems more regressive and diminishes government revenues. Tax abuse consequently indirectly increases economic inequality and relative poverty and reduces social expenditure affecting both dimensions of economic and social rights fulfillment: the ability of people to claim their rights in the market place or through the provision of entitlements. We test our theory in a cross-sectional study and find empirical evidence for several of the factors in our theory. Both revenue generation and expenditure of fiscal policy are subject to the obligations to progressively realize economic and social human rights by using the maximum of available resources. We confirm that Mozambique has respect, protect and fulfill obligations to refrain from granting extensive tax exemptions, prevent tax avoidance and prosecute tax evasion. State parties hosting and controlling multinational corporations committing tax abuse abroad have similar <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>obligations.</b> Tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions deliberately undermine the sovereignty of other states in domestic resource mobilization for rights fulfillment...|$|E
40|$|The Global Goals {{adopted in}} 2015 are {{the next phase}} in the UN’s plans to tackle poverty and the {{systemic}} causes of under-development and other global problems. As with the previous Millennium Development Goals, the Global Goals are expressly political in nature. This paper considers the function, status and role of international law in global development and, in particular, how the Global Goals might be perceived in legal terms. The paper rejects the argument that they represent customary law due to weaknesses in State practice and opinio juris, and is unpersuaded that {{it is helpful to}} categorise them as soft law as their purpose is aspirational and not regulatory. Thus, the Goals exist in an arena of contested legality. Two “re-imaginings” of international law are proposed; first, by connecting them to the non-binding Maastricht Principles on the <b>Extraterritorial</b> <b>Obligations</b> of States in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and secondly, by linking them to ideas of international solidarity. The paper concludes that neither provides easy solutions.

40|$|International {{financial}} institutions and transnational corporations exert increasing influence on {{the human rights of}} populations worldwide. Simultaneously, growing global power imbalances make it increasingly difficult for weaker States to assert full control over policies that are central to their ability to fulfill their human rights obligations. While international human rights norms, and particularly economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights, may have an important role to play in addressing this power imbalance, the existing human rights legal framework is ill-equipped to deal with economic globalization and the human rights impact of powerful global actors. This Paper proposes a way in which these actors may be held accountable for their impacts under existing international human rights law. It first discusses accountability gaps in international law that undermine effective implementation of ESC rights, particularly those relating to non-state and foreign actors. It then critiques two existing arguments on how to read <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>obligations</b> into the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and proposes an alternative method that differentiates between the types of extraterritorial rights obligations that a State may incur. It concludes by suggesting specific ways that international {{financial institutions}} and transnational corporations can be held indirectly accountable for the ESC rights violations to which they contribute...|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} {{considers}} the involuntary resettlement of about 950 people in August 2014 {{as part of}} the Olkaria IV project. Olkaria IV is a 140 MW geothermal power plant in Kenya, constructed with the financial support of European and other international finance institutions (IFIs). The Olkaria area by now has four plants and another four are being planned. In addition to Olkaria, geothermal exploration has been undertaken elsewhere in the Rift Valley. All Kenyan geothermal power plants, in Olkaria and elsewhere, are already or are expected to be registered as Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects. Geothermal power also accommodates international donors’ and development banks’ official commitments to support climate mitigation. In this context the Olkaria IV resettlement may serve as a showcase of the socioeconomic challenges and human rights infringements project affected people are exposed to. The case study discusses the alleged human rights violations and disentangles the complex web of responsibilities. It provides for local background information, discusses the national and international legal frameworks, and puts its focus on the <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>obligations</b> of the financiers, in particular of the European Investment Bank and its shareholders: the EU and the EU member states.

40|$|In general, {{human rights}} {{obligations}} {{are restricted to}} states' actions within their own territory {{in relation to their}} own citizens and residents. However, article 55 (c) of the Charter of the United Nations refers to the promotion of 'universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion', while article 56 affirms that '[a]ll Members pledge themselves to take joint and separate action, in cooperation with the Organisation, for the achievement of the purposes set forth in article 55 '. Thus, states must promote human rights both individually and jointly. Furthermore, the Vienna Declaration affirms that the promotion and protection of human rights is a legitimate concern of the international community. Therefore, the implementation of human rights is clearly not a purely domestic matter. This is also evident from the horizontal operation of human rights between states as it is actually states which are the principal addressees of international human rights law. Inter-state complaint procedures are used to 'act in the common interest of protecting human rights'. Furthermore, jurisprudence, international treaties, soft law, and customary international law provide examples of a progressive development of the extension of the scope of human rights obligations beyond state borders. In particular, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), has interesting provisions which reveal that the 'existence of <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>obligations</b> in relationship to international cooperation and assistance based on specific provisions of the Covenant [is] clear'.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{investigate}} possible constraints in the European legal {{order on the}} use of drone operations in extraterritorial situations. This includes an analysis of the EU law on competences in the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). The analysis of EU law is focused on the competences of the European Parliament to constrain the actions of the EU under the CFSP as well as the role of the CFSP as a decisive factor in security and capability developments. The second part of the analysis focus on the case law of the ECtHR on extraterritorial applicability of the European Convention on Human Rights. I investigate whether there exist a legal basis in the jurisprudence of the Court to argue that the application of drone technology will itself trigger a jurisdictional link, thereby constraining what constitutes legal operations with drones in extraterritorial situations. I conclude that the intergovernmental paradigm of the Common Foreign and Security Policy denies the European Parliament a decisive {{role in the development of}} a constraining policy {{on the use of}} drones, but that the area of the CFSP plays a role in conflict prevention and -solution, and that drone capabilities will likely become a factor in the coming decades. In the second part of the analysis I argue that there exist no basis in the case law of the ECtHR that drone operations will trigger <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>obligations</b> of States, in and by itself. This emanates mainly from the ECtHR’s restrictive interpretation of jurisdiction as primarily territorial and exercised extraterritorially only in exceptional cases...|$|E
40|$|States are reticent {{to support}} the idea that they have human rights {{obligations}} to people other than their own. However decades of United Nations consideration and human rights standard-setting in the area of international cooperation have advanced interpretations of the obligation whereby economic and other policies should be designed {{in such a way as}} to avoid causing injury to the interests of developing States and to the rights of their people, and, moreover, should actively seek to address existing deprivations. This latter obligation to fulfil socio-economic rights elsewhere gives rise to a host of important legal issues that provide the focus for this article. Should we understand the obligations to be those of individual States or can we speak of collective legal obligations in this area? Is the extraterritorial obligation to fulfil socio-economic rights limited to the transfer of financial resources, and if not what else might it entail? Are they best framed as secondary obligations triggered only if the rights-holder’s own State is unable or unwilling to fulfil them or as simultaneous obligations? If, as per the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and its monitoring Committee we recognise capacity as a basis to assist, how might the obligations among all those States with capacity be divided? In complying with these positive obligations of international assistance and cooperation what would constitute an unreasonable cost on the part of a State acting extraterritorially? In exploring these questions, this paper offers insights from the author’s membership in the Drafting Committee of the 2011 Maastricht Principles on the <b>Extraterritorial</b> <b>Obligations</b> of States in the area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and presents the current state of legal play...|$|E
40|$|Experts ’ {{opinions}} differ {{whether to}} call the current surge in food prices yet another crisis. This does not alter {{the fact that the}} right to adequate food is one of the mostly violated human rights worldwide, with high food prices exacerbating the living situation of the world’s more than 900 million people going hungry every day. To guarantee the full realization of the right to adequate food for everyone {{is one of the biggest}} challenges ahead for the international community. Important new instruments to tackle the underlying violations of the right to ad-equate food and related rights have been developed recently. The FAO Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests point to the crucial role of natural resources as means to produce food. The Maastricht Principles on <b>Extraterritorial</b> <b>Obligations</b> respond to the fact that States have obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of persons outside of their territorial scope. The Committee on World Food Security is set to approve the first version of the living Global Strategic Framework on Food Security and Nutri-tion in October. In all this, it should be an inherent aim to overcome the disconnect between women’s rights and the right to adequate food, as explored by a team of research-ers from the University of Hohenheim.

40|$|Human rights {{violations}} occur daily, {{all over the}} world. Sovereign states legally bear the primary responsibility for human {{rights violations}}. But what happens when these states {{are not able to}} live up to their human rights obligations? Do other states have <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>obligations</b> to help them out? What role should other actors (such as companies or international organisations) play? This Programme starts from the assumption that human rights obligations, in particular in the field of economic, social and cultural rights, need to be re-thought in the present era of globalisation. The decentred position {{of the state and the}} increased power and impact of corporations and international organisations pose major practical and conceptual challenges to human rights law. In practice, human rights law faces a serious risk of marginalisation if it fails to adapt to this changing reality. Conceptually, the decentred place of the territorial state necessitates a fundamental re-thinking of a basic tenet of human rights law, i. e. that human rights obligations are primarily if not exclusively incumbent on the territorial state. The Programme intends to address a dual challenge, i. e. to deepen the understanding of human rights obligations of foreign states, and to bring together sub-fields of human rights study, i. e. on the human rights obligations of transnational corporations, international organisations and foreign states. Until now, research on the topic has mostly been done by individual researchers, and sometimes by relatively small research groups. Moreover, as this is a new field, most researchers are relatively young scientists. There has been insufficient critical mass and expertise available in any individual country of Europe to study transnational human rights obligations in all their complexity. The Programme will be instrumental in creating a real research community on the issue, in attracting new scholars to the field, and in bringing the topic into the mainstream of human rights scholarship. The running period of the ESF GLOTHRO Research Networking Programme is for four years, from May 2010 to May 2014...|$|E
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 310 - 370). The patent system {{exists to}} encourage {{the development of new}} products from which society will benefit. The strength of protection awarded to patented products is a policy decision, allowing states to balance the monopoly rights of patent-owners against the inherent social costs of monopoly protection. The effective policy space within which states may establish domestic patent policy is increasingly circumscribed by international rules prescribing minimum protection levels regardless of local circumstances or consequences. In international negotiations, developing states have attempted to resist policy space curtailment using arguments that rely on foundational principles of the intellectual property system: its public purpose and its commitment to balancing costs and benefits. This negotiating stance has not been effective; its opponents counterargue that stronger patent protection achieves the same ends. This dissertation examines the resulting circular discussions at the 2001 - 2003 Doha negotiations and the WIPO Development Agenda talks since 2004. I argue that the impasse stems from an inability to move beyond the costs-benefits tension inherent in the patent system. Economists have been unable to resolve this tension by identifying optimal protection levels. Furthermore, intellectual property theory is unable to provide a bottom line at which the short-term social costs of patent monopolies must be deemed unacceptable, regardless of anticipated longerterm benefits. The developing states' negotiating stance will be strengthened if a bottom line can be identified. I argue that the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights provides benchmarks to fulfil this function. ICESCR obligations are specific, objective, and measurable; they have international legitimacy; and they bind almost all states. I examine the Article 12 right to health to show that states violate the ICESCR if they ratify other treaties which reduce policy space and {{make it more difficult for}} states to adopt policies to meet their domestic or <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>obligations.</b> I also examine Article 15, concluding that it is insufficiently developed to offer firm guidelines. I use insights from international relations theory to examine the practical possibilities of adopting a human rights-based approach, and argue that the strategy will become progressively more effective as human rights norms are internalized through the negotiating process and by other means...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the role of}} home states in relation to extraterritorial human rights violations committed by their corporate nationals, more specifically transnational corporations (TNCs). This thesis examines the difficulties of holding TNCs directly accountable for the violations they commit. Secondly, this thesis explores whether {{and to what extent}} home states of TNCs can become responsible for extraterritorial human rights violations committed by TNCs domiciled in their territories. This thesis approaches the issue of home state responsibility from two separate points of view namely the law on state responsibility and international human rights law. Growing corporate power and its possible detrimental impact on the enjoyment of human rights has not gone unnoticed. TNCs’ corporate structures are as the name says, transnational, and their operations are commonly global. This in turn leads to {{a situation in which the}} operations of a TNC existing under the laws of one state may impact the lives of people located in other the countries hosting the operations of the TNC. Although some attempts have been made in the international legal sphere to keep corporations directly accountable for the human rights violations they commit, under the current state of international law, no legally binding provisions exist to keep corporations directly accountable. Focus has therefore been on states’ obligations to ensure the adequate protection of human rights and this thesis stresses the obligations of the home state. The two separate approaches to state responsibility examined in this thesis are built on very different premises. Firstly, the law of state responsibility provides the circumstances pursuant to which the acts of TNCs can become attributable to the home state as an act of state. As a general rule, private acts are not automatically imputable to the state, but may under certain circumstances be considered as such. This thesis explores the exemptions to this basic rule of non-attribution and the conditions when a state can be held responsible for the acts of TNCs. Pursuant to the rules of state responsibility, acts of TNCs may become attributable to the home state in four situations, namely when the TNC has the status of an organ of the state de facto or de jure; when the TNC has been authorized to exercise governmental authority; when the TNC has acted under the instructions, direction or control of the state and when the home state acknowledges and adopts the conduct as its own. However, as this thesis demonstrates the criteria for attribution of TNCs’ conduct to the state are rather strict and the practical usefulness of the law of state responsibility for the purposes of keeping home states responsible for human rights abuse is rather speculative. The second approach adopted in this thesis finds its basis in human rights law. It is widely acknowledged that states are under an obligation to respect, protect and fulfil human rights. Of these three aspects, the obligation to protect is central to this thesis as it concerns the state’s duty to protect human rights of individuals from infringements of non-state actors such as TNCs. The positive duties to protect human rights have traditionally been perceived to apply in the domestic territories of the state, and this thesis examines whether the home states of a TNC can be under an obligation to extend this protection to the human rights of people in third states and thus to control their corporate nationals by means of e. g. legislation. The recent developments in this field signal of a willingness to recognize and strengthen the duties of home states’ <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>obligations.</b> This is perhaps due to the fact that recent initiatives have on the one hand abandoned the idea of direct corporate accountability and relied solely on the permissibility of home state regulation, which is insufficient and gives rise to governance gaps. However, the work of various human rights treaty bodies signal of the possibility of recognizing such home state obligations and is also discussed in this thesis. 	 Conclusively, the discussion in this thesis provides that home states can incur state responsibility under certain rather strict conditions. The conclusions also highlight that of the two approaches addressed in this thesis, international human rights law is perhaps a better tool in this regard. Nevertheless, the existence of legally binding norms is still an unresolved matter. Therefore the conclusions of this thesis observe the need to clarify the precise scope of the <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>obligations</b> of home states with regard to control of TNCs...|$|E
40|$|An {{obligation}} to render assistance {{to those who}} are in distress at sea has long been recognized in international maritime law. Recent developments in international human rights law have also resulted in a greater understanding of states' <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>obligations</b> which have the capability to extend protection to migrants in distress at sea. These human rights obligations are most commonly defined by whether the relevant state exercises 'jurisdiction' over the area, person or event in question. When such jurisdiction is not present, states are relieved of any human rights obligations to take action or for injury caused by their inaction. Yet in many instances they will still feel compelled to act through some form of a latent moral obligation. Often this moral obligation arises out of a desire to assist and protect the world's most vulnerable populations. This paper will explore the dichotomy between these obligations with regard to the perilous position of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea. Specifically it seeks to find the dividing line between where a state's international legal obligations end and where their moral obligations commence. Through analysis of selected jurisprudence concerning the position of migrants at sea, decisions of the main human rights treaty monitoring bodies and with a particular focus on the European Court of Human Rights, this paper will attempt to identify the limits of a state's international legal obligations. Consideration will be given to when these obligations arise, how far they extend, what rights and protections are available under them {{and the extent to which}} there is room for further interpretation. The result of this will be an identification of the limits of law's promise in relation to migrants at sea. Beyond the reach of legal obligations lie loosely crafted moral obligations which compel states to assist those persons most in need. Influenced by global policy, security and economics, and characterized by inconsistency in practice, the limits of a state's moral obligations are vastly more uncertain. Through analysis of state efforts, actions and declarations this paper will therefore deconstruct a pattern for when a state's moral obligations will compel them to act with regard to migrants at sea. There exists a grey area between the international legal obligations incumbent on states and the actions which they are willing to take to fulfil their perceived moral obligations. As migrants at sea are most vulnerable within this disconnect a proposal will be made for how this gap can be bridged. The result of this analysis will be a clearer identification of the limits of law's promise in the Global North, particularly towards the most vulnerable populations leaving the Global South...|$|E
40|$|Die vorliegende Diplomarbeit behandelt die Frage, wie Rechte von Flüchtlingen im Kontext extraterritorialisierter Immigrationkontrollen aufrechterhalten werden können. In drei Teilen behandelt sie (1) theoretische Konzepte, (2) Entwicklung, Formen und Gründe, und (3) menschenrechtliche Implikationen extraterritorialer Immigrationskontrollen. Methodisch stützt sie sich auf strukturalistisch-konstruktivistische, politik- und klassisch rechtswissenschaftliche Elemente. Im ersten Teil wird argumentiert, dass Recht und Politik gegenseitig konstituierend wirken, was sich besonders in hochpolitisierten Feldern wie dem der Einwanderung zeigt. Eine „Überdeterminierung“ dieses Feldes, d. h. die Vielzahl und Widersprüchlichkeit seiner Normen, ermöglicht Staaten, ihre rechtlichen Verpflichtungen als streng auf ihr Staatsgebiet beschränkt zu interpretieren. Derzeitige Auffassungen von Grenzen und Souveränität fördern diese Interpretation. Die Diplomarbeit überdenkt daher diese Konzepte. Sie präsentiert die Grenze als entterritorialisiertes, individualisiertes Kontroll-Kontinuum statt als territoriale Linie; und Souveränität als den Anspruch auf legitime Macht statt ihrer faktische Verwirklichung. Im zweiten Teil wird Extraterritorialisierung statt als isolierten Trend als logisches Resultat dreier größerer Entwicklungen dargestellt: die Abschaffung EU-interner Grenzen; der Einflusserhalt intergouvernmentaler Akteure; und eine umfassende Sicherheitsstrategie. Darüber hinaus werden drei Formen extraterritorialer Immigrationskontrolle (Visa, Sanktionen gegen Beförderer, Einwanderungsverbindungsbeamte) diskutiert und ein Modell ihrer Beziehungen entwickelt. Zuletzt geht dieser Teil Gründen für die Extraterritorialisierung nach, wobei die Vermeidung extraterritorialer Verpflichtungen hier am wichtigsten scheint. Der dritte Teil der Diplomarbeit zeigt jedoch, dass Menschenrechte territoriale Grenzen überschreiten. Das non-refoulement-Prinzip findet Anwendung, sobald Staaten Jurisdiktion ausüben und gebietet den Schutz von Personen vor Verfolgung durch die effektive Bearbeitung ihrer Asylanträgen, was in der Regel Zugang zum staatlichen Territorium erfordert. Das Völkerrecht ist mit den Konzepten extraterritoriale Jurisdiktion, Schutzverantwortung und Staatenverantwortlichkeit prinzipiell gut ausgestattet, um diese Schlussfolgerung zu verteidigen. Um die Rechte von Flüchtlingen in extraterritorialen Situationen aufrechtzuerhalten, ist es daher in Summe nötig, (1) die Konzepte von Grenze und Souveränität neu zu definieren, (2) bestehende rechtliche Konzepte, die staatliche Kontrolle und Verantwortlichkeit aneinanderkoppeln, weiterzuentwickeln, und (3) Politikkonflikte, die bisherige Maßnahmen untergraben haben, aufzulösen. The present {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the question of how human rights of refugees can be upheld in situations of extraterritorialized immigration control. Its three main parts deal with (1) theoretical concepts, (2) development, forms and rationales, and (3) human rights implications of extraterritorial immigration control. It adopts a mixed-methods approach, drawing on structural-constructivist, political science as well as classic legal elements. The first part essentially argues that law and politics are mutually constitutive, something which is particularly obvious in highly politicized fields such as immigration. An ‘overdetermination’ of this field, i. e. the plurality and incompatibility of its norms, allows states to interpret legal obligations in a way that strictly limits them to their territory. Current conceptions of the border and sovereignty help them to do so. The thesis therefore revisits these concepts. It presents the border as a deterritorialized, individualized continuum of control, rather than a territorial line; and sovereignty as a claim to legitimate authority rather than its factual realization. The second part of the thesis illustrates that extraterritorialization was not an isolated trend within the EU context, but rather a quite logical result of three broader developments: the abolishment of the EU’s internal borders; efforts of intergovernmental actors to retain control; and a wider strategy of securitization. Furthermore, it discusses three forms of extraterritorial immigration control (visa, carrier sanctions and immigration liaison officers) and develops a model of their interrelations. Lastly, it traces the various rationales of extraterritorializing immigration control, of which avoiding <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>obligations</b> is found {{to be the most important}} one. The third part of the thesis demonstrates that human rights, however, transcend territorial boundaries. The principle of non-refoulement applies wherever states exercise jurisdiction and requires them to protect persons from persecution by effectively examining their asylum applications, which will normally require access to their territory. Furthermore, it claims that international law, providing for the concepts of extraterritorial jurisdiction, positive obligations and state responsibility, is in principle well-equipped to defend this conclusion. In sum, in order to uphold the human rights of refugees in extraterritorial situations we need to (1) redefine the concepts of border and sovereignty, (2) further existing legal concepts that re-link state control and responsibility, and (3) address policy conflicts that have so far impeded political action...|$|E
40|$|La tierra, su dominio, sus usos y aprovechamientos y cuanto a ella se vincula, en especial el acceso a los recursos hídricos 1, han sido de siempre uno de los afanes centrales de la Humanidad, modulando su propia Historia. Así lo he comprendido y, personalmente, me ha llevado a observar con respeto su evidente trascendencia, un respeto que enfatizo cuando se trata de quienes buscan su subsistencia -casi nunca fácil- aportándole sus energías y cuidados. Pero, {{aparte de}} ello, hasta ahora no ha sido objeto de mis investigaciones. Con todo, he de anotar que, de vez en cuando, entrar en conocimiento de algunas realidades me generaba inquietud. Así, los oligopolios creados a escala mundial respecto de las semillas 2 y los fertilizantes y herbicidas, y las consecuencias que conllevan 3. Y la muy alta concentración empresarial en el centro de las cadenas de suministro alimentario 4. También, el impacto de las políticas agrarias de los Países desarrollados sobre el Tercer Mundo 5, o el de la llamada ayuda o cooperación para el desarrollo 6, etc. La inquietud a que me refiero, en fin, ha dado paso a la marcada preocupación que me conduce a acercarme ahora a los crecientes problemas en los que, bajo el rótulo de acaparamiento de tierras o land grabbing, se están produciendo graves afectaciones de los Derechos Humanos, al ser éstos el objeto central de mis estudios, desde hace ya largos años 7. He de destacar que estas páginas responden a la {{necesidad}} que me ha surgido de tomar contacto con ese núcleo de problemas, que entiendo son de una gran complejidad 8 y requieren profunda elaboración y estudio interdisciplinario y, a ser posible, aportar algo a quienes, como yo, se encuentran en fases iniciales de indagación al respecto. Así, tras estas breves observaciones liminares, Ap. I, desarrollaré el presente trabajo exponiendo algunos aspectos generales, Ap. II, seguidos de la presentación del caso Mubende-Neumann, Ap. III, de un análisis de las llamadas obligaciones extraterritoriales, Ap. IV, y de su conclusión a través de unas reflexiones generales, Ap. V. Con todos los riesgos que conlleva la elección entre un nutrido elenco de casos en situación activa, he optado por el de referencia en la medida en la que, siempre a mi entender, resulta significativo y conforme al señalado propósito de estas páginas que, sin más, continúo llevando a cabo en el orden que ha quedado descrito. The dominion, use and exploitation {{of land and}} everything linked to it, {{especially with regard to}} access to water resources 1, have always been one of the main ambitions of the human race, with important effects on its history. This is how I have come to understand it and, personally, how it has led me to respectfully acknowledge its obvious importance, a respect that I emphasise when it comes to those who seek their subsistence – rarely easy – by contributing with their energy and care. Apart from this, however, to date it has not been the subject of my research. Yet, I must note that, from time to time, becoming more familiar with certain realities made me somewhat restless. This is the case of the oligopolies created around the world that deal with seeds 2 and fertilisers and herbicides, and the consequences deriving therefrom 3. And the same goes for the extremely high concentration of companies {{at the heart of the}} food supply chains 4. Furthermore, there is also the impact of the agricultural policies of the developed countries on those of the Third World 5 or the so-called aid or cooperation for development 6, etc. The restlessness I referred to earlier has now given way to a marked concern that leads me to approach the growing problems in which, under the label of land grabbing, are producing serious breaches of Human Rights, these having been the main aim of my studies for many years now 7. I must underscore the fact that these pages are a response to the need that has grown within me to make contact with those core issues, which I understand to be highly complex 8 and that require a deep examination and interdisciplinary study, and if possible that offer something to those who, like myself, find themselves in the initial phases of delving into the matter. Thus, following these brief preliminary observations (Subsection I), I will further develop the present work by outlining some general aspects (Subsection II), followed by the presentation of the Mubende-Neumann case (Subsection III) of an analysis of the so-called <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>obligations</b> (Subsection IV) and of its conclusion through some general considerations (Subsection V). With all the risks involved in choosing from such a wide range of cases in an active situation, I have opted for the case in reference due to the fact that, as I understand it, it is significant and in line with the aim of this work that I will now carry out in the order described here...|$|E
