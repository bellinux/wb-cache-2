40|$|A low {{friction}} tractor seat with nonlinear stiffness and <b>dead-band</b> damping was investigated both by simulation and experimentation. The {{objective was to}} determine if a practical, soft suspension system could be developed that offered improved vibration performance compared to a typical mechanical commercial tractor seat suspension. A hard damper was used to prevent end stop impacts that were more likely with the soft suspension. In addition the damper had a <b>dead-band</b> centered at the seat's static equilibrium position. The <b>dead-band</b> damping was achieved with a switchable damper using relative seat displacement as the control signal. The objective of the <b>dead-band</b> was to allow a soft undamped operating region that gave good vibration attenuation. If the relative seat displacement passed the <b>dead-band</b> limits due to sudden harsh inputs, the hard damping would take over and prevent end stop impacts. An experimental rig with nonlinear seat and switchable damping was built and tested with the same parameters and inputs as those used in the simulations. The simulation and experimental results compared well. Both the simulation and experimental results showed that a combination of nonlinear stiffness and <b>dead-band</b> damping used on a tractor seat gives reduced rms acceleration compared to a linear, conventionally damped seat...|$|E
40|$|The {{inclusion}} of the governor droop and <b>dead-band</b> in dynamic models helps to reproduce the measured frequency response accurately and is a key aspect of model validation. Often, accurate and detailed turbine-governor information are not available for various units in an area control centre. The uncertainty in the droop also arise from the nonlinearity due to the governor valves. The droop and deadband are required to tune the secondary frequency bias factors, and to determine the primary frequency reserve. Earlier research on droop estimation did not adequately {{take into account the}} effect of <b>dead-band</b> and other nonlinearities. In this paper, unscented Kalman filter is used in conjunction with continuously available measurements to estimate the governor droop and the <b>dead-band</b> width.

40|$|The {{dual active}} bridge (DAB) ‐based {{isolated}} bidirectional converter {{has been used}} to realize bidirectional energy flow while offering needed isolation between the primary and secondary side: for example, the battery side and grid side of one plug‐in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). Even though the operation of a DAB‐based DC–DC converter is straightforward, various transient processes exist, such as the <b>dead‐band</b> effect, which deeply affects the dynamic performance of the converter in real world applications. Compensation of this effect is not easy because of the strong nonlinearity of the entire system. This paper quantitatively analyzed the <b>dead‐band</b> effect at different output powers, and presented a model‐based controller to realize the nonlinear <b>dead‐band</b> compensation strategy, which can effectively mitigate demerits of the traditional PI‐based control strategy. The proposed control algorithm is validated through theoretical simulation and experimental results. © 2011 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|E

40|$|The {{connection}} of Distributed Generators (DGs) to a distribution network causes technical concerns for Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) which include power flow management, loss increase and voltage management problems. An Active Network Management System can provide {{monitoring and control}} of the distribution network as well as providing the infrastructure and technology for full integration of DGs into the distribution network. The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) method is a valuable tool in providing optimal control solutions for active network management system applications. The research presented here has concentrated on the development of a multi-objective OPF to provide power flow management, voltage control solutions and network optimisation strategies. The OPF has been shown to provide accurate solutions for variety of network topologies. It is possible to apply time-series of load and generation data to the OPF in a loop, generating optimal network solutions to maintain the network within thermal and voltage limits. The OPF incorporates not only the DG real power output maximisation, but also network loss minimisation as well as minimising the dispatch of DG reactive power. This investigation uses a direct Interior Point (IP) method as the solution methodology which is speed efficient and converges in polynomial time. Each objective function has been assigned a weighting factor, making it possible to favour one objective function and ignore the others. Contributions to enhance the performance of the IP OPF algorithm include a new generic barrier parameter formulation and a new swing bus formulation to model energy export/import in the main optimisation routine. A Terminal Voltage Regulator Mode (TVRM) and Power Factor Regulation Mode (PFRM) for DG were incorporated in the main optimisation routine. The main motivation is to compare these two decentralised DG control methods in terms of the achieving the maximum DG real power generation. The DG operation methods of TVRM and PFRM are compared with the optimisation results obtained from centralised dispatch in terms of the DG capacity achieved as it produces the optimum overall network solution. A suitable value of the droop and local voltage regulator <b>dead-bands</b> were determined for particular DGs. Furthermore, the effect of these decentralised DG control methods on distribution network losses are considered in a measure to assess the financial implications from a DNO's perspective.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{development}} of an autopilot system for leisure Yacht based on NMEA 2000 network and android platform. The developed system can operate both for manual steering and automatic navigation mode. In automatic steering mode, after manipulation of commands which are NMEA 0183 sentences by android platform, our system translates and sends the packets through NMEA 2000 network and the controller which is connected to NMEA 2000 network receives the commands and controls the boat?셲 rudder system automatically. The automatic steering mode will be achieved by cooperation of two controllersone for controlling the rudder system, and another for controlling the vessel?셲 heading. For this reason we have developed a PID controller with an adjustable <b>dead-band</b> gain and a supervisory controller inside <b>dead-band</b> area for the rudder system and a proportional controller to control the heading angle. The reason of using supervisory controller inside rudder controller?셲 <b>dead-band</b> block is to eliminate the steady-state error which occurs after applying <b>dead-band</b> block to the controller. This supervisory controller is an integral controller which specifically supervises the rudder?셲 behavior inside the <b>dead-band</b> area. In this study at the first stage we simulated our system in computer, and examined the proposed method?셲 feasibility. Next step was implementing the system on a real hydraulic steering model developed by us {{and at the end}} we finished the examination by implementing it on a real boat and doing test navigation.

In the apparent resistivity curves of some MT soundings, a V-shaped minimum appeared, centred on the <b>dead-band</b> frequency. This phenomenon turned out to originate from a strong artificial source and was not due to a downward bias of the robust processing techniques adopted.

40|$|Chronic {{myeloid leukemia}} (CML) {{is caused by}} a BCR-ABL {{chromosome}} translocation in a primitive hematopoietic stem cell. The number of hematopoietic stem cells in the body is thus a major factor in CML risk. Evidence suggests that the number of hematopoietic stem cells in the body is only loosely regulated, having a broad ‘‘dead-band’ ’ of physiologically ac-ceptable values. The existence of a <b>dead-band</b> is important, because it would imply that low levels of hematopoietic stem cell killing can be permanent; i. e., it would imply that low doses of ionizing radiation can cause permanent reductions in the total number of CML target cells and thus permanent reductions in the subsequent risk of spontaneous CML. Such reductions in risk could be substantial if hematopoietic stem cells are also hypersensitive to radiation killing at low dose. Our calculations indicate that, due to <b>dead-band</b> hematopoi-etic stem cell control, if hematopoietic stem cells are as hy-persensitive to killing at low doses as epithelial cells, reduc-tions in the spontaneous CML risk could exceed the low-dose risks of induced CML; i. e., the net lifetime CML risk coul...|$|E

The usual single hysteretic controlled half-bridge current dumping stage {{is replaced by}} two parallel buck converter stages, in a parallel voltage controlled topology. These operate independently: one buck converter sources current to assist the upper Class B output device, and a complementary converter sinks current to assist the lower device. This topology lends itself to a novel control approach of a <b>dead-band</b> at low power levels where neither class D amplifier assists, allowing the class B amplifier to supply the load without interference, ensuring high fidelity. A 20 W implementation demonstrates 85 % efficiency, with distortion below 0. 08 % measured across the full audio bandwidth at 15 W.

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the main}} hurdles {{standing}} in the way of optimal cleaning of cotton lint is the lack of sensing systems that can react fast enough to provide the control system with real-time information as to the level of trash contamination of the cotton lint. This research examines the use of programmable graphic processing units (GPU) as an alternative to the PC’s traditional use of the central processing unit (CPU). The use of the GPU, as an alternative computation platform, allowed for the machine vision system to gain a significant improvement in processing time. By improving the processing time, this research seeks to address the lack of availability of rapid trash sensing systems and thus alleviate a situation in which the current systems view the cotton lint either well before, or after, the cotton is cleaned. This extended lag/lead time that is currently imposed on the cotton trash cleaning control systems, is what is responsible for system operators utilizing a very large <b>dead-band</b> safety buffer in order to ensure that the cotton lint is not undercleaned. Unfortunately, the utilization of a large <b>dead-band</b> buffer results in the majority of the cotton lint being over-cleaned which in turn causes lint fiber-damage as well as significant losses of the valuable lint due to the excessive use of cleaning machinery.
