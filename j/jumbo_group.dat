50|$|In 2006, {{as part of}} <b>JUMBO</b> <b>Group’s</b> {{overseas}} expansion plans, {{its operations}} and processes were streamlined. A centralised kitchen was also set up in 2008 to ensure {{the consistency of the}} food quality across the various outlets and to facilitate the creation of new dishes. A food technology consultant was brought in to ensure that the Group’s famed dish, Chilli Crab, could be replicated in the Group’s overseas branch “without losing its flavour and texture” before the Group expanded overseas. Its first overseas restaurant opened in Shanghai, in November 2013. The centralised kitchen prepares the sauces and mixes to be delivered to the various outlets across Singapore. Located in Kaki Bukit and spanning 8,000 sq ft, the kitchen enabled the Group to cut down on work processes. The labour-saving initiative meant the company could expand with less new hires - including launching new establishments like Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine, JPOT Hotpot Singapore Style, and YOSHIMARU ramen bar. Through R&D at the centrailised kitchen, the Group also started selling their Chilli Crab and “Black Pepper Crab Paste retail packs to consumers.|$|R

The company also filed a proceeding against a floating restaurant named “Hong Kong JUMBO Seafood Restaurant” in Hong Kong due to the similarities to the JUMBO Seafood brand which created confusion among the general public. The case was won by JUMBO when they established that they had “built up goodwill on the name” since 1985.|$|E

50|$|The brand {{dates back}} to the 1950s when it was first started by Mr Ng Mui Song who {{operated}} a pushcart stall in the River Valley area catering to labourers. In 1977, Ng Mui Song’s son, Ng Ah Sio, moved to a stall in New World Amusement Park and worked out a new recipe, enhancing the pepper taste. The brand was eventually taken over by the <b>JUMBO</b> <b>Group</b> in 2010. After realising that many of its customers travelled long distances to its outlet at Rangoon Road, the Group opened an Ng Ah Sio Bak Kut Teh outlet at Tanjong Katong, showing its commitment to customer convenience and accessibility. The Katong outlet also opted to reflect the area’s Peranakan heritage with custom tile designs in a restored shophouse. Today it has 4 outlets.|$|E
5000|$|Marketing {{strategies}} of the Group include regular updates to the menu and a rewards programme for returning customers. Its famous dishes include JUMBO Chilli Crab and JUMBO Black Pepper Crab. [...] The Group prides itself on being market-driven, preferring to spend “time and effort to study opportunities rather than go on a “gut feel’”. Mr Ang {{and his team of}} chefs and managers travelled around Guangzhou and Hong Kong, “eating three meals of hotpot every day for a week” as part of market research when the JPOT hotpot restaurant concept was under development. [...] The company prioritises training and retaining staff, and nearly 100 staff members have been with them for over 10 years. [...] During the SARS outbreak, when business was poor, staff were offered the option of taking pay cuts instead of being [...] "retrenched". Staff are given more autonomy in their job scopes, and this “consultative leadership” style has resulted in a surplus of Singaporean staff under the quota system. The <b>JUMBO</b> <b>Group</b> is also accredited by the Singapore Workforce Development Authority and the Institute of Technical Education to conduct and develop training courses. It runs over 40 courses which are open to all staff and external parties, with courses ranging from language and service courses to JUMBO’s own LEAD programme for training middle management. Service staff at JUMBO who show leadership potential are shortlisted for a fast-track programme where they are trained for 18 months as supervisors.|$|E
