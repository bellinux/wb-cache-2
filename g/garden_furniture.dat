[...] "Humanity! I have none for you. My business is to burn, sink, and destroy. Your town is taken by storm. By the rules of war we ought to lay your village in ashes, and put its inhabitants to the sword. But I will spare your lives, though I mean to burn your houses." [...] Barrie did not follow through on his threat to burn houses, but he did secure a $14,000 bond on several incomplete vessels on the stocks in town. The terms required the completed vessels be delivered to the Royal Navy in Castine by November 1. In the end, the town estimated the value of its losses to total $44,000.|$|R

This is done to meet the market demands nowadays. PT Naga Bhuana Aneka Piranti is using mass production as the production system. Now, PT Naga Bhuana Aneka Piranti is producing folding chairs. To meet the demand, PT Naga Bhuana Aneka Piranti needs a finishing time that is suitable for the definite time. The problem that is faced by PT Naga Bhuana Aneka Piranti is the lateness time for finishing the folding chairs {{so that it does}} not meet the scheduled plan. The lateness in many departments makes finishing time unsuitable with the definite schedule. Because of the problem, PT Naga Bhuana Aneka Piranti should reduce the set-up time {{to solve the problem of}} lateness in finishing the folding chairs. Reducing set-up time can be done by using Single-Minute Exchange of Die (SMED) method. The SMED method separates set-up time activities to become two activities, which are internal set-up and external set-up. Internal set-up is an activity that is only done when the machines are not operated. External set-up is an activity that can only be done when the machine is being operated. By changing internal set-up to become external set-up, then the set-up activities that is done when the machine is stopped can be done when the machine is operated so the time for the set-up can be minimized. The result of data analysis shows that by the application of SMED method, the set-up time of the production of folding chairs for each station can be reduced up to 11. 23 minutes/ day. The set-up time for each station before SMED application was 67. 73 minutes/ day, and after SMED application, it can be reduced to 56. 5 minutes/ day. The time saving for the set-up can add the company income up to Rp. 6. 360. 000, 00 / month. Key words : SMED method, set-up time, external set-up, internal set-up...|$|R
