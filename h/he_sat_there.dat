500|$|Parlophone MD Tony Wadsworth was {{enthusiastic}} {{however as}} Coxon recalls, [...] "We played him [...] "Song 2" [...] {{as a bit}} of a test of whether he was on our wavelength. We told him this was the second single. Course, we had no idea that it would be. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> grinning—'Definitely! Definitely a single!'" ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Isaac Hempstead-Wright, who portrays Bran Stark in the series, Wright {{was asked about the}} significance of Bran witnessing the scene at the Tower of Joy, saying [...] "I don't think Bran knows why this is significant, but he knows that it is significant because he wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't earth-shattering, because everything we've learned so far during his visions has been pretty big and important, from the creation of the first White Walker to the origins of Hodor. This is clearly another important milestone in the history of Westeros. For Bran, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> sitting, 'This isn't my brother. This is my cousin somehow, but who's the dad? And why have I been shown this? If I find out who the dad is and why I need to know who the dad is, then let Jon know quick.'" [...] The scene reveals neither Lyanna Stark's son's name nor his father's, with the transition between the newborn's face and Jon Snow's visually conveying the identity. HBO released an infographic shortly after the episode aired, confirming Ned Stark as Jon's guardian, and Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen as his parents.|$|E
2500|$|Gunther {{had been}} {{asleep on the}} {{mainland}} across Humboldt Bay from the Island and had woken up to what he thought were screams, but went back to sleep. [...] The next morning he was awakened by the Justice of the Peace who went with Gunther to inspect the Island following reports that Indians had been killed. He was appalled by what he saw, recalling “ …what a sight presented itself to our eyes. Corpses lying all around, and all women and children, but two. Most of them had their skulls split. One old Indian, who {{looked to be a}} hundred years old, had his skull split, and still <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> shivering”. Gunther initially desired to bring the guilty to justice, but learned [...] "We soon found that we had better keep our mouths shut." ...|$|E

60|$|When <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>there</b> was a {{profound}} hush; then Bacon arose.|$|R

2500|$|Darwin paid a {{visit to}} his brother Erasmus's lady friend the {{literary}} Whig Miss Harriet Martineau who had strong views on egalitarianism and whose writings had popularised the ideas of Thomas Malthus. Around this time, she was writing her Society in America which included discussion of the geological [...] "process of world making" [...] that she had seen on her visit to the Niagara Falls. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> for almost an hour. [...] "She was very agreeable and managed to talk on a most wonderful number of subjects, considering the limited time. I was astonished to find how little ugly she is, but as it appears to me, she is overwhelmed with her own projects, her own thoughts and own abilities. Erasmus palliated all this, by maintaining one ought not to look at her as a woman." [...] In her autobiography, she later recalled Charles as being [...] "simple, childlike, painstaking, effective".|$|E
2500|$|... "She [...] called Bouzes {{suddenly}} {{into the}} woman's apartment {{as if to}} communicate to him something very important. Now there was a suite of rooms in the Palace, below the ground level, secure and a veritable labyrinth, so {{that it seemed to}} resemble Tartarus, where she usually kept in confinement those who had given offence. So Bouzes was hurled into this pit, and in that place he, a man sprung from a line of consuls, remained, forever unaware of time. For as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> in the darkness, he could [...] distinguish whether it was day or night, nor could he communicate with any other person. For the man who threw him his food for each day met him in silence, one as dumb as the other, as one beast meets another. And straightway it was supposed by all that he had died, but no one dared mention or recall him. But two years and four months later she was moved to pity and released the man, and he was seen by all as one who had returned from the dead. But thereafter he always suffered from weak sight and his whole body was sickly." ...|$|E
2500|$|...The three chiefs, {{who were}} at the head of all the bands of the Comanches roaming the frontiers of the {{settlements}} in Texas looked very dignified and grave. They differed much in appearance. [...] the political chief, was a small old man who in his dirty cotton jacket looked undistinguished and only his diplomatic crafty face marked him. The war chief, Santa Anna, presented an altogether different appearance. He was a powerfully built man with a benevolent and lively countenance. The third, Buffalo Hump, was the genuine, unadulterated picture of a North American Indian. Unlike the majority of his tribe, he scorned all European dress. The upper part of his body was naked. A buffalo hide was wound around his hips. Yellow copper rings decorated his arms and a string of beads hung from his neck. With his long, straight black hair hanging down, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> with the earnest (to the European almost apathetic) expression of countenance of the North American savage. He drew special attention to himself because in previous years he had distinguished himself for daring and bravery in many engagements with the Texans." ...|$|E
60|$|The cousin heated the bathroom, and the {{man went}} into it, but he neither washed nor rubbed himself, <b>he</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and waited.|$|R
60|$|The purple ebbed from Mr. Brewster's face. Such was his {{emotion that}} he had {{forgotten}} that infernal shop. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> down. <b>There</b> was more silence.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> still, held <b>there</b> by his materialized {{goddess of}} spring.|$|R
60|$|And {{then she}} told him, whilst <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> hunched and shuddering.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{the whole}} {{afternoon}} {{and went back}} to his hotel meek and very tired.|$|E
60|$|Hiram Van Decht, now {{a privileged}} {{person at the}} palace, came in to him as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Robert Roseboro {{was briefly}} {{questioned}} by police. When officer Harold Smith questioned him, Roseboro remained silent. [...] "He wouldn't answer. <b>He</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>there.</b> Roseboro´s silence {{made him more}} suspicious," [...] Smith said.|$|R
60|$|He {{was still}} in this {{attitude}} when Zuleika left him. The wind crooned over him confidentially, but <b>he</b> still <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> given up apparently to some posthumous enjoyment of his visitor's departing witticism.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> down, and <b>there</b> was a {{flutter of}} applause from the {{scattered}} {{audience in the}} gallery.|$|R
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> Herman came in, his keen eyes {{seeking out}} every stain and {{evidence}} of vandalism.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> till {{darkness}} {{came into}} his room. He did not replenish the coal in the stove that leered {{at him from the}} two broken doors in front, and seemed to face him with a crazy, drunken reel on its mis-matched legs. He was hungry, but <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> enjoying in a morbid way the pang of hunger. It helped him someway to bear the sting of his defeat.|$|E
60|$|So, torn by {{conflicting}} emotions, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> still, {{stiff and}} motionless {{in his seat}} as an Egyptian statue.|$|E
60|$|Alton's {{face was}} once more flushed, {{and the girl}} fancied his fingers quivered a little, but while <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> silent <b>there</b> was a tapping {{at the door and}} an urchin flung a journal into the room.|$|R
60|$|Dicky Weed {{tried to}} speak but couldn't, and <b>'e</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> with 'is face pale, staring at the pieces of 'is watch on the conjurer's table. Then the conjurer took a big pistol with a trumpet-shaped barrel out of 'is box, and arter putting in a charge o' powder picked up the pieces o' watch and rammed them in arter it. We could hear the broken bits grating agin the ramrod, and arter he 'ad loaded it 'e walked round {{and handed it to}} us to look at.|$|R
60|$|CUSINS. He doesn't now. <b>He</b> only <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and {{completed}} {{the wreck of}} my moral basis, the rout of my convictions, the purchase of my soul. He cares for you, Barbara. That is what makes him so dangerous to me.|$|R
60|$|Once {{more the}} morning light had come, and the burning agony of the hours of {{darkness}} was exchanged for the cold, crushing despair of the weary day. They had brought his breakfast, which he had loathed and left untasted. And then, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> so worn out with physical and mental exhaustion, something of a dull miserable apathy acted like opium on his wearied nerves and brain. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> thinking.|$|E
60|$|She stepped {{close up}} to him, and bending over him as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> crushed by realization, {{she lowered her}} voice.|$|E
60|$|With patient watchfulness <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{crouching}} {{over the}} fire for several hours, occasionally blowing it up or adding more fuel.|$|E
6000|$|Next morning Mr. Lind rose {{before his}} {{daughter}} was astir, and went to his club, where he breakfasted. He {{then went to the}} offices in Queen Victoria Street. Finding the board-room unoccupied, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>there,</b> and said to one of the clerks: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{rang the}} bell for {{something}} hot to drink. He would have nothing stronger than ale; and while it was being brought, and being warmed at the fire, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> thinking. <b>There</b> was a fine, massive gravity in his face, I did not venture to disturb.|$|R
60|$|At first Bremner {{watched the}} rising tide, and as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> up <b>there</b> {{in the dark}} he felt himself dreadfully forsaken and desolate, and began to comment on things in general to his dog, by way of {{inducing}} a more sociable and cheery state of mind.|$|R
60|$|He {{closed the}} bank as usual at five. Lincoln {{had not come}} couldn't come now till the nine-o'clock accommodation. For {{an hour after the}} shades were drawn <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> in the semidarkness, silently pondering on his situation. This {{attitude}} and deep quiet were unusual to him. He heard the feet of friends and neighbors passing the door as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> by the smoldering coal fire, in the growing darkness. There was something impressive in his attitude.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> a {{long time}} dreaming his career, {{faithful}} to the scut of his possessive instinct, warming himself even with its failures.|$|E
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> in gloomy thought, Barret chanced {{to raise}} his eyes, and {{observed}} the bird high above him--far out of gunshot.|$|E
6000|$|... "A great many, Lord Hampstead;--nearly all my life;--before {{you were}} born, Lord Hampstead."

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> {{with him}} <b>there</b> an hour; and then entered Mark's house again {{with his usual}} {{composed}} face, to find Mark and Mary sitting up in great anxiety.|$|R
60|$|Another half-hour <b>sat</b> <b>he</b> <b>there.</b> The {{thing was}} done by now, and this {{assurance}} seemed to quiet him a little.|$|R
