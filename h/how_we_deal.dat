500|$|As governor, Huntsman listed {{economic}} development, health-care reform, education, {{and energy}} security as his top priorities. He oversaw {{tax cuts and}} advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so {{that the government would}} not become overwhelmed by the state's fast growing population. He also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down. In 2007, when asked about a healthcare mandate, Huntsman said, [...] "I'm comfortable with a requirement – you can call it whatever you want, but at some point we're {{going to have to get}} serious about <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> with this issue".|$|E
500|$|Various interpretations {{have been}} {{suggested}} for the feather present at the opening and conclusion of the film. Sarah Lyall of The New York Times noted several suggestions made about the feather: [...] "Does the white feather symbolize the unbearable lightness of being? Forrest Gump's impaired intellect? The randomness of experience?" [...] Hanks interpreted the feather as: [...] "Our destiny is only defined by <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> with the chance elements to our life and that's kind of {{the embodiment of the}} feather as it comes in. Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications that are really huge." [...] Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: [...] "It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there. Was it planned or was it just perchance?" [...] Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: [...] "It can mean so many things to so many different people." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, Lundgren {{planned on}} playing a {{supporting}} role, {{with a more}} famous actor in the lead. He also considered directing the film, but decided against it, as he desired {{to learn more about}} producing. In 2013, Lundgren announced the casting of Tony Jaa, in the role of Tony Vitayakul; and Ekachai Uekrongtham as the director. Lundgren chose Uekrongtham after being impressed with his film, Beautiful Boxer. He contacted him through a mutual friend in Los Angeles, and in mid-2013, they arranged to meet in the city. While he had previously turned down scripts offered to him for international markets, Uekrongtham found Skin Trade [...] "riveting". He said the script [...] " [...] the potential to work as a character-driven piece while saying something about <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> with scars, literal and otherwise". Jaa, on the other hand, met with Lundgren through his manager and film agent. He couldn't speak any English when cast, but claimed to have taken [...] "intensive" [...] lessons in preparation for his role; stating he is now [...] "reasonably fluent" [...] in [...] "conversational" [...] English.|$|E

500|$|Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post {{called the}} episode [...] "deeply unsettling" [...] on purpose. She said that [...] "Violence against women was inescapable in this episode, but what made Mad Mens {{exploration}} of the topic worthwhile and compelling {{was the fact that}} two women in this episode asserted their power and control over their lives. It wasn't a story about helplessness and victimization; it was an episode about everything from sweaty discomfort to outright terror, and <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> with those emotions." [...] John Swansburg, writing for Slate, said the episode was a [...] "dud," [...] with the fever dream a [...] "very obvious (and not particularly enlightening) way to depict Don wrestling with his infidelity issues." [...] Jordan Bartel of the Baltimore Sun compared [...] "Mystery Date" [...] to a Stephen King novel. Meredith Blake of the Los Angeles Times admitted that the dream sequence was [...] "heavy-handed" [...] but that [...] "there’s also something terribly convincing about the link 'Mystery Date' posits between Don’s seemingly insatiable sexual appetite and his personal demons.

[...] Rolling Stone writer Sarene Leeds praised Christina Hendricks' performance and the dream sequence, asking [...] "even though it wasn't [...] "real," [...] what makes Don Draper any different from Richard Speck, the student-nurse murderer?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "No Surprises", {{recorded}} {{in a single}} take, is arranged with electric guitar (inspired by the Beach Boys' [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice"), acoustic guitar, glockenspiel and vocal harmonies. The band strove to replicate the mood of Louis Armstrong's 1968 recording of [...] "What a Wonderful World" [...] and the soul music of Marvin Gaye. Hoping to achieve a slower tempo than could be played well on their instruments, Godrich had the band record the song at a faster tempo, then slowed the playback for Yorke to overdub his vocals onto, creating an [...] "ethereal" [...] effect. Yorke identified {{the subject of the}} song as [...] "someone who's trying hard to keep it together but can't". The lyrics seem to portray a suicide or an unfulfilling life, and dissatisfaction with contemporary social and political order. Some lines refer to rural or suburban imagery. One of the key metaphors in the song is the opening line, [...] "a heart that's full up like a landfill"; according to Yorke, the song is a [...] "fucked-up nursery rhyme" [...] that [...] "stems from my unhealthy obsession {{of what to do with}} plastic boxes and plastic bottles... All this stuff is getting buried, the debris of our lives. It doesn't rot, it just stays there. That's <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>deal,</b> that's how I deal with stuff, I bury it." [...] The song's gentle mood contrasts sharply with its harsh lyrics; Steele said, [...] "even when the subject is suicide... O'Brien's guitar is as soothing as balm on a red-raw psyche, the song rendered like a bittersweet child's prayer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Affective {{emotions}} and response are a primary {{factor in the}} initial stages of infidelity on both sides. Affective behaviors are <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> emotions that we do not anticipate (Miller, 2017). An affective response immediately indicates to an individual whether something is pleasant or unpleasant and whether they decide to approach of avoid a situation (Miller, 2017). Jealousy is an automatic response when a partner is suspicious of another, and many don’t realize what is making them experience the jealousy because they have no evidence that they have been cheated on. Feeling of incompetence and later resentment can cause affective responses when a suspected unfaithful partner irritates or hurts the other’s feelings. Anger is an emotion that is in each of the stages of infidelity, but causes affective responses {{in the initial stages}}. It can spring from other more discrete emotions or can be felt from the suspected partner.|$|E

2500|$|To {{coincide}} {{with the release of}} Get Out, Peele curated a film series for the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) called The Art of the Social Thriller. The series featured classic horror films like [...] Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead, The Shining, The Silence of the Lambs, Candyman, The People Under the Stairs, and the first film of Wes Craven's Scream series. Peele also included films outside of the horror genre, such as psychological thrillers Funny Games and Misery, Hitchcock's mystery thriller Rear Window, and comedy-thriller The 'Burbs. The sneak preview of Get Out was preceded by the 1967 comedy-drama Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, the first Hollywood film to address interracial marriage and a big influence on the premise for Peele's own film. When asked about its inclusion in the series, Peele told the Village Voice, [...] "It’s not an actual thriller, it’s just a great exploration of the social phenomenon of <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> with race, putting it in a package that everyone can understand.
