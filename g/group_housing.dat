25|$|In 1997, Grampian Country Foods, {{then the}} UK’s largest pig producer, {{pointed out that}} pigmeat {{production}} costs in the UK were 44 p/kg higher than on the continent. Grampian stated that only 2 p/kg of {{this was due to}} the ban on stalls; the majority of the extra costs resulted from the then strength of sterling and the fact that at that time meat and bone meal had been banned in the UK but not on the continent. A study by the Meat and Livestock Commission in 1999, the year that the gestation crate ban came into force, found that moving from gestation crates, to <b>group</b> <b>housing</b> added just 1.6 pence to the cost of producing 1kg of pigmeat. French and Dutch studies show that even in the higher welfare <b>group</b> <b>housing</b> systems – ones giving more space and straw – a kg of pigmeat costs less than 2 pence more to produce than in gestation crates.|$|E
25|$|Small <b>Group</b> <b>Housing</b> (SGH) is {{an option}} for juniors and seniors on Goshen's campus. Started in the 1970s, SGH offers {{students}} the opportunity to live in a house arrangement, with common kitchen and living spaces. The purpose of SGH is for students to develop another living experience alternative to dormitory life. This same idea was carried out with the construction of the Apartments. Goshen College maintains that SGH living is a privilege, and students must apply as a group to live in a residence. An application board consisting of resident directors, spiritual life, and physical plant review all potential candidates in the spring for the next school year. Each group must create a housing plan, division of responsibility, show examples of volunteerism, and a commitment to better the Goshen campus, as well as resolve conflict. Other factors considered in the application process include house cumulative GPA, extracurricular involvement, median age of the group, and personal faculty recommendations. Houses are then rewarded to applying groups who exemplify high academic, moral, and volunteer efforts, based on objective and subjective review.|$|E
25|$|Since then, the {{decrease}} {{of the crime}} rate has encouraged entrepreneurs who plan {{to invest in the}} area. The Greater Jamaica Development Corporation (GJDC), the local business improvement district, acquired valuable real estate for sale to national chains in order to expand neighborhood commerce. As well they have completed underway proposals by allocating funds and providing loans to potential investors who have already established something in the area. One Jamaica Center is a mixed-use commercial complex that was built in 2002 by The Mattone <b>Group</b> <b>housing</b> Old Navy, Bally Total Fitness, Walgreens, Subway, Dunkin' Donuts, a 15-screen multiplex theater and for a while a Gap. Banking has also made a strong revival as Bank of America, Sterling National Bank, Chase Bank, and Carver Federal Savings Bank have each created at least one branch along various major streets: Jamaica Avenue, Parsons Boulevard, Merrick Boulevard, and Sutphin Boulevard. A $75 million deal between the developers, the Mattone Group and Ceruzzi Enterprises, and Home Depot cleared the way for a new location at 168th St. and Archer Ave. All approvals were obtained within three months of the application dates.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that sows in crates exhibit {{behavior}} such as bar-biting, head weaving, and tongue rolling.

They also show behavior that indicates learned helplessness, according to Morris, such as remaining passive when poked or when a bucket of water is thrown over them. [...] A review by the Scientific Veterinary Council of the European Commission states that repetitive [...] "stereotypical" [...] behavior has been found in [...] "every detailed study" [...] of pigs in gestation crates, but not in any other housing systems examined.

This study {{compared}} responses of mice in enriched {{physical and social}} conditions and in standard social conditions to wheel running, individual housing, and open-field test. The study divided into 6 groups, 48 female BALB/c mice <b>group</b> <b>housed</b> in enriched and standard conditions. On alternate days, the study exposed 2 groups to individual running wheel cages. It intermittently separated from their cage mates and <b>housed</b> individually 2 <b>groups</b> with no running wheels; 2 control groups remained in enriched or standard condition cages.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{continuous}} exposure to 80 % oxygen on newborn mice with Ureaplasma urealyticum pneumonia was determined. Mice were inoculated intranasally with either U. urealyticum or sterile broth and then housed in either 80 % oxygen or room air (21 % oxygen). The mice were sacrificed at either 7 or 14 days after inoculation. Significantly more mice in the U. urealyticum <b>group</b> <b>housed</b> in 80 % O 2 {{than in the}} room air-exposed group were culture positive 14 days after inoculation (P = 0. 042), but no difference was found at 7 days. The presence of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes and alveolar wall thickness were determined. Overall, the <b>group</b> <b>housed</b> in 80 % O 2 and inoculated with U. urealyticum had severe pulmonary lesions at both time points, while the lesion severity in the room air-exposed group inoculated with U. urealyticum and the <b>group</b> <b>housed</b> in 80 % O 2 and inoculated with sterile broth was dependent on the time point. Mortality was significantly higher in the <b>group</b> <b>housed</b> in 80 % O 2 and inoculated with U. urealyticum {{than it was in}} all other groups (P less than 0. 001).
