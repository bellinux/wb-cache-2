40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the Natural Resources Outreach Coalition (NROC) program is to provide {{education}} and outreach to communities in the NH Coastal Watersheds that {{are dealing with the}} effects of growth, and looking for ways to conserve open spaces and natural resources. Program objectives to meet this goal include: 1. NROC and client communities determine natural resource concerns of the communities. 2. NROC and client communities gather community information about these concerns 3. NROC develops and client communities host community presentations about natural resource-based planning. 4. Communities receive follow up technical and educational assistance as requested. In 2005, NROC worked with three new client communities (New Durham, Wakefield and Deerfield) to achieve the objectives outlined above. All three communities received NROC’s Dealing with Growth educational presentation, customized for each community, followed by a series of follow-up meetings in each community to address issues raised in the presentation and community concerns about growth and natural resources. At the same time, NROC continued to work with three previous NROC communities (Chester, Strafford and Candia). NROC worked with a total of six communities during the funding period. Our experiences with the NROC program led us to the following conclusions: a) All the program objectives were met b) The NROC approach of an initial education presentation for all boards and the public, followed by an intensive program of <b>follow-up</b> <b>assistance</b> over several months, continues to be a very effective strategy for mobilizing and motivating community leaders and volunteers to move forward and take action to protect priority land and water resources. The <b>follow-up</b> <b>assistance</b> and related activities are key {{to the success of the}} NROC program in a community. NROC’s revised <b>follow-up</b> <b>assistance</b> procedure, first implemented at the end of 2004, has been very successful, resulting in higher levels of volunteer recruitment and retention. This has also resulted in stronger and more focused follow-up programs developed by the participants c) Providing continued assistance to previous NROC communities has been valuable in helping those communities continue to move forward, and develop a strong and informed base of public support for natural resource-based planning. d) Having funds available for community projects has helped to motivate communities to take action on issues they have prioritized...|$|E

40|$|High-quality {{seedlings}} are {{a prerequisite}} for successful forestry and agroforestry expansion in developing countries. Unfortunately, in the central Philippines, as supplies of timber from native forest have diminished in recent years, the expansion in planting of timber trees has been retarded by sub-optimal production of seedlings from small-scale nurseries. To address this problem, an extension program supported by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) has attempted {{to improve the quality}} of seedlings produced in home nurseries, by assisting smallholders to raise and out-plant seedlings. A complementary program undertaken as part of the Community Agricultural Technology Program (CATP) has attempted to provide community workers and managers of small-scale nurseries with the benefit of recent ACIAR nursery research. Extended assistance in the ACIAR program addressed smallholders’ low self-efficacy in nursery technology and was successful in assisting them to grow high quality seedlings. A limited program of assistance was relatively unsuccessful. Evaluation of the CATP program showed that prior to the training, CATP participants were unfamiliar with some aspects of basic nursery technology. Consequently, they may have been unable to provide competent advice to smallholders. This implies that—as with the ACIAR training—extended training and <b>follow-up</b> <b>assistance</b> may be the key to improving the quality of seedlings for forestry and agroforestry expansion in the central Philippines...|$|E

40|$|The Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea are {{experiencing}} a severe shortage of firewood. Residual native forest and some plantation forestry are insufficient to supply this need. In response, in October 2014, the Papua New Guinea Forest Authority (PNG-FA) undertook a three-day training {{program in the}} township of Goroka. Farmers received training in nursery techniques including seed collection, preparing nursery beds, germinating seedlings and out-planting seedlings. Farmers were supplied with seed, shade-cloth and polybags {{to start their own}} home nurseries. Follow-up interviews found that nine of thirteen participants had raised seedlings. However, for those farmers living outside of the Goroka environs, problems have emerged. A severe shortage of seed has resulted in farmers using inappropriate Pinus species. In PNG, land is often community-owned but managed by individual farmers. Long-term tenure is therefore subject to negotiation between clan members. Technology sharing is also not common between clans. In the grasslands, fire is always a problem. These findings indicate a need for an approach to forest extension which accommodates a low rate of technology diffusion between clans and in which farmers in remote locations receive almost one-to-one <b>follow-up</b> extension <b>assistance</b> and access to seed, and guidance to inter-crop planting patterns which provide protection from fire...|$|R

Government-provided psychological and medical examinations were available for trafficking victims, but comprehensive victim services such as counseling, <b>follow-up</b> medical <b>assistance,</b> job training, and reintegration assistance were generally unavailable. The government operates a national hotline through which it receives trafficking complaints, and refers trafficking victims to NGOs for care. The government reported assisting 22 trafficking victims in 2007, in addition to collaborating with IOM to repatriate two Venezuelan victims who had been trafficked to Switzerland and Mexico. However, since the Venezuelan government does not have policy provisions in place to help protect against human trafficking of men, many of these resources only help women and children. The lack of a secure witness protection program discouraged some victims from assisting with the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers. According to NGOs, {{the government does not}} have a formal mechanism for identifying trafficking victims among prostituted persons in the nation's commercial sex trade.

40|$|Purpose/Objectives: To present {{findings}} {{on the impact of}} diagnosis and treatment on sexuality for those diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy. Research Approach: A qualitative design based on a series of open-ended interviews and one focus group. Setting: Queensland, Australia. Participants: 50 participants representing the major hematologic diagnostic groups. Methodologic Approach: Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and then coded and thematically analyzed for the research. Findings: The impact of the disease and treatment on sexuality ranged from participants experiencing no problems or having a brief impact that passes over time, to those who reported serious problems that significantly affected their life satisfaction. Some concerns were raised about the taboo nature of sexuality and the lack of discussion on the topic. Conclusions: The findings contradict prior research that all patients with cancer will experience an impact on their sexuality by diagnosis and treatment. The current study indicates that a small subgroup of individuals diagnosed with hematologic malignancies are acutely distressed about issues regarding sexuality and require follow-up. Interpretation: Individuals diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy may have difficulties with their sexuality and will, therefore, require <b>follow-up</b> or <b>assistance.</b> A subset of individuals will require understanding, support, and, for some, referral to follow-up with a specialist. As major obstacles still exist for patients accessing appropriate professional support and advice on sexuality, oncology nursing can provide leadership in this area.

Controls consisted of ventilation, clean engines, environmental cabs, alternative fuels, diesel particulate filters (DPF), and work practices. The focus of the <b>follow-up</b> compliance <b>assistance</b> visits was to assess control effectiveness and to make recommendations to mines experiencing difficulty in meeting the DPM standard. At each mine visited, the ventilation controls were evaluated, engine emissions were determined for equipment in use, environmental cabs were examined, and operational practices were noted. Additionally, control technologies, including alternative fuels and DPF, were evaluated in several mines. A comparison was made of mine and section airflow to equipment particulate indices. Based on engine emissions, horsepower, and operating time, the contribution of individual engine emissions to total emissions was made. Environmental cab integrity, positive pressure, and air filtration systems were checked and operational practices relating to DPM exposure were assessed.

Program adaptations that conserve staff time and resources and recognize their contribution can increase program effectiveness without jeopardizing its fidelity. </p...|$|R
40|$|The project {{provided}} {{assistance to}} the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Agrarian Reform and the Brazilian Organization of Cooperatives (OCB) in formulating proposals for restructuring rural savings and credit cooperatives and constituting an integrated cooperative credit system, {{as well as in}} assessing the viability of establishing a private rural cooperative bank. The original work programme was substantially modified and the project duration was extended by one year in view of the delays encountered in approving the required modifications in cooperative bank legislation and in completing the preparatory work for the new bank. The FAO international consultant carried out between 1991 and 1993 three missions, while two national consultants in the specialized fields of bank legislation and bank organization/operations were contracted from September 1992 to February 1993. The first mission of the FAO international consultant in the period from June to September 1991 coincided with and contributed to the work of an Inter- Ministerial Task Force which reviewed the current cooperative legislation and the regulatory framework of the cooperative credit system. Both the project and the Task Force have recommended that the current repressive regulations of credit cooperatives be lifted. They further emphasized the need for strong primary credit cooperative societies and their integration in central cooperatives as an essential pre-condition {{for the establishment of a}} viable private cooperative bank. In particular, it is recommended to terminate the monopoly of the Banco do Brazil with regard to the administration of surplus financial resources of cooperatives and the intermediation on behalf of the cooperatives in the National Clearing System of Checks. The concurrence of the Central Bank with the proposed modifications to Resolution No. 1914 was obtained already at the end of March 1993, but final approval is still awaited from the National Monetary Council. A <b>follow-up</b> technical <b>assistance</b> project proposal for the consolidation of an integrated system of credit cooperatives has also been formulated and will be effectuated once the new bank has been established and as soon as financial resources have been obtained. The proposal focuses on such key issues as training, adaptation of the credit cooperatives to the new regulations and requirements of capital adequacy, and improving the internal management and control capabilities at the three operational levels of primary credit cooperative societies, central credit cooperatives and the new cooperative bank. In particular, management and staff training will be very important over the next years in order to gain and maintain the confidence of cooperative members and clients alike...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic aortomyoplasty is an {{alternative}} technique to heart transplantation. The goal of our study was to evaluate the benefits of aortic counterpulsation obtained by dynamic aor-tomyoplasty in patients with heart failure refractory to pharmacological treatment and con-traindications to heart transplant or cardiomyoplasty. In this study we compared preoperative and postoperative data of selected patients submit-ted who were treated with dynamic thoracic aortomyoplasty. This surgical technique wrap the right latissimus dorsi muscle flap around the ascending aorta. This muscle flap was electrically stimulated during diastole, following a muscle-conditioning protocol, to obtain diastolic augmentation. At twelve months follow-up period we evaluated, invasively and noninvasively, the hemodynamic and clinical effects of aortomyoplasty. We observed {{a significant decrease in}} the number of hospitalizations (p< 0. 001), NYHA functional class (p< 0. 001), left atrial diameter (p< 0. 05), wedge pressure (p< 0. 05), left ven-tricular diameter (p< 0. 05) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (p< 0. 05); and a significant increase in the 6 -minute walking test (p< 0. 001), cardiac index (p< 0. 01), noninvasive eva-luation of diastolic augmentation (p= 0. 01), left ventricular shortening fraction (p< 0. 05), and radioisotopic left ventricular ejection fraction (p< 0. 05). We also found a non significant de-crease in peak oxygen consumption (p= 0. 05). This nine patients operated with aortomyoplasty was compared with sixteen patients treated with cardiomyoplasty at twelve months of <b>follow-up.</b> Dynamic biologic <b>assistance</b> with latissimus dorsi in heart failure, either aortomyoplasty or cardiomyoplasty in selected patients with severe heart failure, resulted in an important im-provement of hemodynamic parameters, heart functional data and clinical functional, without significant differences between the results of both techniques...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION : Access to ear {{and hearing}} health is a {{challenge}} in developing countries, where the burden of disabling hearing loss is greatest. This study investigated community-based identification of hearing loss using smartphone hearing screening (hearScreen™) operated by community health workers (CHWs) in terms of clinical efficacy and the reported experiences of CHWs. METHOD : The study comprised two phases. During phase one, 24 CHWs performed community-based hearing screening {{as part of their}} regular home visits over 12 weeks in an underserved community, using automated test protocols employed by the hearScreen™ smartphone application, operating on low-cost smartphones with calibrated headphones. During phase two, CHWs completed a questionnaire regarding their perceptions and experiences of the community-based screening programme. RESULTS : Data analysis was conducted on the results of 108 children (2 - 15 years) and 598 adults (16 - 85 years). Referral rates for children and adults were 12 % and 6. 5 % respectively. Noise exceeding permissible levels had a significant effect on screen results at 25 [*]dB at 1 [*]kHz (p< 0. 05). Age significantly affected adult referral rates (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), demonstrating a lower rate (4. 3 %) in younger as opposed to older adults (13. 2 %). CHWs were positive regarding the hearScreen™ solution in terms of usability, need for services, value to community members and time efficiency. CONCLUSION : Smartphone-based hearing screening allows CHWs to bring hearing health care to underserved communities at a primary care level. Active noise monitoring and data management features allow for quality control and remote monitoring for surveillance and <b>follow-up.</b> The financial <b>assistance</b> of the National Research Foundation (NRF) towards this research is hereby acknowledged.

40|$|The project {{provided}} follow-up {{support to}} the project "Reorganization of the Directorate General of Food and Strengthening National Food Security along with the Establishment of a Management Information System for the Directorate General of Food" which ended in December 1990. From January 1991 to June 1993, the project provided direct assistance to the Ministry of Food and the Directorate General of Food for reviewing and negotiating the organizational restructuring of the DGF, including the revision of the staffing structure. This ultimately led to the official endorsement of the reorganization structure which inter alia will reduce the total staff for the DGF by 3 000 from the existing level. Revised supply management and finance and accounts recording and reporting procedures were introduced throughout all installations and offices of the DGF and data collection and processing were computerized within the DGF management information system at headquarters, regional and port offices. The project also assisted with the design and development of a computerized least-cost routing model to minimize the costs of foodgrain movement and undertook {{a detailed analysis of}} the port handling operations of foodgrains in Chittagong and Khulna/Mongla. In addition, support was provided in the area of pest management and quality control. Although the project assisted with strengthening the overall managerial and operational performance of the DGF, considerable work remains to be carried out if the changes introduced are to be continued on a sustainable basis. Restructuring the DGF not only concerns the organizational changes themselves, but also requires a substantial amount of training and monitoring of managers at all levels who will have to adopt a different style and attitude to administer the affairs of the DGF. There has been wide recognition by MOF, DGF and the donor community that further support will be required to consolidate the reorganization process along these lines. A Technical Assistance Project Proforma (TAPP) has been prepared. It should be approved as a matter of urgency if the present momentum of the reorganization process is not to be lost. There is an immediate need to establish the DGF Implementation Team, comprising 5 DGF trainers previously working with the project, which will assume the overall responsibility for implementing the reorganization structure and monitoring the continued implementation of the revised systems and procedures introduced by the project until the requested <b>follow-up</b> technical <b>assistance</b> may become operational. While the implementation process will be ongoing, senior management will have to start paying special attention to ensuring that required changes in management style, working practices and attitude, including the delegation of authority to field managers and the adherence to a strict reporting discipline, are installed and sustained correctly. In this regard, it is extremely important that the DGF/MOF urgently provide official approval for the revised financial accounting system to ensure that the trial balance and related double entry bookkeeping system, which was introduced {{with the assistance of the}} project, is effectively sustained. In addition, approval is required for the introduction of the proposed budget and petty cash accounting systems to complete the full financial accounting system and enhance the accountability and financial monitoring capability of the DGF. Important is also that the DGF make appropriate budgetary allocations to sustain the overall development, operation and maintenance of the computerized MIS system, including the computerized finance and accounts system, the least-cost routing model, and the personnel data bank. In addition, attention is required to implement a number of the suggested improvements in the port handling operations of foodgrains, notably the adaptation of the tender documents for tendering Discharge Rates stipulated in Charter Parties, and the improvement of the utilization of Chittagong Silo. The privatization of the maintenance of vacuvators and pneumatic unloading equipment at Chittagong Silo jetty and the introduction of a bonus system for staff operating this equipment should also be considered. The eight technical officers trained as trainers in overall aspects of quality control and pest management should effectively be posted as Technical Officers at the regional offices and DGF headquarters in accordance with the revised staffing structure. ...|$|R
40|$|Imagine this: {{extension}} {{workers and}} technicians who {{go around the}} country in mobile offices equipped {{with a wide range of}} top-notch ICTs such as a global positioning system (GPS) device, digital cameras and laptops. With this equipment they have immediate access to vital agricultural information and can make recommendations to farmers on the spot. As a result, the technicians are able to spend 95 % of their time in the field instead of the office, providing direct technical assistance to farmers. This is not a distant future scenario, but is already happening in Honduras, where staff of the US-based agribusiness development consultancy Fintrac are working to increase sales of non-traditional horticultural produce and boost the incomes of smallholder farmers. It all started in 2000, when the USAID-funded Center for Developing Agribusiness (CDA) took on the task of revitalizing the Honduran non-traditional agricultural sector after the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch. Fintrac, which has a long track record in providing technical assistance in the Caribbean and Africa, was called upon to support farmers, food processors, exporters, and allied agribusinesses all along the farm-to-market chain. Its task is to manage knowledge, monitor and evaluate client farmers, disseminate technical information, and make market research data and information available to field technicians and clients. The programme collaborates with 500 ´lead partners´, and provides direct services to a further 5000 small farmers, focusing on improving production and post-harvest systems, market linkages, and infrastructure. To ensure the smooth operation of all the different information channels, the innovative use of ICTs has been decisive. While implementing the CDA programme in Honduras, Fintrac designed its own field-based management information system to provide real-time feedback from field staff on individual clients. The system is used to track technical <b>assistance</b> delivered, <b>follow-up</b> actions required, impacts and results, training, and investments. From their mobile offices, CDA´s field agronomists and other technicians enter this information into a database using a laptop, and submit it via the Internet for posting on Fintrac´s intranet. In addition to a laptop, CDA technicians also typically have at their disposal a GPS device, which is used to map farm boundaries, topography, and irrigation systems, as well as digital cameras, portable printers, cell phones, portable weather stations, and floppy disk drives. ´Technology is an important part of our work,´ says Andrew Medlicott, Fintrac´s Latin American Director. ´The information technology we use captures almost all of the activities and results in the field, based on which we can generate reports and data. The growers see the difference with the immediate delivery of analyses and recommendations. In most technical assistance programmes field staff record information and deliver it a week later after returning to their office. But a week is a long time in agriculture - it can mean the difference between profit and loss´. Fintrac has taken these ICT innovations and improved on them. In September 2003 the company launched new proprietary software, called the Client Impact and Results Information System (CIRIS), which has been designed specifically for agribusiness development programmes. The system´s reporting capabilities will enable an improved level of technical communication between Fintrac staff throughout Honduras and elsewhere. At the client level, not only will field technicians be able to access individual client data and <b>follow-up</b> technical <b>assistance</b> requirements, as is currently the case, they will also be able to view recommendations made by other field staff on a crop-specific basis across the world. With CIRIS, all Fintrac laptops will have fully replicated versions of the master database, so that field staff do not need to be online. This is critical if they are based in remote areas with only sporadic access to the Internet. On the programme management side, Fintrac project and home office supervisors, as well as donor staff, can access real-time reports online through the programme´s intranet. Along with extensive use of ICTs, Fintrac stresses the application of the latest and most affordable agricultural field technology. CDA technicians utilize basic agronomic equipment to assist growers in improving their production systems and in problem solving. It is the combination of effective ICTs along with the latest field equipment and production methods that have contributed to the success of the programme for the benefit of Honduran smallholder farmers. mailto:charlie@fintrac. com Charles Mahoney is a market analyst with the Fintrac CDA programme in Honduras.

40|$|The European Commission has {{recently}} extended its capability of connecting up {{research and policy}} conceiving at the Joint Research Centre in Ispra (Italy), with its recently established activity aimed at the set-up of an integrated and comprehensive cancer information system for Europe. The goal is to ease access and availability at European level of updated and reliable information on cancer burden – both for primary and recurrent cases, and on geographical patterns and temporal trends of incidence, mortality, prevalence and survival indicators, in order to drive health interventions and at a later stage enable evaluation of their effectiveness. To achieve the purpose a strong collaboration has been established between the JRC and the population-based cancer registries (CR) spread all over Europe, in their invaluable role of row data collectors; since 2013, the JRC is hosting the Secretariat of the European Network of Cancer Registries (ENCR), that is the scientific association embracing the over 150 European registries. In the European Union (EU- 28), according to the estimates of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), bladder cancer ranks fifth among the most frequently diagnosed cancers with about 124, 000 new cases predicted in 2012 for both sexes, representing around 5 % of all the incident cases. Among men, with 97, 000 new diagnoses estimated for 2012 bladder cancer represents around 7 % of all new cancers cases, ranking fourth after prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers. Among women, it is the thirteenth most frequently diagnosed tumour, with 27, 000 new cases per year, and representing around 2 % of all new cancer cases. For 2015, {{the overall number of}} estimated new cases is about 131, 000 (103, 000 men and 28, 000 women), and it is expected to grow up to 141, 000 in 2020. Within the European Union there is a huge variability in incidence rates, either among men – going from the age-adjusted rate (on the World standard population, ASR) of 31. 0 for Belgium to the lower level of 9. 2 for UK, as well as for women – ranging from 7. 4 for Hungary to 2. 5 for Cyprus. The epidemiology of bladder cancer is strictly related to that of its main risk factor: smoking. Therefore, the temporal trend of age standardized incidence rates has followed the changes in the prevalence of smokers of the populations. Indeed, in many countries there was a long standing increasing tendency (especially among men) in the past years, followed by a more recent decrease and/or a flattening of trends. As regards cancer mortality, in European Union bladder cancer represents the ninth cause of death, with around 40, 000 deaths (3 % of all the total cancer deaths) estimated in 2012 and nearly 43, 000 estimated for 2015. Mortality for bladder cancer decreases over time throughout in Europe among men, while it is stable or decreases among women. Approximately 324, 000 EU- 28 citizens are estimated with a bladder cancer diagnosis {{in the last five years}} (five-year prevalence); in other words, around 9 % (around 3, 700, 000) of all European citizens alive with a previous (5 -year) cancer diagnosis were having bladder cancer. They represent the burden for clinical <b>follow-up</b> and <b>assistance</b> for the European urologists and the EU- 28 health systems. As regards survival measures, the Eurocare project has compared cancer survival data among European countries since decades, and currently its 6 th edition benefits from a fruitful collaboration and coordination with the ENCR-JRC project. The most recent data of the Eurocare project (Eurocare- 5) showed that the 5 -year relative survival for bladder cancers diagnosed in 2000 - 2007 is on average around 69 % (Marcos-Gracera et al. Eur J Cancer 2015), varying from 75 % in Northern to 65 % in Eastern Europe. Some of the differences are presumably related to the stage at diagnosis. In fact, after one year since diagnosis the probability to survive additional 5 years not only improves substantially – it is on average 81 %, but also geographical differences decrease from 85 % in Southern to 80 % in Central Europe, because the death of more advanced cases made the case series more homogeneous. Finally, and differently from many other tumors, bladder cancer survival is higher for men (European age-standardized 5 -year relative survival 69 %) than for women (66 %). Bladder cancer registration represents a challenge for CR staff due to its complex biology that includes both non-invasive and invasive tumors, the use of different grade and stage definitions; moreover, this cancer is typically characterized by multifocal onsets and recurrences. Therefore, comparable and reliable information at EU- 28 level implies availability and correct application of common classifications and rules, in order to to assure throughout the collection of data on equivalent lesions. Indeed, the inclusion or exclusion of non-invasive papillary or flat tumors may sensibly affect either incidence and survival estimates, making comparisons unreliable, and actually ENCR recommendations to European cancer registries claim for a full registration (all histological type and stages) of bladder tumors. In this action of support and harmonization to registries the ongoing collaboration between the Joint Research Centre and the European Network of Cancer Registries is vital as well as good coordination with urologists and oncologists, to translate all those relevant scientific innovations possibly affecting data collection.
