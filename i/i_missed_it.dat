[...] He was raised to follow role players like Mario Tremblay, Guy Carbonneau and Bob Gainey rather than stars such as Guy Lafleur or Wayne Gretzky. [...] Bégin has played the majority of his career as a grinder, willing to play a physical game. His style often results in bruises and injuries, a part of the game he relishes. [...] Speaking of his comeback with the Flames in 2013, he noted: [...] "What I missed the most was the pain of playing hockey. The pain from blocking shots, getting hit, hitting people... <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it</b> a lot." [...] That attitude impressed his coaches; Bob Hartley argued that players like Bégin are a valuable commodity: [...] "Players with the commitment of Steve Begin, I really believe that there’s not enough (of them) in the NHL. [...] I always admired the way that he played. I look at the spirit, the leadership. Pretty amazing what he’s done for us." ...|$|E

I suppose Plenty really began in the woods outside Gainesville, Florida. ” ...|$|E
2500|$|Nobilo {{was born}} in Auckland, of Croatian and Italian descent, and is the great {{grandson}} of an Italian pirate. At birth, his right leg was shorter than his left, which has caused him some back problems throughout his life. He was educated at St Peter's College in Auckland where he was persuaded to play golf by schoolmates (Chris Treen and Mark Lewis). Nobilo preferred to play Rugby League for Glenora over Rugby Union for St Peter's, which was [...] "a bone of contention" [...] with the school. [...] "I got a bit of grief because I preferred league over rugby then and I was {{a bit more of}} a rebel. I used to catch the train to and from school and it took about 30–40 minutes. My mum said it drove her crazy because <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it</b> often and my parents were living in Glen Eden and I would end up in Henderson and they'd have to come and collect me".|$|E

2500|$|On February 2, 2000, George W. Bush, as {{candidate}} for President, spoke during school's chapel hour. Bush gave a standard stump speech making no specific {{reference to the}} university. His political opponents quickly noted his non-mention of the university's ban on interracial dating. During the Michigan primary, Bush was also criticized for not stating {{his opposition to the}} university's anti-Catholicism. (The John McCain campaign targeted Catholics with a [...] "Catholic Voter Alert," [...] phone calls reminding voters of Bush's visit to BJU.) Bush denied that he either knew of or approved what he regarded as BJU's intolerant policies. On February 26, Bush issued a formal letter of apology to Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor of New York for failing to denounce Bob Jones University's history of anti-Catholic statements. At a news conference following the letter's release, Bush said, [...] "I make no excuses. I had an opportunity and <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it.</b> I regret that....I wish I had gotten up then and seized the moment to set a tone, a tone that I had set in Texas, a positive and inclusive tone." [...] Also during the 2000 Republican primary campaign in South Carolina, Richard Hand, a BJU professor, spread a false e-mail rumor that John McCain had fathered an illegitimate child. (The McCains have an adopted daughter from Bangladesh, and later push polling also implied that the child was biracial.) ...|$|E

60|$|We {{lived here}} very easy and quiet, and yet I cannot say I was so in my mind; I {{was like a}} fish out of water.

60|$|The car {{was going}} faster now. I tried {{to jump on}} to the step, but the first time <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it.</b> Then the window was {{suddenly}} let down. The Chinaman's arm flashed out and struck me on the chest, so that I was forced to relinquish my grasp of the handle. I reeled back, preserving my balance only by a desperate effort. Before I could start in pursuit, the car had turned into the more crowded thoroughfare, and when I reached the spot where it had disappeared a few seconds later, it was lost amongst the stream of vehicles.|$|E
50|$|My War Gone By, <b>I</b> <b>Miss</b> <b>It</b> So, is a noted book {{based on}} his {{experiences}} in Bosnia and Chechnya.

In the book Loyd staggers chapters about war in Bosnia, Chechnya, and boredom tinged with heroin addiction in London.|$|R

60|$|Copple was so {{interesting}} that I must {{have passed the}} place where R.C. and I had come down into the canyon; at any rate <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it,</b> and we went on farther. Copple showed me old bear sign, an old wolf track, and then fresh turkey tracks. The latter reminded me that we were out hunting. I could carry a deadly rifle in my hands, yet dream dreams of flower-decked Elysian fields. We climbed a wooded bench or low step of the canyon slope, and though Copple and I were side by side I saw two turkeys before he did. They were running swiftly up hill. I took a snap shot at the lower one, but missed. My bullet struck low, upsetting him. Both of them disappeared.|$|E
