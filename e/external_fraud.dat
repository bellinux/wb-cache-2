40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the types, causes, distresses and {{mitigations}} of bank fraud. From the findings of this study, it can be concluded that the purpose of the study are met. The summary of the findings are as follows: 1. Types of fraud in the bank are categorised into <b>external</b> and internal <b>fraud.</b> 2. The causes of the occurrence of frauds in the bank that were found in this study are mainly due to violation of standard operating procedures, breach of dual control, lack of monitoring and supervision from the superior, negligence act and dishonesty of the employees. 3. Due to the fraud, the distresses that were found in this study and suffered by the bank are not only in terms of financial loss and non-financial loss. 4. The internal control systems of the bank are found to be able to detect fraud and can be considered as effective but there is still a loophole in the system that the bank needs to address. From the above findings, the recommendations for this study are as below: 1. Provides training to employees to instil fraud awareness culture. 2. Conducting fraud awareness campaign and fraud alert. 3. Provide training on good ethics. 4. Perform anti-fraud control gap analysis. 5. Improve the internal control systems of the bank. 6.

40|$|AbstractThe auditor's {{accuracy}} in conducting fraud risk assessment {{continues to be}} the most critical task. The reason is the effectiveness and efficiency of an audit depends on auditor's ability to accurately assess the existing audit risks (Jones, 2004). Applying to that, Malaysian Approved Standards on Auditing AI 240 on “Fraud and Error”, provides recommendation to auditors in assessing the client's likelihood of fraud risks based on the three elements of fraud triangle concept; opportunity, pressure and rationalization. Ideally, this audit standard highlighted the importance of auditors’ to evaluate these elements as it will assist them to understand their clients’ fraud reasoning motives and thus, properly assess the potential fraud risks that might be occurred. Based on the risk assessment, the auditors are required to plan the audit procedures in order to detect any material misstatement that may lead to fraud or error. In this study, as established in the ISA 240, the fraud triangle concept has been used to examine the direct and interaction effect of the following fraud risk factors: (1) internal control system (opportunity); (2) pressure and; (3) type of auditors (internal and <b>external</b> auditors) on <b>fraud</b> risk assessment. An experimental research approach is adopted by sending a set of case scenarios to 129 auditors, comprises of both internal and external auditors. The respondents were required to complete two different case scenarios, where the level of internal controls and pressures were being manipulated; high and low. The results showed that there are significant relationships between each risk factors and fraud risk assessment. Furthermore, the results of the interaction effects (combination of two variables) also show significant effect on fraud risk assessment. The findings of this study may provide insights into the auditors’ judgment in assessing fraud risk. It is also could be beneficial to the auditors to increase their awareness of the importance to understand their client's fraud motives during fraud risk assessment task and thus, improve the audit quality...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how Certified Public Accounting (CPA) firms approach forensic accounting in their organizational structure and hiring practices. Its {{purpose is to}} find how and why <b>external</b> auditors form <b>fraud</b> divisions and what credentials are needed to work in this field. It studies the fraud auditing or forensic accounting divisions within the Big Five accounting firms KPMG, Arthur Andersen, Deloitte &Touche, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, and Ernst &Young. This paper provides those interested {{in the field of}} fraud and public accounting an overview of how the organizations incorporate fraud divisions within their regular external auditing practice. Further, it provides insight as to the types of skills, experience, and other qualifications that are necessary to work in this field of accounting. The research conclusions are limited to the Big Five fraud audit or forensic accounting divisions as this group of five firms is unique to the public accounting industry and are not always representative of all public accounting firms. In addition, the method of interviewing representatives ofthe firm also limits the paper, as interviewees may try to present facts with the most positive interpretation. The research was conducted through reviews of the five firm's websites to obtain facts and information about the firm's practice and by interviews with representatives of the firm's fraud divisions. Overall, the five public accounting firms studied KPMG, Arthur Andersen, De 10 itte & Touche, Ernst & Young, and PriceWaterhouseCoopers approach forensic accounting very similarly. These firms all set up fraud divisions separate from their fundamental audit practices and used the same advancement levels of staff, senior, manager, and partner within the divisions {{to determine the extent of}} work performed by an individual.

40|$|Purpose – The primary {{research}} question {{of this study}} is to what extent auditors comply with auditing standards once they encounter fraud and whether compliance is associated with particular fraud characteristics (i. e. material versus immaterial fraud, management versus employee fraud, statutory versus voluntary audit and <b>external</b> versus internal <b>fraud)</b> as well as with auditor (experience) and audit firm characteristics (Big Four versus non-Big Four). The study also aims to provide evidence on the role of auditors in redressing fraud. Redress refers to the auditee taking measures to nullify the consequences of the fraud, insofar as possible, and to prevent any recurrence of such fraud. Design/methodology/approach – To gather data on the role of auditors in fraud cases, a survey was conducted among all audit partners of the top 30 Dutch audit firms. In total, 1, 218 audit partners were selected and received a postal questionnaire. In total, 326 questionnaires were returned (27 per cent), of which 296 (24 per cent) were usable. Findings – The results reveal that auditors fail to comply with some important elements of fraud standards. There are substantial differences among audit firms regarding compliance with the relevant auditing standards. Furthermore, auditors appear to encounter corporate fraud only incidentally. About half of the auditors believe they have a “significant” impact on redressing fraud. Research limitations/implications – One of the main research findings is that it is difficult for individual auditors to build up expertise in fraud detection. There appears to be a need for specific training programs for auditors to help them to detect fraud, emphasizing the need for mandatory consultation with the technical department of the audit firm once “red flags” indicating fraud are found. Indeed, this need for change has been addressed by the Dutch professional accountancy body NIVRA as a direct result of the findings of this study. Originality/value – This study extends existing research by investigating the compliance of auditors with fraud standards and it sheds light on the actual redress experiences of auditors. It focuses on the actions taken by auditors – or the lack thereof – in situations where auditors encounter fraud signals. The study indicates that in the absence of good oversight, auditors have mixed incentives when they are confronted with signals for fraud, resulting in actions that are not always in line with existing regulatory requirements.

40|$|Fraud is an {{inevitable}} {{cost of doing}} business. Organisations are responding to the pervasiveness of fraud by employing increased fraud risk management strategies. Internal audit {{is the most effective}} corporate control available to management to address the threat of fraud. Internal audit as an effective corporate control is studied {{in the context of the}} mandatory obligation imposed by The Institute of Internal Auditors’ 2009 International Professional Practices Framework (hereafter, IPPF). This mandatory obligation requires the internal audit function to ‘evaluate the potential for the occurrence of fraud and [to evaluate] how the organisation manages fraud risk’ (IPPF performance standard 2120. A 2 Risk Management). At the individual auditor level, the internal auditor is required to ‘possess the knowledge, skills, and other competencies to perform their individual responsibilities’ (IPPF attribute standard 1210 Proficiency). These standards have the potential to increase expectations on the internal audit profession to prevent and detect the threat of fraud. This expectations gap raises two research questions: (1) What are the determinants of auditors’ fraud detection capabilities? and (2) What constitutes expert performance in the fraud detection task? This thesis aims to address these research questions through the performance of two studies. Study 1 used interviews to investigate the determinants of fraud detection capabilities of both the external auditor and internal auditor. Study 2 drew on the results from Study 1 and was an online survey of Australian internal audit practitioners. Study 1 confirmed that the determinants of auditor expert performance in other audit tasks established in literature, namely, certification, continuous learning, practical experience, analytical reasoning, data analysis skills, communication skills, are also applicable to the fraud detection task. Further, the fraud detection task requires key, unique capabilities because fraud has an inherent element of deception and concealment by fraud perpetrators. The determinants of auditor expert performance unique to the fraud detection task include mentoring, technical skills, and the ability to work in a team. An additional finding is the identification of an effective control environment as a determinant related to the environment where the auditor performs audit work. The resulting model of auditor expert performance in fraud detection depicts the relationship of these determinants (independent variables) with expert performance in fraud detection (the dependent variable). The inclusion of new determinants and the revision of the definitions of determinants established in literature provided the solution to Research Question 1. Subsequently, auditor expert performance in fraud detection was defined based on the resulting combination of determinants. This was the solution to Research Question 2. Study 2 was an online survey with new scales of measurement that were developed from Study 1 interview data. Expert studies and pilot studies were conducted to validate these new scales of measurement. The online survey captured the perceptions of Australian internal audit practitioners about the determinants identified in Study 1. The survey data was applied to the model of auditor expert performance in fraud detection. The main findings of this study are: (1) the assessment of the effectiveness of the strategies to develop auditors’ knowledge of fraud and fraud detection - mentoring, practical experience, continuous learning, and certification; (2) the assessment of the effectiveness of each determinant in contributing towards auditor expert performance in fraud detection. The findings of this thesis supported the expectation that the uniqueness of the fraud detection task impacted on the composition of auditors’ fraud detection capabilities and subsequently, the composition and definition of auditor expert performance in fraud detection. The participation of practitioners – internal auditors, <b>external</b> auditors, and <b>fraud</b> investigators - and academics in the data collection and validation processes provided valuable insight into the research design and provided helpful data for the two studies. The main contribution of this thesis is the extension of Bonner and Lewis’ (1990) model of auditor expert performance to the fraud detection task. Next, the resulting model of auditor expert performance in fraud detection provides the internal audit profession, organisations, and the individual internal auditor with an understanding of the factors that impact on the individual internal auditor’s fraud detection capabilities. Therefore, this practical understanding of internal auditors’ fraud detection capabilities has the potential to: (1) contribute to the development and improvement of an organisation’s fraud risk management strategy; (2) inform the policy debate regarding the promulgation of professional and mandatory standards; and (3) contribute to auditing practice and the audit profession through the identification of strategies to educate the audit profession about fraud detection. The final contribution is the research design where the qualitative study (Study 1) contributed to the development of the survey instrument and provided insights into the results of the structural mode (Study 2) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe main {{incentive}} for fraudsters is in yielding the monetary gain – of which making banking institutions more fraud-fragile {{as these are}} where bulk of the money are kept. Banking institutions {{are becoming more and}} more susceptible to fraud over the years although various control measures have been put in place. Fraudsters are now more versatile in designing their modus operandi to circumvent the controls. The fraudsters could originate from both internal (employees) and external sources (customers, supplier, contractor, and lawyer). As banking institutions engage in wide range of activities, fraud could potentially affect many parties, including the shareholders, the depositors, the borrowers, the staff as well as the banking institution itself. A study was conducted among management levels in banking institutions in Malaysia, with focus on branch managers and assistant managers that handle the mortgage loan and hire purchase loan, to examine the types and extent of fraud occurrences in the portfolio of mortgage loans and hire purchase loans. Results show that in general, the most common fraud cases in branches that handled mortgage was money laundering, whereas for branches that handle hire purchase loan which were a common fraud occurrence in the banking sector of Malaysia.

40|$|While {{the volume}} and rate of {{individual}} crime types has fluctuated {{over the past few}} years, overall, crime in Australia has been decreasing. This report uses information compiled from a broad range of sources to create an accurate and holistic picture of crime and criminal justice issues in Australia. Within this volume are the patterns and trends relating to specific crimes, victims, offenders, the location of criminal acts, and the operation and cost {{of the criminal justice system}} (including the police, courts and prisons). The purpose of this publication is to provide government and justice agencies, the media and the Australian public with accurate, easy to access crime statistics in a single, centralised location. In the previous edition of Australian Crime: Facts & Figures, a new chapter was introduced with an aim to provide data around a crime and justice issue of importance for that year. This year, that chapter focuses on the relationship between alcohol and other drugs, and offending (see Chapter 8). While information on the involvement of alcohol and other drugs in physical assaults is presented, the statistics also highlight the serious drug and alcohol problem affecting prisoners in Australia. Highlights: 	The number of recorded victims of sexual assault and robbery has decreased. Robbery decreased by seven percent from 14, 582 in 2009 – 10 to 13, 617 in 2010 – 11, while there was a three percent decrease in victims of sexual assault with 17, 238 victims, 519 fewer victims than the previous year. However, in 2010 – 11, there were 67 more recorded victims of kidnapping and abduction. There were 14 more recorded victims of homicide than in 2009 – 10 however the rate remained at historically low levels at 1. 2 per 100, 000. 	In line with previous years, there were significantly more victims of property crime compared with violent crime in 2010 – 11. Further, the number of victims of property crime increased across all categories. Specifically, unlawful entry with intent and motor vehicle theft both increased by one percent, while other theft increased by seven percent. 	In 2010 – 11, $ 78, 840 was spent on prisons in Australia compared with $ 7, 300 for community-based corrections. In terms of ratios of dollars spent, for every $ 1 spent per offender per day in community corrections, $ 11 was spent on offenders in prison. 	Offending rates were highest for both males and females aged 15 – 19 years. Within this age category, most violent offending peaked around 17 years of age. However, the rate of sexual assault offending by 15 year olds (64 per 100, 000) was greater than that of 17 year olds (56 per 100, 000). 	Detainees (ie alleged offenders) who tested positive to heroin, alcohol and methamphetamine were more likely to attribute their violent criminal offending to their use of the drug than detainees who tested positive to cannabis, cocaine or ecstasy. 	Until recently, property crime occurred most frequently in domestic settings. However, since 2009, the most common location for property crime has been retail locations. 	<b>External</b> <b>fraud</b> was the most common category of fraud committed against the Commonwealth in 2009 - 10. Specifically, there were 702, 941 incidents of <b>external</b> <b>fraud,</b> costing an average $ 705 per incident. 	Non-custodial monetary orders were the most common sentences handed down in Magistrates’ courts in 2010 – 11. Conversely, the proportion of defendants found guilty in the higher courts who received a custodial sentence was far greater than those who received a non-custodial sentence...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of cases motivated by fraud {{is becoming more}} prevalent in companies with weak internal control policies and security vulnerabilities. On one hand, internal fraud is usually carried out by top management or accounting positions which have higher privileges, and thus, more capabilities in the system to commit fraud. On the other hand, <b>external</b> <b>fraud</b> is managed by hackers who {{gain access to the}} internal information system through stealing employee credentials. This project presents a solution to prevent fraud in companies. This proposal consists in controlling and managing user’s authorizations through an Access Control principle: Segregation of Duties. Following this security philosophy, it is defined a role based architecture. Furthermore, a detailed process on Segregation of Duties is carried out from a risk-based approach. Conflicts among critical tasks lead to significant risks in the system. Those risks become the core of the study. With an emphasis on risk management lifecycle, it is described every phase developed for achieving an implementation that complies with Segregation of Duties. Based on the design proposed, it is depicted the methodology of a project, by using a tool that integrates and streamline risks, compliance, corporate governance and access control policies, which is SAP GRC Access Control. Taking into consideration the security measures defined, costs of its implementation were calculated to be compared with the great losses occasioned by fraud and data breaches. The results showed that the percentage invested in security is almost imperceptible, ranging from 0. 002 % to 0. 7 % of the economic losses that fraud involves. Finally, from the results presented and the methodology of the project performed, conclusions and recommendations are presented for enterprises to avoid fraud, through its detection and control.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} {{of this study is}} firstly to analyse the Fraud Prevention Policy and Strategy, the Policy on Protection of Whistle-Blowers, and the Policy Document on Forensic Audit Process of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in order to {{establish}} the reason for the ongoing spate of fraudulent and corrupt activities among employees within the DTI Head Office, regardless of the relevant policies put in place. Secondly, another goal is also to establish other reasons that could be linked to the reoccurrence of fraudulent and corrupt activities within the DTI. During the research survey questionnaires were administered to employees of the DTI. Furthermore, online interviews were conducted with a purposively selected sample within two divisions of the DTI. In addition, a literature study was conducted to acquire relevant information and perspectives from available national and international literature. Various objectives were fulfilled in this study as follows:  It was established whether the reporting of internal or <b>external</b> <b>fraud</b> and corruption and the relevant policies put in place contribute in any manner to the prevention of fraudulent and corrupt activities at the Department of Trade and Industry's national office.  It was determined if there is a policy document on measuring these policies after they have been implemented.  It was determined how the Department of Trade and Industry's national head office addresses fraud and corruption. Other possible reasons for the Department of Trade and Industry employees' lack of reporting fraud and corruption in their departments, other than the fear of being victimised, were identified.  The views and opinions on the internal reporting of fraud and corruption were determined.  The degree of awareness of the investigative procedures related to fraud and corruption among the Department of Trade and Industry management and their employees were determined.  It was established if employees have faith in the Department of Trade and Industry's investigative procedures to fraud and corruption.  The extent of knowledge on the importance of reporting fraudulent and corrupt activities in the DTI were established.  Feedback to help minimise fraud and corruption within the Department of Trade and Industry and improve future strategies was provided. This study contributes to the knowledge base with regard to fraud and corruption within the Department of Trade and Industry. Criminology and Security ScienceM. Tech (Policing...|$|E
