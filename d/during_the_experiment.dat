5|$|Louis Alexander Slotin (1 December 1910– 30 May 1946) was a Canadian {{physicist}} and chemist {{who worked on}} the Manhattan Project. During World War II, Slotin conducted research at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He performed experiments with uranium and plutonium cores to determine their critical mass values. On 21 May 1946, Slotin was conducting a demonstration when he accidentally initiated a fission reaction, which released a burst of hard radiation. He received a lethal dose of radiation and died of acute radiation syndrome nine days later. Slotin was the second person to die from a criticality accident, following the death of Harry Daghlian, who had been exposed to radiation by the same core that killed Slotin. Slotin was publicly hailed as a hero by the United States government for reacting quickly and preventing his accident from killing any colleagues. He was later criticized for failing to follow protocol <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiment.</b>|$|E

25|$|In a {{study by}} Tellez et al., {{extracts}} from a plant Achyrocline Bogotensis was used to develop an antiviral therapy for both rotavirus and astrovirus. Achyrocline Bogotensis was commonly used for skin and urinary infections. Drug testing methodology involved application of the extract to cell for pre-treatment (blocking), direct viral activity (evidence of killing the virus), and treatment ({{a decrease in the}} viral load after an infection is established). The extract demonstrated direct viral activity by killing astroviruses directly and treatment by leading to a decrease in the viral load after an established infection. A pre-treatment effect was not evidence <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiment.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} test {{would allow}} for low-bandwidth inter-world communication, the limiting factors of bandwidth and time being dependent on the technology of the equipment. Because of {{the time needed to}} determine the state of the partially decohered isolated excited ion based on Itano et al.'s methodology, the ion would decohere by the time its state is determined <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiment,</b> so Plaga's proposal would pass just enough information between the two worlds to confirm their parallel existence and nothing more. The author contemplates that with increased bandwidth, one could even transfer television imagery across the parallel worlds. For example, Itano et al.'s methodology could be improved (by lowering the time needed for state determination of the excited ion) if a more efficient process were found for the detection of fluorescence radiation using 194nm photons.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, {{scientists}} at the Carnegie Institution of Washington examined the pressure limits of life processes. Solutions of bacteria, specifically Escherichia coli and Shewanella oneidensis, {{were placed in the}} DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 GPa, which is more than 16,000 times Earth's surface pressure (985 hPa). After 30 hours, only about 1% of the bacteria survived. The experimenters then added a dye to the solution. If the cells survived the squeezing and were capable of carrying out life processes, specifically breaking down formate, the dye would turn clear. 1.6 GPa is such great pressure that <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> the DAC turned the solution into ice-IV, a room-temperature ice. When the bacteria broke down the formate in the ice, liquid pockets would form because of the chemical reaction. The bacteria were also able to cling {{to the surface of the}} DAC with their tails.|$|E

Returning home, Keith cries and tells Veronica that he made a mistake. The guard puts one prisoner in solitary confinement. Veronica learns that a student, Moe Flater (Andrew McClain), took Parker home the night of the rape. She confronts him, but upon further investigation, she accepts his alibi. Veronica learns that the main surveillance camera of the sorority was in the den mother's room. The prisoners in the experiment successfully escape from prison. Veronica breaks into the room that is under surveillance and finds that they are growing marijuana. Veronica types up her exposé and hands it to the newspaper editor, but before it is published, one of the sorority members informs Veronica that they are growing the cannabis in order to aid the den mother's cancer. Veronica cannot stop the publication of the article, but she warns the sorority about potential repercussions nonetheless. Mac (Tina Majorino) convinces Parker to stay at Hearst.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, zero {{baseline}} {{observations were}} gathered {{in order to}} assess the accuracy of GPS-only, BDS-only and the integration of GPS and BDS relative positioning. There are on average 8 GPS and 8 BDS satellites that could be tracked <b>during</b> <b>the</b> whole BDS orbital period at the University of Nottingham Ningbo, China. Sometimes the number of GPS satellites being tracked above an elevation cut-off angle of 15 ∘ can drop down to only four <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiments.</b> <b>The</b> minimum number of BDS tracked <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiments</b> were six using the same elevation mask of 15 ∘. The results demonstrate that BDS relative positioning accuracy could achieve millimetre level, but is still weaker than that of GPS. The integration of GPS and BDS could improve not only BDS-only, but also GPS-only position precisions.|$|R
