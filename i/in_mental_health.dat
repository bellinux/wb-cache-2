5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the {{psychiatric}} reform that had been implemented by Franco Basaglia in Italy became known and was publicly declared to be implemented in Russia, with the view of retrenchment of expenditures. But {{when it became clear that}} even more money was needed for the reform, it got bogged down in the same way the reform of the army and many other undertakings did. Russia is decades behind the countries of the European Union <b>in</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> reform, which has already been implemented or is being implemented in them. Until Russian society, Gushansky says, is aware of the need for mental health reform, we will live in the atmosphere of animosity, mistrust and violence. Many experts believe that problems spread beyond psychiatry to society as a whole. As Robert van Voren supposes, the Russians want to have their compatriots with mental disorders locked up outside the city and do not want to have them in community. Despite the 1992 Russian Mental Health Law, coercive psychiatry in Russia remains generally unregulated and fashioned by the same trends toward hyperdiagnosis and overreliance on institutional care characteristic of the Soviet period. In the Soviet Union, there had been an increase of the bed numbers because psychiatric services had been used to treat dissidents.|$|E

25|$|Psychiatric nursing {{or mental}} health nursing is the {{appointed}} {{position of a}} nursing that has specialized <b>in</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> and cares for {{people of all ages}} with mental illness or mental distress, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis, depression, dementia and many more. Nurses in this area receive specific training in psychological therapies, building a therapeutic alliance, dealing with challenging behavior, and the administration of psychiatric medication. In most countries, a psychiatric nurse will have to have attained a bachelor's degree in nursing to become a registered nurse (RN) and specialise <b>in</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health.</b> Degrees vary in different countries, and are governed by country-specific regulations. Psychiatric nurses work in hospitals, mental institutes, correctional institutes, and many other facilities.|$|E

25|$|Prisons in wealthy, {{industrialized nations}} provide {{medical care for}} most of their inmates. Additionally, prison medical staff {{play a major role in}} monitoring, organizing, and {{controlling}} the prison population through the use of psychiatric evaluations and interventions (psychiatric drugs, isolation <b>in</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> units, etc.). Prison populations are largely from poor minority communities that experience greater rates of chronic illness, substance abuse, and mental illness than the general population. This leads to a high demand for medical services, and in countries such as the US that don't provide free healthcare, prison is often the first place that people are able to receive medical treatment (which they couldn't afford outside).|$|E
25|$|While Ellis' {{personal}} atheism and humanism remained consistent, {{his views}} {{about the role of}} religion <b>in</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> changed over time. In early comments delivered at conventions and at his institute in New York City, Ellis overtly and often with characteristically acerbic delivery stated that devout religious beliefs and practices were harmful to mental health. In The Case Against Religiosity, a 1980 pamphlet published by his New York institute, he offered an idiosyncratic definition of religiosity as any devout, dogmatic and demanding belief. He noted that religious codes and religious individuals often manifest religiosity, but added that devout, demanding religiosity is also obvious among many orthodox psychotherapists and psychoanalysts, devout political believers and aggressive atheists.|$|E

An Australian psychiatric nurse has duties that may include assessing patients who are mentally ill, observation, helping patients take part in activities, giving medication, observing if the medication is working, assisting in behaviour change programs or visiting patients who are at home. Australian nurses can work in public or private hospitals, institutes, correctional institutes, mental care facilities and homes of the patients.|$|E
