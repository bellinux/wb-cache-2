5000|$|Samahope [...] is a {{crowdfunding}} {{platform that}} directly <b>funds</b> <b>doctors</b> who provide life-changing medical treatments {{for women and}} children in poor communities. Samahope lets donors <b>fund</b> <b>doctors</b> around the globe so they can treat more patients suffering from treatable medical conditions like birth injuries, birth defects, burns, blindness, and trauma-based injuries. Leila Janah introduced Samahope in 2013 and it gained widespread recognition for the Honor Your Mom campaign. [...] Samahope enables a new community of donors and change makers to come together to fund these life-saving treatments for a few dollars at a time. In December 2015, Samahope was acquired by Johnson & Johnsons, and became a part of CaringCrowd.|$|R

50|$|After retiring, Clynes {{was living}} in very straitened circumstances, with no other income than trade union pension of £6 per week.

50|$|One MD {{was charged}} in {{criminal}} court for sexually assaulting multiple patients, was convicted, then was sued by those victims in civil court.

The CMPA, however, will not pay civil damages to a patient assaulted by a doctor even if the assault occurred during a medical exam.

50|$|Janah founded Samahope in 2012, {{the first}} {{crowdfunding}} platform that directly <b>funded</b> <b>doctors</b> who provide life-changing medical treatments {{for women and}} children in poor communities. Samahope enabled anyone anywhere to directly fund doctors' life-changing medical treatments for {{women and children in}} need. Samahope was built on the belief that transparent funding mechanisms could help close the global surgery gap and ensure that all people have access to medical treatments Samahope combined with Johnson & Johnson's new global health platform, CaringCrowd, at the close of December 2015. Janah spoke about the decision to merge with Caring Crowd in a LinkedIn post, citing efficiency and branding as the two biggest factors.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Create {{a special}} {{adaptation}} of ICD- 10 {{to meet the}} needs of the outpatient sector of the German health care system. Methods: Requirements were identified together with the board of physicians. To ensure consistency with the original classification (even after annual updates) and to allow the automatic production from its master files, the SGML based system was enhanced. The final product was tested in a feasibility study. Results: Very rare conditions were moved to an appendix. A minimum coding level for general practitioners was defined. It is at the four character level only, if their typical equipment allows differential diagnosis or if detail is needed for reimbursement. However, the full four character classification was accepted for medical specialities. Two additional axes for laterality and certainty of diagnosis were introduced. Chapter XX was reduced to 22 codes only. A study with more than 2000 physicians proved feasibility of this approach. Conclusions: The introduction of ICD- 10 -SGBV is planned for 2000 for the outpatient sector. The hospitals will have to use the full classification plus the additional axes for laterality and certainty. Background In the end of 1995 the Federal Ministry for Health tried to introduce ICD- 10 coding for German hospitals and for the outpatient sector of the health care system.

5000|$|The NHS faces {{unprecedented}} financial pressures, {{and there}} are growing worries that patient care will suffer. For social care, it will be increasingly difficult for councils to make further savings without directly cutting services or affecting quality. Health and care services have coped well until now, {{but it is clear}} that many organisations expect things to become much more difficult over the coming year 2013. (John Appleby of the King's <b>Fund)</b> <b>Doctors</b> and nurses across the NHS already complained early in 2011 that front-line NHS services of many different types were having to be cut immediately, and very heavily, in order to achieve these [...] "savings", despite Nicholson alleging that they would not have to be. NHS workers still insist, up to the present day, that it is impossible to find these types of 'savings' in this amount of time without having to make drastic cutbacks to existing services. Even a late-March 2012 news article dealing with the risk register of the Health and Social Care Bill 2011 found fit to mention a few lines about the Nicholson Challenge's £20bn target, mentioning that in the 2010-dated risk register, [...] "Civil servants ... rate highly the danger that the £20bn savings may not materialise as managers lose focus and ... quality of patient care suffers", even though [...] "Ministers in 2012 say that a report to be published on Tuesday shows that the NHS is on course to meet the so called [...] "Nicholson challenge" [...] to save £20bn over the course of this parliament." ...|$|R
