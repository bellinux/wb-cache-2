In Sydney, protesters lay {{down in front of}} the car carrying Johnson and the Premier of New South Wales, Robert Askin (prompting Askin's notorious order to [...] "Run over the bastards"). In Melbourne, a crowd estimated at 750,000 turned out to welcome Johnson, although a vocal anti-war contingent demonstrated against the visit by throwing paint bombs at Johnson's car and chanting [...] "LBJ, LBJ, <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>kids</b> did you kill today?".|$|E

2500|$|As {{casualties}} mounted {{and success}} seemed further away than ever, Johnson's popularity plummeted. College students and others protested, burned draft cards, and chanted, [...] "Hey, hey, LBJ, <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>kids</b> {{did you kill}} today?" [...] Johnson could scarcely travel anywhere without facing protests, and was not allowed by the Secret Service to attend the 1968 Democratic National Convention, where thousands of hippies, yippies, Black Panthers and other opponents of Johnson's policies both in Vietnam and in the ghettos converged to protest. Thus by 1968, the public was polarized, with the [...] "hawks" [...] rejecting Johnson's refusal to continue the war indefinitely, and the [...] "doves" [...] rejecting his current war policies. Support for Johnson's middle position continued to shrink until he finally rejected containment and sought a peace settlement. By late summer, he realized that Nixon was closer to his position than Humphrey. He continued to support Humphrey publicly in the election, and personally despised Nixon. One of Johnson's well known quotes was [...] "the Democratic party at its worst, is still better than the Republican party at its best".|$|E
2500|$|At Elimination Chamber, Nikki Bella and Natalya had a {{backstage}} confrontation {{that lead}} to Natalya shoving Nikki into Maryse. Later that night, The Miz attempted to eliminate John Cena from the WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match only for Miz to get eliminated by Cena. On the February 21 episode of SmackDown, Nikki and Natalya's Falls Count Anywhere match led to the backstage area, where Natalya again shoved Nikki into Maryse, who retaliated by attacking Nikki with a lead pipe, thus costing her the match. In that episode's main event, the same incident between Cena and Miz happened in the WWE Championship number one contender's battle royal, but this time, Miz returned and caused Cena's elimination. Cena was then the guest on Miz TV where Miz criticized Cena for being a hypocrite, as Cena was basically {{doing the same thing}} that he himself had criticized The Rock for doing: leaving the WWE and going to Hollywood. Miz said that he works as hard as Cena, but does not get the same opportunities, and he eliminated Cena to prevent him from going to WrestleMania 33 and wanted Cena to know what he felt when Cena defeated him for the WWE Championship back in 2011. Miz also said that Cena gets what he wants, but Cena said if that were true, he would be facing The Undertaker. Cena then criticized Miz for copying other people's gimmicks and moves, which caused Maryse to slap Cena for insulting her husband. Nikki then came out and Maryse and Miz retreated. The following week, The Miz and Maryse attacked Cena and Nikki after the latter two's match against James Ellsworth and Carmella. The Miz said he was tired of Cena's lies and said his relationship with Nikki was also a lie. Afterwards on Talking Smack, The Miz and Maryse said that Nikki was in her current position because of her relationship with Cena and that Nikki was jealous of them because Cena would not marry Nikki. The following week, Miz and Maryse continued their insults against Cena and Nikki and the two came out and chased Miz and Maryse out of the ring. SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan then came out and said that since he could not fight The Miz, who had been insulting him for several months, both The Miz and Maryse would face Cena and Nikki at WrestleMania; Maryse's last match was in 2011. The Miz and Maryse then made fun of Cena and Nikki's reality show Total Bellas by impersonating them in [...] "unaired footage". On March 27, Cena was a guest host on NBC's Today and revealed weatherman Al Roker as the guest ring announcer for the match. On the final SmackDown before WrestleMania, more [...] "unaired footage" [...] from Total Bellas was shown. The Miz and Maryse then threw more insults at Cena and Nikki, including Cena not wanting to have kids. Cena retaliated and asked <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>kids</b> Miz and Maryse had. Cena said that although he takes time off to make movies, he comes back to WWE when he is done, just as The Miz and other WWE Superstars have done before. Cena called Maryse a waste of a paycheck as she does not do much on the show and that she was only back in the WWE because Miz begged for it. Cena then said that he and Nikki would destroy Miz and Maryse at WrestleMania.|$|E

After the police arrival, those who were picketing moved into nearby Grant Park to avoid a mass arrest situation. Once the marchers had reached Grant Park, there was a brief rally where Davis and Hayden claimed the day a success, and then went to Lincoln Park where the Festival of Life music festival was beginning.|$|E
5000|$|A Gallup poll in July 1967 showed 52 {{percent of}} the country disapproving of Johnson's {{handling}} of the war and only 34 percent thought progress was being made.

5000|$|Another way to lie, {{other than}} {{outright}} lying, is confabulation. Confabulation {{is not an}} outright lie: it happened to the patient at some point, they just cannot recall when.

So a patient might have eaten an exquisite meal twenty years ago on their honeymoon and claimed they ate it yesterday simply because they cannot remember. Confabulation is also a defense mechanism, {{to protect themselves from}} embarrassment. When asked <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>kids</b> they have, they will often lie because [...] "what kind of monster forgets their children" [...] sic? It is, in short, honest lying.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the time}} he wrote The Spitting Image, Lembcke had not found a single {{substantiated}} media report to support the now common claims of spitting. He theorizes that the reported [...] "spitting on soldiers" [...] scenario was a mythical projection by those who felt [...] "spat upon" [...] by an American society tired of the war; an image which was then used to discredit future antiwar activism and serve political interests. He suggests that the manufactured images of pro-war antipathy against antiwar protesters also helped contribute to the myth. Lembcke asserts that memories of being verbally and physically assaulted by antiwar protesters were largely conjured, noting that not even one case could be reliably documented. He further suggests the [...] "baby-killer" [...] and [...] "murderer" [...] components of the myth may have been reinforced, in part, by the common chants by protesters aimed at President Lyndon Baines Johnson, like [...] "Hey, hey, LBJ, <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>kids</b> did you kill today?" ...|$|E
