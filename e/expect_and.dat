Soon, the Albanian right wing advanced to engage first and managed to push the Venetian left wing back, while {{the center and the}} right engaged the Venetian center and left. The breakthrough was soon accomplished by attacking the gaps in the Venetian lines, causing disorder among their ranks. The battle continued for hours until large groups of Venetian troops began to flee. Skanderbeg, seeing his fleeing adversaries, ordered a full-scale offensive, routing the entire Venetian army. The Republic's soldiers were chased right to the gates of Scutari, and Venetian prisoners were thereafter paraded outside the fortress.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} empirically {{whether the}} <b>expected</b> <b>and</b> unexpected components of monetary policy have nonlinear {{impacts on the}} dynamics of REIT returns. Empirical results find the nonlinear response of REIT returns to <b>expected</b> <b>and</b> unexpected components of monetary policy. The unexpected component of monetary policy plays a more prominent role in influencing REIT returns than does the expected component of monetary policy. Specifically, unexpected contractionary monetary policy has a significantly adverse impact on REIT returns, and the adverse effect in a bust market is stronger than in a boom market. In addition, the unexpected monetary policy will also affect the boom-bust dynamics of REIT returns through {{its effect on the}} time-varying transition probability matrix. The tightening of the <b>expected</b> <b>and</b> unexpected components of monetary policy will enhance the probability that the REIT market will stay in the bust regime. <b>Expected</b> <b>and</b> unexpected monetary policies Nonlinear effect REIT returns Markov switching...|$|R

25|$|Despite {{their lack}} of graphics, text adventures include a {{physical}} dimension where players move between rooms. Many text adventure games boasted their total number of rooms to indicate how much gameplay they offered. These games are unique in that they may create an illogical space, where going north from area A takes you to area B, but going south from area B did not {{take you back to}} area A. This can create mazes that do not behave as players <b>expect,</b> <b>and</b> thus players must maintain their own map. These illogical spaces are much more rare in today's era of 3D gaming, and the Interactive Fiction community in general decries the use of mazes entirely, claiming that mazes have become arbitrary 'puzzles for the sake of puzzles' and that they can, in the hands of inexperienced designers, become immensely frustrating for players to navigate.|$|E
25|$|After honing their live set at Slattery's, {{they played}} two concerts, {{afternoon}} and evening, at Newbridge College on Thursday, 16 March 1972. Donovan {{was in the}} audience and invited Planxty to open for him on his six-date Irish tour the following week, during which their first major performanceat the Hangar in Galwaywas a huge success. Neither the audience nor the band knew what to <b>expect,</b> <b>and</b> both were pleasantly surprised. Irvine, unable to see the audience through {{the glare of the}} stage lights, was worried that the crowd might {{be on the verge of}} rioting. It took him several minutes to realize that what he was hearing was the expression of their enthusiastic response to the band's music. On 21 April 1972, Planxty embarked on their first tour of England, which had been booked previously by Moore, and played small folk clubs in Manchester, Bolton, Leeds, Hull, Barnsley, Blackpool, Newcastle, Chester and London, to great acclaim, returning to Ireland in May.|$|E
500|$|Time Out London gave a {{positive}} review, enunciating that [...] "Overall, {{the approach is}} less fluffily contrived than you’d <b>expect,</b> <b>and</b> though the alignment of circumstance and social status thwarting innocent passions is hardly fresh, it’s handled with thoughtful decorum. The emotional temperature’s rather restrained as a result, but with luxury casting all down the line,... elegant visuals balancing verdant and velvet, and a delightful faux-classical score, it’s a classy package, all right – just missing the extra spark." [...] Some reviewers have questioned the historical accuracy of the film, for instance critiquing the depicted relationship between Austen and Lefroy.|$|E

500|$|Since 4X games involve {{managing}} a large, detailed empire, game sessions usually {{last longer than}} other strategy games. Game sessions may require several hours of play-time, which can be particularly problematic for multiplayer matches. For example, a small-scale game in Sins of a Solar Empire can last for over 12 hours. However, fans of the genre often <b>expect</b> <b>and</b> embrace these long game sessions; Emrich wrote that [...] "when the various parts are properly designed, other X's seem to follow. Words like EXcite, EXperiment and EXcuses (to one's significant others)". Turn-based 4X games typically divide these sessions into hundreds of turns of gameplay.|$|E

[...] Teammate Frank Lampard was also keen {{to win his}} first trophy: [...] "If you haven't won anything, a runners-up medal is not what you want at all." [...] He also stated that Chelsea manager José Mourinho's desire to win had been rubbing off on the players: [...] "He actually gets angrier with each one, so every time we lose it's the worst I've seen him, he's a winner, though, that's what you <b>expect,</b> <b>and</b> that's the attitude that's needed at Chelsea these days." ...|$|E

A major event for the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry in this battle was a charge at Confederate artillery.

500|$|For Miracle Day, Davies {{commissioned}} new {{costume designer}} Shawna Trpcic (previously costume designer for Angel, Firefly and Dollhouse) {{to create a}} new greatcoat design. This was partially motivated by Los Angeles' warmer climate; shooting in Wales had necessitated Barrowman be fit in much warmer clothing. The new coat is custom made by Italian designers, and is actually cashmere-blend wool where the previous one had been cotton. Trpcic says that she [...] "just wanted to modernise it, give it a more modern fit, but leave the drape and keep it cape-like". Trpcic felt prepared for the job of redesigning the coat because of her prior work on Firefly, tailoring for Nathan Fillion's Captain Malcolm Reynolds: [...] "I'm kind of used to iconic captain's coats and the importance of staying loyal to what the fans <b>expect</b> <b>and</b> to what we need". Journalist Maureen Ryan commented that the new coat is [...] "greatly improved" [...] and the redesign [...] "gives the coat the kind of movement and swagger Jack brings with him on every adventure".|$|E

This baptism gives to the receiver an [...] "enduement of power for life and service, the bestowment of the gifts and their uses {{in the work of}} the ministry". There are four experiences listed in the Fundamental Truths that result from Spirit baptism: [...] "overflowing fullness of the Spirit", [...] "a deepened reverence for God", intensified consecration and dedication to God and his work, and [...] "a more active love for Christ, for His Word and for the lost". In addition, this experience initiates the believer in the use of spiritual gifts. The [...] "initial physical sign" [...] of having received this baptism is [...] "speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance".|$|E

So again entering into the collaborating factor, I didn't know what to <b>expect</b> ... <b>and</b> he's probably thinking the same about me. And when we walked away from working with each other, it was just a love connection. I wanted to maintain and keep consistent with the look of the album packaging and book, and I really wanted to keep all that in line, and so he really paid attention, and I think it's really iconic and classic. We totally made magic together on a creative level, it was absolutely amazing. He really got in and listened to where my music was at".|$|E

[...] A reviewer from About.com said that it is [...] "contemporary retelling of...(an) engaging and timeless tale rich with human emotion and universal drama". The reviewer appreciates the film in most of the nuances of film making saying that this is [...] "enhanced by a brilliant musical score, and accentuated by superb performances by Sanjay Dutt, Saif Ali Khan, Raima Sen, Diya Mirza and debutante Vidya Balan in the lead role of Lalita". 3000 copies of the novella were sold within weeks of the film's release, owing to the film's good reception.|$|E
500|$|According to scholar Sondra O'Neale, Angelou's poetry can {{be placed}} within the African-American oral tradition, and her prose [...] "follows classic {{technique}} in nonpoetic Western forms". [...] O'Neale states that Angelou avoided using a [...] "monolithic black language", and accomplished, through direct dialogue, what O'Neale calls a [...] "more expected ghetto expressiveness". [...] McWhorter finds both the language Angelou used in her autobiographies and the people she depicted unrealistic, resulting in a separation {{between her and her}} audience. [...] As McWhorter states, [...] "I have never read autobiographical writing where I had such a hard time summoning a sense of how the subject talks, or a sense of who the subject really is". [...] McWhorter asserts, for example, that key figures in Angelou's books, like herself, her son Guy, and mother Vivian do not speak as one would <b>expect,</b> <b>and</b> that their speech is [...] "cleaned up" [...] for her readers. [...] Guy, for example, represents the young black male, while Vivian represents the idealized mother figure, and the stiff language they use, as well as the language in Angelou's text, is intended to prove that blacks can use standard English competently.|$|E
