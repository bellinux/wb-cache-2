40|$|Amylase enzyme {{has a great}} {{significance}} for industrial USAges in Indonesia. However, this enzyme is still imported. The use of bacteria in biotechnological process of industrial products such as enzyme production has stimulated the exploration of extracellular amylase producing bacteria. This study aimed to identify and analyze the potential use of amylolytic bacterial enzymes for hydrolyzing cassava starch. Two bacterial isolates, i. e. MII- 10 and DKW- 8 originated from Indonesia soil were identified based on their morphological, physiological and biochemical properties according to the standard protocol. The isolates were then cultivated on fermentation medium and their growth pattern and enzymatic assays were observed. The acetone-precipitated crude enzyme harvested based on predetermined cultivation time was used for enzymatic hydrolysis product characterization on cassava starch using thin layer chromatography (TLC). The {{results showed that the}} mesophilicbacteria isolates (MII- 10 and DKW- 8) were belonged to Bacillus licheniformis. The maximum bacterial cell growth and enzyme activity were reached at 48 hours after incubation. The MII- 10 isolate was found more stable than DKW- 8 in producing amylase enzyme. Amylase produced by the MII- 10 and DKW- 8 isolates was identified to be an endo-a-amylase as confirmed by oligosaccharides and dextrin of the random hydrolysisproducts. Relatively high dextrose equivalence (DE) value of a-amylase of MII- 10 (DE of 9. 96) suggests that the enzyme is prospective for saccharification of starchy material in <b>glucose</b> syrup <b>industry...</b>|$|R

Saccharomyces cerevisiae S 288 C (commonly known as baker's yeast) is the strain mainly usedin the <b>Glucose</b> based fermentation <b>industries.</b> We have seen the use of same yeast strain at different places withdifferent Phenotypic Constraints. The way to improve the adaptability of considered strain for desired phenotypicconditions, using smart selection of genes through cybernetic modeling is illustrated. Phylogenetic homologues forall S. cerevisiae S 288 c Glucose Fermentation pathway genes were screened to search evolutionarily relatedfunctional domains in other yeast strains like Saccharomyces cerevisiae YJM 789, Candida glabrata CBS 138,Kluyveromyces lactis NRRL Y- 1140, Ashbya gossypii ATCC 10895 etc., which are adapted naturally in different setof environment. We observed that Saccharomyces cerevisiae YJM 789, Candida glabrata CBS 138, Ashbyagossypii ATCC 10895, Kluyveromyces lactis NRRL Y- 1140 possess highly conserved functional domains, whichcan be carefully selected based on usage. This study aims at designing an algorithm to select and incorporateevolutionary homologues for genes of a considered strain, which mostly show sub-optimal performance in thedesired set of experimental constraints. Such a consideration of native microenvironment and evolutionarycloseness in the selection of functional homologues of the entire genetic set can thus be significantly fruitful...|$|R
40|$|In {{the bakery}} <b>industry,</b> <b>glucose</b> oxidase is usually used in {{combination}} with xylanase. Although many theories exist on the mechanism of action of each enzyme, {{the positive effect of}} combining the two is as yet unexplained. In this paper we studied a possible basis for this synergy by focusing on the involvement of arabinoxylans. Water-extractable arabinoxylans and water-unextractable solids were studied in dough with or without glucose oxidase. Addition of glucose oxidase led to a stiffer and less extensible dough. Addition of arabinoxylans caused a further decrease in dough extensibility. Addition of xylanase could correct for this decrease. The role of arabinoxylans was further investigated by studying modified water-extractable arabinoxylans and the effect of agents affecting arabinoxylan crosslinking (ferulic acid). Water-extractable arabinoxylan was modified with xylanase to generate a low-molecular-weight fraction (WEAXXYL). Alternatively, it was modified with NaOH to prepare a fraction with a decreased ferulic acid content (WEAXOH). Addition of modified arabinoxylans diminished the effect of glucose oxidase. Glutenin macropolymer and water-extractable arabinoxylan viscosity experiments were performed to obtain further detail on the role of arabinoxylans (AX). These results give rise to a new theory explaining the contribution of xylanase in its synergy with glucose oxidase. In this theory glucose oxidase not only catalyses the formation of protein disulfide bonds, but also of AX-AX crosslinks. The latter negatively affect bread quality. Xylanase corrects for this latter effect by cleaving arabinoxylan complexes and generating small ferulic acid-containing arabinoxylan fragments interfering with the crosslinking of high-molecular weight arabinoxylan...|$|R

Several physical processes are used to produce wines with reduced-alcohol content, all of which involve the selective extraction of ethanol based on volatility or diffusion. In this study, the possibility of Gluzyme MonoÂ® 10. 000 BG (Gluzyme) (Novozymes, South Africa) to reduce the glucose content of synthetic grape juice before fermentation was investigated {{in order to produce}} wine with reduced-alcohol content. Gluzyme is a glucose oxidase preparation from Aspergillus oryzae, currently used in the baking <b>industry.</b> <b>Glucose</b> oxidase catalyses the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide(H 2 O 2) in the presence of molecular oxygen. Gluzyme was initially used in synthetic grape juice, where different enzyme concentrations and factors influencing its efficiency were investigated under winemaking conditions. The results showed up to 0. 5 % v/v less alcohol at an enzyme concentration of 20 kU compared to the control samples. This reduction in alcohol was increased to 1 and 1. 3 % v/v alcohol at pH 3. 5 and pH 5. 5 respectively in aerated (8 mg/L O 2) synthetic grape juice using 30 kU enzyme. Secondly, Gluzyme was used to treat Pinotage grape must before fermentation. Gluzyme-treated wines at 30 kU enzyme concentration after fermentation contained 0. 68 % v/v less alcohol than the control wines. A decrease in acetic acid concentration of the treated compared to control wines was also observed. Publishers' versio...|$|R
40|$|Alcoholic {{fermentation}} (AF) {{conducted by}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{has been exploited}} for millennia in three important human food processes: beer and wine production and bread leavening. Most of the efforts to understand and improve AF have been made separately for each process, with strains that are supposedly well adapted. In this work, we propose a first comparison of yeast AFs in three synthetic media mimicking the dough/wort/grape must found in baking, brewing, and wine making. The fermentative behaviors of nine food-processing strains were evaluated in these media, at the cellular, populational, and biotechnological levels. A large variation in the measured traits was observed, with medium effects usually being greater than the strain effects. The results suggest that human selection targeted the ability to complete fermentation for wine strains and trehalose content for beer strains. Apart from these features, the food origin of the strains did not significantly affect AF, suggesting that an improvement program for a specific food processing industry could exploit the variability of strains used in other <b>industries.</b> <b>Glucose</b> utilization was analyzed, revealing plastic but also genetic variation in fermentation products and indicating that artificial selection {{could be used to}} modify the production of glycerol, acetate, etc. The major result was that the overall maximum CO 2 production rate (Vmax) was not related to the maximum CO 2 production rate per cell. Instead, a highly significant correlation between Vmax and the maximum population size was observed in all three media, indicating that human selection targeted the efficiency of cellular reproduction rather than metabolic efficiency. This result opens the way to new strategies for yeast improvement...|$|R
40|$|Processes in the {{chemical}} industry convert readily available startingmaterials tomore valuable product molecules. Catalytic materials are used in these processes to accelerate chemical transformations so that reactions proceed in a highly efficient manner, achieving high yields of desirable products and avoiding unwanted by-products. Compared to classical stoichiometric procedures, catalysts often allowmore economical and environment-friendly production. Development of heterogeneous catalysts for liquid the phase processes requires detailed knowledge about phenomena that occur on the catalyst surface during the catalytic reaction in liquid phase. Transient response techniques with detectors that can perform continuous, rapid, multi-component and simultaneous detection are ideal for such studies. However, there are hardly any transient techniques available that allow experimental investigation of the adsorption of reactants, intermediates and probe-molecules from liquid phase {{on the surface of}} catalysts. The existing liquid phase detectors are not able to detect more than one specie simultaneously and rapidly, making the more detailed study of the catalytic reaction mechanisms impossible. The work described in this thesis focuses on development and application of a transient response technique for studies of adsorption and catalytic reactions over heterogeneous catalysts in liquid phase with Electro-Spray Ionization (ESI-MS) and Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometry (MIMS) as detectors. Two test reactions, i. e. reduction of nitrite over Pt/SiO 2 and oxidation of glucose over Pt/CNF/Ni catalysts, were used to demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} monitor reactants, intermediates and products during reaction in (semi) quantitative manner. Nitrite hydrogenation is a relevant reaction for both nitrate to nitrogen de-nitrification of drinkingwater, aswell as nitrate hydrogenation to hydroxyl-amine, an intermediate in the production of caprolactam. Oxidative conversion of glucose is important in view of the anticipated shift towards renewable feedstocks for {{the chemical}} <b>industry.</b> <b>Glucose</b> can be upgraded to more valuable compounds e. g. gluconic acid, a building block for production of chelating agents...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MscAgric (Viticulture and Oenology)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Over the years, {{different}} {{techniques have}} been used to legally reduce the ethanol content of wines. Several physical processes are available for producing wines with less alcohol. Despite their efficacy, these treatments have a capital and operational cost influence. They can also affect the concentration of other wine components. On the other hand, vast amount of research has been conducted through genetic modification of wine yeast strains {{in order to reduce the}} ethanol yield of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by diverting sugar metabolism towards various byproducts. However, genetically modified yeasts are not currently accepted in most wine industries worldwide, including South Africa. Therefore, other approaches need to be envisaged. Commercial enzymes are commonly added during winemaking. Most enzymes essential for vinification naturally occur in grapes, but are inefficient under pH and sulphur levels associated with winemaking. Enzymes of fungal origin are resistant to such conditions. The most widely used commercial enzymes include pectinases, hemicellulases, glucanases and glycosidases. With the exception of glucanases, produced by Trichoderma harzianium, all the other enzymes are produced by Aspergillus niger. In this study, the possibility of using Gluzyme MonoÂ® 10. 000 BG (Gluzyme) (Novozymes, South Africa) to reduce the glucose content of synthetic grape must and grape must before fermentation in order to produce wine with a reduced alcohol content was investigated. Gluzyme is a glucose oxidase preparation from Aspergillus oryzae, currently being used in the baking <b>industry.</b> <b>Glucose</b> oxidase catalyses the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of molecular oxygen. Gluzyme was initially used in synthetic grape must where different enzyme concentrations and factors influencing its activity were investigated for its use in winemaking. The results showed that up to 0. 5 % v/v less alcohol were obtained using an enzyme concentration of 20 kU compared to the control. This reduction in alcohol was increased to 1 and 1. 3 % v/v alcohol at pH 3. 5 and pH 5. 5 respectively in aerated synthetic grape must using 30 kU enzyme. Secondly, Gluzyme trials were carried out using Pinotage grape must. Gluzyme treated wines after fermentation contained 0. 68 % v/v less alcohol than the control samples at 30 kU enzyme. Colour and volatile flavour compounds of treated wine did not differ significantly from the untreated samples. Lower free anthocyanin and total phenol concentrations in treated than control samples were observed, possibly due to the hydrogen peroxide oxidation which could have led to polymerisation. The present study has clearly demonstrated that Gluzyme may be used in winemaking to produce reduced-alcohol wine without affecting its colour and aroma compounds. The enzyme in its current form is however, not ideal for winemaking; other forms such as liquid or powder form should be considered if the enzyme is to be used under winemaking conditions. Future work should focus on evaluating the potential new form of the enzyme and studying the effects of Gluzyme in various grape must in semi-industrial scale. A tasting panel should also evaluate its impact on the organoleptic properties and the overall quality of the resulting wines...|$|R
