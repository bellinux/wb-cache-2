The Tylers follow the voice to a remote bay in Norway called Bad Wolf Bay, where a {{holographic}} image of the Doctor appears. He tells Rose he is using the energy of a supernova to transmit to her via one last small breach between universes. Rose breaks down in tears and tells the Doctor that she loves him, and he responds, [...] "Quite right, too, and, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> <b>if</b> {{this is my last}} chance to say it: Rose Tylerâ€”"; before the Doctor can finish his reply, the breach seals and the Doctor's image disappears. In the TARDIS, tears run down the Doctor's cheeks as he slowly regains his composure and sets a course. As he gets back to piloting the TARDIS, he notices a mysterious woman in a wedding dress standing in the TARDIS console room. With the Doctor shocked and confused, the mysterious bride angrily demands to know where she is, leading to the events of [...] "The Runaway Bride".|$|E

2500|$|In mid June Darwin {{returned}} home to Shrewsbury, and continued [...] "working like a tiger" [...] for the Canary scheme, [...] "at present Spanish & Geology, the former I find as intensely stupid, as the latter most interesting". By then his most likely companion on the trip was the tutor Marmaduke Ramsay. Darwin was [...] "trying to make a map" [...] of Shropshire, [...] "but dont find it so easy as I expected." [...] He ordered a clinometer, and on 11 July wrote to tell Henslow that it had arrived and he had tried it out in his bedroom. [...] "As yet I have only indulged in hypotheses; but they are such powerful ones, that <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> <b>if</b> they were put into action but for one day, the world would come to an end." [...] In efforts to learn the basics of geology he extended his mapping of strata {{as far away as}} Llanymynech, some [...] from Shrewsbury, using the terminology he had learnt in Edinburgh from Robert Jameson. Already he was anxious that he had not heard from Sedgwick, and when he investigated ship sailings he found that they were only available in certain months. For this reason, the trip to Teneriffe had to be postponed to the following June, and it looked increasingly unlikely that Henslow would come on the trip. Darwin wrote to one of his student friends that he was [...] "at present mad about Geology" [...] and had plans to ride through Wales then meet with other students at Barmouth.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, I don't," [...] he said; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> that <b>if</b> {{you were}} serious about your anarchism, {{that is exactly}} what you would do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> not. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> can {{get down}} to prayers after having all my things packed up, it will {{be as much as}} I can do." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'My father! Be calm, I beseech you; {{you have}} spoken harsh words; I have not deserted you or my mother; I never will. If I have wronged my cousin, I have {{severely}} suffered, {{and she has}} most freely forgiven me. She is my dear friend.

6000|$|... "You'll find it well to do it, too. Work, and don't drink. You hardly think, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{had married}} your {{daughter}} I should have found myself obliged {{to support you}} in idleness?" ...|$|R

60|$|THE SHERIFF. Morning. You know, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> that <b>if</b> you've stole a {{horse and}} the jury find against you, you wont have any time to settle your affairs. Consequently, if you feel guilty, youd better settle em now.|$|R
