In addition, interest rates rose quickly, making the club unable to meet its financial obligations. At the same time, the club experienced falling attendance. In 1985, the club's auditor warned that the club was heading into <b>financial</b> <b>distress.</b> In 1986, the club spent NOK1 million to build terraces between the club house and the pitch on the northern short side, and terraces on the southern short side.

The route to Molde had given large deficits, and the company was forced to close it down. NOK2.3 million, equal to the airlines debt to the airport, was granted to the municipal-owned airport operator, and the company allowed to make an agreement where half the debt was deleted, {{and the other half}} made interest and principal-free for two years. At the same time, the management of Vildanden had to raise new capital equal to at least half the companies accounts payable, which was NOK8 million. The case raised local debate about whether it was the municipality's job to subsidize the airport and the airline. The Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries announced that they would consider reporting the subsidies to the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) for violation of the European Community competition law.|$|E

Filming started in May 1958 and wrapped in January 1959, and post-production took six months. Although the budget for Ben-Hur was initially $7 million, it was reported to be $10 million by February 1958, reaching $15.175 million by the time shooting began—making it the costliest film ever produced up to that time. When adjusted for inflation, the budget of Ben Hur was approximately $ in constant dollars.|$|E

Before operations could commence, the two creditors of the aircraft, Fokus Bank and Christiania Bank, had to refinance the two holding companies. As the aircraft remained grounded {{when the military}} contract started on 1 April, Norway Airlines had to lease aircraft externally to operate the charters. The aircraft were freed up {{towards the end of}} April, allowing the services with Gullivers Reiser to commence on 28 April.

The Gullivers Reiser contract involved flying from Norway to Greece, Spain, Portugal and Turkey. Air Europe's bankruptcy cost Norway Airlines NOK6 million and required the company to reduce its staff from 196 to 106 employees. One aircraft was fully utilized, although the second was occasionally operated for Star Tour, Vingreiser and British Airways.|$|E

He opposed Riley's interest in poetry and encouraged him to find a different career. The family finances finally disintegrated and they were forced to sell their town home in April 1870 and return to their country farm. Riley's mother was able to keep peace in the family, but after her death in August from heart disease, Riley and his father had a final break. He blamed his mother's death on his father's failure to care for her in her final weeks. He continued to regret the loss of his childhood home and wrote frequently of how it was so cruelly snatched from him by the war, subsequent poverty, and his mother's death. After the events of 1870, he developed an addiction to alcohol which he struggled with for the remainder of his life.|$|E

More recently when Mark van Bommel's home club Fortuna Sittard was in <b>financial</b> <b>distress</b> Bayern came to a charity game at the Dutch club. Another well known example was the transfer of Alexander Zickler in 1993 from Dynamo Dresden. When Bayern picked up Zickler for 2.3 Million DM many considered the sum to be a subvention for the financially threatened Dresdeners. In 2003, Bayern provided a 2 Million Euro loan without collateral to the nearly bankrupt Borussia Dortmund which has since been repaid. On 14 July 2013, Bayern played a charity game against financially threatened third division Hansa Rostock. The game raised about €1 million, securing Hansa's licence.|$|E

25|$|Corporate {{bankruptcy}} {{can arise}} {{as a result}} of two broad categories failure—business failure or <b>financial</b> <b>distress.</b> Business failure stems from a critical flaw in the company's business model that prohibits it from producing the necessary level of profit to justify its capital investment. Conversely, <b>financial</b> <b>distress</b> stems from a critical flaw in the way the company is financed, or its capital structure. Continued <b>financial</b> <b>distress</b> leads to either technical insolvency (assets outweigh liabilities, but the firm is unable to meet current obligations) or “bankruptcy” (liabilities outweigh assets, and the firm has a negative net worth). A company experiencing business failure can stay off bankruptcy as long as it has access to funding; conversely, a company that experiencing financial failure will be pushed into bankruptcy regardless of the soundness of its business model. The actual causes of corporate bankruptcies are difficult to establish, due to the compounding effects of external (macroeconomic, industry) and internal (business or financial) factors. However, some studies have indicated that financial leverage and working capital mismanagement are likely two of the major causes of corporate failure and bankruptcy in the U.S.|$|E

40|$|Selling {{on credit}} is rather {{frequent}} in Mediterranean countries.

In spite of the relevance of this problem there are few empirical researches. This work intends to fill this gap and {{to shed light on}} the factors related to the extension of trade credit. In the theoretical and empirical literature, different motives have been proposed to explain this issue: a mechanism to reduce transaction costs, a financial alternative to the bank system and an additional tool to improve commercial activities. To contrast these ideas a panel of 388 firms of the Spanish agrofood industry has been taken, and static and dynamic regression models have been estimated by using robust methods to heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation and endogeneity of the explanatory variables. The results confirm that trade credit receivable is associated with more active firms and with cheaper bank financing. Other factors with positive relationships are short-term bank debts and accounts payable.

The farm crisis of the 1980 s was {{considered by many to be}} the most severe financial crisis for American agricultural producers since the Great Depression. Unmanageable debt loads are blamed for producing severe financial stress which, in turn, led to psychological distress among farm families. However, research suggests that some mediating factors may alleviate the effects of <b>financial</b> stress on <b>distress.</b> Previous research on the farm crisis has concentrated on the mediating effects of perceptual factors. Utilizing data from surveys of Texas farmers in 1986 and 1988, this analysis investigates the factors affecting the levels of <b>financial</b> stress and <b>distress</b> among Texas farm families, and the effects of economic mediators on the relationship between <b>financial</b> stress and <b>distress.</b> The theoretical model is founded upon the stress process model developed by Pearlin et al. (1981), and the model of economic vulnerability and depression developed by Belyea and Lobao (1990). Results from the present analysis using logistic regression analyses suggest that the number of years in farming, proportion of the household income from off-farm employment, proportion of farm ownership, proportion of the farm operation in crop production, and farm size are related to level of financial stress, and that levels of economic adjustments made in debt payments and expenditures, levels of financial stress, and proportion of the farm operation in crops are related to distress. Economic adjustments were found not to alleviate the effects of <b>financial</b> stress on <b>distress.</b> Findings suggest that theoretical models guiding future research on distress include social support, perceptual, and economic adjustment mediators...|$|R
