500|$|Nathin Rabin of The A.V. Club, {{who gave}} the episode a B+ grade, said it was [...] "long on pathos and awkwardness but short on laughs", but {{described}} it as [...] "a very satisfying way to end a very satisfying season". Although Rabin said the final scene with Jim and Pam was filmed and handled artfully, he also {{expressed concern that the}} subplot could turn into a cliched device, and said [...] "part of me felt it was a rather pat, heavy-handed way of ending the season on a dramatic note." [...] Will Leitch of New York magazine expressed concern about the dangers of television shows adding a pregnancy subplot, but said of the episode, [...] "For now, we’ll bask in the happiness of two main characters who have waited a long time for it." [...] Leitch, who called Holly the show's [...] "most beloved guest star", also complimented the way the episode handled Michael and Holly's brief reunion: [...] "The couple and the producers seem to have come to the same conclusion about this relationship: Holly (Amy Ryan) can’t actually stay with Michael (Steve Carell), so let’s <b>just</b> <b>enjoy</b> her while she’s here." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN complimented the episode but said it [...] "doesn't really reach that high", which he said was disappointing following a string of eventful episodes. He praised the Holly character and the way Jim and Dwight worked so well together during the volleyball game, and although he said the final scene was a nice moment between Jim and Pam, he also said the twist was [...] "predictable and telegraphed".|$|E
500|$|In contrast, British {{magazine}} CVG cited {{her appearance}} in Soulcalibur IV as appealing, stating [...] "Ivy...we like because she barely wears anything. Yes, we like videogame girls." [...] IGN in their [...] "Babes of Soulcalibur" [...] article noted that while her outfit pushed the line even by game standards, {{they had no}} actual complaint towards that aspect of the character. Team Xbox emphasized that while her appearance played a factor in her allure, her fighting skills and unique weapon were significant as well, adding that [...] "Ivy never disappoints in a swordfight". Leigh Alexander in an article for GameSetWatch noted that while characters such as Samus Aran served as [...] "bastions of dignity", characters such as Ivy filled {{an important role in}} video games too, stating [...] "t looks like Ivy’s back is set to snap – but she’s a game character; she’ll be fine. Why not <b>just</b> <b>enjoy</b> it?" [...] The Escapist noted that the character's behavior and sex appeal defined the character rather than serving as an extraneous aspect, stating [...] "Ivy's oversexed dominatrix demeanor perfectly compliments her confident, punishing move set." [...] UGO.com repeated the sentiment, noting in their [...] "Top 11 Girls of Gaming" [...] article [...] "Soul Calibur's mega-bombastic whip-wielding hottie isn't the only babe in the game, or even the best-endowed...but her combination of sultry moves and revealing outfits shoots her up the charts." [...] In an examination of feminist viewpoints regarding women in gaming, comedian and writer Liana Kerzner cited Ivy as an example of misperception of an empowered female character, noting that when compared to characters such as Wonder Woman the latter was considered a positive character for being [...] "empowered" [...] despite sharing similar exposing outfits and physical builds. She further went on to state that the character was interesting for having [...] "to fight her own flawed battle with no help from anyone", and that women passionate about gaming had more in common with the character: [...] "aggressive, intimidating, combative, and scrabbling through life by sheer will, armed with homemade weapons".|$|E

2500|$|Cantrell was a {{close friend}} of former Alice in Chains' lead singer Layne Staley, who he {{described}} as his best friend. Staley died in April 2002 at the same time of Cantrell's Degradation Trip tour, but Cantrell opted not to cancel any shows, stating, [...] "It's difficult to do interviews - it's hard to talk about it [...] I'm just thankful to have a tour and work - something I can focus on.". [...] "The shows I played between the time I got the word about Layne and Layne's funeral were very important to me in terms of being able to continue on. It's {{one of those things where}} if you take a break and allow things to settle in, it might be harder to get up again." [...] Cantrell's manager at the time, Bill Siddons, said: [...] "Jerry really loved Layne. They had a bond I haven't seen before." [...] Asked about Staley's death in an interview with MTV in July 2002, Cantrell said: [...] "It's something I'm still dealing with, and I still think like he's here. I miss him tremendously. I love him and have to move on. I'll remember him and respect the memories of what we did together and <b>just</b> <b>enjoy</b> life... and that's all I'll say about it." [...] William DuVall, who performed Staley's vocals during Cantrell's solo concerts, elaborated on this emotional period saying: [...] "I lost my grandfather in the same week, so Cantrell and I both hit the road with immense personal losses dogging us. There were times on stage—there was one show in Charlotte where it was just so heavy. I'm holding back tears onstage, and Jerry would start crying onstage too a lot at that point, and a lot of times we would just look at each other when we were singing the stuff because it was the only way... it was heavy. I can't quantify it really in words." [...] Cantrell canceled the show that he was scheduled to perform at Zephyrhills's Livestock Festival on April 28 in order to attend Staley's funeral in Seattle in the same day. Cantrell dedicated his solo album, Degradation Trip, released two months after Staley's death, to his memory. He also adopted Staley's cat, a female siamese named Sadie, after his death. The cat appeared on Cantrell's episode of MTV Cribs, which was shot at his ranch in Oklahoma in September 2002. Sadie died on the same night of Alice in Chains' concert in Seattle on October 8, 2010, aged 18.|$|E
