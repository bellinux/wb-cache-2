Current {{international}} {{standards for the}} statistical treatment of the issue In many cases, a business will set up a separate legal entity in order to undertake operations in an economy outside its home economy. However, where a separate entity is not created in the outside economy, but the operations are substantial, a notional <b>institutional</b> <b>unit</b> resident in that economy may be identified for statistical purposes. In this paper, such a unit is called a “branch. ” 1 Although a branch is not a legal entity, it behaves in many ways as if it were, and treating it as a unit can allow statistics to give a better portrayal of the economic reality, see 1993 SNA paras. 4. 49 - 52. (An issues paper for DITEG deals with the valuation of branches, so this paper is only concerned with the units and residence issues.)

40|$|Various {{studies have}} pointed out that a {{successful}} integration of public transport and land use requires plans covering the entire metropolitan region that are consistent {{over a long period of}} time. The proposition that is explored in this article is that railway corridors can offer an effective spatial and institutional focus for this. For this purpose, a real-world case in Tokyo, where a corridor-based approach is central to the coordination of public transport and land-use developments, was examined. The analysis combines and links spatial and institutional dimensions. Three criteria are employed in the spatial analysis: corridor transport characteristics, land-use densities, and land-use mix. On the institutional side, the role the local government and the private railway sector play in developing railway corridors in Tokyo is discussed. The exploration seems to support the proposition that the railway corridor can be a convenient spatial and <b>institutional</b> <b>unit</b> in which to integrate transport and land-use developments.

30|$|This {{article has}} drawn on FS and STS {{literature}} {{in order to}} explore how a new <b>institutional</b> <b>unit</b> for technological foresight and advice to the EC has (1) formulated particular ideas about public concerns and how to address them, and (2) produced a vision for a CCS-future with implications {{not only for the}} technology itself, but also for the organization {{of a wide range of}} social and political structures around it. In contrast with understandings of technology as defined by its technical functions—“The only reason to build a CCS plant is to avoid atmospheric emissions of CO 2 [45]”—the construction of ZEP’s recommendations implicates a diverse network of European actors, whose stakes in the technology are defined in relation to sociotechnical arrangements, rather than against isolated technical properties. This case thus illustrates how units of foresight can be seen as producing sociotechnical imaginaries with important co-productionist implications, which in ZEP’s case consisted of authoritative and “policy-ready” expert advice produced alongside formulations of pan-European economic and political interests, and constructions of knowledge-deficient publics ready to be persuaded by experts. While the role of ENGOs have helped illustrate this in the case of CCS and ZEP, it is not unlikely that similar dynamics are at play in other ETPs dealing with technologies which, even if less overtly controversial, nevertheless implicate choices about governance mechanisms and societal arrangements. Processes of issue framing and stakeholder representation in ETPs therefore deserve further study.|$|E

Such contemporary education research builds on advances in the study of child development and relies on rigorous empirical inquiry to guide educational practice and policy. As the field moves forward, the College of Education at Penn State has an opportunity to provide leadership in crafting a new science of education that blends basic and applied research in learning, teaching, and development throughout the lifecourse.

In most cases, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that an <b>institutional</b> <b>unit</b> has a center of economic interest in a country if the unit has already engaged in economic activities and transactions on a significant scale in the country for one year or more, or if the unit intends to do so.

The one-year period is suggested only as a guideline and not as an inflexible rule. 66. A household has a center of economic interest when household members maintain, within the country, a dwelling or succession of dwellings treated and used by members of the household as their principal residence. All individuals who belong to the same household must be residents of the same country. If a member of an existing household ceases to reside in the country where his or her household is resident, the individual ceases to be a member of that household. 67.

The purpose of the study is to gain insight whether fund size and boutique or institutional fund structure of unit trusts affects returns. It expands the body of knowledge on investment performance factors and equips investors with a tool to make informed decisions when contemplating various fund manager offerings. Data was collected from the database of the Association for Savings and Investment (ASISA) for South African general equity unit trust returns and fund size information covering a period of 44 quarters from March 2001 to December 2011. Domestic general equity unit trusts were analysed during the period under review. A regression analysis was run to test for fund size as an indicator of investment performance. A parallel study was conducted to test whether boutique funds outperform institutional funds. The results indicate that fund size has no influence on fund performance. The findings also show that there is {{no significant difference between the}} performance of boutique style unit trust funds and <b>institutional</b> <b>unit</b> trust funds. These findings contradict the findings of previous research by (Fama, 1972); (Chen, Hong, Huang, &Kubik, 2004; Ciccotello&Grant, 1996; Droms&Walker, 1996) who found fund size, either positively or negatively have an influence on mutual fund returns while (Gallagher&Martin, 2005) and Schönfeld (2009) concluded that boutique funds offer better returns compared to institutional funds.
