5000|$|This {{bibliography}} of Abraham Lincoln {{is a comprehensive}} list of written and published works about or by Abraham Lincoln, 16th President of the United States. In terms of primary sources containing Lincoln's letters and writings, scholars rely on The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, edited by Roy Basler, and others. [...] It only includes writings by Lincoln, and omits <b>incoming</b> <b>correspondence.</b> In the six decades since Basler completed his work, some new documents written by Lincoln have been discovered. Currently, a project is underway at the Papers of Abraham Lincoln to provide [...] "a freely accessible comprehensive electronic edition of documents written by and to Abraham Lincoln". [...] The Papers of Abraham Lincoln completed Series I of their project The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln in 2000. They electronically launched The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln, Second Edition in 2009, and published a selective print edition of this series.

[...] These volumes have become a standard resource for Lincoln and Civil War scholarship, however they suffer from numerous limitations and omissions. First, Collected Works did not include <b>incoming</b> <b>correspondence</b> which denies the reader important contexts for understanding the documents. Second, twenty-first century technology and the maturation of documentary editing as a profession can now allow for more faithful renditions of the texts. Thirdly, in the nearly sixty years {{since the publication of}} Collected Works, researchers have discovered many new Lincoln documents, and new historical scholarship can better inform our understandings of the texts. [...] With these reasons likely in mind, Lincoln biographer David Herbert Donald assessed, [...] "Though Roy Basler and his associates did an excellent job of editing Lincoln's writings a generation ago, I believe that it is time for a new, complete, updated edition of his works." ...|$|E

Finally, one more group of scholars refrains from conclusions and limit themselves to referring letters, declarations and statements.As late as 1966 Don Javier went on courting Franco, but the years of 1967-1969 re-defined his relation with Carlism and with Spain. In 1967 he had accepted resignation of Valiente, the last Traditionalist bulwark in the executive, and entrusted political leadership of the Comunión to a set of collegial bodies, all dominated by Hugocarlistas; the move marked their final victory in struggle to control the organization. In 1968 Carlos Hugo was expulsed from Spain; in a demonstrative gesture, few days later Don Javier flew to Madrid, shortly to be expulsed - for the 5th time - as well. This episode marked the end of an increasingly sour dialogue with the regime and the Carlist shift to unconditional opposition; Don Javier would never return to Spain again. In 1969 the Alfonsist prince Juan Carlos was officially introduced as the future king and successor to Franco; the ceremony marked the ultimate crash of Bourbon-Parmas’ hopes for the crown.|$|E
