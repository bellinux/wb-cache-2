She is the Kuladevi (family goddess) of many Hindus {{from western}} and {{southern}} India, including Goud Saraswat Brahmins, Karhade Brahmins, Daivajnas and Bhandaris. The chief temple of Mahalasa Narayani is at Mardol, Goa, though <b>her</b> <b>temples</b> also {{exist in the}} states of Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. Mahalasa has four hands, carrying a Trishula, a sword, a severed head, and a drinking bowl. She stands on a prostrate man or demon, as a tiger or lion licks blood dripping from the severed head. Goud Saraswat Brahmins as well as Vaishnavas from Goa and South Canara identify her with Mohini and call her Narayani and Rahu-matthani, the slayer of Rahu, as told in the Bhavishya Purana.|$|E

25|$|Eight {{years after}} the storm had {{scattered}} them, the fleet {{of more than a}} thousand ships was gathered again. But when they had all reached Aulis, the winds ceased. The prophet Calchas stated that the goddess Artemis was punishing Agamemnon for killing either a sacred deer or a deer in a sacred grove, and boasting that he was a better hunter than she. The only way to appease Artemis, he said, was to sacrifice Iphigenia, who was either the daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, or of Helen and Theseus entrusted to Clytemnestra when Helen married Menelaus. Agamemnon refused, and the other commanders threatened to make Palamedes commander of the expedition. According to some versions, Agamemnon relented, but others claim that he sacrificed a deer in her place, or that at the last moment, Artemis took pity on the girl, and took her to be a maiden in one of <b>her</b> <b>temples,</b> substituting a lamb. Hesiod says that Iphigenia became the goddess Hecate.|$|E

50|$|Hatshepsut {{realized}} {{that she needed to}} legitimize her reign, regardless of her bloodline and only daughter of Thutmose I. Instead, she followed traditional legitimization practices to reign by claiming her birth to be the will of a god like other kings had claimed since the fifth dynasty. She solidified these claims by having them inscribed in <b>her</b> mortuary <b>temple</b> walls at Deir el Bahari, which also include her Divine Birth, Coronation sequence as well as the Expedition to Punt. These inscriptions were strictly for high officials and priests. Other parts of <b>her</b> <b>temple</b> were accessible to the public during festivals. This would also solidify her authority as well as the worship of her god and father, Amun (for which the temple is dedicated to), through offerings and visitation. Her Divine Birth can be found in <b>her</b> <b>temple</b> at the Middle Colonnade of the Northern Wall. Her Coronation can be found in <b>her</b> <b>temple</b> at the Middle Colonnade of the Northern Wall (Upper Register).|$|R

Over the years, Monet {{became more and more}} obsessed with color and light. When his wife was dying in September 1879, Monet painted her in Camille Monet on Her Deathbed (1879), noting the [...] "blue, yellow, grey tones". Monet told his friend, French statesman Georges Clemenceau (18411929), that he spent the time [...] "focusing on <b>her</b> <b>temples</b> and automatically analyzing the succession of appropriately graded colors which death was imposing on her motionless face."

Entry to <b>her</b> <b>temple</b> was permitted only to her priestesses, the Vestals, who tended the sacred fire at the hearth in <b>her</b> <b>temple.</b> As she was considered a guardian of the Roman people, her festival, the Vestalia (7-15 June), was {{regarded as one of}} the most important Roman holidays. During the Vestalia matrons of the city walked barefoot to the sanctuary of the goddess, and gave offerings. Such was Vesta's importance to Roman religion that hers was one of the last republican pagan cults still active following the rise of Christianity until it was forcibly disbanded by the Christian emperor Theodosius I in AD 391.|$|R
