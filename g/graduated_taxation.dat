It began in Usangi, one of the chiefdoms, when the district commissioner arrived for discussions with the local chief. A crowd of five hundred women appeared, demanding an explanation of mbiru, a system of <b>graduated</b> <b>taxation.</b> When the commissioner tried to leave without addressing the women, they became enraged and mobbed the assembled officials. Two days later, women surrounded the chief's house singing songs, and ultimately stoned officials and battled police.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Although Yan {{constantly}} {{spoke of}} the desirability and need for reforms, until the 1930s he remained too conservative to implement anything resembling the kind of reforms needed to successfully modernize Shanxi. Many of his attempts at reform in the 1920s had been attempted generations before, during the Tongzhi Restoration. These Qing Dynasty reformers had found their reforms inadequate {{solutions to the problems}} of their time, and under the Model Governor these reforms proved equally unsatisfactory. During the 1930s Yan became increasingly open to radical social and economic policies, including wealth redistribution via <b>graduated</b> <b>taxation,</b> state-led industrialization, opposition to the money economy, an orientation towards functional (vs. [...] "moral") education and the large-scale assimilation of Western technology. Despite his adoption of Soviet-style economic policies and increasingly radical attempts at social reform, Yan was regarded as a [...] "conservative" [...] throughout his career, suggesting that the term [...] "conservative" [...] must be used carefully within the context of modern Chinese history.|$|E
5000|$|Compound {{empowerment}} {{has been}} evoked to justify progressive taxation and other policies which stress the fundamental fairness of taxing wealthy individuals and corporations {{in a manner}} commensurate with their earnings. Because private capital is compounded by infrastructural resources held in common, supporters of progressive taxation argue that rich individuals and businesses should {{be called upon to}} support the infrastructures that enable the acquisition and maintenance of their wealth. Since a poor individual uses compound empowerment to a far lesser degree than wealthy individuals, it follows that the former would pay a smaller portion of taxes than the latter. Advocates of tax cuts or other policies that mitigate the taxation of the wealthy tend to argue that progressive taxation [...] "punishes" [...] the rich for their superior performance in the market. The concept of compound empowerment, on the other hand, argues that, having generated their wealth in part through public structures, fairness demands an equitable return to those structures through <b>graduated</b> <b>taxation.</b>|$|E

40|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, the US system of public finance {{underwent}} a dramatic transformation. The late nineteenth-century regime of indirect, hidden, partisan, and regressive taxes was eclipsed in the early twentieth century by a direct, transparent, professionally administered, and progressive tax system. In Making the American Fiscal State, Ajay K. Mehrotra uncovers the contested roots and paradoxical consequences of this fundamental shift in American tax law and policy. He argues that the move toward a regime of direct and <b>graduated</b> <b>taxation</b> marked the emergence of a new fiscal polity - a new form of statecraft that was guided not simply by the functional need for greater revenue but by broader social concerns about economic justice, civic identity, bureaucratic capacity, and public power. Between the end of Reconstruction and the onset of the Great Depression, the intellectual, legal, and administrative foundations of the modern fiscal state first took shape. This book explains how and why this new fiscal polity came to be. First comprehensive history of the fundamental transformation in American public finance that has given us our current US tax system. Explores national, state and local efforts at fundamental tax reform at {{the turn of}} the twentieth century. Uses tax law and policy as a vehicle to understand the historical significance of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Like most {{developing}} countries, Uganda faces serious fiscal {{challenges in}} her effort to mobilize and effectively use resources for poverty reduction. however, {{the tax base}} remains small {{as reflected in the}} low tax-to-GDP. the government is under internal and external pressure to increase its domestic revenue collection and i turn, reduce its dependency on donors. In response to the pressure the government endeavored to maintain fiscal discipline, partly by raising taxes. the consequences of this move on the poor remains unclear. the main {{purpose of this paper is}} to throw light on the effects of alternative reforms to existing tax system on those households living in poverty. The analysis was carried out using the nationally representative Uganda national household survey of 1999 / 00 (UNHS I) using micro-simulation techniques. the key findings emerging from the analysis are: Increasing value added tax (VAT) other taxes unchanged will increase the tax burden of the poor but the non-poor households will continue paying more taxes relative to their expenditures that the poor households; Zero rating of the key taxable consumer items consumed by the poor would have little fiscal consequences. the amount of revenue forgone is less than the graduated tax (head tax) forgone; and the largest portion of the tax burden born by the poor households originates from VAT followed by excise duties and <b>graduated</b> tax. <b>Taxation,</b> Ssewanyana, Okidi, economic policy research center, Domestic revenue, Taxing systems, Poverty reduction, Consumer/Household Economics, Demand and Price Analysis, Financial Economics, Industrial Organization, Labor and Human Capital,...|$|R
40|$|We study optimal tax and {{educational}} policies in a dynamic private information economy, in which ex-ante heterogeneous individuals make an educational investment {{early in their}} life and face a stochastic wage distribution. We characterize labor and education wedges in this setting analytically and numerically, using a calibrated example. We present ways to implement the optimum. In one implementation {{there is a common}} labor income tax schedule, and a repayment schedule for government loans given out to agents during education. These repayment plans are contingent on loan size and income and capture the history dependence of the labor wedges. Applying the model to US-data and a binary education decision (graduating from college or not) we characterize optimal labor wedges for individuals without college degree and with college degree. The labor wedge of college graduates as a function of income lies first strictly above their counterparts from high-school, but this reverses at higher incomes.

40|$|The Australian Government’s {{decision}} {{to raise taxes}} on ready-to-drink spirit-based beverages (RTDs; “alcopops”) in 2008 caused great controversy. Interest groups have selectively cited evidence to support their points of view. The alcohol industry cited Victorian data from the Australian Secondary Students’ Alcohol and Drug Survey (ASSADS) as evidence that the tax had failed, but closer examination of the data suggests that fewer students are drinking, and fewer are drinking at risky or high-risk levels. Excise data from the first full year after the tax came into effect showed a more than 30 % reduction in RTD sales and a 1. 5 % reduction in total pure alcohol sold in Australia. Although understanding the impact of the alcopops tax will require critical analysis of a range of evidence, sales and ASSADS data suggest that the tax has resulted in reduced consumption of RTDs and total alcohol. The most effective and cost-effective measures for reducing consumption and harm are a comprehensive <b>graduated</b> volumetric alcohol <b>taxation</b> system, a minimum price per standard drink, and special measures for particular products that may cause disproportionate harm. While welcoming the alcopops tax, public health advocates have consistently argued for a comprehensive package of reform that covers pricing, availability and promotion of alcohol, as well as education and treatment services...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{law school}} tax courses {{have been taught}} using a mix of problems, class discussion, the Socratic method, and one end-of-term exam. The goal of these courses is to {{introduce}} students to key concepts of tax law and to teach them the essential skill of reading and interpreting the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations. This traditional method of instruction is an efficient and cost-effective way of transmitting {{a great deal of}} complex information to a large number of students. It is also a good vehicle to teach the essential skill of reading and interpreting the Code. However, the time limitations inherent in the traditional methods of teaching do not require, or indeed permit, students to engage in the depth and quality of analysis that they will be asked to perform when they enter practice. In addition, students, while learning the Internal Revenue Code, are not instructed as to how they will use or apply the Code in their daily tax practices. In 2002, I developed a course in the <b>Graduate</b> Program in <b>Taxation</b> at the University of Washington School of Law, now entitled Tax Research and Writing, that has required students to learn tax law {{in a manner that is}} different from the traditional problem-based method. Through a series of written assignments, students wrestle with complex statutory and regulatory provisions, as well as caselaw and administrative materials, and then produce written products of the type and quality they will be required to produce in practice. More than teaching the “skills” of research and writing, the Tax Research and Writing assignments require the students to analyze, struggle with, and resolve tax questions at a different, and I would argue higher, level. My thesis in this article is that the traditional methods of teach tax law, standing alone, are not sufficient to properly prepare our students for the rigors of tax practice. Whenever practicable, tax professors should include writing assignments in their substantive courses that will necessitate each student to fully analyze the relevant Code provisions and create a written product that would be appropriate for their future practice. In Section I of the article, I will set forth the limitations inherent in the traditional methods of teaching tax law that prevent students from fully analyzing the Code. Section II will then set forth why I believe writing exercises are a superior way to teach legal analysis, including the analysis of tax law. My argument is that writing exercises teach legal analysis, not just some separate skill of writing, and that the analysis that students are able to perform under these conditions is superior to what they can perform in class. At the same time, writing assignments teach students the forms and norms of practice, and improve their writing, making them better prepared to be effective professionals when they enter the practice of law. In Section III of the article, I will introduce Tax Research and Writing course, including some of the assignments I have used and the goals of each of the assignments. Finally, in Section IV, I will provide suggestions on how legal writing assignments can be included in substantive tax courses...|$|R
