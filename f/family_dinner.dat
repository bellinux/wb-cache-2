He was exposed to politics from an early age; his father took him to several political rallies, including an 1895 speech by Democratic Party leader William Jennings Bryan. His father was a day laborer for the New Albany and St. Louis Air Line Railway. In 1898, he became disabled when he suffered heat stroke while working. His condition meant he could not work; the family became impoverished and had to subsist on the limited yield of their small farm. Minton's mother developed breast cancer in 1899.

25|$|On 29 January 1889, Franz Joseph and Elisabeth gave a <b>family</b> <b>dinner</b> party {{prior to}} leaving for Buda, in Hungary, on 31 January; Rudolf excused himself, {{claiming}} to be indisposed. He had arranged for a day's shooting at Mayerling early {{on the morning of}} the 30th, but when his valet Loschek went to call him, there was no answer. Count Joseph Hoyos, the Archduke's hunting companion, joined in, with no response. They tried to force the door, but it would not give. Finally Loschek smashed in a panel with an axe to find the room shuttered and half-dark. Rudolf was found sitting (by some accounts, lying) motionless by the side of the bed, leaning forward and bleeding from the mouth. Before him on the bedside table stood a glass and a mirror. Without closer examination in the poor light, Loschek assumed that the crown prince had drunk poison from the glass, since he knew strychnine caused bleeding. On the bed lay the body of Mary Vetsera, white, ice-cold, and already quite rigid. The mistaken impression that poison was involved, and even that the baroness had poisoned the crown prince and then killed herself, would persist for some time.|$|E

40|$|Kudos {{for family}} meals and {{turning off the}} TV Kudos for family meals and turning off the TV By Susan Nitzke A newly {{published}} study by Nicole Larson and others from the University of Minnesota shows that teens who eat meals with their families {{are more likely to}} make good food choices as they become young adults. Larson’s research group obtained food frequency questionnaires and surveys from 946 female students and 764 male high school students in 1998 - 99 and in 2003 - 04. Young adults who ate family meals more frequently during adolescence had higher intakes of fruit, vegetables, dark-green and orange vegetables and lower intakes of soft drinks than those who had eaten family meals less frequently. For the young women in this study, family meals in adolescence were associated with greater breakfast frequency. A review article in the same issue of this journal reported that family meals tend to decline as children get older and that teens and parents in families that had fewer <b>family</b> <b>dinners</b> (< 3 times per week) wished they had more <b>family</b> <b>dinners.</b> Boys eat <b>family</b> <b>dinners</b> more often than girls and <b>family</b> <b>dinners</b> are more frequent in homes with higher socioeconomic status...|$|R

Linda turns her away, but her fiancé, Dean's brother Mick Carter (Danny Dyer), later visits Ronnie and agrees to help her. However, he cannot go through with the plan at the last minute. Dean and Roxy decide to move away, upsetting Ronnie, so she gets Billy to rob his salon. However, Dean realises she was behind it, so proposes to Roxy in front of Ronnie. She tries to pay him off to leave, but he realises she is recording their conversation, so plays it to Roxy at their engagement party. They argue, and Ronnie smashes up the Albert bar, before she tells her relative Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) she is going to kill Dean. He warns Mick, and eventually Dean's parents Buster Briggs (Karl Howman) and Shirley, who arrive after Ronnie has given him a drink full of crushed up drugs. She reveals it was only a plan to scare him, but it is enough to make Roxy confess to Dean that Ronnie is a murderer, so he convinces Roxy to go to the police. Ronnie is seemingly arrested during a <b>family</b> <b>dinner</b> with the Mitchells. However, Ronnie realises they aren't police, and they drop her off in a wasteland, only for her to be picked up by Vincent.

She decides to confess to the police, but Vincent admits that he is a police informant, and Ronnie agrees to leave. However, Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) gives her a file he found in Vincent's safe, revealing he is working to take down the Mitchells.

Phil, who has returned to drinking, disowns Ronnie, but she still protects him when Vincent plants a gun on him and calls the police. After, Ronnie destroys the copies of her confession and keeps the gun, threatening to kill Vincent if he threatens her again.|$|E
