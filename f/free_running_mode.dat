Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), different effects generated by radiation from Nd:YAG (<b>free</b> <b>running</b> <b>mode)</b> and excimer lasers have been observed. With the Nd:YAG laser (lambda = 1. 06 mu m), reaction zone depths of several 100 nm, apparently caused by melting, were found. The excimer laser treatment with a lower penetration depth of the light (lambda = 248 nm) led to very low chemical surface damage. Thus the excimer laser is favored for exact micro machining of nitride ceramics...|$|E

In this study, we aimed to determine the summer comfort temperatures in offices in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, and Japan.

The survey revealed that 97 % of the responses in Japan were within the central three points of the TSV scale, but lower percentages were recorded in the other countries. In Singapore, 92. 9 % of the respondents were feeling either cold, cool, or slightly cool in their offices. In terms of adaptive behaviour, most of the occupants in Malaysia frequently used air-conditioning systems to maintain thermal comfort, while drinking cold beverages was more common in Indonesia and Japan. The high comfort temperature with MM ventilation could be influenced by the strong air movement and a wide range of adaptive options, such as opening windows and utilising air-conditioning systems...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of applications is proposed for the 24 GHz ISM-band, like automotive radar systems and short-range communication links. These applications demand for oscillators providing moderate output power of a few mW and moderate frequency stability of about 0. 5 %. The maximum oscillation frequency of low-cost off-theshelf transistors is too low for stable operation of a fundamental 24 GHz oscillator. Thus, we designed a 24 GHz first harmonic oscillator, where the power generated at the fundamental frequency (12 GHz) is reflected resulting in effective generation of output power at the first harmonic. We measured a radiated power from an integrated planar antenna of more than 1 mW. Though this oscillator provides superior frequency stability compared to fundamental oscillators, for some applications additional stabilization is required. As a low-cost measure, injection locking {{can be used to}} phase lock oscillators that provide sufficient stability in <b>free</b> <b>running</b> <b>mode.</b> Due to our harmonic oscillator concept injection locking has to be achieved at the first harmonic, since only the antenna is accessible for signal injection.

In addition, phase-noise improvement was investigated. A theoretical approach for the mechanism of first harmonic injection locking is presented...|$|E

Results-Three months after krypton photocoagulation 10 eyes showed a reduction or a complete regression of PDR and two eyes were unchanged.
