This study aims to determine, in vitro, the occurrence of Lenz forces on 9 heart valve prostheses at 1. 5 T and assess the risk of impedance of valve function. A specially designed hydro-pneumatic system was used to record pressure changes across the valve indicative of any MR <b>induced</b> <b>alteration</b> in leaflet performance. Nine cardiac valve prostheses were exposed to the B 0 field at 1. 5 T. Each valve was advanced through the B 0 field and continuous signals from high frequency pressure transducers were recorded and pressure drops across the valve were assessed using time correction superimposition. The delta p across the valve was assessed as a marker of any MRI <b>induced</b> <b>alteration</b> in leaflet performance. All prostheses produced sinusoidal waveforms. Profiles were asymmetrical and there was no consistency in complex shape and valve type/sub-group. Irregularities in pressure profiles of 4 prostheses were detected indicating resistance of the occluder to the B 0 field. This study provides empirical evidence of the Lenz Effect on cardiac valve prostheses exposed to the MR B 0 field causing functional valve impedance and increasing the risk of valvular regurgitation and reduced cardiac output. Thus, it is essential to consider the potential for the Lenz Effect when scanning cardiac valve implant patients in order to safeguard their wellbeing...|$|E

Because this method appears sensitive enough to signature low-dose effects, we examined how various test agents interact in binary mixtures to <b>induce</b> cell <b>alterations.</b> MCF- 7 cells were exposed for 24 h to low concentrations (10 − 12 M) of {{polybrominated diphenyl ether}} (PBDE) congeners (47, 153, 183, or 209) {{with or without the}} coplanar PCB 126 or nonplanar PCB 153. Following treatment, ethanol-fixed cellular material was interrogated using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy; derived IR spectra in the biochemical-cell fingerprint region (1800 cm− 1 − 900 cm− 1) were then subjected to principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis. Assuming that if two test agents independently induce the same cell alteration that in combination they’ll give rise to an additive effect, we examined predicted versus observed differences in <b>induced</b> <b>alterations</b> by binary mixtures. Compared to corresponding control clusters, treatment with PBDE congener plus PCB 126 appeared to cancel out their respective <b>induced</b> <b>alterations.</b> However, treatment with binary mixtures including PCB 153 gave rise to an enhanced segregation.

40|$|An in-situ X-ray {{transmission}} powder diffraction {{study of}} the kinetics of the light <b>induced</b> <b>alteration</b> of realgar (As 4 S 4) has been carried out. Data indicate that the crystalline final products of the process are pararealgar (different As 4 S 4 polymorph) and arsenolite (As 2 O 3). Because of the chemical unbalance the evolution of SOx, is hypothesized. In fact there are no evidences {{of the presence of}} amorphous As-S alloys or amorphous S. The alteration proceeds via the occurrence of an intermediate term along the β-As 4 S 4 -alacranite series joint with an estimated As 4 S 4. 2 composition. This phase reach a maximum wt. fraction of ca. 30 % {{in the early stages of}} the process and subsequently disappears. From the fraction X(t) of realgar and pararealgar transformed vs. time was determined the kinetic law of the digestion of realgar and formation of pararealgar according to the JMAK model. The refined n; parameters indicate that the behavior of the two transformations is intermediate between that of a diffusion-controlled and a first-• order model. The increased expansion of the realgar cell during the alteration could be possibly due to the requirement that structural coherency between at least two of the three sulfide phases is preserved. In particular the coherency between realgar and β-As 4 S 4 is expected to exist along arcaIgar*sin β and C βAsS 4 respectively. According to our data we may hypothesize that the light <b>induced</b> <b>alteration</b> of realgar to pararealgar occurs via an intermediate As 4 S 4 +x product because it is able to sustain the presence of As 4 S 5 -type cages. Following the model proposed by Kyono et al.

They can also be synergistic with fiber reinforcement to further improve the system performance. On the other hand, a new approach in structural health monitoring is to exploit the intrinsic properties of the material, such as electrical conductivity, optical properties etc, as sensing parameters. In this paper we present results concerning the strain sensing capabilities of iron/epoxy particulate composites at different percentages varying from 30 % to 60 % by weight. In particular, we investigate the strain <b>induced</b> <b>alteration</b> of the magnetic resistance (reluctance) of such polymers.

By using chemical proteomics approach, in which deubiquitinating enzymes were labeled by an active-site probe and analyzed by quantitative proteomics, we identified novel deubiquitinases in chicken macrophages based on their reactivity with the probe. Also, we detected down-regulation of UCH-L 3, and USP 4 as well as up-regulation of USP 5 and UCH-L 5 deubiquitinating enzymes in macrophages infected with Salmonella Typhimurium. We showed that decrease in either UCH-L 5 activity, or in UCH-L 5 protein amount in chicken and human macrophages infected or stimulated with LPS/nigericin, led to decreased IL- 1 β release. These data point towards a putative role of UCH-L 5 in inflammasome regulation during Salmonella infection. Because inflammasome activation is important in innate resistance to these bacteria, one would expect that naturally occurring or therapeutically <b>induced</b> <b>alteration</b> in UCH-L 5 activation would influence disease outcome and could represent a target for new therapeutic approaches...|$|E

Whether this cluster induces acute hemolysis or if it interacts with albumin remains unclear. The effect of acute exposure of human red blood cells to different concentrations of the cluster with and without albumin is described. Red blood cells from healthy donors were isolated, diluted at 1 % hematocrit and exposed to the cluster (25 – 150 µM) at 37 °C, under agitation. Hemolysis and morphology were analyzed at 1 and 24 h. The potential protection of 0. 1 % albumin was also evaluated. Exposition to therapeutic doses of the cluster did not induce acute hemolysis.
