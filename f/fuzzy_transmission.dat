Cheng Abstract: The paper proposes a QoS-guaranteed <b>fuzzy</b> <b>transmission</b> controller (FTC) for the dynamic TDMA protocol in multimedia communication systems. The dynamic TDMA protocol adopts a mini-slot technique for reducing contention cost, and the mini-slots are further partitioned into multiple MAC regions that users can access with their respective quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. The FTC mainly contains a Sugeno self-tuning fuzzy MAC threshold controller and a fuzzy access controller. The former applies a position-gradient-type reasoning method to properly determine the MAC regions; the latter employs max-min inference fuzzy logic {{to determine the}} access probabilities of users for enhancing dynamic TDMA efficiency under the QoS constraint. Simulation {{results show that the}} dynamic TDMA protocol with FTC can always guarantee the QoS requirement of real-time packet loss probability, regardless of the non-real-time traffic loads. Furthermore. it achieves higher system utilisation and less non-real-time packet delay compared to previously proposed PRMA, IPRMA and FRMA protocols. 1...|$|E

Among them, the so-called bidirectional associative memory network (BAMN) was invented and studied initially by a series of papers by Kosko [2, 3]. In the last three decades, BAMN created by Kosko was modified into the so-called fuzzy (delayed, resp. stochastic) BAMs to describe the the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>transmission</b> of information (aftereffect or memory, resp. stochastic perturbations) in the concerned BAMNs; see [4] and the vast references therein for more detail on the physical background of various BAMNs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Energy {{limitations}} {{have become}} fundamental challenge for designing WSNs. Network lifetime {{is the most}} interested and important metric in WSNs. Many works {{have been developed for}} prolonging networks lifetime, in which one of the important work is the control of transmission power. This paper proposes a new <b>fuzzy</b> <b>transmission</b> power control technique that operate together with routing protocols for prolonging WSNs lifetime. Dijkstra shortest path routing is considered as the main routing protocol in this work. This paper mainly focuses on transmission power control scheme for prolonging WSNs lifetime. A performance comparison is depicted for maximum and controlled transmission power. Simulation results show an increase in network lifetime equals to 3. 4776 for the proposed fuzzy control. The performance of the proposed fuzzy control technique involves a good improvement and contribution in the field of prolonging networks lifetime by using transmission power control...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{is a major}} issue of concern in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) as mobile nodes rely on batteries, which are limited source of power, and in several environments, it is quite unwieldy task to replace or renew them. Consideration of energy {{efficiency is}} very important in the design of routing protocols for MANETs. A cross-layer design approach is often used in designing energy efficient routing protocols. In this paper, a <b>fuzzy</b> adaptive <b>transmission</b> range at MAC layer and fuzzy threshold based power aware routing at network layer are used to design an energy efficient routing protocol implemented for Location Aided Routing (LAR). It is called <b>Fuzzy</b> Adaptive <b>Transmission</b> Range Based Power Aware Location Aided Routing (FTRPALAR). The simulation results are compared with that of LAR and variable transmission range power aware location aided routing (VTRPALAR).

The biggest characteristic of SBW system is that the transmission ratio is free to design. Based on the establishment of two-degree-freedom linear model of Forklift, the paper designed the nonlinear transmission ratio function on vehicle speed and steering angle with the application of fuzzy control rules. The simulation {{results show that the}} <b>fuzzy</b> variable <b>transmission</b> ratio can make the yaw velocity gain tend to be constant, also can make Forklift light sensitive at low speeds and steady heavy at high speed. In order to ensure that the yaw velocity gain does not vary with the change of speed and steering angle, this paper presents a dynamic correction control strategy based on the steady-state control for Forklift. The simulation results show that the amplitudes of yaw velocity and sideslip angle are reduced with the dynamic correction of yaw velocity feedback, also the handling stability is improved...|$|R

In several environments, it is quite unwieldy task to replace or renew them. Energy is limited factor in case of ad-hoc networks. Several routing algorithms have been proposed to make routing energy efficient. A cross layer design approach is often used in designing energy efficient routing protocols.

40|$|Due to {{the need}} for {{aviation}} safety, convenience, and efficiency, the autopilot has been introduced into the cockpit. The fast development of the autopilot has brought great benefits to the aviation industry. On the human side, the flight deck has been designed to be a complex, tightly-coupled, and spatially distributed system. The problem of dysfunctional interaction between the pilot and the automation (human-automation interaction issue) has become more and more visible. Thus, detection of a mismatch between the pilot 2 ̆ 7 s expectation and automation 2 ̆ 7 s behavior in a timely manner is required. In order to solve this challenging problem, separate modeling of the pilot and the automation is necessary. In this thesis, an intent-based framework is introduced to detect the human-automation interaction issue. Under this framework, the pilot 2 ̆ 7 s expectation of the aircraft is modeled by pilot intent while the behavior of the automation system is modeled by automation intent. The mode confusion is detected when the automation intent differs from the pilot intent. The pilot intent is inferred by comparing the target value set by the pilot with the aircraft 2 ̆ 7 s current state. Meanwhile, the automation intent is inferred through the Generalized Fuzzy Hidden Markov Model (GFHMM), which is an extension of the classical Hidden Markov Model. The stochastic characteristic of the "hidden 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 intents is considered by introducing fuzzy logic. Different from the previous approaches of inferring automation intent, GFHMM does not require a probabilistic model for certain flight modes as prior knowledge. The parameters of GFHMM (initial fuzzy density of the intent, <b>fuzzy</b> <b>transmission</b> density, and fuzzy emission density) are determined through the flight data by using a machine learning technique, the Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm (FCM). Lastly, both the pilot 2 ̆ 7 s and automation 2 ̆ 7 s intent inference algorithms and the mode confusion detection method are validated through flight data. ...|$|E
