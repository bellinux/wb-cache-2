50|$|Although {{reasonably}} {{specific to}} the liver and a more sensitive marker for cholestatic damage than ALP, gamma <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> (GGT) may be elevated with even minor, subclinical levels of liver dysfunction.

50|$|Most {{patients}} presenting with jaundice {{will have}} various predictable patterns of liver panel abnormalities, though significant variation does exist. The typical liver panel will include {{blood levels of}} enzymes found primarily from the liver, such as the aminotransferases (ALT, AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP); bilirubin (which causes the jaundice); and protein levels, specifically, total protein and albumin.

FibroSure uses quantitative results of five serum biochemical markers, α2-macroglobulin, haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A1, bilirubin, gamma <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> (GGT), with a patient’s age and gender to generate a measure of fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity in the liver.|$|E
40|$|High {{levels of}} gamma <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> and {{alkaline}} phosphatase {{were found in}} T-tube bile from patients undergoing cholecystectomy and exploration of the common bile duct for gallbladder and/or ductal stones for up to 9 days after operation. The activities of these enzymes and leucine aminopeptidase were higher in bile than in serum obtained {{during the period of}} bile drainage. The patterns of bile activity were different for all 3 enzymes. Gamma <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> activity reached a maximum 3 days after operation and then gradually declined, while alkaline phosphatase activity increased progressively for 8 days although values appeared to plateau between Days 7 and 9. There was, however, no significant linear correlation between the mean values of these enzymes. Smaller and more variable changes were observed in the activity of leucine aminopeptidase but on average the levels of this enzyme continued to increase throughout the collection period, and correlated significantly with the values for the other 2 enzymes. Although the high activities of alkaline phosphatase may be due to induction of this enzyme in the liver, the presence of gamma <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> and leucine aminopeptidase in the bile is probably a result of continuing hepatic injury. It appears that bile is used as a major route for the elimination of at least these 3 enzymes from damaged tissue in the liver. However, this biliary excretion is probably rather slow and {{does not appear to be}} sufficient to prevent the prolonged high levels of serum gamma <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> that have been observed following surgical correction of large duct obstruction...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite the {{extensive}} research {{for many years}} throughout the world, the etiopathogenesis of cancer still remains obscure. For the early detection of carcinoma of various origins, a number of biochemical markers have been studied to evaluate the malignancy. AIM: To analyse serum gamma <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> (GGTP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in carcinoma breast patients. SETTINGS &#x 0026; DESIGN: The serum biochemical markers were estimated in twenty five histopathologically confirmed patients with carcinoma breast and equal number of healthy age- matched individuals served as control. MATERIAL &#x 0026; METHODS: Serum gamma <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> (GGTP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were estimated and their sensitivity determined. Statistics: Data was analysed with student&#x 2032;s &#x 2032;t&#x 2032;-test and sensitivity score of these markers was determined. RESULTS &#x 0026; CONCLUSIONS: The mean serum GGTP, LDH and SOD activities in patients with carcinoma breast were tremendously increased as compared to controls, and a steady increase was observed in their activities from stage I through stage IV as well as following distant metastasis. Serum GGTP, LDH and SOD might prove to be most sensitive biomarkers in carcinoma breast in early detection of the disease...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{reduction}} in serum enzymes has been already observed by administering ursodeoxycholic acid {{to patients with}} chronic active hepatitis. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess whether the Liver histological activity of inflammation was modified by a 12 -month treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid. Thirty-six patients with chronic active hepatitis, fulfilling the inclusion criteria, were admitted to the trial. Patients were randomly allocated to receive double blind either 600 mg/day of ursodeoxycholic acid (Group A: 18 patients) or placebo (Group B: 18 patients). Clinical and biochemical follow-up was performed at 3 -month intervals. A percutaneous liver biopsy was performed before and after 1 year of treatment. Histological hepatitis activity was assessed using Knodell's numerical scoring system, while biliary damage was evaluated by an appropriate scoring system. Sixteen and 12 patients in Groups A and B, respectively, completed the clinical and biochemical follow-up. Although a {{reduction in}} serum enzymes was found in both groups, multifactorial covariance analysis showed that the reductions in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> were significantly higher in Group A than in Group B. Biochemical remission was not observed in either group. Histological analysis showed a dichotomy between the results from the hepatitis and the biliary components of the disease process. No differences were found in the two groups before or after treatment in histological activity index, which measures the ''hepatitic'' component. Nor were there any significant differences in baseline values. Furthermore, no relationship was found between changes in biochemical parameters and the histological activity indices. In contrast, the ''biliary'' component showed significant improvement after ursodeoxycholic acid treatment for certain cholestatic parameters: ductular metaplasia, bile duct damage and phenotypic cytokeratin changes. These changes were significantly associated with changes in gamma <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> serum levels. This study has confirmed that ursodeoxycholic acid administration in patients with chronic active hepatitis reduces transaminases and gamma <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase.</b> The morphological substrate of this biochemical improvement can be traced to the biliary component of the process.

40|$|Contribution of γ <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> to {{oxidative}} damage of ischemic rat kidney. BackgroundA variety of mechanisms {{have been considered}} in the pathogenesis of the cell damage occurring in the kidney that is undergoing transient ischemia. However, little information is available {{about the role of}} oxidative stress in building up the tissue injury in the hypoxic organ during short-term ischemia. MethodsAfter a standard brief period (25 min) of unilateral kidney ischemia in rats, pretreated or not with acivicin (60 μmol/L/kg i. v.), tissue samples from both ischemic and not ischemic kidneys were obtained to measure malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) content, γ <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> (GGT) activity by spectrophotometry, localization and intensity of enzyme activity, and tissue damage by histochemistry. ResultsGGT activity was found to be increased in both cortical and medullar zones of the ischemic kidneys, where the GSH level was only slightly decreased and the MDA level, in contrast, was markedly increased; in parallel, the cytosolic volume of the proximal tubular (PT) cells showed a significant increment. The animal pretreatment with acivicin, a specific inhibitor of GGT, besides preventing the up-regulation of the enzyme during ischemia, afforded good protection against the observed changes of MDA and GSH tissue levels, as well as of tubular cell volume. ConclusionsEx vivo data supporting a net pro-oxidant effect of up-regulated GGT during short-term ischemia of rat kidney have been obtained. The enzyme stimulation appears to contribute to the renal morphological damage exerted by a brief hypoxic condition at the level of PT cells. The actual impact on kidney function by GGT-dependent {{oxidative damage}} during transient ischemia and the potential protective action of GGT inhibitors require subsequent investigation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Gamma <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> (GGT) is a transferase, {{which is}} of great {{importance}} in sustaining intracellular cysteine and glutathione levels. The abnormal expression of GGT is significantly associated with features of many metabolic syndromes (e. g., hepatocellular carcinoma). Therefore, {{it is essential to}} develop methods to detect GGT so as to monitor the physiological or pathological phenomena related to this species. In this work, by making use of a complex formed by Cu 2 + and glutathione, which may exhibit excellent voltammetric response, we have proposed a novel potential electrochemical method for the detection of the enzyme. Results show that in the presence of GGT, the formation of Cu 2 +-glutathione complex on a working electrode will be disrupted, resulting in greatly depressed electrochemical signals. The primary method exhibits some advantages, such as it being fast, cost-efficient, and conveniently operated. It also {{has the potential to be}} further developed as an effective method in the quantitative detection of GGT in real samples...|$|E
