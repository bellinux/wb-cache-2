5|$|Ions {{typically}} pack into extremely regular crystalline structures, in {{an arrangement}} that minimizes the lattice energy (maximizing attractions and minimizing repulsions). The lattice energy is the summation of the interaction of all sites with all other sites. For unpolarizable spherical ions only the charges and distances are required to determine the electrostatic <b>interaction</b> <b>energy.</b> For any particular ideal crystal structure, all distances are geometrically related to the smallest internuclear distance. So for each possible crystal structure, the total electrostatic energy {{can be related to}} the electrostatic energy of unit charges at the nearest neighbour distance by a multiplicative constant called the Madelung constant that can be efficiently computed using an Ewald sum. When a reasonable form is assumed for the additional repulsive energy, the total lattice energy can be modelled using the Born–Landé equation, the Born–Mayer equation, or in the absence of structural information, the Kapustinskii equation.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{performance}} of gradient-free local density approximation (LDA) and gradient-dependent generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals in a density functional theory variational calculations based on the total energy bifunctional (E[1, 2]). These approximations are applied to the exchange-correlation energy and to the nonadditive component of the kinetic energy of the complex. Benchmark ab initio <b>interaction</b> <b>energies</b> taken from the literature for 25 intermolecular complexes for which the <b>interaction</b> <b>energies</b> fall into the 0. 1 – 3. 0 kcal/mol range are used as reference. At the GGA level, the <b>interaction</b> <b>energies</b> derived from E[1, 2] are more accurate than the Kohn–Sham ones. LDA leads to very good <b>interaction</b> <b>energies</b> for such complexes where the 1, 2 overlap is very small (Ne-Ne, Ar-Ar, for instance) {{but it is not}} satisfactory for such cases where the overlap is larger. Introduction of gradient-dependent terms into the approximate part of E[1, 2] improves significantly the overall accuracy of the <b>interaction</b> <b>energies.</b> Gradient-dependent functionals applied in E[1, 2] lead to the average error and the average absolute error of the <b>interaction</b> <b>energies</b> amounting to 0. 08 kcal/mol and 0. 29 kcal/mol, respectively...|$|R
25|$|In the {{original}} Franck–Condon principle, after the electronic transition, the molecules which {{end up in}} higher vibrational states immediately begin to relax to the lowest vibrational state. In the case of solvation, the solvent molecules will immediately try to rearrange themselves {{in order to minimize}} the <b>interaction</b> <b>energy.</b> The rate of solvent relaxation depends on the viscosity of the solvent. Assuming the solvent relaxation time is short compared with the lifetime of the electronic excited state, emission will be from the lowest solvent energy state of the excited electronic state. For small-molecule solvents such as water or methanol at ambient temperature, solvent relaxation time is on the order of some tens of picoseconds whereas chromophore excited state lifetimes range from a few picoseconds to a few nanoseconds. Immediately after the transition to the ground electronic state, the solvent molecules must also rearrange themselves to accommodate the new electronic configuration of the chromophore. Figure 7 illustrates the Franck–Condon principle applied to solvation. When the solution is illuminated by with light corresponding to the electronic transition energy, some of the chromophores will move to the excited state. Within this group of chromophores there will be a statistical distribution of solvent-chromophore interaction energies, represented in the figure by a Gaussian distribution function. The solvent-chromophore interaction is drawn as a parabolic potential in both electronic states. Since the electronic transition is essentially instantaneous on the time scale of solvent motion (vertical arrow), the collection of excited state chromophores is immediately far from equilibrium. The rearrangement of the solvent molecules according to the new potential energy curve is represented by the curved arrows in Figure 7. Note that while the electronic transitions are quantized, the chromophore-solvent <b>interaction</b> <b>energy</b> is treated as a classical continuum due to the large number of molecules involved. Although emission is depicted as taking place from the minimum of the excited state chromophore-solvent interaction potential, significant emission can take place before equilibrium is reached when the viscosity of the solvent is high or the lifetime of the excited state is short. The energy difference between absorbed and emitted photons depicted in Figure 7 is the solvation contribution to the Stokes shift.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{polymeric}} mixtures are {{far less}} miscible than mixtures of small molecule materials. This effect results {{from the fact that}} the driving force for mixing is usually entropy, not <b>interaction</b> <b>energy.</b> In other words, miscible materials usually form a solution not because their interaction with each other is more favorable than their self-interaction, but because of an increase in entropy and hence free energy associated with increasing the amount of volume available to each component. This increase in entropy scales with the number of particles (or moles) being mixed. Since polymeric molecules are much larger and hence generally have much higher specific volumes than small molecules, the number of molecules involved in a polymeric mixture is far smaller than the number in a small molecule mixture of equal volume. The energetics of mixing, on the other hand, is comparable on a per volume basis for polymeric and small molecule mixtures. This tends to increase the free energy of mixing for polymer solutions and thus make solvation less favorable. Thus, concentrated solutions of polymers are far rarer than those of small molecules.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{external}} magnetic field, the ground and excited states are split by the magnetic interaction between the two unpaired electrons at the N-V− center (see microscopic model): when two electrons have parallel spins (ms=±1), their energy is higher than when spins are antiparallel (ms=0). The farther apart the electrons are, the weaker their <b>interaction</b> <b>energy</b> D (roughly Dnbsp&~1/r3). Thus the smaller splitting in the excited state can be viewed in terms of larger electron-electron separation in the excited state. When an external magnetic field is applied to the N-V− center, it does not affect the ms=0 states nor the 1A state (because it has Snbsp&= 0), but it splits the msnbsp&= ±1 levels. If a magnetic field is oriented along the defect axis and reaches about 1027 G (or 508 G) then the msnbsp&= –1 and msnbsp&= 0 states in the ground (or excited) state become equal in energy; they strongly interact resulting in so-called spin polarization, which strongly affects the intensity of optical absorption and luminescence transitions involving those states.|$|E
