25|$|The {{adjective}} Orwellian connotes {{an attitude}} and {{a policy of}} control by propaganda, surveillance, misinformation, denial of truth, and manipulation of the past. In Nineteen Eighty-Four Orwell described a totalitarian government that controlled thought by controlling language, making certain ideas literally unthinkable. Several words and phrases from Nineteen Eighty-Four have entered popular language. Newspeak is a simplified and obfuscatory language designed to make independent thought impossible. Doublethink means holding two contradictory beliefs simultaneously. The Thought Police are those who suppress all dissenting opinion. Prolefeed is <b>homogenised,</b> manufactured superficial literature, film and music, used to control and indoctrinate the populace through docility. Big Brother is a supreme dictator who watches everyone.|$|E

40|$|The work {{presents}} a psychodynamic, semiotic and dialogical model of affect {{and of the}} role it plays in sensemaking. The model {{is based on the}} following three general assumptions. A) Affective semiosis works in accordance to the dynamic unconscious which Freud conceptualized in terms of primary process. According to this interpretation, the unconscious is the mind’s <b>homogenising</b> way of functioning, which transforms every categorical relation into a relation of identity. B) Affect is the generalized, <b>homogenising</b> and absolutizing embodied basic intersubjective meanings according to which experience is interpreted. C) Affective semiosis performs both the grounding and regulative functions in sensemaking, orienting the way people interpret experience...|$|R

25|$|The chiffon sari {{did what}} years of fashion {{interaction}} {{had not done}} in India. It <b>homogenised</b> fashion across this land. Its softness, lightness and beautiful, elegant, caressing drape was ideally suited to the Indian climate. Different courts adopted their own styles of draping and indigenising the sari. In most of the courts the sari was embellished with stitching hand-woven borders in gold from Varanasi, delicate zardozi work, gota, makaish and tilla work that embellished the plain fabric, simultaneously satisfying both traditional demands and ingrained love for ornamentation. Some images of maharanis in the Deccan show the women wearing a sleeveless, richly embellished waistcoat over their blouses. The Begum of Savanur remembers how sumptuous the chiffon sari became at their gatherings. At some courts it was worn with jaali, or net kurtas and embossed silk waist length sadris or jackets. Some of them were so rich that the entire ground was embroidered over with pearls and zardozi.|$|E
500|$|Although early {{assertions of}} being British {{date from the}} Late Middle Ages, the {{creation}} of the united Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 triggered a sense of British national identity. The notion of Britishness was forged during the Napoleonic Wars between Britain and the First French Empire, and developed further during the Victorian era. The complex history of the formation of the United Kingdom created a [...] "particular sense of nationhood and belonging" [...] in Great Britain and Ireland; Britishness became [...] "superimposed on much older identities", of English, Scots, Welsh and Irish cultures, whose distinctiveness still resists notions of a <b>homogenised</b> British identity. Because of longstanding ethno-sectarian divisions, British identity in Northern Ireland is controversial, but it is held with strong conviction by Unionists.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the ability}} of a boiling process to {{thermally}} condition (homogenisation and cooling) batteries is investigated. Thereto, a series of experiments are performed and discussed. Subjects that are treated are the dielectric property of the proposed cooling uid, its cooling capability compared to that of air, {{the ability of}} the boiling uid to thermally <b>homogenise</b> a battery and the influence of pressure variation on the boiling process. It turns out that the proposed cooling fluid conducts no electricity, has good cooling characteristics compared to those of air and, when boiling, is able to thermally <b>homogenise</b> the battery.

Phase composition of the alloy following various stages of processing it into the specified semi-finished product was being determined too. It was demonstrated that the application of cold plastic deformation between solution treatment and ageing could significantly enhance the effect of hardening of the Cu- 3 Ti alloy without deteriorating its electrical conductivity. It was found that for the investigated alloy the selection of appropriate conditions for <b>homogenising</b> treatment, hot and cold deformation as well as solution treatment and ageing enables to obtain the properties {{comparable to those of}} beryllium bronzes...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th European Conference EUROMAT 2001, Rimini, 10 - 14 june 2001 International audienceA model is developed for the prediction of the microstructure evolution of cast alloys during its industrial process route. The materials under consideration are binary aluminium-copper alloys. The process are casting, <b>homogenising</b> and ageing. A suite of models is built, which successively calculates microsegregation taking place duríng solidification and homogenisation, and precipitation occurring during ageing of the alloy. As a final output, the model permits the final yield stress of the material to be calculated {{as a function of}} the process parameters (i. e., casting cooling rate, inoculation of the alloy, duration and temperature of the <b>homogenising</b> and ageing heat treatments). This is made possible by introducing a structural hardening model between the diffusion driven phase transformation models and a final mechanical model for heterogeneous materials...|$|R
