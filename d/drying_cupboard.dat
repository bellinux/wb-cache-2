50|$|The two bed flats were {{originally}} separated from one bed flats with glazed timber {{doors at the}} ends of the 6 feet (1.8m) wide corridors. The doors were removed in a fire life safety upgrade except the original 12AB Penthouse apartment which remains. The wide corridors {{were originally}} painted bright reds, oranges and yellow, and the lobby bright green. Ends of the corridors were originally patterned wall paper. The original carpet was black and white with purple flecks. The early residents apparently disliked the bright 1960s colours and they were repainted in neutral tones as today. The corridors were originally lit using borrowed daylight from clerestory windows to each flat. At nighttime the corridors were lit with fluorescent tube fittings at right angle to the corridor which is unconventional and these have been replaced with energy efficient light-emitting diode (LED) fittings in the same unconventional arrangement in 2013. Originally each flat was fitted with a decorative screen door of wrought iron scrolls and these were replaced with security screen doors when each flat was fitted with a fire rated door in the 90s fire life safety upgrade. Originally Edgewater Towers' residents had use of two common area laundries on each floor (24 total), each fitted with automatic washing machine, clothes dryer, sink, <b>drying</b> <b>cupboard,</b> instantaneous hot water heater and incinerator chute. Currently there are 6 working laundries and the remaining 18 converted to bike storage (55 bikes). One of the original two incinerator chutes remains in use as the garbage disposal chute. Edgewater Towers has had an interior renovation 2010-14.|$|E
5000|$|Both blocks {{demonstrate}} {{a different approach}} to concrete construction, the Tower block being a relatively standard example of a reinforced concrete structure of the late 1950s, while the Garden block employed the new ‘lift slab construction' system, {{the first of its kind}} in Queensland. The term lift-slab defines a style of construction in which each floor, and the roof are pre-fabricated on the ground in a stack and raised into position along vertical wall supports. [...] The external walls are cavity brick and provide an aesthetically domestic cladding for the building, as well as providing insulative properties. Internal walls dividing apartments were of a double brick construction to reduce sound transfer, while walls within apartments were of a non-load bearing nature to allow for simple future renovations.Different room configurations were also made possible off the plan. Provisions were made for television points (TV was relatively new) and each apartment had a gas clothes <b>drying</b> <b>cupboard</b> and the building boasted a filtered water supply via rooftop tanks. A garbage chute was available on every floor in both towers and rubbish was originally incinerated via a basement incinerator on level B1 which was ignited at night time so that the smoke out of the tower block rooftop was less visible. The building used to ( [...] and may still have) a postal box in the lobby in order to mail letters and mail is delivered to each floor by Australia Post rather than to central mailboxes in the lobby as with modern buildings. The rooftop observation deck, a common area for all residents, was originally designed to be a cocktail lounge however these plans never materialised. In order to purchase an apartment off the plan, an initial deposit was required and then scheduled progress payments fell due at certain points during the construction until the balance was due upon completion. One monthly fee per apartment covers council rates, water and association/ maintenance and administration fees. Potential buyers could also see their potential view via helicopter at one stage during construction. Apparently there was little security in the early years and Highgate Hill locals used to walk through the lobby off Dornoch Tce and exit on Chermside St via the Garden Block lift as a short cut. The original Tower Block internal lift doors contained a small rectangular window through which you could see the various floors, concrete and brickwork pass by as you travelled between floors.|$|E
5000|$|Pre-WW-I cabinet design. Typical kitchens before World War I used {{freestanding}} work {{tables and}} a pantry for <b>dry</b> storage. <b>Cupboards</b> were sometimes used in kitchens, though in larger houses dishes were more typically {{stored in the}} dining room or butler's pantry. Perishable foods such as milk, meat, and vegetables were purchased daily.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{its high}} sugar concentration, {{bacteria}} are not usually able to grow in candy. As a result, the shelf life is longer for candy than for many other foods. Most candies can be safely stored in their original packaging at room temperature in a <b>dry,</b> dark <b>cupboard</b> for months or years. As a rule, the softer the candy or the damper the storage area, the sooner it goes stale.|$|R
50|$|More {{than one}} washing machine is usually installed. They are often larger than private washing {{machines}} found in individual households, and more durable to withstand daily use. Drying facilities often include a tumble dryer or <b>drying</b> cabinet/drying <b>cupboard</b> (image) {{and a separate}} (warm-air assisted) drying room, where clothes are hung on washing lines. There may be {{one or more of}} each. A standalone centrifuge (or spinner) is often found, either if one or more washing machines don't have such a function or for residents washing garments by hand. It extracts the bulk of the water in minutes, minimizing the time subsequently needed in the dryer. Other facilities may include sinks for washing by hand, a mangle (wringer), a washboard, paper towel and trolleys (carts) for transporting laundry to the drying facilities. A tvättstuga also has a social dimension - a place where conversation can arise between neighbours without discomfort.|$|R
40|$| {{that are}} being {{passaged}} are unable {{to adjust to the}} pH of the medium for an amount of time prior to attachment and re-initiation of metabolic activity. The passage time is a particularly critical period that can be achieved by prewarming the flask that contains growth medium in a CO 2 incubator or aseptically gassing each flask with 5 % CO 2. - Mitomycin-C should be stored in the dark since it is readily decomposed by light. - Caution: i. Appropriate protection must be done while working with mitomycin-c. Wearing suitable protection is recommended. - Mounting media - Slides are mounted in PBS/glycerol (1 : 1). - Caution: First, check components for auto fluorescence. Residual auto fluorescent mounting medium can be removed by the offset of imaging software. Once aqueous mounting media is made, it should be stored in small (10 - 30 ml) screw-capped bottles or vials made of transparent glass or plastic. - Preparation of thymidine - ii. Dissolve 0. 1816 g of thymidine powder in 10 ml PBS to give a 75 mM thymidine solution (stock solution). - iii. Add 100 µl of stock solution to 3 ml of culture medium (final thymidine concentration is 2. 5 mM). ### Procedure mESC culture medium preparation: General culture conditions are well established 11 and usually require ES (embryonic stem) cells to be grown on a Mit-C (M 0503; Sigma, Germany) treated mitotically-inactive mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (mEF) as feeder cell layer in a gelatin (G 2500; Sigma) -coated tissue culture flask (90025; TPP) [Fig. 1]. mESC line RB 1 12 maintained in ES cell medium consisted of Knockout-DMEM (10829 - 018; Gibco, UK) supplemented with 15 % ES-qualified FCS (10439 - 024; Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine (15039 - 027; Gibco), 0. 1 mM 2 -mercaptoethanol (M 7522; Sigma), 1 % nonessential amino acid stock (11140 - 035; Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (15070 - 063; Gibco). Tip: Mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (mEF) are used in co-cultures to provide secreted factors (paracrine element), extracellular matrix (juxtacrine signaling) and cellular contacts for the maintenance of stem cells in an undifferentiated state without losing their pluripotency. Thus, they are also called feeder cells. Subculture of the cells - i. Prewarm all reagents. - ii. Aspirate all medium from the culture vessel. - iii. Rinse the culture twice with 2 ml PBS-, gently rock the vessel for 30 sec and remove the buffer to dispose of all traces of medium containing FBS. - iv. Add the appropriate amount of trypsin to each flask to cover the entire surface of the flask. Incubate the culture at room temperature for approximately 1 minute. Rock the flask for 4 - 5 times quickly back and forth such that the trypsin coats the cells. After 1 minute incubation, wash the culture vigorously by pipetting the trypsin solution up and down over the cells such that the small amount of fluid in the flask shears the loosely attached cells off and dissociates the clumps. - v. Inactive the trypsin by adding fresh, complete medium. Be sure to triturate thoroughly to achieve a single cell suspension before inactivating. Replate as desired. Synchronization protocol for mESCs - i. Add 2 mM thymidine for 16 hours at 25 - 30 % confluency of the stem cell culture. - ii. Remove thymidine by washing with 1 x PBS. Add fresh KO-DMEM complete medium for 4 hours to release cells. Cells progress synchronously through the G 2 - and mitotic phases. Hypotonization Based on criteria by Fenech 13 for the selection of bi-nucleate cells suitable for scoring MNi, a bi-nucleate cell can be scored only if the nuclear boundaries of each nucleus are distinguishable. In addition, the cytoplasmic membrane of bi-nucleated cells must be intact and clearly distinct from adjacent cells. Thus, it is important that mESCs harvested properly without any damage to the cytoplasmic membrane. Micronucleus assay in isolated lymphocyte or cell lines culture does not require hypotonic treatment during harvesting. Hypotonic treatment may destroy necrotic and apoptotic cells, making them unavailable for assay 13. On the other hand, mESCs have a large nucleus surrounded by a narrow rim of cytoplasm. According to the all above items mentioned it seems the hypotonic treatment of mESCs is necessary and cannot be omitted. Harvest & slide making - i. Treat ES cells grown on mEF with 4 µg/ml cyt-B (c- 6762; Sigma) for 14 hours. - ii. Trypsinize the cells and spin them down at 800 g for 6 minutes. - iii. Resuspend the cell pellet gently by tapping the tube. Add about 4 ml of hypotonic solution. - iv. After a 10 minute incubation at room temperature, spin down the cells again and fix the pellet with cool Carnoy`s fixative (methanol: acetic acid; 3 : 1) for 15 minutes at room temperature. Disperse cells before the addition of fixative. - v. Change the fixative twice. - vi. Drop the suspension on wet slides previously cleaned with ethanol. - vii. Air-dry the slides. Stain with Hoechst 33258 (Calbiochem; 382061) and rhodamin B (Sigma; R 6626). - viii. Examine slides under a microscope equipped with fluorescent optic (Olympus Bx 51). Cells are scored blindly for MN presence. In our study, the frequency was expressed as number of MNi per one bi-nucleated cell (mean± SD). Critical: Do not air-dry slides for longer than 10 minutes, otherwise cell and molecular morphology become altered, it makes difficult to score the slides. Store the slides in a microscope slide box in a cool, <b>dry</b> and dust-free <b>cupboard.</b> Scoring: We examined one thousand bi-nucleated cells to measure MN formation in each slide prepared per sample (treated and control). For more details, we followed the Fenech 13. Pause point: Fluorescent stained slides can be stored at 4 ºC for 1 month. Criteria of micronuclei screening MNi are morphologically identical to, but smaller than nuclei and have the following characteristics: - (a) The diameter of MNi in human lymphocytes usually varies between 1 / 16 and 1 / 3 of the mean diameter of the main nuclei, which is corresponded to 1 / 256 and 1 / 9 of the main nuclei area in a BN cell, respectively. - (b) MNi are non-refractile and therefore, can be readily distinguished from artifacts such as staining particles. - (c) MNi are not linked or connected to the main nuclei. - (d) MNi may touch but not overlap the main nuclei. The micronuclear boundary should be distinguishable from the nuclear boundary. - (e) MNi usually have the same staining intensity as the main nuclei [Fig. 2], but occasionally their staining may be more intense 13 (For review see Fenech, 2007). Statistical analysis: We used the t-test to evaluate MN formation induced by genotoxic agents. ### Timing - Monday (8 am- 8 pm); during this period mESCs seeded on mEF and make small colonies. - Monday-Tuesday (8 pm- 12 am); inoculate thymidine to each flask and incubate for 16 h to achieve synchronized mESCs. - Tuesday (12 am- 4 pm); Wash to release from the thymidine block and incubate for 4 hours with fresh medium. - Tuesday-Wednesday (4 pm- 8 am) in which cells are cultured for 14 h in media containing Cyt-B. - Note: Cells that suffer any type of cytotoxic and genotoxic shock may go into cell cycle arrest, thus bi-nucleate cells become less than expected. It must be borne in mind that after any treatment, the cell cycle becomes longer than before. ### Troubleshooting - Screening criteria - To keep mESCs growing with maintenance of differentiation potency, they definitely need to grow on a feeder layer (mitotically inactivated mEF). Therefore, at the time of screening the slides, how should one distinguish between mESCs and feeder cells? - There is a tremendous difference between the nuclei of these two cell types that cannot be overlooked. The nuclei of mESCs are smaller than fibroblastic cells and are round, too. Feeder cells have oval nuclei which are sometimes fragmented. The ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm in mESCs is larger than feeder cells. - At the time of feeder layer preparation from fibroblastic cells, they must become mitotically inactivated by mitomycin-c treatment or gamma irradiation; therefore these cells do not undergo further proliferation. During screening, there will not be any telophasic mEF cells in prepared slides, thus all the bi-nucleated cells are stem cells. - Slides crowded with cells that clumped - Excessive amount of cell suspension was used. - Dilute the cell suspension with additional fixative. - Cell pellet was not dispersed before the addition of fixative. - Loosen final cell pellet vigorously either before or just after addition of fixative. - Too few/no bi-nucleated cells; - Thymidine was inadequately removed. - Continue washing cells with fresh medium. - Cell Lysis was occurred during fixation steps. - Do not vortex or vigorously shake the cell pellet in fixative. - The Cells progressed through telophase. - Increase cytochalasin-B concentration or incubation time. - Cells membrane lysis occurred. - Do not vortex or vigorously shake the cell pellets during fixation steps. Re-suspend the cells gently by tapping the tube. - Add cool fixative drop wise during first fixation step. - Micronucleus boundary is overlapped with the nuclear boundary; - Cells were insufficiently swollen. - Check the KCl hypotonic solution. Increase the time/temperature of incubation in hypotonic solution. - Existence of three or more nucleated cells; - The time of incubation with cyt-B was too long. - Adjust the culture time until bi-nucleated cells appear. ### Anticipated Results The cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMn) is a reliable and relatively easy method used for many years by scientists for biological assessments. Relative accuracy, simplicity, multi-potentiality, large tissue applicability of CBMn assay technology and its potency to become automated have made it a fascinating technology during last decades and will {{play a key role in}} mutagenicity assessment in the future. This technique is mostly used for lymphocytes and it has been not provided for embryonic stem cells study. In our study, routine CBMn led to unacceptable, substandard, unexplainable results. Although the entire process was based on the standard methods, however most of the mESCs population underwent DNA fragmentation [Fig. 3]! To avoid occurrence of this problem, factors that might contribute to DNA fragmentation of mESCs in some circumstances such as attachment factors 14 - 16, LIF concentration 17, cyt-B concentration 18, 19 were considered, however no significant effect were found. It has been showed that incubation of mESCs with cytochalasin-B (an anti-actin drug) caused marked alterations in cell shape and cytoskeletal organization 19. We observed same results in our study, that after treatment of mESCs colonies with Cyt-B, the cell attachment to each other and feeder layer (mEF) were essentially reduced, cells rounded up, and consequently cells were disaggregated. It has been postulated that single cell suspensions of mESCs lead to leakage oxidative phosphorilation components from mitochondria, these cells finally become committed to apoptosis, whereas this process was suppressed when they proliferated in aggregates 20. According to above descriptions, modification of the timing of the standard protocol of CBMn assay for mESCs is the best way to solve this problem because reducing the incubation time, decrease the chance of detachment of cells from substrate. Tauchi et al. showed that the best time for apoptosis analysis is 16 hours after treatment with toxic agents when there is a raise in the apoptosis rate and approximately most of the apoptotic cells are in the late stage of apoptosis 21. We have observed the same outcome in mESCs (Results not showed). ...|$|R
