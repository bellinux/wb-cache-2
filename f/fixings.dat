5|$|At {{the north}} of the island are the remains of a 19th-century wharf {{including}} concrete tracks, rock cutting and iron <b>fixings</b> (several brackets and stumps). A concrete helipad west of the lighthouse was constructed in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|On Monday 10 March 2008 {{powerful}} storms wrenched one of {{the lock}} gates off its <b>fixings.</b> As the water started to drain out, a dam made of sandbags was built. The following day, four-tonne concrete pipes {{were placed in the}} canal basin to dissipate the power of waves coming in from the sea.|$|E
25|$|Carroll Shelby's name is {{associated}} with a chili <b>fixings</b> kit. The kit consists of spices in several packets in a miniature brown paper bag. On the side of the bag is a story related by Shelby about cooking chili during his racing days. On the front of the bag is a depiction of a big western black hat, a trademark piece of clothing for Shelby. He was a founder of the Terlingua International Chili Championship in Terlingua, Texas.|$|E
5000|$|Following the 2015 San Bernardino shooting, {{in which}} {{fourteen}} people were killed, the paper's front page displayed [...] "GOD ISN'T <b>FIXING</b> THIS" [...] along with tweets from Republican politicians offering thoughts and prayers. The paper advocated for tighter gun laws, condemning what it described as [...] "empty platitudes and angry rhetoric" [...] rather than action [...] "in {{response to the}} ongoing plague of gun violence in our country." [...] The provocative headline received both praise and criticism.|$|R

On April 14, Douglass released a video called <b>FIXING</b> YOUR TWITTER BIOS 5, in which he said he was really excited for The Emoji Movie. He referenced The Emoji Movie many times, making a parody of the trailer and selling merchandise of the date of its release, July 28. His videos: Frame-by-frame analysis of The Emoji Movie Trailer, THE EMOJI MOVIE - Trailer #2 and Counting down to The Emoji Movie while spinning 15 fidget spinners and dabbing every 60 seconds have over 4 million views combined.|$|R
5000|$|Macroeconomic {{disadvantages}} included systemic undersupply, {{the pursuit}} of full employment at a steep cost, price <b>fixing’s</b> devastating effect on agricultural incentives, {{and the loss of}} the advantages of money because STP eschews money’s classic role. Systemic undersupply was caused in STP because of the use of [...] "material balances" [...] (plans for the balanced production and consumption of goods and productive inputs), which are theoretically possible, but practically impossible to produce because planners cannot acquire enough information to craft them accurately. Additionally, planners had to aggregate many types of goods and inputs into a single material balance because it was impossible to create an individual balance for each of the approximately 24 million items produced and consumed in the USSR. This system introduced a strong bias towards underproduction, resulting in the great scarcity of consumer goods that plagued the USSR for most of its existence. Another disadvantage is that while STP does allow for the theoretically possibility of full employment, the USSR often achieved full employment by operating enterprises at a loss or leaving workers idle. Therefore, there was always a Pareto superior alternative available to the USSR rather than full employment, specifically, the option to close some enterprises and make transfer payments to the unemployed.|$|R
25|$|The rack {{bars are}} machine {{cut from a}} special quality of steel: the profile is not {{symmetrical}} and the bars must be installed the right way round. Bars tend to fracture between the <b>fixings.</b> When spotted these breaks are marked and then supported with wedges until the bar can be replaced. The pinions consist of an outer ring that is easily replaced. This ring is mounted onto a centre disc, and springs between the two reduce shock loads and allow the small movement needed to accommodate joints and curves. The pinion rings have symmetrical teeth and are turned round to double their working life.|$|E
25|$|Snack Wrap – a wrap {{made with}} white meat chicken breast (crispy or grilled), lettuce, {{shredded}} Cheddar cheese and Monterey Jack cheese, and a sauce (Spicy Buffalo, Ranch, Honey mustard, Chipotle barbecue, or Salsa Roja, the breakfast {{sauce on the}} McSkillet), wrapped in a soft flour tortilla. It was launched on July 1, 2006. Chipotle BBQ is the most recent flavor. Available in the United States, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Brazil. There is also a Mac Snack Wrap which features the <b>fixings</b> of the Big Mac, but without the bun and wrapped in a tortilla shell, and uses one half {{of a piece of}} quarter meat.|$|E
25|$|Maynard {{joined in}} the logging {{activity}} at New York-Alki (later Seattle), {{near the mouth of}} the Duwamish River on Puget Sound. Instead of selling his wood to shippers at $4 a cord, he leased a vessel from Captain Felker, using the wood itself as security, and sold the load in San Francisco at ten times the price. With that money, he bought the <b>fixings</b> for a general store and briefly set up in competition to the only other such store on Puget Sound, which was in Olympia and owned by Catherine's brother. Mike soon agreed to his sister marrying Maynard, apparently on condition that they move the store to Duwamps and do something about that prior marriage.|$|E

25|$|Between 1846 and 1870 {{passenger}} locomotives {{were painted}} hunter green with some having black lining. Frames were red, and wheels were black; buffer beams were the regulation 'signal red'. Goods locomotives were black {{with red and}} white lining, except those operating into Brighton or London Bridge, in passenger livery. Some engines had boilers lagged with wooden strips. These were either highly polished mahogany with brass <b>fixings</b> or were painted in alternating stripes of dark green and vermillion. The main shade of green used gradually became darker. By the time Stroudley became Locomotive Superintendent the colour had become a variant of Brunswick Green used by many other companies. Carriages were painted sea green or varnished wood, the latter mainly first class stock.|$|E
2500|$|Another variant on {{the wedding}} {{scenario}} was on Thanksgiving and Christmas themed shows, where families who were dysfunctional would be gathered on stage around a dinner table, replete with turkey {{and all the}} <b>fixings,</b> and inevitably, the yelling and screaming would degenerate into a full-scale food fight.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} iron crestings of {{this style}} {{are thought to}} have been cast by [...] at the Saracen Foundry, Possilpark, Glasgow. At the architect's request the replicas have been cast in aluminium to reduce the deadweight on the tower structures. To prevent corrosion due to electrolytic action all <b>fixings</b> to the roof structure have been electrically isolated from the aluminium castings with plastic washers etc. Examples of identical original cast iron crestings may be seen adorning Slough railway station, Wrexham General railway station and the HSBC Bank in Derby city centre.|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday 13 October {{experienced}} sailor Lieutenant Commander Peter Eden {{volunteered to}} accompany Crowhurst {{on his last}} leg from Cowes to Teignmouth. Crowhurst {{had fallen into the}} water several times while in Cowes, and as he and Eden climbed aboard Teignmouth Electron, he once again ended up in the water after slipping on the outboard bracket on the stern of the rubber dinghy. Eden's description of his two days with Crowhurst provides the most expert independent assessment available for both boat and sailor {{before the start of the}} race. He recalls that the trimaran sailed immensely swiftly, but could get no closer to the wind than 60 degrees. The speed often reached 12 knots, but the vibrations encountered caused the screws on the Hasler self-steering gear to come loose. Eden said, [...] "We had to keep leaning over the counter to do up the screws. It was a tricky and time consuming business. I told Crowhurst he should get the <b>fixings</b> welded if he wanted it to survive a longer trip!" [...] Eden also commented that the Hasler worked superbly and the boat was [...] "certainly nippy." ...|$|E

60|$|Straying up-stairs, {{during the}} {{preparation}} of the chicken <b>fixings,</b> I happened to pass the doctor's chamber; and as the door stood wide open, and the room was empty, I made bold to peep in.|$|E
6000|$|Hal nodded. [...] "The {{idea came}} to me the very day we left. Saw a window full of tree <b>fixings</b> and on the impulse ran in and got the candles and tinsel. Glad you like it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure!" [...] replied Carnally. [...] "If I can't {{wake you}} any other way, I'll fire your office <b>fixings</b> {{out of the}} window. Guess that will bring the boys around and I'll be glad {{to tell them what}} the trouble's about." ...|$|E
60|$|All these additionals and <b>fixings</b> had, however, {{to be so}} {{constructed}} {{that they}} could be removed, or affixed with some rapidity, for there was always before the sailors the chance that the turnkey might look in to observe how their work was progressing.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm Hallam," [...] {{said the}} other man. [...] "Hallam and Vose, of the Tyee mineral claim. They've been fooling things up yonder, big pump's given out, and I've a few hundred pounds of engine <b>fixings</b> back at the {{railroad}} I want brought in by to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those sawmill {{people want}} their <b>fixings,</b> and if we're {{to hold on}} to their {{contract}} I guess they've got to have them," [...] he said. [...] "She should thrash down to the Inlet by to-morrow night. I figure she'd go along a little easier without her staysail." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the general}} evening {{meal of the}} house was over before the arrival of the boat, Martin, Mark, and Pogram were taking tea and <b>fixings</b> at the public table by themselves, when the {{deputation}} entered to announce this honour; consisting of six gentlemen boarders and a very shrill boy.|$|E
6000|$|... "We won't {{argue about}} it. The dabbin must {{come down and}} when you're ready to move to Bank-end you can tell my {{teamster}} to take your household <b>fixings</b> along. If this doesn't meet the bill, I'll give you a hundred pounds {{and you can go}} where you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy, as it happened, {{came in with}} a teapot in {{his hand}} just then. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I guess I'm {{considerably}} smarter at it than my boss.

6000|$|... "Got your wire," [...] said Wheelock, {{who helped}} himself liberally to the whisky. [...] "We weren't {{through with the}} loading until yesterday, and, though the folks want those sawmill <b>fixings</b> bad, I figured we could wait another twenty-four hours.

6000|$|Wheeler made {{a sign of}} comprehension. [...] "Well," [...] he predicted, [...] "you're {{going to}} see a good many more of that kind before very long." [...] He turned to Nasmyth. [...] "I'm going to stay over to-morrow. The mill's held up again. We had an awkward break, and I can't get the new <b>fixings</b> in. You can tell me how you're getting on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you {{had better}} take a good stock of powder and ball, and you can {{practise}} a bit as you go along. A man ain't any use out on these plains if he cannot shoot. I have got a pony; but you must buy one, and a saddle, and <b>fixings.</b> We will buy another between us to carry our swag. But you need not trouble about the things, I will get all that fixed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{a kind of}} pity we {{lost that}} breeze," [...] he said. [...] "The people up yonder want those sawmill <b>fixings,</b> and with the wind from the east we'd 'most have fetched the Inlet to-night. There was talk of {{somebody}} putting a steamboat on, but the mill's a small one, and they figured they'd give me a show as long as I could keep them going. I've got to do it. There's a living in the contract." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{from under}} her cloak she {{produced}} a small lighted lantern, which the minister had not noticed that she carried at all. The light showed them {{to be close to}} the singing-gallery stairs, under which lay a heap of lumber of all sorts, but consisting mostly of decayed framework, pews, panels, and pieces of flooring, that from time to time had been removed from their original <b>fixings</b> {{in the body of the}} edifice and replaced by new.|$|E
6000|$|The {{storekeeper}} {{glanced at}} a stout deal box. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I guess there's {{not much more}} than twelve pounds in there, and it's for the major--tea and coffee and some special <b>fixings</b> from Vancouver. If he don't get it, he and Miss Coulthurst will come right down to drinking water. The freighter couldn't take more than a half-case of whisky in for him last time, and I guess that's not going to last the Gold Commissioner long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] laughed Thorne, [...] "you will {{no doubt}} be consoled to hear that I've come into line. There are now one hundred and sixty acres of virgin prairie {{recorded}} in my name, and I believe a carload of sawed lumber and general <b>fixings</b> will arrive at the station in the next few days. When they do, I'll borrow your wagon and hired man to haul them out, though I'll have to camp in a tent until I get my first crop in." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{took off}} her hat and shawl, and hung them up. She felt as much at home {{as if she had}} never been away. She had got back to her kingdom, and there was none to dispute it with her. When Dr. Spencer and old Giles Blewett, who had had {{smallpox}} in his youth, came, two hours later, they found Eunice in serene charge. the house was in order and reeking of disinfectants. Victoria's fine furniture and <b>fixings</b> were being bundled out of the parlor. There was no bedroom downstairs, and, if Christopher was going to be ill, he must be installed there.|$|E
6000|$|Graham made {{a little}} grimace. [...] "Well," [...] he said resignedly, [...] "I guess it's human nature, but I'm thankful now and then there's nothing about me but my money that would take the eye of any young woman. I figure they're kind of useful to wake up a man so he'll stir round looking for {{something}} to offer one of them, but he's apt to find his business must go second when she has got it and him, and he has to waste on house <b>fixings</b> what would give a man a fair start in life. Still, it's no use talking. What have you told him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Savine, who {{glanced over}} {{the paper and}} {{scribbled}} across it. Looking up with {{a twinkle in his}} eye, he asked: [...] "Have you been acquiring riches latterly? My cashier will pay that note whenever you hand it in at Vancouver. I'll also endorse your contract for payment if you will give it me. Further, I want to say that I've been to look at your work, and it pleases me.
