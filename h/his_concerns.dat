5|$|Along {{with these}} disappearances, a killer whale carcass bearing large wounds is beached. Police Chief Martin Brody {{believes}} that these events are {{the work of}} a shark. Brody explains <b>his</b> <b>concerns</b> to Mayor Larry Vaughn, who highly doubts that the town has another shark problem. Later, Brody finds debris from the destroyed speedboat in the surf just off the beach. He wades over to retrieve it and uncovers the boat driver's burnt remains.|$|E
5|$|Bush became {{dissatisfied}} with Colonel Marshall's failure {{to get the}} project moving forward expeditiously, specifically the failure to acquire the Tennessee site, the low priority allocated to the project by the Army {{and the location of}} his headquarters in New York City. Bush felt that more aggressive leadership was required, and spoke to Harvey Bundy and Generals Marshall, Somervell, and Styer about <b>his</b> <b>concerns.</b> He wanted the project placed under a senior policy committee, with a prestigious officer, preferably Styer, as overall director.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{followed}} this {{up with an}} address to the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York the next year. Once again, his attack on McCarthyism won approval from many liberals. Asked to send a copy of his views to McCarthy, Hand replied that he had Richard Nixon in mind as well. Despite <b>his</b> <b>concerns</b> about Nixon as vice president, Hand voted for Dwight Eisenhower in the 1952 election, later crediting Eisenhower with bringing about McCarthy's downfall in 1954.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{were made}} to seal off the river with a chain or a boom {{stretching}} between the blockhouse and Tilbury Fort on the other bank, which was eventually accomplished {{at a cost of}} £305. Further work was carried out on the defences, possibly including raising earthworks and establishing watch-houses. Fears of an invasion persisted for many years afterwards and in 1598 Charles Howard, the Lord High Admiral, expressed <b>his</b> <b>concerns</b> about the effectiveness of the Gravesend Blockhouse in protecting the Thames.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{severely limited}} {{his ability to}} play in away matches in European competitions and to travel with the national team. In some cases, he would travel overland by car or train, but the logistics of some matches were such {{that he would not}} travel at all. In the build-up to Arsenal's Champions League match against Lyon in February 2001, Wenger spoke of <b>his</b> <b>concerns</b> for Bergkamp travelling by train and car, because of the exertions involved.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{began in the}} early twentieth century to {{question}} if the Imprimerie nationale Latin-alphabet type was really the work of Garamond, as the Grecs du Roi undoubtedly were. Doubt was raised by French historian Jean Paillard, but he died in the First World War soon after publishing his conclusions in 1914 and his work remained little-read. ATF's historian Henry Lewis Bullen secretly doubted that the 'Garamond' his company was reviving was really Garamond's work, noting that he had never seen it in a sixteenth-century book. He discussed <b>his</b> <b>concerns</b> with ATF junior librarian Beatrice Warde, who would later move to Europe and become a prominent writer on printing advising the British branch of Monotype.|$|E

5|$|A {{party is}} {{held for the}} team, and Dax and Kahn warm to one another's company once more. Afterward, they begin to socialize as they work {{together}} on Kahn's wormhole experiment aboard USS Defiant. They agree to have dinner, but to also bring Bashir along as a chaperone. At the dinner, Bashir feels out of place and is effectively ignored by the two Trills. Returning to the tests, Kahn creates the first artificial wormhole in history and Dax hugs her in celebration. Kahn's brother Bejal (Tim Ryan), {{who is on the}} science team, speaks to her separately and highlights <b>his</b> <b>concerns</b> regarding her contact with Dax. Despite this, Kahn goes to Dax's quarters and a discussion between the two leads to a kiss; Kahn leaves before it goes any further.|$|E
5|$|Bennett {{remained}} {{active in}} the military, continuing to serve {{as part of the}} Militia, which was reorganised in 1921 following the conclusion of the demobilisation process. From then until 1926, he served as commander of the 9th Infantry Brigade, before being appointed to command the 2nd Division. In 1930, he was promoted to the rank of major general and over the ensuing years became increasingly parochial against the small permanent Staff Corps. He was transferred to the unattached list in 1932. In 1937, amidst increasing tensions in Europe, he came into conflict with the Military Board after he wrote a number of newspaper articles expressing <b>his</b> <b>concerns</b> about complacent defence policy and the efficiency of regular officers.|$|E
5|$|Going {{against the}} normal {{convention}} that the strongest characters {{should be the}} largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of Dragon Balls most powerful characters, including Goku, with small statures. Toriyama explained that he had Goku grow up so that drawing fight scenes would be easier, even though Torishima was against it initially because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically. Torishima later referred to this as his own biggest crisis during the series, with Toriyama threatening to end it if Goku could not grow up. The editor said <b>his</b> <b>concerns</b> were unfounded, as readers accepted the change without complaint.|$|E

5|$|Moreover, Wang was {{privy to}} details of Neil Heywood's death, and had {{reportedly}} attempted to voice <b>his</b> <b>concerns</b> to Bo about alleged poisoning. Around 16 January, Wang {{is believed to}} have confronted Bo over evidence that implicated Bo's wife in the murder. Although Bo initially agreed to allow an inquiry, he then changed course and sought to obstruct investigations. Wang was abruptly demoted on 2 February to the far less prestigious position of Vice-mayor overseeing education, science, and environmental affairs. Bo placed Wang under surveillance, and several of his close associates were reportedly taken into custody. Some reports allege that Bo may have been plotting to have Wang assassinated.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding Godley's {{efforts to}} placate him, Allen again raised <b>his</b> <b>concerns</b> over {{the extent of}} New Zealand's {{contributions}} to the war relative to Australia's and sought further explanation for the New Zealand losses of 12 October. Allen was also beginning to query the quality of British generalship. Godley raised {{the prospect of being}} replaced as commander of the NZEF, and proposed Major General Andrew Hamilton Russell, the commander of the New Zealand Division, as his successor. This never eventuated and Godley remained the commander of the NZEF until its disbandment in late 1919.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} to Martlesham, Dowding {{outlined}} <b>his</b> <b>concerns</b> about night interceptions and {{the characteristics of a}} proper night fighter. Since the interceptions were long affairs, the aircraft needed to have long endurance. To ensure that friendly fire was not an issue, pilots would be required to identify all targets visually. This meant a separate radar operator would be needed, so the pilot would not lose his night vision by looking at the CRTs. And finally, since the time needed to arrange an interception was so long, the aircraft required armament that could guarantee destruction of a bomber in a single pass—there was little chance a second interception could be arranged.|$|E

5|$|The Historia Ecclesiastica {{has given}} Bede a high reputation, but <b>his</b> <b>concerns</b> were {{different}} from those of a modern writer of history. His focus {{on the history of the}} organisation of the English church, and on heresies and the efforts made to root them out, led him to exclude the secular history of kings and kingdoms except where a moral lesson could be drawn or where they illuminated events in the church. Besides the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the medieval writers William of Malmesbury, Henry of Huntingdon, and Geoffrey of Monmouth used his works as sources and inspirations. Early modern writers, such as Polydore Vergil and Matthew Parker, the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury, also utilised the Historia, and his works were used by both Protestant and Catholic sides in the Wars of Religion.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of the PT boat force in the Southwest Pacific, Commander Morton C. Mumma, opposed building extensive PT boat facilities at Arawe as he had sufficient bases and Japanese barges normally sailed along the north coast of New Britain. Mumma took <b>his</b> <b>concerns</b> to Carpender and Barbey, who eventually agreed {{that he would not}} be required to establish a base there if he thought it unnecessary. Instead, he assigned six boats stationed at Dreger Harbor in New Guinea and Kiriwina Island to operate along the south coast of New Britain east of Arawe each night, and asked only for emergency refuelling facilities at Arawe.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} set on the fiftieth {{birthday}} of Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), {{and much of the}} plot revolves around <b>his</b> <b>concerns</b> with his age and desire to reclaim the happiness of his childhood. At the same time, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is forced to deal with her ex-boyfriend Dennis Duffy (Winters) and his self-diagnosis as a sex addict as well as the fact that Dennis slept with her close friend Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski). A final plotline in the episode involves the desire of Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) to travel in space, and the efforts by Liz and Jack to deceive him into thinking he has done so.|$|E

5|$|The {{men at the}} Plum River {{settlement}} waited {{overnight and}} then fled to Galena where they reported the incident to Colonel James M. Strode. He ordered a militia party to the settlement to secure the it {{and make sure the}} attackers were dealt with accordingly. When the detachment arrived at Savanna they found no Native Americans, and plenty of bullet holes from the battle. The group continued to Fort Armstrong, where they picked up supplies, and returned to Galena without incident. On June 1, then-Colonel Zachary Taylor expressed <b>his</b> <b>concerns</b> about recent events, including the Plum River raid in a letter to General Henry Atkinson. He stated that there had no doubt been an attack at the settlement, but no one was killed and the site abandoned since.|$|E
5|$|When the {{restoration}} of the Sistine Chapel was announced, it sparked a barrage of queries and objections from art historians around the world. One of the most vocal of these critics was James Beck, of ArtWatch International, who issued repeated warnings about the possibility of damage to Michelangelo's work from over-strenuous restoration. An argument that was used repeatedly was that all the previous interventions had caused damage of one sort or another. Any restoration, as opposed to conservation, puts an artwork at risk. Conservation, on the other hand, aids in the preservation of the work in its present state and in prevention of further deterioration. Beck has written about <b>his</b> <b>concerns</b> in Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal.|$|E
5|$|While {{he reads}} the diary {{over the course of}} several months, Jake is confronted by his {{siblings}} about his own view of humans. He spends time with his sister’s human fiancée and visits the set of a film in which his brother stars. Jake is introduced to a human actress whom he finds attractive. As he reaches the end of his father’s diary, there is an entry detailing a time Jake was attacked by some human boys as a child. Jake, who had repressed the memory, discusses it with his mother. He learns the attack was stopped by members of ‘’Gallus Rex’’, an anti-human chicken group. Their actions colored Jake’s perception, and Elmer recorded <b>his</b> <b>concerns</b> about their effect on Jake in his diary.|$|E
