25|$|Dresser Bridge The current {{bridge is}} a four-span structure, which {{features}} two early U.S. examples of riveted Warren through truss structures. The current superstructure was manufactured in 1906 by the American Bridge Company {{to replace the}} second wood truss at this location, which had been constructed in 1893. The original bridge at this location was completed in 1866 and consisted of two wooden Howe trusses. The original coursed-ashlar sandstone piers from 1865-66 are still in use and have been supplemented by concrete piers from 1893 and 1906. The bridge consists of two 125ft. through Warren trusses and two 60ft. <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> girder spans with one {{at each end of}} the bridge. The abutments and piers are angled parallel to the course of the river below and are not perpendicular to the railroad’s alignment. As a result, the bridge spans are laterally offset from one another.|$|E

2500|$|Farwell Bridge This bridge {{consists}} of the primary 196ft. Pratt through pin-connected truss manufactured by Edge Moor Bridge Works in 1896, a 98ft. Warren through pin-connected pony truss, three 30ft <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> spans from 1907, and a 70’ <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> girder span from 1932. The original bridge at this location was also a single-span covered wooden Howe truss similar to the spans at Dresser. Stonework {{for two of the}} bridge’s piers dates to the original construction in 1865-66 while later concrete piers and abutments were added in 1896, 1907, and 1932. [...] Caltrans encased the original eastern pier in steel and concrete in the 2000s to protect the highway below {{in the event of an}} earthquake. As at Dresser, the piers are at an angle to the bridge, and the spans are offset as a result.|$|E

30|$|T-shaped <b>deck</b> <b>plates</b> {{were used}} in this study to anchor the void formers, to prevent {{detachment}} from the designed locations, which is generally caused by buoyancy. In addition, the <b>deck</b> <b>plates</b> not only serve as a concrete framework, but also operate {{as a part of the}} structural member, imparting additional structural strength, thereby enhancing the structural stability of the entire building. Figure  1 a shows a cross-sectional view of the voided slab system used in this field test.|$|R

50|$|The bridge carries Highway 6 (formerly Highway 68) {{across a}} narrow channel {{separating}} Manitoulin Island from the much smaller Goat Island, forming the only land access. It {{consists of two}} 21 m (70 ft) <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> girder approaches on the north end (Goat Island) and a single 18 m (60 ft) <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> girder approach on the south end (Manitoulin Island), with a 112 m (368 ft) through swing bridge span. The swing bridge sits 5.3 m (17.5 ft) above mean water level, and provides a 48 m (160 ft) opening {{on either side of}} the central pier for water passage.|$|E
5000|$|Notable bridges are a three-span Warren deck {{truss bridge}} over the Thornapple River, the 1887 [...] "High Bridge" [...] trestle over the Grand River at Grand Ledge, and a <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> girder {{bridge over the}} Red Cedar River and Lansing's River Trail.|$|E

50|$|Later {{improvements}} {{included an}} additional 50 tons of <b>deck</b> <b>plating</b> over the magazines and machinery spaces {{as well as}} rings fitted around the turret and pilot houses.|$|R
50|$|With the MSC Napoli {{remaining}} {{in one piece}} a first controlled explosion blew holes in the <b>deck</b> <b>plating</b> in order to expose the structural beams below using shaped charges with a second cutting punch charge timed 50 milliseconds later than the first. That job successfully exposed the beams, so more charges were planted across the beams which were ultimately severed. With only her <b>deck</b> <b>plates</b> on the main deck holding the vessel together around the bridge structure of the vessel, two tugs {{at either end of}} the ship tried to pull the ship apart.|$|R
5000|$|Construction of the Willamette River bridge {{began in}} August 1906. [...] Its swing-span section {{was the longest}} in the world, with a length of 521 ft or 524 ft.

50|$|On 24 August 1902, a 30 ft {{length of}} parapet {{collapsed}} into the river, and {{a section of}} <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> weighing around 5 cwt fell from the bridge in July 1903. The opening of a toll-free concrete bridge in 1909 caused concern among the trustees, but it continued {{to be used by}} vehicles and pedestrians.|$|E

50|$|Prince David was {{suffering}} from neglect, with a badly fouled hull, rotten deck planks and bulkheads rusted thin. Holes in the <b>deck</b> <b>plating,</b> crystallized valves and decrepit auxiliary engines augured an expensive refit as well as conversion.|$|R
50|$|The new {{railroad}} bridge towers over Magnolia at a 50 ft elevation. The bridge has six 100 ft, three 80 ft, and two 75 ft <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> girder spans. At {{a length}} of about 1000 ft long with 10 reinforced concrete piers, this is the smaller of the two bridges built for the Magnolia Cutoff.|$|E
5000|$|The {{newly built}} spans were through plate girder spans {{of the same}} length as the old spans. These were {{designed}} for Cooper E90 loading with diesel impact. The floor system of the bridge consisted of rolled sections installed transverse to the main girders, with a steel <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> installed {{on top of the}} floor beams.|$|E
50|$|The bridge crosses {{over the}} Columbia River and {{was built on}} {{concrete}} piers 85 ft above the water to provide clearance for any river traffic. The spans include 14 Warren deck trusses, one Parker through truss, and <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> girders on the approaches. When the railroad electrified in the 1920s, supports for the catenary {{were added to the}} bridge.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to provide informa-tion regarding the distribution of transverse bending and shear stresses in a main transverse bulkhead of a catamaran cross-structure. Additionally, data is to be obtained on the width of <b>deck</b> <b>plating</b> between main bulkheads that resists transverse bending. The particular cross-structure configura-tion to be investigated is patterned after the United States Navy ASR- 21 Class catamaran. This study is of a two-dimensional nature to eliminate {{the influence of the}} adjacent transverse bulkheads on the stress distribution. In this configuration, the cross-structure bulkhead with its associated "effective breadth " of top and bottom <b>deck</b> <b>plating</b> resembles a large plate girder. The principle parameters varied are the breadth to dept...|$|R
50|$|Coaming is any {{vertical}} {{surface on}} a ship designed to deflect or prevent entry of water. It usually refers to a raised section of <b>deck</b> <b>plating</b> around an opening, such as a hatch. Coamings also provide a frame onto which to fit a hatch cover.|$|R
5|$|By Day 20 {{the forward}} {{part of the}} bow was in {{position}} and the hull plating was well underway. By Day 55 all of the upper deck beams were in place and by Day 83 the upper <b>deck</b> <b>plates</b> were in position. By Day 125 (4 February) the hull was finished.|$|R
50|$|An {{orthotropic}} bridge or orthotropic deck is {{one whose}} deck typically comprises a structural steel <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> stiffened either longitudinally or transversely, or in both directions. This allows the deck both to directly bear vehicular loads and {{to contribute to}} the bridge structure's overall load-bearing behaviour. The orthotropic deck may be integral with or supported on a grid of deck framing members such as floor beams and girders.|$|E
50|$|During the Phantom FG1 trials (involving three newly {{delivered}} aircraft {{operated by}} 700P NAS) the longer waist catapult was used, {{and a thick}} steel plate was chained to the deck behind the catapult to absorb {{the heat of the}} Phantom's afterburners. The JBD was not used as it would have been damaged, and after each launch fire hoses sprayed water on the <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> to cool it down before the next aircraft could be loaded onto the catapult.|$|E
50|$|A classic wreck scene photo, circa 1860, {{shows the}} Wharf Branch bridge {{collapsed}} into Wills Creek, with the locomotive C. E. Detmold dangling into the creek. This image indicates the branch and the facility were in use {{at least to}} this date. The original Potomac Wharf Branch bridge was a 203 ft <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> girder structure, with two support pillars in the creek. Built in 1849, and rebuilt after the Detmold accident, it survived until the flood of 1936.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is a {{comparison}} between two widely used non-linear models for the prediction of corrosion wastage on <b>deck</b> <b>plates</b> and stiffeners of oil tankers. Analysis of data is based on real corrosion thickness measurements of ship hull structural elements performed by the Croatian Register of Shipping (CRS), gauged on periodic dry-docking and close-up surveys of three oil tankers in service after 10, 15 and 20 years. The two non-linear corrosion models are fitted to the real corrosion thickness measurements of <b>deck</b> <b>plates</b> and longitudinals in ballast and cargo tanks after 10 and 15 years in order to predict the corrosion loss in the 20 th year. The uncertainty of corrosion propagation is then determined by the statistical analysis {{of the differences between}} the predicted and the measured corrosion thickness in the 20 th year...|$|R
5000|$|In {{defense of}} fortifications, siege and {{garrison}} mortars could harass work parties constructing siege batteries and trenches.

50|$|The Type 4's battery {{was located}} under the driver's seat (passenger seat on RHD models). All models {{featured}} ventless driver and front passenger windows, notched on their leading edge to provide draught-free ventilation, no cost metallic paint, radial ply tires, full carpeting, clock, electric rear window demister, flow-through ventilation, undercoating, and a thermostatically controlled auxiliary heating system, specifically, a gasoline-operated heater model BA4 by Eberspächer, fired by a glow plug accessible from a hidden rear window <b>deck</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|OMEG built a [...] {{narrow gauge}} railway {{extending}} 567 km from Swakopmund on the Atlantic coast to the mines of Tsumeb. Construction began in 1903 and reached Tsumeb three years later. The first 225 km of railway required 110 steel bridges to cross deeply eroded gullies through sparsely vegetated arid terrain. Most were <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> girders. The railway, {{known as the}} Otavibahn, was the longest [...] gauge railway {{in the world at}} its time of construction.|$|E
50|$|The M18's {{new design}} {{incorporated}} several labor saving and innovative maintenance features. The Wright R975 engine was fully unitized, {{as it was}} mounted on rails equipped with steel rollers that allowed maintenance crews to disconnect it easily from the transmission, roll it out onto the lowered engine rear cover using rails, service it, and then reconnect it to the transmission. The transmission could also be removed easily and rolled out onto a front <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> to facilitate quick inspection and repairs.|$|E
2500|$|The cruiser {{was armed}} with eight single QF [...] guns, eight single QF 3-pounder guns, two 4.7-inch guns, two field guns, three Maxim machine guns, and two [...] torpedo tubes sited above the waterline. Armour {{protection}} {{was limited to}} [...] thick section of <b>deck</b> <b>plating</b> over vital areas. The ship's company initially stood at 220, but this was later reduced to 188; 12 officers, and 176 sailors.|$|R

Furious resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939.|$|R
50|$|But Coast Guard investigations, and {{independent}} examinations of the wreck, told a different story: the Marine Electric left port in an un-seaworthy condition, with gaping holes in its <b>deck</b> <b>plating</b> and hatch covers. The hatch covers, in particular, posed a problem, since without them the cargo hold could fill with {{water in the}} storm and drag the ship under. And {{it was there that}} the investigation took a second, dramatic turn.|$|R
