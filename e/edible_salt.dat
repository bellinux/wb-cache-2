5|$|Salt is {{processed}} from salt mines, {{and by the}} evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine; salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp and many other products. Of the annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of salt, only about 6% is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. <b>Edible</b> <b>salt</b> is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} {{the concentration of}} some trace elements such as Pb, Cd, Zn, Fe, Cu and Al in <b>edible</b> <b>salts</b> were determined. The study was carried out on 60 samples of kitchen salts and table salts (a fine-ground, refined and crystallized rock salt with nearly pure 95 % or greater sodium chloride). The packed salt samples were collected from retail market in Tehran City and analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry for Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd), Zinc (Zn), Iron (Fe), Copper (Cu) and Aluminum (Al). The {{mean and standard deviation}} of Pb, Cd, Zn, Fe, Cu and Al in kitchen salts were 1. 59 ± 0. 90, 0. 91 ± 0. 32, 6. 02 ± 2. 54, 17. 8 ± 6. 11, 1. 24 ± 0. 90 and 5. 82 ± 0. 61 mg kg - 1, respectively.

50|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} is {{a recognized}} {{problem in the}} western, southern, and eastern regions of the country, which historically did not derive their salt from ocean water. China Salt {{is responsible for the}} iodization of <b>edible</b> table <b>salt</b> in China, where legal salt producers manufacture iodized salt in accordance with the requirements of China Salt. Since the monopoly is the sole provider of iodized salt, consumers have no choice over how much iodine they consume, which has led to health problems relating to iodine overdose; there have been noted increases in reported cases of thyroid cancer in China during 2013. As of 2014, table salt on the Chinese market contains approximately 20-50 mg of iodine per kilogram.|$|R

50|$|Nutrient {{content of}} {{mayonnaise}} (> 50% <b>edible</b> oil, 9-11% <b>salt,</b> 7-10% {{sugar in the}} aqueous phase) is suitable as food source for many spoilage organisms, the set of condition such as (low pH of 3.6 to 4.0, low water activity aw of 0.925) restricts the growth of yeasts, a few bacteria and molds. Yeasts of the genus Saccharomyces (Lactobacillus fructivorans and Z. bailii) are the species that responsible for the spoilage mayonnaise. The characteristics of spoilage caused by Z.bailli are product separation and a “yeasty” odor. A study suggests that adding encapsulated cells of Bifidobacterium bifidum and B. infantis prolongs the life of mayonnaise up to 12 weeks without microorganism spoilage.|$|R

50|$|Sodium {{chloride}} , {{also known}} as salt or halite, is an ionic compound with the chemical formula NaCl, representing a 1:1 ratio of sodium and chloride ions. With molar masses of 22.99 and 35.45 g·mol−1, respectively, 100 g of NaCl contain 39.34 g Na and 60.66 g Cl. Sodium chloride is the salt most responsible for the salinity of seawater and of the extracellular fluid of many multicellular organisms. In the form of <b>edible</b> or table <b>salt</b> {{it is commonly used}} as a condiment and food preservative. Large quantities of sodium chloride are used in many industrial processes, and it is a major source of sodium and chlorine compounds used as feedstocks for further chemical syntheses. A second major application of sodium chloride is de-icing of roadways in sub-freezing weather.|$|R
40|$|The {{important}} glycoalkaloids in {{potatoes are}} α-solanine and α-chaconine. Their natural function is probably {{to serve as}} stress metabolites or phytoalexins {{for the protection of}} the potato when attacked by insects, fungi, etc. They contribute flavour to potatoes but at higher concentrations cause bitterness and are toxic to humans. α-Solanine and α-chaconine appear to have two main toxic actions, one on cell membranes and another one on acetylcholinesterase. Symptoms of α-solanine/α-chaconine poisoning involve an acute gastrointestinal upset with diarrhea, vomiting and severe abdominal pain. An instrumental high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) method was applied for the quantification of α-solanine and α-chaconine in peeled potato skin, raw potato pulp and cooked peeled potato tubers. The limit of quantification (LOQ) for α-solanine and α-chaconine was found to be 5. 0 mg kg− 1 for each glycoalkaloid. In this study the factors of potential loss of α-solanine and α-chaconine in potato tubers during peeling (factor= 0. 8) and cooking into <b>edible</b> stage in <b>salted</b> water (factor= 0. 8) were examined. The combined loss factor of peeling and cooking for sum of both glycoalkaloids in potato tubers was 0. 64. These factors were practically used for the probabilistic exposure assessment of the intake of potato glycoalkaloids in the Czech Republic. ...|$|R
5000|$|All {{household}} {{members in}} 1991 and subsequent surveys provided individual data on dietary intake, body composition, blood pressure, health history, and health-related behaviors (e.g., smoking, beverage consumption, medication, key chronic diseases). These data include dietary intake for 3 consecutive days {{as well as}} detailed physical examinations that include blood pressure (for adults), clinical measures of health, weight, height, and arm and head circumference (and also waist-hip ratios beginning in 1993). The 3 consecutive days during which detailed household food consumption data were collected were randomly allocated from Monday to Sunday and are almost equally balanced across the 7 {{days of the week}} for each sampling unit. Household food consumption was determined by examining changes in inventory from the beginning to the end of each day, in combination with a weighing and measurement technique. Chinese balances with a maximum limit of 15 kilograms and a minimum of 20 grams were used. All processed foods (including <b>edible</b> oils and <b>salt)</b> remaining after the last meal before initiation of the survey were weighed and recorded. All purchases, home production, and processed snack foods were recorded. Whenever foods were brought into the household unit, they were weighed and preparation waste (e.g., spoiled rice, discarded cooked meals fed to pets or animals) was estimated when weighing was not possible. At the end of the survey, all remaining foods were again weighed and recorded. The number of household members and visitors were recorded at each meal.|$|R
50|$|Kazakhstan, {{a country}} in Central Eurasia in which local food {{supplies}} seldom contain sufficient iodine, has drastically reduced iodine deficiency through salt iodisation programmes. Campaigns {{by the government and}} non-profit organisations to educate the public about the benefits of iodised salt began in the mid 1990s, with iodisation of <b>edible</b> <b>salt</b> becoming legally mandatory in 2002.|$|E
50|$|<b>Edible</b> <b>salt</b> can be iodised by {{spraying}} {{it with a}} {{potassium iodate}} or potassium iodide solution. 57 grams of potassium iodate, costing about US$1.15 (in 2006), is required to iodise a ton of salt. Dextrose is added as a stabilizer to prevent potassium iodide from oxidizing and evaporating. Anti-caking agents such as calcium silicate are commonly added to table salt to prevent clumping.|$|E
5000|$|Korean {{sea salt}} or Korean brining salt, called wang-sogeum ( [...] ; [...] "king/queen salt") or gulgeun-sogeum ( [...] ; [...] "coarse salt") in Korean, is {{a variety of}} <b>edible</b> <b>salt</b> with a larger grain size and lower sodium content {{compared}} to common kosher salt. It is used mainly for salting napa cabbages when making kimchi. Being minimally processed, it serves to help developing flavours in fermented foods.|$|E
40|$|A {{spatially}} representative statewide {{survey was}} conducted in Rajasthan, India to assess household coverage of atta wheat flour, <b>edible</b> oil, and <b>salt.</b> An even distribution of primary sampling units were selected based on their proximity to centroids on a hexagonal grid laid over the survey area. A sample of n = 18 households from each of m = 252 primary sampling units PSUs was taken. Demographic data on all members of these households were collected, and a broader dataset was collected about a single caregiver and {{a child in the}} first 2 years of life. Data were collected on demographic and socioeconomic status; education; housing conditions; recent infant and child mortality; water, sanitation, and hygiene practices; food security; child health; infant and young child feeding practices; maternal dietary diversity; coverage of fortified staples; and maternal and child anthropometry. Data were collected from 4, 627 households and the same number of caregiver/child pairs. Atta wheat flour was widely consumed across the state (83 %); however, only about 7 % of the atta wheat flour was classified as fortifiable, and only about 6 % was actually fortified (mostly inadequately). For oil, almost 90 % of edible oil consumed by households in the survey was classified as fortifiable, but only about 24 % was fortified. For salt, coverage was high, with almost 85 % of households using fortified salt and 66 % of households using adequately fortified salt. Iodized salt coverage was also high; however, rural and poor population groups {{were less likely to be}} reached by the intervention. Voluntary fortification of atta wheat flour and edible oil lacked sufficient industry consolidation to cover significant portions of the population. It is crucial that appropriate delivery channels are utilized to effectively deliver essential micronutrients to at-risk population groups. Government distribution systems are likely the best means to accomplish this goal...|$|R

50|$|Salting is the {{preservation}} of food with dry <b>edible</b> <b>salt.</b> It is related to pickling in general and more specifically to brining (preparing food with brine, that is, salty water) and is one form of curing. It {{is one of the}} oldest methods of preserving food, and two historically significant salt-cured foods are salted fish (usually dried and salted cod or salted herring) and salt-cured meat (such as bacon). Vegetables such as runner beans and cabbage are also often preserved in this manner.|$|E
50|$|Salt {{and pepper}} {{is the common}} name for <b>edible</b> <b>salt</b> and black pepper, a {{traditionally}} paired set of condiments found on dining tables where European-style food is eaten. The pairing of salt and pepper as table condiments dates to seventeenth-century French cuisine, which considered pepper the only spice (as distinct from herbs such as fines herbes) which did not overpower the true taste of food. They are typically found {{in a set of}} salt and pepper shakers, often a matched set; however, salt and pepper are typically maintained in separate shakers.|$|E

50|$|Salting is the {{preservation}} of food with dry <b>edible</b> <b>salt.</b> It is related to pickling (preparing food with brine, i.e. salty water), {{and is one of}} the oldest methods of preserving food. Salt inhibits the growth of microorganisms by drawing water out of microbial cells through osmosis. Concentrations of salt up to 20% are required to kill most species of unwanted bacteria. Smoking, often used in the process of curing meat, adds chemicals to the surface of meat that reduce the concentration of salt required. Salting is used because most bacteria, fungi and other potentially pathogenic organisms cannot survive in a highly salty environment, due to the hypertonic nature of salt. Any living cell in such an environment will become dehydrated through osmosis and die or become temporarily inactivated.|$|E
50|$|On 8 March 2013, Taobao {{was forced}} to remove all listings of salt from its online marketplace, since it {{violated}} the law forbidding sale of salt across regions. Private businesses that violate salt regulations are fined and have their salt products seized. One such case occurred in Chongqing in 2013, where 90 tons of illegally manufactured industrial salt intended for sale as <b>edible</b> <b>salt</b> in Hubei, Sichuan, Shanxi, Shandong and Henan was confiscated by authorities, with a total street market value of 4 million yuan. Because China Salt controls the country's salt mines and wet salt farms whilst selling at expensive prices, various companies manufacturing food products such as soy sauce and food seasonings have resorted to the illegal use of industrial salt created by artificial manufacture in efforts to reduce costs, {{at the risk of}} being caught and fined.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{fertilizers}} use salts {{in appropriate}} quantities. Gundry and others note that salt {{was a minor}} but essential ingredient in fertilizer, and Gundry suggests that [...] "earth" [...] (τῆς γῆς, tēs gēs), should be translated as soil, and the disciples are thus to help the world grow and prosper. Many scholars disagree with Gundry's translation of earth as soil: most see it as referring {{to the world and}} in Schweizer's words [...] "the totality of mankind," [...] even though the more common word used for this purpose is anthrópos and that gé is used extensively as [...] "land" [...] or as physical earth. George Shillington feels that the Greek word for salt here refers to the chemical agent used in ancient times to fertilize fields rather than the <b>edible</b> <b>salt</b> used to preserve meat or flavor foods, indicating that the disciples are to bring new life to the world. Alan Kreider expounds upon this idea and notes various sources which led him to share this interpretation. Willard Swartley states that by obeying the Golden Rule one becomes the fertilizing salt of the earth. Phil Schmidt also believes that the disciples are meant to stimulate growth and positively affect the world.|$|E
