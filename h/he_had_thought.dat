5|$|Vinokourov led the Astana squad at the Tour de France. Entering 2011, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> {{it to be}} {{his final}} season as an active competitor, and his main goal for the year was to wear the yellow jersey at some time during the Tour. His pursuit of yellow was {{strengthened}} {{by the addition of}} Kreuziger to the squad, riding solely in support of the veteran Kazakh. Paris–Nice stage winner Di Gregorio and Tiralongo were also named to the squad.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{believed}} he had been betrayed by many <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> would support him, but carried on regardless {{in support of his}} party's nominee. Hancock (who remained on active duty) and the Republican nominee, James A. Garfield, did not campaign directly, in keeping with the customs of that time, but campaigns were conducted by other party members, including Randall. Speaking in Pennsylvania and around the Midwest, Randall did his best to rally the people to Hancock against Garfield, but without success. Garfield was elected with 214 electoral votes—including those of Pennsylvania. Worse still for Randall, Garfield's victory had swept the Republicans back into a majority in the House, meaning Randall's time as Speaker was at an end.|$|E
5|$|A February 2000 {{story about}} organic {{vegetables}} on 20/20 included statements by Stossel that tests {{had shown that}} neither organic nor conventional produce samples contained any pesticide residue, and that organic food {{was more likely to}} be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. The Environmental Working Group objected to his report, mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to determine that the produce had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's statement that the test results had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, unchanged, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in The New York Times confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, saying that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that the gist of his report had been accurate.|$|E

5|$|Braham and Walsh {{scrambled}} {{free of the}} Mosquito and {{hid behind}} a sand dune. As they did so the aircraft's fuel tanks exploded. The Fw 190 pilot flew over at 20 feet {{and for a moment}} they believed he was going to fire upon them. To their relief he waved and flew by. They contemplated escape but instantly German soldiers were running towards them. They had crash-landed near to a radar station and the enemy soldiers were at the crash site very quickly. The Germans fired a few shots in their direction but none hit them. They were captured and searched. The Germans found a Mauser pistol which Braham had taken from a crashed German bomber. It was not well received by his captors. Braham believed they might attack him and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> about grabbing the gun, fighting it out with the German guards, finding a friendly Dane and making it to Sweden somehow. The tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and offered some synthetic German coffee. Soon a pair of Luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near Esjberg.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{positions}} were well-sited {{on the spur}} for an attack from the east along the track from Katika to Sattelberg, but at this point, Captain B. G. Cribb, the commander of D Company, 2/13th Infantry Battalion, came {{on the radio and}} announced that he was in contact with the Japanese to the west, and was going to attack from that direction. A furious fight ensured. The Japanese held their fire until the Australians were almost on top of them. Realising that the position was stronger than <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought,</b> Cribb withdrew after suffering eight dead and twenty wounded. Windeyer ordered the 2/17th to bypass the position and proceed to its objective, the high ground south of the Song River. The 2/15th was ordered to attack Katika Spur. The attack was delivered at 15:15 after a preliminary bombardment by 3 inch mortars, but the Japanese defenders had withdrawn, leaving behind eight dead. By nightfall, most of the brigade was on their objectives.|$|E
5|$|Izumi {{suggests}} {{that in the first}} six days, Makoto had been deceived by her and Okuhiko, but rather than believing in premonitions had believed he had traveled back in time. When Izumi died on April 6, and Makoto had desired to travel back in time, Curé Syndrome manifested. She {{suggests that}} while <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> that he was traveling back in time, he had only imagined a different past where events played out differently, as part of a delusion, and that he had given himself partial memories in the form of premonitions in each loop; in the last loop, he would have given himself all his memories, other than the knowledge that he is experiencing a delusion. She says that once Makoto succeeds in saving her, he will break out of the delusion, and the six days in his delusion will become reality. Makoto refuses to believe her, claiming that everything around him is reality, but starts to doubt throughout the week. Depending on the player's choices, the route branches into two endings. In one, the delusions appear to be changing reality, but are revealed to be a chain of coincidences. In the other, the delusions do change reality, and Makoto wakes up {{at the bottom of the}} cliff he fell down at the end of the last loop, badly wounded from having protected Izumi during the fall. It is left ambiguous as to what is real and what is a delusion, and whether Makoto has escaped to reality or still is trapped in his delusion.|$|E

25|$|The species T. acutirostris was {{initially}} named by Richard Owen in 1840. This holotype (BMNH 14553) {{was from the}} Alum Shale Formation of Lower Toarcian in Whitby, Yorkshire, England. Michael Maisch, in 2000, described it as belonging in the genus Temnodontosaurus. However, in 2010 Maisch published a paper stating that the specimen didn’t belong in Temnodontosaurus, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> previously, and probably belonged in Ichthyosaurus instead.|$|E
25|$|DeWyze, who had {{released}} {{two independent}} albums before winning the ninth season of American Idol, made his major-label debut with Live It Up in 2010.

Spain discovered the island on 5 December 1492 {{during the first}} voyage of Christopher Columbus across the Atlantic. When Columbus initially landed in Haiti, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> he had found India or Asia. On Christmas Day 1492, Columbus' flagship the Santa Maria ran aground north {{of what is now}} Limonade. As a consequence, Columbus ordered his men to salvage what they could from the ship, and he created the first European settlement in the Americas, naming it La Navidad after the day the ship was destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Hayes {{worked on}} the {{building}} from 1956 to 1970 and {{was responsible for the}} creation of the iconic 'BBC Television Centre' lettering on the façade of Studio 1. The lettering was later used all over the building, even in tile work outside lift entrances. Demands from Broadcasting House meant that Hayes had less time than <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> to design a decor for the façade, leading to him puncturing a scale foam model of the wall with drawing pins, and thus the birth of the iconic 'Atomic Dots': there are 26 across the façade of Studio 1, each one backlit and clearly visible at night.|$|E
25|$|By {{the third}} day of his capture, Bryson had earned {{sufficient}} trust from Berdella to persuade him to establish a regime of tying his hands in front of him after his sexual abuse rather than above his head and to the bed upon the excuse that his (Berdella's) doing so was restricting the circulation to his arms; he had also persuaded Berdella to leave a television on within the room, with the remote control placed between his legs whenever Berdella was out of the room. However, he would later state to investigators that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> almost constantly about escaping. The following day, he managed to break free of his restraints by burning through them using a book of matches Berdella had inadvertently left in the room and within his reach when he had left the house to go to his place of work.|$|E

His frustration is then explained to be bigger than that: his best friend was murdered just a day before. He also explains that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>thoughts</b> about robbing a bank to {{have enough money to}} feed his newborn baby. Later, {{at the end of the}} song, his car is robbed and he expresses an ever-bigger disappointment at the government. According to Allmusic reviewer Marisa Brown, Ludacris' character in the song <b>has</b> these <b>thoughts</b> because <b>he</b> is suffering from depression.|$|R
25|$|Modern historians {{tend to take}} {{a kinder}} view of Churchill’s actions at Antwerp. He had asked for the brigades minus recruits, {{and it had been}} Kitchener who insisted on {{retaining}} territorials in the UK to defend the East Coast against possible German invasion. Only 57 men were actually killed. In “The World Crisis” Churchill claimed he had prolonged Belgian surrender by a few days and occupied five German divisions. In fact it had been a week and enabled Calais and Dunkirk to be secured. Rhodes James believes that Antwerp was “substantially to Churchill’s credit”. However, at the time <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> that holding Antwerp would help the Allied advance north; the claim that it helped hold Calais and Dunkirk when the German advance resumed is hindsight. The more damaging attack, made inside and outside the Cabinet, was that Churchill was seeking publicity instead of running his department.|$|E
25|$|Nicholas' {{determination}} {{to defend his}} sister's honor leads his uncle to vow he will destroy the young man. What ensues {{is a series of}} adventures in which the upstanding Nicholas manages to survive the schemes of his evil uncle, including an attempt to return Smike to Squeers by kidnapping him and an effort to abort Nicholas' growing relationship with Madeline by promising her father he will excuse his debts if the girl weds Hawk. Ralph's designs on Madeline are thwarted when her father dies unexpectedly. Unfortunately, Smike falls ill and soon dies. Soon after, a sinister secret Ralph has harbored for years surfaces, and it is revealed Smike was Ralph's son, whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> dead. Realizing that his son had died the best friend of his most hated enemy, Ralph hangs himself. Nicholas marries Madeline and settles with her in Devon at his father's house and grounds, where Smike is buried.|$|E
25|$|In June 1892, Ranjitsinhji {{left the}} Borrisow home and, with {{monetary}} assistance from relations, moved {{into his own}} rooms {{in the city of}} Cambridge. He lived in luxury and frequently entertained guests lavishly. According to writer Alan Ross, Ranjitsinhji may have been lonely in his first years at Cambridge and probably encountered racism and prejudice. Ross believes that his generosity may have partly arisen from trying to overcome these barriers. However, Ranjitsinhji increasingly lived beyond his means {{to the point where he}} experienced financial difficulty. He intended to pass the examinations to be called to the Bar and wrote to ask Vibhaji to provide more money to cover the costs; Vibhaji sent the money on the condition Ranjitsinhji returned to India once he passed the examination. Ranjitsinhji intended to keep to this arrangement, although he did not plan a career as a barrister, but his debts were larger than <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> and not only could he not afford the cost of the Bar examination, he was forced to leave Cambridge University, without graduating, in spring 1894.|$|E
