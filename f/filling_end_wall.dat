40|$|Secondary flows {{have been}} long {{recognised}} {{as a significant}} form of loss mechanism in turbomachinery. They have a major influence over {{the performance of the}} blade rows since they cause unsteadiness in the mainstream flow. This consequently affects not only the mechanical integrity of the blades but also causes extra loss. This research is aimed to reduce secondary flows using a novel method; <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profiling. Profile 2 <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> was designed by Rolls Royce pic. with improved design features compared to its predecessor, Profile 1 <b>end</b> <b>wall.</b> Profile 2 <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> was manufactured and tested using the test facility available at the University of Durham. The flow was measured at two different axial positions, together with <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> static measurements and flow visualisation. The inlet flow conditions were also checked for consistency. These results were analysed and compared to Profile 1 and Planar <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profile results, which have been studied previously by Hartland [1999]. Profile 2 <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> achieved better secondary flow reduction compared to the Planar <b>end</b> <b>wall.</b> However Profile 1 <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> still proved to be better compared to both Profile 2 and the Planar <b>end</b> <b>wall.</b> This project has provided a thorough understanding of the various flow mechanisms in turbines and the available techniques in eliminating secondary flows. The application of <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profiling has still shown potential in being a reliable method. It is also important that the flow physics is understood in detail to determine the shape of the <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profile that will be effective...|$|R

The fences with heights of 12 mm, 16 mm were attached normal to the <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> and at a half pitch away from the blades.

The purpose of this project is to look into the secondary flow structure in the linear cascade and the influence of the shaped <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> on the secondary flow. By applying the non-axisymmetric <b>end</b> <b>wall,</b> the secondary flow is reduced compared to the flat <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> data. The yaw angle variation at the exit of the blade passage is reduced. The cascade was designed according to the nozzle guide vane from ALSTOM Energy Ltd. It was manufactured and connected to the low speed wind tunnel in the Thermo- Fluids Lab in Durham. The data acquisition system was designed and commissioned. Five hole probes were designed and calibrated according to the cascade test condition. The flow field with the flat <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> in the cascade was investigated using five hole probes through different traverse slots. Flow visualisations were conducted as well. The secondary flow structure and the loss development in the cascade are understood. Transitional trips were put on the blade surfaces and their effects on the secondary flow were observed. The CFD code was modified to fit the cascade case. It was validated against the Durham standard case and the flat <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> results. Different numerical schemes and turbulence models were evaluated. Different shaped <b>end</b> <b>walls</b> were systematically tested by the CFD code. The best <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profile was selected and manufactured. It was then tested in the cascade. Detailed investigations by five hole probes, flow visualisation and wall static pressure measurements were conducted.

40|$|The {{development}} of axial aircraft compressors {{has led to}} extremely high stage loadings and therewith reductions in entire engine size and weight. This trend also promotes several disadvantages such as the risks of flow separation and higher secondary flows {{that are associated with}} increased stage loading. The application of non-axisymmetric <b>end</b> <b>walls</b> is one approach to reduce blade loading in the <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> regions and to control <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> flow with the main objectives of increasing the component efficiency and the total pressure ratio. The emphasis of this work is to analyze the steady and unsteady performance of a transonic compressor stage with non-axisymmetric <b>end</b> <b>walls</b> where the profiled <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> serves to control the addressed flow inhomogeneities. The axisymmetric layout of Configuration I of the Darmstadt Transonic Compressor serves as the datum design. As a tool to find the optimum non-axisymmetric <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> shape, a fully-automated multi-objective optimizer connected to a steady 3 D-RANS flow solver is used. The goal is to analyze how effective such a design tool can work on such a challenging task and to derive first design rules and compare the differences and features in common to the experience made by turbine researchers. In this context, the stator and rotor row of the stage are subsequently and individually optimized. As a further step, the obtained optimized geometries are investigated in unsteady mode. The study demonstrates the potential of profiled <b>end</b> <b>walls</b> to suppress separation phenomena in a stator row with 2 D blading involving an enormous increase in efficiency. The exit flow field's whirl angle distribution is made more uniform which is generally desirable for the inlet conditions of a downstream stage. The profiled <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> design proofs to control the static pressure distribution which results in the migration of the loss cores from the <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> onto to the airfoil suction surface. This is identified as the main mechanism responsible for the obtained improvements. For the non-axisymmetric <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> design of the rotor row, a mechanism similar to the principle of lean is observed. The optimized rotor produces blockage and reduces the loss production in the outer regions (> 5 % channel height) at the expense of an increase in near hub <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> losses. This highlights the different effects of contoured <b>end</b> <b>walls</b> in the rotor and the stator rows and also provides the potential to serve as an alternative to design techniques such as 3 D-blading. The unsteady analyses of the different geometries confirm the impact of the rotor wake on the separation phenomena in the downstream stator which cannot be captured by the steady approach. However, they also demonstrate that unsteady phenomena can be neglected during the optimization process of the profiled <b>end</b> <b>walls</b> for this compressor configuration...|$|R

Small particles are fed into the drum continuously at the center region in the axial direction. The effect of rotating speed on the volumetric holdup and residence time of small particle is investigated.

40|$|Campbell {{diffusers}} have {{a unique}} feature in that they lack axial symmetry in the <b>end</b> <b>walls.</b> It has been proposed that the asymmetry of the <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> in a vaned diffuser can be tailored to improve its performance. This concept {{is applied to the}} redesign of two vaned diffuser configurations: (1) diffuser with straight leading edge; (2) diffuser with parabolic leading edge. In the redesign, the original axisymmetric <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> configuration is modified so that the resulting <b>end</b> <b>walls</b> on the pressure side converge from the leading edge to the throat and then diverge back to the original passage depth. Thus to maintain the same flow area distribution as the original vaned diffuser, the <b>end</b> <b>walls</b> on the suction side would have to be tailored so that they diverge {{from the beginning of the}} channel region to the throat before converging back to the original passage depth at the exit. A three dimensional inviscid Euler code is used to evaluate the performance of these diffusers.

Under the assumption that future demands are discrete, we characterize forecast horizons for these two variants as feasibility/optimality questions in 0 - 1 mixed integer programs. A detailed computational study establishes the effectiveness of our approach and enables us to gain valuable insights into the behavior of minimal forecast horizons.

40|$|A novel {{secondary}} flow feature, previously unreported for turbine blading {{as far as}} the authors are aware, has been discovered. It has been found {{that it is possible to}} separate part of the inlet boundary layer on the blade row <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> as it is being over-turned and rolled up into the passage vortex. This flow feature has been discovered during a continuing investigation into the aerodynamic effects of non-axisymmetric <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profiling. Previous work, using the low speed linear cascade at Durham University, has shown the potential of <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profiling for reducing secondary losses. The latest study, the results of which are described here, was undertaken to determine the limits of what <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profiling can achieve. The flow has been investigated in detail with pressure probe traversing and surface flow visualization. This has found that the inlet boundary locally separates, on the early suction side of the passage, generating significant extra loss which feeds directly into the core of the passage vortex. The presence of this new feature gives rise to the unexpected result that the {{secondary flow}}, as determined by the exit flow angle deviations and levels of secondary kinetic energy, can be reduced while at the same time the loss is increased. CFD was found to calculate the secondary flows moderately well compared with measurements. However, CFD did not predict this new feature, nor the increase in loss it caused. It is concluded that the application of non-axisymmetric <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profiling, although it has been shown to be highly beneficial, can give rise to adverse features that current CFD tools are unable to predict. Improvements to CFD capability are required in order to be able to avoid such features, and obtain the full potential of <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profiling...|$|R
