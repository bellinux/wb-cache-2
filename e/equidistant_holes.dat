50|$|The screw has a multi-start thread. The rollers and {{encapsulating}} {{rotating ring}} are identically grooved, not threaded, {{so there is}} no axial movement between the two. The nut assembly includes a cylindrical housing capped by non-rotating spacer rings. The spacer rings have <b>equidistant</b> <b>holes</b> that act as rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. Roller-type thrust bearings between the spacer rings and bearing ring permit free rotation of the bearing ring while transferring the axial load between the two.|$|E
50|$|With {{the table}} {{mounted on a}} {{secondary}} table, the workpiece is accurately centered on the rotary table's axis, {{which in turn is}} centered on the cutting tool's axis. All three axes are thus coaxial. From this point, the secondary table can be offset in either the X or Y direction to set the cutter the desired distance from the workpiece's center. This allows concentric machining operations on the workpiece. Placing the workpiece eccentrically a set distance from the center permits more complex curves to be cut. As with other setups on a vertical mill, the milling operation can be either drilling a series of concentric, and possibly <b>equidistant</b> <b>holes,</b> or face or end milling either circular or semicircular shapes and contours.|$|E
50|$|The nut {{and screw}} have {{identical}} multiple-start threads. The rollers have a single-start thread with an angle matching the nut thread. The matched thread angle prevents axial movement between the nut and the roller as the rollers spin. The nut assembly includes spacer rings and ring gears that position and guide the rollers. The spacer rings, which rotate within the ring gears, have <b>equidistant</b> <b>holes</b> {{that act as}} rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. The ring gears time the spinning and orbit of the rollers about the screw axis by engaging gear teeth near {{the ends of the}} rollers. The spacer rings rotate on axis with the screw in unison with the orbit of the rollers. The spacer rings float relative to the nut, axially secured by retaining rings, because they spin around the screw at a lower frequency (angular velocity) than the nut.|$|E

Owing to the trend towards reducing lead time and human effort, fixture design {{is one of the}} options.

40|$|AESTRACI A {{technique}} for displaying and analyzing Osgood's Semantic Differential data in three-dimensional semantic space is described. The technique emtloys a square board, with <b>equidistant</b> drilled <b>holes,</b> in which are placed dowels of various lengths combined with labels cf different shapes. Studies h,ve found 3 major factors (Evaluation, Activity, and Potency) in analyzing reactions of diverse subjects to different concepts on rating scales. Although, used togetner, these factors greater discrimination ti. an a unidimensional or bidimensional approach, there are difficulties in visualizing the relationships in three-dimensional data analyses, Methods for {{the preparation of}} instruments which allow balanced presentation and/or samplings of concepts, scales, origin and width of end points, are explained. These, instruments, analyses, and the display technique facilitate quick and easy interpretation and presentation cf semantic difiefential data. Several studies co [...] ucted, during the pas'. two years are used to illustrate both the approach and the type cf displays resulting from various subject groups, scales, and concepts. Example displays are illustrated {{in a series of}} photcsraphs. CIA...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{geometry}} of putting in the limiting case of a planar putting surface. Putts <b>equidistant</b> from the <b>hole</b> originating on an arc spanning ± 30 degrees are shown to share a common target point. Moving around the circle of all equidistant putts, the ensemble of target points map out a small, diamond-shaped structure centered on the fall line directly above the hole. The position and size of this target diamond for any length putt on a putting surface of any grade and speed is reasonably approximated by a single universal curve. This understanding suggests a practical methodology for reading putts. Instead of lining up only the putt-at-hand, the golfer should line up all putts known to share a common target point. This methodology will increase the probability of choosing the correct target line. Comment: 39 pages, 28 figure...|$|R
30|$|The {{apparatus}} {{was composed}} of a gray wooden box (40  cm ×  40  cm ×  25  cm) with sixteen <b>equidistant</b> <b>holes</b> 3  cm in diameter on the floor [22]. The center of each hole was 10  cm from the nearest wall of the box. The floor of the box was positioned 15  cm above the ground and divided into squares of (10  cm ×  10  cm) with a water-resistant marker. An animal placed {{at the center of}} the hole-board and allowed to explore the apparatus for 5  min. The total number of heads-dips recorded. The head dip scored if both eyes disappeared into the hole.|$|E
40|$|We study nanofibers with Bragg {{gratings}} from <b>equidistant</b> <b>holes.</b> We calculate analytically and numerically {{the reflection}} and transmission coefficients {{for a single}} grating and also for a cavity formed by two gratings. We show that the reflection and transmission coefficients of the gratings substantially depend {{on the number of}} holes, the hole length, the hole depth, the grating period, and the light wavelength. We find that the reflection and transmission coefficients of the gratings depend on the orientation of the polarization vector of light with respect to the holes. Such a dependence {{is a result of the}} fact that the cross section of the gratings is not cylindrically symmetric...|$|E
30|$|In HBT, head-dipping is {{generally}} considered {{as a measure of}} exploitation which is somehow distinct from the motor activity. An increase count of head dips compared to control is considered as anxiolytic-like effect. HBT was performed in a box (40 [*]×[*] 40 [*]×[*] 25  cm) made by wood with 16 <b>equidistant</b> <b>holes</b> (D- 3  cm) was used in this experiment. Apparatus was kept at 35  cm above from the ground [14]. Mice were selected and grouped into 4 groups randomly (each group consists of 5 mice) and administered different samples accordingly. Mouse was kept on board, and its movement and head dipping in the hole was counted for 5  min duration. A single head-dip was counted when a mouse put into the hole at least up to the eye level; repeated dips into same hole were not consider as countable head dips if they can’t be separated by locomotion.|$|E
40|$|Estudou-se a distribuição de substratos em duas colônias adultas (L- 1 e L- 2) da saúva Atta laevigata (F. Smith, 1858), com áreas de terra solta de 26, 10 e 31, 30 m 2. Alguns orifícios de abastecimento foram mapeados utilizando-se iscas de canudinhos plásticos impregnados com polpa cítrica. Depois selecionou-se três orifícios para o ninho L- 1 e um orifício para o ninho L- 2, onde foram colocadas iscas cítricas impregnadas com corantes azul, amarelo e vermelho e amarelo misturado com grãos de milho, respectivamente. Após 24 horas da colocação das iscas, as colônias foram mortas e escavadas totalmente. Durante a escavação, registrou-se a presença ou ausência dos corantes nas câmaras com cultura de fungo. Observou-se, neste trabalho, que as iscas com corantes distribuíram-se em todos os setores para os ninhos L- 1 e L- 2 e em todas as profundidades para o ninho L- 1. No entanto, em L- 2 encontrou-se corante nas profundidades de 1 a 4 m, independentemente do local em que foram colocadas, indicando que as iscas formicidas colocadas em apenas um orifício de abastecimento da colônia, podem ser distribuídas uniformemente pelo ninho. Substrate {{distribution}} in was studied two adult leaf cutting ant Atta laevigata (F. Smith, 1858) colonies (L- 1 and L- 2), with 26. 10 and 31. 30 m 2 areas of refuse soil. Some nest holes were mapped {{through the use}} of baits made of small plastic straws soaked with citric pulp. Three <b>holes,</b> <b>equidistant</b> from one another, were then selected for nest L- 1, and a single hole in nest L- 2. Blue-, yellow - and red-colored citric baits, and yellow baits plus corn, were placed in nests L- 1 and L- 2, respectively. After 24 hours from the deposition of the baits, the colonies were killed and totally excavated. During digging, {{the presence or absence of}} dye baits in the chambers containing fungi, was registered. It was observed that the baits were distributed in all sectors of L- 1 and L- 2 nests and in all depths only for L- 1. However, the dyed baits of L- 2 nest were detected from 1 to 4 meters deep, independently of the places where the baits were disposed. Thus, it can be concluded that toxic baits placed in a single supply-hole of a colony are uniformly distributed inside the nest...|$|R
