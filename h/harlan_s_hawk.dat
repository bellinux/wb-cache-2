40|$|THE MODULATION OF THE ADRENOCORTICAL STRESS RESPONSE IN NORTH AMERICAN ACCIPITERS DURING FALL MIGRATION Birds {{must build}} fat stores through {{increased}} foraging and food consumption {{to ensure a}} successful migration. Such hyperphagy is facilitated by an increase of corticosterone secreted from the adrenal glands. To prevent catabolism of flight muscles during migration, birds must modulate their normal stress responses to avoid additional corticosterone release. I tested three species of Accipiter hawks (Sharp-shinned Hawks (Accipiter striatus), Cooper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Hawks</b> (A. cooperi), and Northern Goshawks (A. gentilis)) captured during fall migration in southern Idaho for modulation of their stress responses. Each hawk underwent a standard stress protocol with blood taken at 0 min and 30 min after capture. Blood was analyzed for corticosterone levels using radioimmunoassay techniques. No significant difference in corticosterone levels between times 0 min and 30 min was seen, indicating that Accipiter hawks do not significantly increase corticosterone secretion when stressed during migration. I found no significant difference in baseline corticosterone between males and females in Sharp-shinned Hawks and Northern Goshawks, but a significant difference was found between the sexes in Cooper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Hawks.</b> In all three species, {{there was no significant difference}} in baseline corticosterone between hatch year and after-hatch year hawks. My results support the Migration Modulation Hypothesis and indicate that Accipiter hawks, like other birds, can dampen their stress responses while on migration, probably to prevent catabolism of their flight muscles when fat stores have been depleted. CORTICOSTERONE SECRETION IN RELATION TO FLIGHT STRATEGIES AND ENERGY EXPENDITURE IN NORTH AMERICAN ACCIPITERS DURING FALL MIGRATION Migration is a vital part of the yearly cycle for many birds and is classified as the seasonal movement between breeding and non-breeding areas. In preparation for migration, birds increase the levels or corticosterone secreted by their adrenal glands. This not only prepares them for migration, but also aids in ensuring that there is adequate energy (glucose) available for long distance flight. There are a variety of factors that affect the baseline level of corticosterone in birds. These can include size, flight behavior, energetics, and migratory status. I analyzed three species of hawks (Sharp-shinned Hawks (Accipiter striatus), Cooper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Hawks</b> (A. cooperi), and Northern Goshawks (A. gentilis)) captured during fall migration through southern Idaho for variations in their baseline corticosterone levels and compared those to their estimated flight energy expenditure, size and flight measurements, and migratory status. Among the three Accipiter species, I found significant differences in baseline corticosterone with the Sharp-shinned Hawk and Northern Goshawk having similar levels and Cooper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Hawks</b> having levels nearly twice as high. I found no significant difference in baseline corticosterone between males and females in Sharp-shinned Hawks and Northern Goshawks, but a significant difference was found between the sexes in Cooper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Hawks.</b> In all three species, I found no significant difference in baseline corticosterone between hatch year and after-hatch year hawks. Estimated flight energy expenditure showed significant differences between the Accipiters, and appears to show that Cooper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Hawks</b> are energetically at a disadvantage compared to Sharp-shinned Hawks and Northern Goshawks. I found that all the flight measurements were significantly different among the Accipiters. Male and female Sharp-shinned Hawks and Cooper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Hawks</b> showed significant differences in all measurements except aspect ratio, but there were no differences in flight measurements between the two age groups for those two Accipiters. In Northern Goshawks, I found significant differences in the all flight measurements except wing area between the single after-hatch year female and the hatch year males. My results show that size is not the only factor that determines baseline corticosterone levels in Accipiter hawks during fall migration. Flight behavior and energetics also appear to playa role, but the one factor that appeared to have the most impact was migratory status.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of habitat {{parameters}} and human disturbance on the nesting success of goshawks, Cooper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hawks,</b> and sharp-shinned hawks in an area within the Cache National Forest of Utah and Idaho. This research should provide the wildlife manager with information of value in planning recreation areas, roads, timber cuttings, and other activities where impacts are considered. Of the three accipiter species studied, the goshawk showed the greatest preference for isolation from man. It nested at higher elevations (X= 2, 065 m); farther from human disturbance (X= 250 m); higher in trees (X= 12 m) / farther into cover (X= 55 m) [generally in a mature forest]; and in proximity to water (X= 394 m) with considerable horizontal visibility form the nest (X= 53 m). The average number of young fledged from goshawk nests was 1. 4. The nesting Cooper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hawk</b> was more tolerant to human disturbance (X= 147 m); nested closest to water (X= 220 m); at moderate elevation (X= 1, 782 m); and in average of 8 m above ground. Their range over-lapped that of recreational activities and also that of sharp-shinned hawks. Cooper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hawks</b> fledged an average of 1. 6 young per nest. The sharp-shinned hawks nested farthest from water (X= 444 m); at about the same elevation as Cooper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hawks</b> (X= 1, 789 m); closer to human disturbance (X= 161 m); closer to the ground (X= 6 m); and in nests with short horizontal visibility (X= 14 m).

40|$|Background Relatively {{little is}} known about the degree of inter-specific {{variability}} in visual scanning strategies in species with laterally placed eyes (e. g., birds). This is relevant because many species detect prey while perching; therefore, head movement behavior may be an indicator of prey detection rate, a central parameter in foraging models. We studied head movement strategies in three diurnal raptors belonging to the Accipitridae and Falconidae families. Methodology/Principal Findings We used behavioral recording of individuals under field and captive conditions to calculate the rate of two types of head movements and the interval between consecutive head movements. Cooper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Hawks</b> had the highest rate of regular head movements, which can facilitate tracking prey items in the visually cluttered environment they inhabit (e. g., forested habitats). On the other hand, Red-tailed Hawks showed long intervals between consecutive head movements, which is consistent with prey searching in less visually obstructed environments (e. g., open habitats) and with detecting prey movement from a distance with their central foveae. Finally, American Kestrels have the highest rates of translational head movements (vertical or frontal displacements of the head keeping the bill in the same direction), which have been associated with depth perception through motion parallax. Higher translational head movement rates may be a strategy to compensate for the reduced degree of eye movement of this species. Conclusions Cooper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Hawks,</b> Red-tailed Hawks, and American Kestrels use both regular and translational head movements, but to different extents. We conclude that these diurnal raptors have species-specific strategies to gather visual information while perching. These strategies may optimize prey search and detection with different visual systems in habitat types with different degrees of visual obstruction...|$|R
