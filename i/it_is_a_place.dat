Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of the No-Face. In stark contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constant chaotic carnival in the background.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of 4 consists of mid-tempo pieces, {{but unlike the}} filler that might have occupied this pacing on previous albums, many of this album’s greatest strengths lie in this realm. Perhaps best exemplifying this spirit is the André 3000 and Kanye West assisted, 'Party' in which Beyoncé relaxes into a beat that, while {{not be easy to}} grind to, still works perfectly as a party anthem. Beyoncé reminds us that a party is not only meant for dancing. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where you go to enjoy the company of others and oftentimes, that involves real human conversation and interaction. Echoing this sentiment, André’s verse is tranquilized from his customarily rapid-fire delivery to a drawl more reminiscent of Lil’ Wayne than his traditional work with Outkast. 'Party' like much of 4, is a conversation, and André 3000 wants to be heard.|$|E
5|$|Unlike mosques {{situated}} in urban settings in West Africa, the Larabanga Mosque is comparatively small. Rural mosques, like Larabanga's, were usually conceived {{by a single}} marabout and loosely based on styles seen elsewhere {{such as in the}} Great Mosque of Djenné. In order to achieve a physical resemblance to the architecture used elsewhere, the Larabanga Mosque had to incorporate large buttresses in order to compensate for the poorer quality of building materials. Larabanga is one of eight ancient and highly revered mosques in Ghana, and is also the oldest. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of pilgrimage and is considered the Mecca of West Africa.|$|E

25|$|Looking back, {{the total}} lack of a comic book scene in the early 2000s proved to have a {{cleansing}} effect and pushed many to rebuild the whole scene from its base. The first to act were remaining hardcore fans, who began to organize into web communities on Internet forums and a new scene developed {{on the basis of}} scanlations. Since no comic books were sold on the market, fans began to scan, translate, re-letter and share digital comics. In English speaking countries scanlations usually refer to manga, but in Hungary the process of fan translations and lettering started with Marvel superhero-type comics, and then moved on to other types. The most notable achievement of the Hungarian scanlating scene was that it brought together the fans, forming a base of comics fandom. Although many different websites existed, each specializing in different comics genres, types (European, superhero, independent, manga, underground, etc.), Kepregeny.net managed to unite all different kind of comics fans. Kepregeny.net also started out as a scanlating and scanning website, its forum provided a platform for fans and professionals (artists, editors of earlier series, retailers etc.) to meet and discuss all kinds of issues. Many projects were eventually launched from there, and to this day <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> for fan talk and professional debate and most notably Kepregeny.net can be regarded as the main information gateway for all comics fans and professionals.|$|E

Many of these buildings derive their design from traditional Malay items such as the songkok and the keris. Some of these buildings have Islamic geometric motifs integrated with the designs of the building, signifying Islamic restriction on imitating nature through drawings. Examples of these buildings are Menara Telekom, Menara Maybank, Dayabumi Complex, and the Islamic Centre. Some buildings such as the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia and National Planetarium have been built to masquerade as a place of worship, complete with dome and minaret, when in fact <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of science and knowledge. The [...] tall Petronas Twin Towers are the tallest twin buildings in the world. They were designed to resemble motifs found in Islamic art.|$|E

In 1988 the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, precursor to the DCNR, described it as about 95% State owned, unroaded, and designated the Pine Creek Gorge Natural Area. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of unique geologic history and contains some rare plant communities, an old growth hemlock stand, ... active bald eagle nest ... and is a major site of river otter reintroduction.

500|$|Other {{philosophers}} and writers identified as influences include Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ray Brassier, Emil Cioran, and Eugene Thacker. Mathijs Peters, {{in a piece}} for Film International, argued that True Detective probes Schopenhauerian philosophy through its approach to individuality, self-denial, the battle between dark and light, and so forth. Ben Woodard noted the show's evolving philosophy, which examines a setting where culture, religion, and society are direct by-products of biological weakness. Woodward wrote, [...] "Biological programming gets recuperated and socially redistributed visions, faiths, and acerbic personalities take the reins of uncertain ends creating a world where 'people go away'." [...] Even the setting, Fintan Neylan argued, emphasizes a world [...] "where the decrepitude of human ordering cannot be hidden." [...] He stated, [...] "This {{is not a place}} where hope fled; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where hope could never take root. It is with these people and environs that the real horror is sourced." [...] Yet Neylan observed that Cohle's actions are not motivated by misanthropy, rather a drive to challenge [...] "those who try to either disguise or manipulate this frailty of humans for their own benefit." [...] And in doing so, Cohle ultimately confronts [...] "an entire philosophical history which has taken its task as that of sweeping frailty away." [...] Christopher Orr at The Atlantic said True Detective was [...] "Fincherian in the best sense", a fusion of Se7en (1995) and Zodiac (2007), because of its subject matter, sleek cinematography, and [...] "vivid, unsettling" [...] aura.|$|E
