40|$|Low-head bubbler {{irrigation}} systems are particularly well-suited for the irrigation of orchard crops, and these systems differ from other micor{{irrigation systems}} {{because they are}} based on gravity-flow, can operate at pressures as low as 1 meter (3. 3 ft), and do not require elaborate filtration systems. A design procedure for low-head bubbler systems is described in detail, and example designs for bubbler systems located on level ground and gradual slopes are also presented. The design procedure utilizes head loss gradient charts based on the Darcy-Weisbach equation to size the pipe diameters, and the <b>delivery</b> <b>hose</b> elevations are calculated by using a personal computer with spreadsheet software. The causes of air locks in the laterals and <b>delivery</b> <b>hoses</b> are also investigated, and minimum design flow rates for various pipe diameters are recommended to ensure flow velocities are high enough to prevent air locks from occurring within the <b>delivery</b> <b>hoses...</b>|$|R

40|$|Analysis {{indicates}} that the Blasius equation yields accurate estimates of head loss in small diameter plastic tubing and larger diameter PVC pipe for Reynolds numbers upto 100, 000. The Hazen-Williams equation with suitable roughness parameter values also predicts head loss accurately. The results of laboratory experiments reveal that the undulations which are created during field installation are {{the primary cause of}} air locking in the <b>delivery</b> <b>hose.</b> The additional head needed to release the trapped air was found to be equal to the sum of heights of all the undulations. If the sum of their heights exceeds the design head loss in the <b>delivery</b> <b>hose,</b> air locking will result. The capital investment for bubbler system under study was comparable to that of a pressurized drip system. Long term savings in terms of energy and maintenance make low head bubbler systems an attractive alternative to pressurized drip systems for irrigating orchards or vineyards...|$|R

However, unlike the useful firehooks, these large pumps had rarely proved flexible or functional enough to make much difference. Only some of them had wheels; others were mounted on wheelless sleds. They had to be brought a long way, tended to arrive too late, and had limited reach, with spouts but no <b>delivery</b> <b>hoses.</b>|$|R

25|$|One {{reason for}} the fire's {{duration}} {{was the lack of}} national standards in fire-fighting equipment. Although fire engines from nearby cities (such as Philadelphia and Washington, as well as units from New York, Wilmington, and Atlantic City) responded, many were useless because their <b>hose</b> <b>couples</b> failed to fit Baltimore hydrants. As a result, the fire burned over 30 hours, destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks.|$|R

50|$|The National Fire Protection Association {{adopted a}} {{national}} standard for fire hydrant and hose connections. However, inertia remained. Conversion {{was slow and}} still remains incomplete. One hundred years after the Baltimore Fire, only 18 of the 48 most populous American cities {{were reported to have}} national standard fire hydrants. Hose incompatibility contributed to the Oakland Firestorm of 1991: although the standard <b>hose</b> <b>coupling</b> has 2.5 in diameter, Oakland's hydrants had 3 in couplings.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{dramatic}} incidents affected Verstappen at the German Grand Prix. During his first scheduled pitstop during the race, fuel leaked onto the car after the fuel hose was disconnected. The car, with Verstappen in it, was engulfed in flames for several seconds. As was usual at the time, Verstappen had slightly opened the visor of his helmet for the pit stop, but apart from slight burns to his nose, he was uninjured. After this incident the fuel <b>delivery</b> <b>hose</b> was modified to incorporate a fail-safe cut-out system.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{invention}} of the vulcanization process as a means of curing raw soft rubber into a harder, more useful product, the fire service slowly made the transition from bulky and unreliable leather hose to the unlined linen hose, then to a multi-layer, rubber lined and coated hose with interior fabric reinforcement. This rubber hose was as bulky, heavy, and stiff as a leather hose, but was not prone to leaking. It also proved more durable than unlined linen hose. Its wrapped construction resembled some hoses used today by industry, for example, fuel <b>delivery</b> <b>hoses</b> used to service airliners.|$|R

50|$|Pipes are {{commonly}} joined by welding, using threaded pipe and fittings; sealing {{the connection with}} a pipe thread compound, Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Thread seal tape, oakum, or PTFE string, or by using a mechanical coupling. Process piping is usually joined by welding using a TIG or MIG process. The most common process pipe joint is the butt weld. The ends of pipe to be welded must have a certain weld preparation called an End Weld Prep (EWP) which is typically at an angle of 37.5 degrees to accommodate the filler weld metal. The most common pipe thread in North America is the National Pipe Thread (NPT) or the Dryseal (NPTF) version. Other pipe threads include the British standard pipe thread (BSPT), the garden hose thread (GHT), and the fire <b>hose</b> <b>coupling</b> (NST).|$|R

40|$|A {{modification}} {{has been}} made in the mating halves of a cam-and-groove <b>hose</b> <b>coupling</b> to prevent rapid separation of the halves in the event that the cam levers are released while the fluid in the hose is pressurized. The need for this modification arises because commercial off-the-shelf cam-and-groove hose-coupling halves do not incorporate safety features to prevent separation in the pressurized state. Especially when the pressurized fluid is compressible (e. g., steam or compressed air), the separated halves can be propelled with considerable energy, causing personal injury and/or property damage. Therefore, one purpose served by the modification is to provide for venting to release compressive energy in a contained and safe manner while preventing personal injury and/or property damage. Another purpose served by the modification, during the process of connecting the coupling halves, is to ensure that the coupling halves are properly aligned before the cam levers can be locked into position...|$|R
40|$|The {{admixture}} of used {{engine oil}} blended with kerosene {{as a substitute}} for industrial fuel was experimented to determine it’s viability for use as an industrial fuel in foundry workshop. Various types of industrial fuel exist, some of which include diesel containing 84. 4 % of carbon, 11. 7 % of hydrogen, 1. 4 % of nitrogen and 0. 60 % of sulphur, a boiling point of about 550 0 F (287. 78 0 C), of 250 o F (121. 11 0 C) and it fractionated pouring temperature of 515 0 F(268. 33 0 C). Equipment used for the experiment include crucible furnace, fuel tank, inlet pipe, wire gauze, flexible hose, the injector nozzles, the electric motor blower, the <b>delivery</b> <b>hose,</b> the control knob, the mixture chamber, the combustion chamber, and the crucible pots (the excavators). Four liters of the mixture of used engine oil to kerosene at a varying ratio of 2 : 1, 3 : 2, 5 : 3, 5 : 2, 3 : 1, 4 : 1, 5 : 1 and 6 : 1 was used to carry out the test.

500|$|As {{part of the}} rebreather itself. The rebreather {{must have}} at least one source of fresh gas stored in a cylinder; many have two and some have more cylinders. Due to the lower gas {{consumption}} of rebreathers, these cylinders typically are smaller than those used for equivalent open-circuit dives. Rebreathers may use internal cylinders, or may also be supplied from [...] "off-board" [...] cylinders, which are not directly plumbed into the rebreather, but connected to it by a flexible <b>hose</b> and <b>coupling</b> and usually carried side slung.|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{positive}} airway pressure (CPAP) {{is a type}} {{of respiratory}} ventilation originally developed for combating sleep apnea, which remains its primary use. It is also useful in providing ventilation for newborns and anyone suffering respiratory failure. As airway muscles relax during sleep, the airway can become partially obstructed. This can lead to lower blood oxygenation and cause awakening or arousal from deep sleep. Maintaining positive air pressure by supplying a continuous source of compressed air, the face mask forms a seal to the face. It is only this air pressure that maintains the open airway, and not the actual movement of air. A sleep physician usually determines the required air pressure after completing a sleep study. Pressure sensors supply feedback of the applied air pressure in the mask/ <b>delivery</b> <b>hose</b> to the microprocessor controller. This microprocessor controller manages the motor-drive stage of a compressor to maintain the correct fan velocity necessary to generate the required air pressure. The main subfunctions that the system is required to monitor and control can be divided as follows: 1. Air-hose-environment sensing This covers air pressure, but may also include air temperature, humidity, and flow rate. 2. Compressor motor-drive feedback Similar to all motordrive systems, some feedback must be provided to maintain torque and/or velocity control. Typically, phase currents or shunt current and rotor feedback must be provided. 3. Motor-drive excitation This is the generation of the waveforms necessary to both induce current in the electric motor an...|$|R
5000|$|AirFLEX - This vehicle {{incorporate}} three {{special service}} fireground support functions into one apparatus. The first service is air cascade and breathing apparatus support. AirFLEX units {{are equipped with}} a supply of extra, full SCBA cylinders and a cascade and compressor for filling SCBA and SCUBA cylinders {{at the scene of}} incidents, as well as basic repair service for SCBA components. AirFLEX can also provide static breathing air via air lines for specialized rescues such as confined space, etc. The second service is floodlight service. Historically, in the fire service, before every front-line apparatus was equipped with power inverters, generators, and scene lighting, stand-alone floodlight units responded to support night-time operations. Original AirFLEX units were equipped with multiple portable floodlight fixtures for such operations, but have adapted to current needs; modern AirFLEX units are equipped with mobile light towers for scene lighting at incidents. The third service is high-expansion foam. Each AirFLEX unit is equipped with a high expansion foam generator, a supply of foam concentrate, and the <b>delivery</b> <b>hose.</b> High-expansion foam is traditionally used for stubborn fires in below-grade or confined environments, where water cannot adequately penetrate, and entry by firefighters is unsafe or unrealistic. In addition to the three [...] "namesake" [...] services, AirFLEX units also provide drinking water for fire scenes, and a supply of freshly charged portable radio batteries for extended incidents. AirFLEX units are staffed by one Emergency Vehicle Driver (or acting EVD). Two front-line AirFLEX units are in service continuously, splitting the city east and west of Charles Street for primary service. An AirFLEX unit is dispatched on working fires, or fires where the Fire Communications Bureau believes that the balance of companies will be utilizing SCBA. An AirFLEX unit is also dispatched automatically on any report of a fire in an ocean-going ship at port, fires below grade (tunnels), and on responses where the SCUBA team is utilized.|$|R
