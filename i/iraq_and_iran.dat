5|$|By 59 BC an {{unofficial}} political alliance {{known as the}} First Triumvirate was formed between Gaius Julius Caesar, Marcus Licinius Crassus, and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great") to share power and influence. In 53 BC, Crassus launched a Roman invasion of the Parthian Empire (modern <b>Iraq</b> <b>and</b> <b>Iran).</b> After initial successes, he marched his army deep into the desert; but here his army was cut off deep in enemy territory, surrounded and slaughtered at the Battle of Carrhae in which Crassus himself perished. The death of Crassus removed some of the balance in the Triumvirate and, consequently, Caesar and Pompey began to move apart. While Caesar was fighting in Gaul, Pompey proceeded with a legislative agenda for Rome that revealed {{that he was at}} best ambivalent towards Caesar and perhaps now covertly allied with Caesar's political enemies. In 51 BC, some Roman senators demanded that Caesar not be permitted to stand for consul unless he turned over control of his armies to the state, which would have left Caesar defenceless before his enemies. Caesar chose civil war over laying down his command and facing trial.|$|E

He recommended that state sponsors of terror, including Sudan, Libya, <b>Iraq</b> <b>and</b> <b>Iran,</b> be considered as possible places of sanctuary if the U.S. were to attack Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|Illegal Immigrants and would-be {{asylum seekers}} {{have used the}} tunnel to attempt to enter Britain.

25|$|Southwest Asian Neanderthals are Neanderthals {{that lived}} in Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Syria, <b>Iraq,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Iran,</b> the southernmost expanse of their known range.

At this time, Homo sapiens seems to have replaced them {{in one of the}} first anatomically modern expansions out of Africa. In their turn, starting around 80,000 years ago, Neanderthals seem to have replaced Homo sapiens in Southwest Asia. They inhabited the region until about 55,000 years ago.|$|E

In the northern Syrian, eastern Anatolian region of the Levant, Natufian culture at Cayonu and Mureybet developed the first fully agricultural culture with the addition of wild grains, later being supplemented with domesticated sheep and goats, which were probably domesticated first by the Zarzian culture of Northern <b>Iraq</b> <b>and</b> <b>Iran</b> (which like the Natufian culture may have also developed from Kebaran).|$|E

The Irish provided 177 of the 400 UNIIMOG personnel involved with the mission. The mission came to an end in 1991, when Iran and Iraq completed the withdrawal of their troops.
