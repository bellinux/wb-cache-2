50|$|There are {{two basic}} {{components}} in an EMAT transducer. One is a magnet {{and the other is}} an <b>electric</b> <b>coil.</b> The magnet can be a permanent magnet or an electromagnet, which produces a static or a quasi-static magnetic field. In EMAT terminology, this field is called bias magnetic field. The <b>electric</b> <b>coil</b> is driven with an alternating current (AC) electric signal at ultrasonic frequency, typically in the range from 20 kHz to 10 MHz. Based on the application needs, the signal can be a continuous wave, a spike pulse, or a tone-burst signal. The <b>electric</b> <b>coil</b> with AC current also generates an AC magnetic field. When the test material is close to the EMAT, ultrasonic waves are generated in the test material through the interaction of the two magnetic fields.|$|E

50|$|With the {{toroidal}} core winding technology an <b>electric</b> <b>coil</b> or winding {{is created}} by winding an electrical conductor (e.g. copper wire) through the circular ring and evenly distributing it over the circumference (Toroidal inductors and transformers, toroidal chokes).|$|E
5000|$|A hydride {{compressor}} is {{a hydrogen}} compressor based on metal hydrides with absorption of hydrogen at low pressure and desorption of hydrogen at high pressure {{by raising the}} temperature with an external heat source like a heated waterbed or <b>electric</b> <b>coil.</b>|$|E

25|$|As with 100% {{biodiesel}} (B100), {{to ensure}} the fuel injectors atomize the vegetable oil in the correct pattern for efficient combustion, vegetable oil fuel must be heated to reduce its viscosity to that of diesel, either by <b>electric</b> <b>coils</b> or heat exchangers.

30|$|The {{electromagnetic}} actuation allows {{an increased}} scanning angle under a low operational voltage. The Lorentz force induces attractive and repulsive actuation, {{which can be}} selectively generated by changing {{the direction of a}} current flow inside active <b>electric</b> <b>coils</b> or permalloy. However, the compulsory existence of <b>electric</b> <b>coils</b> hampers the size reduction of an endomicroscopic package. Miller et al. have demonstrated a 1 D micromirror with a rotation angle over 60 ° [32] (Fig.  3 b). The structure of the scanner is composed of a single-crystalline silicon plane (4  ×  4  ×  0.04  mm 3) tethered to the bulk silicon substrate by two serpentine springs. A permalloy layer (3  mm × 3  mm) which is located on the bottom side of plate induces the magnetic actuation. Kim et al. [22] have also reported an electromagnetic gimballed 2 D MEMS mirror. A rectangular MEMS mirror is mounted on a two-axis gimbal platform with folded flexible hinges. The device features a mirror plate of 0.6  mm ×  0.8  mm within a footprint size of 2.4  mm ×  2.9  mm under a post-objective configuration. The resonant frequencies for each axis are 450 and 350  Hz, respectively, and the mechanical rotation angle is around 40 ° at 3  Vpp operational voltages for the fast and slow axes.|$|R

5000|$|In 2013 and 2014 DOE {{developed}} and proposed new test procedures for cooking products to allow direct comparison of efficiency measurements among induction, electric resistance, and gas cooking tops and ranges. The procedures use a new hybrid test block made of aluminum and stainless steel, {{so it is}} suitable for tests on induction cookers. The proposed rule lists results of real lab tests conducted with the hybrid block. For comparable (large) cooking elements the following efficiencies were measured with ±0.5% repeatability: 70.7% - 73.6% for induction, 71.9% for <b>electric</b> <b>coil,</b> 43.9% for gas. Summarizing the results of several tests, DOE affirms that [...] "induction units have an average efficiency of 72.2%, not {{significantly higher than the}} 69.9% efficiency of smooth—electric resistance units, or the 71.2% of <b>electric</b> <b>coil</b> units".

50|$|Demagnetization is the {{reduction}} or elimination of magnetization. One {{way to do}} this is to heat the object above its Curie temperature, where thermal fluctuations have enough energy to overcome exchange interactions, the source of ferromagnetic order, and destroy that order. Another way is to pull it out of an <b>electric</b> <b>coil</b> with alternating current running through it, giving rise to fields that oppose the magnetization.|$|E
50|$|The AC {{current in}} the <b>electric</b> <b>coil</b> generates eddy current {{on the surface}} of the material. According to theory of {{electromagnetic}} induction, the distribution of the eddy current is only at a very thin layer of the material, called skin depth. This depth reduces with the increase of AC frequency, the material conductivity, and permeability. Typically for 1 MHz AC excitation, the skin depth is only a fraction of a millimeter for primary metals like steel, copper and aluminum. The eddy current in the magnetic field experiences Lorentz force. In a microscopic view, the Lorentz force is applied on the electrons in the eddy current. In a macroscopic view, the Lorentz force is applied on the surface region of the material due to interaction between electrons and atoms. The distribution of Lorentz force is controlled by the design of magnet, and design of the <b>electric</b> <b>coil,</b> the properties of the test material, relative position between the transducer and the test part, and the excitation signal for the transducer.|$|E

Then a slowly-spinning rod, the [...] "seed", is lowered into the crucible, circulating the molten minerals, creating a homogeneous mixture and maintaining an even temperature throughout.

50|$|All-{{electric}} {{heat pump}} systems have an electric furnace or electric resistance heat, or strip heat, which typically consists of rows of <b>electric</b> <b>coils</b> that heat up. A fan blows over the heated coils and circulates warm air throughout the home. This {{serves as an}} adequate heating source, but as temperatures go down, electricity costs rise. Electrical service outages pose the same threat as to central forced-air systems and pump-based boilers, but woodstoves and non-electric fireplace inserts can mitigate this risk. Some ASHPs can be coupled to solar panels as primary energy source, with a conventional electric grid as backup source.|$|R
50|$|The linear {{induction}} motor is a simple but powerful type of electric motor used to propel the cars.

By applying a multiphase alternating current to the poles, the pole plate induces eddy currents into the moving plate and can be used to accelerate or brake the car.|$|R

50|$|A {{ferromagnetic}} material {{will have a}} dimensional change when an external magnetic field is applied. This effect is called magnetostriction.

In some cases, the response can be improved significantly with the change of relative direction between bias magnetic field and AC magnetic field. Quantitatively, the magnetostriction may be described in a similar mathematical format as piezoelectric constants. Empirically, a lot of experience is needed to fully understand the magnetostriction phenomenon.|$|E

50|$|The basic, {{open-loop}} accelerometer {{consists of}} a mass attached to a spring. The mass is constrained to move only {{in line with the}} spring. Acceleration causes deflection of the mass and the offset distance is measured. The acceleration is derived from the values of deflection distance, mass, and the spring constant. The system must also be damped to avoid oscillation.A closed-loop accelerometer achieves higher performance by using a feedback loop to cancel the deflection, thus keeping the mass nearly stationary. Whenever the mass deflects, the feedback loop causes an <b>electric</b> <b>coil</b> to apply an equally negative force on the mass, canceling the motion. Acceleration is derived from the amount of negative force applied. Because the mass barely moves, the effects of non-linearities of the spring and damping system are greatly reduced. In addition, this accelerometer provides for increased bandwidth beyond the natural frequency of the sensing element.|$|E
50|$|While the tDCS {{method is}} gaining interest, the most {{commonly}} used method of brain stimulation is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This technique of brain stimulation utilizes an <b>electric</b> <b>coil</b> held above the region of interest on the scalp that uses rapidly changing magnetic fields to induce small electrical currents in the brain. There are two types of TMS: repetitive TMS and single pulse TMS. Both are used in research therapy but effects lasting longer than the stimulation period are only observed in repetitive TMS. Similar to tDCS, an increase or decrease in neuronal activity can be achieved using this technique, but the method of how this is induced is very different. Transcranial direct current stimulation has the two different directions of current that cause the different effects. Increased neuronal activity is induced in repetitive TMS by using a higher frequency and decreased neuronal activity is induced by using a lower frequency.|$|E
