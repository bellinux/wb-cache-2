5|$|Coatbridge is {{especially}} {{noted for its}} historical links with Ireland. This <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> large scale immigration into the town from Ulster (especially from County Donegal) in the 19th century and {{throughout most of the}} 20th century. Indeed, the town has been called 'little Ireland'.|$|E
5|$|The colour of C.maenas varies greatly, {{from green}} to brown, grey or red. This {{variation}} has a genetic component, but <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> local environmental factors. In particular, individuals which delay moulting become red–coloured rather than green. Red individuals are {{stronger and more}} aggressive, but are less tolerant of environmental stresses, such as low salinity or hypoxia. Juvenile crabs on average display greater patterning than adults.|$|E
5|$|Though {{relationships}} within the Abelisauridae are debated, Carnotaurus is consistently {{shown to be}} one of the most derived members of the family by cladistical analyses. Its nearest relative might have been either Aucasaurus or Majungasaurus; this ambiguity <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the incompleteness of the Aucasaurus skull material. A recent review suggests that Carnotaurus was not closely related with either Aucasaurus or Majungasaurus, and instead proposed Ilokelesia as its sister taxon.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it is an}} attractive-looking bolete, Caloboletus calopus is not {{considered}} edible on account of its very bitter taste, which does not disappear upon cooking. There are reports of it being eaten in far eastern Russia and Ukraine. The bitter taste <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the compounds calopin and a δ-lactone derivative, O-acetylcyclocalopinA. These compounds contains a structural motif known as a 3-methylcatechol unit, which is rare in natural products. A total synthesis of calopin was reported in 2003.|$|E
5|$|On Election Day, Goldwater {{lost the}} {{election}} to Johnson by {{what was then the}} largest margin in history. Goldwater accumulated 52 electoral votes to Johnson's 486 and 39% of the popular vote (27,178,188) to Johnson's 61% (43,129,566). Goldwater carried six states: Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina and his home state of Arizona. Goldwater's strong showing in the south <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> his support of the white southern view on civil rights: that states should be able to control their own laws without federal intervention.|$|E
5|$|This species {{grows in}} at least 2 {{distinct}} sub-populations, {{both of which are}} well protected by Sabah National Parks Authority. One of the populations grows in an area public access to which is strictly prohibited without permit. However, there has been a decline in population of mature individuals in the better known and less patrolled site. This <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> damage to habitat and plants by careless visitors rather than organised collection of plants. Nepenthes rajah has become common in cultivation in recent years {{as a result of the}} availability of inexpensive clones from tissue culture. I believe that these days commercial collection of this species from the wild is negligible.|$|E

5|$|The {{capybara}} and {{the lesser}} capybara {{belong to the}} subfamily Hydrochoerinae along with the rock cavies. The living capybaras and their extinct relatives were previously classified in their own family Hydrochoeridae. Since 2002, molecular phylogenetic studies have recognized a close relationship between Hydrochoerus and Kerodon, the rock cavies, supporting placement of both genera in a subfamily of Caviidae. Paleontological classifications have yet to incorporate this new taxonomy and continue to use Hydrochoeridae for all capybaras, while using Hydrochoerinae for the living genus and its closest fossil relatives, such as Neochoerus. The taxonomy of fossil hydrochoerines is also {{in a state of}} flux. In recent years, the diversity of fossil hydrochoerines has been substantially reduced. This <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the recognition that capybara molar teeth show strong variation in shape over the life of an individual. In one instance, material once referred to four genera and seven species on the basis of differences in molar shape is now thought to represent differently aged individuals of a single species, Cardiatherium paranense.|$|E

25|$|Most {{of these}} public health {{concerns}} {{have focused on}} children who are infected with hookworm.

25|$|Fentanyl {{provides}} some of the effects typical of other opioids through its agonism of the opioid receptors. Its strong potency in relation to that of morphine <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its high lipophilicity, per the Meyer-Overton correlation.

25|$|There {{is a wide}} {{variation}} in reported epidemiologic data for bruxism, and this <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> differences in the definition, diagnosis and research methodologies of these studies.
