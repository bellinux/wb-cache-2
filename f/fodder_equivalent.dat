40|$|A {{bottom-up}} approach is constructed to determine N losses from livestock farming systems and to relate these losses to {{the supply of}} fresh milk, pig and beef to Paris. First, the three products are {{expressed in terms of}} their nitrogen content; then, their <b>fodder</b> <b>equivalent</b> is determined by modelling feed formulas for swine, beef and dairy cows to meet their energy and protein requirements. Fodder deficits in livestock farms are determined by comparing the nutrient requirements of the livestock with the fodder production on the livestock farms. This allowed determining the geography of the livestock systems according to the imports of fodder to the livestock farms from external crop farms. Then we assessed the "farm-gate" N budgets in all crop and livestock farms of the entire livestock systems using data on total N fertilization, atmospheric deposition and manure management practices to finally derive N losses in relation to fodder cultivation and to manure management. Measured in N, the supply of milk, beef and pig to Paris sum 1. 85 kg N/cap and the corresponding N losses from the farming systems total 8. 9 kg N/cap. N losses per unit of product differ among the three livestock systems according to where and how the fodder is grown and to what densities the livestock is reared...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{effects of}} forage-legume intercropping on grain and <b>fodder</b> yield, land <b>equivalent</b> ratio, residual soil fertility, disease and insect pest reduction in mixed crop-livestock systems in Africa. In particular, it discusses the potential benefit of forage-legume intercropping in improving productivity, resource use efficiency and resilience {{of the system}} under climate change, which enhances {{adaptation to climate change}} and possibly provides the co-benefit of reducing greenhouse gases in sub-Saharan Africa. Research undertaken in Africa demonstrates that intercropping forage legumes with cereals improves overall yield and soil fertility, and reduces the risk of crop failure owing to rainfall variability, diseases, weeds and pests. When the forage from intercropped legumes is provided to animals it improves the digestibility of poor-quality feed, animal performance and efficiency of roughage feed utilization by ruminants. Additional role that legumes may play include lowering erosion and the loss of organic matter, reducing nitrogen leaching and carbon losses, and promoting carbon sequestration. Nitrogen fixed by legumes is safer than nitrogen from inorganic fertilizers. Despite the many benefits of forage legume intercropping the current adoption rate in sub-Saharan Africa is very low. Future research aimed at selection of compatible varieties, appropriate plant geometry and temporal arrangement of the various intercrops under different locations and management scenarios, as well as minimizing the confounding effects of water, soil, light, microclimate, and seeds could enhance adoption of the technology in Africa.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 In an {{agrisilviculture}} system, {{trees and}} crops compete for {{above and below}} ground resources. This study aimed at quantifying the effect of shoot pruning and root barriers around pollarded trees on the production of crop and tree components with and without application of fertilizer to the crop. Sorghum (1991 & 1992) and cowpea (1993 & 1994) were grown as intercrops with Lezicaena trees on a shallow red soil (alfisol) under rain fed conditions at Hyderabad, India. Crops grown with pruned trees had higher leaf area index and dry matter than did those with unpruned trees. The grain yield of sorghum was 76 % and 39 % of the pure crop yield (1553 kg ha⁻¹) with pruned and unpruned trees with no root barriers. The corresponding values for cowpea were 49 % and 26 % of the pure crop yield (1075 kg ha⁻¹). Intercropped sorghum and cowpea responded to fertilizer application more strongly than their respective pure crops, suggesting a need for fertilizer application in an agrisilvi-system. impact of root bamers was not significant on either crop. The study suggested that competition for light was stronger than for soil water. Straw and grain yield of sorghum, and dry matter yield of cowpea {{were found to be}} roughly proportional to the amount of light intercepted by the crop at harvest. Pruning of trees twice during the cropping season reduced tree diameter growth and branch and foliage yield compared to no pruning. Unpruned trees yielded 5643 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ of branches and foliage compared to 2028 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ by pruned trees. Pruning eliminated litter fall and nutrient input to the soil nutrient pool because pruned material was utilized as fodder. Unpruned trees contributed 103 kg of nitrogen and 6. 4 kg of phosphorus per hectare annually to the soil nutrient pool through litter fall. During the cropping season, soil water content was higher near the surface in tree plots compared to pure crop plots. Tree transpiration declined only after {{more than half of the}} leaf area was removed. Pruning of roots to a depth of 60 cm caused no decline in transpiration suggesting trees can draw water equally well from deeper or shallow soil layers. The study highlighted the competitive interaction between trees and crops. The agrisilvi-system produced about 50 % more biomass with unpruned trees than with pure crop or pure tree. Based on cash value (<b>fodder</b> yield <b>equivalent)</b> it would require 1. 55 times as much land if trees and crops were grown separately compared to agrisilvi-system with unpruned trees. Soil nitrogen economy and stability of fodder and fuelwood production can be achieved with pollarded-unpruned leucaena trees in an agrisilvi-system but grain crop yields are severely depressed. Thus, there was little advantage of the agrisilvi-system over pure cropping for meeting the present and increasing demand of food production. For this agrisilvi-system to be adopted by subsistence farmers in India further refinements must be developed so that crop yields are maintained...|$|R
