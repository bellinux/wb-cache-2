5|$|Akshaya: The name {{originates}} from Hindi (specifically Sanskrit) {{and signifies}} “the indomitable”. Akshaya is a female character {{with a firm}} personality, and belongs to the band although she often acts as an antepole in regard to Costello. In a certain sense she represents the matriarchal form of governance by daring to <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> alpha and making her own decisions.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} some dispute over {{the extent to which}} Kierkegaard {{influenced}} Bohr's philosophy and science. David Favrholdt argued that Kierkegaard had minimal influence over Bohr's work, taking Bohr's statement about disagreeing with Kierkegaard at face value, while Jan Faye argued that one can <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> content of a theory while accepting its general premises and structure.|$|E
50|$|Philip <b>disagrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{majority}} {{view that the}} Pleistocene epoch has ended. He claims, instead, that the Holocene is not an epoch, but actually an age within the Pleistocene. He further <b>disagrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> proposal of defining the Anthropocene as a new epoch.|$|R

5|$|Archaeological {{surveys have}} found {{evidence}} that Native Americans used the immediate vicinity of Yucca Mountain on a temporary or seasonal basis. Some Native Americans <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> conclusions of archaeological investigators that their ancestors were highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers who occupied the Yucca Mountain area before Euroamericans began using the area for prospecting, surveying, and ranching. They believe that these conclusions overlook traditional accounts of farming that occurred before European contact.|$|E
5|$|In 1934 Gandhi {{resigned}} from Congress party membership. He did not <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> party's position but {{felt that if}} he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would {{get a chance to}} make themselves heard. Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj.|$|E
5|$|Tablighi Jamaat {{encourages}} {{everyone to}} fulfill the Islamic requirement of dawah even if the person falls short of strong religious intellect. This {{was different from the}} other Islamic movements which were mainly ulama-led and extended their leadership roles to the religious scholars. Tablighi Jamaat also <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> prevailing idea that the highest standards of Islamic scholarship and ethical standards were prerequisites for proselytising, and promote dawah as a mechanism of self-reform.|$|E

5|$|Critics <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> government's {{justifications}} for introducing the GRC scheme, {{noting that the}} proportion of minority MPs per GRC has decreased with the advent of five-member and six-member GRCs. By having teams of candidates standing for election for GRCs helmed by senior politicians, the ruling People's Action Party has also used GRCs as a means for bringing first-time candidates into Parliament. Moreover, the GRC scheme is also said to disadvantage opposition parties because it is more difficult for them to find enough candidates to contest GRCs. Furthermore, it is said that the GRC scheme means that electors have unequal voting power, weakens the relationship between electors and MPs, and entrenches racialism in Singapore politics.|$|E
5|$|The Court has no {{original}} {{jurisdiction in}} most cases, {{meaning that it}} can only hear cases appealed to the Court after having been previously heard in lower courts. Most cases begin in local circuit courts, where the initial trial is held and a jury decides {{the outcome of the}} case. The circuit court decision can be appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals or the Indiana Tax Court, who can hear the case or enforce the lower court's decision. If the parties still <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> outcome of the case, they can appeal the decision to the Indiana Supreme Court. The Court can choose to hear the case and possibly overturn the previous judgment, or it can decline to accept the case and uphold the decision of the lower courts.|$|E
5|$|By noon, the Lithuanians {{received}} a reply from Moscow stating that Raštikis {{was not a}} suitable candidate for Prime Minister. The selection of another candidate would be supervised by Molotov's deputy Vladimir Dekanozov. Merkys continued to act as Prime Minister. Smetona, who continued to <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> majority of his government, {{decided to leave the}} country in protest and appointed Merkys as acting President. By late evening on June 15, Smetona and Minister of Defense Kazys Musteikis reached Kybartai and crossed the border into Germany, where they were granted temporary asylum. The Lithuanian guards did not allow them to pass; thus, Smetona had to wade across the shallow Liepona rivulet. Smetona′s departure worked to the Soviets′ advantage; its indignity opened him to ridicule {{and they were able to}} exploit the sentiments against him without fearing that he would be seen as a martyr. By fleeing, Smetona escaped the fate of Latvian President Kārlis Ulmanis and Estonian President Konstantin Päts, who were manipulated by the Soviets and later arrested. Under the Lithuanian constitution, Merkys became acting president.|$|E
