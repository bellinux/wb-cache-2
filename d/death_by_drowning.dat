5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{a catastrophic}} hazard in diving, because a seizure results in near certain <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>drowning.</b> The seizure may occur suddenly {{and with no}} warning symptoms. The effects are sudden convulsions and unconsciousness, during which victims can lose their regulator and drown. One {{of the advantages of}} a full-face diving mask is prevention of regulator loss {{in the event of a}} seizure. As there is an increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity on deep dives, long dives and dives where oxygen-rich breathing gases are used, divers are taught to calculate a maximum operating depth for oxygen-rich breathing gases, and cylinders containing such mixtures must be clearly marked with that depth.|$|E
25|$|Running {{whitewater}} rivers is {{a popular}} recreational sport but is not without danger. In fast moving water {{there is always the}} potential for injury or <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>drowning</b> or hitting objects. Fatalities do occur; some 50 people die in whitewater accidents in the United States each year.|$|E

2500|$|In {{regression}} analysis the researcher specifies an empirical model. For example, {{a very common}} model is the straight line model {{which is used to}} test if there is a linear relationship between dependent and independent variable. If a linear relationship is found to exist, the variables are said to be correlated. However, correlation does not prove causation, as both variables may be correlated with other, hidden, variables, or the dependent variable may [...] "reverse" [...] cause the independent variables, or the variables may be otherwise spuriously correlated. [...] For example, suppose there is a correlation between <b>deaths</b> <b>by</b> <b>drowning</b> and the volume of ice cream sales at a particular beach. Yet, both the number of people going swimming and the volume of ice cream sales increase as the weather gets hotter, and presumably the number of <b>deaths</b> <b>by</b> <b>drowning</b> is correlated with the number of people going swimming. Perhaps an increase in swimmers causes both the other variables to increase.|$|R
25|$|In December 1877 it was {{reported}} that whilst the schooner African Maid was undertow down the harbour, by the steamer Herald, Mrs. Wigmore, the captain's wife fell overboard, and her husband, who could not swim, then jumped after her. Captain Hall, of the steamer Herald, sprang after them and rescued both, thus making up a catalogue of 53 persons he has saved from <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>drowning.</b>|$|E

50|$|Rip {{currents}} can {{be hazardous}} {{to people in}} the water. Swimmers who are caught in a rip and who do not understand what is going on, and who may not have the necessary water skills, may panic, or exhaust themselves by trying to swim directly against the flow of water. Because of these factors, rips are the leading cause of rescues by lifeguards at beaches, and in the US rips are the cause of an average of 46 <b>deaths</b> <b>by</b> <b>drowning</b> per year.|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} known use of irrational numbers {{was in the}} Indian Sulba Sutras composed between 800 and 500BC. The first existence proofs of irrational {{numbers is}} usually attributed to Pythagoras, more specifically to the Pythagorean Hippasus of Metapontum, who produced a (most likely geometrical) proof of the irrationality of the square root of 2. The story goes that Hippasus discovered irrational numbers when trying to represent the square root of 2 as a fraction. However Pythagoras believed in the absoluteness of numbers, and could not accept the existence of irrational numbers. He could not disprove their existence through logic, {{but he could not}} accept irrational numbers, and so, allegedly and frequently reported, he sentenced Hippasus to <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>drowning,</b> to impede spreading of this disconcerting news.|$|E

25|$|Drowning {{would be}} {{considered}} as a possible cause of death when the body was recovered from a body of water, or in close proximity to a fluid which could plausibly have caused drowning, or when found with the head immersed in a fluid. A medical diagnosis of <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>drowning</b> is generally made after other possible causes of death have been excluded by means of a complete autopsy and toxicology tests. Indications of drowning are seldom completely unambiguous, and may include bloody froth in the airway, water in the stomach, cerebral oedema and petrous or mastoid haemorrhage. Some evidence of immersion may be unrelated to the cause of death, and lacerations and abrasions may have occurred before or after immersion or death.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} many ferries were {{established}} {{to help get}} across the many rivers {{on the path of}} the Oregon Trail. Multiple ferries were established on the Missouri River, Kansas River, Little Blue River, Elkhorn River, Loup River, Platte River, South Platte River, North Platte River, Laramie River, Green River, Bear River, two crossings of the Snake River, John Day River, Deschutes River, Columbia River, as well as many other smaller streams. During peak immigration periods several ferries on any given river often competed for pioneer dollars. These ferries significantly increased speed and safety for Oregon Trail travelers. They increased the cost of traveling the trail by roughly $30 per wagon but increased the speed of the transit from about 160 to 170 days in 1843 to 120 to 140 days in 1860. Ferries also helped prevent <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>drowning</b> at river crossings.|$|E

500|$|The {{difference}} between using linen, rather than leather is that linen soaks easily, and the inhabitants will drown, whereas a watertight leather sack will effect {{death by suffocation}} {{due to lack of}} air (or death by a drawn-out drowning process, relative to a comparatively quick one), rather than <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>drowning.</b> In a 1548 case from Dresden, the intention was to suffocate the culprit (who had killed his mother), rather than drown him. With him into the leather sack was a cat and a dog, and the sack was made airtight by coating it with pitch. However, the sack chosen was too small, and had been overstretched, so as the sack hit the waters after being thrown from the bridge, it ripped open. The cat and the dog managed to swim away and survive, while the criminal (presumably bound) [...] "got his punishment rather earlier than had been the intention", that is, <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>drowning</b> instead.|$|E

Records of the medico-legal autopsies in Umtata General Hospital (UGH) were reviewed from 1993 to 2004. All cases of unnatural <b>death</b> are brought <b>by</b> the police to UGH mortuary. Three hundred and forty-three cases of death {{as a result of}} drowning were recorded over a period of 12 years (1993 - 2004). There was an increased trend of drowning from 2. 7 per 100, 000 in 1993 to 12 per 100, 000 in 2004. Males outnumbered females by 2. 6 : 1. The incidence of drowning declines as age advances. The highest number (96) of victims was under ten years of age. Deaths due to drowning are increasing especially among male children and young adults...|$|R
40|$|International audienceStorm Xynthia (February 2010) was {{responsible}} for a large sea surge along theFrench Atlantic coast.

Thelocation and type of construction of the houses in the affected area contributed to the deathtoll. The fact that the inadequacy of construction with regard to coastal flood hazard couldlead to death {{was one of the}} most important lessons of the storm. The French governmentdecided to buy back and scrap the most dangerous buildings hit by Xynthia. In order toprevent future <b>deaths</b> <b>by</b> <b>drowning,</b> we have developed a tool (the V. I.
