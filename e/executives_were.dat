5|$|Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland {{were both}} under {{contract}} to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer but the studio had not put them to work in films. With their contracts coming up for renewal, feelings among studio <b>executives</b> <b>were</b> that the studio didn't need two girl singers. Every Sunday would serve as an extended screen test to decide which girl's contract would be renewed.|$|E
5|$|Over {{four years}} after Cold Feet ended, ITV <b>executives</b> <b>were</b> {{still looking for a}} series that could comfortably replace it. On his {{appointment}} as chairman of ITV plc in 2007, Michael Grade announced that he wanted the ITV network to be broadcasting long-running series like Cold Feet to attract the younger, upmarket viewing demographic.|$|E

5|$|Newman's {{great success}} at ABC had been {{noted by the}} British Broadcasting Corporation, whose <b>executives</b> <b>were</b> keen to revive their own drama department's {{fortunes}} {{in the face of}} fierce competition from ITV. In 1961 the BBC's Director of Television, Kenneth Adam, met with Newman and offered him the position of Head of Drama at the BBC. He accepted the position, eager for a new challenge, although he was forced by ABC to remain with them until the expiration of his contract in December 1962, after which he immediately began work with the BBC.|$|E
5|$|Skilling {{believed}} that if employees were constantly worried about cost, it would hinder original thinking. As a result, extravagant spending was rampant throughout the company, especially among the executives. Employees had large expense accounts and many <b>executives</b> <b>were</b> paid sometimes {{twice as much as}} competitors. In 1998, the top 200 highest-paid employees received $193 million from salaries, bonuses, and stock. Two years later, the figure jumped to $1.4 billion.|$|E
5|$|The 56th Academy Award {{nominations}} {{were announced}} about ten months after Tender Mercies was released. Little {{had been done}} to promote its candidacy: only four Oscar campaign advertisements were purchased; all of them appeared in the trade journal Variety, and Duvall had declined to campaign for himself or the film. Beresford and studio <b>executives</b> <b>were</b> surprised when the film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Harper was believed by some to be a strong contender for either Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress, but ultimately she was nominated in neither category.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} immediately put 14,528 Avro employees, as well {{as nearly}} 15,000 other employees in the Avro supply chain of outside suppliers, out of work. Declassified records show Avro management was caught unprepared by the suddenness of the announcement by the government; while <b>executives</b> <b>were</b> aware that the program was in jeopardy, they expected it to continue until the March review. It was widely believed during this lead-up to the review, the first Arrow MkII, RL-206, would be prepared for an attempt at both world speed and altitude records.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial began}} in January 2005; the judge, Mr Justice Mackay, warned {{that it could}} go on for a year. On 14 July, the judge {{instructed}} the jury to acquit all defendants on charges of manslaughter. A few days later, Balfour Beatty changed its plea to guilty on the health and safety charges and, on 6 September, Network Rail was found guilty of breaching health and safety law. Network Rail were fined £3.5 million while Balfour Beatty were fined £10 million. All of the manslaughter charges against the <b>executives</b> <b>were</b> dismissed by the judge.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, {{while writing}} for Carol, MacFarlane planned {{to develop the}} Larry shorts into a short film series for MADtv; however, the project was {{abandoned}} because the show did not possess a large enough budget to make any kind of animation. As development continued, the genre gradually shifted to a prime-time series, while the characters of Larry and Steve {{formed the basis for}} Peter and Brian, respectively. During the year, a Hanna-Barbera development executive introduced MacFarlane to alternative comedians Mike Darnell and Leslie Collins in an attempt to get Hanna-Barbera back into the prime-time business. The <b>executives</b> <b>were</b> unimpressed; a year later, MacFarlane contacted Collins at Fox; she arranged a meeting with him and the company executives to create a series based on the characters entitled Family Guy.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, five {{managers}} and two companies – Network Rail (as successors of Railtrack) and {{the division of}} Balfour Beatty that maintained the track – were charged with manslaughter and breach of health and safety charges {{in connection with the}} accident. The managers, Anthony Walker (Balfour Beatty's rail maintenance director), Nicholas Jeffries (its civil engineer), Railtrack's Alistair Cook and Sean Fugill (asset managers for the London North-East zone), and track engineer Keith Lee, all denied the charges. The corporate manslaughter charges against Network Rail/Railtrack and some of its <b>executives</b> <b>were</b> dropped in September 2004, but the other charges stood.|$|E
5|$|In December 1990, the NHL held {{a meeting}} in Palm Beach, Florida, to {{consider}} expansion applications. The NHL <b>executives</b> <b>were</b> reportedly impressed by the Ottawa presentation, including Finnigan's participation, the several hundred fans and the marching band who traveled to Palm Beach, but apparently were more impressed {{at the fact that}} the group {{was one of the few}} applicants willing to pay the $50 million franchise fee without reservations. On December 6, 1990, the Terrace group was approved to purchase one of the two franchises (along with the Tampa Bay Lightning) to start play in the 1992–93 season.|$|E
5|$|In the {{drafts of}} the Alien Resurrection screenplay, writer Joss Whedon {{included}} a death {{scene in which}} a lifeform was sucked through {{a gap in the}} hull of a ship. In the second draft, Perez was sucked through a fist-sized breach in the hull of the Auriga; this was changed in the final version to the Newborn being sucked through the window of the Betty. 20th Century Fox <b>executives</b> <b>were</b> skeptical about the final version, seeing it as a comedic scene contrasting with the overall tone of the Alien franchise, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet persuaded them to leave the scene in.|$|E

5|$|Mark Rathbun {{spent only}} {{four days in}} the Hole in 2004 but says that he left after seeing his old friend Tom De Vocht being {{physically}} beaten by Miscavige. According to Rathbun, one night the incarcerated <b>executives</b> <b>were</b> ordered to jog to a building 400 yards away and back. As they were herded back to their office-prison, he broke away and hid in bushes until the group had disappeared from sight. He retrieved his motorcycle, hid in the brush and drove out through the Gold Base gates when they were opened to let a car in. He subsequently rented a car and spent a month touring the South before settling in southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|The Veterans Committee {{election}} process was revised in July 2007. With the 2007 rules changes, the composite ballot was {{split into two}} separate ballots—one for managers and umpires {{and the other for}} executives. Also, the voting membership of the Committee, which previously included all living members of the Hall, was reduced to include just a handful of those members, plus additional executives and sportswriters. Voting for both the managers/umpires and executives ballots, which now takes place prior to inductions in even-numbered years, began with the 2008 class of inductees, when two managers and three <b>executives</b> <b>were</b> elected. To be eligible, managers and umpires must be retired for at least five years, or for at least six months if they are age 65 or older, while executives must be either retired or at least age 65.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford began {{a career}} in law, working as a court stenographer, trial lawyer and prosecutor. He became a special judge in the 14th Judicial District of Missouri at some time after 1895. He {{developed}} {{an interest in the}} doctrines of Watch Tower Society president Charles Taze Russell, which led to his joining the Bible Student movement, and he was baptized in 1906. He was appointed the legal counsel for the Watch Tower Society in 1907, as well as a traveling representative prior to his election as president in 1917. His early presidency was marked by a dispute with the Society's board of directors, in which four of its seven members accused him of autocratic behavior and sought to reduce his powers. The resulting leadership crisis divided the Bible Student community and contributed to the loss of one-seventh of adherents by 1919 and thousands more by 1931. Rutherford and seven other Watch Tower <b>executives</b> <b>were</b> imprisoned in 1918 after charges were laid over the publication of The Finished Mystery, a book deemed seditious for its opposition to World War I.|$|E

5|$|Filming began October 2000. From {{the onset}} of filming, {{difficulties}} with the studio slowed the film's development and caused a rift between the director and Universal Pictures, as <b>executives</b> <b>were</b> unhappy with the film's pacing, emphasis on small scale action sequences, and the general relationship between themselves and Liman, who was suspicious of direct studio involvement. A number of reshoots and rewrites late in development, plus scheduling problems, delayed the film from its original release target date of September 2001 to June 2002 and took it $8,000,000 over budget from the initial budget of $60 million; screenwriter Tony Gilroy faxed elements of screenplay rewrites almost throughout the entire duration of filming. A particular point of contention {{with regard to the}} original Gilroy script were the scenes set in the farmhouse near the film's conclusion. Liman and Matt Damon fought to keep the scenes in the film after they were excised in a third-act rewrite that was insisted upon by the studio. Liman and Damon argued that, though the scenes were low key, they were integral to the audience's understanding of the Bourne character and the film's central themes. The farmhouse sequence consequently went through many rewrites from its original incarnation before its inclusion in the final product.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the early 1990s productions, the mid-1990s Disney animated features presented a trend of diminishing returns. Pocahontas, released in summer 1995, was a critical and commercial disappointment compared to its predecessors, earning $346 million worldwide while still winning two Academy Awards for its music by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz. The next film, The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), partially produced at the Paris studio, performed better critically and grossed $325 million worldwide. The following summer, Hercules, grossed $252 million worldwide and received positive reviews, but it was responsible for beginning the decline of traditional animated films. The declining box office success became doubly concerning inside the studio as wage competition from DreamWorks had significantly increased the studio's overhead, with production costs increasing from $79 million in total costs (production, marketing, and overhead) for The Lion King in 1994 to $179 million for Hercules three years later. Moreover, Disney depended upon the popularity of its new features {{in order to develop}} merchandising, theme park attractions, direct-to-video sequels, and television programming in its other divisions. The production schedule was scaled back, and a larger number of creative <b>executives</b> <b>were</b> hired to more closely supervise production, a move that was not popular among the animation staff.|$|E
5|$|They {{held their}} first London gigs {{in support of}} the EP, under the advice of George and The Pooh Sticks lead singer Huw Williams. After warm up gigs in Cardiff and Birmingham, the London {{performance}} took place at the Samuel Beckett pub in Stoke Newington on 13 November 1993 alongside Anrehfn and Margi Clarke. Further Welsh radio and television appearances followed, as did an interview for NME. When George arrived for the interview, Matthews asked if he'd be interested in becoming the band's manager. He politely declined, saying that he didn't have the experience. On the 19 and 20 February 1994, the band's follow-up EP, Hooked was recorded in Llandwrog, Gwynedd, and produced by Ken Nelson who they had met on Radio Wales. A performance was set up at the Falcon the Splash Club in London where several music <b>executives</b> <b>were</b> to be present. The band drove down from Cardiff in a Ford Transit with their equipment and then spent the afternoon drinking. Just prior to going out on stage, they began taking cocaine, the result of which was a terrible performance later lamented by Roberts. The trip became a sobering experience, as they made no money from it and were only paid £50 for a gig at Kingston University a day later. Matthews later recalled that they'd needed to borrow money from a fan to pay the toll on the Severn Bridge {{on the way back to}} Cardiff.|$|E
