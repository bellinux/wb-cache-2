40|$|Although {{feedback}} on writing is researched in the disciplinary context <b>of</b> teaching <b>writing,</b> little research investigates {{feedback on}} short-form essay <b>writing.</b> The field <b>of</b> instructional design is also lacking {{in research on}} feedback in the teaching <b>of</b> <b>writing.</b> However, {{research in the field}} of multimedia learning including the personalization principle (Mayer, 2001) would seem to support providing conversational audio as an alternative to providing written corrective feedback to students who are engaged in the writing process. Even though the field of Rhetoric and Composition and Instructional Design does not offer much research on feedback on short-form writing, the most substantial research base comes from the field of English as a Second Language (ESL). The {{purpose of this study was}} two-fold. Firstly, the study explored pre-medical students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions, and achievement on the types of feedback received on their writing assignments. Secondly, the study examined the types of feedback an instructor is more likely to give in the <b>different</b> <b>formats</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>written</b> versus audio screencast formats. The participants for this study included 1 instructor, who was a subject of analysis, and 31 pre-medical students at a Midwestern university. The study was categorized into three strands. Strand 1 utilized a survey design, Strand 2 utilized a repeated-measure design, and Strand 3 utilized a content analysis design to address the research questions. In Strand 1, the open-ended questions revealed that students liked the feedback via audio screencast as being more personal, but also found written corrective feedback more specific. In addition, a combined feedback approach was evident from the closed-ended questions. In Strand 2, data analysis revealed statistically significant increase in all the students 2 ̆ 7 essay scores except for assignments 1 and 5, in which the traditional written format was utilized. In Strand 3, data analysis revealed that a significantly more direct and indirect corrective feedback comments were given by the instructor on essays when utilizing the traditional written feedback format compared to when feedback via audio screencast was used. Data analysis also revealed that the instructor had a substantially higher usage of rhetorical and social supportive feedback when providing feedback via audio screencast as opposed to the traditional written feedback format. The study contributes to the existing body of literature on audio feedback and written feedback on writing assignments in ESL, and serves as a foundation for writing teachers who are interested in writing in general and feedback on writing assignments. The study suggests that instructional designers can use the findings of this study to guide and inform their decisions about innovative approaches to providing feedback on students writing, which is a vehicle for critical thinking, and synthesis in many content areas...|$|R

The study was conducted in Greece with the participation of first year upper secondary public school pupils (Lykeio, Grade 10, age 15 - 16). The correlations between the <b>different</b> <b>formats</b> <b>of</b> assessment tended to be between 0. 30 and 0. 71. This is a wide range but even the highest value is well short of 1. 0. This suggests that the best student found by one method is not necessarily the best student by another method.

40|$|AbstractThe study {{reported}} in this paper investigates the effect of navigational mechanisms on students in a computer based assessment environment at a cross-cultural setting. Literatures in computer based assessment studies highlight the phenomenon of “test mode effect” that can explain the differences in test scores across two <b>different</b> <b>formats</b> <b>of</b> testing. In this study the authors posit that even <b>different</b> <b>formats</b> <b>of</b> presentation through the same media might affect students’ performance in a computer based assessment environment. The {{study reported}} here investigates the effect of two different navigational mechanisms namely, vertical menu and step based navigations on students’ performance. Students from Indian universities and American universities participated in the study. The results highlight that navigational mechanisms affect students’ performance and their subjective evaluation of the Computer based Assessment system. The {{results of the study}} would provide navigational heuristics for the Graphical User Interface designers to design a learner centered Computer based Assessment system...|$|R
40|$|Decision {{situations}} have various aspects: {{knowledge acquisition}} and structuring, knowledge representation, knowledge validation and decision making. It {{has been recognized}} in literature that decision tables {{can play an important}} role in each of these stages. It is however not necessary to use only one representation formalism during the whole life cycle of an intelligent system. Likewise it is possible that <b>different</b> <b>formats</b> <b>of</b> the same formalism serve different purposes in the development process. Important in this respect is the search for automated and, if possible, optimized transitions between <b>different</b> <b>formats</b> <b>of</b> a formalism and between various formalisms. In this paper a branch and bound algorithm is presented that transforms expanded decision tables, that, because of their explicit enumeration of all decision cases primarily serve an acquisition and verification function, into optimized contracted decision tables, primarily used as target representation of a decision process. An optimal contracted decision table is a contracted decision table with a condition order which results in the minimum number of contracted decision columns. ...|$|R
