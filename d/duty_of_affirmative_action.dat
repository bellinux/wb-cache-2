5000|$|Several {{different}} studies {{investigated the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> on women. Kurtulus (2012) in her review <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> and the occupational advancement of {{minorities and women}} during 1973-2003 showed that the effect <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> on advancing black, Hispanic, and white women into management, professional, and technical occupations occurred primarily during the 1970s and early 1980s. During this period, contractors grew their shares of these groups more rapidly than noncontractors because of the implementation <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action.</b> But the positive effect <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> vanished entirely in the late 1980s, which Kurtulus says {{may be due to}} the slowdown into advanced occupation for women and minorities because of the political shift <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> that started by President Reagan. Becoming a federal contractor increased white women's share of professional occupations by 0.183 percentage points, or 7.3 percent, on average during these three decades, and increased black women's share by 0.052 percentage points (or by 3.9 percent). Becoming a federal contractor also increased Hispanic women's and black men's share of technical occupations on average by 0.058 percent and 0.109 percentage points respectively (or by 7.7 and 4.2 percent). These represent a substantial contribution <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> to overall trends in the occupational advancement of women and minorities over the three decades under the study.

40|$|Four {{experiments}} investigated if beneficiaries <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> experience stereotype {{threat and}} its negative consequences. Study one consisted {{of an experiment}} in which we simulated <b>affirmative</b> native <b>action</b> procedures. We found that <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> programs which do not ensure beneficiaries of their equality of merit and ability, can induce stereotype threat and its negative consequences. However we recognised that the previous <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> manipulations may not match the forms <b>of</b> <b>Affirmative</b> <b>action</b> utilized in Northern Ireland. Therefore study two used a more applicable "weak" preferential selection manipulation. We found that this found <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> did not induce stereotype threat nor its negative consequences as these participants knew the stereotype <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> was not true of themselves. However the stereotype threat hypothesis postulates that stereotype endorsement {{is not necessary to}} induce stereotype threat. Study three empirically tested this assumption. We manipulated both the presentation of a stereotype, and participants' personal endorsement of that stereotype. We found that the inducement of stereotype threat does not in fact require stereotype endorsement. This finding leads us to ask why <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> in study two did not induce stereotype threat. We hypothesised that these participants simply were not aware {{they were part of a}} stereotyped group. Therefore in study four we presented beneficiaries of weak preferential selection manipulations with the widespread stereotype surrounding <b>affirmative</b> <b>action.</b> We found that when beneficiaries <b>of</b> weak <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> procedures encounter the negative stereotype associated with <b>affirmative</b> <b>action,</b> stereotype threat is induced. The present research contributes to the previous literature by moving the argument on from the forms <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> used, to how public discourses and presentations <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> may be the true cause for concern. Moreover this thesis also contributes to the stereotype threat literature by empirically that stereotype threat does not depend on stereotype endorsement.

The overall {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the nature <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action,</b> the implications <b>of</b> the implementation <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> and the role of the social worker, using the strength approach in empowering person, families and communities who are affected by the implementation <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action.</b> Section A includes the problem statement, the objectives of the research, the methodology and the compilation of the research document. The problem statement is as follows: • The implementation <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> is a reality and a sensitive subject. Employees are affected by the implementation <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> in either a positive of a negative way. For the employee who is negatively affected if brings about that certain changes have to take place with implications for the person, the family and the community. • Many people cannot adjust and problems are experienced which has a negative influence on their social well being. • The persons experience a crisis and the role of the social worker is not clear regarding the empowerment of these people to be empowered through the strength approach to accept the challenge and the overcome the situation. The problem statement lead to the research and the objectives are to assess the attitude of persons being affected by <b>affirmative</b> <b>action,</b> the experience <b>of</b> persons being affected by <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> and the challenges facing the persons who are affected by the implementation <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action.</b> Section B consists of three articles that form the research document. Each article reports on a certain aspect of the problem statement and the objectives that were formulated. The three articles are the following: Article 1 : The nature, purpose and implications <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> This article includes a short history on the development of discrimination in South Africa and legislation that lead to the implementation <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action.</b> The article also includes the process of the implementation <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> and the negative and positive implications of the implementation <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action.</b> Article 2 : The implications <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> for the person, the family and the community In this article the focus is on persons and their families who are unemployed due to the implementation <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action.</b> In order to understand the implications it is important to understand what it means to be employed and to be able to provide in you own needs and in the needs of your family. The importance of being employed is also emphasized in certain theories which is briefly discussed and made applicable on the research. The implications for the community is also discussed especially regards to values and norms. Article 3 : The role of the social worker in empowering persons who are unemployed due to <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> In the article emphasis is placed on the crisis that these persons experience and the role of the social worker by using the strength approach to empower persons to overcome the crisis, to overcome the changes and to be empowered to live a full life.

40|$|<b>Affirmative</b> <b>action</b> {{addresses}} {{the phenomenon of}} historical and present disadvantage for groups including racial minorities and women within societies around the world. The thesis interrogates the concept <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> in employment in three jurisdictions: the United States, Canada and Australia. It focuses on how these countries construct, measure and determine limits for specific <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> programs at the workplace. The thesis begins with a critical investigation of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action,</b> followed by an analysis of its theoretical justification by various scholars. International guidelines of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) and Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) are considered for the national implementation <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> in the comparator countries. The thesis outlines <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> in the three key jurisdictions noting differences in their approach to implementation. These analyses lead {{to the conclusion that}} there are two types <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action,</b> <b>of</b> which the first addresses equality of opportunity and the second equality of outcome. Both types <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> require different methods of implementation. Whilst the first type is more effective through the application of pro-active permanent strategies, the second type should be based on specific targets and temporal limits, which need to be reassessed after their deadlines have been reached. At this point, either the latter type <b>of</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> should be ended or readjusted {{to meet the challenges of}} multi-cultural societies today. It is concluded that <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> is theoretically justifiable and has an important role in the achievement of equal opportunities and equality of outcome. However, its justification is reliant on it being appropriately limited in time or limited to the achievement of specific outcomes. The thesis ends by offering an analysis of the different ways <b>of</b> limiting <b>affirmative</b> <b>action,</b> and suggests what limits are most appropriate and effective. Thesis (Ph. D.)
