40|$|It {{has been}} a common {{practice}} both in Sweden and worldwide to enclose nuclear reactors with prestressed concrete structures. The prestress level decreases with time from its initial value due to various degradation mechanisms. To ensure that the prestress level is sufficient the tendon force is measured at regular <b>in-service</b> <b>inspections.</b> The intention with {{this paper is to}} present a reliability-based procedure to evaluate the prestress level on the basis of data from <b>in-service</b> <b>inspections.</b> Existing approaches to evaluate the prestress level do {{not take into account the}} variability in the measured prestress. It is not possible to achieve a complete assurance concerning the prestress level. However, by using a probabilistic model, involving the variability in the measuring result and the structural behaviour, the prestress level could be confirmed in a more stringent way. Both the time dependent loss of prestress and the possibility of tendons being broken (due to defects as corrosion) are considered. To avoid through-wall cracks in the concrete it is required that the prestress shall counterbalances the tensile stresses expected at an internal accident. The factor of interest is the prestress level in the concrete and not the force in individual tendons. Several tendons influence the prestress level in a specific part of the containment. The required prestress level shall be fulfilled in all parts of the containment where each part is influenced by a number of individual tendons. It is suggested in this paper that this problem can be analysed as a structural reliability problem idealized as a series of correlated parallel subsystems. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The most {{critical}} safety barrier {{in a nuclear}} power plant, the concrete containment, is prestressed by hundreds of tendons, both horizontally and vertically. The main purpose of the containment is to prevent radioactive discharge to the environment {{in the case of}} a serious internal accident. Due to creep and shrinkage of concrete and relaxation of the prestressing steel, tendon forces decrease with time. These forces are thus measured in Swedish containments with unbonded tendons at regular <b>in-service</b> <b>inspections.</b> In this paper, the prestress losses obtained from these <b>in-service</b> <b>inspections</b> are compared to losses estimated using several prediction models for creep, shrinkage and relaxation. In an attempt to increase the accuracy of these models, existing expressions for the development of shrinkage were modified using previous findings on the humidity and temperature inside two Swedish containments. The models which were used and modified for predicting creep and shrinkage were CEB-FIP Model Codes 1990 and 1999, ACI 209, Model B 3 and GL 2000. Eurocode 2 was used for the prediction of relaxation. The results show that the most accurate of the models were CEB/FIP MC 99 and ACI 209. Depending on the model, the accuracy of the prediction models was increased by 0. 5 - 1. 2 percentage points of prestress losses when using the modified development of shrinkage. Furthermore, it was found that the differences between the different models depend mainly on the prediction of creep. Possible explanations for the deviation between the calculated and measured models can be the influence of reinforcement on creep and shrinkage of concrete and the influence of friction on horizontal tendons...|$|R

50|$|Professor Balankin {{has done}} {{pioneering}} work in fractal solid mechanics, probabilistic fracture mechanics, and fluid flow through porous media. Specifically, {{he has developed}} the probabilistic mechanics of self-affine cracks, a new theory which permits one to increment the reliability of probabilistic fracture mechanics analysis. Balankin also has introduced the new concept of multifractal elasticity and has developed the theory of mechanical behaviour and fracture of composites with multifractal structures. In 1996, {{the development of new}} composite materials with multifractal microstructure, supervised by Professor Balankin, was recognized with the First Place Romulo Garza Prize for Research and Technological Development in Mexico in 1996. Further, he has discovered new important general features in dynamics of self-affine interfaces growing far from equilibrium: a new type of unconventional anomalous roughening dynamics of flame fronts in heterogeneous media, self-affine fluctuations of growing interface width, non-universal nature of interface roughness dynamics in systems with long-range spatial and temporal correlations, a new statistical distribution function for interface roughness statistics, relationships between structural, mechanical, and dynamical properties of an elastic fractal networks, fractal kinetics of self-organization of dissipative structures in the process of mechanical alloying in attritors, fractal morphology of sol-gels materials, fractal scattering of radar microwaves from soils. He has also suggested some modifications to the fracture toughness testing standards, concerning the effect of fractal crack roughness and has proposed a new criterion for crack initiation - the fractal fracture toughness, the revolutionary concept which is actually used in the probabilistic integrity assessment of oil pipelines. From 2001, Professor Balankin has also been involved in an ambitious project of fractal study of soils, which is expected to introduce revolutionary changes in the agriculture technology that will provide great benefits to Mexico and to developing countries. The works in this field have received a great international projection (see Physical Review Focus,). More recently, Professor Balankin has developed a novel dynamic scaling approach to study and forecast time series fluctuations. This finding permits us to use the powerful tools of kinetic roughening theory to classify, model, and forecast the fluctuations of real-world time series. In particular, dynamic scaling approach was used in the Econophysics studies performed by the Fractal Mechanics group, in which it was discovered some important features in the oil market behaviour that permit the better forecasting of crude oil prices. The last wok was awarded in 2004 with the National Prize in Financial Research. At the same time, Professor Balankin actively pursued research opportunities in engineering probabilistic fracture mechanics. Besides, he has made a principal contribution {{to the development of a}} new risk based maintenance program for nuclear reactor vessel of the Laguna Verde nuclear power plant. The cost-benefit analysis of the suggested risk-based inspection program has shown that this program represents a substantial saving in cost and reduces the radiation exposure during the nuclear plant operation. It is important to mention, the risk-informed <b>in-service</b> <b>inspection</b> program increases vessel safety, because it focuses on any potential additional examinations on those areas which are most likely to experience the probable failure conditions. This work was recognized as the best research project in applied sciences in 2001 and has been honoured with the First Place Prize for the Research in 2001 by the National Polytechnic Institute. More recently, Professor Balankin has developed a new methodology of probabilistic reliability assignment of cable-stayed bridges, actually used by the Mexican Transport Institute. He has also developed the methodology and software for probabilistic evaluation of oil pipelines. The proposed risk-based pipeline assessment procedure is more reliable to account for huge amount of collected data usually obtained in in-service inspections using the intelligent devices. The outcomes of developed risk-based methodology are very useful in the decision-making process by the operation management. Now, this methodology is used by the (PEMEX) and saves the Mexican Government millions of dollars each year by preventing pipeline accidents. Another of his technological contributions is the development of models and simulators of new revolutionary methods of oil extraction from naturally fractured reservoirs which will permit the increment the crude extraction from such reservoirs up to 100%.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years, {{composite}} material usage in primary aircraft structures has increased dramatically. Providing high strength, stiffness, and weight savings, these structures are often large and complex in shape, and usually flight critical. Fighter aircraft manufacturing requires 100 % inspection of all flight critical parts prior to installation. Periodic <b>in-service</b> <b>inspections</b> of some components may be necessary {{for the life of}} the vehicle. Automated ultrasonic systems, using piezoelectric transducers and mechanical scanners, have been used by the aerospace industry for inspecting flat or mildly contoured composite parts in the production environment. These conventional systems are typically slow, require significant setup time for highly contoured parts, and are generally inappropriate for <b>in-service</b> <b>inspections</b> where access is limited to a single side. In view of the increasing usage of composite parts in fighter aircraft, conventional ultrasonic inspection systems will not be able to meet the demanding NDI needs in the production and in-service testing of next-generation fighter aircraft. The laser ultrasonic testing (Laser UT) method, which has been shown to have many advantages over conventional UT systems, can meet these challenging needs [1]. The advantages of Laser UT are: (1) the method is non-contact, requiring no couplants, (2) it can rapidly scan large areas, (3) it is able to inspect at angles far off normal, (4) it does not require expensive part fixtures, and (5) prior knowledge of the surface contour is not required. Laser UT can significantly reduce the time and cost of inspecting complex contoured composite parts by reducing or eliminating part fixtures and long setup times. Furthermore, by using optical scanning techniques, Laser UT is capable of testing complex contoured composite structures at speeds that can not be matched by conventional mechanical scanning systems...|$|R
