The industrialist's son, Red, has found two strange animals, and he enlists Slim in a plan to turn the animals into a circus act. The astronomer, meanwhile, tells the industrialist {{that he has been}} in contact with space aliens who want to open up their world to interstellar trade. Their <b>world</b> <b>needs</b> <b>help,</b> the astronomer says; for ever since the atomic wars that destroyed their old civilization, their world has been regressing. Unless something is done, their culture may face total collapse.|$|R

This relatively recent stereotype spawned from Cold War and post-Cold War military interventions such as the Vietnam War and Iraq War, which many people opposed.|$|R

5000|$|Superior Spider-Man {{battles with}} Spider-Woman and Spider-Girl stating that by {{destroying}} the Web, he's giving them free will. Anya sees totemic script on the dagger, Superior Spider-Man attempts to stab her before being punched away by Spider-Man. Superior Spider-Man sneers that Spider-Man is a coward for ganging up on him, but Spider-Man {{points out that}} {{he did the same}} thing as the founder of the Sinister Six. Taking advantage of the distraction, Spider-Girl immobilizes Superior Spider-Man's arm and reads that {{there will always be a}} Master Weaver at the center of the Great Web. Silk recalls that the Inheritors referred to her as the [...] "Spinner at the center of the Web" [...] and wonders if her destiny is to take the Master Weaver's place. While Superior Spider-Man again tries to stab Spider-Girl, he snaps that <b>his</b> <b>world</b> <b>needs</b> him and that he's the greatest Spider-Man ever. Spider-Man and Spider-Woman knock him back, and Spider-Girl secures the dagger reading that anyone can take the place of the current Master Weaver, but only death can free the Master Weaver from their sacred obligation. Silk, having spent most of her life trapped in one room, balks at the idea of spending the rest of eternity trapped again and Karn commiserates with her.|$|R

Appel {{has argued}} that [...] "treating human beings differently, simply because they were born on the {{opposite}} side of a national boundary," [...] is inherently unethical.

Economist and writer Philippe Legrain argues that the countries of the <b>world</b> <b>need</b> migration to <b>help</b> global trade and reduce the occurrence of regional wars.|$|R

40|$|Veterinary {{education}} must {{adapt to the}} changing demands that veterinary medicine is obligated to meet as it serves {{the needs of the}} ever-increasing global society. The <b>world</b> community <b>needs</b> the <b>help</b> of veterinary professionals to produce sufficient amounts of safe food, to control and eradicate the increasingly frequent transboundary transmission of disease, and to improve the health of both man and animals, at a global level as well as locally. In recognition of these mounting responsibilities, especially in the need for veterinarians in rural practice, one key venture in Australia has been the creation of the new veterinary school in Wagga Wagga.

40|$|As {{we shall}} be {{thinking}} of it here, to engage in representational explanation is to explain behaviour by invoking internal states with content (i. e. internal states that encode meaning or bear information). Thus one may account for why Voldemort triumphantly parades Harry's limp body {{in front of the}} assembled fighters at Hogwarts by explaining that Voldemort possesses a behaviour-influencing inner state that bears the (as it happens) inaccurate content, 'Harry is dead'. Here, then, is how things look to the representationalist. Intelligent agents take the world to be a certain way. One animal may represent a second animal as a potential dinner, while the second may represent the first as a threat. Of course, as Voldemort discovered to <b>his</b> detriment, the <b>world</b> <b>need</b> not be the way agents take it to be. Philosophers often develop this thought by saying that where we encounter an agent that is genuinely capable of representing the world, there already exists the possibility of that agent misrepresenting the world...|$|R

Over the phone, Dr. Kroger reprimands Natalie for her refusal to help Monk with these homicides. Natalie insists that {{she just wants to}} have a vacation, but Dr. Kroger points out that what she is using is {{something}} called emotional blackmail - essentially, she is attempting to make Monk someone he is not. Monk's detective abilities are what help him identify himself in the <b>world.</b> <b>His</b> <b>need</b> to detect is not something that Natalie {{is going to be able}} to change. She can't blame Monk for being the person he always has been. She'll have to find some form of a compromise between them or they'll both have a very long day.|$|R

40|$|Throughout {{the history}} of {{education}} {{there have been several}} attempts to innovate and improve the methodologies to improve the teaching and learning process. Those changes have had a minimal, but important advance because the positivist- knowledge centred view that had been pervading education during many years has now been superseded by a person centred paradigm which establishes that {{the most important part of}} any educational process is the student. Even so, there must be an important consideration to prepare students in order to be able to deal with the demand of qualification needed to perform a task and obtain a job. It is therefore a big task for teachers not only to prepare students for having an acceptable performance in their jobs, but also to form competitive persons whose personality can lead them to higher levels of competence and adaptation. The role of a teacher is not just to make the students focus on developing their knowledge of the <b>world.</b> Teachers <b>need</b> to <b>help</b> students develop their skills in order to master them in different contexts in the target language. In other words, the way students perform in class in terms of oral active participation might be fundamental to create a participation culture which may enable them to perform in other areas of their personal and professional life...|$|R
