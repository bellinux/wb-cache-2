500|$|The Enterprise brings {{aboard the}} Betazoid Federation {{emissary}} Tam Elbrun (Harry Groener), and takes {{him to a}} distant star system. Elbrun, whom Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) previously <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was a mental patient, {{has a history of}} mental instability due to his overpoweringly strong telepathic capabilities, but his unique skills are used for first contact situations with alien life. On this particular mission, Elbrun's abilities are needed to try to coax a giant sentient spaceship, code named [...] "Tin Man," [...] away from a star that is about to go supernova. It also comes to light that the star is in a Romulan-claimed area of space, and that this is a race to claim the ship. [...] Elbrun finds it impossible to filter out the thoughts of the Enterprise crew, but finds solace in meeting Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), who Elbrun is initially puzzled by finding what he calls 'absence of mind'; he finds relief in developing a friendship with Data, who, being an artificial lifeform, has no organic mind to be read.|$|E

500|$|As a commander, General Nansouty is {{reported}} to have been a man of spirit but also to have had an excessive inclination towards sarcasm, which was damaging to his reputation and made him a number of enemies. His few months spent in Spain in 1808, where he commanded the orderly officers of the Emperor and the aides-de-camp of the senior generals of the General Staff, seem to have acquired him an unwanted reputation for mockery on the service, to such a point that one of his subordinates reported that [...] "no one ever <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was joking and when he was serious." [...] When it came to military matters though, Nansouty's posture became extremely imposing, concise and tough. A perfectionist, with a keen eye and impeccable knowledge of his arm, he was shocked whenever he saw his cavalry manoeuvres mishandled and then he became sarcastic, at times even insulting his subordinates. However, whenever he went too far with his reprimands, he was noticeably displeased with himself and remorseful, trying to offer reparation to the person he had insulted. This behaviour seems to have been recurrent. His mood seems to have been particularly bad during his last days of service, in 1814, after he had received a number of light wounds {{in a short period of}} time, and foremost, after he had fallen out with the Emperor. During this period, he severely mistreated one of his squadron commanders for not executing his order fast enough, and even sacked his chief of staff, Colonel de la Loyère, for a minor fault.|$|E
500|$|Michael Lydon, {{another of}} Charles' biographers, {{summarized}} {{the impact of}} the song: [...] "'What'd I Say' was a monster with footprints bigger than its numbers. Daringly different, wildly sexy, and fabulously danceable, the record riveted listeners. When 'What'd I Say' came on the radio, some turned it off in disgust, but millions turned the volume up to blasting and sang 'Unnnh, unnnh, oooooh, oooooh' along with Ray and the Raelets. [...] became the life of a million parties, the spark of as many romances, and a song to date the Summer by." [...] The song's impact was not immediately seen in the U.S.; it was particularly popular in Europe. Paul McCartney was immediately struck by the song and <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> heard it {{that he wanted to be}} involved in making music. George Harrison remembered an all-night party he attended in 1959 where the song was played for eight hours non-stop: [...] "It was one of the best records I ever heard." [...] While the Beatles were developing their sound in Hamburg, they played [...] "What'd I Say" [...] at every show, trying to see how long they could make the song last and using the audience in the call and response, with which they found immense popularity. The opening electric piano in the song was the first John Lennon had ever heard, and he tried to replicate it with his guitar. Lennon later credited Charles' opening of [...] "What'd I Say" [...] to the birth of songs dominated by guitar riffs.|$|E
500|$|Over 13 {{seasons with}} the White Sox, Pierce was the ace of the {{pitching}} staff, leading the team in wins nine times and in strikeouts eight times. He was Chicago's Opening Day starter seven times (1951–52, 1954, 1956–59), and started the home opener in 1953 and 1961. He had an outstanding fastball and an excellent curveball, and in 1951 added the slider (for which he used his motion for the curve rather than the fastball) as a third strong pitch, {{as well as a}} changeup. He worked quickly with an over-the-top motion, dropping his back shoulder in a style similar to that later used by Sandy Koufax. In 1957, Paul Richards noted of Pierce's early style: [...] "He had a tendency to windmill in his delivery, which makes the ball spin too much and takes the life out of it. He flashed his curve-the Yankees always <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was throwing a curve. But mainly Bill didn't want to throw anything but fast balls in the old days. He laughed at the change-of-pace and the slider, so most of the strong right-hand hitters were laying back for him, waiting for a fast ball down the middle." [...] After Pierce finally tried the slider against the Yankees, to great effect, Richards noted, [...] "Then, for a while there, he began throwing nothing but sliders. He finally learned about that, too. Even today Pierce will pitch a whole ball game and almost never throw anything but fast balls. But only on certain days." [...] Yankees star Joe DiMaggio was among those praising Pierce's ability, reportedly remarking, [...] "That little so-and-so is a marvel. So little – and all that speed. And I mean speed! He got me out of there on a fastball in the ninth that I'd have needed a telescope to see." [...] Richards became Chicago's manager in 1951, and worked with Pierce to develop his two new pitches and slow down his pace, as well as significantly improve his control; Pierce later recalled, [...] "I learned to control my fastball better [...] Developing the slider helped me tremendously because it gave me a third out pitch. I threw it almost as hard as my fastball, but I could throw it for strikes better than the fast ball or good curve ... Richards made me work on it, and it took me about two years before it was consistent." [...] After issuing 249 walks in 391 innings in 1949–1950, Pierce gave up only 73 walks in 240 innings in 1951, and averaged more than 3 walks per 9 innings in three seasons afterward. His 1951 ERA of 3.03 was fourth best in the league, and he ranked sixth in 1952 with a mark of 2.57. On September 21, 1952 he broke Doc White's 1907 club record of 141 strikeouts by a left-hander, ending the season with 144.|$|E

2500|$|.....I {{had a lot}} of {{time for}} Norling as an {{international}} referee. The Welshman and New Zealander David Bishop would be the best I've seen during my years of Test match rugby. And the common factor linking Norling and Bishop was that both played the advantage rule very well, they had a real empathy for the game and its players, and they seemed to enjoy letting the game flow. Rarely could either official be accused of whistling for a stoppage prematurely... Norling was also one of the more flamboyant referees. The crowd always <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was out there. At the same time, he was a top drawer referee and perhaps could get away with a bit of the showmanship because his decisions were generally spot-on.|$|E

2500|$|The filmmakers' {{decision}} to leave Shelob for the third film meant that Faramir had to become an obstacle for Frodo and Sam. In the book, Faramir (like Aragorn) quickly recognizes the Ring as a danger and a temptation, and does not hesitate long before letting Frodo and Sam go. In the film, Faramir first decides that the Ring shall go to Gondor and his father Denethor, {{as a way to}} prove his worth. In the film, Faramir takes Frodo, Sam and the Ring to the Battle of Osgiliath— they do not go there in the book. Jackson winks to readers with Sam's line, [...] "By all rights we shouldn't even be here, but we are." [...] After seeing how strongly the Ring affects Frodo during the Nazgûl attack, Faramir changes his mind and lets them go. These changes reshape the book's contrast between Faramir and Boromir, who in The Fellowship of the Ring attempted to take the Ring for himself. On the other hand, (which can be seen only in the film's extended version), it is actually their father who wants the Ring and urges Boromir to get it, while Faramir only wants to prove himself to his father. Boyens contends these plot changes were needed to keep the Ring menacing. Wenham commented on the DVD documentaries that he had not read the book prior to reading the script, so the film's version of Faramir was the Faramir he <b>knew.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> later read the book and noticed the major difference, he approached the writers about it, and they explained to him that if he did say [...] "I wouldn't pick that thing up even if it lay by the wayside", it would basically strip the One Ring of all corruptive power.|$|E
