30|$|What makes FFI a {{promising}} endeavor {{in foreign language}} teaching is its potential to <b>draw</b> the <b>learner’s</b> <b>attention</b> to recurring forms during the lesson, hence attending to both form and communicative meaning (Long, 1991, 2000). Unlike the Grammar-Translation Approach, which divides language into discrete segments with no regard to meaning, the FFI lesson responds to learners’ needs (Long, 1991), as communicative tasks and meaningful practice blend in activities which <b>draw</b> the <b>learner’s</b> <b>attention</b> to language forms (Schmidt’s (1990) consciousness-raising by noticing) to promote fluency and accuracy alike (Fotos & Nassaji, 2011).|$|R

30|$|For future {{teachers}} like Yolanda, Betty, and Laura, {{it might also}} be necessary to be explicit about making meaning across modalities. A critical aspect of scaffolding understanding is <b>drawing</b> a <b>learner's</b> <b>attention</b> to aspects of how meaning is constructed in specialized discourse; in this case, {{to the ways in which}} mathematical knowledge is constructed ([Schleppegrell, 2007, Lemke, 2003, O'Halloran, 2005]). In the classroom, visual and symbolic representations, which were ever present, were explicitly discussed only when a student made an error, such as when students represented a fraction visually and the fractions were of different sizes or when the equal sign was used as a placeholder rather than to mean both sides are equal. Thus, the importance of making meaning through multiple modalities might be, in some cases, a hidden aspect of preparing {{future teachers}}.|$|R
40|$|The current project {{contributes}} to the {{growing body of research}} in second language acquisition that investigates the facilitative effects of <b>drawing</b> <b>learner</b> <b>attention</b> to problematic aspects of linguistic input through input enhancement. Specifically, the research examines the extent to which input enhancement (Sharwood Smith 1991, 1993) via typographically altered texts facilitates the acquisition of third person dative and accusative clitic pronouns in Spanish for university level native English speakers enrolled in both beginner and advanced levels of Spanish second language courses. A number of past studies have indicated that all verbal clitics have been an obstacle in gaining L 2 Spanish proficiency. Prior research has indicated that the most difficult pronominal system for L 1 English speakers learning L 2 Spanish are the third person dative and accusative clitic pronouns (VanPatten 1984). These students also tend to misinterpret preverbal clitics as subjects (VanPatten 1984). The significance of the project is twofold. First, it will consider whether input enhancement used to facilitate the identification of referents of anaphoric pronouns aides in the acquisition of the pronouns. Secondly, it examines at which level, beginner or advanced, input enhancement could be most beneficial for the L 2 Spanish student. It also takes into account local comprehension, whereas prior input enhancement studies have investigated global comprehension. Furthermore, the results may have a direct impact on future computer technology that could be developed for foreign language instruction as it investigates the effects of this external attention drawing device in a Computer Assisted Language Learning setting. Results of the investigation indicated that input enhancement at the advanced level was successful in aiding L 2 Spanish students to comprehend anaphora resolution with third person dative and accusative clitic pronouns in Spanish...|$|R

Scaffolding is different from supports such as job aids in that scaffolds may both simplify processes and highlight certain aspects of their complexity (Reiser 2004); these functions are based upon what barriers learners often face for that task or learning outcome.|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} hypothetical would-clauses {{presented in}} Korean high school English textbooks from two perspectives: real language use and Focus on Form approach. Initiated by {{an interest in}} the results of a corpus study, this study discussed hypothetical would-clauses in terms of how their descriptions in Korean EFL textbooks matched real language use. This study additionally investigated whether the textbooks presented the target language features in ways recommended by the Focus on Form approach. In the past few decades, authentic language use and the Focus on Form approach have received a great amount of attention in the SLA field. Recognizing the trend in SLA as well as necessities in Korean EFL education, the Korean government has incorporated these two into the current 7 th curriculum. Such condition provided the momentum for the evaluation of the textbooks in these respects. The findings show that the language features were hardly supplemented by the information drawn from real language data. In addition, there were very few attempts to <b>draw</b> <b>learner</b> <b>attention</b> to language forms while keeping them focused on communication as recommended by Focus on Form approach. With increasing use of the English language, it is becoming more necessary for Korean EFL learners to use English in real life contexts where understanding correct nuances and delivering appropriate expressions may be important. Also, in EFL contexts like Korea, the students may have limited access to the target language input and little opportunities to produce outputs in extracurricular settings, so the integrated methodology of Focus on Form approach, rather than just using either one of structure-centered or meaning-oriented approach, would be of greater benefit to the students. However, the results strongly indicate that the textbooks neither incorporate the language features as they occur in naturally occurring language nor present them as to facilitate the learning of both form and meaning. This study suggests that greater use of real language data and more thorough application of Focus on Form methods in the textbook writing process should be seriously considered. Thus, this study could be useful for curriculum developers and textbook writers in creating curriculum and language materials concerning the incorporation of grammar patterns based on actual language use as well as in improving textbooks with respect to the Focus on Form approach...|$|R
30|$|All {{of these}} {{examples}} of disciplinary learning show that gesture, and arguably embodied actions more broadly, {{may serve as}} a useful resource in improving spatial thinking precisely because it serves to ground understanding of spatial concepts in bodily action. In fact, as a manifestation of the embodied mind (Alibali, 2005; Hostetter & Alibali, 2008), gesture has been argued to enhance thought by foregrounding action in mental representation (Goldin-Meadow & Beilock, 2010). As argued previously, spatial thought may regularly be grounded in the simulation of perception and action states as a means to structure information and draw inferences: mental representations of space maintain analog features of the external world (Kosslyn et al., 1978) and mental imagistic processes such as mental rotation interface with the body’s motor system (Chu & Kita, 2008; Waller, 2014; Wexler et al., 1998). Compellingly, the imagery and computation underlying spatial thinking can be selectively enhanced through instruction employing embodied actions. For example, when presented with the classic “radiation problem” (Gick & Holyoak, 1980) that involves deciding how to irradiate a tumor without killing a patient, Craig, Nersessian, and Catrambone (2002) demonstrated that participants who were asked to make gestures that described their solution strategy performed much better than participants who only made a drawing of their solution strategy. Studies such as these demonstrate that gesture may have a unique role for supporting spatial thinking that goes beyond <b>drawing</b> a <b>learner’s</b> <b>attention</b> to spatial information or making spatial information more salient.|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedIntelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) {{have evolved}} {{dramatically}} from the simple prompt for remediation {{based on a}} wrong answer to the complex, adaptive systems of today that truly qualify as intelligent. Modern ITSs include a variety of applications that allow the emulation of a human teacher and the ITS acts as the student's private tutor, and interacts to effectively lend pedagogical assistance to the learner. Researchers have focused on modeling the learner's cognitive processes while solving problems, i. e., the "model tracing" approach. However, there is growing recognition that learning involves more than cognition, and that students' attention with an ITS also reflects "engagement" meaning the transient shifts in focus of attention and the emotions that are often associated with learning. Failure to track the learner's engagement could cause the ITSs to interrupt the learner with advice when the learner does not really need it.; The primary research questions addressed in this dissertation are (1) Can an ITS access <b>learner's</b> focus of <b>attention</b> and how? (2) If so, can <b>learner's</b> <b>attention</b> signals be used to infer learner's engagement? The research work in this dissertation provides a probabilistic model for ITSs to track <b>learner's</b> <b>attention</b> based on multiple sources of user input data. The <b>learner's</b> <b>attention</b> sequences thus were machine classified into five finite-state machines indicating guessing strategies, appropriate help use, and independent problem solving; over 90 % of problem events were categorized. Students were grouped via cluster analyses based on self reports of motivation. This indicated that students learned by themselves and learned from instructions, which are two primary learning goals when students were studying in ITSs. And a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) was built to enable ITSs {{to have the ability}} to detect the attention shifts and learning states. With this ability, ITSs will be more sensitive to the cognitive and motivational states of the learner and then be able to promote the learner's motivation through interaction with the learner.; To validate this Dynamic Bayesian Network Model, experiments have been designed and performed on undergraduate students at University of Southern California and high school students at Los Angeles area. The evaluation results show that applying this model should enable ITSs to track <b>learner's</b> <b>attention</b> and recognize <b>learner's</b> learning goals...|$|R

The results showed that during ACCESS task-based interactions, learners attended to form as reflected in a large number of LREs. Despite being brief, a majority of these LREs were correctly resolved, self-initiated, self- and other-responded, and focused on the target linguistic item: past-tense verbs. These results are discussed in terms of the potential effects of ACCESS task principles, different task features (i. e. task complexity, pre-task modeling, speaker role and group size), and learners’ approach to tasks on the incidence and characteristics of LREs...|$|R
