40|$|As {{the second}} most widely used {{artificial}} lift method in petroleum production (and first in produced amount), <b>electrical</b> <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> (ESP) maintains or increases flow rate by converting kinetic energy to hydraulic pressure of hydrocarbon fluids. To facilitate its optimal working conditions, an ESP has to be operated within a narrow application window.

Improving the efficiency and maintaining the performance of ESPs are of great significance to oil production economic benefit. To better understand the influence of viscosity on electrical submersible pumps, this work uses a CFD method to study the flow behaviors inside ESPs.

40|$|Multiphase {{machines}} {{have become}} challenging candidates for safety-critical applications that require wide fault tolerant capabilities and higher system reliability. However, this adds more complexity to the adopted power converters. In {{applications such as}} <b>electrical</b> <b>submersible</b> <b>pump</b> (ESP) systems, motor electric power is commonly fed using a three-phase low voltage variable frequency drive system (VFD) followed by a step-up transformer and a medium voltage long feeder. Application of multiphase machines in such applications was recently shown to provide possible benefits, however, this necessitates a more complex multiphase power converter and a multiphase transformer. Alternatively, a passive transformation is a viable and more economical solution to step up the three-phase output of a standard off-the-shelf three-phase inverter and convert it into n-phase secondary voltages. This paper investigates the existing connections of passive transformation and proposes a transformation, based on the well-known Scott connection, to convert the three-phase grid voltages to an n-phase supply. In comparison with other connections in the literature, the proposed connection uses only two magnetic cores and less number of total coils, hence less transformer volume. The paper also introduces the general per-phase equivalent circuit for three-phase to n-phase transformer, and the required modifications to conventional open-circuit and short-circuit tests to estimate the transformer parameters.

Meanwhile, the vibration characteristics corresponding to each operating condition were collected simultaneously. After 200 hours, a combined analysis of components wear measurement, performance and vibration are used to investigate the effect of 200 hours of wearing on this pump. In order to evaluate the volume of metal loss by this ESP, 3 D scan technology is applied, allowing comparison of the original and eroded impellers. Furthermore, CFD simulations on both the original and eroded pump geometries are developed in ANSYS-FLUENT to evaluate the performance variation. An erosion model for predicting erosion rate is introduced to the result of simulation and calibrated by the loss of thickness of the impeller that measured...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed at}} investigating {{the relationship between}} three phase induction motors vibration (MVS) and current signatures (MCS). This is essential due {{to the cost of}} vibration measuring equipment and in cases where vibration of interest point is not accessible; such as <b>electrical</b> <b>submersible</b> <b>pumps</b> (ESP) used in oil industry. A mathematical model was developed to understand the effects of two types of induction motors common faults; rotor bar imperfections and phase imbalance on the motor vibration and current signatures. An automated test facility was developed in which 1. 1 kW three phase motor could be tested under varying shaft rotation speeds and loads for validating the developed model. Time and frequency domains statistical parameters of the measured signals were calculated for fault detection and assessing its severity. The measured signals were also processed using the short time Fourier transform (STFT), the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and wavelet multi-resolution analysis (MRA). The non-stationary components, representing faults within induction motor measured vibration and current signals, were successfully detected using wavelet decomposition technique. An effective alternative to direct vibration measurement scheme, based on radial basis function networks, was developed to the reconstruction of motor vibration using measurements of one phase of the motor current. It was found that this method captured the features of induction motor faults with reasonable degrees of accuracy. Another method was also developed for the early detection and diagnosis of faults using an enhanced power factor method. Experimental results confirmed that the power factor can be used successfully for induction motor fault diagnosis and is also promising in assessing fault severity. The suggested two methods offer inexpensive, reliable and non-intrusive condition monitoring tools that suits real-time applications. Directions for further work were also outlined. ...|$|R
