[...] "On August 15th, at noon in broad daylight when everybody was eating lunch, I hit the road. Yes, I was afraid. Am I gonna live or die? And when <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> minefield and I seen it with my own eyes, I started sweating. I crossed over, looking for my new life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album is}} DeBarge's first studio release in 16 years, {{following}} {{a period of}} drug addiction and legal problems. After his release from prison in 2009, he was introduced by his manager, Pete Farmer, to music executives Ron Fair and Jimmy Iovine at Geffen and Interscope Records. DeBarge sang a cappella in his audition for the label. He later said of the meeting and audition, [...] "we put a plan together and the minute <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio I was so nervous, but I felt so much power just coming through me soon as I hit the microphone it was like, it was still there". He subsequently signed a recording deal with the label and began working on Second Chance.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> apartment, {{guards and}} prisoners saw me simultaneously.|$|E
5000|$|... “I am sure I will be punched like a bag. Like I am {{a pillow}} being pummeled...whether I win a medal or not, I {{will be a}} symbol of courage as soon as <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ring.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait here, and I {{will go up}} gently {{towards the}} window. She may see me. She will see me as <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> moonlight. At least I know an air by which she will {{recognize}} me, if I do but hum a stave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{four in the}} {{afternoon}} a soldier in red trousers brings a paper round to the jail, and they unlocks the door and I walks out. The guard at the door bows and I bows, and <b>I</b> <b>steps</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> grass and wades around to Doc Millikin's shack.|$|R
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shining {{circle of}} the {{electric}} light and halted again.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a little}} gray in the sky now; so <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> woods, and laid down for a nap before breakfast.|$|E
60|$|I {{paused for}} a moment to give some {{instructions}} about my own luggage. Then <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lift with the clerk and her.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all! I don't want {{to spoil}} a {{perfectly}} good Spring afternoon for you by pulling out the tragic stop. I had to say all that; but it's the last time. It shan't occur again. There will be no tragedy when <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> train to-morrow. <b>Is</b> there any chance that you might come and see me off?" ...|$|R
60|$|He glanced slyly at Comyn, and his Lordship {{laughed a}} little. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> unsuspectingly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> office.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> little hall. They {{were talking}} {{together}} earnestly. Arthur {{looked up and}} glared at me.|$|R
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> circle where Madam Mina slept, {{she woke}} from her sleep and, seeing me, {{cried out in}} pain that I had endured too much.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned her}} head swiftly in my direction; {{it was the only}} sign of {{surprise}} she deigned to make. At the same time <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> light and bowed profoundly.|$|E
6000|$|Countess. Why, yes! When in {{the instant}} after you [...] <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room, and found my niece there, [...] What she in this first moment of the heart [...] Ta'en with surprise-- ...|$|E
5000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bright sunlight, {{from the}} {{darkness}} of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind. (S. E. Hinton, The Outsiders) ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lamplight, saying: [...] "You {{need not}} search far. With your permission, Miss Carrington! Now I am only a guest here. Will you follow me?" ...|$|R
60|$|Yvonne's adieu {{was cold}} and formal--so cold and formal {{that it seemed to}} rob the {{sunshine}} of its glory for me as <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open air.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no sound}} save the moaning of {{the wind in the}} bare trees which stood {{by the side of the}} house and the patter of the fast-falling rain. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{carriage}} and the Count came to the window to me.|$|E
6000|$|This {{reception}} {{was something}} novel to me, who had cycled {{over thousands of}} miles, and I {{was not at all}} inclined to accept it {{at the hands of the}} boy. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hall. [...] "Can I see the master of this house?" [...] said I.|$|E
60|$|In {{opening the}} door of communication, it {{appeared}} as if I had also opened all the doors of all the bedchambers in the rectory. The moment <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> passage, out popped the children from one room after another, like rabbits out of their burrows.|$|E
5000|$|... "Lie in Our Graves" [...] is a {{song about}} reunion in death ("When <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> light / My arms are open wide") and the singer's hopes that the afterlife will be joyful and without regrets ("I can't believe that we would lie in our graves / Wondering if we had spent our living days well"). Its merry, upbeat feel {{in the face of}} dark subject matter is {{reminiscent}} {{of a lot of the}} band's other earlier songs such as [...] "What Would You Say", [...] "Tripping Billies", and most famously, [...] "Ants Marching".|$|R
60|$|Signaling Woola to heel <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> {{suddenly}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{room before}} the two men. At sight of me their long-swords flashed from the harness at their sides, but I raised my hand {{in a gesture of}} restraint.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a long {{trail to}} follow," [...] he said, slowly, [...] "trying {{to get back}} dues from the government. There's red tape and lawyers and rulings and {{evidence}} and courts to keep you waiting. I'm not certain," [...] continued the commissioner, with a profoundly meditative frown, [...] "whether this department that I'm the boss of has any jurisdiction or not. It's only Insurance, Statistics, and History, ma'am, and it don't sound {{as if it would}} cover the case. But sometimes a saddle blanket can be made to stretch. You keep your seat, just for a few minutes, ma'am, till <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> next room and see about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "While High was {{examining}} some hieroglyphics on {{the wall}} that the stone-masons must have made when their tools slipped, <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> front room. That was at least thirty by fifty feet, stone floor, six little windows like square port-holes that didn't let much light in.|$|E
60|$|The door closed; {{they were}} gone. I was ashamed: I {{was the only}} friend of the dying man that had no spirit, no courage. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room, and said I would be a man and would follow. But we are made as we are made, and we cannot help it. I did not go.|$|E
60|$|I {{smile as}} I recall {{the feeling of}} pride with which <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 'bus {{and started for the}} Grand Central Hotel. And yet, after all, values are relative. That boy had {{something}} which I have lost. I would give much of my present knowledge of the world for the keen savor of life which filled my nostrils at that time.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do," [...] I {{said in the}} {{language}} of Ahm, and <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> firelight before them. Lys gave a little cry of joy and started toward me, but Tsa grasped her arm and dragged her back.|$|R
50|$|This complex {{sentence}} contains an adverbial clause, When <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bright sunlight {{from the darkness}} of the movie house. The adverbial clause describes when the action of the main clause, I had only two things on my mind, took place.|$|R
60|$|My {{first impulse}} was to await {{darkness}} before attempting to cross the plain, so deeply implanted are habits of thought; but of a sudden I recollected the perpetual noonday brilliance which envelopes Pellucidar, and with a smile <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> forth <b>into</b> <b>the</b> day-light.|$|R
60|$|I felt a deal like an impostor, in truth, as <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> street, disdaining {{to inquire}} {{of any of}} the people of the Star and Garter where an American agent might be found. The day was gray and cheerless, the colour of my own spirits as I walked toward the east, knowing that the city lay that way. But I soon found plenty to {{distract}} me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You have no idea, sir, what a sight it was, in Court, {{when they}} first knew that I wasn't a Butcher, after all! I wasn't {{produced}} at the first examination, {{when there was a}} remand; but I was at the second. And when <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> box, in full police uniform, and the whole party saw how they had been done, actually a groan of horror and dismay proceeded from 'em in the dock! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 'bus and {{we drove}} off. As we turned {{out of the}} station I caught a last glimpse of our shadower. He was {{standing}} close to the main exit with his hands behind him, looking up to the sky as though anxious to discover whether it were still raining. He looked into our 'bus as it clattered by, and my companion, who caught sight of him, leaned back in her seat.|$|E
60|$|She was comforted {{long before}} I left her. But as <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> street again a man accosted me. Evidently {{he had been}} on the watch, {{awaiting}} me. He fell <b>into</b> <b>step</b> beside me almost before I realized his presence. It was Escovedo.|$|R
6000|$|We {{had been}} making a call {{together}} that evening, and afterward Tom ran up to my rooms for a pipe and a chat before going on to his own luxurious apartments. <b>I</b> had <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> other room for a moment when I heard Tom sing out: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> saloon with {{my heart}} lighter {{than it had been}} for days. Ransome was at the {{sideboard}} preparing to lay the table for the first sea dinner of the passage. He turned his head, and something in his eyes checked my modest elation.|$|R
