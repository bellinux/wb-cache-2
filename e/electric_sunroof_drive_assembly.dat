40|$|Abstract. Traditional {{methods of}} sunroof {{operations}} involve controllers with mechanic or electric buttons, which produce noises and lack flexibility. This paper devised a controller for <b>electric</b> <b>sunroofs</b> with CAN-USB converters and tablet PCs. The CAN-USB converter was implemented to bridge communication between tablet PCs and sunroofs. The tablet PC {{served as a}} control interface and an application was developed to control sunroofs by using the UDS protocol. A C language compiler was embedded in to support customized operations. This approach provides functionality of reprogramming for sunroof operations and offers sound-proof actions...|$|R
50|$|The new Scimitar GT car {{retained}} the straight-six engine from the Sabre, but with triple SU carburettors as standard it now produced 120 bhp and propelled {{the car to}} {{a top speed of}} 117 mph. It was launched at the Earls Court Motor Show in 1964; it was praised for its elegant lines and performance figures for a price of £1,292. The price included wire wheels and a luxurious interior with comprehensive instrumentation. Optional extras included a choice of De Normanville overdrive unit, <b>electric</b> <b>sunroof</b> and ZF gearbox. Reliant produced approximately 296 straight-six Scimitar GTs.|$|R
40|$|A screw-released roller brake {{including}} an input <b>drive</b> <b>assembly,</b> an output <b>drive</b> <b>assembly,</b> {{a plurality of}} locking sprags, a mechanical tripper nut for unlocking the sprags, and a casing therefor. The sprags consist of three dimensional (3 -D) sprag members having pairs of contact surface regions which engage respective pairs of contact surface regions included in angular grooves or slots formed in the casing and the output <b>drive</b> <b>assembly.</b> The sprags operate to lock the output <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> to the casing to prevent rotation thereof in an idle mode of operation. In a drive mode of operation, the tripper is either self actuated or motor driven and is translated linearly up and down against a spline and at the limit of its travel rotates the sprags which unlock while coupling the input <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> to the output <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> so as to impart a turning motion thereto in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction...|$|R
50|$|Mazda New Zealand {{assembled}} {{this generation}} {{for four years}} with few changes. Ford's variants (since 1987 all built in the same Ford-Mazda joint venture Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand (VANZ) factory in Wiri, South Auckland) had minor styling and equipment differences (the top Telstar hatchback had an <b>electric</b> <b>sunroof)</b> and anti-lock brakes were now standard on some models, for which factory engineers had to build a special test rig {{at the end of}} the assembly line. These were also the first 626/Telstar models to have factory fitted air conditioning, though only standard on the top Limited (626) and TX5 XRi (Telstar) five-door hatchbacks.|$|R
50|$|Many {{other changes}} were also made in 1980. The body was {{completely}} redesigned, making it slightly larger {{and with a}} more squared off roofline. Additional emphasis was given to ergonomics, aerodynamics, and safety. Shoulder room, leg room, and head space were all increased, and the trunk was slightly enlarged for more luggage capacity. In particular, rear seat passengers received more room for their heads and legs. The shifter was {{moved closer to the}} driver, and ventilation was greatly improved. The interior was made quieter with additional carpeting and other acoustic dampening materials and a double-thickness front bulkhead. An <b>electric</b> <b>sunroof</b> was also new.|$|R
5000|$|Initial trim levels {{consisted}} of base and LS; the latter replacing the [...] "Euro" [...] trim.

This Lumina was also sold with police (code 9C3) and taxi packages, {{due to the}} Chevrolet Caprice being discontinued after the 1996 model year. (1998 in Mexico, also replaced with a Holden-sourced Caprice) Production began on Monte Carlo coupes in February 1994 and March 7, 1994 for Lumina sedans at GM's Oshawa manufacturing plant, for a June 6, 1994 market launch for the latter model.|$|R
40|$|A joint {{assembly}} is provided {{which includes a}} <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> and a swivel mechanism. The <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> features a motor operatively associated with a plurality of drive shafts for driving auxiliary elements, and a plurality of swivel shafts for pivoting the <b>drive</b> <b>assembly.</b> The swivel mechanism engages the swivel shafts and has a fixable element that may be attached to a foundation. The swivel mechanism is adapted {{to cooperate with the}} swivel shafts to pivot the <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> with at least two degrees of freedom relative to the foundation. The {{joint assembly}} allows for all components to remain encased in a tight, compact, and sealed package, making it ideal for space, exploratory, and commercial applications...|$|R
50|$|The R3 {{version was}} {{introduced}} for the 2009 year model.
