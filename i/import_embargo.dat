Silesian linen weavers suffered under Prussia's free trade policy and British competitors that already used machines destroyed the competitiveness of Silesian linen. The situation worsened after Russia imposed an <b>import</b> <b>embargo</b> and the Silesian linen industry began to mechanize. In several towns this traditional craft died out altogether, costing many linen weavers their profession. As social conditions worsened, growing unrest culminated in the Silesian cotton weavers' uprising (German: Schlesischer Weberaufstand) of 1844. This uprising, {{on the eve of}} the revolution of 1848, was closely observed by German society and treated by several artists, among them Gerhart Hauptmann (with his 1892 play The Weavers) and Heinrich Heine (poem Die schlesischen Weber).|$|E

Regardless {{of the policy}} response, the importing country may be worse off after a new genetically modified food (GMF) is introduced. While an <b>import</b> <b>embargo</b> may be preferable to allowing free access to unlabelled GMF imports, permitting labelled imports is typically superior to an embargo. Thus, import embargoes on products of biotechnology should not be generally allowed. The paper provides surprising support for the existing WTO provisions on Technical Barriers to Trade, but suggests significant potential problems with the recently negotiated Biosafety Protocol. asymmetric information, biotechnology, genetically modified foods, <b>import</b> <b>embargo,</b> labelling, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

30|$|Recent {{years have}} seen closer {{diplomatic}} relations between Egypt and Russia {{that have led to}} a significant growth in their bilateral agricultural trade. As one of the world’s leading producers and exporters of oranges, such trade growth represents an opportunity for Egypt to promote its orange exports to Russia. Moreover, in conjunction with Egyptian-Russian bilateral agricultural trade growth in recent years, Russia imposed <b>import</b> <b>embargos</b> on agricultural and food commodities from several countries, creating a supply gap of around 25  % on the Russian orange market, thus representing further export opportunities for Egyptian oranges. Motivated by these developments in the Russian orange market, this paper used a Rotterdam import allocation model to analyse demand relationships among major orange suppliers to Russia during the period 1996 – 2014.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{preamble}} of the Agreement {{establishing the}} WTO, {{the so called}} Marrakesh Agreement, points out the general significance of environmental protection and sustainable development. The WTO law contains several provisions concerning the environment. However, {{it is not yet}} finally clarified in how far WTO Members can adopt measures to protect the environment where those measures have trade restricting effects. This question is particularly problematic where a Member implements such a measure unilaterally and the measure affects other countries’ policies. The question at stake is to what extent Member States can unilaterally adopt measures to protect the environment where those measures have extraterritorial effect, i. e. where those measures require other states to change their policies in order {{to gain access to the}} importing country’s market. The GATT/WTO adjudicating body had to deal with two disputes addressing this issue, namely the Tuna-Dolphin dispute 5 and the Shrimp-Turtle case. These two disputes are of outstanding importance for the issue of unilateral measures with extraterritorial effect to protect the environment. Both disputes dealt with the question whether <b>import</b> <b>embargoes,</b> that were inconsistent with Article XI of the GATT for they imposed quantitative import restrictions, could be justified under Article XX (g) of the GATT as measures to conserve exhaustible natural resources. The two decisions interpreted Article XX of the GATT, particularly paragraph g of that provision, differently. The question whether countries can unilaterally adopt measures to protect the environment where those measures have extraterritorial effect must be analysed against the backdrop of both WTO jurisprudence and general principles of international law...|$|R

This article examines and ranks alternative trade policy responses available to an importing country with concerns over such standards. While a full <b>import</b> <b>embargo</b> may sometimes be preferable to allowing unrestricted access to unlabeled noconforming imports, a partial embargo that allows imports which demonstrably conform to the standard is always a better policy; and labeling solutions, which separate conforming and non-conforming imports, are typically better still. Consequently, full import embargoes based on non-conformity with labour or environmental standards are poor policy choices and should generally remain prohibited by WTO rules.

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a model of}} dynamic endogenous product innovation and international trade, using it to calculate the welfare effects of lower intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in the non-innovating South than in the innovating North. We find that it is generally in the North’s interest to protect its innovating sector by an <b>import</b> <b>embargo</b> on IPR-offending goods from abroad. We explain the paradoxical outcome where the North gains from weaker IPR enforcement in the South through a decomposition of the dynamic welfare formula. Key features include the ability of lower Southern IPR protection to spur innovation of Northern goods and to make available greater resources for Northern production of current consumption goods. Maintaining Northern IPR standards {{can be in the}} South’s interests even though the South would favor lower uniform levels of IPR protection. ...|$|E
30|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} closer diplomatic relations between Egypt and Russia, which {{have led to}} significant growth in the countries’ bilateral agricultural trade. As a world-leading producer and exporter of oranges, these developments represent an opportunity for Egypt to promote its orange exports to Russia. Another emerging opportunity for Egypt to increase its share in the Russian market for imported oranges has been provided by <b>import</b> <b>embargos</b> imposed by Russia in recent years on agricultural and food commodities from several countries, creating a supply gap of around 25  % in the Russian orange market. To assess the competitiveness of Egyptian oranges and explore the potential export opportunities presented by the Russian market, this paper uses a Rotterdam import allocation model to analyse demand relationships among major orange suppliers to Russia during the period 1996 – 2014. The results show that in comparison with other orange suppliers, Egypt enjoys a strong comparative advantage in the export of oranges to Russia. The econometric results suggest that both Morocco and Egypt would benefit the most if Russia were to allocate a larger budget to the import of oranges. The expenditure elasticity estimates indicate that an increase in Russia’s demand for imported oranges would lead to increases in the quantity of Egypt’s orange exports, {{as well as in}} its share of the Russian orange market. Furthermore, cross-price elasticity estimates reveal that Egyptian oranges are substitutes for Turkish and South African oranges, implying that Russia has a tendency to switch to these two suppliers when Egyptian oranges become relatively expensive. In light of these results, the adoption of strategies to produce oranges sustainably and cost-effectively, upgrade the orange value chain, acquire processing technologies and enhance the technical and organisational capacity of farmers and exporters could be useful means for promoting exports and boosting the competitiveness of Egyptian oranges on the Russian market.|$|R
40|$|Shrimp {{culture in}} Bangladesh {{has emerged as}} an {{important}} aquaculture industry {{over the last three}} decades although its culture in greater parts of the farming area is done in traditional ways. In the meantime, the government of Bangladesh has taken necessary measures along with the private sectors to increase production, upgrade processing industries and to promote export performance. Long supply chain in raw material collection, inadequate infrastructure facilities, poor level of cool chain and lack of adequate HACCP-based training on hygiene and sanitation of different groups of people involved in the field level are the main problems of quality loss of raw materials. Shortage of raw materials results in poor capacity utilization of the processing plants. The growth of bagda (P. monodon) hatchery has expanded rapidly over the last few years, remaining mostly concentrated in Cox's Bazar region is enough to meet the target production. However, {{there is a shortage of}} pelleted shrimp feed in Bangladesh. A large number of export processors are now producing increasing amounts of value-added products such as individually quick-frozen, peeled and divined, butterfly cut shrimp, as well as cooked products. The export earnings from value added products is about half of the total export value. About 95 % of total fish products are exported to European countries, USA and Japan and the remaining to the Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Most of the EU approved shrimp processing industries have been upgraded with laboratory facilities and provided HACCP training to their workers. As of now, HACCP is applied on the processing plants, but to ensure the quality of raw materials and to reduce risks, shrimp farms are also required to adopt HACCP plan. There is increased pressure time to time from importing countries for fish processors to establish effective quality assurance system in processing plants. Fish Inspection and Quality Control (FIQC) of the Department of Fisheries while having moderately equipped laboratories with chemical, bio-chemical and microbiological testing facilities and qualified technical personnel, the creation of facilities for testing of antibiotics is underway. FIQC mainly supervises quality aspects of the processing plants and has little or no control over raw material supply chains from farm to processing plants. Bangladesh export consignments sometimes face rejection due to reported poor quality of the products. Three types of barriers are reported for export of shrimp to EU countries. These are:(1) government participation in trade and restrictive practices (state aid, countervailing duties, state trading enterprises, government monopoly practices), customs and administrative entry procedures (anti-dumping duties, customs valuation, classification, formalities, rules of origin); (2) technical barriers to trade or TBT (technical regulations, standards, testing, certification arrangement); (3) specific limitations (quantitative restrictions, <b>import</b> licensing, <b>embargoes,</b> exchange control, discriminatory sourcing, export restraints, measures to regulate domestic prices, requirements concerning marking, labeling and packaging) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} article is to outline topical issues of {{economics}} security, competitiveness and the strategic mission of a region. The Krasnodar region is a prosperous agrarian territory considered {{as one of the}} main investment-attractive regions ensuring Russian food security. It possesses a significant resource potential, which is able to provide both <b>import</b> substitution of <b>embargoed</b> goods and ensure economic, and food security not only of a region but also of our country. The article highlights the strategic objectives of the Krasnodar region agrarian sector that aim at meeting the needs of the regional population and ensuring Russian food security. It is inferred that further development of grain production, as a cornerstone of agriculture, livestock and rice industries, is crucial for implementation of the import substitution strategy in the Krasnodar region. Authors assess the production of basic food items in the region, indicating that the local agro-industrial businesses demonstrated 100 % ability to meet the population demand under sanctions for a number of food products, such as meet, sausages, dairy, animal fat, confectionery, sugar, flour, vegetable oil, bread and pastries, rice, canned fruit and vegetables, fruit juices, mineral and table water, etc. According to the present article, the main objective of ensuring Russian food security and import substitution in the agri-food industry under current economic restrictions is an effective use of regional food production capacities and raw material base development. Competitiveness and economic development of the Krasnodar region directly depend on its investment attractiveness. It is revealed that the Krasnodar region competitiveness, economic development and consequently its economic and food security will be determined not only by a favorable transport-geographical position and significant natural resources reserves, but will depend on the regional authorities activity, labor force quality and infrastructure availability. The article concludes with investment policy goals as the most important factor of Krasnodar region competitiveness and economic security until 202...|$|R
40|$|The W-Arly-Pendjari (WAP) ecosystem, {{shared among}} Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger, {{represents}} the last lion stronghold of West Africa. To {{assess the impact}} of trophy hunting on lion populations in hunting areas of the WAP, we analyzed trends in harvest rates from 1999 to 2014. We also investigated whether the hunting areas with higher initial hunting intensity experienced steeper declines in lion harvest between 1999 and 2014, and whether lion densities in hunting areas were lower than in national parks. Lion harvest rate remained overall constant in the WAP. At initial hunting intensities below 1. 5 lions/ 1000 km 2, most hunting areas experienced an increase in lion harvest rate, although that increase was of lower magnitude for hunting areas with higher initial hunting intensity. The proportion of hunting areas that experienced a decline in lion harvest rate increased at initial hunting intensities above 1. 5 lions/ 1000 km 2. In 2014, the lion population of the WAP was estimated with a spoor count at 418 (230 – 648) adults and sub-adult individuals, comparable to the 311 (123 – 498) individuals estimated in the previous 2012 spoor survey. We found no significant lion spoor density differences between national parks and hunting areas. Hunting areas with higher mean harvest rates did not have lower lion densities. The ratio of large adult males, females and sub-adults was similar between the national parks and the hunting areas. These results suggested that the lion population was not significantly affected by hunting in the WAP. We concluded that a quota of 1 lion/ 1000 km 2 would be sustainable for the WAP. Based on our results, an <b>import</b> <b>embargo</b> on lion trophies from the WAP would not be justified. It could ruin the incentive of local actors to conserve lions in hunting areas, and lead to a drastic reduction of lion range in West Africa. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|While the {{liberalization}} of international trade allows for joint welfare gains, concerns regarding the resurgence of protectionism have spiked in recent years. On one hand, {{this is due to}} basic collective action problems in trade liberalization. On the other, protectionism can be motivated by political reasons which trump the realization of joint gains through international cooperation. Objectives may include the protection of domestic industries, sanctions or capturing larger export market shares. Depending on final goals, protectionism can be implemented by using tariff and non-tariff measures that artificially restricts the movement of the goods or services between the countries. Russia has put in place an embargo on food imports from the European Union (EU) {{in the wake of the}} Ukraine crisis and the EU/United States of America sanctions regime. This has caused some food exports from the EU to Russia to drop significantly. However, it is not known how this embargo affected the entire food exports to Russia. Object of the research: The impact of the Russian embargo on the European Union‘s international trade in food products. Aim of the research: To investigate Russian <b>import</b> <b>embargo</b> impact to the European Union countries' food exports. Tasks of the research:  To analyze the European Union’s external trade with Russia and other trading partners.  Theoretically investigate the significance of foreign trade on the economy and international trade regulatory measures.  Theoretically investigate the economic impact of the embargo and application of the gravity model.  To apply gravity model in order to execute the investigation of the EU countries` food exports changes after Russian embargo The main results on investigation show that the Russian embargo has had the most significant effect on large food exporters: Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Poland. Meanwhile, only Luxembourg and Slovakia did not have any losses regarding to Russian embargo. The biggest food export losses of 2015 belong to Germany, Lithuania, Netherlands and Poland. The executed prognosis for the year 2016 reveals that most EU countries will have higher food export volume than in a year 2015. Nevertheless it will still be less than in 2014.

40|$|In {{the late}} year 2013 events started to unfold in Ukraine’s capital city Kiev {{that would change}} the {{political}} and economic environment of the EU and Russia. The tension had been building for years between the two parties with Ukraine in the middle and during 2014 the tension blew up and events started to escalate into a crisis, which we now know as the 2014 Ukraine crisis. The crisis would include political, economic, and even military actions by all the parties involved with Ukraine slipping close to civil war. Both political and economic hardships followed for others as well with both the EU and Russia placing heavy political and economic sanctions on each other. Most notably in terms of this paper, the Russian federation placed total <b>import</b> <b>embargo</b> sanctions on food imports from the EU and some other countries. This meant that a Finnish dairy company, Valio, had to engage in corporate crisis management as almost a fifth of its total revenue was cut in a heartbeat. Valio had been prepared for some kind of complications with their Russian market as events started to unfold in Ukraine in the beginning of 2014 but never did they suspect that a complete shutdown of the Russian market would follow. The company is still recovering {{after more than a year}} after the sanctions were posed and have not been able to supplement the lost revenue streams. This research is a qualitative research aiming to find answers to the main questions: 1) What is the 2014 Ukraine crisis and what kind of special implications does it have and 2) How did the crisis affect Valio and how did Valio fare in its crisis management efforts. The data has been collected both from secondary document sources and primary sources. The main findings of this research are that {{the political and economic}} environment of the EU and Russia has gone through a profound change during the years 2013 - 2015. The companies and governments should re-evaluate what kind of environment they are now facing and what kinds of risks the new situation poses. This also calls for a deep academic analysis from the academic community. In corporate crisis management of Valio the main findings are that the former literature has looked into crisis management as one-time occurrence but the new crises and global events would call for a more on-going crisis analysis and active crisis management. Thus, corporate crisis management should be viewed as a cycle. Valio specifically handled the situation surprisingly well, considering that their revenue was indeed cut by a fifth. The main aspects of crisis management, which Valio did not handle as well, concern the learning curve of crisis management. They could be doing more in order to prepare for future crises better by learning from this experience. The situation is then still on-going in the autumn 2015 both in Ukraine and within Valio...|$|E
40|$|The {{provision}} of food security in Russia {{under conditions of}} the WTO and the Customs Union, the food <b>import</b> <b>embargo</b> and sanctions is a complex and multiscale task for supplying industry with the agricultural raw materials and the population with foodstuffs on stable basis and for achieving relative independence from the imports of raw materials and food products [1]. Currently, the agribusiness in the Stavropol Territory is developing faster than the agriculture in the neighboring regions of the North Caucasus Federal District. An analysis {{of the diversity of}} natural and socio-economic conditions in this Territory has shown that the existing areas of agricultural specialization do not correspond to the potential of the territory and the food security in general. With the reduction of the state financial support, {{an increase in the number}} of unprofitable farms has been marked. The structure of the foodstuff manufacturing (potatoes, fruits, milk, and meat) is increasingly drawn to the small-scale farms. The consequence of the land and economic reforms becomes the imbalance structure of agricultural lands, livestock population, crop acreages and rotations, deterioration of soil fertility indices in large and medium agricultural enterprises. The low yielding natural forage grassland are prevailing. A biologically simplified system of farming has been formed, which leads to a short-term economic effect on the background of the phytosanitary and agrochemical sustainability drop of tillable lands and to the deterioration of the natural environment state. The production and yield of agricultural crops is increasingly dependent on weather conditions. This is unacceptable for the recovery of livestock production and effective arable farming [2]. In accordance with the implementation of the «Strategy of Socio-Economic Development of the North Caucasus Federal District until 2025 », the Stavropol Territory in the future will continue focusing on the development of agribusiness. The main tasks of the agricultural production of enterprises should be as follows: the correction of specialization and location of livestock production in view of the natural resource base of the landscape; the increase in the share of green fodders from pastures and hayfields; the use of farming technologies adaptive to the climatic conditions that enhance the productivity of agricultural lands and efficiency of the spent material and technical resources; the conservation of degraded agricultural lands followed by grassing, etc. [4 – 6]. Such an approach will, on the one hand, prevent the manifestation of the adverse natural processes, and, on the other, ensure the environmental sustainability of the territory and the dynamic development of agribusiness, the economic competitiveness of the Russian market and the possibility of import substitution [7]. The aim of the “pilot” draft is to create land tenure with optimal structure and balance. Therefore, agro-ecological evaluation of «Dubovskiy» potential is done to take proper measures to optimize territorial organization of land tenure. The formation of land tenure model will trigger similar actions in 26 districts of Stavropol territory...|$|E
