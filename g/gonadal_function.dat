40|$|STUDY QUESTION: Do {{young adult}} {{survivors}} of childhood cancer know their fertility status, {{in the context}} of their parenthood goals and screening for <b>gonadal</b> <b>functioning?</b> SUMMARY ANSWER: While 80 % of survivors (who were without children) wanted children in the future, most did not know their fertility status, and screening for <b>gonadal</b> <b>functioning</b> was underutilized. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Survivors of childhood cancer are at risk for infertility, but fertility counseling and assessment are underutilized. Separate studies indicated that survivors' fertility-related knowledge is poor and that they often wanted to have children. Yet, studies have not investigated the intersection of both issues, as well as potential distress if parenthood goals are not met. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Young adult male and female survivors of childhood cancer (N = 149) completed cross-sectional surveys, and data for those without children (n = 105, 70. 5 %) are presented here. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants were 20 - 40 years old (M = 26. 5), diagnosed 5 - 33 years prior to study participation, and completed questionnaires online. Knowledge of fertility status, parenthood goals, and potential distress if survivors were unable to have children were assessed. Medical records were reviewed for hormone levels as indicators of screening for <b>gonadal</b> <b>functioning.</b> MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Most survivors (n = 81; 77. 1 %) did not know their fertility status, while over 80 % (n = 89) wanted children (neither aspect varied by socio-demographic/cancer-specific factors). Two-thirds of survivors indicated they would be distressed if parenthood goals remained unfulfilled; especially female (versus male, t = 2. 64; P = 0. 01) or partnered (versus single, t = - 3. 45; P < 0. 001) survivors. Forty survivors (38. 1 %) had documented assessments of <b>gonadal</b> <b>functioning,</b> of which 33 (82. 5 %) reported not knowing their fertility status. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Relevant risk factors may have not been identified owing to limited sample size and missing treatment information. The underutilization of screening for <b>gonadal</b> <b>functioning</b> needs further exploration in other pediatric centers. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Most adult childhood cancer survivors want to become parents, but do not know their fertility status, which could cause significant psychological distress. Healthcare providers should continuously address fertility among survivors, but more research is needed on how to implement routine fertility counseling and/or testing...|$|R

40|$|The <b>gonadal</b> <b>functions</b> of {{male and}} female {{individuals}} are mainly regulated by two gonadotrophic hormones, folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), both secreted by the pituitary. In spontaneously ovulating mammals (e. g. rat and man) periodic discharges of these hormones, resulting in ovulation, are characteristic of the female, whereas similar periodic discharges have never been observed in the male. Every four or five days female rats show a peak in serum LH on the afternoon of the day preceding ovulation (the day of prooestrus), which coincides with an increase in serum FSH. The high FSH level is maintained till the afternoon of oestrus (Gay et al, 1970; Daane and Parlow, 1971).

50|$|Insects play a {{large role}} in what is known about neurosecretion. In simpler organisms neurosecretion {{mechanisms}} regulate the heart, the process of metamorphosis, and directly influences the development of the <b>gonadal</b> <b>function.</b> In more advanced organisms the <b>gonadal</b> <b>function</b> is manipulated by the intermediary endocrine processes. Axons from neurosecretory cells trace to corpora cardiaca and corpora allata and produce and secrete a brain hormone which insect physiologists suspect is bound to a large carrier protein. Although the function is unknown, there are a multitude of these cells found in the ventral ganglia of the nerve cord. Neurosecretory cells, found in clusters in the medial and lateral parts of the brain, control corpora allata activity by producing juvenile hormone during the larval or nymphal instars, the phase between periods of molting in insects. The production of this hormone inhibits the insect during the conversion to maturity and reactivating once the fully-grown adult is prepared for reproduction. The 3rd International Symposium on Neurosecretion at the University of Bristol discussed the intracellular structure of the neurosecretory cells and the migration path to the target organs or vascular fluid areas by neurosecretory granules. More is being discovered on the identification of granules in hormones and the linking of their development with the organism’s physiologic state.|$|E

5000|$|The {{hormonal}} {{control of}} ovulation is {{also related to}} the organizational/activational hypothesis. [...] Both males and females rats exhibit luteinizing hormone (LH) pulses in which LH is released from the anterior pituitary due to the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. Females, however, show an increase in LH pulse frequency around ovulation due to the positive feedback mechanism. When estrogen is increased in the blood, the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) of the hypothalamus causes the release of GnRH. The GnRH surge brings about a surge in LH and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Since females have a cyclic <b>gonadal</b> <b>function,</b> {{there may be a}} sexual dimorphism in the gonadal secretion. When female rats are injected with testosterone there is no positive feedback occurring and no LH surge. Moreover, castrated males will exhibit LH surges, similar to female cyclic gonadal behavior.|$|E

However, the researches could not be furthered due to laws related to preparation of protein-based pharmaceuticals. Still, his studies widened the understanding of conditions such as follicular maturation, atresia, spermatogenesis, primate reproduction and lactational amenorrhea.
