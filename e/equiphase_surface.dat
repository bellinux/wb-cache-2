40|$|When circularly {{polarized}} (CP) microstrip antennas are bent, the polarization becomes elliptical. We present a simple model {{that describes the}} phenomenon. The two linear modes present in a CP patch are modeled separately and added together to produce CP. Bending distorts the almost-spherical <b>equiphase</b> <b>surface</b> of a linearly polarized patch, which leads to phase imbalance in the far-field of a CP patch. The model predicts both the frequency shifting of the axial ratio band {{as well as the}} narrowing of the axial ratio beam. Uncontrolled bending is a problem associated especially with flexible textile antennas, and wearable antennas should therefore be designed somewhat conformal...|$|E
40|$|Recently Einstein’s {{invariance}} of {{the phase}} of a plane wave (1905) {{has been described as}} ”questionable” [Y-S Huang 2007]. Another definition of this phase, taking into account a ”relativistically induced optical anisotropy ” for isotropic medium in moving, has been proposed [A. Gjurchinovski 2007]. We suggest (logically) to determine this ”relativistically induced effect ” if the isotropic medium is the vacuum. We prove that the basic Lorentz invariant, in vacuum, is not {{the phase of}} a plane wave (ωt−˜k. ˜r) but the phase of a spherical wave (ωt − kr). According to Poincaré, an isotropic spherical wave is not LTed (Lorentz transformed) into an isotropic spherical wave (Einstein 1905) but LTed into an anisotropic ellipsoïdal wave (c = 1, relativity of simultaneity). Poincaré’s ellipsoidal wavefront (1906) is an <b>equiphase</b> <b>surface.</b> Our approach consists in deleting (˜ k. ˜r → kr) and not adding (ω → ˜ k. ũ) a scalar product [A. Gjurchinovski 2007]. The Lorenz gauge is connected with the invariance of the phase of a spherical wave and the transverse gauge with Einstein’s invariant. From Poincaré’s invariant we deduce a Doppler formula that {{is not the same as}} Einstein’s one. We call this formula ”Poincaré’s formula ” because it is unseparable of Poincaré’s theory of expansion of space and therefore the measurements of Hubble. 1 Invariance of the phase of a plane wave, transverse gauge an...|$|E
40|$|The phase {{centre of}} Fabry-Pérot Cavity antennas {{radiating}} broadside pencil beams is studied adopting a leaky-wave model of their radiation mechanism. Different definitions are {{considered for the}} phase centre, both local, based on curvature properties of the <b>equiphase</b> <b>surfaces</b> in the far field, and global, based on the minimization of suitable functionals of the antenna phase pattern. Analytical formulas are derived for the phase-center location {{as a function of}} the relevant leaky-mode attenuation constant and are validated on specific examples of antennas. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R
