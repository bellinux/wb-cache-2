What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> point of origin... it's more complex than saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E
500|$|Thirty-four {{years after}} Branded to Kill, Suzuki {{directed}} Pistol Opera (2001), a loose sequel co-produced by Shochiku and filmed at Nikkatsu. The character Goro Hanada returns {{as a mentor}} figure to the new Number Three, played by Makiko Esumi. However, Joe Shishido was replaced by Mikijiro Hira {{in the role of}} Hanada. Suzuki has said that the original intention was for Shishido to play the character again but that the film's producer, Satoru Ogura, wanted Hira for the role. Reviews were of a favourable nature on par with its predecessor. Jonathan Rosenbaum supposed, [...] "Can <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> film a masterpiece without being sure that I understand it? I think so..." [...] Although some, such as Elvis Mitchell for The Village Voice, felt its zeal fell slightly short of the original.|$|E
500|$|On 16 March 1756, Johnson {{was arrested}} for an {{outstanding}} debt of £5 18s. Unable to contact anyone else, he wrote to the writer and publisher Samuel Richardson. Richardson, who had previously lent Johnson money, sent him six guineas to show his good will, and the two became friends. Soon after, Johnson met and befriended the painter Joshua Reynolds, who so impressed Johnson that he declared him [...] "almost the only man whom <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> friend". Reynolds' younger sister Frances observed during their time together [...] "that men, women and children gathered around him [...] ", laughing at his gestures and gesticulations. In addition to Reynolds, Johnson was close to Bennet Langton and Arthur Murphy. Langton was a scholar and an admirer of Johnson who persuaded his way into a meeting with Johnson {{which led to a}} long friendship. Johnson met Murphy during the summer of 1754 after Murphy came to Johnson about the accidental republishing of the Rambler No. 190, and the two became friends. Around this time, Anna Williams began boarding with Johnson. She was a minor poet who was poor and becoming blind, two conditions that Johnson attempted to change by providing room for her and paying for a failed cataract surgery. Williams, in turn, became Johnson's housekeeper.|$|E

500|$|The film {{switches}} the infertility from male {{to female}} but never explains its cause: environmental destruction and divine punishment are considered. This unanswered question (and {{others in the}} film) {{have been attributed to}} Cuarón's dislike for expository film: [...] "There's a kind of cinema I detest, which is a cinema that is about exposition and explanations... It's become now what <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> medium for lazy readers... Cinema is a hostage of narrative. [...] And I'm very good at narrative as a hostage of cinema." [...] Cuarón's disdain for back-story and exposition led him to use the concept of female infertility as a [...] "metaphor for the fading sense of hope". [...] The [...] "almost mythical" [...] Human Project is turned into a [...] "metaphor for the possibility of the evolution of the human spirit, the evolution of human understanding." [...] Without dictating how the audience should feel {{by the end of the}} film, Cuarón encourages viewers to come to their own conclusions about the sense of hope depicted in the final scenes: [...] "We wanted the end to be a glimpse of a possibility of hope, for the audience to invest their own sense of hope into that ending. So if you're a hopeful person you'll see a lot of hope, and if you're a bleak person you'll see a complete hopelessness at the end." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{he rarely}} played for Chelsea as a striker, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers played Sturridge as a striker in most matches. His ability to still drop between lines and pull wide and attack defences, similar to former strike partner Luis Suárez's playing-style, {{has led to}} Rodgers {{describing}} him as [...] "what <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> 'nine-and-a-half".|$|E

2500|$|Chapter 26, {{the final}} chapter of the Dhammapada, states [...] "Him <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> brahmin who has put aside weapons and renounced {{violence}} toward all creatures. He neither kills nor helps others to kill". These sentences are interpreted by many Buddhists (especially in the West) as an injunction against supporting any legal measure which might lead to the death penalty. However, almost throughout history, countries where Buddhism has been the official religion (which have included most of the Far East and Indochina) have practiced the death penalty. One exception is {{the abolition of the}} death penalty by the Emperor Saga of Japan in 818. This lasted until 1165, although in private manors executions conducted as a form of retaliation continued to be conducted.|$|E

2500|$|The {{family members}} all played music. [...] Mr. Scruggs had played an open back banjo using the frailing technique, though {{as an adult}} Earl had no {{recollection}} of his father's playing. Mrs. Scruggs played the pump organ. Earl's siblings, older brothers Junie and Horace, and older sisters Eula Mae and Ruby, all played banjo and guitar. Scruggs recalls a visit to his uncle's home at age six to hear a blind banjo player named Mack Woolbright, who played a finger picking style and had recorded for Columbia Records. This made an impression on Scruggs, who said, [...] "He'd sit in the rocking chair, and he'd pick some {{and it was just}} amazing. I couldn't imagine — he was the first, what <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> good banjo player." [...] Scruggs then took up the instrument — he was too small to hold it at first and improvised by setting his brother Junie's banjo beside him on the floor. He moved it around depending on what part of the neck he was playing. [...] After his father's death, Scruggs seemed to take solace in playing music, and when not in school or doing farm chores, spent nearly every spare moment he had practicing. His first radio performance was at age 11 on a talent scout show.|$|E
2500|$|Some thinkers like neuroscientist and philosopher Adina Roskies {{think these}} studies can still only show, unsurprisingly, that {{physical}} {{factors in the}} brain are involved before decision making. In contrast, Haggard believes that [...] "We feel we choose, but we don't". Researcher John-Dylan Haynes adds [...] "How can <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> will 'mine' if I don't even know when it occurred and what it has decided to do?". Philosophers Walter Glannon and Alfred Mele think some scientists are getting the science right, but misrepresenting modern philosophers. This is mainly because [...] "free will" [...] can mean many things: It is unclear what someone means when they say [...] "free will does not exist". Mele and Glannon say that the available research is more evidence against any dualistic notions of free will – but that is an [...] "easy target for neuroscientists to knock down". Mele says that most discussions of free will are now had in materialistic terms. In these cases, [...] "free will" [...] means something more like [...] "not coerced" [...] or that [...] "the person could have done otherwise at the last moment". The existence {{of these types of}} free will is debatable. Mele agrees, however, that science will continue to reveal critical details about {{what goes on in the}} brain during decision making.|$|E
