5|$|In {{its early}} stages, esophageal cancer {{may not have}} any {{symptoms}} at all. When severe, esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus, making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, and whether there are any metastases {{in different parts of}} the body. Esophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of the esophagus. <b>Inserting</b> a stent into the esophagus, or <b>inserting</b> a nasogastric tube, may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water. , the prognosis for esophageal cancer is still poor, so palliative therapy may also be a focus of treatment.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The aim of {{this study}} is to {{demonstrate}} the benefit of design flexibility afforded by the Arcam free-form fabrication process in the direct manufacture of injection mould <b>inserts</b> with complex cooling channel configurations and the process efficiency and quality gains achieved through using such <b>inserts.</b> Design/methodology/approach - The manufacturing process of a flood cooled injection mould <b>insert</b> using the Arcam EBM S 12 layered manufacturing process is presented. The <b>insert</b> is then evaluated against two other <b>inserts</b> (one un-cooled and one traditionally baffle cooled (BC)) in the manufacture of test components, with the temperature of the <b>insert</b> and components recorded. The process conditions were adjusted (reduced cooling time) to increase the core and component temperatures to identify the operational limits of the <b>inserts.</b> Thermal imaging was employed to visualize the thermal distribution within the BC and flood cooled (FC) <b>inserts.</b> Findings - The cooling efficiency of the FC <b>insert</b> was found to be significantly higher than that of the other two <b>inserts,</b> and the homogeneity of the heat distribution of the FC <b>insert</b> was more even than the BC <b>insert.</b> It was possible to manufacture non-deformed components using the FC <b>insert</b> with zero cooling time (ejection immediately after removal of holding pressure), this was not possible with the BC <b>insert.</b> Research limitations/implications - Provides a basis for the development of more efficient and thermally homogeneous <b>inserts</b> through the Arcam EBM process. Practical implications - Provides a technology/process for the manufacture of highly efficient core <b>inserts</b> for injection moulding, offering the industry a competitive advantage through the potential for time and cost savings and higher quality components. Originality/value - This is the first direct comparison of an Arcam EBM manufactured <b>insert</b> with complex cooling geometries against traditionally cooled <b>inserts,</b> particularly novel is the thermal imaging analysis of the cooling efficiency and distribution...|$|R

5|$|During mating, {{the male}} redback {{attempts}} to copulate by <b>inserting</b> {{one of its}} palps into {{the one of the}} female's two spermathecae (sperm storage organs), each of which has its own insemination orifice. It then tries and often succeeds in <b>inserting</b> the other palp into the female's second orifice. The redback spider is one of only two animals known where the male has been found to actively assist the female in sexual cannibalism. In the process of mating, the much smaller male somersaults to place his abdomen over the female's mouthparts. In about two of three cases, the female fully consumes the male while mating continues. Males which are not eaten die of their injuries soon after mating. Sacrifice during mating is thought to confer two advantages to the species. The first is the eating process allows {{for a longer period of}} copulation and thus fertilisation of more eggs. The second is females which have eaten a male are more likely to reject subsequent males. Although this prohibits future mating for the males, this is not a serious disadvantage, because the spiders are sufficiently sparse that less than 20% of males ever find a potential mate during their lifetimes, and in any case, the male is functionally sterile if he has used the contents of both of his palps in the first mating.|$|E
