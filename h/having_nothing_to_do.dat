Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of what will happen, the audience can then better concentrate on {{what is going on in}} the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable to guess what will happen next. For example, Jimmy is going crazy at <b>having</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> when all of a sudden a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.|$|E

500|$|In a January 2007 revision, Bloody Harvest: [...] Revised Report into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China, [...] Kilgour and Matas {{felt that}} the Government of China had {{reinforced}} {{the basis of the}} first report by responding to it in an unpersuasive way, mostly as attacks on Falun Gong. For Kilgour and Matas, such attacks made possible the violation of the basic human rights of Falun Gong practitioners. China identified two factual errors in the first version of the report—one in an appendix, in a caption heading, where Kilgour and Matas placed two Chinese cities in the wrong provinces; the authors dismissed those errors as <b>having</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the analysis or conclusions of their report. In the absence of evidence that would invalidate the organ harvesting allegations — such as a Chinese government registry showing the identity of every organ donor and donation — Kilgour and Matas concluded that the allegations of China's harvesting organs from live Falun Gong practitioners were true and the practice was ongoing. They called for a ban on Canadian citizens traveling to China for transplant operations.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the main}} sources of {{criticism}} of Girard's work comes from intellectuals who claim that his comparison of Judeo-Christian texts vis-à-vis other religions leaves something to be desired.

2500|$|According to comics {{historian}} Coulton Waugh, a 1947 poll {{of newspaper}} readers who claimed they ignored the comics page altogether revealed that many confessed {{to making a}} single exception: Li'l Abner. [...] "When Li'l Abner made its debut in 1934, {{the vast majority of}} comic strips were designed chiefly to amuse or thrill their readers. Capp turned that world upside-down by routinely injecting politics and social commentary into Li'l Abner. The strip was the first to regularly introduce characters and story lines <b>having</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the nominal stars of the strip. The technique—as invigorating as it was unorthodox—was later adopted by cartoonists like Walt Kelly [...] and Garry Trudeau ," [...] wrote comic strip historian Rick Marschall. According to Marschall, Li'l Abner gradually evolved into a broad satire of human nature. In his book America's Great Comic Strip Artists (1989), Marschall's analysis revealed a decidedly misanthropic subtext.|$|E

2500|$|In the Soviet Union, Vladimir Lenin {{was very}} {{impressed}} by Taylorism, which he and Joseph Stalin sought to incorporate into Soviet manufacturing. Taylorism and the mass production methods of Henry Ford thus became highly influential {{during the early years}} of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, [...] " [...] Frederick Taylor's methods have never really taken root in the Soviet Union." [...] The voluntaristic approach of the Stakhanovite movement in the 1930s of setting individual records was diametrically opposed to Taylor's systematic approach and proved to be counter-productive. The stop-and-go of the production process – workers <b>having</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> at the beginning of a month and 'storming' during illegal extra shifts at the end of the month – which prevailed even in the 1980s had nothing to do with the successfully taylorized plants e.g., of Toyota which are characterized by continuous production processes (heijunka) which are continuously improved (kaizen).|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{explained}} that the need to distinguish between economic activities that directly and those that indirectly affect interstate commerce was due to [...] "the concern that we expressed in Lopez that Congress might use the Commerce Clause to completely obliterate the Constitution’s distinction between national and local authority."

2500|$|Because {{there are}} only 63 six-dot {{patterns}} that kantenji can be based on, while there are significantly more elements from which kanji are built in print (for instance, the 214 radicals), each of the kantenji patterns corresponds to several components in print. [...] Most are visually or thematically linked. For example, the kana [...] そ so is the arbitrary basis for the kanji [...] 馬 uma [...] "horse". From there, three kanji for farm animals are derived by adding a [...] "selector" [...] (a pattern with a single lower dot): [...] (馬 + selector 1) 牛 ushi [...] "cattle", [...] (馬 + selector 2) 羊 hitsuji [...] "sheep", and [...] (馬+selector 3) 豚 buta [...] "pig". The kanji 曽 sō, on the other hand, {{is based on the}} same braille pattern, despite <b>having</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the horse radical or its meaning, because it is the historical basis of the kana そ so. [...] Thus [...] (selector 4 + 馬) is 曽 sō. [...] The selectors are generally only used for individual kanji. [...] When 馬, 牛, 羊, 豚, or 曽 used as components of compound kanji in print, all are most commonly written as [...] or [...] in braille.|$|E
2500|$|The form of Solomos' work as {{presented}} {{in its first}} edition {{was the source of}} disappointment, because at that time the work's value could not be appreciated. Polylas in his [...] "Prolegomena" [...] stressed that the major manuscripts of the poems' final version were either lost or destroyed. People assumed that the works may have been stolen by Solomos' servant or by the poet's brother Dimitrios or even that the poet himself destroyed them. Only {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century was it made clear that no more manuscripts existed and that Solomos had not completed his poems. The first attempts to interpret the fragmented nature of the poet's work were mostly based on theories <b>having</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the texts themselves: the difficulty to complete the works was thought to be due to the lack of an appropriate intellectual atmosphere that would provide Solomos with the motivation to complete his works, or due to the lack of an adequate literary tradition that the poet could have followed. The fragmentation of Solomos' work was also attributed to psychological factors, such as the poet's alcoholism, the lack of compositive capability, the negative effects of the 18331838 trial, Solomos' perfectionism or his feeling of dissatisfaction.|$|E
