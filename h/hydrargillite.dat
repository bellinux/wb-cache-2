50|$|Gibbsite is {{also known}} as <b>hydrargillite,</b> named after the Greek words for water (hydra) and clay (argylles). The first {{compound}} named <b>hydrargillite</b> was thought to be aluminium hydroxide, but was later found to be aluminium phosphate; despite this, both gibbsite and <b>hydrargillite</b> are used to refer to the same polymorphism of aluminium hydroxide, with gibbsite used most commonly in the United States and <b>hydrargillite</b> used more often in Europe. In 1930, it was referred to as α-alumina trihydrate to contrast it with bayerite, which was called β-alumina trihydrate (the alpha and beta designations were used to differentiate the more- and less-common forms respectively). In 1957, a symposium on alumina nomenclature attempted to develop a universal standard, resulting in gibbsite being designated γ-Al(OH)3, bayerite becoming α-Al(OH)3, and nordstrandite being designated Al(OH)3. Based on their crystallographic properties, a suggested nomenclature and designation is for gibbsite to be α-Al(OH)3, bayerite to be designated β-Al(OH)3, and both nordstrandite and doyleite are designated Al(OH)3. Under this designation, the α and β prefixes refer to hexagonal, close-packed structures and altered or dehydrated polymorphisms respectively, with no differentiation between nordstrandite and doyleite.|$|E
50|$|Gibbsite, Al(OH)3, {{is one of}} {{the mineral}} forms of {{aluminium}} hydroxide. It is often designated as γ-Al(OH)3 (but sometimes as α-Al(OH)3.). It is also sometimes called <b>hydrargillite</b> (or hydrargyllite).|$|E
50|$|Aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)3, {{is found}} in nature as the mineral {{gibbsite}} (also known as <b>hydrargillite)</b> and its three much rarer polymorphs: bayerite, doyleite, and nordstrandite. Aluminium hydroxide is amphoteric in nature, i.e, it has both basic and acidic properties. Closely related are aluminium oxide hydroxide, AlO(OH), and aluminium oxide or alumina (Al2O3), the latter of which is also amphoteric. These compounds together are the major components of the aluminium ore bauxite.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{methodology}} for characterising grinding kinetics is developed {{based on a}} new criterion,'the residual fraction' to represent {{the performance of a}} grinding process. This is applied to pseudo‐batch grinding of <b>hydrargillite</b> in a fluidised bed opposed jet mill Alpine 100 AFG. It appears to give an adequate representation and a simple mathematical expression for the change in particle size distribution with time. Approximate values of breakage and selection matrices are then calculated on the basis of previous studies, showing that the breakage function is not normalisable over the whole range of particle size. These results are used to propose a fragmentation mechanism for <b>hydrargillite</b> which includes cleavage of the larger particles and destructive breakage of the fine particles...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{mathematical}} treatment, {{based largely}} {{on the work of}} Kapur, has been developed to obtain breakage and selection matrices from batch grinding tests which are valid for the initial period of the process. The method is illustrated using experimental results for the grinding of <b>hydrargillite</b> and carbon in a laboratory scale stirred bead mill for 15 min and it is shown that this restriction still allows application of the method to continuous grinding processes in the mill. The breakage and selection functions determined by the method are shown to give a good representation of the grinding kinetics and to lead to a normalized breakage function...|$|E

According to the obtained data, investigated material is of practical interest as a hardening and mineralizing additive to produce high-strength aluminosilicate ceramics. The strength improving ceramic structures, based on clay and bauxite raw materials mixture, is possible due to the binding of silica, which is released from the structure of kaolinite by aluminum oxide as a product of boehmite and <b>hydrargillite</b> dehydration to the secondary mullite...|$|E

Results lead to rejection of a substitution of cobalt in manganese sites and strongly support a segregation of Co atoms in a locally ordered structure.

The modern {{chemical}} science {{appeared in}} dead spot because of inveterate hypotheses of free ions formation in aqueous solutions. Resistance of water colloidal dispersion systems was {{explained by the}} formation of the electrical double layer (EDL) {{on the surface of the}} dispersed phase due to spontaneous electrolytic dissociation of the molecules of dissolved substances into the ions (cations and anions) and interaction forces of molecular attraction (van der Waals forces) and electrostatic repulsion forces. I believe that in an aqueous solution the substances dissolve to molecules and their spontaneous dissociation into ions doesn?t happen. Dissociation into ions occurs only in the case of chemical reactions. The impetus of the chemical reaction is to destroy the hydrogen bonding of water clusters and formation of highly active radicals and the compounds entering into the conjugate chemical reaction with dissolved gases and other substances. The transfer of electric charges in the aqueous solution is carried out by the mixed proton-electron conductivity, which occurs as a result of the spatial distribution of charges in the supramolecular structures. During the investigation of colloid-dispersed systems it is necessary to take into account the flow of chemical interaction between the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium (water), especially the passage of conjugate chemical reactions between the products of dissociation of water clusters with dissolved substances. As far as spontaneous dissociation of the compounds (including strong electrolytes) into ions in the aqueous solution doesn?t occur, therefore no EDL is formed on the surface of the colloid-dispersed particles. As a result of interaction between the solid particle and clusters of water there is a formation of uncompensated positively charged oxonium ions and negative hydrated hydroxide ions (hydrated electrons) on the surface of solid particles, and electrostatic charges. The latter are formed as a result of Brownian motion of solid particles. In the process of coagulant water purification aluminum sulphate stays in the form of dimers [Al 2 (H 2 O) 24](SO 4) 3, has a charge of 6 + and hydrolyzes to form aluminum dihydroxylsulphate. The latter subsequently undergoes hydrolytic polymerization with formation of tetramers and ring structures of six-core complexes similar to mineral <b>hydrargillite.</b> The link between these structures is carried out by diol groups leading eventually to X-ray amorphous structures of <b>hydrargillite</b> aluminum. In constructing the micellar structures ? micelles (the first building blocks of colloid-dispersed phase) one should take into account the crystal structure of the substance resulting from the condensation process. The process of coagulation in aqueous colloid-disperse systems is physicochemical. ??????????? ?????????? ????? ????????? ? ?????? ????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????????? ????????? ????? ? ?????? ?????????. ????????? ?????? ?????????-?????????? ?????? ????????? ???????????? ???????? ?????????????? ????

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of this work a brief idea was given on what is understood as "clay", on the scientific methods applied {{to the study of the}} matter "clay" as well as on its conception with regard to the edaphic studies. A description is given of the methods of total and natural mechanical analyses which were employed in the agro-geological Department. The work is illustrated by a graphic showing the fractions of the mechanical analysis of the chief great soil types of the State of São Paulo. The fraction clay is then studied by chemical way in the following sequence : 1. ° total chemical analysis, 2. ° partial chemical analysis, 3. ° chemical analysis of the Helmholz layer and 4. ° study of the fixation of the ion Ca+ + in the already mentioned Helmholz layer. The first analysis separates and attacks the hydrated aluminium silicates, the hydrated oxyds of iron and aluminium, manganese, etc. In this analysis the relationship between silica and sesquioxyds was determined. The second type of attack or chemical analysis does not affect the hydrated silicates of aluminium, all others go in dissolution. In this analysis were determined chiefly the sesquioxyds in their free form in the clay complex. For the study of the Helmholz layer, i. e. the determination of changeable ions, solutes of NH 4 Cl N/l, HNO 3 N/ 5, KCl N/l, etc. were used, percolation of these liquids being made through a layer of air dried soil. The relationship between soil and liquid was always 1 : 10. In this analysis, principally the cations K+, Ca++, Mg++, Al+ + +, H+ etc. were determined. With such determinations the calculations of the following values were obtained: S = sum of the changeable bases in ME; T = total value in ME of the sorptive power of the complex in each 100 g dried soil at 110 ° C. and V = percentage of saturation of the complexes with bases. Finally, the qualitative radiographic analysis of the fraction clay was carried out by means of the Debye-Scherrer-Hull method. For these studies the Siemens-Berlin apparatus was used, the transformer of which runs with all 0 - 220 volts 60 -cycle alternating current. The bulb has a copper anti-cathode and is fed by a current of 13 m. A. of intensity and the difference of potential is of 30, 000, 35, 000 and 47, 000 volts. The flash of X-rays goes through the nickel filter in order to free it of the b irradiations which are deleterious. In this way, inciding vertically on the preparation, radiations CuK a with l = 1, 539 A are obtained. The sensible film used was a Lawe-Film-Agfa, with an exposure going from 11 / 2 to 2 hours with 35, 000 V. The chassis has a diameter of 57 mm. More than 500 radiographs of soil samples were taken, of those proceding from all districts of the State, 79 of which are presented in the present work. With this material the different constituents of the clay minerals contained in our soils were known. Thus, in the soils over the Archean geological formation, kaolinite is represented most frequently and abundantly; the <b>hydrargillite</b> also appears commonly. The soils over the Glacial formation contain the same representatives and oscillations as those just mentioned. In the Corum-batai formation, quartz is the most important constituent. The Botucatu formation (lava) is that which gave origin to our legitimate red soils; the mineralogical clay constituents of these soils are : 1. ° large amount of hydrated oxyds of iron up to 35 % of Fe 2 O 3 for each 100 g of soil at 110 ° C.; 2. ° <b>hydrargillite</b> and 3. ° kaolinite. The amount of the latter in the clay complex ranges between 9 and 25 %. The sandy soils existing in the geological formations of lower and upper Baurú bear in their clays the following mineralogical constituents : 1. ° kaolinite, 2. ° montmorrillonitic type (on the upper Baurú only), 3. ° <b>hydrargillite</b> (more common on the lower Baurú) and 4. ° quartz, generally, in small percentages. These researches made it evident that the constituents of the clay fraction of our soils commonly have a small sorptive power related to the cations; it follows hence that they do not show a great power of retention of manure with the exception of the montmorrillonitic type...|$|E
