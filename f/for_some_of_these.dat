5|$|Certain African {{cultural}} groups, {{such as the}} Yoruba and the Igbo of Nigeria, customarily circumcise their infant sons. The {{procedure is}} also practiced by some cultural groups or individual family lines in the Sudan, Zaire, Uganda and in southern Africa. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> groups, circumcision appears to be purely cultural, done with no particular religious significance or intention to distinguish members of a group. For others, circumcision might be done for purification, {{or it may be}} interpreted as a mark of subjugation. Among these groups, even when circumcision is done for reasons of tradition, it is often done in hospitals. It is not clear how many deaths and injuries result from traditional circumcisions which occur outside of hospitals.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{has figured}} {{extensively}} in Polish literature, both in serious critical studies {{of his life}} and music and in fictional treatments. The earliest manifestation was probably an 1830 sonnet on Chopin by Leon Ulrich. French writers on Chopin (apart from Sand) have included Marcel Proust and André Gide; and he has also featured in works of Gottfried Benn and Boris Pasternak. There are numerous biographies of Chopin in English (see bibliography <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these).</b>|$|E

5|$|Seven of the calendrical crescents (red) are {{accompanied}} by other glyphs (green). Guy suggests syllabic readings <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these,</b> based on possible rebuses and correspondences {{with the names of}} the nights in the old calendar. The two sequences of six and five nights without such accompanying glyphs (beginning of line 7, and transition of lines 7–8) correspond to the two groups of six and five numbered kokore nights, which do not have individual names.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} problem that faces reports of transient lunar phenomena {{is that the}} vast majority of these were made either by a single observer or at a single location on Earth (or both). The multitude of reports for transient phenomena occurring at the same place on the Moon could be used as evidence supporting their existence. However, in the absence of eyewitness reports from multiple observers at multiple locations on Earth for the same event, these must be regarded with caution. As discussed above, an equally plausible hypothesis <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> events is that they are caused by the terrestrial atmosphere. If an event were to be observed at two different places on Earth at the same time, this could be used as evidence against an atmospheric origin.|$|E
5|$|When {{published}} in bound volumes, {{the legislative history}} documents are placed in separate volumes {{apart from the rest}} of the materials published by U.S.C.C.A.N. Prior to the 99th Congress, the legislative history materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. contained only a House or Senate report. Since the 99th Congress (1985–87), the legislative history materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. have included the House or Senate report, the committee report, and any presidential signing statements. U.S.C.C.A.N. is considered a more readily accessible source <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> materials, like committee reports, than the originals. As a result, it is recommended by the Bluebook as a citation source in addition to the original document.|$|E

5|$|During {{these early}} {{performances}} Verdi made substantial {{changes to the}} score. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> he altered his manuscript, but for others musicologists have {{had to rely on}} the numerous full and piano scores put out by Ricordi. Further changes were made for the Paris premiere in 1894, which are also inadequately documented. Ricordi attempted {{to keep up with the}} changes, issuing new edition after new edition, but the orchestral and piano scores were often mutually contradictory. The Verdi scholar James Hepokoski considers that a definitive score of the opera is impossible, leaving companies and conductors to choose between a variety of options. In a 2013 study Philip Gossett disagrees, believing that the autograph is essentially a reliable source, augmented by contemporary Ricordi editions for the few passages that Verdi omitted to amend in his own score.|$|E

25|$|Derivation by affix greatly expands a speaker's vocabulary, {{sometimes}} {{beyond what}} they know in their native language. For instance, the English word ommatidium (a single lens of a compound eye) is rather obscure, but a child {{would be able to}} coin an Esperanto equivalent, okulero, from okulo 'an eye' (or perhaps, more precisely, okularero, by first coining okularo for 'a compound eye'). In this way the Esperanto root vid- (see) regularly corresponds to some two dozen English words: see (saw, seen), sight, blind, vision, visual, visible, nonvisual, invisible, unsightly, glance, view, vista, panorama, observant etc., though there are also separate Esperanto roots <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> concepts.|$|E
25|$|Bach {{also wrote}} secular cantatas, for {{instance}} {{for members of}} the Royal-Polish and Prince-electoral Saxonian family (e.g. Trauer-Ode), or other public or private occasions (e.g. Hunting Cantata). The text of these cantatas was occasionally in dialect (e.g. Peasant Cantata) or in Italian (e.g. Amore traditore). Many of the secular cantatas went lost, but <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> the text and the occasion are known, for instance when Picander later published their libretto (e.g. BWV Anh.11–12). Some of the secular cantatas had a plot carried by mythological figures of Greek antiquity (e.g. Der Streit zwischen Phoebus und Pan), others were almost miniature buffo operas (e.g. Coffee Cantata).|$|E
