5|$|In {{biological}} classification <b>humans</b> are animals, a basic point {{which has been}} known for more than 2,000 years. The creationist J. Rendle-Short asserted in Creation magazine that if people are taught evolution they can be expected to behave like animals: since animals behave in all sorts of different ways, this is meaningless. In evolutionary terms, <b>humans</b> are able to acquire knowledge and change their behaviour to meet social standards, so <b>humans</b> behave in the manner of other <b>humans.</b>|$|E
5|$|Paleontology {{also has}} some overlap with archaeology, which {{primarily}} works with objects made by <b>humans</b> and with human remains, while paleontologists {{are interested in the}} characteristics and evolution of <b>humans</b> as organisms. When dealing with evidence about <b>humans,</b> archaeologists and paleontologists may work together– for example paleontologists might identify animal or plant fossils around an archaeological site, to discover what the people who lived there ate; or they might analyze the climate at the time when the site was inhabited by <b>humans.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} alcohol on bees are {{sufficiently}} {{similar to the}} effects of alcohol on <b>humans</b> that honey bees have been used as models of human ethanol intoxication. However, the metabolism of bees and <b>humans</b> is sufficiently different that bees can safely collect nectars from plants that contain compounds toxic to <b>humans.</b> The honey produced by bees from these toxic nectars can be poisonous if consumed by <b>humans.</b> Many <b>humans</b> have eaten toxic honey and become seriously ill as a result.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{has been}} present in <b>humans</b> since antiquity. The {{earliest}} unambiguous detection of M. tuberculosis involves {{evidence of the}} disease in the remains of bison in Wyoming dated to around 17,000 years ago. However, whether tuberculosis originated in bovines, then was transferred to <b>humans,</b> or whether it diverged from a common ancestor, is currently unclear. A comparison of the genes of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in <b>humans</b> to MTBC in animals suggests <b>humans</b> did not acquire MTBC from animals during animal domestication, as was previously believed. Both strains of the tuberculosis bacteria share a common ancestor, which could have infected <b>humans</b> even before the Neolithic Revolution. Skeletal remains show prehistoric <b>humans</b> (4000 BC) had TB, and researchers have found tubercular decay in the spines of Egyptian mummies dating from 3000–2400 BC. Genetic studies suggest TB was present in the Americas from about 100 AD.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} philosophers, {{including}} Elizabeth Anscombe , Jean Bethke Elshtain , Servais Pinckaers, Iris Murdoch, and the Catholic Encyclopedia, have all {{suggested that the}} Kantian conception of ethics rooted in autonomy is contradictory in its dual contention that <b>humans</b> are co-legislators of morality and that morality is a priori. They argue that if something is universally a priori (i.e., existing unchangingly prior to experience), then it cannot also be in part dependent upon <b>humans,</b> who have not always existed. On the other hand, if <b>humans</b> truly do legislate morality, then they are not bound by it objectively, because they are always free to change it.|$|E

5|$|About 10,000years ago the <b>humans</b> who {{inhabited}} the lands around the Mediterranean basin began to domesticate wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept and bred in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses with them. The transmission of viruses from animals to <b>humans</b> can occur, but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to <b>humans.</b> The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to <b>humans</b> and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.|$|E

In two of the independent hybrids that produced <b>human</b> heavy chains, <b>human</b> chromosome 14 was the only <b>human</b> chromosome present in the hybrid cells.

5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, <b>humans</b> have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that <b>humans</b> are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed <b>humans</b> from original sin, but he maintained that <b>humans</b> can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual <b>humans.</b> Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E

40|$|This article takes a {{new look}} at a {{perennial}} question of <b>human</b> rights: how to prevent corporate-related <b>human</b> rights abuses and provide remedies for victims. It argues that transnational corporations require specialized and targeted regulations and laws, and that the conflation of <b>human</b> rights law and international <b>human</b> rights law should be reversed to allow the advancement of other forms of <b>human</b> rights law. It makes two proposals. First, reimagine <b>human</b> rights law and international <b>human</b> rights law as separate categories. Specifically, classify international <b>human</b> rights law as a sub-category of <b>human</b> rights law. This distinction highlights the need to encourage the development of other forms of <b>human</b> rights law, for example, global <b>human</b> rights law and national <b>human</b> rights law.
