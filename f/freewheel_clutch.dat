50|$|The earlier cars used a Rover engine {{from the}} 1948 Rover 75. A four-speed manual {{transmission}} was {{used with a}} column-mounted gearchange at first and floor-mounted unit from September 1953. At first the gearbox only had synchromesh on third and top but it was added to second gear as well in 1953. A <b>freewheel</b> <b>clutch,</b> a traditional Rover feature, was fitted to cars without overdrive until mid-1959, when it {{was removed from the}} specifications, shortly before the London Motor Show in October that year.|$|E
50|$|N502BD {{ran into}} {{problems}} of its own. Early models used a variable speed belt drive system to transfer {{power from the}} engine to the propeller shaft. This was removed from N502BD and it suddenly began exhibiting a serious vibration problem during taxi tests. Experts were called in, and a <b>freewheel</b> <b>clutch</b> and additional bearings added to correct the problem, {{but it was not}} until March 26, 1973 that N502BD flew. From then on the test program seemed to go more smoothly, although this aircraft also suffered two dead stick landings, one from a pinched fuel line occurred while the plane was being observed by the Popular Science author, and another due to metal in a new engine's cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|... the PT6B is a {{helicopter}} turboshaft model, featuring an offset reduction gearbox with a <b>freewheeling</b> <b>clutch</b> and power turbine governor, producing [...] at 4,500 rpm ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{rotor drive}} train in {{helicopters}} uses a <b>freewheeling</b> <b>clutch</b> to disengage the rotors {{from the engine}} {{in the event of}} engine failure, allowing the craft to safely descend by autorotation.|$|R
2500|$|The {{new design}} also {{received}} mechanical upgrades including 30% larger brakes {{than those on}} the previous models. The I8 engine was also increased to [...] and produced [...] Options included a <b>freewheeling</b> <b>clutch</b> to disengage the driveline, {{as well as a}} selective-control automatic clutch.|$|R
50|$|A {{freewheel}} assembly is also {{widely used}} on engine starters {{as a kind}} of protective device. Starter motors usually need to spin at 3,000 RPM to get the engine to turn over. When the key is held in the start position for any amount of time after the engine has started, the starter can not spin fast enough {{to keep up with the}} flywheel. Because of the extreme gear ratio between starter gear and flywheel (about 15 or 20:1) it would spin the starter armature at dangerously high speeds, causing an explosion when the centripetal force acting on the copper coils wound in the armature can no longer resist the outward force acting on them. In starters without the freewheel or overrun clutch this would be a major problem because, with the flywheel spinning at about 1,000 RPM at idle, the starter, if engaged with the flywheel, would be forced to spin between 15,000 and 20,000 RPM. Once the engine has turned over and is running, the overrun clutch will release the starter from the flywheel and prevent the gears from re-meshing (as in an accidental turning of the ignition key) while the engine is running. A <b>freewheel</b> <b>clutch</b> is now used in many motorcycles with an electric starter motor. It is used as a replacement for the Bendix drive used on most auto starters because it reduces the electrical needs of the starting system.|$|E
5000|$|The RF-1 is a {{modification}} of the channel wing concept, that uses a single channel and propeller to eliminate the asymmetrical lift issues with a twin channel wing design. The [...] "channel" [...] is an airfoil-shaped section along the lower arc of the rearward propeller that produces additional lift from the propwash. The RF-1's propeller was completely shrouded, creating a hybrid ducted propeller. Twin engine redundancy is maintained with multiple engines driving a central propeller with <b>freewheeling</b> <b>clutches</b> to allow for an engine failure.|$|R

40|$|The {{propulsion}} {{wheels of}} a manually propelled wheelchair {{are equipped with}} one-way engaging and one-way <b>freewheeling</b> <b>clutch</b> devices which cooperate with races fixed to the wheelchair frame, whereby unwanted backward movement of the wheelchair is prevented and forward movement at all times is enabled. An override mechanism including a spider attached to each hand propulsion ring disables the one-way engaging clutch devices when the wheelchair occupant intentionally moves the propulsion wheels in a backward mode. No controls separate from the manual propulsion wheels are present, assuring the chair occupant constant control of the chair through the hand propulsion rings at all times.

50|$|While the Sonett V4 was {{assembled}} in Sweden, {{nearly the entire}} production was exported to the United States, with a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price of between US$3,200 and US$3,800 (US$ to US$ in today's dollars). In addition to its unusual fiberglass body, the Sonett V4 featured advanced safety features for its day, including a roll bar, three-point seat belts, and high-back bucket seats to protect against whiplash injury. Sonett V4s also sported a few oddities compared to standard American sports cars like e.g. Corvette, such as front wheel drive; a <b>freewheeling</b> <b>clutch</b> that disengaged automatically whenever the accelerator pedal was no longer pressed, and a column-mounted shifter, rather than a typical floor-mounted shifter.|$|R
50|$|The {{tail rotor}} {{is powered by}} the helicopter's main power plant, and rotates at a speed {{proportional}} {{to that of the}} main rotor. In both piston and turbine powered helicopters, the main rotor and the tail rotor are mechanically connected through a <b>freewheeling</b> <b>clutch</b> system, which allows the rotors to keep turning {{in the event of an}} engine failure by mechanically de-linking the engine from both the main and tail rotors. During autorotation, the momentum of the main rotor continues to power the tail rotor and allow directional control. To optimize its function for forward flight, the blades of a tail rotor have no twist to reduce the profile drag, because the tail rotor is mounted with its axis of rotation perpendicular to the direction of flight.|$|R
50|$|In {{mechanical}} or automotive engineering, a <b>freewheel</b> or overrunning <b>clutch</b> is {{a device}} in a transmission that disengages the driveshaft from the driven shaft when the driven shaft rotates {{faster than the}} driveshaft. An overdrive is sometimes mistakenly called a freewheel, but is otherwise unrelated.|$|R
40|$|A {{proof of}} concept of a {{continuously}} variable rotor speed control methodology for rotorcraft is described. Variable rotor speed is desirable for several reasons including improved maneuverability, agility, and noise reduction. However, it {{has been difficult to}} implement because turboshaft engines are designed to operate within a narrow speed band, and a reliable drive train that can provide continuous power over a wide speed range does not exist. The new methodology proposed here is a sequential shifting control for twin-engine rotorcraft that coordinates the disengagement and engagement of the two turboshaft engines {{in such a way that}} the rotor speed may vary over a wide range, but the engines remain within their prescribed speed bands and provide continuous torque to the rotor; two multi-speed gearboxes facilitate the wide rotor speed variation. The shifting process begins when one engine slows down and disengages from the transmission by way of a standard <b>freewheeling</b> <b>clutch</b> mechanism; the other engine continues to apply torque to the rotor. Once one engine disengages, its gear shifts, the multi-speed gearbox output shaft speed resynchronizes and it re-engages. This process is then repeated with the other engine. By tailoring the sequential shifting, the rotor may perform large, rapid speed changes smoothly, as demonstrated in several examples. The emphasis of this effort is on the coordination and control aspects for {{proof of concept}}. The engines, rotor, and transmission are all simplified linear models, integrated to capture the basic dynamics of the problem...|$|R
5000|$|Turbo-Hydramatic 425 (and later 325) was an {{automatic}} transmission developed and produced by General Motors. The THM425 was a derivative of the THM400; most parts directly interchange {{and some others}} will interchange with minor modifications. The internal parts spin the opposite direction in the THM425; the helical angle of the planetary gears is [...] "reversed" [...] and the one-way <b>clutches</b> <b>freewheel</b> in the opposite direction, for example. The THM425 was developed for the 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado and the 1967 Cadillac Eldorado. A lighter-duty transmission known as the THM325 replaced the THM425 in both car lines after the 1978 model year. 1979 and later longitudinal engine front-wheel drive vehicles used the THM325. The THM325 became the THM325-4L with an overdrive added in 1982, but all vehicles using this transmission switched to more-conventional transverse engine mounting in 1986.|$|R
