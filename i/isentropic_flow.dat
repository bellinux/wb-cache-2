40|$|Boundary {{integral}} formulations for aeroacoustics in primitive variables (velocity and pressure), forcompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, {{were developed}} by the author and his collaborators. Such formulations appear much more complicated and cumbersome to use than the classical (scalar) aeroacoustic formulations, such as the FWH equation, the Kirchho formula, and the Howe expressionfor the vorticity-generated sound. This paper explores {{the connection between the}} above scalar formulationsand the proposed primitive-variable formulation, and recasts this into a more manageableform. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, the paper is limited to inviscid <b>isentropic</b> <b>flows.</b> The resultis that, through a series of mathematical manipulations, one obtains that the formulation properlyreduces to the existing ones. The resulting expressions for velocity and pressure are much simplerthan the preceding ones and are surprisingly close to existing ones, in aeroacoustics as well as aerodynamics. Specifically, for incompressible flows, the formulation yields an integral representation for thepressure and one for the velocity. The integral representation for the pressure coincides essentiallywith the Kirchhoff equation for the acoustic pressure, which in turn is equivalent to the FW-H equation. The relationship with the Howe expression for the vorticity-generated sound is also addressed. On the other hand, the resulting rotational-flow expression for the velocity is closely related to thatobtained from the Helmholtz decomposition, as well as that from a non-primitive variable formulationproposed by the author, as a rotational-flow extension of his integral formulation for potential flows. The extension to compressible inviscid <b>isentropic</b> <b>flows</b> is also presented, with some aspects limitedto bodies in uniform subsonic translation.

5000|$|Whenever a gas {{is forced}} through a tube, the gaseous {{molecules}} are deflected by the tube’s walls. If {{the speed of}} the gas is much less than the speed of sound, the gas density will remain constant and the velocity of the flow will increase. However, as {{the speed of the}} flow approximates the speed of sound, compressibility effects on the gas are to be considered. The density of the gas becomes position dependent. While considering flow through a tube, if the flow is very gradually compressed (i.e. area decreases) and then gradually expanded (i.e. area increases), the flow conditions are restored (i.e. return to its initial position). So, such a process is a reversible process. According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, whenever there is a reversible flow, constant value of entropy is maintained. Engineers classify this type of flow as an <b>isentropic</b> <b>flow</b> of fluids. Isentropic is the combination of the Greek word [...] "iso" [...] (which means - same) and entropy. When the change in flow variables is small and gradual, isentropic flows occur. The generation of sound waves is an isentropic process. A supersonic flow that is turned while there is an increase in flow area is also isentropic. Since there is an increase in area, therefore we call this an isentropic expansion. If a supersonic flow is turned abruptly and the flow area decreases, the flow is irreversible due to the generation of shock waves. The isentropic relations are no longer valid and the flow is governed by the oblique or normal shock relations.|$|E

This is shown in Fig. 9.6 assuming a constant reservoir pressure with a decreasing receiver pressure. If the receiver pressure is equal to the reservoir pressure, no flow occurs, represented by curve [...] If pr is slightly less than p_0, the flow is subsonic throughout, with a minimum pressure at the throat, represented by curve B. As the pressure is reduced still further, a pressure is reached that result in M =1 at the throat with subsonic flow throughout the remainder of the nozzle.There is another receiver pressure substantially below that of curve C that also results in <b>isentropic</b> <b>flow</b> throughout the nozzle, represented by curve D; after the throat the flow is supersonic. Pressures in the receiver in between those of curve C and curve D result in non-isentropic flow (a shock wave occurs in the flow) and will be considered in the next section. If pr is below that of curve D, the exit pressure pe is greater than pr. Once again, for receiver pressures below that of curve C, the mass flux remains constant since the conditions at the throat remain unchanged. It may appear that the supersonic flow will tend to separate from the nozzle, but just the opposite is true. A supersonic flow can turn very sharp angles, since nature provides expansion fans that do not exist in subsonic flows. To avoid separation in subsonic nozzles, the expansion angle should not exceed 10°. For larger angles, vanes are used so that the angle between the vanes does not exceed 10°.|$|E
