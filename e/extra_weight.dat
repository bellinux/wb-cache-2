5|$|The {{standard}} {{complement of}} a trireme was 200 men, including 14 marines.

5|$|Improvements to {{artillery}} technology necessitated {{significant changes}} to the fort's structure {{towards the end of}} the 19th century and the start of the 20th. Closely packed casemates of the type built at Coalhouse Fort were vulnerable to new and more powerful types of explosive shells. To alleviate this threat, massive concrete traverses were constructed in the 1880s to isolate each casemate, preventing a shell bursting inside one casemate from affecting its neighbours and causing a cumulative explosion. The construction of concrete gun emplacements on the fort's roof necessitated the installation of circular concrete pillars within the casemates to support the <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> on the roof. The ammunition lifts were also extended to serve the new roof-mounted guns.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} a Dive Coaster can vary {{slightly}} from one to another. Depending on the amusement park's request, one row on the train can seat anywhere from 6 to 10 riders. Stadium seating {{is also used to}} give every rider a clear view. Next, compared to standard Bolliger & Mabillard 4 abreast cars, because of the <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> of each car on a Dive Coaster, the size of the track must be larger than other B models (such as the Hyper Coaster) to support the weight. At the top of the primary vertical drop, a braking system holds the train for 3 to 5 seconds, giving riders a view of the drop ahead before being released into the drop.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need to be for strength, but the <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant <b>extra</b> <b>weight.</b> Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E

50|$|Impression {{tonometry}} (also {{known as}} indentation tonometry) measures {{the depth of}} corneal indentation made by a small plunger carrying a known weight. The higher the intraocular pressure, {{the harder it is}} to push against and indent the cornea. For very high levels of IOP, <b>extra</b> <b>weights</b> can be added to make the plunger push harder. The movement of the plunger is measured using a calibrated scale. The Schiøtz tonometer is the most common device to use this principle.|$|R
