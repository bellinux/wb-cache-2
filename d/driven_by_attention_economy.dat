Nevertheless, instead of being limited to perceive simple features, human and other advanced animals adaptively learn the world into categories and abstract concepts from experiences, imparting the world meanings.

40|$|Human perception, and {{consequently}} behavior, is <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>attention</b> dynamics. In the special case of rivalry, where attention alternates between competing percepts, such dynamics {{can be measured}} and their determinants investigated. A recent study in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, now shows that the origins of attentional rivalry may be quite ancient. Furthermore, individual variation exists {{in the rate of}} attentional rivalry in both humans and flies, and in humans this is under substantial genetic influence. In the pathophysiological realm, slowing of rivalry rate is associated with the heritable psychiatric condition, bipolar disorder. Fly rivalry may therefore prove a powerful model to examine genetic and molecular influences on rivalry rate, and may even shed light on human cognitive and behavioral dysfunction...|$|R

30|$|Intuition {{and some}} simple {{calculations}} {{show that in}} this model the appeal of fines to the firms and other “populist” policies increases relative to their appeal in a setting where anger plays no role (that is λ =  0). To illustrate, imagine that a policy with wage w and transfer T >  0 to the firm is slightly better in terms of total welfare (in a standard model with no anger) to the policy (w, T =  0). In the model with anger, when consumers are angry, the second policy that “beats on the firm” is preferred, since it reduces the amount of anger. This {{is an example of}} a policy that looks bad in a standard model (a bad “populist” policy), but that is potentially welfare enhancing when emotions are taken into account. Although we don’t claim that all of the bad Argentine policies are <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>attention</b> to emotions, we believe that there is at least some truth to the idea that policies that are bad for long run material growth may be optimal when workers (or consumers more generally) are angry at certain business sectors.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 The {{present study}} {{examined}} involuntary attentional bias toward facial emotion expression. Particularly, the study examined two different attentional components for emotional processing, namely, orienting vs. disengagement. A cueing paradigm using two cue presentation times (250 ms and 350 ms) {{was used to}} determine if attention would be involuntarily captured by an irrelevant emotional facial cue. Participants were asked to search for a target emotion face (fearful vs. happy) and identify whether the box containing the target face was red or green. Cue validity effects were observed for both fearful and happy face cues only for the 350 ms cue presentation time; orienting Index scores were consistent with these findings. Thus, attention toward the irrelevant emotional face cues was primarily <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>attention</b> orienting, but only under conditions where there was sufficient time to process the emotions. Disengagement scores at the 250 ms cue presentation revealed that participants had difficulty disengaging their attention from happy facial expression cues when the happy face target appeared in the opposite location of the cue. Taken together, the present findings suggest that both negativity bias and positivity bias occurred involuntarily...|$|R

40|$|Human {{perception}} and cognition processing are not universal. Culture and experience markedly modulate visual information sampling in humans. Cross-cultural studies comparing between Western Caucasians (WCs) and East Asians (EAs) have shown cultural differences in behaviour and neural activities in regarding to {{perception and}} cognition. Particularly, {{a number of}} studies suggest a local perceptual bias for Westerners (WCs) and a global bias for Easterners (EAs) : WCs perceive most efficiently the salient information in the focal object; as a contrast EAs are biased toward the information in the background. Such visual processing bias has been observed {{in a wide range of}} tasks and stimuli. However, the underlying neural mechanisms of such perceptual tunings, especially the temporal dynamic of different information coding, have yet to be clarified. Here, in the first two experiments I focus on the perceptual function of the diverse eye movement strategies between WCs and EAs. Human observers engage in different eye movement strategies to gather facial information: WCs preferentially fixate on the eyes and mouth, whereas EAs allocate their gaze relatively more on the center of the face. By employing a fixational eye movement paradigm in Study 1 and electroencephalographic (EEG) recording in study 2, the results confirm the cultural differences in spatial-frequency information tuning and suggest the different perceptual functions of preferred eye movement pattern as a function of culture. The third study makes use of EEG adaptation and hierarchical visual stimulus to access the cultural tuning in global/local processing. Culture diversity <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> selective <b>attention</b> is revealed in the early sensory stage. The results here together showed the temporal dynamic of cultural perceptual diversity. Cultural distinctions in the early time course are <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> selective <b>attention</b> to global information in EAs, whereas late effects are modulated by detail processing of local information in WC observers...|$|R

Another important component is, nonetheless, needed for action: selection. When one piece of fruit from a branch is being chosen by a monkey, many other pieces are within reach and visible: do the perceptual features of the objects surrounding a target determine interference effects? In humans, reaching to grasp a desired object appears to integrate the motor features of the objects which might become potential targets - a process which seems to be <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> inhibitory <b>attention</b> mechanisms.

40|$|We {{investigated}} 20 -month-olds' (N = 56) gaze following {{by presenting}} toddlers {{with a female}} model that displayed either ostensive or no ostensive cues before shifting her gaze laterally toward an object. The results indicated that toddlers reliably followed the model's gaze redirection after mutual eye contact was established but did so equally reliably after the model's eyes had been made salient nonostensively. Moreover, both conditions elicited gaze following more prominently than when children's attention was initially directed away from the eyes either by specifically accentuating the mouth or by covering the entire face before the model redirected her eyes laterally. These findings suggest that gaze following by toddlers {{is more likely to}} be <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> general <b>attention</b> mechanisms than <b>by</b> their appreciation of somebody else's communicative intent through perceiving eye contact.

Dysfunction in the cholinergic system has been described {{in a number of}} neuropsychiatric disorders. Levels of brain acetylcholine can be pharmacologically manipulated, but {{it is not possible to}} directly measure it in vivo in humans. However, key parts of its biochemical cascade in neural tissue, such as choline, can be measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). There is evidence that levels of choline may be an indirect but proportional measure of acetylcholine availability in brain tissue. In this study, we measured relative choline levels in the parietal cortex using functional (event-related) MRS (fMRS) during performance of a visuospatial attention task, with a modelling approach verified using simulated data. We describe a task-driven interaction effect on choline concentration, specifically <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> contralateral <b>attention</b> shifts.

In particular, our focus is on the kinds of school-based interventions that widespread panic about childhood obesity has generated and their consequences for teachers. We take up this matter by examining how American teachers’ health – and the associated responsibilities and obligations to inspire health among young people – are discursively constructed in legislation, policy documents, and academic articles. Our review and analysis of these texts reveal the presence of three distinct discursive formations: teachers as health role models, teachers as fiscal liabilities, and teachers as instruments of policy compliance. These formations, we argue, suggest a novel and, in some cases, alarming trajectory in school-based obesity policies and interventions...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} an immanent {{critique of}} the concept of <b>attention</b> <b>economy</b> from the perspectives of labour, time, and power. The <b>attention</b> <b>economy</b> is a notion forged by authors belonging to the field of political economy in order to explain the growing value of human attention in societies characterised by post-industrial modes of production. In a world in which information and knowledge become central to the valorisation process of capital, human attention becomes a scarce and hence increasingly valuable commodity. At the same time, the <b>attention</b> <b>economy</b> turns human <b>attention</b> into a form of labour and hence into a new mechanism of capitalist exploitation. Using a series of contemporary readings of Marx (Postone; Lazzarato; Negri and Hardt;Deleuze and Guattari), this thesis develops a critique which does not simply apply Marxist categories to the object of the <b>attention</b> <b>economy,</b> but which uses the <b>attention</b> <b>economy</b> as a concrete object of analysis for reflecting upon both the validity and the importance of Marx‟s critique of political economy for a critique of contemporary capitalism. In other words, this research suggests that, although the <b>attention</b> <b>economy</b> has indeed turned human attention into a new form of labour, it is only through a systematic reinterpretation of Marx‟s categories that this claim can be fully grasped. This reinterpretation comprises two general aspects. Firstly, this thesis argues that {{the way in which the}} <b>attention</b> <b>economy</b> produces and exploits value puts into crisis the traditional category of labour based on an industrial mode of production and which relies solely on abstract labour time as its general equivalent. This calls for an analysis of the labour-value relation from the standpoint of the endogenous transformation of capitalism. Secondly, this thesis suggests that the <b>attention</b> <b>economy</b> operates as a concrete power mechanism which reterritorializes the unleashed productive powers in order to reproduce capital‟s command over human activity. This requires addressing the specific transformations of the diagram of power from disciplinary societies towhat Deleuze has defined as societies of control...|$|R

We present a novel algorithm based on multi-label graph cut for segmenting video into temporally coherent region maps. These maps are used to both stylize video into cartoons and paintings, and measure visual similarity between frames for smooth sequence transitions. The system automatically structures the media collection into a hierarchical representation based on visual content and semantics.

In the past decade, it has been elucidated that K. brevis {{is only one of}} many {{different}} species of the Genus, Karenia, that is found in the world's oceans. There have been major advances in the study of dinoflagellates and their genomics.

These blooms have been documented since the 1800s and occur almost annually along Florida waters. There was increased research activity of HABs in the 1980s and 1990s.

40|$|When {{designing}} {{interventions to}} promote pro-environmental behaviors, practitioners may choose between techniques based on, for example, education, incentives, or social norms. These intervention techniques may, however, target {{different kinds of}} motivation, and therefore differ in their psychological and behavioral implications. The aim of this thesis is to assess norm-based intervention techniques targeting energy conservation. Study I compared a contest-based with a norm-based intervention technique. In two online experiments participants performed pro-environmental tasks (writing energy-saving tips and fictive recycling) while provided with either normative or competitive feedback. Results showed that participants assigned to the contest-based intervention technique engaged more intensively in both tasks. Participants in the norm-based intervention technique showed a tendency for stronger intention for future energy conservation and stronger activation of personal norms for non-targeted pro-environmental behaviors. Study II applied the findings from Study I in two field experiments. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} a norm-based or a contest-based intervention targeting electricity conservation. In the contest, both experiments confirmed an intensive but short-lived effect of electricity conservation. Experiment 1 confirmed increase electricity saving attitudes and more long-term electricity conservation in the norm-based interventions. Results of Experiment 2 did not replicate these findings, but supported a positive spillover effect between electricity and water conservation only in the norm-based intervention. Study III tested a conceptual development of the descriptive norm. Analogous to the separation between injunctive proscriptive and prescriptive norms, we suggest that the descriptive norm can be separated into signaling others’ engagement (a descriptive “donorm”) or disengagement (a descriptive “don’t-norm”). In line with our hypothesis that don’tnorms are more influential, results from three experiments consistently showed that don’tnorms outperformed do-norms (15 %, 10 % and 19 %). However, only the third experiment supported the difference with statistical significance. Study IV examined compliance to prescriptive and proscriptive norms, targeting energy conservation. In a 2 (words: prescription vs. proscription) × 2 (picture: prescription vs. proscription) between-subject design, participants were exposed to prompts promoting energy-saving. Results supported the hypothesis, showing that more participants (88. 1 %) conformed to prompts including both prescriptive and proscriptive content than to prompts including either prescriptions or proscriptions (78. 6 %). A follow-up experiment indicated that these results were <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>attention</b> and reactance. Finally, when asked which prompt participants would use to influence other people to act pro-environmentally, the majority of participants (80. 1 %) chose the prompt that was least effective in our field experiment...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{two types}} of eye {{movements}}: vergence and saccades. Vergence eye movements are responsible for bringing {{the images of the}} two eyes into correspondence, whereas saccades drive gaze to interesting regions in the scene. Control of both vergence and saccades develops during early infancy. To date, these {{two types of}} eye movements have been studied separately. Here, we propose a computational model of an active vision system that integrates these two types of eye movements. We hypothesize that incorporating a saccade strategy <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> bottom-up <b>attention</b> will benefit the development of vergence control. The integrated system is based on the active efficient coding framework, which describes the joint development of sensory-processing and eye movement control to jointly optimize the coding efficiency of the sensory system. In the integrated system, we propose a binocular saliency model to drive saccades based on learned binocular feature extractors, which simultaneously encode both depth and texture information. Saliency in our model also depends on the current fixation point. This extends prior work, which focused on monocular images and saliency measures that are independent of the current fixation. Our results show that the proposed saliency-driven saccades lead to better vergence performance and faster learning in the overall system than random saccades. Faster learning is significant because it indicates that the system actively selects inputs for the most effective learning. This work suggests that saliency-driven saccades provide a scaffold for the development of vergence control during infancy...|$|R
40|$|A 1. Foundation of the model. The {{underlying}} theoretical {{structure of}} the Attention-Situation Awareness (A-SA) model is contained in two modules, one governing the allocation of attention to events and channels in the environment, and the second drawing an inference or understanding of the current and future state of the aircraft within that environment. The first module corresponds roughly to Endsley’s (1995) Stage 1 situation awareness, the second corresponds to her Stages 2 and 3. In dynamic systems, there is a fuzzy boundary between Stage 2 (understanding) and Stage 3 (prediction) because {{the understanding of the}} present usually has direct implications for the future, and both are equally relevant for the task.

Yet {{we know so}} little about how it {{supports}} dynamic group interactions {{that the study of}} real-world social exchanges has been dubbed the “dark matter of social neuroscience” [2]. Recently, various studies have begun to approach this question by comparing brain responses of multiple individuals during a variety of (semi-naturalistic) tasks [3 – 15]. These experiments reveal how stimulus properties [13], individual differences [14], and contextual factors [15] may underpin similarities and differences in neural activity across people. However, most studies to date suffer from various limitations: they often lack direct face-to-face interaction between participants, are typically limited to dyads, do not investigate social dynamics across time, and, crucially, they rarely study social behavior under naturalistic circumstances. Here we extend such experimentation drastically, beyond dyads and beyond laboratory walls, to identify neural markers of group engagement during dynamic real-world group interactions. We used portable electroencephalogram (EEG) to simultaneously record brain activity from a class of 12 high school students {{over the course of a}} semester (11 classes) during regular classroom activities (Figures 1 A– 1 C; Supplemental Experimental Procedures, section S 1).
