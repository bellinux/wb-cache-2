The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E

25|$|We were {{scarcely}} a musket-shot from the shore, when the captain {{pointed out to}} me one of the midshipmen in the boat, of the name of Lockhart, asking me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> his family in Scotland. I answered in the negative, telling him that I had never been in any other service than that of Mrs. Gray. I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me. He was about eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy. His eldest brother, the heir to a considerable estate, had been foolish enough, like so many others, to join the standard of Prince Charles.|$|E
500|$|While {{still part}} of WCW, Konnan was {{contacted}} by talent scout Pat Patterson on New Year's Eve 1990, {{which led to a}} meeting with Vince McMahon, where the initial idea for what became Max Moon was discussed. According to Konnan, [...] "When I was wrestling in Japan, I saw this Japanese anime cartoon robot on TV that shot confetti and fire. [...] asked <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> anybody that could design it." [...] Konnan was given an outfit (purchased by the WWF at the cost of $13,000) bedecked with circuitry and a pyrotechnic gun that shot sparkles into the crowd. Konnan recollected later that the costs associated with the costume led to problems between himself and the promotion right from the start.|$|E

He said, [...] "He has an extra dimension where SpongeBob and Patrick's capacity of play mystifies him, but he's also jealous of it. When {{he tries to}} participate, he just fails utterly because he doesn't believe in it." [...] Staff writer Casey Alexander said, [...] "Squidward is the character I relate to the most. In an exaggerated way, he's the most human character. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> a human like SpongeBob, I probably would react to him like Squidward does". American singer Pharrell Williams, who says he {{is a fan of}} the show, said that [...] "Squidward is my favorite, though. If he was a human, I would hang out with him." ...|$|E

[...] He said that he went home that night, watched the news on television with his children and cried most of the evening. In 1997, he said that Lennon's death made the remaining ex-Beatles nervous that they might also be murdered. He told Mojo magazine in 2002 that Lennon was his greatest hero. In 1981, McCartney sang backup on Harrison's tribute to their ex-bandmate, [...] "All Those Years Ago", which featured Starr on drums. McCartney released [...] "Here Today" [...] in 1982, a song Everett described as [...] "a haunting tribute" [...] to McCartney's friendship with Lennon.|$|E
500|$|Although {{generally}} {{respected by}} London society, the longer Lambert remained there, the more irritable he became.

[...] In answer to one request, to a woman who enquired as to the cost of his coat, he replied [...] "I cannot pretend to charge my memory with the price, but I can put you into a method of obtaining the information you want. If you think proper to make me a present of a new coat, you will then know exactly what it costs". [...] Another interested spectator claimed that since his entrance fee was paying for Lambert's clothing, he had the right to know about it; Lambert replied [...] "Sir, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what part of my next coat your shilling would pay for, I can assure you I would cut out the piece". Lambert calculated in 1806 that a full suit of clothes cost him £20, about £ as of [...]|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1461, Mehmed fitted out a fleet {{comprising}} 200 galleys, and ten warships. At the same time, Mehmed crossed the Dardanelles to Bursa with the Army of Europe and assembled the Army of Asia; one authority estimates the combined force consisted of 80,000 infantry and 60,000 cavalry. According to Doukas, as word of the Sultan's preparations circulated the inhabitants of places as far apart as Lykostomion (or Chilia Veche) {{at the mouth of}} the Danube, Caffa in the Crimea, Trebizond and Sinope, and the islands of the Aegean Sea as far south as Chios, Lesbos and Rhodes, whether or not they had acknowledged his hegemony, all worried they would be his target. This appears to have been Mehmed's intent, for when later asked by a confidante where this force was destined, the Sultan scowled and said, [...] "Be certain <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> one hair of my beard knew my secret, I would pull it out and consign it to the flames." ...|$|E
