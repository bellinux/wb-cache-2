40|$|The {{performance}} of a novel design of a three-section plate-fin heat sink employing channels of stepwise decreasing hydraulic diameter is numerically and experimentally evaluated. Prototype heat-sink and <b>inlet-outlet</b> manifold configurations have been manufactured and characterized, in terms of thermal resistance and induced pressure drop, in a closed fluid loop experimental rig and for flow rates {{in the range of}} 20 - 40 mL/s. The flow development and particularly the secondary flow pattern inside the heat sink are investigated by means of a numerical three-dimensional model. The findings of the study establish that the induced pressure drop, which does not exceed 1000 Pa for the considered flow rates, is primarily attributed to the flow friction in the third-heat sink section, which is of microscale dimensions and the effect of the <b>inlet-outlet</b> manifold system is very small (0. 5 % of the total). In terms of heat transfer, the effect of buoyancy in the first heat-sink section has a beneficial impact on thermal performance maintaining the thermal resistance constant, at a value approximately equal to 0. 015 K/W, regardless of the flow rate of the cooling fluid. Heat transfer is also enhanced in the successive sections due to the effect of contraction-induced longitudinal vortices. Finally, it is proven that the heat sink wall exhibits a more uniform temperature distribution with the decrease of the Reynolds number...|$|E

The proposed method inserts the catalyst in a bath of a strong organic solvent that dissolves oil, soot and fuel residues, cleaning the active surface of the catalyst.

The experimental results based on CO, HC and catalyst <b>inlet–outlet</b> temperature difference measure-ments indicate that after treatment the catalytic efficiency improves considerably (25 per cent) at low idle (750 r/min). The improvement is even higher at high idle (3100 r/min), exceeding 40 per cent.

We apply a network model for multiply connected compartments to analyse {{the influence of}} internal geometry and <b>inlet–outlet</b> positions on {{how much of the}} initial water of each compartment is flushed in time. A complementary experimental study was undertaken to quantify the flushing from 2 × 2, 3 × 3 and 5 × 4 tank configurations by an optical method. The agreement between the predictions and measurements is good. The results show that the flushing in a multi-compartment tank is generally more efficient than perfect mixing. The 95 % reduction is met after three exchange volumes in all cases. The outlet needs to be positioned far from the inlet to reduce bypassing through the tank. These results are finally discussed in the context of international regulations for flushing ballast tanks...|$|E
30|$|Wind {{patterns}} and wind speed control the overall removal of bacteria. Various studies compare wind speeds, direction, {{and also the}} implementation of baffles within the simulated waste stabilization ponds. The factors related to bacteria removal include the direction, speed of wind, {{and the presence of}} baffles, particularly L-shaped baffles, where winds blowing parallel to the <b>inlet–outlet</b> of the pond produce poorer results as compared to the orthogonal orientation of the pond. Nevertheless, the results may vary with increasing wind speeds (Badrot-Nico et al. 2010). Wind coupled with pond geometry can likewise have an impact on treatment performance. For example, in the aerobic layer of facultative ponds the presence of wind leads to vertical mixing and the distribution of dissolved oxygen, bacteria, algae, and BOD. This creates a quality effluent. However, without the wind, algae create a 20  cm-thick layer moving through 50  cm of the pond. This leads to a variable quality effluent (Mara and Pearson 1998).|$|E

If the network is staged, this minimum rises to n 2 − 2 ⌊ n/ 2 ⌋ − 1, while if the network is staged and planar, it rises to n 2 −⌊ n/ 2 ⌋− 2 or n 2 −⌊ n/ 2 ⌋− 1. Furthermore, designing of minimal staged networks is shown to be essentially equivalent to finding an optimal strategy for a certain solitaire game played with matches.

40|$|Synthetic {{turbulence}} for {{inflow conditions}} formulated on a 2 -D plane generally produces unphysically large pressure fluctuations in direct numerical and large-eddy simulations. To reduce such artificial fluctuations a divergencefree method is developed with incompressible flow solvers. The procedure of the velocity-pressure solvers is slightly modified on a vertical plane near (rather than at) the inlet by inserting the synthetic turbulence {{on that plane}} during the procedure. Simple analytic and numerical error estimations are used {{to show that the}} impact of the modified solvers on solution accuracy is small. The final synthetic turbulence satisfies the divergence-free condition. No additional CPU time is required to achieve this condition. The method was tested via simulations of a plane channel flow with Re_tau = 395.

The volume of the expansible membrane is inflated and deflated on a regular cycle by a compressed air or other similar system in the vessel. When the enclosure is placed in a fluid, such as water, and the expansible membrane inside the enclosure is inflated, the volume of the membrane is increased, which results in the water being forced through the outlet hole in the enclosure to propel the vessel. This force will generate a reactive force which will thrust the enclosure and vessel in the opposite direction.

40|$|Two flow {{problems}} {{relevant to}} fuel cell modeling are simulated with the lattice-Boltzmann (LB) approach. The {{first is a}} 3 D viscous flow through a section of serpentine channel {{and the second is}} a 2 D channel filled or partially filled with porous medium. In the first case, attention is given to the implementation details such as <b>inlet–outlet</b> boundary conditions, nonuniform grid, and forcing. It was shown that the flow pattern and pressure distribution depends sensitively on the flow Reynolds number as the flow Reynolds number is increased from 10 to 1000. There also appears to be some evidence that the transition to a turbulent flow occurs at Reynolds number on the order of 1000. In the second case, the effects of multiple time scales and interface between the porous medium and clear channel are considered. It was shown that, in order to obtain correct results at the interface or near the boundary, the physical time scales of the problem must be kept larger than the lattice time. This can be achieved by using a small particle velocity in the LB scheme. © 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
