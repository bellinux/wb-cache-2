[...] Later, at an arranged press meeting, a reporter asked, [...] "Did you kill the President?"

2500|$|The lyrical {{themes of}} Currents centre on {{personal}} transition and growing older. Parker's lyrics {{on the album}} are entirely autobiographical. His vocals are clearer and less affected than in prior Tame Impala releases, which is partially owed to him having more pride in his lyrics; he said he {{hoped it would be}} easy for listeners to understand them. Parker considered the primary theme of the album to be a [...] "deep feeling of transition in your psyche," [...] or, in a broad sense, fully entering adulthood. He began learning about the concept of the Saturn return halfway through the recording process, which explained his feelings of reflection. He said, [...] "I was halfway through making the album when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and it gave what I was doing a lot more meaning; suddenly things made a lot more sense." [...] Accordingly, on the album his reaction to transition is acceptance, exemplified by the opening song, [...] "Let It Happen". Parker also felt buying the home where he recorded Currents [...] "really changed my perspective about where I saw myself, like a place that I belonged." ...|$|E

After seeing the movie, I didn’t really DO anything with it until {{we were working on}} “We Are The Others.” But the basic idea of the lyrics was there. It was just supposed to be a song about “we are the others” and a feeling of togetherness. On the one hand, being proud of whoever you are, whether you divert from the norm in whatever way you divert from the norm. But on the other hand, it is also kind of a song for “others”. We just wanted a song about acceptance.|$|R

5000|$|Ghomeshi {{thought the}} {{material}} he showed to his CBC bosses on 23 October — reportedly {{a video of}} him at a BDSM club, evidence of consensual stuff (plus {{all of the evidence}} he was pretty sure I had so he had to come clean with it) — would exonerate him {{in the eyes of the}} CBC and that they would stand by him [...] "against this podcaster who had clearly signaled that an expose was on the way". But heres the thing — I wasnt talking about Jian on that 20 October podcast. I was talking about another CBC personality Terry Milewski who Glenn Greenwald says sat on Snowden leaks about spying in Canada for months on end instead of reporting them. That was my [...] "monster story"! The Jian story had been sitting on ice. The Star wouldnt run it because my sources were all anonymous; Vice wouldnt run it for the same reason. It was not imminent, it was not gonna drop. Heres why it did. Right after Jian got fired, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> from a source and tweeted the news and I suggested that I knew why he was fired, which I did. Well, he took that as another clear sign from me that I was about to unload everything I had on Canadalandshow.com, which he though I had previously promised on the show. And so he posted that Facebook confessional, warning his legions of fans about the [...] "smear job that was coming from this freelance writer guy and the jilted ex". And once he did that, once he went public, the Star could, too. Before Jians Facebook post, the Star editor-in-chief Michael Cookefelt that our investigation was un-publishable (I strongly disagreed with that position, by the way), but afterwards it was a no-brainer — he had to run it. Because Jian published — we published. If he hadnt — we wouldnt have. Jesse Brown on the circumstances surrounding the Toronto Stars decision to publish his and Kevin Donovans accusatory investigative report on Jian Ghomeshi Brown received his biggest exposure in late October 2014, teaming up with the Toronto Star investigative reporter Kevin Donovan to report after months of investigation on allegations of non-consensual violence committed by the CBC radio and television host Jian Ghomeshi against various women.|$|E

I thought that you {{probably}} would try but someone said there weren’t any telephones except in town and since you were restricted didn’t think that you’d be able to. Not sure what time you called. Mrs. M said about an hour after I’d left. That must have been about six your time. About then Doris + Betty Jo + I were waiting for Julie to get ready. I thought about you all day + night, honey. Didn’t find out about your calling until this morning. It’s hard to write because I’m lying {{out in the back}} yard in the sun trying to get a suntan. Probably won’t get anything more than sunstroke. Lord it sure is hot. Golly, darling, I wish you’d get through that fool course in ten days. That would be marvelous. But it will undoubtedly pour or snow or something. How many hours do you have to have before they send you back to Craig? You really should get overseas pay. There should be something done about that. Every time the sun goes behind the cloud I write some more. Well, it’s too hot for me. Had to go sit on the front porch in the shade. It’s nice and cool here. Let’s see, where was I – oh, yes, I don’t suppose there’s much chance of your getting back in ten days? Golly, that would be marvelous. I just don’t want to think about it. Last night after the movies, we went to see “Murder my Sweet”. We went to the hotel. Just on the change that there might be save mail + sure enough. I almost died. There were two letters from you. What a surprise. Well, honey loads of things have been happening to me lately. Golly, I’ve met more people! Can’t remember any of their names but they were all so nice. Julie has a boyfriend named George Harvey + what a car. It’s almost a block long, light green “convertible” of course. Gee, it’s sharp. We’ll have to get a car, honey. Oh, if we go home on your leave, we could get one there + the ration board would give us enough gas to drive back to your next Post. Cars down here are awfully expensive. Golly, talk about an arm + a leg. They want the whole body! You were saying they send out a man to get the papers. That reminded me – Since we left Pelham I haven’t seen more than two papers. Haven’t the slightest idea how the war is going. Yesterday saw “Blondie” but outside of that I’m worse off than you are. I’m very contented here in silence. Like it a lot and would be awfully happy if you were here. It’s really a nice place. Of course the food is supposed to be awful but I didn’t think it was so bad. All the Officers say the food in the Officer’s Club is lousey [sic]. They bring their lunch. It’s a riot. Everyone says {{you should be able to}} live off the Post, honey, as long as you pay for your BOQ + get back in time. You’re supposed to fire 3, 000 rounds in the 17 days? Golly, darling, you’ll be there forever at that rate. How many have you fired so far. You’d have to fire 300 rounds a day to get through in ten days. Guess there’s not much chance of that. How long does it take to shoot a hundred? It sounds like hard work but probably is fun. Gee, I wish you’d hurry home. Oh, do they go by the number of hours you fly down there? How soon do you think you’ll be home? Seventeen days? How’s the weather? Golly, darling, I miss your not coming home at nights + getting up at those ungodly hours of the night to get you back to camp on time. Your pajama tops are going to be worn out soon. You’d better hurry home if you ever want to wear them again. You’ve probably gotten my letter by now. You must have since you called here telling you where I’m staying. Mrs. M. has been real nice to me + if her daughter-in-law doesn’t come we’ll probably stay here. I’d rather get the apartment across the street if possible because we’d have a private bath + we’d be more alone there. That Lt. sure looks sharp on the envelope. I love addressing envelopes now- writing Lt. + Mrs. That I like. Golly darling in another forty minutes we’ll have been married eight days! Still don’t think we should count until you get back because we’re not together + haven’t been long enough to make it fair. We’ll have to start all over again. How are Tom + D. A. ? Does Tom still like Janet? Haven’t heard him speak of her in ages. Say hello to them both for me. I’m beginning to have trouble- meeting people. They’re beginning to conflict. They all want to do something at the same time. Like tonight. Supposed to see Julie, Bettie Jo + Doris + the girls next door. It’s going to be confusing. Last night the girls next door were out with two captains. One was from N. Y. + the other knew Dick Mullineaux- He’d been in China with him. Did you know Dick? He was reported missing over Jap territory last June, I think. It seemed so funny to see someone who knew where Pelham was. I was really amazed. One of the captains- think his name was Cook- instructs the French. Anyway I had been telling one of the girls that you could speak a little French or something so she told the captain. He wanted to know your name but I wouldn’t tell him. He said they need French instructors. All you have to do is say one word with a slight accent + you were it. But I told him you wouldn’t like it + probably couldn’t speak French anymore. I know you probably wouldn’t want to be an instructor because you want to go over so much. Didn’t know what to say but told him you wouldn’t like it. Would you? I’d love it- But I know you sorta want to go over. Of course you really could do much more as an instructor than you could as a pilot overseas. Because as an instructor you’d be able to train several men to fight + as a pilot overseas there’d be just you. Oh well, I suppose you know all that. But you did say you’d like to try it. I’d like you to be an instructor here now that I know so many people. Besides, I could be with you longer but of course you are the one who counts most about that. All this is just day dreaming. But you should be used to the way I ramble by now. Golly, darling, I’ve gotten a sunburn. You should see me. The front of my legs are real red but the backs are exactly the same. At least I look healthy from the front. Gee, I love you so, honey. It’s so awful to have to be away from you now, Judd. I miss you more + more every day. What have you been doing? Anything unusual. Wonder how long you’ll be stationed around here, darling. Hope you’re not sent over for years. Gee, honey, does it seem as though we’d been married for eight days to you? It just isn’t fair. It seems as though you’d been away for years. How long do you think you’ll be there? If you’re going to come home early let me know if possible so that I can wash my hair + look half way decent. Oh, honey, I wish that I were here when you called. Let me know if you have any plants for calling again so that I’ll be here. Golly I was so disappointed when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Didn’t think you knew where I was yet. Well, darling, I guess I’d better get ready to go to town to eat. I love you so much, Judd. More than I’d ever dreamed possible. It’s wonderful to be so much in love but horrible to be separated. Well, darling, be a good little boy + hurry up + finish everything down at Eglin + come back to me real quick. You’re so wonderful, Judd. I love you so much, honey. Being in love with you is the nicest thing that ever happened to me. Golly, I’m glad we’re married. Oh, are you getting rested? What do you do when you don’t fly? Try to catch up on your sleep, honey, I just don’t enjoy going to bed anymore. It’s terrible. Golly, I’ll be glad when you’re back again. Every minute we’re apart seems so long. There’s four girls around here that I met today + they’re all going to have baby. The people are awful here- If you don’t have a dog or a baby they won’t rent you a room. Great isn’t it. Well, darling, I hope you’re back real soon. I miss you so. You’re so sweet, darling and I love you. Wish you were here now. Miss your arms + being kissed + you. It shouldn’t be long now, honey, but it will seem like a million years. I love you + will love you always- more + more every day. Your devoted wife, Dottie P. S. I love you, my darling husband- I can’t believe it. Golly especially when you’re so far away! I love you. [Translation ends...|$|E

Here we’ve almost been married a whole week in three more hours. Golly, darling, what a week it’s been, too. The first part was wonderful. Well, I’ve been kept pretty busy all week but nothing can take your place, honey. Everyone I meet just makes me miss you more because I always think {{no matter how good}} a time I could have it would be so much better if you were here. Everyone thinks you’re real cute and they’re so right. Guess I shocked Mrs. Moseley by not going to church. Golly, {{everyone}} is so religious down here. They’re all heads of something in the choir + teach Sunday school The girls next door are real cute blondes. Had dinner over there last night. Oh, don’t worry about my not eating. I’m eating like a little pig. I’ll be like a baby elephant {{by the time you get}} back. I love Southern food. It’s so good. Today Julie + Betty Jo asked me for lunch. They eat a real big meal at lunch here + suppers not small by any means. We had hot biscuits last night + I must have eaten ten. They were so good. Every once in a while I can’t understand people. When they start talking fast but mostly I like their accent. They have some queer expressions, down here- all the girls “get tickled” when something’s funny. It sure is funny the different expressions that everyone uses. The girls next door are awfully nice + want me to do something with them today but since Julie insisted I stay there for lunch I don’t know how I’ll do it. That’s what always happens. I get involved in more things, honey. Las night was another mess. Nothing important though. Gee, darling, I’m so lonesome every night sleeping by myself. That would sound bad if we weren’t married. But golly, I almost feel as if we aren’t. How’s the weather down there- I sure hope it’s decent and that everyone finished before the 17 days. It would be awful if you had to stay there longer. That I won’t think about. Going to eat breakfast. Wait a sec. How do you like Eglin, honey? Like “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo? Everyone says Aux Co. is the worst place in the world to be. We certainly are lucky. It’s awful how long seventeen days can be. It already seems way over a year. I’ll have to write to everyone soon. Oh, don’t forget to send me Nanny’s address so that I can write her. How do you like being a Lieutenant now, honey? Still [?] as proud? Golly, I wish you’d get back here so that we could be together. Did I tell you that some fool maid over at the hotel threw away my box for Mr. O’Leery + Pinkie? And she also threw away our book. (Together reminded me of the sense of oneness). You should have seen me trying to move with all the junk I had. Your B- 4 bag is really marvelous. We’ll really need a foot locker for me. That will help loads. If it doesn’t take a year to get there. Monday My darling husband, Honey, I’m so mad that I wasn’t home when you called last night.

How long does it take to shoot a hundred? It sounds like hard work but probably is fun. Gee, I wish you’d hurry home. Oh, do they go by the number of hours you fly down there? How soon do you think you’ll be home? Seventeen days? How’s the weather? Golly, darling, I miss your not coming home at nights + getting up at those ungodly hours of the night to get you back to camp on time. Your pajama tops are going to be worn out soon. You’d better hurry home if you ever want to wear them again. You’ve probably gotten my letter by now. You must have since you called here telling you where I’m staying. Mrs. M. has been real nice to me + if her daughter-in-law doesn’t come we’ll probably stay here. I’d rather get the apartment across the street if possible because we’d have a private bath + we’d be more alone there. That Lt. sure looks sharp on the envelope. I love addressing envelopes now- writing Lt. + Mrs. That I like. Golly darling in another forty minutes we’ll have been married eight days! Still don’t think we should count until you get back because we’re not together + haven’t been long enough to make it fair. We’ll have to start all over again. How are Tom + D. A. ? Does Tom still like Janet? Haven’t heard him speak of her in ages. Say hello to them both for me. I’m beginning to have trouble- meeting people. They’re beginning to conflict. They all want to do something at the same time. Like tonight. Supposed to see Julie, Bettie Jo + Doris + the girls next door. It’s going to be confusing. Last night the girls next door were out with two captains. One was from N. Y. + the other knew Dick Mullineaux- He’d been in China with him. Did you know Dick? He was reported missing over Jap territory last June, I think. It seemed so funny to see someone who knew where Pelham was. I was really amazed. One of the captains- think his name was Cook- instructs the French. Anyway I had been telling one of the girls that you could speak a little French or something so she told the captain. He wanted to know your name but I wouldn’t tell him. He said they need French instructors. All you have to do is say one word with a slight accent + you were it. But I told him you wouldn’t like it + probably couldn’t speak French anymore. I know you probably wouldn’t want to be an instructor because you want to go over so much. Didn’t know what to say but told him you wouldn’t like it. Would you? I’d love it- But I know you sorta want to go over. Of course you really could do much more as an instructor than you could as a pilot overseas. Because as an instructor you’d be able to train several men to fight + as a pilot overseas there’d be just you. Oh well, I suppose you know all that. But you did say you’d like to try it. I’d like you to be an instructor here now that I know so many people. Besides, I could be with you longer but of course you are the one who counts most about that. All this is just day dreaming. But you should be used to the way I ramble by now. Golly, darling, I’ve gotten a sunburn. You should see me. The front of my legs are real red but the backs are exactly the same. At least I look healthy from the front. Gee, I love you so, honey. It’s so awful to have to be away from you now, Judd. I miss you more + more every day. What have you been doing? Anything unusual. Wonder how long you’ll be stationed around here, darling. Hope you’re not sent over for years. Gee, honey, does it seem as though we’d been married for eight days to you? It just isn’t fair. It seems as though you’d been away for years. How long do you think you’ll be there? If you’re going to come home early let me know if possible so that I can wash my hair + look half way decent. Oh, honey, I wish that I were here when you called. Let me know if you have any plants for calling again so that I’ll be here. Golly I was so disappointed when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Didn’t think you knew where I was yet. Well, darling, I guess I’d better get ready to go to town to eat. I love you so much, Judd. More than I’d ever dreamed possible. It’s wonderful to be so much in love but horrible to be separated. Well, darling, be a good little boy + hurry up + finish everything down at Eglin + come back to me real quick. You’re so wonderful, Judd. I love you so much, honey. Being in love with you is the nicest thing that ever happened to me. Golly, I’m glad we’re married. Oh, are you getting rested? What do you do when you don’t fly? Try to catch up on your sleep, honey, I just don’t enjoy going to bed anymore. It’s terrible. Golly, I’ll be glad when you’re back again. Every minute we’re apart seems so long. There’s four girls around here that I met today + they’re all going to have baby. The people are awful here- If you don’t have a dog or a baby they won’t rent you a room. Great isn’t it. Well, darling, I hope you’re back real soon. I miss you so. You’re so sweet, darling and I love you. Wish you were here now. Miss your arms + being kissed + you. It shouldn’t be long now, honey, but it will seem like a million years. I love you + will love you always- more + more every day. Your devoted wife, Dottie P. S. I love you, my darling husband- I can’t believe it. Golly especially when you’re so far away! I love you. [Translation ends...|$|E
