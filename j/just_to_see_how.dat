500|$|She {{moved into}} feature film acting cautiously, {{choosing}} deliberately small roles to begin with. In November 2005, {{after going through}} an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to New Mexico to film a single scene in the 2007 film, The Flock. She played Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside Claire Danes and Richard Gere. Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes. On her role in The Flock, Lavigne said, [...] "I did that <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> it was and to not jump into [...] too fast". The Flock was not released in American theatres, {{and because it was}} not released in foreign markets until late 2007, it is not considered Lavigne's debut. The film made $7million in the foreign box office.|$|E
2500|$|The Song Remains The Same {{is not a}} great film, but there's {{no point}} in making excuses. [...] It's just a {{reasonably}} honest statement of where we were at that particular time. [...] It's {{very difficult for me to}} watch it now, but I'd like to see it in a year's time <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> it stands up.|$|E

2500|$|After the 2009 Reading Festival, Radiohead did {{not perform}} [...] "Creep" [...] again until 2016, when they {{performed}} it several times on tour for their ninth studio album, A Moon Shaped Pool. After a fan spent the majority of a concert shouting for it, the band decided to play it to [...] "see what the reaction is, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> it feels.'" [...] O'Brien said of the song in 2017: [...] "It's nice {{to play for the}} right reasons. People like it and want to hear it. We do err towards not playing it because you don't want it to feel like show business. But we started throwing it in last year." [...] In the same interview, Yorke said: [...] "It can be cool sometimes, but other times I want to stop halfway through and be like, 'Nah, this isn't happening.'" [...] Later that year, the band performed the song during the encore of their headline performance at the Glastonbury Festival.|$|E

6000|$|Trot came in <b>just</b> then <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> her {{dear friend}} was located.

5000|$|Demidova's {{performance}} as Electra in Sophocles' Electra which premiered in Athens, Greece, in 1992, {{happened to be}} her final one under Lyubimov.

[...] "I <b>just</b> refused <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> could a pupil betray their master," [...] she later explained.
