5|$|As McKinley's {{professional}} career progressed, so too did his social life blossom as he wooed Ida Saxton, {{the daughter of}} a prominent Canton family. They were married on January 25, 1871, in the newly built First Presbyterian Church of Canton, although Ida soon joined her husband's Methodist church. Their first child, Katherine, was born on Christmas Day 1871. A second daughter, Ida, followed in 1873, but died the same year. McKinley's wife descended into a deep depression at her baby's death and her health, never robust, grew worse. Two years later, in 1875, Katherine died of typhoid fever. Ida never recovered from her daughters' deaths; the McKinleys had no more children. Ida McKinley developed epilepsy around the same time and thereafter disliked her husband's leaving her side. He remained a devoted husband and tended to his wife's medical and <b>emotional</b> <b>needs</b> {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

40|$|Currently {{the design}} of a driver seat for city car is mainly {{concerned}} with the basic functional needs, and design style is decided by the designer’s subjective which doesn’t represent the driver desire. This requires certain method to answer the complexity of driver desire (<b>emotional</b> <b>need),</b> because driver perceptions and preferences are hard to define and calculate. Therefore, kansei engineering is employed to capture driver perceptions and preferences of car seat. From the perspective of ergonomics and psychology, with the driver’s <b>emotional</b> <b>need</b> as starting point, we transform the obscure <b>emotional</b> <b>need</b> into design elements, which are used to guide the design driver seat. Then used semantic differential method to make subjective evaluation and conjoint analysis method to extract driver preferences for functional features that meets the driver <b>emotional</b> <b>need.</b> Anthropometric measurements were also hired for fulfill ergonomic parameters. This study proposes a tangible design methods through <b>emotional</b> <b>need</b> for developing driver seat of national electric car (SmarT). The study result shows that separated head rest, contoured backrest, standard cushion, woven polyester material, plain tone and combination features was the most preferred by driver. ...|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{people use}} the words “fad” and “trend” interchangeably. Fads can be {{distinguished}} from trends in three ways: their reason for rise, their incubation period and life span, and their scope. Trends have explainable rises, and are driven by functional needs. They reflect deep-rooted human desires and needs, while fads are generally driven by the <b>emotional</b> <b>need</b> to purchase. This <b>emotional</b> <b>need</b> can come from the hype that surrounds the product. Trends rise slowly over time, but fads’ popularity spike quickly and they end up dying out just as quickly. Fads might last for just weeks or months. Scope is also a factor. A trend encompasses several brands and products which can reach a large variety of people. A fad typically encompasses just one brand, or product, with limited appeal and a narrow scope.|$|R

50|$|Nietzsche concludes {{the essay}} by {{identifying}} {{a need to}} have art along with knowledge. Art is necessary because it adds emotion and purpose to society.

40|$|Introduction: There {{has been}} a recent {{increase}} in interest in research into the <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>needs</b> {{of children and adolescents}} with intellectual disability. The field has tended to focus on the association between <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>needs</b> and child characteristics. Little {{attention has been paid to}} the potential importance of social context. Method: Cross-sectional survey of teacher-reported <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>needs</b> among 386 South Asian children and 118 Black children in a deprived urban conurbation. Results: The results suggested that: (i) teachers reported higher rates of <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>needs</b> among Black (when compared with South Asian) children; (ii) increased rates of <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>needs</b> were generally associated with older child age, lower child ability, the absence of sensory impairments and male gender; and (iii) neighbourhood deprivation was associated with variation in <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>need</b> differently for the two ethnic groups. For Black children, increased deprivation was associated with increased need. However, for South Asian children increased deprivation was associated with decreased need. DiscussionResults are discussed in relation to 'group density effects' which may reflect the potentially moderating effects of social support on the relationship between socioeconomic deprivation and mental health...|$|R
50|$|A neophile is {{distinct}} from a revolutionary in that anyone might become a revolutionary if pushed far enough by the reigning authorities or social norms, whereas neophiles are revolutionaries by nature. Their intellectual abhorrence of tradition and repetition usually bemoans a deeper <b>emotional</b> <b>need</b> for constant novelty and change. The meaning of neophile approaches and is not mutually exclusive to the term visionary, but differs in that a neophile actively seeks first-hand experience of novelty rather than merely pontificating about it.|$|R
25|$|Parker and Lydia Cabot {{married in}} 1837, but the union was rocky at first due to {{environmental}} stresses and incompatibilities, {{and both were}} saddened to have no children. In 1840 he sought emotional release {{in the company of}} a neighboring woman, Anna Blake Shaw, who had a similar theology and temperament to his own, but the friendship was by all accounts not sexual. This attachment naturally increased problems at home, where he may have found it difficult to meet the <b>emotional</b> <b>needs</b> of his wife.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{traditional}} attachment theory {{holds that}} the provision of a safe and predictable environment and caregiver qualities such as sensitivity, responsiveness to children's physical and <b>emotional</b> <b>needs</b> and consistency, support the development of healthy attachment. Therapy based on this viewpoint emphasizes providing a stable environment and taking a calm, sensitive, non-intrusive, non-threatening, patient, predictable, and nurturing approach toward children. Further, as attachment patterns develop within relationships, methods to correct problems with attachment focus on improving the stability and positive qualities of the caregiver-child interactions and relationship. All mainstream interventions with an existing or developing evidential foundation focus on enhancing caregiver sensitivity, creating positive interactions with caregivers, or change of caregiver if that is not possible with existing caregivers. Some interventions focus specifically on increasing caregiver sensitivity in foster parents.|$|E
25|$|Global {{justice is}} the {{paramount}} to global security, because injustice {{can lead to}} feelings of anger, humiliation, and alienation, which can undermine human dignity. Al-Rodhan argues that humans are primarily driven by emotional self-interest and that protecting humans’ <b>emotional</b> <b>needs</b> is fundamental to human well-being and human dignity. When people {{feel that they have}} been the victim of unjust decisions, they may try and seek justice by less conventional means such as violence. This, in turn, can promote insecurity. Therefore, justice and not just military power, is essential to maintaining global security. Some obstacles might however arise. Al-Rodhan identifies the disparity in power that exists between states in the current global order as a major obstacle in achieving global justice. Calls for greater global justice are thus likely to continue from disadvantaged societies because they often feel that they are unjustly subjected to the rules set by more powerful players. However, dominant states that benefit from the current status quo are unlikely to want to alter established institutions or governance structures.|$|E

[...] In further remarks, Ahmad said he was not sure when the airline could start repairing its image, but that the airline was adequately insured to cover the financial loss stemming from Flight 370's disappearance. In China, where the majority of passengers were from, bookings on Malaysia Airlines were down 60 percent in March.|$|E

Film scholar Wimal Dissanayake agrees that the film brought [...] "a new stage in the evolving dialectic between violence and social order" [...] to Indian cinema. Film scholar M. Madhava Prasad states that Jai and Veeru represent a marginalised population that is introduced into conventional society. Prasad says that, through the elements of revenge included in the plot {{and the application of}} Jai and Veeru's criminality for the greater good, the narrative reflects reactionary politics, and the audience is compelled to accept feudal order. Banerjea explains that though Jai and Veeru are mercenaries, they are humanised by their <b>emotional</b> <b>needs.</b> Such dualism makes them vulnerable, in contrast to the pure evil of Gabbar Singh.|$|E

500|$|Ainsworth's {{narrative}} records {{showed that}} infants avoided the caregiver in the stressful Strange Situation Procedure {{when they had}} a history of experiencing rebuff of attachment behaviour. The infant's needs were frequently not met and the infant had come to believe that communication of <b>emotional</b> <b>needs</b> had no influence on the caregiver. Ainsworth's student Mary Main theorized that avoidant behaviour in the Strange Situational Procedure should be regarded as [...] "a conditional strategy, which paradoxically permits whatever proximity is possible under conditions of maternal rejection" [...] by de-emphasising attachment needs. Main proposed that avoidance has two functions for an infant whose caregiver is consistently unresponsive to their needs. Firstly, avoidant behaviour allows the infant to maintain a conditional proximity with the caregiver: close enough to maintain protection, but distant enough to avoid rebuff. Secondly, the cognitive processes organising avoidant behaviour could help direct attention away from the unfulfilled desire for closeness with the caregiver—avoiding {{a situation in which the}} child is overwhelmed with emotion ('disorganized distress'), and therefore unable to maintain control of themselves and achieve even conditional proximity.|$|E

The [...] "gossip" [...] is a soap opera role that author Christine Geraghty has described as [...] "crucial to the audience's engagement with a serial and provides both {{a source of information}} and a means of speculation for the viewer." [...] She asserts that a fundamental aspect of British soap is the idea of supporting members of community, based on the sharing of intimate knowledge, allowing [...] "practical and <b>emotional</b> <b>needs</b> to be met" [...] within the enclosed community. However, according to Geraghty, there is nevertheless [...] "an unease about the price paid for such support and an acknowledgement of the fine-line between neighbourliness and nosiness. The 'gossip' personifies this unease and though her task of passing on information and ferreting out problems is crucial to the community, she [...] is frequently the butt of mockery and criticism [...] The avidity with which Dot Cotton seeks out news is the subject of some embarrassment to her more restrained neighbours but the exchange of information she provides is essential if the community is to provide support to its members [...] the very process of exchanging information makes her an essential yet mistrusted figure." ...|$|E
