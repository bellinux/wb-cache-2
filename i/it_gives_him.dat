He wrote that [...] "Unrequited" [...] "isn't {{a very good}} episode" [...] of the series, {{but that it is}} [...] "a potent one all the same" [...] due to its [...] "great ideas" [...] that are {{unfortunately}} never expanded upon. VanDerWerff felt that the episode's biggest problem was that it started in media res and revealed the episode's conclusion, writing [...] "it's a pretty great starting point for an episode. Instead, it's actually the endpoint". Despite the negativity towards the plot, he wrote that the entry was [...] "a good episode for Skinner" [...] in that <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> a mission and alludes to his past in a realistic way. Furthermore, VanDerWerff also applauded the way the show used the Vietnam War in a way that felt [...] "fresh". Independent reviewer Sarah Stegall awarded the episode a two out of five and derided it as a [...] "pseudo-political story". She was negative towards the [...] "lack of emotional investment", which she felt was what damaged the episode; she called Teager a cipher who was portrayed as a [...] "Twitchy Vet" [...] rather than a [...] "Tragic Hero".|$|E

When she threatens {{to go back to}} Spain he realises it's not what he wants and he stops her. He decides to man up and be a dad to his kids". A few days later, Suzanne, with Darren's help, gives birth to twins Jack and Francine. Dawson said that at first, Darren chooses to be in denial about it wants nothing to do with Suzanne because {{he does not want to}} lose Nancy. Dawson noted that the birth of Darren's babies is messy and surprising. Darren finds himself in a situation he never expected when he has to deliver the babies and accept responsibility for them. Dawson stated, [...] "I think it's a moment where Darren changes a little bit". Dawson added that Darren does [...] "step up to the mark" [...] and [...] "matures very quickly". Dawson felt that Darren enjoys being a father and <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> a [...] "purpose in life" [...] which he has never had before. Dawson explained that Darren usually thinks of himself but is now thinking of the babies. E4, regarding Darren becoming a father, commented that due to his previous antics, he would not be an ideal candidate for [...] "Father of the year". The storyline is resolved when Cindy pays Suzanne £200,000 to return to Spain so that she can have Darren to herself.

From Naruto's beginning, Born {{comments}} that the character is a , suggesting Naruto is {{the very definition of}} the word, given how he is characterized in the series, including how he interacts, and his behavior. Born argues that Naruto as a whole shows Confucian values, and that Naruto himself unsettles harmony in society. Amy Plumb, a PhD candidate at Macquarie University, states that Kishimoto used the mythology of the kitsune for Naruto's development throughout the series. She notes that {{at the beginning of the}} series, Naruto was a prankster and always causing trouble, the same as the kitsune. Plumb describes the Kyuubi (Demon) seal on Naruto's stomach as a [...] for how he develops. Writing for Manga's Cultural Crossroads, Omote Tomoyuki compliments Naruto's character, saying that he has great ambition to achieve a tragic destiny. He comments how the character has matured over the course of the series, stating how after he became a shinobi, he had let go of his childish ways that happened in the beginning of the series, and how he rarely joked around in Part II of the series when he became a teenager. Franziska Ehmcke, professor of Japanese studies at Cologne University, theorized that Naruto was named after whirlpools of the sea landscape of the Awa no Naruto, and compared his behavior to that natural feature, as both figures have uncontrollable energy within them. [...] Mike Hale compared Naruto to Buffy Summers of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, praising the series' portrayal of childhood loneliness. [...] Rik Spanjers regards Naruto's childishness as one of his strengths because <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> a well of resoluteness from which to draw on in his goal to end the ninja wars.|$|E

500|$|Lynsey {{was found}} dead by Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan). The death sparked a [...] "whodunit storyline" [...] with Mercedes in the frame for her murder. Digital Spy {{explained}} her motives stating, [...] "Mercedes has also become increasingly deranged in recent weeks and wanted to keep Lynsey quiet after she discovered the truth about her stalking of Mitzeee". A promotional image featuring Mercedes was later released by Hollyoaks which confirmed Mercedes as an official suspect in the mystery. Mercedes entered a relationship with Doctor Browning, who had previously paid her for sex, {{in an attempt to}} make Riley jealous. Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she [...] "was nervous about the union of the dark soul mates, Mercy and Browning, but their chemistry is so watchable - that story is pretty dark". Mercedes began to [...] "fall for the charms" [...] of Doctor Browning, believing she had [...] "landed on her feet" [...] when he invited her to a charity ball. Metcalfe commented that Mercedes began to think he could provide her with the WAG life style that she had always wanted. She added that Mercedes still had feelings for Riley and was [...] "being very sneaky" [...] in her attempts to win him back. She explained that Mercedes [...] "still wants Riley back but, as we know, when she has everything she desires, she still craves a bit of danger". Thompson elaborated on this, saying Mercedes [...] "thinks she wants the quiet life with Riley, but Dr Browning offers an exciting alternative for her, he knows what makes her tick, {{and the two of them}} are excited by how dangerous the other is". On Doctor Browning's feelings for Mercedes, Thompson said: [...] "he's fallen for her and will do whatever it takes to be with her. He thinks if he spends enough time with Mercy, he'll win her around". When Doctor Browning witnessed Riley kiss Mercedes [...] "it becomes a question of how much he can take" [...] and he decided he must [...] "make a quick move" [...] to prevent them reuniting. To do this he takes Mercedes to a shooting range, Thompson explained that there she [...] "realises there's an undeniable connection between them". He added that the couple are [...] "kindred spirits" [...] and Mercedes spending time with him made her rethink their relationship. Thompson said [...] "it seemed to be written in the stars that Mercedes and Riley will get back together - but Dr Browning won't let that happen" [...] and to do this he threatened Riley. Thompson claimed that due to Doctor Browning having incriminating evidence showing that Mercedes discharged herself at the time Lynsey was murdered <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> [...] "real power, she thinks she's in control, but she might just be underestimating Dr Browning..." [...] Metcalfe said that she feels Doctor Browning is Mercedes soul mate, explaining that [...] "he gives as good as he gets and I think that's really good for my character". On who Mercedes loves more out of Doctor Browning and Riley, Metcalfe said [...] "it's Doctor Browning all the way for her, i think he really took her by storm and she absolutely adores him". On 17 August 2012 during E4's first look episode it was revealed Doctor Browning had killed Lynsey. Hollyoaks official website said Doctor Browning's motives in killing Lynsey were [...] "presumably to protect Mercedes".|$|E

[...] Sieveking attends a presentation on the construction of a campus in the Brahmasthan (center point) of India, designed for 8,000 pandits who will recite vedic chants.

2500|$|He has an {{interest}} in nice restrooms and his personal bathroom habits border on obsession. In [...] "The Revenge", he quits his real estate job solely because he's forbidden to use his boss' private bathroom. In [...] "The Voice", he admits {{that one of the reasons}} he's staying at a job his boss has asked that he resign from (for feigning a disability) is that <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> [...] "private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city". In [...] "The Busboy", he claims to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the locations of the best public bathrooms in the city. He proves this in [...] "The Bizarro Jerry" [...] when he directs Kramer to [...] "the best bathroom in midtown" [...] at the offices of Brand/Leland, even describing the layout, marble, high ceiling and toilets that flush [...] "like a jet engine". [...] In [...] "The Gymnast", he told Jerry that he always removes his shirt when using the bathroom because [...] "it frees me up... no encumbrances". It's unclear if he dropped this habit after an embarrassing incident where he walked out of a bathroom shirtless at a lunch party attended by his girlfriend, her mom and other female members of her family. When working for the Yankees, he suggested having the bathroom stall doors stretched all the way to the ground (letting people's legs not be seen while in the stalls), and, in many episodes, he shows a fascination with toilet paper and its history. He also displays a fear of diseases, like lupus and cancer. In [...] "The Wife", George gets into trouble for peeing in the shower at a gym but defends his action with, [...] "It's all pipes!

2500|$|Jack Aubrey {{is one of}} {{the heroes}} of the series. His rise from a young {{lieutenant}} in the Royal Navy, through the ranks of commander and post-captain to rear-admiral is chronicled thoroughly. A resourceful and powerful man, he is {{regarded as one of the}} best fighting captains in the Royal Navy. Part of Aubrey's success is the result of having been disrated from midshipman and turned before the mast as a common sailor, in part because of a love affair he has with a black girl named Sally Mputa (this occurs prior to Master and Commander, but is referred to in several novels). Though this experience is painful at the time, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> unique (among officers) insight into the life and beliefs of common sailors, enabling him to more effectively lead them as an officer. [...] His own hero is Lord Nelson. His crew often follows him from ship to ship, not just because of his leadership but also due to his knack for capturing valuable prizes, for which he is nicknamed [...] "Lucky Jack". Aubrey is also referred to by some as [...] "Goldilocks" [...] because of his long yellow hair. His physical characteristics, namely a large frame and scarred visage, often lead to an underestimation of his mental abilities, but he is also a renowned mathematician and amateur astronomer, a Fellow of the Royal Society. Aubrey's love of women has led to problems with the men he has cuckolded and with his wife, Sophia. His other great loves are the violin and puns, which he seems to enjoy creating as much as telling. He is both a natural and a scientific sailor, as his interest in mathematics grew rapidly from his time on HMS Lively in Post Captain. Unfortunately, as masterful and lucky as Jack is at sea, he is somewhat inept and unlucky by land, and is often forced to hurriedly take ship in order to escape his troubles. His parents were both English, and when not at sea, he is part of the landed gentry, having learned fox-hunting and cricket in his young days, still enjoyed in his adult life.|$|E
