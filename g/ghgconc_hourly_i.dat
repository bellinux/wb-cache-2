Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is essential for mouse blastocyst implantation and also plays a role in human pregnancy. We examined the effect of a potent LIF antagonist (LA) on mouse implantation. In mice, LIF expression peaks on day 3. 5 of pregnancy (D 3. 5) (D 0. 5 = day of mating plug detection) in the uterine glandular epithelium. LA (7 mg/kg per day) administered from D 2. 5 to D 4. 5 via four <b>hourly</b> <b>i.</b> p. injections plus continuous administration via miniosmotic pump resulted in complete implantation failure. To improve its pharmacokinetic properties, we conjugated LA to polyethylene glycol (PEG), achieving a significant increase in serum levels. PEGylated LA (PEGLA) (37. 5 mg/kg per day) administered via three i. p. injections between D 2. 5 and D 3. 5 also resulted in complete implantation failure. PEGLA immunolocalized to the uterine luminal epithelium at the time of blastocyst implantation. Both LA and PEGLA reduced phosphorylation of the downstream signaling molecule STAT 3 in luminal epithelial cells on D 3. 5. The effects of PEGLA were found to be endometrial, with no embryo-lethal effects observed. These data demonstrate that administration of a PEGylated LIF antagonist is an effective method of targeting LIF signaling in the endometrium and a promising novel approach in the development of nonhormonal contraceptives for women...|$|R

It is emphasized that the 3 b 42 algorithm blends passive microwave (PMW) radiometer-based precipitation estimates from LEO satellites with infi-ared (IR) precipitation estimates from a world network of CEO satellites (representing - 15 % of the complete space-time coverage) All of these observations are first cross-calibrated to precipitation estimates taken from standard TRMM combined PR-TMI algorithm 2 b 31, and second adjusted at the large scale based on monthly-averaged rain-gage measurements.

Using a precipitation-based conditional sampling technique and a 14 year data set from a 25 m micrometeorological tower in a high-elevation subalpine forest, we examined how warm-season precipitation affected the above-canopy diel cycle of wind and turbulence, net radiation R net, ecosystem eddy covariance fluxes (sensible heat H, latent heat LE, and CO 2 net ecosystem exchange NEE) and vertical profiles of scalars (air temperature T a, specific humidity q, and CO 2 dry mole fraction χ c). This analysis allowed us to examine how precipitation modified these variables from <b>hourly</b> (<b>i.</b> e., the diel cycle) to multi-day time-scales (i. e., typical of a weather-system frontal passage). During mid-day we found the following: (i) even though precipitation caused mean changes {{on the order of}} 50 – 70 % to R net, H, and LE, the surface energy balance (SEB) was relatively insensitive to precipitation with mid-day closure values ranging between 90 and 110 %, and (ii) compared to a typical dry day, a day following a rainy day was characterized by increased ecosystem uptake of CO 2 (NEE increased by ≈ 10 %), enhanced evaporative cooling (mid-day LE increased by ≈ 30 W m − 2), and a smaller amount of sensible heat transfer (mid-day H decreased by ≈ 70 W m − 2). Based on the mean diel cycle, the evaporative contribution to total evapotranspiration was, on average, around 6 % in dry conditions and between 15 and 25 % in partially wet conditions. Furthermore, increased LE lasted at least 18 h following a rain event. At night, even though precipitation (and accompanying clouds) reduced the magnitude of R net, LE increased from ≈ 10 to over 20 W m − 2 due to increased evaporation. Any effect of precipitation on the nocturnal SEB closure and NEE was overshadowed by atmospheric phenomena such as horizontal advection and decoupling that create measurement difficulties. Above-canopy mean χ c during wet conditions was found to be about 2 – 3 μmol mol − 1 larger than χ c on dry days. This difference was fairly constant over the full diel cycle suggesting that it was due to synoptic weather patterns (different air masses and/or effects of barometric pressure). Finally, the effect of clouds on the timing and magnitude of daytime ecosystem fluxes is described...|$|R
