By using British Pendulum Tester, skid resistance of sidewalk was measured in a wet after snow-melt, sludgy, and snowy conditions. METHODS: The skid resistance was measured on surfaces including Concrete <b>Interlocking</b> <b>Block</b> <b>Paving,</b> Colour Asphalt Pavement, Granite Block Paving, Manhole, and Tactile Paving for Visually Impaired. Five trials at each measurement were made, and the average and standard deviation were derived. RESULTS: The skid resistance measured in wet after snow-melt, sludgy, and snowy conditions for the various surface types are summarized and compared. Reduction rates of skid resistance of sludgy and snowy against wet after snow-melt are also analysed. The skid resistance variation between measurement points which mimic pedestrian route in study site are analysed to check out the consistency of the skid resistance along the sidewalk. CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded that the skid resistance of sidewalk surfaces varied depending on the surface types and weather conditions. Secondly, reduction rates of skid resistance according to weather changes are varied depending on the surface types, Thirdly, consistency of skid resistance along the pedestrian route is hardly acquired in the study site at least.

Therefore, a revetment system is needed that is characterized by both high resistance against external loading and low material costs. <b>Interlocking</b> <b>block</b> revetments, which form a subgroup of block revetments, represent one possible solution. The single <b>blocks</b> are <b>interlocked</b> for example by a horizontal or a vertical connection. Higher strength against external loading compared to loose block revetments can be expected. Although <b>interlocking</b> revetment <b>blocks</b> are successfully in use at slopes exposed to waves and currents since decades, there are no studies available neither in the national nor in the international literature, which evaluate the strength of <b>interlocking</b> <b>block</b> revetments. The objective {{of this study is}} the development of a design approach for <b>interlocking</b> <b>block</b> revetments against hydrodynamic loading and the evaluation of the stability increase due to the interlocking. In order to achieve these objectives, the equation for the limit state for the uplift loading due to wave attack, which represents the main failure mechanism of <b>interlocking</b> <b>block</b> revetments, has to be determined. Within the equation the resistance of the <b>interlocking</b> <b>block</b> and the stress due to the wave attack has to be compared. The determination of the resistance is based on pull out tests, performed under laboratory conditions and on pull out tests conducted on a wave loaded revetment within large scale model tests performed at the Large Wave Channel Hannover (GWK). These tests show that an additional interlocking force due to particles occurs. These particles are washed in the gaps between the inter-locking blocks due to the waves and the following dewatering processes. The determination of the loading due to wave attack is based on data from large scale model tests performed at the GWK. The analysis of the data reveals a relationship between the parameters of the incoming wave and the caused uplift load. In the following these results are combined to a design approach. It supports the design of <b>interlocking</b> <b>block</b> revetments depending on a predefined design wave.
