Well into the 20th century, meat and blubber {{from the pilot}} whale was used to feed people {{for long periods of}} time. <b>Everybody</b> <b>got</b> a share, as is the custom to this day. The meat and blubber can be stored and {{prepared}} in a variety of ways, in Faroese it is called Tvøst og spik. When fresh, the meat is boiled or served as steaks. A pilot whale steak is called in Faroese: grindabúffur. Whale meat with blubber and potatoes in their skins are put into a saucepan with salt and then boiled for an hour or so. Slivers of the blubber are also a popular accompaniment to dried fish.|$|E

During 1994, these problems had, according to Wire, [...] "escalated {{to a point}} where <b>everybody</b> <b>got</b> a bit frightened" [...] and Edwards had also begun to suffer from anorexia nervosa. During April and May, when the band played concerts in Thailand and Portugal, Edwards was habitually cutting himself and appeared onstage in Bangkok with self-inflicted wounds across his chest.|$|E
500|$|The album's artwork {{was photographed}} by Harry Langdon in the {{swimming}} pool of the Jackson family's home. Jackson described Langdon as [...] "the sweetest man imaginable". She took inspiration from a photograph of actress Elizabeth Taylor submerged {{in a swimming pool}} which was taken early in her career. In the photograph, nothing could be seen apart from Taylor's face above the water; her body was hidden beneath the surface. Jackson thought the pose was dramatic and loved the fact that she could do the same thing, and not to have to reveal anything except for her face. With the photographer, his assistant and other people around the pool, she was still reluctant to take off her robe, and stand there in her bathing suit. She waited until <b>everybody</b> <b>got</b> distracted to slip into the pool. After they took the photos, she waited until everybody was gone {{to get out of the}} pool.|$|E

500|$|Bond {{wrote of}} her next role, [...] "It {{was like a}} dream come true when I saw my own name in the title role" [...] of Iolanthe (1882–84). Bond's first {{entrance}} as Iolanthe was across a [...] "stream". [...] She wrote in her memoirs about a performance of Iolanthe: [...] "Realism can be carried too far, as it was when one night a zealous property man said to me: 'It'll be just like the real thing to-night, Miss Bond. I've put some frogs into the water!' [...] 'Then you'll just have to fish them out again,' I retorted, 'and the curtain won't go up until you do.' [...] They had to catch those frogs in an inverted umbrella. [...] <b>Everybody</b> <b>got</b> splashed and agitated, and the performance was delayed for some time." [...] The critics praised Bond's portrayal of the title character: [...] "Miss Jessie Bond... may be credited with all the grace, delicacy, and fascination we should expect from a fairy mother, and her singing of the really exquisite melody in the last scene {{was one of the most}} successful items in the entire opera." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's cover art {{features}} {{the members of}} the band at the time of recording in a group pose and {{standing in front of a}} wood cut-out of the name [...] "Pearl Jam". The wood cut-out was constructed by Ament. Ament said, [...] "The original concept was about really being together as a group and entering into the world of music as a true band...a sort of all-for-one deal." [...] Ament is credited for the album's artwork and art direction, Lance Mercer receives credit for photography, and both Lisa Sparagano and Risa Zaitschek are credited for design. Ament stated, [...] "There was a bit of headbutting going on with the Sony art department at that time. The version that <b>everybody</b> <b>got</b> to know as the Ten album cover was pink and it was originally intended to be more of a burgundy color and the picture of the band was supposed to be black and white." [...] Pearl Jam's original name was taken from the professional basketball player Mookie Blaylock. It was changed after the band signed to Epic Records, as record executives were concerned about intellectual property and naming rights following Blaylock's inking of an endorsement deal with Nike. In commemoration of the band's original name, the band titled its first album Ten after Blaylock's jersey number.|$|E
500|$|A {{recording}} made at Carfax Tower in Oxford {{provided the}} bell chimes heard {{at the end}} of [...] "Strange Ones". These chimes were only heard on the I Should Coco version, not on Supergrass is 10, because on the I Should Coco album the chimes are used as a transition to the next track, [...] "Sitting Up Straight", which was not included in Supergrass is 10. [...] "Strange Ones" [...] was written about Cowley Road, Oxford, a place where the band once lived. It was originally intended to be the [...] "throwaway song" [...] on the B-side to [...] "Caught by the Fuzz". Another song on the album with the same theme, [...] "I'd Like To Know", was inspired by listening to [...] "Strange Ones" [...] played backwards on tape cassette. Supergrass took this sound, wrote new lyrics for it, and had another song for their album. Gaz Coombes says, [...] "One of the highlights of this album was recording 'Sofa (Of My Lethargy)'.... I remember <b>everybody</b> <b>got</b> in the live room and had an instrument, including Sam [...] on bass, a friend of his on hammond organ and we played the rest, all live, one take.... We made I Should Coco so fast because we wanted to catch the energy and excitement of the songs on tape, and do it before the money ran out!" [...] In a 2005 interview with BBC Radio London Quinn remembered [...] "writing that song [...] in my living room on a rainy day and Gaz sort of turned up with this chord sequence and we just went straight through it and just did it on 4 track".|$|E

500|$|The Weinstein Company also heavily recast {{the film}} with bigger-name {{actors in the}} hopes of {{attracting}} a larger audience. Anne Hathaway replaced Tara Strong in the lead role of Red; Jim Belushi replaced David Ogden Stiers in the role of Kirk, the Woodsman; Anthony Anderson replaced Tony Leech in the role of Det. Bill Stork; Glenn Close replaced Sally Struthers in the role of Granny Puckett; Xzibit replaced Joel McCrary in the role of Chief Grizzly; and Chazz Palminteri replaced Tom Kenny in the role of Woolworth the Sheep. Despite these recastings, Tara Strong retained the much-smaller role of Zorra, David Ogden Stiers retained the role of Nicky Flippers, Tom Kenny retained the role of Tommy, and Tony Leech retained the role of Glen. Many high-profile country singers were considered to replace Benjy Gaither in the role of Japeth, but none of them were available and Gaither retained the role. The Weinsteins also wanted to replace Joshua J. Greene in the role of Jimmy Lizard with a more famous actor such as Albert Brooks, but the role was ultimately not recast. Edwards appreciated the reason for the recastings and attributed {{a large part of the}} film's financial success to them. He expressed disappointment about the amount of recasting however, saying, [...] "At a certain point it became Recast-o-Rama, <b>everybody</b> <b>got</b> recast-happy. My feeling is, you get two or three names on that poster, you're fine. Our Hoodwinked poster has like a paragraph of names on it. After a certain point, I don't think you need more than two, three celebrities– give it to the voice actors. It sweetens the pot." [...] Since the film's animation had already been mostly completed by the time the recastings were made, the new actors had to deliver their lines exactly as the old actors had done, giving them no opportunity to improvise. Edwards expressed disappointment with the fact that the original actors would not get any credit for their improvisations in the film, which were copied by the replacement actors.|$|E

There was {{definitely}} joy getting onstage at that point. That was a wonderful time for everybody. It was really like a family. Ordinarily, with rock 'n' rollers, jazzers and classical musicians in the band, you'd think it was a three-headed serpent but <b>everybody</b> <b>got</b> along famously." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2012 {{the album}} was entered into Rock Sound magazine's Hall Of Fame with {{features}} on how the band {{look back on the}} album and how it has influenced others. Rock Sound said that the album made the band into [...] "one of our greatest rock commodities" [...] and called it a [...] "defining record for the UK rock scene as a whole". Lee Gaze stated [...] "Start Something is the greatest hits of what Lostprophets do". Aled Phillips of Kids In Glass Houses said [...] "it was a turning point for a lot of bands" [...] but also that [...] "everyone's jeans got tighter and started wearing Nike Dunks - it was a cultural shift. With them it was never just about the music, <b>everybody</b> <b>got</b> swept up in the whole aesthetic as well". Five British rock records - All Our Kings Are Dead, We Are the Dynamite, World Record, Free and Hold Me Down - were all cited as being heavily influenced by Start Something.|$|E

In January 2017, HIM were also announced as the headliner of Miljoona Rock, held in Tuuri, Finland, on 18 July 2017. On 5 March 2017, HIM announced the band would be disbanding following a farewell tour that same year. In the announcement, Valo stated: [...] "After quarter of a century [...] of love and metal intertwined we sincerely feel HIM has run its unnatural course and adieus must be said in order to make way for sights, scents and sounds yet unexplored. We completed the pattern, solved the puzzle and turned the key. Thank you." [...] Valo further elaborated on the band's decision to call it quits later, stating: [...] "We got together and started playing some songs and thinking whats next [...] We felt like the new material wasn't taking flight. We got along well together, but something was lacking. The stars weren't in alignment." [...] He also went on to say that: [...] "We felt like {{there was nothing left to}} give collectively. It was fun playing the old songs, <b>everybody</b> <b>got</b> along well together, but that spark was missing." [...] Valo didn't rule-out the possibility of the band reuniting in the future, stating: [...] "The good thing about this is that there's no drama [...] So it doesn't hurt the chances." ...|$|E
