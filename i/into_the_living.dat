H.A.R.M. states that if their ransom demands are not met, {{they will continue to}} use human time bombs to cause destruction around the world. Cate embarks on a train ride to Washington State, where Dr. Schenker is believed to be located. Cate finds him and manages to escort him to safety using an underground base.|$|E
5|$|The front entry leads <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> {{room where}} {{polished}} wood is found throughout {{as well as}} 19th century furnishings. The front room {{is part of the}} original building which consisted of one room. The room acted as the Deere's kitchen, living room, bedrooms, essentially everything. Deere eventually added onto the house, including a bedroom and an upstairs loft. The first floor bedroom would have been used for John and his wife, and possibly a couple of the children while the upstairs room would was used {{for the rest of the}} children. The Deeres left the home in 1847 when they moved to Moline, Illinois.|$|E

50|$|When {{the eggs}} hatch, <b>the</b> larvae burrow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> animal’s <b>living</b> tissue and feed on it. Their common name, the “screwworm”, {{is derived from}} the maggots that embed {{themselves}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> flesh of their host in a screw-like fashion. The larvae can burrow as deep as 15 cm <b>into</b> <b>the</b> host’s <b>living</b> tissue. As <b>the</b> maggots feed and cause tissue damage, the wound produces a characteristic odor, which can go unnoticed by humans. However, this wound entices female flies to the wound and encourages them to lay their eggs there as well, causing further infestation.|$|R

25|$|To {{conduct the}} scan, a {{short-lived}} radioactive tracer isotope is injected <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> subject (usually into blood circulation). Each tracer atom has been chemically {{incorporated into a}} biologically active molecule. There is a waiting period while the active molecule becomes concentrated in tissues of interest; then the subject {{is placed in the}} imaging scanner. The molecule most commonly used for this purpose is F-18 labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a sugar, for which the waiting period is typically an hour. During the scan, a record of tissue concentration is made as the tracer decays.|$|E

She envisioned a central front hall with a stairway flanked by walnut balustrades and an open parlor with folding doors opening <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room.

25|$|The {{main source}} of light on Earth is the Sun. Sunlight {{provides}} the energy that green plants use to create sugars mostly {{in the form of}} starches, which release energy <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> things that digest them. This process of photosynthesis provides virtually all the energy used by living things. Historically, another important source of light for humans has been fire, from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps. With the development of electric lights and power systems, electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight. Some species of animals generate their own light, a process called bioluminescence. For example, fireflies use light to locate mates, and vampire squids use it to hide themselves from prey.|$|E

Robert Ford later said he believed that James had realized {{they were there to}} betray him. Instead of confronting them, James walked across the living room and laid his revolvers on a sofa. He turned around and noticed a dusty picture above the mantle, and stood on a chair to clean it. Robert Ford drew his weapon, and shot the unarmed Jesse James {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E

According to her companion, Lillian Turner, Kiki had been in poor health, depressed and nervous. Turner had just given Preston a glass of milk and then went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room of the apartment to read. When she heard no sounds coming from Kiki's bedroom, she entered it, only to find a window open and Kiki gone. Kiki's pajama-clad body was soon discovered in an areaway behind the hotel.

25|$|Until recently, {{there were}} tax {{advantages}} to living trusts in South Africa, {{although most of}} these advantages have been removed. Protection of assets from creditors is a modern advantage. With notable exceptions, assets held by the trust are not owned by the trustees or the beneficiaries, the creditors of trustees or beneficiaries can have no claim against the trust. Under the Insolvency Act (Act 24 of 1936), assets transferred into a living trust remain at risk from external creditors for 6 months if the previous owner of the assets is solvent {{at the time of}} transfer, or 24 months if he/she is insolvent at the time of transfer. After 24 months, creditors have no claim against assets in the trust, although they can attempt to attach the loan account, thereby forcing the trust to sell its assets. Assets can be transferred <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> trust by selling it to the trust (through a loan granted to the trust) or donating cash to it (any natural person can donate R100 000 per year without attracting donations tax; 20% donations tax applies to further donations within the same tax year).|$|E
