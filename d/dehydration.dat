5|$|A {{determination}} {{of whether or}} not the person has <b>dehydration</b> is an important part of the assessment, with <b>dehydration</b> typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe <b>dehydration</b> are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring. Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of <b>dehydration.</b> Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is usually}} an acute and {{self-limiting}} disease {{that does not}} require medication. The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate <b>dehydration</b> is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). For children at risk of <b>dehydration</b> from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful, and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} fluid {{replaced}} {{depends on the}} estimated degree of <b>dehydration.</b> If <b>dehydration</b> is so severe as to cause shock (severely decreased blood pressure with insufficient blood supply to the body's organs), or a depressed level of consciousness, rapid infusion of saline (1 liter for adults, 10 ml/kg in repeated doses for children) is recommended to restore circulating volume. Slower rehydration based on calculated water and sodium shortage may be possible if the <b>dehydration</b> is moderate, and again saline is the recommended fluid. Very mild ketoacidosis with no associated vomiting and mild <b>dehydration</b> may be treated with oral rehydration and subcutaneous rather than intravenous insulin under observation for signs of deterioration.|$|E
5|$|A {{special case}} of {{intramolecular}} hydrogen bonds within proteins, poorly shielded from water attack and hence promoting their own <b>dehydration,</b> are called dehydrons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dehydration,</b> which removes {{hydroxyl}} {{groups from}} the cellulose and other plant molecules, {{resulting in the}} production of hydrogen-reduced coals or oil shales.|$|E
5|$|Drought {{tolerance}} by physiological adaptations such as {{the ability}} to survive extreme <b>dehydration</b> or the ability to extract water from very dry soil. Sagebrush and antelope bitterbrush are examples.|$|E
5|$|In various {{situations}} such as infection, insulin demands rise {{but are not}} {{matched by}} the failing pancreas. Blood sugars rise, <b>dehydration</b> ensues, and resistance to the normal effects of insulin increases further {{by way of a}} vicious circle.|$|E
5|$|Players must eat, {{drink and}} sleep, to avoid starvation, <b>dehydration</b> and exhaustion; {{failure to do}} so confers a steady {{decrease}} in certain skills and eventually leads to death if untreated.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia and <b>dehydration</b> are {{the most}} {{frequent}} immediate causes of death brought by AD, while cancer is a less frequent cause of death than in the general population.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{medical care}} applies to other acute health {{problems}} as well. Many illnesses with time-sensitive elements {{are common in}} developing countries, including severe infections, hypoxia caused by respiratory infections, <b>dehydration</b> caused by diarrhoea, intentional and unintentional injuries, postpartum bleeding, and acute myocardial infarction. These are potentially life-threatening conditions, yet effective treatment is often unavailable {{for much of the}} world's population.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began in}} Marrakech, Morocco, on May 4, 1998, and lasted {{seventeen}} weeks; {{the crew had}} to endure <b>dehydration,</b> sandstorms, and snakes while filming in the Sahara. The visual effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic, who blended film and computer-generated imagery to create the titular Mummy. Jerry Goldsmith provided the orchestral score.|$|E
5|$|Hospital {{evacuations}} continued {{from other}} area hospitals that were flooded or damaged. Reports from the Methodist Hospital indicated {{that people were}} dying of <b>dehydration</b> and exhaustion while the staff worked unendingly in horrendous conditions. The {{first floor of the}} hospital flooded and the dead were stacked in a second floor operating room. Patients requiring ventilators were kept alive with hand-powered resuscitation bags.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the above, blood samples are usually taken to measure urea and creatinine (measures of kidney function, which may be impaired in DKA {{as a result of}} <b>dehydration)</b> and electrolytes. Furthermore, markers of infection (complete blood count, C-reactive protein) and acute pancreatitis (amylase and lipase) may be measured. Given the need to exclude infection, chest radiography and urinalysis are usually performed.|$|E
5|$|In children, a Canadian study {{reported}} in 2001 that CVST occurs in 6.7 per million annually. 43% {{occur in the}} newborn (less than one month old), and a further 10% {{in the first year}} of life. Of the newborn, 84% were already ill, mostly from complications after childbirth and <b>dehydration.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{agents are}} more {{specific}} {{to a certain}} species. Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) occurs in pigs resulting in vomiting, diarrhea, and <b>dehydration.</b> It {{is believed to be}} introduced to pigs by wild birds and there is no specific treatment available. It is not transmissible to humans.|$|E
5|$|Terri Schiavo died at a Pinellas Park hospice on March 31, 2005. Although {{there was}} concern that Schiavo would {{experience}} significant symptoms from <b>dehydration</b> with {{the removal of the}} feeding tube, studies have shown that patients who have their feeding tubes removed, such as the case of Schiavo, usually have a peaceful death.|$|E
5|$|These {{symptoms}} may {{be severe}} enough to warrant hospitalisation. Treatment is supportive; antispasmodic medicines may lessen colicky abdominal cramps, and activated charcoal may be administered early on to bind residual toxin. Intravenous fluids may be required if <b>dehydration</b> has been extensive, especially with children and the elderly. Once gastric contents are emptied, metoclopramide {{may be used in}} cases of recurrent vomiting.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic {{activity}} in the belt is usually linked to the <b>dehydration</b> of the subducting slabs, which causes water and other subducted components {{to be added to}} the overlying mantle. In the case of the CVZ, this addition generates magmas that are further modified by the thick crust in the area, forming andesites, dacites and rhyolites.|$|E
5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where {{the blood pressure}} is decreased not due to <b>dehydration</b> but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{application of}} samarium {{and its compounds}} is as catalyst and chemical reagent. Samarium catalysts assist decomposition of plastics, dechlorination of pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), {{as well as the}} <b>dehydration</b> and dehydrogenation of ethanol. Samarium(III) triflate (Sm(OTf)3, that is Sm(CF3SO3)3), {{is one of the most}} efficient Lewis acid catalysts for a halogen-promoted Friedel–Crafts reaction with alkenes. Samarium(II) iodide is a very common reducing and coupling agent in organic synthesis, for example in the desulfonylation reactions; annulation; Danishefsky, Kuwajima, Mukaiyama and Holton Taxol total syntheses; strychnine total synthesis; Barbier reaction and other reductions with samarium(II) iodide.|$|E
5|$|Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} the syndrome of diabetes insipidus (unrelated to diabetes mellitus): inability to concentrate the urine, leading to polyuria (production of large amounts of clear urine) that is low in solutes, <b>dehydration</b> and—in compensation—extreme thirst and constant need to drink (polydipsia), as well as hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood). ADH deficiency may be masked if there is ACTH deficiency, with symptoms only appearing when cortisol has been replaced.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to <b>dehydration</b> and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} pentose residues of the bases, DNA strands have directionality. One end of a DNA polymer contains an exposed hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose; {{this is known as}} the 3'end of the molecule. The other end contains an exposed phosphate group; this is the 5'end. The two strands of a double-helix run in opposite directions. Nucleic acid synthesis, including DNA replication and transcription occurs in the 5'→3'direction, because new nucleotides are added via a <b>dehydration</b> reaction that uses the exposed 3'hydroxyl as a nucleophile.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{and fitness}} levels, age, body temperature, basal {{metabolic}} rate, {{and even a}} person's emotional state can all affect the heart rate. High levels of the hormones epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones can increase the heart rate. The levels of electrolytes including calcium, potassium, and sodium can also influence the speed and regularity of the heart rate; low blood oxygen, low blood pressure and <b>dehydration</b> may increase it.|$|E
5|$|However, stool {{cultures}} {{should be}} performed in those with blood in the stool, those {{who might have been}} exposed to food poisoning, and those who have recently traveled to the developing world. It may also be appropriate in children young than 5, old people, and those with poor immune function. Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance. As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended. Electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe <b>dehydration.</b>|$|E
5|$|In December 2012 Clinton {{was hospitalized}} {{for a few}} days for {{treatment}} of a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus. Her doctors had discovered the clot during a follow-up examination for a concussion she had sustained when she fainted and fell nearly three weeks earlier, as a result of severe <b>dehydration</b> from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe. The clot, which caused no immediate neurological injury, was treated with anticoagulant medication and her doctors have said she has made a full recovery.|$|E
5|$|In late 1995, Jackson {{was rushed}} to a {{hospital}} after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance (which was subsequently cancelled); a non-related writer claims that the incident {{was caused by a}} stress-related panic attack, while medics cited irregular beats, gastro-intestinal inflammation, <b>dehydration,</b> and kidney and liver irregularities. In none of these hospitalizations, including this one, did medics find drugs in Jackson's system. The BBC reported that during his 2005 trial, the singer again suffered from stress-related illnesses and severe weight loss.|$|E
5|$|It is {{beneficial}} to give fluids, as this helps reduce <b>dehydration.</b> It {{is no longer}} recommended to administer aspirin, unless advised {{to do so by}} medical personnel, as analgesics may mask symptoms. People should be made comfortable and placed in the supine position (horizontal), or the recovery position if vomiting occurs. In the past, both the Trendelenburg position and the left lateral decubitus position (Durant's maneuver) have been suggested as beneficial where air emboli are suspected, but are no longer recommended for extended periods, owing to concerns regarding cerebral edema.|$|E
5|$|James Robert Cade (September 26, 1927 – November 27, 2007) was an American physician, {{university}} professor, {{research scientist}} and inventor. Cade, {{a native of}} Texas, earned his bachelor and medical degrees at the University of Texas, and became {{a professor of medicine}} and nephrology at the University of Florida. Although Cade engaged in many areas of medical research, he is most widely remembered {{as the leader of the}} research team that created the sports drink Gatorade. Gatorade would have significant medical applications for treating <b>dehydration</b> in patients, and has generated over $150 million in royalties for the university.|$|E
5|$|Pediatricians {{are often}} the first health {{professionals}} to assess and raise suspicions of RAD in children with the disorder. The initial presentation varies according to the child's developmental and chronological age, although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction. Infants up to about 18–24 months may present with non-organic failure to thrive and display abnormal responsiveness to stimuli. Laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with malnutrition or <b>dehydration,</b> while serum growth hormone levels will be normal or elevated.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary care {{consists}} of gastric decontamination with either activated carbon or gastric lavage. However, {{due to the}} delay between ingestion and the first symptoms of poisoning, it is commonplace for patients to arrive for treatment long after ingestion, potentially reducing the efficacy of these interventions. Supportive measures are directed towards treating the <b>dehydration</b> which results from fluid loss during the gastrointestinal phase of intoxication and correction of metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and impaired coagulation.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviral {{enteritis}} is a mild {{to severe}} disease characterised by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhoea and low-grade fever. Once {{a child is}} infected by the virus, there is an incubation period of about two days before symptoms appear. The period of illness is acute. Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea. <b>Dehydration</b> {{is more common in}} rotavirus infection than in most of those caused by bacterial pathogens, and is {{the most common cause of}} death related to rotavirus infection.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms of {{diabetes}} insipidus should prompt a formal fluid deprivation test {{to assess the}} body's response to <b>dehydration,</b> which normally causes concentration of the urine and increasing osmolarity of the blood. If these parameters are unchanged, desmopressin (an ADH analogue) is administered. If the urine then becomes concentrated and the blood osmolarity falls, {{there is a lack}} of ADH due to lack of pituitary function ("cranial diabetes insipidus"). In contrast, there is no change if the kidneys are unresponsive to ADH due to a different problem ("nephrogenic diabetes insipidus").|$|E
5|$|The first {{region on}} either side of the bilayer is the {{hydrophilic}} headgroup. This portion of the membrane is completely hydrated and is typically around 0.8-0.9nm thick. In phospholipid bilayers the phosphate group is located within this hydrated region, approximately 0.5nm outside the hydrophobic core. In some cases, the hydrated region can extend much further, for instance in lipids with a large protein or long sugar chain grafted to the head. One common example of such a modification in nature is the lipopolysaccharide coat on a bacterial outer membrane, which helps retain a water layer around the bacterium to prevent <b>dehydration.</b>|$|E
5|$|Within a few days, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{identified}} primary {{concerns for}} the small island, including fixing the water supply, distributing water, clearing roads, and fixing damaged shelters. On the island, the water supply was rapidly diminishing; more than 80% of the islanders were without clean water, and {{the water from the}} treatment plant needed to be boiled for extended periods of time. Health issues included <b>dehydration,</b> sickness, and gastrointestinal problems. Without running water, several people bathed in the oil-contaminated harbor where many boats sunk, which caused skin irritations.|$|E
5|$|About 90% of beetle species enter {{a period}} of adult diapause, a quiet phase with reduced {{metabolism}} to tide unfavourable environmental conditions. Adult diapause {{is the most common}} form of diapause in Coleoptera. To endure the period without food (often lasting many months) adults prepare by accumulating reserves of lipids, glycogen, proteins and other substances needed for resistance to future hazardous changes of environmental conditions. This diapause is induced by signals heralding the arrival of the unfavourable season; usually the cue is photoperiodic. Short (decreasing) day length serves as a signal of approaching winter and induces winter diapause (hibernation). A study of hibernation in the Arctic beetle Pterostichus brevicorni showed that the body fat levels of adults were highest in autumn with the alimentary canal filled with food, but empty by the end of January. This loss of body fat was a gradual process, occurring in combination with <b>dehydration.</b>|$|E
