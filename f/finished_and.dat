40|$|Introduction: The success {{achieved}} {{by the use of}} composite resins in anterior teeth precipitately leads their use in posterior teeth. However, the indiscriminate application of these materials in cavities with several diverse sizes rapidly pointed out their lack of resistance to oclusal and proximal wear. Objective: To evaluate the surface roughness of composite resin in relation to <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing technique. Material and methods: Eight experimental groups (n = 15) were divided according to <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing technique: G 1 – Z 250 TM composite resin without surface <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing; G 2 – Z 250 TM composite resin plus surface <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing; G 3 – P 60 TM composite resin without surface <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing; G 4 – P 60 TM composite resin plus surface <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing; G 5 – Prodigy CondensableTM composite resin without surface <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing; G 6 – Prodigy CondensableTM composite resin plus surface <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing; G 7 – SurefillTM composite resin without surface <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing; G 8 – Surefill TM composite resin plus surface <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing. Three packable and one microhybrid (control group) composite resin was used. The surface roughness was measured using a profilometer at three points in each sample. The results were evaluated by ANOVA and Tukey test (p < 0. 05). Results: Prodigy CondensableTM composite resin showed the lowest surface roughness, while Surefill TM showed the highest surface roughness. Comparing the resins used, only between P 60 TM and SurefillTM there were no statistically significant differences (p ≥ 0. 05). Conclusion: Surface roughness was lower in all types of resin composites surfaces in contact with Mylar matrix strip than in areas submitted to <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing procedure...|$|R
