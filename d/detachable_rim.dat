5|$|Paul Baras of Brasier set {{the fastest}} lap {{of the race}} on his first lap. He {{held on to the}} lead until the third lap, when Szisz took over first position, {{defending}} it to the finish. Hot conditions melted the road tar, which the cars kicked up into the faces of the drivers, blinding them and making the racing treacherous. Punctures were common; tyre manufacturer Michelin introduced a <b>detachable</b> <b>rim</b> with a tyre already affixed, which could be quickly swapped onto a car after a puncture, saving a significant amount of time over manually replacing the tyre. This helped Nazzaro pass Clément on the second day, as the FIAT—unlike the Clément-Bayard—made use of the rims.|$|E
25|$|Clément-Bayard entered 3 {{cars for}} the inaugural 1906 French Grand Prix at Le Mans where Albert Clément {{finished}} third in his 100Hp machine. He completed the 1,238km event in 12 hours 49 minutes 46.2seconds. Clément lead the race {{at the end of}} laps 2 and 5 on the second day. Punctures were common and Michelin introduced a <b>detachable</b> <b>rim,</b> saving 11 minutes over manually replacing the tyre. This enabled Felice Nazzaro (FIAT) to take second place from Clément.|$|E
500|$|Michelin, Dunlop and Continental {{supplied}} tyres for the race. In the Grand Prix's {{one major}} technical innovation, Michelin introduced the jante amovible: a <b>detachable</b> <b>rim</b> with a tyre already affixed, {{which could be}} quickly swapped onto {{the car in the}} event of a puncture. Unlike in the Gordon Bennett races, only the driver and his riding mechanic were allowed to work on the car during the race, hence carrying the detachable rims could save time and confer a large advantage. The conventional method of changing a tyre, which involved slicing off the old tyre with a knife, and forcing the new tyre onto the rim, generally took around fifteen minutes; replacing Michelin's rims took less than four. The FIATs each used a full set, while the Renaults and two of the Clément-Bayards used them on the rear wheels of their cars. As carrying each rim added [...] to the weight of the car over conventional wheels and tyres, some teams—such as Itala and Panhard—could not carry them without exceeding the weight limit.|$|E
5000|$|A revised 15 hp {{model was}} {{introduced}} in 1911 dropping the monobloc engine and reverting to Austin's usual individually cast cylinders side-valve T-head engine design but an increased stroke of 4.5 in gave a capacity of 2838 cc [...] With the same bore it remained rated at 19.6 hp. Austin manufactured 688 of these more powerful cars. It had a four-speed gearbox with cone clutch, shaft and bevel-drive back axle. Suspension was provided by semi-elliptic leaf springs at the front and Austin-patent full-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. Brakes were by rear wheel drum and transmission brakes. The wheels were wooden artillery style wheels with Michelin <b>detachable</b> <b>rims,</b> 815 x 105 beaded-edge tyres. In 1913, a powered chassis with tyres was available for £350.|$|R
5|$|Reflections on {{the race}} by the organisers and the media {{generally}} concluded that the Grand Prix had been a poor replacement for the Gordon Bennett races. In part, this had been because the race was too long, and the system of starting the race—with each car leaving at 90-second intervals—had meant {{that there had been}} very little interaction between the competitors, simply cars driving their own races to time. The ACF decided that too much pressure had been put on drivers and riding mechanics by forbidding others to work on the cars during the race. It was also felt that the outcome of the race had been too dependent on the use of Michelin's <b>detachable</b> <b>rims.</b> Clément had driven the only Clément-Bayard to not have the rims, and it was thought that this contributed to Nazzaro passing him on the second day as he stopped to change tyres. Despite this, the ACF decided to run the Grand Prix again the following year. The publicity generated by the race prompted the German governing body to organise a similar event that favoured their own industry. The forerunner to the German Grand Prix, the Kaiserpreis (Kaiser's Prize) was raced in 1907.|$|R
50|$|On June 23, 1911, Haas {{applied for}} a patent for the <b>detachable</b> flush <b>rim</b> toilet. The key feature was a ring that, through {{downward}} pointing perforations, discharged multiple jets of water beneath {{the rim of the}} bowl. The object of the invention, he stated, was to “insure the thorough washing of every portion of the hopper or bowl from its highest point, and adapted to concentrate a powerful jet of water upon that portion of the bowl most susceptible to soiling.” On August 18, 1914 the US Patent Office issued patent number 1,107,515 for the flush rim toilet.|$|R

50|$|An open {{litter pan}} is {{generally}} {{the most basic}} and least expensive design. They are commonly constructed out of plastic, however some disposable models exist, {{in the shape of}} a rectangular tray with outwardly sloped sides 10 to 15 cm high. Open litter pans allow for maximum ventilation which may increase cat comfort. Also, they show the waste most visibly which may encourage owners to scoop the box more frequently. Litter pans with low walls may not contain litter when a pet scratches or digs, some animals who eliminate standing up may be able to urinate/defecate over the walls. Some designs include a <b>detachable</b> <b>rim</b> to help catch litter when the animal kicks to bury their waste.|$|E
25|$|Races in {{this period}} were heavily nationalistic affairs, with a few {{countries}} setting up races of their own, but no formal championship tying them together. The rules varied {{from country to country}} and race to race, and typically centered on maximum (not minimum) weights in an effort to limit power by limiting engine size indirectly (10–15L engines were quite common, usually with no more than four cylinders, and producing less than 50hp). The cars all had mechanics on board as well as the driver, and no one was allowed to work on the cars during the race except for these two. A key factor to Renault winning this first Grand Prix was held to be the <b>detachable</b> wheel <b>rims</b> (developed by Michelin), which allowed tire changes to occur without having to lever the tire and tube off and back on the rim. Given the state of the roads, such repairs were frequent.|$|R
