30|$|It is {{therefore}} {{not surprising that the}} Italian collective bargaining system has come under pressure in recent years (even before the crisis) since some economists, labour lawyers and politicians see it as the source of excessive wage rigidities that limit flexibility in time of difficulties, hinder regional reallocation and contributes to the stagnation Italy has experienced over the last 20  years. The largest employers’ association, Confindustria, has called for higher decentralisation in wage setting, giving greater importance to firm-level bargaining. The biggest company in Italy, FIAT, even exited Confindustria in 2009 (and it is still not a member) in order to freely bargain a different <b>establishment-level</b> <b>agreement</b> (though the resulting controversy was about work organisation rather than wages).
