50|$|Any {{abrasive}} material {{may be used}} to create a <b>honing</b> <b>stone,</b> but the most commonly used are corundum, silicon carbide, cubic boron nitride, or diamond.

50|$|Honing uses {{a special}} tool, called a <b>honing</b> <b>stone</b> or a hone, {{to achieve a}} {{precision}} surface. The hone is composed of abrasive grains that are bound together with an adhesive. Generally, honing grains are irregularly shaped and about 10 to 50 micrometers in diameter (300 to 1,500 mesh grit). Smaller grain sizes produce a smoother surface on the workpiece.|$|E

50|$|Since <b>honing</b> <b>stones</b> look {{similar to}} {{grinding}} wheels, {{it is tempting}} to think of honing as a form of low-stock removal grinding. Instead, it is better {{to think of it as}} a self-truing grinding process.|$|R
40|$|In the {{manufacturing}} process of abrasive stones with cubic boron nitride (CBN) as abrasive and metallic binder, some differences were observed regarding abrasive density at different heights of the stones. If abrasive density is too low, <b>honing</b> <b>stones</b> do not cut the material properly. Honing stones are obtained by means of sintering processes. Previously, a humectant material is added to abrasive grains, and then they are mixed with metallic binder. Humectant is used to assure covering of each abrasive grain with binder. In the present work, along {{the manufacturing}} process of <b>honing</b> <b>stones,</b> quality of the mixing process of components was assessed by means of two different parameters: covering degree of grains by binder (CD) and homogeneity degree (HD) of the mix before sintering process. Both parameters are calculated by means of weight measurement in the mixing step. Different quantities of humectant and different mixing times were taken into account. A higher quantity of humectant implies a higher covering degree, leading to more homogeneous <b>honing</b> <b>stones.</b> For this reason, highest quantity of humectant is recommended within the range studied. However, a certain mixing time is required to assure homogeneity of the mix prior to sintering. Postprint (published version...|$|R

50|$|The {{limitation}} on geometric accuracy is overcome in honing because the <b>honing</b> <b>stone</b> follows a complex path. In bore honing for example, the stone moves along two paths simultaneously. The stones are pressed radially outward {{to enlarge the}} hole while they simultaneously oscillate axially. Due to the oscillation, each slice of the honing stones touch a large area of the workpiece. Therefore, imperfections in the honing stone's profile cannot transfer to the bore. Instead both the bore and the honing stones conform to the average shape of the honing stones' motion, which {{in the case of}} bore honing is a cylinder. This averaging effect occurs in all honing processes; both the workpiece and stones erode until they conform to the average shape of the stones' cutting surface. Since the honing stones tend to erode towards a desired geometric shape, {{there is no need to}} true them. As a result of the averaging effect, the accuracy of a honed component often exceeds the accuracy of the machine tool that created it.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the example}} below, a short scythe blade, {{being used to}} clear brambles, is being sharpened. Before going to the forest the blade is peened back in the workshop, this reforms the {{malleable}} steel to create an edge profile that can then be honed. Peening is done only occasionally, how often depends on the hardness of the steel {{and the nature of}} the work. The Austrian blade shown is being used to cut tough-stemmed brambles and it is being peened about every thirty hours of work. Nicks and cuts to the blade edge can usually be worked out of the blade by peening and a new edge profile formed for honing. A peening jig is being used here but blades can be free-peened using various designs of peening anvils. The peening jig shown has two interchangeable caps that set different angles; a coarse angle is set first about 3mm back from the edge and the fine angle is then set on the edge, leaving an edge that lends itself to being easily honed. The blade is then honed using progressively finer honing stones and then taken to the field. In the field the blade is honed using a fine, ovoid whetstone (or rubber), fine-grained for grass, coarser for cereal crops. Honing is done the moment the mower senses that the edge has gone off, this may be every half hour depending on the conditions. The laminated <b>honing</b> <b>stone</b> shown here has two grades of stone and is carried into the field soaking in a water-filled holster on the belt. A burr is set up on the outside of the blade by stroking the blade on the inside, the burr is then taken off by gently stroking it on the outside. There are a great many opinions, regional traditions and variations on exactly how to do this, some eastern European countries even set up the burr on the inside.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHoning is an {{abrasive}} {{machining process}} that can produce very exact results regarding geometry, form and surface quality of the honed work piece. It is mainly used as the final finishing operation for ready-made bores and has to meet high demands regarding process stability and repeatability. As it can create a high ratio of bearing contact area to total area together with a high surface quality it is often used for highly stressed parts. During the process, the honing tool combines three movement components: a rotation around the tool axis, an oscillation along the tool axis and a radial feeding movement of the <b>honing</b> <b>stone.</b> The interface between <b>honing</b> <b>stone</b> and workpiece {{and the movement of}} the <b>honing</b> <b>stone</b> are very important for the process.

40|$|AbstractHoning is a {{machining}} {{process that can}} economically produce very exact bores regarding form, geometry and surface quality. It is mainly used as the final finishing operation for ready made parts and typically conducted on the inner surface of a cylinder. Due to their specific surface structure which has a good ability to keep lubricants and a high wear resistance, honed parts usually serve as functional surfaces to guide moved parts. Today, the main fields for applications of honing technology {{can be found in}} most sectors of the metal working industry, e. g. the automotive industries, hydraulic and pneumatic manufacture and aircraft industries. During the long-stroke honing process the tool, equipped with one or several abrasive honing stones, is performing three overlaying movement components. These are a rotational movement, an oscillating stroke movement in axial direction and the radial feed movement of the <b>honing</b> <b>stone.</b> This feed movement is one of the decisive factors for the results of the honing process. It can be realized through feed control or, in a more recent approach, through force control strategies. By feed controlled honing, the position of the <b>honing</b> <b>stone</b> is changed in defined invariable steps in certain time intervals. In contrast, by force controlled honing the force of the <b>honing</b> <b>stone</b> {{against the wall of the}} workpiece is measured indirectly by a force sensor, which is located within the feed unit of the honing machine. A required force value is given and, if necessary, the <b>honing</b> <b>stone</b> is fed outwards to reach and maintain a constant cutting force throughout the honing process. This constant force is supposed to produce better results of the honing process in terms of geometric and form accuracy as well as surface structure. The presented research studies aim at improving process know-how to further increase the production accuracy and process repeatability. In a comparison between parts honed with the two different feeding strategies for the <b>honing</b> <b>stone,</b> force components and moments were analyzed and correlated to the phases of the process and several influencing parameters.

40|$|AbstractThe {{finishing}} of precise bores is {{an important}} machining step, especially in the automotive industries. Bores can vary in diameter and form, from bigger piston bores in motor cylinders to rather small bores in fuel injection systems. Quality parameters for these bores are form- and geometric accuracy as well as surface roughness and structure. All requirements can economically be met by using the honing process as the final finishing operation for readymade bores. Honing is an abrasive machining process using abrasive grains usually made of diamond or Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) in metallic bonding. During the process three movement components, namely an axial movement along the bore axis, a rotational movement around the bore axis and the feeding movement of the <b>honing</b> <b>stone,</b> are combined. The feeding movement of the <b>honing</b> <b>stone</b> is induced by an axial movement of the feeding cone, which is translated into a radial movement of the <b>honing</b> <b>stone</b> at the interface between <b>honing</b> <b>stone</b> and work piece. The feeding movement is decisive {{for the results of}} the honing process. For a regulation of the process that enables high process stability and repeatability as well as good quality results from the first part {{it is important to know}} about the forces in the feeding system of the tool. The following paper describes the static and dynamic correlation of the process forces in order to give a basis for a new regulation approach especially for bores with smaller diameters (below 20 mm) where the direct measurement of the process forces with a tool- integrated sensor is difficult. Measured signals are investigated for their dynamic influences. The theoretical approach is then compared to signals measured during the process...|$|E

50|$|Steeling helps {{maintain}} sharpness. This process realigns the edge, correcting for dulling causes {{such as a}} rolled edge. A sharpening {{steel is}} a type of hardened cylindrical rod used similarly to <b>honing</b> <b>stones.</b> For example, a butcher steel is a round file with the teeth running the long way, while a packer steel (used in the meat packer's industry) is a smooth, polished steel rod designed for straightening the turned edge of a knife, and is also useful for burnishing a newly finished edge. Because steels have a small diameter they exert high local pressure, and therefore affect the knife metal when used with very little force. They are intended for mild steel knives that are steeled several times a day, but are not well suited for today's tougher and harder blade steels. Diamond steels are now available that have an industrial diamond coating and can remove blade metal as well as straighten, therefore used correctly they can re-profile a knife instead of just honing.|$|R

Therefore, the cutting surface of the tool displays an irregular topography. Quantification of surface topography scenario may supply valuable information to evaluate and understand its correlation to wear mechanisms. In this study, an experimental protocol consisting of five steps: specimen preparation, surface scanning, image assembly, image digital processing and surface quantification, was proposed and validated by characterizing two CBN honing tools used for precision machining: B 151 /L 2 / 2010 / 50 (B 151) and B 91 / 128 /x 44 / 35 (B 91) CBN honing stones.

The negative consequences of the subsequent assembly processes and operation of the engine is that the cylinders and pistons are deformed, resulting in a loss of power and an increase in fuel consumption. This problem can be solved by using an adaptronic tool, which can machine the cylinder to a predetermined non-round geometry, which will deform to the required geometry during assembly and operation of the engine. The article describes the actuatory effect of the tool in conjunction with its measuring and controlling algorithms. The adaptronic tool consists out the basic tool body and three axially-staggered floating cutter groups, these cutter groups consist out of guides, actuators and <b>honing</b> <b>stones.</b> The selective expansion of the tool is realised by 3 piezoelectric multilayer-actuators deployed in a series - paralle l arrangement.

40|$|The {{demands on}} {{decreased}} environmental impact from vehicles are {{resulting in a}} strong push for decreased engine oil and fuel consumption. Engine oil and fuel consumption are to a great extend controlled by the topography of the cylinder liner surface. Recent engine tests have shown a promising reduction in oil consumption when using cylinder liners with a smoother finish than the current plateau honing. One approach to produce smoother liner surfaces is to replace SiC ceramic <b>honing</b> <b>stones</b> with diamond tools. However, event though the diamond honing process results in higher productivity, improved demands of quality control is needed to monitor the degree of cold worked material - “blechmantel” (German), and the resulting risk of increased wear and scuffing. A number of petrol and diesel engine cylinder liners have been mapped {{to be able to}} verify the quality and consequences, in terms of wear and function, of the honing process. A new mapping method, combining SEM images and quantitative image analysis with traditional 2 D profilometry has been developed and tested in this study. The liners where tested in a reciprocating rig of 8 mm stroke and with a frequency of 10 Hz, simulating the top-dead center conditions in a running engine. The tests where carried out in high- and low pressure conditions with smooth respectively rough liner roughnesses against PVD coated piston rings. The developed surface mapping method was employed before and after the test to study effect of running-in wear on the surface, features characterized with the SEM- and the 2 D profilometer. The results show that combining SEM- and profilometric methods gives a good picture of the effects of varying the cylinder liner pressure and roughness.
