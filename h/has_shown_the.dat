5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren is {{unrelated}} to the true wrens.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} effect of winter and spring sowing on yield and plant traits of safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) cultivars under Tekirdağ conditions. This research was conducted at Applying Research Field, Faculty of Agriculture University of Namık Kemal in 2006 - 2007. Fourteen safflower cultivars were used in this study. The research was conducted using a randomized complete block, split plot design with three replicates. Different sowing time significantly affected some agronomic characters of the genotypes used in this study. There was interaction between genotypes and sowing times. According to the results of this research; Yenice <b>has</b> <b>showed</b> <b>the</b> tallest values in winter sowing 207. 5 cm for plant height, Montola 2000 <b>has</b> <b>showed</b> <b>the</b> smallest values in spring sowing 55. 2 cm for plant height. GW 9003 <b>has</b> <b>showed</b> <b>the</b> highest values in spring sowing 45. 4 gr for 1000 seed weight; Kazakhstan Population <b>has</b> <b>showed</b> <b>the</b> lowest values in spring values 36. 7 gr for 1000 seed weight. Dinçer <b>has</b> <b>showed</b> <b>the</b> hightest values in winter sowing 357. 0 kg/da for yield, Yenice <b>has</b> <b>showed</b> <b>the</b> lowest values in spring sowing 104. 6 kg/da for yield.

5|$|Like other fairywrens, {{the splendid}} fairywren is {{unrelated}} to the true wren. It was first classified {{as a member of}} the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae by Richard Bowdler Sharpe, though it was later placed in the warbler family Sylviidae by the same author, before being placed in the newly recognised Maluridae in 1975.

5|$|The white-winged fairywren {{was often}} {{referred}} to as the blue-and-white wren, and early observers, such as Norman Favaloro of Victoria, refer to them by this name. However, like other fairywrens, the white-winged fairywren is unrelated to the true wren (family Troglodytidae). It was previously classified as a member of the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae, and later as a member of the warbler family Sylviidae, before they were placed in the newly recognised Maluridae in 1975. More recently, DNA analysis <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> Maluridae family to be related to the Meliphagidae (honeyeaters), and the Pardalotidae (pardalotes, scrubwrens, thornbills, gerygones and allies) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea.|$|E
5|$|Green-head ant {{males are}} {{produced}} irregularly {{throughout the year}} and are low-flying ants. Recorded nuptial flights begin between September to November at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), when a number of males begin to emerge from their nest. Sometimes, however, the males may return to their nest after briefly appearing outside. The green-head ant is a gamergate species, which means that males can successfully mate with the workers. These workers remain outside their nest with their head and thorax appressed and gaster elevated into the air. Observation <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> workers first attacking the males when the two first encounter each other, followed by the male mounting the worker by grasping it in the cervical region with its mandibles, successfully attaching itself. Both ants usually rest when they mate, but sometimes the workers may groom themselves or move about several moments after, thereby disengaging with the male. On a few occasions, workers have been seen to move as soon as copulation begins and drag the male, eventually dislodging it. Copulation usually occurs at 8 to 9 in the morning, with pairs lasting for 30 seconds to almost one minute. Most pairs mate once, but others may copulate with each other twice. In some cases, males will successfully mate with two workers, and some pairs may return to their nest while mating.|$|E
