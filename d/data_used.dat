5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} is {{the investigation}} of how enzymes bind substrates {{and turn them into}} products. The rate <b>data</b> <b>used</b> in kinetic analyses are commonly obtained from enzyme assays. In 1913 Leonor Michaelis and Maud Leonora Menten proposed a quantitative theory of enzyme kinetics, which is referred to as Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The major contribution of Michaelis and Menten was to think of enzyme reactions in two stages. In the first, the substrate binds reversibly to the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. This is sometimes called the Michaelis-Menten complex in their honor. The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product. This work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane, who derived kinetic equations that are still widely used today.|$|E

This study directs {{to find the}} translation techniques that the translator used to analyze in translating utterances in subtitle text. The researcher used a descriptive qualitative method to describe the translation techniques used in subtitle text of Finding Nemo movie. The technique of collecting data are searching the script from the internet, downloading the script from the internet, segmenting the utterances produced by the characters. And the analyzing the data, the framework proposed by Molina and Albir (2002 : 509) was applied. The steps are reading the transcript and subtitle of the movie, identifying the translation techniques used in the movie subtitle, analyzing the utterances into the translation techniques in the movie subtitle, and drawing conclusion. Based on the analysis, the researcher found 850 utterances that contain 11 techniques. They are 100 (11, 76 %) <b>data</b> <b>using</b> borrowing; 19 (2, 23 %) <b>data</b> <b>using</b> calque; 7 (0, 82) <b>data</b> <b>using</b> compensation; 13 (1, 54 %) <b>data</b> <b>using</b> discursive creation; 11 (1, 3 %) <b>data</b> <b>using</b> established equivalence; 3 (0, 35 %) <b>data</b> <b>using</b> linguistic compression; 648 (76, 24 %) <b>data</b> <b>using</b> literal translation; 3 (0, 35 %) <b>data</b> <b>using</b> modulation; 1 <b>data</b> <b>using</b> particularization (0, 12 %); 24 (2, 82 %) <b>data</b> <b>using</b> reduction; and 21 (2, 47 %) <b>data</b> <b>using</b> substitution.
