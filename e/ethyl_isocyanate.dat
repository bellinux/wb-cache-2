Elution order of the enantiomers provided {{an indication of the}} importance of carbamate substituent configuration in chiral recognition. The chiral carbohydrates were also found to contribute to the chiral selectivity of the CSP. The effect of mobile phase and derivatizing agent on the chromatographic behavior of the NEC CSPs was also evaluated.

Surface concentrations of the bonded glucose oligomers were found to decrease as the carbon chain length of the oligomer increased.

All six possible mono-substituted CD products were separated by HPLC and characterized by IH NMR. The primary substitution product predominates when the reaction is carried out under reflux conditions in pyridine without NaH activation. The C- 2 substitution product predominates when the reaction is carried out in DMF. Conversion of 2 - 0 -(1 -(1 -naphthyl) ethylcarbamoyl) -β- CD to 6 - 0 -(1 -(1 -naphthyl) ethylcarbamoyl) -β-CD was observed when NaH was used to the activate hydroxyl groups of CD. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of 2 - 0 -((R) - 1 -(1 -naphthyl) ethylcarbamoyl) -β- cyclodextrin(RC- 2) and 2 - 0 -((S) - 1 -(1 naphthyl) ethylcarbamoyl) -β-cyclodextrin(SC- 2) were obtained in D 20. NMR spectra indicate at least two conformers existing both in RC- 2 (90 : 10) and SC- 2 (61 : 39) at 25 °C. Complete assignment of 1 H and 13 C spectra of the major conformer of RC- 2 was accomplished using homo- and heteronuclear two dimensional NMR techniques. Correlations observed in 2 D NMR (ROESY, HMBC) revealed complete glucose connectivity of RC- 2 and SC- 2. The inclusion state and orientation of the naphthyl substituent for both RC- 2 and SC- 2 {{was derived from the}} correlations observed between naphthyl and cyclodextrin (CD) protons in ROESY spectra, as was the various extents of anisotropic effects on the seven glucose units induced by the naphthyl group. The relative populations of the included and excluded orientation of the naphthyl substitutent in RC- 2 and SC- 2 were found to be solvent dependent in methanol/water systems. Computer modeling revealed one stable (included in the cavity) conformer in RC- 2 and two possible excluded conformers in SC- 2.

Dabei wurden die in der Literatur beschriebenen Varianten des Einsatzes von funktionalisierten Linkern sowie die post-synthetische Modifizierung angewendet. Des Weiteren konnte gezeigt werden, dass sich post-synthetisch modifizierte Cr-MIL- 101 -Derivate zum Nanocasting und zur chiralen Trennung von Enantiomerengemischen eignen. Zur Synthese der Materialien wurde auf die Hydrothermalsynthese, Hochdurchsatzmethodik (HT-Methodik), Mikrowellensynthese und sonochemische Synthese zurückgegriffen. Zur ausführlichen Charakterisierung der Verbindungen wurden Röntgenpulverdiffraktometrie, Gassorptionsmessungen, IR- und Raman-Spektroskopie, Thermogravimetrie sowie Festkörper- und Lösungs NMR-Spektroskopie durchgeführt. Der Einsatz funktionalisierter Linkermoleküle führte im ersten Teil der Arbeit zu funktionalisierten anorganisch-organischen Hybridverbindungen. Dazu wurde das photoschaltbare Molekül 2 -Phenylazoimidazol synthetisiert und in die neue Verbindung [Zn(C 3 H 3 N 2) (C 3 H 2 N 2 -N=N-C 6 H 5) ] eingebaut. Die zu ZIF- 8 isostrukturelle Verbindung zeigt unter Einstrahlung von UV- und sichtbarem Licht ein partiell reversibles Schaltverhalten. Durch Einsatz einfach-funktionalisierter Terephthalsäurederivate wurden neue Cr-MIL- 101 -Derivate hergestellt. So konnte jeweils das Bromterephthalsäure- und Hydroxyterephthalsäurederivat erhalten werden sowie ein Mischlinker Cr-MIL- 101, welches sowohl Amino- als auch Hydroxygruppen enthält. Der zweite Teil der Arbeit befasst sich mit der post-synthetischen Modifizie-rung von Cr-MIL- 101. Dabei wurden sowohl die anorganische als auch die organische Baueinheit modifiziert. So konnte in einer elektrophilen Aromatensubstitution eine Nitrogruppe eingeführt werden, welche zur Aminogruppe reduziert wurde. Diese wurde mit Ethylisocyanat zum Ethylharnstoffderivat weiter derivatisiert. Post-synthetische Modifizierung an der anorganischen Baueinheit konnte durch Ligandenaustausch an den Cr(III) -Zentren unter Einsatz von Aminopropyltriethoxysilan erreicht werden. Potentielle Anwendungsgebiete der post-syntethisch modifizierten Cr-MIL- 101 -Verbindungen wurden im dritten Teil der Arbeit erschlossen. In einem Nanocas-ting-Prozess wurde das aminopropyltriethylsilan-funktionalisierte Cr-MIL- 101 mit Resorcin infiltriert, welches innerhalb des Porensystems polymerisiert und das ge-wonnene Komposit pyrolysiert wurde. Es zeigte sich, dass der so erhaltene mikroporöse Kohlenstoff die gekappt-oktaedrische Morphologie der Cr-MIL- 101 -Kristalle aufweist. Chirale Gruppen ließen sich mittels post-synthetischer Modifizierung in die Gerüststruktur von Cr-MIL- 101 -NH 2 durch Reaktion mit (S) 2 Acetoxybernsteinsäureanhydrid einbringen. Der so gewonnene chirale Cr MIL 101 AH wurde in Batch-Experimenten zur Trennung von Enantiomeren ein-gesetzt. Die Quantifizierung der Enantiomere nebeneinander wurde durch Zusatz eines chiralen Lanthanoid-Shiftreagenz durchgeführt. Es zeigte sich, dass die Verbindung in der Lage ist, Racemate von chiralen Sulfoxiden und chiralen Alkoholen zu trennen. So konnte bei dem Trennversuch von tert-Butylmethylsulfoxid ein Enantiomerenüberschuss von 31 % erreicht werden. The {{topic of}} this work is the {{functionalization}} and modification of inorganic-organic hybrid compounds. The use of functionalized linker molecules for MOF syntheses {{as well as the}} post-synthetic modification are described. Furthermore, it is shown that the modified Cr-MIL- 101 compounds are useful for nanocasting and chiral separation procedures. Materials were prepared by hydrothermal syntheses, high-throughput (HT) syntheses, microwave assisted and ultrasound assisted syntheses. Detailed characterizations were carried out using X-ray powder diffraction, gas sorption measurements, IR and Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric measurements as well as solid state and liquid NMR-spectroscopy. In {{the first part of the}} work, functionalized linker molecules were used to obtain functionalized inorganic-organic hybrid compounds. 2 -Phenylazoimidazole was synthesized and incorporated into the new compound [Zn 3 (C 3 H 3 N 2) (C 3 H 2 N 2 -N=N-C 6 H 5) ] which is isostructural to ZIF- 8 and crystallizes in a sodalite-type structure. The irradiation of the compound with UV and visible light leads to a partial reversible isomerization behavior. Functionalized Cr-MIL- 101 materials were prepared using bromo- or hydroxy-functionalized terephthalic acid derivatives. Bifunctional mixed linker Cr-MIL- 101 was also synthesized containing amino- and hydroxy functionalities. The second part of the work describes the post-synthetic modification of the inorganic building blocks as well as the organic linker molecules of Cr MIL 101. The nitrated compound was prepared by electrophilic aromatic nitration. Nitro groups were subsequently reduced to amino groups, which in turn were reacted with <b>ethyl</b> <b>isocyanate</b> to obtain the ethyl urea derivative. Post-synthetic modification of the inorganic building blocks was achieved by ligand substitution at the Cr 3 + ions employing aminopropyltriethoxysilane. Potential applications of the post-synthetic modified compounds were devel-oped in the third part of the work. In a nanocasting process the aminopropyltriethoxysilane functionalized Cr-MIL- 101 was infiltrated with resorcinol which was polymerized within the network. The composite was pyrolized and produed a microporous carbon that exhibited the same morphology as the initial Cr-MIL- 101 crystals. In an alternative approach, chiral groups were introduced into Cr-MIL- 101 by reaction of Cr-MIL- 101 -NH 2 with (S) - 2 -acetoxy succinic anhydride. This yielded chiral Cr-MIL- 101 -AH, which was employed in a batch experiment for the separation of enantiomers. The ratio of enantiomers was determined by addition of a lanthanoid NMR-shift reagent. It was shown that the chiral MIL- 101 material can separate racemic mixtures of chiral sulfoxides and chiral alcohols.
