We applied the PR-NMDFB-based filtering property in designing the wideband carrier and symbol timing synchronization. This allows us to concurrently design BE filters and fractional delay filters within the entire FB-based receiver structure. The complexity analysis shows the proposed approach offers 48 % workload reduction when only the synchronization tasks are considered, and further reduction in computation is expected if equalization is considered. Moreover, {{in contrast to the}} conventional FIR approach, which requires the hardware clock to run on many times of the <b>input</b> <b>sample</b> <b>rate,</b> the proposed FBSC receiver allows all the filtering tasks to operate on deeply decimated sample rate, which is a highly desired characteristic for the hardware implementation of fully digital receivers.|$|E

Such general dual-rate systems are implementable at finite cost; in particular, they are {{equivalent to the}} cascade connections of linear periodically time-varying (LPTV) systems and block expanders and decimators. Using the general building blocks in nonuniform multirate filter banks, one can achieve what are otherwise impossible, thus {{paving the way for}} optimal design of synthesis systems. 1.

40|$|Reservoir {{computing}} (RC) is a computing scheme {{related to}} recurrent neural network theory. As {{a model for}} neural activity in the brain, it attracts a lot of attention, especially because of its very simple training method. However, building a functional, on-chip, photonic implementation of RC remains a challenge. Scaling delay lines down from optical fiber scale to chip scale results in RC systems that compute faster, {{but at the same}} time requires that the input signals be scaled up in speed, which might be impractical or expensive. In this brief, we show that this problem can be alleviated by a masked RC system in which the amplitude of the input signal is modulated by a binary-valued mask. For a speech recognition task, we demonstrate that the necessary <b>input</b> <b>sample</b> <b>rate</b> can be a factor of 40 smaller than in a conventional RC system. In addition, we also show that linear discriminant analysis and input matrix optimization is a well-performing alternative to linear regression for reservoir training...|$|E
40|$|Performing a {{discrete}} Radon transform (DRT) {{with an array}} of space-time samples results in a function of slowness (inverse velocity) and time intercept. Time domain beamforming and semblance, two commonly used methods of obtaining a slowness-time analysis, give outputs that are composed of discrete Radon transforms of the data. Many of the properties satisfied by the continuous Radon transform are also satisfied in the discrete case. Sampling problems give rise to additional considerations not present in the continuous transform. As a function of slowness, beamforming decimates each channel in proportion to its distance from the beamformer reference channel. This viewpoint allows the slowness bandwidth to be expressed {{as a function of the}} array spatial locations and the normalized temporal bandwidth of the received waveforms. These relationships determine the temporal sample rate increase at each channel necessary to avoid slowness aliasing. Examples are presented showing the slowness aliasing that results if either the temporal bandwidths or the array spatial aperture are too large. The conclusions regarding the slowness sampling density are applicable as well to frequency domain beamforming, where the beams must also be computed at discrete values of slowness. The slowness sampling rate can be increased using a technique termed interpolation beamforming. A polyphase filter structure is shown to be particularly suited to interpolation beamforming. The polyphase structure results in a pipelined processor, in which computation occurs in parallel filters at the low <b>input</b> <b>sample</b> <b>rate.</b> We describe four methods of inverting the beamformer output to reconstruct the space-time samples. Of the four, one method, a block matrix inversion technique, is new. It is exact when operating on the original data, but fails when the beamformer output is modified. This problem can be alleviated by reducing the dimensionality of the inversion matrix using a singular value decomposition. Time-domain beamforming separates transient plane-waves as a function of their velocity and time-of-arrival. Modifications in the beamformer output domain, such as masking out coherent interfering signals while taking into account both velocity and time information, are more straightforward than with traditional (k-(omega)) velocity filtering methods. Processing in this domain is especially useful if a time-varying velocity filter is required...|$|E

After {{application}} of the PCZ, the <b>input</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>rate</b> is divided by Q and, similarly, the system BW is divided by Q, yielding equally spaced channels and a reduced <b>sampling</b> <b>rate</b> at {{the output of the}} PCZ. This is called a standard or maximally decimated polyphase channelizer [3]. In [3], an interpolation operation was combined with a maximally decimated PCZ to perform a rational resampling at the same time. This is a partially decimated PCZ. Since the interpolation in a partially decimated PCZ is being performed at some rate P while Q samples are being presented to the input, the output of the IP is presented R = Q/P (R is referred to here as the rational resampling ratio) times faster than in the standard PCZ configuration. This in turn causes the need to shift the data at the input and output of the IP operation. A serpentine shift and circular shift are needed to provide such translations, which prevent phase shifts at the output of the DFT [3].|$|R

40|$|Digital {{resampling}} is {{a process}} that converts a digital signal from one <b>sampling</b> <b>rate</b> to another. This process is performed by means of interpolating between the <b>input</b> <b>samples</b> to produce output samples at an output <b>sampling</b> <b>rate.</b> The digital interpolation process is accomplished with an interpolation filter. The problem of resampling digital signals at an output <b>sampling</b> <b>rate</b> that is incommensurate with the <b>input</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>rate</b> is the first topic of this thesis. This problem is often encountered in practice, for example in multiplexing video signals from different sources for the purpose of distribution. There are basically two approaches to resample the signals. Both approaches are thoroughly described and practical circuits for hardware implementation are provided. A comparison of the two circuits shows that one circuit requires a division to compute the new sampling times. This time scaling operation adds complexity to the implementation with no performance advantage over the other circuit, and makes the 'division free' circuit the preferred one for resampling. The second topic of this thesis is performance analysis of interpolation filters for Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) signals in the context of timing recovery. The performance criterion of interest is Modulation Error Ratio (MER), which {{is considered to be a}} very useful indicator of the quality of modulated signals in QAM systems. The methodology of digital resampling in hardware is employed to describe timing recovery circuits and propose an approach to evaluate the performance of interpolation filters. A MER performance analysis circuit is then devised. The circuit is simulated with MATLAB/Simulink as well as implemented in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Excellent agreement between results obtained from simulation and hardware implementation proves the validity of the methodology and practical application of the research works...|$|R
