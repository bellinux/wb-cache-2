50|$|In the kidneys, as {{a result}} of benign {{arterial}} hypertension, hyaline (pink, amorphous, homogeneous material) accumulates in the walls of small arteries and arterioles, producing the thickening of their walls and the narrowing of the arterial openings, a process known as arteriolosclerosis. The resulting inadequate blood flow produces tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and glomerular alterations (smaller glomeruli with different degrees of hyalinization - from mild to sclerosis of glomeruli) and scarring around the glomeruli (periglomerular fibrosis). In advanced stages, kidney failure will occur. Functional nephrons have dilated tubules, often with hyaline casts in the opening of the tubules.

50|$|Plasmodium malariae {{causes a}} chronic {{infection}} {{that in some}} cases can last a lifetime. The P. malariae parasite has several differences between it and the other Plasmodium parasites, one being that maximum parasite counts are usually low compared to those in patients infected with P. falciparum or P. vivax. The reason for this can be accounted for by the lower number of merozoites produced per erythrocytic cycle, the longer 72-hour developmental cycle (compared to the 48-hour cycle of P. vivax and P. falciparum), the preference for development in older erythrocytes and the resulting earlier development of immunity by the human host.Another defining feature of P. malariae is that the fever manifestations of the parasite are more moderate relative to those of P. falciparum and P. vivax and fevers show quartan periodicity. Along with bouts of fever and more general clinical symptoms such as chills and nausea, the presence of edema and the nephrotic syndrome has been documented with some P. malariae infections. It has been suggested that immune complexes may cause structural <b>glomerular</b> <b>damage</b> and that renal disease may also occur. Although P. malariae alone has a low morbidity rate, it does contribute to the total morbidity caused by all Plasmodium species, as manifested in the incidences of anemia, low birth rate and reduced resistance to other infections.|$|E

The mixed organic solvents consisted of gasoline, dimethylbenzene and formaldehyde (GDF) in {{the ratio of}} 2 : 2 : 1, and were used at 12, 000 PPM to treat the rats twice a day, each for 3 hours. Proteinuria appeared in the rats after exposure for 5 – 6 weeks. The incidences of proteinuria in male and female rats after exposure for 12 weeks were 43. 8 % (7 / 16) and 25 % (4 / 16), respectively. Urinary N-Acetyl-b-(D) -Glucosaminidase (NAG) activity was increased significantly after exposure for 4 weeks. Histological examination revealed remarkable injuries in the proximal renal tubules, including tubular epithelial cell detachment, cloud swelling and vacuole formation in the proximal tubular cells, as well as proliferation of parietal epithelium and tubular reflux in glomeruli. Ultrastructural examination found that brush border and cytoplasm of tubular epithelial cell were dropped, that tubular epithelial cells were partially disintegrated, and that the mitochondria of tubular epithelial cells were degenerated and lost.

Though asymptomatic and relatively common, proteinuria in patients with sickle cell anemia (SS) over 40 years old is associated with reduced creatinine clearance. The subclinical increase in urinary albumin is termed microalbuminuria and is a marker of preclinical <b>glomerular</b> <b>damage.</b> The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the presence of microalbuminuria measured by radioimmunoassay in patients with sickle cell disease. The study included 41 patients with SS, 11 patients with hemoglobin SC disease, 4 subjects with S beta-thalassemia and 10 normal controls. All subjects were teenagers or adults. Sixteen SS patients (40 %) and 1 SC (9 %) and 1 S beta (25 %) patient presented mean urinary albumin excretion (UAE) above normal values (30 mg/l.

The frequency of desmin-positive cells among GECs varied between glomeruli {{in each of the}} strains and also differed between the four strains.

In aminonucleoside nephrosis, GECs showed extremely enhanced desmin staining in parallel with urinary protein excretion.

This procedure is not without complications. Complications include poor cardiac function, infection, gastrointestinal dysfunction, acute lung injury, stroke, and postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI). Among these complications postoperative AKI is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Several aspects of postoperative AKI in cardiac surgical patients were evaluated: the influence of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on perioperative renal function; the effects of dexamethasone on perioperative renal dysfunction; the impact of postoperative AKI on long-term survival. Perioperative renal damage was studied in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery with and without CPB. A transient renal injury was observed in CPB patients, as evidenced by a decrease in tubular function and increased level of biomarkers of <b>glomerular</b> and tubular <b>damage.</b> In the patients operated without CPB these parameters did not change. The effects of dexamethasone on perioperative renal dysfunction was evaluated in a randomized double-blind study. Perioperative renal function was evaluated by markers for both, <b>glomerular</b> function and <b>damage,</b> and for tubular function and damage. We found that dexamethasone does not exert a protective effect on the transient perioperative renal dysfunction that occurs in cardiac surgical patients undergoing CPB. In-hospital mortality and long-term survival (follow-up 13. 5 yr) was studied for patients with and without postoperative AKI in a cohort of cardiac surgical patients who underwent surgery in 1991.

Type 2 diabetic Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats in which diabetes was induced by high-fat diet/streptozotocin (HFD-STZ) were treated with different doses of metformin (150, 300, and 500 [*]mg/kg per day, resp.) for 8 weeks.
