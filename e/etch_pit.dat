40|$|The {{interaction}} of the 101 ¯ 4 cleavage surface of calcite with Hg(CH 3 COO) 2 aqueous solutions with concentration of 5 mM Hg(II) (pH ≈ 3. 5), was investigated using microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. In situ atomic force microscopy experiments showed that surface microtopography changes significantly {{as a result of}} the interaction, and that the initial rhombic <b>etch</b> <b>pits</b> induced by H 2 O dissolution are rapidly transformed to deeper <b>etch</b> <b>pits</b> exhibiting an unusual triangular shape. The growth of these <b>etch</b> <b>pits</b> is strongly anisotropic, moving faster along the [22 ¯ 1] direction than along the [010] direction (with step-retreat velocities of 12 nm s – 1 and 4 nm s– 1, respectively). The modified <b>etch</b> <b>pits</b> are due to Hg(II) sorption in the surface, rather than due to the effect of the acetate anion. The sorption (adsorption and probably absorption also) of Hg(II), in the first minutes of the interaction, is shown by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

40|$|InP on Si {{solar cells}} combine the {{low-cost}} and high-strength of Si {{with the high}} efficiency and radiation tolerance of InP. The main obstacle {{in the growth of}} single crystal InP-on-Si is the high residual strain and high dislocation density of the heteroepitaxial InP films. The dislocations result from the large differences in lattice constant and thermal expansion mismatch of InP and Si. Adjusting the size and geometry of the growth area is one possible method of addressing this problem. In this work, we conducted a material quality study of liquid phase epitaxy overgrowth layers on selective area InP grown by a proprietary vapor phase epitaxy technique on Si. The relationship between growth area and dislocation density was quantified using <b>etch</b> <b>pit</b> density measurements. Material quality of the InP on Si improved both with reduced growth area and increased aspect ratio (length/width) of the selective area.

The DCXRD results reveal various dislocation configurations on both types of PSSs. The <b>etch</b> <b>pits</b> of GaN on the recess PSS exhibit a regular distribution, i. e. less <b>etch</b> <b>pits</b> or threading dislocation density (TDD) onto the recess area than those onto the sapphire mesas.

A higher crystal quality of the GaN epilayer grown onto the recess PSS can be achieved as compared with that onto the protruding PSS. These data reflect that the GaN epilayer on the recess PSS could be a better template for the second epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELOG) of GaN.
