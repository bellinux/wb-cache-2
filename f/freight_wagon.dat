25|$|In March 1997, Tornado, as a {{completed}} frame and inside cylinder, was {{displayed in the}} Great Hall at the NRM for several weeks, transported from Tyseley by an EWS <b>freight</b> <b>wagon.</b> She returned to Tyseley to await completion of the Darlington works. The elements of Tornado were brought together {{with the opening of}} Darlington Locomotive Works in 1997, and the opening ceremony saw the unveiled locomotive, now consisting of the frame with its three cylinders and cab attached. Spring 1998 saw the smokebox construction started and the tyres fitted, and by 1999 forging of the motion components had started, with the first delivery of components commencing in January 2000.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rolling stock}} of BR was {{becoming}} increasingly obsolete {{and near the}} end of its life. An attempt at a cheap DMU replacement was made with the Pacer – essentially a modified bus body mounted on a rigid 4-wheel <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> chassis – which met with customer dissatisfaction. [...] However more successful stock such as the Sprinter DMU and Networker DMUs and EMUs were introduced.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} {{means of}} delivery was a 10 metre long cattle <b>freight</b> <b>wagon,</b> although third class passenger carriages were also used when the SS wanted {{to keep up the}} [...] "resettlement to work in the East" [...] myth, particularly in the Netherlands and in Belgium. The SS manual covered such trains, suggesting a carrying capacity per each trainset of 2,500 people in 50 cars, each boxcar loaded with 50 prisoners. In reality however, boxcars were crammed with up to 100 persons and routinely loaded from the minimum of 150% to 200% capacity. This resulted in an average of 5,000 people per trainset; 100 persons in each freight car multiplied by 50 cars. Notably, during the mass deportation of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka in 1942 trains carried up to 7,000 victims each.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1753, Virginia Governor Dinwiddie sent an eight-man mission {{headed by}} a young (21) George Washington to warn the French away from the Ohio Valley, and assert the claim of the Ohio Company. [...] From November 24 to 30, Washington held council with Tanacharison and Scarouady at Logstown. Returning to Virginia, Washington was made major and second-in-command of the Virginia Regiment, whilst Captain William Trent was sent with about 40 men along the Nemacolin Trail to the Monongahela River {{crossing}} ford at Redstone Old Fortsthe earliest point at which a <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> road could reach the Ohio River basinfor the Virginian plan was to seal control of the area by cutting and widening the trail from the Patomac River to build a blockhouse (later called Fort Hangard) they stocked with advanced supplies on the shore at Redstone Creek, ...|$|E
2500|$|Illness {{affected}} the Ursulines, too. In April 1885, Mother Amadeus fell ill with pneumonia. As her condition worsened, word reached the Ursuline convent in Toledo. Mary Fields, an African American ex-slave who had formerly been {{employed by the}} Dunne family as a servant, worked at the convent. When Mother Stanislaus journeyed to Montana to nurse Mother Amadeus, Fields accompanied her. Amadeus recovered, and Fields decided to stay in Montana. For the next eight years, she helped the sisters with farming, constructing buildings, running the laundry, and driving the <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> to nearby Cascade. Known as [...] "Stagecoach Mary," [...] she cursed, smoked cigars, drank liquor, carried a loaded firearm, and fought anyone who gave her the slightest insult. In 1894 Bishop Brondel demanded that Fields leave the mission after she fought a duel in Helena {{with a man who}} insulted her. Estranged from the church by Brondel's decision, Fields moved to nearby Cascade. Mother Amadeus provided her with funds to open a restaurant. When the restaurant later failed, Mother Amadeus helped Fields win a job as a mail carrier.|$|E

Mame is waiting for a <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> that is going to take her to Oklahoma, but I condemns the <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> with promptness and scorn, and offers to deliver the goods myself. Ma Dugan sees no reason why not, as Mr. Freighter wants pay for the job; so, thirty minutes later Mame and I pull out in my light spring wagon with white canvas cover, and head due south.|$|E

And the best proof {{of it is}} that they've lately been robbing {{ordinary}} passengers' trunks. There was a <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> 'held up' near Dow's Flat the other day, and a lot of baggage gone through. I had to go down there to look into it. Darned if they hadn't lifted a lot o' woman's wedding things from that rich couple who got married the other day out at Marysville. Looks as if they were playing it rather low down, don't it? Coming down to hardpan and the bed rock--eh?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} Mr. Payne, of Georgetown, and I started on our return. We got along {{very well for}} a few miles, when we {{encountered}} a ferocious dog that frightened the horses and made them run. The new animal kicked at every jump he made. I got the horses stopped, however, before any damage was done, and without running into anything. After giving them a little rest, to quiet their fears, we started again. That instant the new horse kicked, and started to run once more. The road we were on, struck the turnpike within half a mile of {{the point where the}} second runaway commenced, and there there was an embankment twenty or more feet deep {{on the opposite side of}} the pike. I got the horses stopped on the very brink of the precipice. My new horse was terribly frightened and trembled like an aspen; but he was not half so badly frightened as my companion, Mr. Payne, who deserted me after this last experience, and took passage on a <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> for Maysville. Every time I attempted to start, my new horse would commence to kick. I was in quite a dilemma for a time. Once in Maysville I could borrow a horse from an uncle who lived there; but I was more than a day's travel from that point. Finally I took out my bandanna--the style of handkerchief in universal use then--and with this blindfolded my horse. In this way I reached Maysville safely the next day, no doubt much to the surprise of my friend. Here I borrowed a horse from my uncle, and the following day we proceeded on our journey.|$|E
