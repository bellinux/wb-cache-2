While {{the results of the}} dictionary use study may be successfully fed back into the compilation, the semi-automatic analysis of the use itself for the first time reveals how electronic dictionaries are really used. In order to achieve this, an intricate and multifaceted integrated log file tracks every single action of every single user – <b>date</b> and <b>time</b> <b>stamping</b> each lookup, ordering founds and not-founds, monitoring long-term vocabulary retention, etc. – with a multitude of summaries being presented to the lexicographers.

40|$|In linking Iliad to an {{electronic}} medical record (EMR) as a knowledge server, our objective is to convert the <b>date</b> and <b>time</b> <b>stamped</b> data from the EMR to the temporal representations existing in the Iliad knowledge base. First, an empirical analysis of Iliad's temporal information content is described: categorizing, estimating the amount (22 %), and offering a temporal template to canonically represent it. Second, we analyze the effect of history and physical examination temporal information on the diagnostic performance of the system using data from 241 real cases. Third, we discuss knowledge engineering mapping techniques to convert time information found in EMRs. We conclude that the Iliad system includes {{a large amount of}} explicit and implicit time information and this information improves the system's diagnostic accuracy, both in terms of diagnosis ranking and confidence...|$|R
50|$|Because of {{problems}} with dating, it is problematic to work out when these people might have lived. Are Frode, in the 1100s, was probably {{the first person who}} tried to convert the <b>dates</b> from relative <b>time</b> <b>stamps</b> to absolute chronological dates on the basis of Jesus' birth; the reckoning began to be used during the Middle Ages and is still in use. Are dated Harald Fairhair's birth to 848, and until the 1920s historians used Are's reckoning to calculate the composition <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> for different people and events. In 1921 historian Halvdan Koht introduced generation counting and his method became the dominant one. In 1964, Icelandic historian Olafia Einarsdottir found the old Icelandic reckoning more accurate; with adjustments this has since been the most commonly used approach.|$|R
50|$|Norton UNERASE was an {{important}} component in Norton Utilities version 1.0 in 1982. Microsoft included a similar UNDELETE program in versions 5.0 to 6.22 of MS-DOS, but applied the Recycle Bin approach instead in later operating systems using FAT. DR DOS 6.0 and higher support UNDELETE as well, but optionally offer additional protection utilizing the FAT snapshot utility DISKMAP and the resident DELWATCH deletion tracking component, which actively maintains deleted files' <b>date</b> and <b>time</b> <b>stamps</b> and keeps the contents of deleted files from being overwritten unless running out of disk space. DELWATCH also supports undeletion of remote files on file servers. Since Novell DOS 7 the kernel will store the first letter of deleted files in the directory entries {{in order to further}} assist undeletion tools in recovering the original name. PTS-DOS offers the same feature, configurable by a SAVENAME CONFIG.SYS directive.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Apple’s iOS {{is one of}} {{the major}} players in the {{smartphone}} market and it restricts installation of apps which are not from Apple app store. Users often resort to jailbreak their iPhones to break free from these restrictions. Considering jailbreaking iPhones is legal in the US; more devices are expected to be jailbroken in future. Jailbroken iPhones are making their way into enterprises, which allow Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), but these devices are either barred or restricted by Mobile Device Management (MDM) softwares which consider them as a security risk. In this work, we have designed a solution (iSecureRing) to secure mobile apps and to preserve <b>date</b> and <b>time</b> <b>stamps</b> of events to handle any security incidents in the jailbroken iPhones. To the best of our knowledge, iSecureRing is the first forensic ready mobile app security solution to secure an application running in an unsecure environment within the enterprise environment.

40|$|Though not {{especially}} media-rich, mailing lists remain in use and retain popularity for their builtin technological controls and their capability to “reply ” to a message (“continuing a thread”). The motivation for extracting knowledge fragments from the unstructured text of mailing lists is compelling, though successes doing so {{may be considered}} only partial because it requires mental processing, or a certain cognitive effort, that complicates automation. Cognitive psychology distinguishes the Long Term Memory (LTM), which may be compared to text thread storage, from the Working Memory (WM), which initiates the retrieval of knowledge fragments stored in the LTM. Searching by subject, <b>date,</b> and <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> ranges, and by keyword-inclusive fragments, constitutes the commonly used methods for executing sequential LTM retrieval. Retrieval can, however, be greatly enhanced by automatically gleaning certain classes of threads from the entire structure and displaying them alongside other properties. Here, we describe automatic “class ” extraction {{and its effect on}} OM manufacturing and LTM retrieval...|$|R
5000|$|With {{the onset}} of the Internet and {{electronic}} equipment such as the personal computers and cell-phones, legal instruments or formal legal documents have undergone a progressive change of dematerialisation. In this electronic age, document authentication can now be verified digitally using various software. All documents needing authentication can be processed as digital documents with all the necessary information such as <b>date</b> and <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> imbedded. To prevent tampering or unauthorized changes to the original document, encryption is used. In modern times, authentication is no longer limited to the type of paper used, the specialized seal, stamps, etc., as document authentication software helps secure the original context. The use of electronic legal documents is most prominent in the United States' courts. Most United States' courts prefer the filing of electronic legal documents over paper. However, there is not yet a public law to unify the different standards of document authentication. Therefore, one must know the court's requirement before filing court papers.|$|R
40|$|The {{limitations}} of paper-and-pencil self-monitoring (PM) are {{leading to the}} use of more sophisticated techniques. PM was compared with cellular phone monitoring (CM) to collect ecological momentary assessment data on alcohol use. Twenty social drinkers were randomly assigned to the 2 groups, and their drinking was monitored for 14 days. PM participants recorded data on cards. CM participants carried telephones and responded to an interactive voice response system. The authors found few significant group differences in alcohol use, compliance with the self-monitoring, and satisfaction. However, CM had useful advantages, including instantaneous entry of data into a central database, <b>date</b> and <b>time</b> <b>stamping</b> of data, and easy integration into daily life. Although preliminary, this study suggests that CM is a promising alternative to PM. Paper-and-pencil self-monitoring (PM) is a common technique for gathering data on behaviors such as drinking and internal states such as mood. In PM, participants enter data on cards or diaries whenever the target behavior occurs. Although PM has the limitation of relying on self-report, it usually proves as effective, or more effective, than other traditional methods of measuring alcohol consumptio...|$|R
40|$|The Material Control and Accountability (MC and A) Group has {{developed}} an electronic scan system to acknowledge issuance and returns of Tamper Indicating Device (TID) seals. Important MC and A features of the system are: 1. The system requires the issuer identification and the identification of applicators to be entered, thereby ensuring {{that at least two}} qualified issuers and applicators possess the seals. Also, Operations is prompted to ensure the Two Person Rule is met during issuance and application of the seals. 2. All input is <b>date</b> and <b>time</b> <b>stamped</b> to ease resolution of anomalies. 3. The system requires all information to be input before allowing the user to logoff, thereby eliminating the problem of incomplete information in the records. 4. The input is immediately available to FBL MC and A personnel outside the facility who then know to expect completed procedures and forms regarding these transactions. The paper will describe the application of these features in routine operations as well as the development effort and final configuration of the system...|$|R
40|$|Published data, {{whether in}} {{traditional}} publication formats such as research articles or in databases often lack a consensus structure (which slows search and reasoning) and provenance and citation models (which lowers incentive for publication [1]). Furthermore, in some disciplines the growing rate of data production exceeds {{the capacity of}} human comprehension. Together, these trends lead {{to the loss of}} valuable data from scientific discourse. Nanopublication is a data publication model built on top of existing Semantic Web technologies to counter these data dissemination and management trends [2]. A nanopublication represents the smallest unit of publishable information and consists of an (i) assertion and (ii) provenance [3]. The assertion takes the form of one or more semantic triples (subject-predicate-object combination). The provenance describes how the assertion ‘came to be’, and includes supporting information (e. g., context, parameter settings, a description of methods) and attribution to the authors (of content) and creators (of the nanopublication), institutions supporting the work, funding sources and other information like <b>date</b> and <b>time</b> <b>stamps</b> and certification. Creating a nanopublication requires a one-time effort to model the assertion and provenance as RDF named graphs [3]. After submission to an open, decentralized nanopublicatio...|$|R
