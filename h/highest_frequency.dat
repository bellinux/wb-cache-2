These are not only particular, specialised species; according to an overview study, more than 150 species were found in the arctic and subarctic regions of Iceland, Greenland, northern Russia and Alaska. These distinctly exceed the tree line. In Greenland, the habitat may reach the 77th latitude line. The Myxogastria species reach their largest biodiversity and <b>highest</b> <b>frequency</b> in forests of temperate regions, which are ideal habitats because of the amount of rich organic material, suitable humidity (not too high) and long-lasting snow cover for snow-inhabiting species.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Cold War era, {{radar and}} antenna related {{applications}} remained a prominent research activity in EES' {{contracts with the}} Defense Department. Millimeter wave radar research, in particular, was prominent in EES' defense activities from the late 1950s, when the first military-designation millimeter wave radar was built at Georgia Tech, to the 1980s, when GTRI developed {{what was then the}} world's <b>highest</b> <b>frequency</b> microwave radar. EES' high-frequency radar research found applications in radio astronomy, meteorology and climate studies, which improved weather forecasting and climate models and assisted in NASA's planning of the Cassini and Galileo missions. Expansion of EES' antenna research in the 1970s, in particular, the development of an air defense antenna for the U.S. Army Missile Command, resulted in the establishment of the Huntsville Research Laboratory, GTRI's oldest off-campus research center.|$|E

5|$|A {{more complex}} example of stepped {{impedance}} design {{is presented in}} figure 6. Again, narrow lines are used to implement inductors and wide lines correspond to capacitors, but in this case, the lumped-element counterpart has resonators connected in shunt across the main line. This topology {{can be used to}} design elliptical filters or Chebyshev filters with poles of attenuation in the stopband. However, calculating component values for these structures is an involved process and has led to designers often choosing to implement them as m-derived filters instead, which perform well and are much easier to calculate. The purpose of incorporating resonators is to improve the stopband rejection. However, beyond the resonant frequency of the <b>highest</b> <b>frequency</b> resonator, the stopband rejection starts to deteriorate as the resonators are moving towards open-circuit. For this reason, filters built to this design often have an additional single stepped-impedance capacitor as the final element of the filter. This also ensures good rejection at high frequency.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{are divided}} over whether climate change, hunting, or a {{combination}} of the two, drove the extinction of the Columbian mammoths. According to the climate change hypothesis, warmer weather led to the shrinking of suitable habitat for Columbian mammoths, which turned from parkland to forest, grassland and semi-desert, with less diverse vegetation. The overkill hypothesis, on the other hand, attributes the extinction to hunting by humans. This idea was first proposed by Paul S. Martin in 1967; more recent research on this subject have varied in their conclusions. A 2002 study concluded that the archaeological record did not support the overkill hypothesis, given that only 14 Clovis sites (12 with mammoth remains and two with mastodon remains) out of 76 examined provided strong evidence of hunting. In contrast, a 2007 study found that the Clovis record indicated the <b>highest</b> <b>frequency</b> of prehistoric exploitation of proboscideans for subsistence in the world, and supported the overkill hypothesis. Whatever the actual cause of extinction, large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{barriers}} to access, health services {{have shown a}} trend toward improvement {{over the past twenty}} years. Child immunizations against such diseases as hepatitis B, diphtheria and measles increased an average of 60percent in this period, indicating low but increasing availability of basic medical services and treatments. The Malagasy fertility rate in 2009 was 4.6children per woman, declining from 6.3 in 1990. Teen pregnancy rates of 14.8percent in 2011, much higher than the African average, are a contributing factor to rapid population growth. In 2010 the maternal mortality rate was 440 per 100,000 births, compared to 373.1 in 2008 and 484.4 in 1990, indicating a decline in perinatal care following the 2009 coup. The infant mortality rate in 2011 was 41 per 1,000 births, with an under-five mortality rate at 61 per 1,000 births. Schistosomiasis, malaria and sexually transmitted diseases are common in Madagascar, although infection rates of AIDS remain low relative to many countries in mainland Africa, at only 0.2percent of the adult population. The malaria mortality rate is also among the lowest in Africa at 8.5 deaths per 100,000people, in part due to the <b>highest</b> <b>frequency</b> use of insecticide treated nets in Africa. Adult life expectancy in 2009 was 63 years for men and 67years for women.|$|E

5|$|People {{may simply}} like most {{what they see}} most. Letters that appear more {{frequently}} in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found {{a positive correlation between}} the frequency of occurrence of letters and phonemes and how attractive they were judged to be. Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more you like it. Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not. He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters. In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the <b>highest</b> <b>frequency</b> letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> trading in {{financial}} markets based on a model with three types of traders: liquidity traders, market makers, and <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> traders. Our four main findings are: i) The price impact of the liquidity trades is higher {{in the presence of}} the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> trader and is increasing with the size of the trade. In particular, we show that the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> trader reduces (increases) the prices that liquidity traders receive when selling (buying) their equity holdings. ii) Although market makers also lose revenue to the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> trader in every trade, they are compensated for these losses by a higher liquidity discount. iii) <b>High</b> <b>frequency</b> trading increases the volatility of prices. iv) The volume of trades doubles as the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> trader intermediates all trades between the liquidity traders and market makers. This additional volume is a consequence of trades which are carefully tailored for surplus extraction and are neither driven by fundamentals nor is it noise trading.

Analysis of the vector magnitude in the temporal domain (25 to 250 Hz bandpass filters) measured <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> QRS duration, the duration of terminal signals 25 Hz that were < 40 μV. Analysis in the frequency domain used a 120 ms window that encompassed (had onset with) all of the late potential, but the mean value was first subtracted to eliminate a direct current component. <b>High</b> <b>frequency</b> spectral areas (60 to 120 Hz) and the percent <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> (100 × [60 to 120 Hz/ 0 to 120 Hz]) were calculated. Results in both temporal and frequency domains were similar in control patients with coronary artery disease and normal subjects. Patients with ventricular tachycardia had a longer <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> QRS complex (p < 0. 0001) and longer <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> terminal signals < 40 μV (p < 0. 0004), but not significantly lower voltage in the last 40 ms. The most useful temporal domain measurement was <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> QRS duration (if ≥ 120 ms, odds ratio = 8. 2). Patients with ventricular tachycardia had increased <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> spectral areas (p < 0. 0002) in the late potential, and the percent <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> was especially increased (p = 0. 0000; if percent <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> ≥ 3. 1 %, odds ratio = 18. 4).
