5|$|A <b>decompression</b> {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} calculate the <b>decompression</b> stops needed for a particular dive profile {{to reduce the risk of}} <b>decompression</b> sickness occurring after surfacing at the end of a dive. The algorithm can be used to generate <b>decompression</b> schedules for a particular dive profile, <b>decompression</b> tables for more general use, or be implemented in dive computer software.|$|E
5|$|A <b>decompression</b> {{schedule}} is a specified ascent rate and series of increasingly shallower <b>decompression</b> stops—often for {{increasing amounts of}} time—that a diver performs to outgas inert gases from their body during ascent to the surface {{to reduce the risk}} of <b>decompression</b> sickness. In a <b>decompression</b> dive, the <b>decompression</b> phase may make up a large part of the time spent underwater (in many cases it is longer than the actual time spent at depth).|$|E
5|$|A <b>decompression</b> {{station is}} a place set up to {{facilitate}} the planned <b>decompression</b> for a dive team.|$|E
5|$|A <b>decompression</b> stop is {{a period}} a diver must spend at a {{relatively}} shallow constant depth during ascent after a dive to safely eliminate absorbed inert gases from the body tissues to avoid <b>decompression</b> sickness. The practice of making <b>decompression</b> stops is called staged <b>decompression,</b> as opposed to continuous <b>decompression.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{procedure}} {{for dealing with}} omitted <b>decompression</b> stops is described in the US Navy Diving Manual. In principle the procedure allows a diver who is not yet presenting symptoms of <b>decompression</b> sickness, to go back down and complete the omitted <b>decompression,</b> with some extra added {{to deal with the}} bubbles which are assumed to have formed during the period where the <b>decompression</b> ceiling was violated. Divers who become symptomatic before they can be returned to depth are treated for <b>decompression</b> sickness, and do not attempt the omitted <b>decompression</b> procedure as the risk is considered unacceptable under normal operational circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Basic <b>decompression</b> {{theory and}} use of <b>decompression</b> tables {{is part of the}} theory {{component}} of training for commercial divers, and dive planning based on <b>decompression</b> tables, and the practice and field management of <b>decompression</b> is {{a significant part of the}} work of the diving supervisor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Decompression</b> may be {{continuous}} or staged, {{where the}} ascent {{is interrupted by}} stops at regular depth intervals, but the entire ascent {{is part of the}} <b>decompression,</b> and ascent rate can be critical to harmless elimination of inert gas. What is commonly known as no-decompression diving, or more accurately no-stop <b>decompression,</b> relies on limiting ascent rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation. Staged <b>decompression</b> may include deep stops depending on the theoretical model used for calculating the ascent schedule. Omission of <b>decompression</b> theoretically required for a dive profile exposes the diver to significantly higher risk of symptomatic <b>decompression</b> sickness, and in severe cases, serious injury or death. The risk is related to the severity of exposure and the level of supersaturation of tissues in the diver. Procedures for emergency management of omitted <b>decompression</b> and symptomatic <b>decompression</b> sickness have been published. These procedures are generally effective, but vary in effectiveness from case to case.|$|E
5|$|<b>Decompression</b> {{software}} {{is available for}} personal computers to model the <b>decompression</b> requirements of user specified dive profiles with different gas mixtures using a choice of <b>decompression</b> algorithms. Schedules generated by <b>decompression</b> software represent a diver's specific dive plan and breathing gas mixtures. It is usual to generate a schedule for the planned profile {{and for the most}} likely contingency profiles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Decompression</b> {{software}} such as Departure, DecoPlanner, Ultimate Planner, Z-Planner, V-Planner and GAP are available, which {{simulate the}} <b>decompression</b> requirements of different dive profiles with different gas mixtures using <b>decompression</b> algorithms.|$|E
5|$|<b>Decompression</b> stops {{are done}} at 9m and 6m, {{and at the}} surface, as surface {{interval}} is considered a <b>decompression</b> period.|$|E
5|$|<b>Decompression</b> {{which follows}} the {{procedure}} of relatively fast ascent interrupted by periods at constant depth {{is known as}} staged <b>decompression.</b> The ascent rate and the depth and duration of the stops are integral parts of the <b>decompression</b> process. The advantage of staged <b>decompression</b> {{is that it is}} far easier to monitor and control than continuous <b>decompression.</b>|$|E
5|$|Early <b>decompression</b> theory {{generally}} {{assumed that}} inert gas bubble {{formation in the}} tissues could be avoided during <b>decompression,</b> and {{the aim of the}} <b>decompression</b> tables and algorithms was to prevent bubble formation while minimising <b>decompression</b> time. Most dissolved phase models are perfusion limited, and differ mainly by the number of compartments, the range of half-times, and supersaturation tolerances assumed. These models are commonly referred to as Haldanean.|$|E
5|$|Equipment for {{planning}} and monitoring <b>decompression</b> includes <b>decompression</b> tables, surface computer software and personal <b>decompression</b> computers. There is {{a wide range of}} choice.|$|E
5|$|Further work {{showed that}} it was {{possible}} to avoid symptoms by slow <b>decompression,</b> and subsequently various theoretical models have been derived to predict safe <b>decompression</b> profiles and treatment of <b>decompression</b> sickness.|$|E
5|$|If a <b>decompression</b> chamber is available, omitted <b>decompression</b> may {{be managed}} by chamber {{recompression}} to an appropriate pressure, and <b>decompression</b> following either a surface <b>decompression</b> schedule or a treatment table. If the diver develops symptoms in the chamber, treatment can be started without further delay.|$|E
5|$|Normal diving <b>decompression</b> {{procedures}} {{range from}} continuous ascent for no-stop dives, where the necessary <b>decompression</b> occurs during the ascent, which is {{kept to a}} controlled rate for this purpose, through staged <b>decompression</b> in open water or in a bell, to <b>decompression</b> from saturation, which generally occurs in a <b>decompression</b> chamber {{that is part of}} a saturation system. <b>Decompression</b> may be accelerated by the use of breathing gases that provide an increased concentration differential of the inert gas components of the breathing mixture by maximizing the acceptable oxygen content.|$|E
5|$|Recreational divers {{are trained}} in the theory and {{practice}} of <b>decompression</b> {{to the extent that the}} certifying agency specifies in the training standard for each certification. This may vary from a rudimentary overview sufficient to allow the diver to avoid <b>decompression</b> obligation for entry level divers, to competence in the use of several <b>decompression</b> algorithms by way of personal dive computers, <b>decompression</b> software, and tables for advanced technical divers. The detailed understanding of <b>decompression</b> theory is not generally required of either commercial or recreational divers.|$|E
5|$|The ascent is an {{important}} part of the process of <b>decompression,</b> as this is the time when reduction of ambient pressure occurs, and it is of critical importance to safe <b>decompression</b> that the ascent rate is compatible with safe elimination of inert gas from the diver's tissues. Ascent rate must be limited to prevent supersaturation of tissues to the extent that unacceptable bubble development occurs. This is usually done by specifying a maximum ascent rate compatible with the <b>decompression</b> model chosen. This will be specified in the <b>decompression</b> tables or the user manual for the <b>decompression</b> software or personal <b>decompression</b> computer. The instructions will usually include contingency procedures for deviation from the specified rate, both for delays and exceeding the recommended rate. Failure to comply with these specifications will generally increase the risk of <b>decompression</b> sickness.|$|E
5|$|The <b>decompression</b> {{schedule}} may {{be derived}} from <b>decompression</b> tables, <b>decompression</b> software, or from dive computers, and these are commonly based upon a mathematical model of the body's uptake and release of inert gas as pressure changes. These models, such as the Bühlmann <b>decompression</b> algorithm, are designed to fit empirical data and provide a <b>decompression</b> schedule for a given depth and dive duration.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the dive}} site and {{underwater}} topography permit, divers often prefer to descend to maximum depth and slowly ascend throughout the dive. A slow ascent, and therefore slow pressure reduction, {{is a good}} <b>decompression</b> practice. When using a dive computer this type of profile may not require additional <b>decompression</b> stops. Dive computers, unlike <b>decompression</b> tables, measure depth and time at short intervals during the dive and calculate the exact <b>decompression</b> indicated by the <b>decompression</b> model, which for a multilevel profile will be less than for the square profile with the same maximum depth and duration.|$|E
5|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} successful <b>decompression</b> {{is that the}} depth and ascent rate of the diver must be monitored and sufficiently accurately controlled. Practical in-water <b>decompression</b> requires a reasonable tolerance for variation in depth and rate of ascent, but unless the <b>decompression</b> is being monitored in real time by a <b>decompression</b> computer, any deviations from the nominal profile will affect the risk. Several items of equipment are used to assist in facilitating accurate adherence to the planned profile, by allowing the diver to more easily control depth and ascent rate, or to transfer this control to specialist personnel at the surface.|$|E
5|$|A deck <b>decompression</b> chamber is {{intended}} for surface <b>decompression</b> and emergency hyperbaric treatment of divers, but {{can be used for}} other hyperbaric treatment under the appropriate supervision of hyperbaric medical personnel.|$|E
5|$|A <b>decompression</b> trapeze is {{a device}} used in {{recreational}} diving and technical diving to make <b>decompression</b> stops {{more comfortable and}} more secure and provide the divers' surface cover with a visual reference for the divers' position.|$|E
5|$|A <b>decompression</b> trapeze is {{a device}} used in {{recreational}} diving and technical diving to make <b>decompression</b> stops {{more comfortable and}} more secure and provide the divers' surface cover with a visual reference for the divers' position. It consists of a horizontal bar or bars suspended at the depth of intended <b>decompression</b> stops by buoys. The bars are of sufficient weight and the buoys of sufficient buoyancy that the trapeze will not easily change depth in turbulent water or if the divers experience buoyancy control problems.|$|E
5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} <b>decompression</b> stop {{increases the risk}} of developing <b>decompression</b> sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes of missing <b>decompression</b> stops. Diving suit failure in cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and <b>decompression</b> sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver is willing to carry out.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of <b>decompression</b> {{experiments}} were done using goats, which were compressed for three hours to assumed saturation, rapidly decompressed to surface pressure, and examined for symptoms of <b>decompression</b> sickness. Goats which had been compressed to 2.25 bar absolute or less {{showed no signs of}} DCS after rapid <b>decompression</b> to the surface. Goats compressed to 6 bar and rapidly decompressed to 2.6 bar (pressure ratio 2.3 to 1) also showed no signs of DCS. Haldane and his co-workers concluded that a <b>decompression</b> from saturation with a pressure ratio of 2 to 1 was unlikely to produce symptoms.|$|E
5|$|A {{saturation}} {{profile is}} one {{which all the}} tissues considered by the <b>decompression</b> model have become saturated with inert gas from the breathing mixture. Most <b>decompression</b> models will take this to be at six tissue half-times for the slowest tissue considered. Further bottom time at the same depth will not affect the inert gas loading of any tissue and will not affect the <b>decompression</b> required.|$|E
5|$|A second {{scenario}} considers pressure increases during <b>decompression</b> {{that reduce}} bubble diameters. This can allow bubbles {{trapped in the}} lung during a normal <b>decompression</b> to suddenly pass through the capillaries and become responsible for Type II DCS symptoms. This could explain the difference in outcomes of in-water <b>decompression</b> versus surface <b>decompression.</b> Data collected in the North Sea have shown that if the overall incidence rate of the two diving methods is about the same, that surface <b>decompression</b> tends to produce ten times more type II DCS than in-water <b>decompression.</b> It is assumed that when the diver ascends to the surface, bubbles are produced that are trapped by the lung capillaries, and on recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, these bubbles are reduced in diameter and pass to the arterial side, later causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after sawtooth diving profiles or multiple repetitive dives.|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} changes due {{to change}} of altitude {{before or after}} diving can have a significant influence on <b>decompression</b> risk. Diving at high altitude requires special consideration in <b>decompression</b> planning. Such variations in ambient pressure caused by flying or surface travel involving changes in altitude will affect <b>decompression</b> and should be considered during dive planning and therefore may influence a planned dive profile.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles {{are assumed}} to form after every <b>decompression.</b>|$|E
5|$|Comparisons of VPM {{profiles}} with USN <b>decompression</b> schedules for extreme exposure dives consistently produce similar total ascent times, but significantly deeper first <b>decompression</b> stops.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} in the North Sea {{have shown that the}} overall incidence of <b>decompression</b> sickness for in-water and surface <b>decompression</b> is similar, but surface <b>decompression</b> tends to produce ten times more type II (neurological) DCS than in-water <b>decompression.</b> A possible explanation is that during the final stage of ascent, bubbles are produced that are stopped in the lung capillaries. During recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, the diameter of some of these bubbles is reduced sufficiently that they pass through the pulmonary capillaries and reach the systemic circulation on the arterial side, later lodging in systemic capillaries and causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after sawtooth profile diving or multiple repetitive diving.|$|E
5|$|Deck <b>decompression</b> {{chambers}} {{are used}} for surface <b>decompression,</b> described in a previous section. Most deck <b>decompression</b> chambers are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathing gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E
5|$|<b>Decompression</b> from a {{saturation}} dive {{is a slow}} process. The rate of <b>decompression</b> typically ranges between 3 and 6fsw (0.9 and 1.8msw) per hour.|$|E
5|$|<b>Decompression</b> may be {{continuous}} or staged, {{where the}} ascent {{is interrupted by}} stops at regular depth intervals, but the entire ascent {{is part of the}} <b>decompression,</b> and ascent rate can be critical to harmless elimination of inert gas. What is commonly known as no-decompression diving, or more accurately no-stop <b>decompression,</b> relies on limiting ascent rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Decompression</b> {{sickness}} (DCS; {{also known}} as divers' disease, the bends or caisson disease) describes a condition arising from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation. DCS most commonly refers to problems arising from underwater diving <b>decompression</b> (i.e., during ascent), but may be experienced in other depressurisation events such as emerging from a caisson, flying in an unpressurised aircraft at altitude, and extravehicular activity from spacecraft. DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as <b>decompression</b> illness.|$|E
