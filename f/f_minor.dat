5|$|During the 1930s, the {{orchestra}} became {{renowned for its}} high standard of playing and for performing new and unfamiliar music. The pioneering work of Boult and the BBC SO included an early performance of Schoenberg's Variations, Op. 31, British premieres, including Berg's Wozzeck and Three Movements from the Lyric Suite, and world premieres, including Vaughan Williams's Symphony No. 4 in <b>F</b> <b>minor.</b> Anton Webern conducted eight BBC SO concerts between 1931 and 1936.|$|E
5|$|The chord pattern differs little {{throughout}} the song. On guitar, {{it consists of}} the chords (played with a capo at the fifth fret) of B minor 7, <b>F</b> <b>minor,</b> A minor 7, F, C, E sus. 7 and E7. A variation from this sequence occurs during the repeated last line of each second verse, {{with the addition of}} the chords D7/F and F major 7.|$|E
5|$|The Eocene frigatebird genus Limnofregata {{comprises}} birds whose fossil {{remains were}} recovered from prehistoric freshwater environments, unlike the marine preferences of their modern-day relatives. They had shorter less-hooked bills and longer legs, and longer slit-like nasal openings. Three {{species have been}} described from fossil deposits in the western United States, two—L. azygosternon and L. hasegawai—from the Green River Formation (48–52 million years old) and one—L. hutchisoni—from the Wasatch Formation (between 53 and 55 million years of age). Fossil material indistinguishable from living species dating to the Pleistocene and Holocene has been recovered from Ascension Island (for F. aquila), Saint Helena Island, both in the southern Atlantic Ocean, and also from various islands in the Pacific Ocean (for <b>F.</b> <b>minor</b> and F. ariel).|$|E

5|$|The two became friends, and {{for many}} years lived in close {{proximity}} in Paris, Chopin at 38 Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin, and Liszt at the Hôtel de France on the Rue Lafitte, a few blocks away. They performed together on seven occasions between 1833 and 1841. The first, on 2 April 1833, was at a benefit concert organized by Hector Berlioz for his bankrupt Shakespearean actress wife Harriet Smithson, during which they played George Onslow's Sonata in <b>F</b> <b>minor</b> for piano duet. Later joint appearances included a benefit concert for the Benevolent Association of Polish Ladies in Paris. Their last appearance together in public was for a charity concert conducted for the Beethoven Memorial in Bonn, held at the Salle Pleyel and the Paris Conservatory on 25 and 26 April 1841.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Hassinger still {{owned the}} rights to The Electric Prunes's name, and was {{encouraged}} {{by the success of}} Mass in <b>F</b> <b>Minor,</b> which prompted him to assemble a new line-up. He was steered toward the Colorado group, Climax, by Rich Fifield. Fifield had worked in fellow Colorado band, Hardwater (previously the surf rock band The Astronauts), which was managed by Poncher, and produced an album with Axelrod. The new Electric Prunes line-up included Climax members Richard Whetstone (vocals, guitar), John Herron (organ), and Mark Kincaid (guitar) with Brett Wade (bass guitar), who was recommended by The Collectors. With the group restructured, Axelrod, again, composed all the material for their next album, in the same vein as the previous effort, and centered it around the Jewish prayer, Kol Nidre. The album, titled Release of an Oath, utilized several session musicians including Howard Roberts, Carol Kaye, and Earl Palmer, and saw Whetstone as the only band member to contribute to the recordings. Although the album was considered more cohesive and progressive than its predecessor, it failed to chart upon its release in November 1968. Afterwards, Axelrod returned to his past position at Capitol Records, and The Electric Prunes toured as a supporting act for bands such as Steppenwolf, Canned Heat, and New Buffalo Springfield.|$|E

25|$|Bruckner {{composed}} eleven symphonies, the first, the Study Symphony in <b>F</b> <b>minor</b> in 1863, the last, {{the unfinished}} Symphony No. 9 in D minor in 1893-1896.

25|$|In parallel, Wetz {{worked on}} his two string quartets in <b>F</b> <b>minor</b> (op. 43) and E minor (op. 49). Afterwards, he devoted himself to working on choral pieces. Thus {{originated}} the Requiem in B minor (op. 50) and the Christmas Oratorio on Old-German poems (op. 53), possibly his most significant compositions. Wetz also wrote monographs about models Anton Bruckner (1922) and Franz Liszt (1925) as well as Ludwig van Beethoven (1927).|$|E
25|$|The First Piano Sonata in <b>F</b> <b>minor,</b> Op. 5, is a four-movement {{work from}} 1901–3 {{suggesting}} {{the style of}} Scriabin or Rachmaninoff, but nonetheless original. Medtner's craft gained subtlety and complexity in later years, but this work is already evidence of his mastery of musical structure. An opening Allegro, dramatic and imbued like much Russian music with a bell-like sonority, is separated by a Intermezzo from a Largo divoto that reaches a Maestoso climax before plunging into the headlong Allegro risoluto finale.|$|E

25|$|Coot fossils {{from the}} Middle Pleistocene of California have been {{described}} as Fulica hesterna but cannot be separated from the present-day American coot. However, the Pleistocene coot Fulica shufeldti (formerly <b>F.</b> <b>minor),</b> famously known as part of the Fossil Lake fauna, quite possibly was a paleosubspecies of the American coot (as Fulica americana shufeldti) as they only differed marginally in size and proportions from living birds. Thus, it seems that the modern-type American coots evolved during the mid-late Pleistocene, a few hundred thousand years ago.|$|E
25|$|The song {{begins with}} a distinctive, wailing cry from Plant and is built on a repeating, staccato riff by guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. It is {{performed}} in the key of <b>F</b> <b>minor</b> at a moderate tempo of 112 beats per minute. There is a very faint count-off {{at the beginning of}} the track with lots of hiss which appears on the album version, but is trimmed from the single version. The hiss is feedback from an echo unit.|$|E
25|$|Careful {{choice of}} key {{was also a}} crucial factor in Hasse's style, with certain {{emotions}} usually marked out by certain key choices. Amorous feelings were expressed by A, for instance, while for expressions of aristocratic nobility Hasse used C and B flat; on the other hand, his supernatural and fear-inducing music usually went into the keys of C and <b>F</b> <b>minor.</b> Most of his arias begin in the major, switching only to minor for the B section before returning to major for the da capo. As his career developed his arias grew much longer but a lyrical sense was still his overriding target.|$|E

25|$|Unusually for a {{composer}} of such importance and reputation, Franck's fame rests largely {{on a small}} number of compositions written in his later years, particularly his Symphony in D minor (1886–88), the Symphonic Variations for piano and orchestra (1885), the Prelude, Chorale and Fugue for piano solo (1884), the Sonata for Violin and Piano in A major (1886), the Piano Quintet in <b>F</b> <b>minor</b> (1879), and the symphonic poem Le Chasseur maudit (1883). The Symphony was especially admired and influential among the younger generation of French composers and was highly responsible for reinvigorating the French symphonic tradition after years of decline. One of his best known shorter works is the motet setting Panis Angelicus, which was originally written for tenor solo with organ and string accompaniment, but has also been arranged for other voices and instrumental combinations.|$|E
25|$|The early Romantic composers {{had a major}} {{influence}} on Brahms, particularly Schumann, who encouraged Brahms as a young composer. During his stay in Vienna in 1862–63, Brahms became particularly interested in the music of Franz Schubert. The latter's influence may be identified in works by Brahms dating from the period, such as the two piano quartets Op.25 and Op.26, and the Piano Quintet which alludes to Schubert's String Quintet and Grand Duo for piano four hands. The influence of Chopin and Mendelssohn on Brahms is less obvious, although occasionally one can find in his works what seems to be an allusion to one of theirs (for example, Brahms's Scherzo, Op.4, alludes to Chopin's Scherzo in B-flat minor; the scherzo movement in Brahms's Piano Sonata in <b>F</b> <b>minor,</b> Op.5, alludes to the finale of Mendelssohn's Piano Trio in C minor).|$|E
25|$|Violin Sonata No. 3 in E minor, Op. 57 (1938). Recorded by David Oistrakh, among others. A vast work in four movements, a {{counterpart}} to his Night Wind Piano Sonata, No. 7. Introduzione– Andante meditamente, Scherzo– Allegro molto vivace, leggiero, Andante con moto, Finale– Allegro molto. A motto {{theme in the}} Introduction juxtaposes chords quietly but insistently, joined by a melody on the violin. The melody becomes the first theme of the– lengthy– sonata-form movement that follows, juxtaposed with other themes including a march in imitation. The folksy and syncopated Scherzo in A minor, thematically related to the opening movement’s faster sections, is in Rondo-form. After a reminiscence of the motto, the Andante is a lament in <b>F</b> <b>minor,</b> extremely Russian in sentiment. The virtuoso Finale has thematic elements related to Russian Orthodox liturgical music (Medtner was born Lutheran but late in life converted to Orthodox).|$|E
