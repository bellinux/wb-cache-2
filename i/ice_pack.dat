5|$|If {{no signs}} of an {{allergic}} reaction are present, an <b>ice</b> <b>pack</b> or commercially available sprays are used to relieve the pain. Stingose is also recommended to treat a jack jumper sting. Other treatments include washing the stung area with soap and water, and if continuous pain remains for several days, antihistamine tablets are taken for one to three days.|$|E
5|$|The Challenger {{expedition}} {{was followed}} by the 1879–1881 expedition of the Jeannette, led by United States Navy Lieutenant George Washington DeLong. The team sailed across the Chukchi Sea and recorded meteorological and astronomical data in addition to taking soundings of the seabed. The ship became trapped in the <b>ice</b> <b>pack</b> near Wrangel Island in September 1879, and was ultimately crushed and sunk in June 1881.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{lithosphere}} {{is divided}} into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans. The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and other sources of water {{that contribute to the}} hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic <b>ice</b> <b>pack.</b> Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many large}} rorquals, the fin whale is a {{cosmopolitan}} species. It {{is found in}} all the world's major oceans and in waters ranging from the polar to the tropical. It is absent only from waters close to the <b>ice</b> <b>pack</b> at both {{the north and south}} extremities and relatively small areas of water away from the large oceans, such as the Red Sea although they can reach into the Baltic Sea, a marginal sea of such conditions. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. It is less densely populated in the warmest, equatorial regions.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} {{treatment}} for a Myrmecia sting depends on {{the severity of the}} reaction. If no signs of an allergic reaction are seen, an <b>ice</b> <b>pack</b> or commercially available spray is used to relieve the pain. Washing the stung area, stingose, and the use of antihistamine tablets are other methods to reduce the pain. Indigenous Australians use bush remedies to treat Myrmecia stings, such as rubbing the tips of bracken ferns onto the stung area. Carpobrotus glaucescens is also used to treat stung areas, using juices that are squeezed and rubbed onto the area, which quickly relieves the pain from the sting.|$|E
5|$|Types B and C live {{close to}} the <b>ice</b> <b>pack,</b> and diatoms in these waters may be {{responsible}} for the yellowish coloring of both types. Mitochondrial DNA sequences support the theory that these are recently diverged separate species. More recently, complete mitochondrial sequencing indicates the two Antarctic groups that eat seals and fish should be recognized as distinct species, as should the North Pacific transients, leaving the others as subspecies pending additional data. Advanced methods that sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome revealed systematic differences in DNA between different populations.|$|E
40|$|Ice growth {{computation}} for the Duluth-Superior {{harbor and}} the adjacent Lake Superior waters, using the heat budget balance, agrees {{well with the}} measured ice values for the 1972 - 73 winter season. ERTS data {{is used for the}} determination of ice albedo and the resulting ice decay rate on Lake Superior. During the period of <b>ice</b> <b>packing</b> near Duluth, the calculated ice decay rates, combined with the ERTS data on the extent and the condition of the ice field indicate maximum <b>ice</b> <b>packing</b> between March 20 - 27, when the <b>packed</b> <b>ice</b> field, exhibiting albedo values above 70 % reached an average 60 cm thickness. The results offer a method for description of <b>ice</b> <b>packing</b> which could be used for ice forecasting on Lake Superior if more frequent ERTS images were available...|$|R

5|$|The fin whale's body is {{long and}} slender, {{coloured}} brownish-grey with a paler underside. The fin whale is a large baleen whale that belongs to the Cetacean order, which includes all species of whale, dolphin and porpoise. At least two recognized subspecies exist, in the North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere. It is found in all the major oceans, from polar to tropical waters. It is absent only from waters close to the <b>ice</b> <b>pack</b> at the poles and relatively small areas of water away from the open ocean. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. Its food consists of small schooling fish, squid, and crustaceans including copepods and krill.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, the {{shrinking}} Arctic sea ice {{has made the}} Northern Sea Route feasible for commercial cargo ships between Europe and East Asia during a six-to-eight-week window in the summer months, shortening the voyage by thousands of miles compared to that through the Suez Canal.

25|$|Groundwater {{makes up}} about {{twenty percent of}} the world's fresh water supply, which is about 0.61% of the entire world's water, {{including}} oceans and permanent ice. Global groundwater storage is roughly equal to the total amount of freshwater stored in the snow and <b>ice</b> <b>pack,</b> including the north and south poles.

25|$|If stung, {{the site}} will appear red and may remain itchy and swollen for many days. The best {{treatment}} of stings is to first wash the area with soap and water, then use an antiseptic, and if swelling remains apply an <b>ice</b> <b>pack.</b> Many people are allergic to wasp venom, {{and if this is}} the case, a sting can result in severe anaphylactic shock. Symptoms of this include swelling of airways, including mouth lips and tongue, troubled breathing, dizziness and tightness of chest. If an individual exhibits any of these symptoms after acquiring a sting from R. romandi seek medical attention immediately.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{remained}} on the ice for several more weeks, and when the <b>ice</b> <b>pack</b> broke up they used Endurances three lifeboats to reach Elephant Island.

Shackleton arrived at the whaling station on South Georgia Island two weeks later, but because the whaling ships were not equipped to penetrate Antarctic sea ice it took Shackleton three months before he successfully approached Elephant Island in August 1916 and rescued the rest of his crew on his third attempted rescue mission.|$|E
