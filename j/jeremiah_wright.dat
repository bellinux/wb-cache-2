25|$|One of {{the crucial}} {{questions}} after Obama's speech was what effect (if any) the speech would have on voters {{in terms of their}} overall opinion of Obama and their willingness to vote for him in the remaining Democratic primaries and in the general election.

25|$|In early 2008, as part {{of their}} presidential {{election}} coverage, news media outlets and political commentators brought Trinity to national attention when controversial excerpts of sermons by the church's longtime former pastor <b>Jeremiah</b> <b>Wright</b> were broadcast to highlight Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's relationship with Wright and the church. Obama responded with a speech, A More Perfect Union, which addressed the criticisms and largely alleviated them from popular political criticisms at the time.|$|E
25|$|Reaction to Obama's {{speech was}} swift and {{widespread}} in the United States. Politicians, news media, members of the political punditry, academics, and other groups and individuals quickly weighed in on its significance and effectiveness.

25|$|<b>Jeremiah</b> <b>Wright</b> {{is a man}} who {{less than}} a week after 9/11 gave a sermon that sadistically rejoiced how America's {{chickens}} had come home to roost... The fact is, Barack Obama opted to remain in this minister's company for more than six years after that sermon until partially distancing himself just last week in the heat of a presidential race... What the analysts who are gushing over Obama's sentiments regarding race relations are missing is not only did Obama fail to accomplish the mission he needed to, he didn't even really try. He made no attempt to explain his relationship with Wright and why he hung around a man who habitually offered such hateful rhetoric. Obama instead offered a non-sequitur on race relations.|$|E

500|$|In 1990 Barack Obama, at {{the time}} a student at Harvard Law School, {{attended}} a sermon at the Trinity United Church of Christ preached by <b>Jeremiah</b> <b>Wright.</b> Taking the Books of Samuel as a starting point, Wright explained that he had studied Watts's Hope in the 1950s, and had rediscovered the painting when Dr Frederick G. Sampson delivered a lecture on it in the late 1980s (Sampson described it as [...] "a study in contradictions"), before discussing the image's significance in the modern world.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the decline}} in Watts's popularity, Hope {{remained}} influential.

McCain barred using the <b>Jeremiah</b> <b>Wright</b> controversy in ads against Obama, but the campaign did frequently criticize Obama regarding his purported relationship with Bill Ayers. [...] McCain's rallies became increasingly vitriolic, with attendees denigrating Obama and displaying a growing anti-Muslim and anti-African-American sentiment. After one female McCain supporter said she did not trust Obama because [...] "he's an Arab", McCain pointedly replied to the woman, [...] "No ma'am. He's a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues." [...] McCain's response was considered one of the finer moments of the campaign and was still being viewed several years later as a marker for civility in American politics.

500|$|Obama's speech, on {{the theme}} of [...] "The Audacity of Hope", was {{extremely}} well received.

In light of Obama's well-known interest in Watts's painting, and amid concerns over a perceived dislike of the British, in the last days of Gordon Brown's government historian and Labour Party activist Tristram Hunt proposed that Hope be transferred to the White House. According to an unverified report in the Daily Mail, the offer was made but rejected by Obama, who wished to distance himself from <b>Jeremiah</b> <b>Wright</b> following controversial remarks made by Wright.|$|E
