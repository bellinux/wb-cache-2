60|$|These four parallelisms {{will appear}} the more {{significant}} {{the more we}} contemplate them. While the points specified, are points in which societies agree with individual organisms, they are also points in which individual organisms agree with one another, and disagree with all things else. In the course of its existence, every plant and animal increases in mass, in a way not paralleled by inorganic objects: even such inorganic objects as crystals, which arise by growth, show us no such definite relation between growth and existence as organisms do. The orderly progress from simplicity to complexity, displayed by bodies-politic in common with living bodies, is a characteristic which distinguishes living bodies from the inanimate bodies amid which they move. That <b>functional</b> <b>dependence</b> of parts, which is scarcely more manifest in animals than in nations, has no counterpart elsewhere. And in no aggregate except an organic or a social one, is there a perpetual removal and replacement of parts, joined with a continued integrity of the whole. Moreover, societies and organisms are not only alike in these peculiarities, {{in which they are}} unlike all other things; but the highest societies, like the highest organisms, exhibit them in the greatest degree. We see that the lowest animals do not increase to anything like the sizes of the higher ones; and, similarly, we see that aboriginal societies are comparatively limited in their growths. In complexity, our large civilized nations as much exceed primitive savage tribes, as a mammal does a zoophyte. Simple communities, like simple creatures, have so little mutual dependence of parts, that mutilation or subdivision causes but little inconvenience; but from complex communities, as from complex creatures, you cannot remove any considerable organ without producing great disturbance or death of the rest. And in societies of low type, as in inferior animals, the life of the aggregate, often cut short by division or dissolution, exceeds in length the lives of the component units, very far less than in civilized communities and superior animals; which outlive many generations of their component units.|$|E

40|$|Packed pebble {{beds are}} {{granular}} systems composed of small particles generally arranged in irregular lattices {{and surrounded by}} a gas filling their interstitial spaces. They show non-linear and coupled thermal and mechanical behaviours, which are under theoretical and experimental investigation to set-up a realistic constitutive model to be adopted for design-oriented purposes. At the Department of Nuclear Engineering (DIN) of the University of Palermo a realistic constitutive model of fusion-relevant pebble beds thermo-mechanical behaviour was developed adopting a "continuous" approach, {{based on the assumption}} that a pebble bed could be considered as a continuous, homogeneous and isotropic medium, characterized by effective thermal and mechanical properties strictly depending on its temperature, pressure and/or mechanical volumetric strain. Within this framework, an experimental campaign was launched at DIN to assess the <b>functional</b> <b>dependences</b> of lithium orthosilicate polydisperse pebble bed effective thermal diffusive properties on both temperature and pressure, by means of the purposely-outlined Improved Current Pulse method. The ATTAR- 1 test section was set-up and a test campaign was carried out on a 24 mm high reference polydisperse lithium orthosilicate pebble bed, at temperatures ranging from 20 °C up to 300 °C and pressures up to 30 bar. The <b>functional</b> <b>dependences</b> of the pebble bed thermal diffusive properties on both temperature and pressure were derived and they agree quite well with those shown in literature...|$|R
