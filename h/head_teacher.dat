5|$|Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru {{revolves}} around the main protagonist Mizuho Miyanokouji, a male high school student. After Mizuho's grandfather dies, his will is reviewed, which explains his desire to have his grandson transfer to Seio Girls' Academy, the same one his own mother attended and his ancestors founded. Abiding by the will, Mizuho cross-dresses to attend the school. The headmistress, the deputy <b>head</b> <b>teacher</b> (visual novel only), Mizuho's homeroom teacher Hisako Kajiura and Mariya Mikado initially know his secret; Shion Jujo and Ichiko Takashima also eventually find this out. Mizuho is very popular among the other students, who often talk about how pretty, nice, and athletic Mizuho is. This rampant popularity escalates to him even being nominated against his will to join in on the Elder election. By these terms, the current student council president, Takako Itsukushima, runs against Mizuho.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{reported}} interview study from Sweden is to contribute {{to our understanding of}} how <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> can promote inclusive practices. Five <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> were selected from a larger sample of <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> working in compulsory schools (6 – 16) according to specific criteria in order to obtain <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> who work effectively and express inclusive values relative to a relational perspective. The interviews were semi-structured, and a thematic analysis was performed. Head teachers’ strategies were in focus. The theoretical point of departure is critical pragmatism. Overall the five <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> reported similar strategies. The <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> describe the importance of educational leadership through observation and participation in activities in the classrooms. They advocate flexibility in the solutions provided for students in need of special support preferring solutions carried out in the regular classroom by the class/subject <b>teacher.</b> <b>Head</b> <b>teachers</b> see special educational needs coordinators (SENCOs) as important partners in their work towards more inclusive practices. <b>Head</b> <b>teachers</b> express the importance of consensus among their staff. They seem to welcome government’s increasing demands and steering concerning how <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> should manage their schools. Finally, it is discussed whether the <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> can be said to work ‘inclusively’ and, more generally, the methodological challenges researchers must confront in studies concerning ‘inclusive’ education...|$|R

5|$|Each of {{the seven}} books is set {{over the course of}} one school year. Harry struggles with the {{problems}} he encounters, and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules. If students are caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors. The stories reach their climax in the summer term, near or just after final exams, when events escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either Voldemort or one of his followers, the Death Eaters, with the stakes {{a matter of life and}} death – a point underlined, as the series progresses, by characters being killed in each of the final four books. In the aftermath, he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with <b>head</b> <b>teacher</b> and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The only exception to this school-centred setting is the final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in which Harry and his friends spend most of their time away from Hogwarts, and only return there to face Voldemort at the dénouement.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: School {{health program}} (SHP) is a {{critical}} aspect of the nation's healthcare system integrating education and delivery of health-care services. We sought to explore knowledge of <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> regarding the SHP and determine their level of implementation. Methods: A survey was conducted of <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> of privately owned primary and secondary schools in Ilorin. A pretested questionnaire with information on knowledge of SHP and current facilities and practices in their schools was given to <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> at a training workshop to improve their awareness regarding hygiene and disease prevention in schools. Results: A total of 100 questionnaires were distributed with 84 <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> returning their completed questionnaires. The mean (standard deviation) age of the <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> was 43. 3 (9. 9) years with a female:male ratio of 1. 9 : 1.

40|$|This study {{explored}} the current levels and challenges/barriers facing teacher participation in school decision-making in the Cape Coast Metropolitan area and Mfantseman Municipality in the Central Region of Ghana. The study employed the explanatory sequential mixed method design involving semi-structured interviews with 11 <b>teachers,</b> 4 <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> and 4 circuit supervisors. Furthermore, questionnaires {{were administered to}} 209 <b>teachers,</b> 26 <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> and 11 circuit supervisors. The SPSS version 20 and the Nvivo software version 10 were used to analyse the questionnaire survey and the semi-structured interview. In a micro ethnographic study, <b>teachers</b> and <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> from 2 schools that recorded the highest and lowest teacher participation in school decision-making were subsequently observed during staff and Parent Teacher Association (PTA) meetings. In addition, their documents such as staff and PTA minutes books were also analysed. Classroom, committee/group and school levels emerged as the levels of teacher participation in school decision-making. However, few teachers were found participating at the school level, while the majority participated at the classroom level, with some at the committee/group level. The study found that unilateral decisions by <b>head</b> <b>teachers,</b> unimplemented decisions and insufficient funds were the challenges/barriers to teacher participation in school decision-making. Nevertheless, almost all the <b>teachers,</b> <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> and circuit supervisors agreed {{that there should be}} regular training for <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> with regard to the tenets of school decision-making and leadership to enable them fully involve teachers in all issues concerning the school. The study concludes that for teachers to participate fully in all school decision-making and for schools to improve, <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> need to motivate teachers, consult them, trust and be transparent to them in all school related issues. Furthermore, the researcher recommends a nationwide training of <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> and decentralisation of power in schools. At the school level, teacher empowerment, creating instruction-oriented structures and teacher motivation are the key to effective teacher in PSDM...|$|R

40|$|Global {{developments}} have brought many changes to Saudi Arabia. One {{of these is}} that women are now being encouraged to become educated {{and participate in the}} workforce in order to contribute to the social and economic development of the country. In order to achieve this, it is necessary for girls to receive a good education. However, there is currently no adequate training programme in place for female <b>head</b> <b>teachers,</b> which means that girls’ education does not always reach a desirable standard. The main objective of this thesis is to determine the most important training needs of <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> in Aljouf province and Alqurayat governorate in Saudi Arabia and to make recommendations based on the findings regarding ways of enhancing head teachers’ training and hence providing a better education for schoolchildren. The research was conducted only in the aforementioned areas, which could be seen as a limitation of the study, but as Saudi education is highly centralised, {{it is likely that the}} findings can be generalised to the country as a whole. The research instruments used were a questionnaire survey completed by 470 <b>head</b> <b>teachers,</b> both male and female, and face-to-face interviews with 18 male <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> and 18 female <b>head</b> <b>teachers.</b> Analysis of the data thus acquired indicated that, according to the perceptions of the participants, the greatest need for training was in the following areas: information technology and communication; administrative requirements; staff development; and student affairs, in descending order of importance. The main recommendations made based on the findings are that adequate training courses be established for both males and females, particularly in the area of information technology; the number of training courses should be increased and such courses should be held in the towns of residence of female head teachers; unqualified <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> should be replaced by those holding an educational qualification; those wishing to work as <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> should have at least five years’ teaching experience; and there should be greater incentives for female <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> to attend training courses. It is suggested that future research be conducted with the aim of discovering training needs of <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> as perceived by teachers and educational supervisors and by directors of Education Departments. It is also suggested that studies be conducted to determine the training needs of female <b>head</b> <b>teachers</b> in other provinces in Saudi Arabia. ...|$|R
