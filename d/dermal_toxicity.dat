Using laboratory test animals as surrogates for humans and dosages much higher than are expected from exposure related to actual use, rats showed low short-term oral, <b>dermal,</b> and inhalation <b>toxicity</b> to clothianidin. For mice, acute oral toxicity was moderate to high. Rabbits showed little to no skin or eye irritation when exposed to clothianidin, and the skin of guinea pigs was not sensitized by it.

In an initial LADTAG workshop that was held in 2005, experts noted that {{they were unable to}} reconcile individual expert opinions to set an inhalation standard. The array of opinions from these experts spanned a 300-fold range (i.e., 0.01 to 3 mg/m3). The members of the LADTAG concluded that research is necessary to narrow this wide uncertainty range, the lower end of which cannot be met by known methods of environmental control, and that there is an urgency to determine the standard so that environmental systems for the lunar vehicle can be appropriately designed. Therefore, in keeping with the LADTAG experts' recommendations, members of the LDTRP have reviewed first-hand accounts of Apollo astronauts who were exposed to lunar dust during their missions as well as of terrestrial-based human exposures to dust generated in the mining industry and to volcanic ash. In accordance with the LADTAG recommendations to increase our evidence base, the LDTRP is conducting studies of Apollo spacesuits, filters, vacuum bags, and rock-collection boxes. These studies will enable us to focus our understanding of the grain-size distribution that is present in the lunar surface samples and in the habitat, but the dust surfaces are expected to be fully passivated.|$|E

Crassocephalum bauchiense, a medicinal herb found in the West Region of Cameroon is used to treat gastrointestinal infections as well as liver disorders. The ethyl acetate extract from the leaves of C. bauchiense was evaluated for its antibacterial activity as well as acute and sub-acute toxicities. Methods The plant extract was prepared by maceration in ethyl acetate. Its phytochemical screening was done by standard methods. The broth microdilution method was used to evaluate the in vitro antibacterial activity. The in vivo antibacterial activity of a gel formulation (0. 05, 1 and 2 % w/v) of this extract was evaluated using a Staphylococcus aureus -induced dermatitis in a murine model. Selected haematological and biochemical parameters were used to evaluate the <b>dermal</b> sub-acute <b>toxicity</b> of the extract in rats. Results Phytochemical screening of the C. bauchiense extract revealed the presence of alkaloids, phenols, tannins and sterols. In vitro antibacterial activities were observed against all the tested microorganisms (MIC = 0. 04 - 6. 25 mg/ml). Formulated extract-gel (2 % w/v) and gentamycin (reference drug) eradicated the microbial infection after five days of treatment.

In order to evaluate the average levels of contamination of the cut flowers and to assess the risk for professionals exposed to pesticide residues when handling cut flowers, a survey was carried out with a group of florists from the Belgian largest cities. Fifty samples of roses (5 stems per bouquet) were collected: 45 bouquets were sampled in the 7 largest cities of Belgium (Antwerp, Brussels, Charleroi, Ghent, Leuven, Liege and Namur) and 5 were sampled from 5 supermarkets. Analysis of residual pesticide deposit is made by combining two multi-residue methods (GC-MS-MS and LC-MS-MS) in a laboratory accredited for pesticide residues. For all the samples analysed, a total of 97 active substances were detected, i. e. an average of 14 active substances per bouquet and a total average pesticide load of 26, 03 mg/kg per flower sample. Most active substances (a. s.) reached high levels of residues, with concentrations between 10 and 50 mg/kg.

There is a need for assessing the health and environmental impacts, the nanoparticles life cycle, the human exposure routes, the behavior of nanoparticles in the body, and the risk for workers. Possible routes of entry into the body include inhalation, absorption through the skin or digestive tract, injection, and absorption or implantation for drugs delivery systems. In particular, dermal absorption and skin penetration of nanoparticles needs a better evaluation because few and contradictory data are present in the literature, mainly on titanium dioxide.

40|$|AbstractAcute oral, <b>dermal</b> and {{inhalation}} <b>toxicity</b> classifications {{of chemicals}} under the United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) should typically {{be based on}} data from rats and rabbits, with the tacit assumption that such characterizations are valid for human risk. However this assumption is not appropriate in all cases. A case in point is the acute toxicity classification of ethylene glycol mono-n-butyl ether (EGBE, 2 -butoxyethanol, CAS 111 - 76 - 2), where acute toxicity data from rats or rabbits leads to an overly conservative assessment of toxicity. Hemolysis is the primary response elicited in sensitive species following EGBE administration and the proximate toxicant in this response is 2 -butoxyacetic acid (BAA), the major metabolite of EGBE. The sensitivity of erythrocytes to this effect varies between species; rats and rabbits are sensitive to BAA-mediated hemolysis, whereas humans and guinea pigs are not. In this publication, a weight of evidence approach for the acute hazard classification of EGBE under GHS is presented. The approach uses acute toxicity data from guinea pigs with supporting mechanistic and pharmacokinetic data in conjunction with human experience and shows that adopting the standard method results in over-classification...|$|R

40|$|Antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones (FQLs) are {{commonly}} used to treat ocular infections but are also known to cause <b>dermal</b> melanocyte <b>toxicity.</b> The release of dispersed pigments from the iris into the aqueous humor has been considered a possible ocular side effect of the systemic administration of FQLs such as Moxifloxacin, and this condition is known as bilateral acute iris transillumination (BAIT). Bilateral acute depigmentation of iris (BADI) is a similar condition, with iris pigment released into the aqueous, {{but it has not}} been reported as a side effect of FQL. Iris pigments are synthesized by the melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase (TYR) and can be detected but not quantified by using slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The correlation between dispersed pigments in the aqueous and the extent of melanocyte toxicity due to topical antibiotics in vivo is not well studied. Here, we aimed to study the effect of topical FQLs on iris tissue, the pigment release in the aqueous humor and the development of clinically evident iris atrophic changes. We evaluated this process by measuring the activity of TYR in the aqueous humor of 82 healthy eyes undergoing cataract surgery following topical application of FQLs such as Moxifloxacin (27 eyes, preservative-free) or Ciprofloxacin (29 eyes, with preservative) or the application of non-FQL Tobramycin (26 eyes, with preservative) as a control. In addition, the patients were questioned and examined for ocular side effects in pre- and post-operative periods. Our data showed a significantly higher mean TYR activity in the aqueous humor of Ciprofloxacin-treated eyes compared to Moxifloxacin- (preservative free, p < 0. 0001) or Tobramycin-treated eyes (p < 0. 0001), which indicated that few quinolones under certain conditions are toxic to the iris melanocytes. However, the reduced TYR activity in the aqueous of Moxifloxacin-treated eyes was possibly due to the presence of a higher drug concentration, which inhibits TYR activity. Consistently, immunoblotting analysis of the aqueous humor from both Ciprofloxacin- and Moxifloxacin-treated eyes showed the presence of soluble TYR enzyme, thus reflecting its toxicity to iris melanocytes and corresponding to its activity in the aqueous humor. Intriguingly, none of these patients developed any clinically appreciable ocular side effects characteristic of BAIT or BADI. Overall, our results suggest that topical antibiotics cause different levels of iris melanocyte toxicity, releasing dispersed pigments into the aqueous humor, which can be measured through TYR enzyme activity. Hence, we conclude that topical FQLs may cause subclinical toxicity to the iris melanocytes but may not be the sole cause of the development of BAIT or BADI. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Bacteriol. 84 : 882 – 887. 1962. —Studies were performed with various preparations of endotoxin from Escherichia coli to test for a possible relation between {{the physical}} state or degree of aggregation of the toxin and <b>dermal</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Endotoxic fractions were prepared by enzymatic and physical dissolution of cell walls, phenol extraction, and ether extraction. A comparison of the toxic effects of the different preparations after a single intradermal injection into rabbits demonstrated that the degree and duration of the inflammatory response was influenced significantly by the physical state of the preparation. In addition, the least active material, the aqueous ether extract, was treated so as to yield three preparations differing only {{in the degree of}} aggregation. Dermal titration of these preparations suggests that a departure from an optimal range of particle size results in a diminished capacity of endotoxin to induce the acute and protracted manifestations of dermal response...|$|E
40|$|The general {{aim of this}} PhD {{project was}} to {{investigate}} the integrated use of physicochemical and in vitro data for predicting the toxicological hazard of chemicals in animals. This was achieved in two stages: firstly, by developing two types of model for acute <b>dermal</b> and ocular <b>toxicity</b> - structure-activity relationships (SARs) based on easily calculated physicochemical properties, and prediction models (PMs) based on experimentally derived physicochemical or in vitro data; and secondly, by evaluating the tiered testing approach to hazard classification, in which different classification models (CMs) are applied sequentially before animal testing is conducted. The thesis therefore reports the development and assessment of CMs for skin irritation, skin corrosion and eye irritation, as well as the outcome of simulations in which these models were incorporated into tiered testing strategies for these toxicological endpoints. The results show that the tiered testing approach to hazard classification provides a reliable means of reducing and refining the use of animals, without compromising the ability to classify chemicals. In addition to developing the above-mentioned CMs, regression models for corneal permeability were developed, and the relationship between corneal permeability and eye irritation was investigated. The thesis also describes the development and assessment of a novel statistical method called embedded cluster modelling (ECM), which generates elliptic models of biological activity from embedded data sets. The combined use of this method with the existing method of cluster significance analysis (CSA) is illustrated through the development of SARs for eye irritation potential. Finally, novel applications of the bootstrap resampling method were investigated. In particular, algorithms based on this method are shown to provide a means of assessing: a) the minimal variability associated with the Draize rabbit tests for skin and eye irritation; and b) the variability in Cooper statistics (commonly used to summarise the performance of two-group CMs) that arises from chemical variation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Histological aspects were {{considered}} {{in order to}} evaluate the in vivo photoprotective effect of a w/o microemulsion containing quercetin against UVB irradiation-induced <b>dermal</b> damages. The <b>toxicity</b> in cell culture and the potential skin irritation resulting from topical application of this formulation were investigated. Methods. Mouse dorsal surfaces were treated topically with 300 mg of the unloaded and quercetin-loaded (0. 3 %, w/w) microemulsions before and after exposure to UVB (2. 87 J/cm(2)) irradiation. The untreated control groups irradiated and non-irradiated were also evaluated. UVB-induced histopathological changes {{as well as the}} photoprotective effect of this formulation were evaluated considering the parameters of infiltration of inflammatory cells, epidermis thickening (basale and spinosum layers) and collagen and elastic fiber contents. The cytotoxicity of the reported formulation was evaluated in L 929 mice fibroblasts by MTT assay and the skin irritation was investigated after topical application of both unloaded and quercetin-loaded microemulsions once a day for 15 days. Results. The results demonstrated that the w/o microemulsion containing quercetin reduced the incidence of histological skin alterations, mainly the connective-tissue damage, induced by exposure to UVB irradiation. This suggests that protective effects of this formulation against UV-induced responses are not secondary to the interference of UV transmission (i. e., blocking the UVB radiation from being absorbed by the skin), as is usually implied with UVB absorbers and sunscreens, but is instead due to different biological effects of this flavonoid. Furthermore, by evaluating the cytotoxic effect on L 929 cells and histological aspects such as infiltration of inflammatory cells and epidermis thickness of hairless mice, the present study also demonstrated the lack of toxicity of the proposed system. Conclusion. Based on these mice models, a detailed characterization of the w/o microemulsion incorporating quercetin effects as a photochemoprotective agent on human skin is presented.

40|$|Introduction The {{environmental}} impact quotient (EIQ) developed by Kovach et al (1992) is used {{an effort to}} fill an important gap; i. e. {{the need to provide}} farmers and others with easy-to-use information about the adverse effects of pesticides. It represents a method for calculating the {{environmental impact}}s of pesticides, and the values obtained from these calculations can be used to compare different pesticides and pest management programs with each other to ultimately determine which program or pesticide is likely to have the lowest environmental impact. The EIQ value for a particular active ingredient is calculated according to a formula that includes parameters for <b>toxicity</b> (<b>dermal,</b> chronic, bird, bee, fish, and beneficial arthropod), soil half-life, systemicity, leaching potential, and plant surface half-life. Each of these parameters is given a rating of 1, 3 or 5 to reflect its potential of causing harm. Six of these ratings are based on measured or known properties and the other five are based on judgments according to their potentially low, moderate or severe impact. Since the EIQ value is mainly a hazard indicator, additional calculations are required to obtain an indication of the pesticide risk. To account for exposure, an equation called the Field Use EIQ has been developed. This rating is calculated by multiplying the EIQ value for a specific chemical from the tables by the percent active ingredient in the formulation and its dosage rate used per hectare (usually in liters or kilograms of the formulated product). EIQ is used in different studies to compare the environmental effects of different pesticides and/or different production systems (Avila et al., 2011; Doris et al., 2011; Gallivan et al., 2001; Macharia et al., 2009). The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate management strategies in using pesticides in wheat and barley farms in the city of Mashhad located in the Khorasan Razavi province in Iran. Materials and Methods Data related to pesticides (insecticides, herbicides and fungicides) used in wheat and barley in the city of Mashhad located in the Khorasan Razavi province were gathered through face to face filling questionnaires by the users. The indices measured in this study include Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) and its components (farm worker, consumer, leaching and ecology) and Field Use Rate - EIQ (FUR-EIQ). EIQ is calculated based on the work of Kovach et al. (1992). The formula is: EIQ=C[(DT× 5) +(DT×P) ]+[(C×((S+P) / 2) ×SY) +(L) ]+[(F×R) +(D×((S+P) / 2) × 3) +(Z×P× 3) +(B×P× 5) ]/ 3 In this formula: DT: Dermal Toxicity; C: long term health effects; SY: mode of action; F: fish toxicity; L: leaching potential; R: surface runoff potential; D: bird toxicity; S: soil residue half-life; Z: bee toxicity; B: beneficial arthropod toxicity; P: plant surface half-life. EIQ field use rating was calculated by multiplying the EIQ value for a specific chemical from the table by the percent active ingredient in the formulation and the rate of its dosage used per hectare: EIQ Field Use Rating = EIQ ×...|$|R
