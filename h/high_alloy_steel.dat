From {{information}} on M, for lath and lenticular martensite {{the driving force}} {{for the start of}} a formation of the two types of martensite was calculated in a number of Fe-X systems.

From the kinetics of isothermal a martensite in ferrous alloys one can clearly distinguish between two groups of <b>alloys,</b> <b>high</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steels</b> and carbon containing <b>steels.</b> <b>High</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steels</b> with low M, temperature have a temperature dependence corresponding to a very low activation energy, possibly 7 kJ/mol. -It can hardly depend on any diffusion process.

50|$|Noble metals may be easy {{to solder}} but they have brittle joints. The metals in the good {{category}} require {{a large amount of}} heat therefore oxidation is an issue. To overcome this a flux is required. For carbon steel, low alloy steel, zinc, and nickel the presence of sulfur creates a brittle joint; lower temperatures are used to minimize this problem. The oxides on the surface of aluminium cause wetting issues and special solders must be used to prevent galvanic corrosion issues. Stainless steel and <b>high</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> have a low solderability because the chromium alloying element creates oxides that require aggressive fluxes. The only way that the final category of metals can be soldered is by pre-plating them in a metal that is solderable.|$|E

40|$|It is {{commonly}} believed that <b>high</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> castings have inferior corrosion resistance to their wrought counterparts {{as a result}} of the increased amount of microsegregation remaining in the as-cast structure.

Detailed electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and light optical microscopy (LOM) were utilized to correlate the amount of homogenization and dissolution present after various thermal treatments with calculated values and with the resultant corrosion resistance of the alloys. The influence of heat treatment time and temperature on the homogenization and dissolution kinetics were investigated using stainless steel alloys CN 3 MN and CK 3 MCuN.

40|$|Purpose: The {{study on}} structure-property {{relations}} of heavily cold worked and aged martensite in two high-alloy structural steels was presented. The {{aim was to}} understand properties of the sheet products better and thus extend applications of the newly developed cobalt-free maraging and precipitation hardening stainless steels. Design/methodology/approach: Mechanical tests were performed on cold rolled and aged specimens. Microstructures were analyzed using TEM and SEM. The crystallographic texture was analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction and ADC method. Findings: In the process of cold working and ageing both <b>high</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steels</b> studied could develop yield strength in excess of 1600 MPa. The main strengthening mechanism was precipitation hardening, while work hardening contribution to the strength was very limited. Overaging commences after prolonged treatment above 500 ºC, and in both steels {{could be related to}} reverted austenite. The texture developed by cold working was the one known as rolling texture type. Research limitations/implications: In this study the advantage is taken of the high strength that is developed by cold working followed by ageing. Further research is needed for the sheet or strip produced by cold working and annealed before fabrication. Practical implications: The properties of the <b>high</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steels</b> studied make them suitable for advanced sheet applications, e. g. as an airborne structural equipment. After welding, strength of the precipitation hardening steels could be largely restored by ageing, because their strength does not rely on strain hardening. Originality/value: Analysis of the cold worked properties, microstructure and texture, allowed for better understanding of the microstructure-property relationships in the low strain hardening <b>high</b> <b>alloy</b> sheet <b>steels.</b> The results obtained are of practical value for the development, production and manufacture of the ultra-high strength sheet steels...|$|R
