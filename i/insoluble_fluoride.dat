5|$|Americium readily {{reacts with}} oxygen and dissolves well in acids. The most common {{oxidation}} state for americium is +3, in which americium compounds are rather stable against oxidation and reduction. In this sense, americium is chemically similar to most lanthanides. The trivalent americium forms <b>insoluble</b> <b>fluoride,</b> oxalate, iodate, hydroxide, phosphate and other salts. Other oxidation {{states have been}} observed between +2 and +7, which is the widest range among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am3+ (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am4+ (yellow-reddish), AmV; (yellow), AmVI (brown) and AmVII (dark green). All oxidation states have their characteristic optical absorption spectra, with a few sharp peaks in the visible and mid-infrared regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding oxidation states. For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992nm.|$|E
40|$|There is no {{consensus}} about the clinical recommendation {{of the time that}} Duraphat&# 174; varnish should be maintained on enamel surfaces without suffering mechanical disturbance by the patient. Considering the importance of calcium fluoride (CaF 2) -like reservoirs on the anticaries effect of professional fluoride application, an in vitro study was designed to test the reactivity of Duraphat&# 174; varnish with enamel forming these reservoirs as a function of time. Since most fluoride in Duraphat&# 174; varnish is insoluble to react and form products on enamel, the relative contribution of the varnish soluble and <b>insoluble</b> <b>fluoride</b> fractions to the reactivity was also evaluated. For this, whole-varnish, containing soluble and <b>insoluble</b> <b>fluoride</b> (total fluoride concentration of 23699 &# 177; 384 &# 181;g F/g), or centrifuged varnish, containing only soluble fluoride (fluoride concentration of 258 &# 177; 97 &# 181;g F/g), were applied in a standardized manner on enamel slabs (n= 8 /varnish group/time), which were immersed in continuously renewed artificial saliva for up to 36 h. CaF 2 -like reservoirs formed on enamel by varnish application were extracted using 1 M KOH and fluoride concentration was measured with ion specific electrode. The results were expressed as &# 181;g F/cm 2 of enamel area. Whole varnish formed significantly higher fluoride concentration on enamel than centrifuged varnish, reaching maximum concentration at 24 h (22. 0 &# 177; 4. 5 &# 181;g F/cm 2). Centrifuged varnish reached maximum concentration at 6 h (3. 20 &# 177; 0. 81 &# 181;g F/cm 2). In conclusion, a longer varnish retention time than the usually recommended could improve the anticaries effect of Duraphat&# 174; varnish, allowing that NaF particles, initially insoluble in the varnish matrix, prolong the reactivity with enamel...|$|E
40|$|Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is the {{inorganic}} acid of elemental fluorine and causes tissue damage in humans by two mechanisms; free hydrogen ions cause a caustic burn and fluoride ions penetrate tissues resulting in chemical burns. The {{mode of action}} this acid assumes is to bind to calcium and magnesium when it comes into contact with skin and tissues. Once HF is absorbed through the skin or eyes, it dissociates and can cause extensive damage to tissues by the formation of <b>insoluble</b> <b>fluoride</b> salts. If enough Ca and Mg are absorbed, {{there may be an}} inadequate supply available for vital body functions. Exposures to hydrofluoric acid must be treated immediately, as sudden death has been reported from acid burns to as little as 2. 5 % of body surface area. Two treatments available today include calcium gluconate and Hexafluorine. Calcium gluconate works by combining with free fluoride ions to form insoluble calcium fluoride, ii thus preventing the burns that result from the extraction of calcium from tissue and bones. Depending on the surrounding circumstances, calcium gluconate can also be administered by injection or intra-arterial infusion. Hexafluorine has both absorption and chelating capacities enabling it to trap H+ and F...|$|E

40|$|The minimum {{requirement}} for the anti-caries effect of a dentifrice {{is the presence of}} available and stable fluoride in the formulation. The concentration of available fluoride in the major dentifrices sold in Brazil has been reported, but few data have been published about its stability, which is temperature-dependent. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the concentration and stability of fluoride in dentifrices sold in Manaus, AM, Brazil, which is a typical tropical city. The concentrations of total fluoride, total soluble fluoride, MFP, and of <b>insoluble</b> <b>fluoride</b> of six Brazilian dentifrices and an imported one were analyzed. The analyses were made when the dentifrices were purchased and during a year of storage at room temperature (28. 9 ± 1. 16 °C) and under refrigeration (26. 3 ± 0. 88 °C). The analyses were performed using an ion specific electrode Orion 96 - 09. At the time of purchase, all the dentifrices analyzed showed more than 1, 000 ppm (mug F-/g; w/w) of soluble fluoride. However, in most of them, this form of fluoride was not shown to be stable. The highest loss of soluble fluoride was found for storage at room temperature, reaching up to 40 %. Although all dentifrices comply with the Brazilian guidelines with regard to the concentration of total fluoride (maximum of 0. 15 %), the instability of soluble fluoride observed in some of them can impair their anti-caries effect and this condition is not contemplated in the Governmental rules...|$|E
40|$|Pozzolanic {{reactions}} play a {{key role}} in improving the compressive strengths of compacted fly ash-lime specimens. Based on studies performed with cement amended fly ash (FA), activation of fly ash-lime pozzolanic reactions should accelerate the rate of strength development and mobilize larger compressive strengths facilitating improved engineering performance of fly ash amended materials. Further, use of phosphogypsum (PG) is a cause of environmental concern as the material is acidic (pH < 3. 0) and contains considerable amounts of fluoride (0. 86 %). The main research objectives of the thesis are to activate lime-fly ash reactions by thermal and chemical activation process and examine the efficacy of fly ash pozzolanic reactions in controlling fluoride release by phosphogypsum. A comprehensive laboratory experimental program was performed to examine the influence of curing temperature (thermal activation) and calcined PG addition (chemical activation) on lime-fly ash reactions. The kinetics of fly ash-lime reactions are examined by monitoring the reacted lime content as function of curing period and temperature. The influence of variations in fly ash/lime content and dry density on the compressive strength developed by specimens is evaluated. The thermodynamic parameters for the fly ash-lime (FA-L) reactions have been delineated. Fly ash-lime-phosphogypsum (FA-L-G) mixes in slurry and compacted states were monitored for fluoride released as function of curing period The influence of curing temperature in activating fly ash-lime reactions is first examined. Specimens were cured at 25 °C (termed RTC or room temperature cured) and at 80 ° (termed SC or steam cured) to understand thermal activation of fly ash-lime reactions. The rate of lime consumption by SC specimens classified as 2 stage process. The robust increase during stage 2 of steam curing suggested that the lime-solidification reactions did not reach equilibrium even after 4 days of curing at the elevated temperature. While only 3. 1 to 3. 3 % of added lime was consumed after 28 days of curing at room temperature, much larger amounts of lime (8. 6 - 9. 3 %) were consumed after 4 days of steam-curing. Further, the lime-fly ash reactions were accelerated by 6 to 7 folds on curing the specimens at elevated temperature. The results indicated that activation of lime-fly ash reactions by curing at elevated temperature besides accelerating the rate of strength development also facilitated development of larger strength. Analysis of the free energy change values (ΔG°) indicated that the lime solidification reaction alters from dis-favored (less spontaneous) to favoured (spontaneous) state on curing at 80 oC. The positive ΔH° (enthalpy change) values for the fly ash-lime reactions indicated that the reactions are endothermic in nature and are facilitated by increase in curing temperature. Gypsum activation was achieved by addition of 2. 5 to 5 % calcined phosphogypsum to fly ash lime mixes and curing the compacted specimens at room temperature (FA-L-G specimens). The rate of lime consumption by FA-L-G specimens appeared to be three stage process. The mass of lime consumed by FA-L-G specimens was about 1. 5 to 3 folds higher than values of the RTC and SC specimens. Additional lime is consumed by FA-L-G specimens in ettringite formation. A similarity existed between rate of lime consumed and rate of strength developed by the FA-L-G specimens. It is proposed that besides lime solidification reactions, densification of the matrix by filling up of voids by fine gypsum particles and compaction of matrix by the growth of ettringite crystals also contribute to compressive strength of FA-L-G specimens; this additional mechanism of strength development accounts for their higher compressive strength in comparison to the SC and RTC specimens despite similar initial lime addition values. The trend of results suggests that activation of FA-L reactions by calcined PG addition is more effective than steam curing. Comparison of ΔG° values of RTC, SC and FA-L-G specimens revealed that the spontaneity of the lime solidification reactions is least for RTC specimens and improves with addition of phosphogypsum and further improves on curing at elevated temperature. Fly ash-lime pozzolanic reactions substantially reduced the fluoride released from the FA-L-G specimens. The marked reduction in fluoride released by PG amended with fly ash and lime is ascribed to entrapment of PG particles in the cemented matrix formed by fly ash-lime pozzolanic reactions together with consumption of fluoride in formation of <b>insoluble</b> <b>fluoride</b> bearing compounds. 	The thesis brings out that activation of fly ash-lime reactions leading to quicker and larger compressive strength development is achieved by curing the compacted fly ash-lime specimens at 80 °C for 24 hr or by addition of 2. 5 to 5 % of calcined PG to fly ash-lime mix and curing the compacted specimens at room-temperature. As larger strengths are developed by PG addition than by curing at 80 oC, it is recommended that FA-L-G technique be adopted for manufacture of building materials in the civil engineering industry. This technique is also sustainable as it does not require energy for heating which is needed in the steam-curing technique...|$|E

40|$|In this study, an {{extraction}} {{method and}} environmental {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) are employed to reveal {{the changes in the}} occurrence mode of fluorine in a coal-fired power plant in Inner Mongolia, China. The different occurrence states of fluorine during coal combustion and emission show that fluorine in coal mainly assumes insoluble inorganic mineral forms. The results illustrate that the three typical occurrence modes in coal are CaF 2, MgF 2 and AlF 3. The fluorine in fly ash can be captured by an electrostatic precipitator (EPS) or a bag filter. In contrast, the gaseous fluorine content in flue gas is only in the range of several parts per million; thus, it cannot be used in this study. The occurrence mode of fluorine in bottom ash and slag is inorganic villiaumite (e. g., soluble NaF, KF and insoluble CaF 2) which is difficult to break down even at high temperatures. The occurrence mode of fluorine with the highest content in fly ash is physically adsorbed fluorine along the direction of the flue gas flow. The <b>insoluble</b> inorganic mineral <b>fluoride</b> content in fly ash is also high, but the gradually increasing fluorine content in fly ash is mainly caused by physical adsorption.
