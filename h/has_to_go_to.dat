5|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the artifact, Shepard has {{a vision of the}} Reaper fleet approaching. Kenson and her entire team, however, turn out to have been indoctrinated from having spent too much time studying the artifact. She attacks Shepard, who is eventually overwhelmed by her soldiers. Upon awakening two days later, Shepard manages to escape and reach the control room, where he/she sets the asteroid on course to hit the Bahak system's relay. In retaliation, Kenson plans to destroy the asteroid by overloading the reactor core of the facility, but Shepard ultimately stops her. Shepard then contacts his/her starship and escapes shortly before the asteroid hits the Relay, resulting in the destruction of the entire Bahak system. Shepard is later met by Admiral Steven Hackett, their superior officer, who explains that he/she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Earth and face the consequences, setting the stage for Mass Effect 3.|$|E

At the show, Chief Wiggum and the Springfield Police Department suddenly appear to arrest Bart for making graffiti throughout the town. It is revealed that the gallery show is a sham and that Fairey is an undercover officer who helped the police identify Bart as the graffiti artist that had been spray-painting Springfield. Since Bart is just a boy, he is not sent to jail. Instead, he is punished by once again being locked up in the rabbit cage. When Bart tells Wiggum that he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the bathroom, Wiggum covers the cage with the blanket and finds Bart gone when he removes the blanket from the cage.|$|E
500|$|Ron {{became more}} heavily {{involved}} in Parks and Recreation storylines during the second season, and Offerman largely credited Schur {{with the development of}} the character. Schur has described Offerman as a [...] "once-in-a-generation comedic performer," [...] and [...] "our cast MVP, and in many ways our cast leader." [...] He compared Ron to a [...] "19th-century rugged individualist," [...] and said of creating the character, [...] "A lot of the credit <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Nick Offerman. In real life, he's an incredibly interesting guy, and at the very least, it's much easier to play an interesting guy when you're an interesting guy." [...] Offerman said his own sense of humor fuels much of the character, along with those of Schur, Greg Daniels, and the writing staff; he added: [...] "I never dreamed that I could prosper with my perverse sense of humor on a network show." [...] Schur said the staff liked writing for Ron because [...] "he's a great mix of a superhero, and also a deeply flawed, and very human and vulnerable person." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} segment, Springfield {{is held in}} a grip of terror by Bart, who has omnipotent powers. Bart turns whoever is not happy with his rule into another being, and even history is changed to suit Bart's pleasure. When Homer refuses to turn off a {{football}} game so that Bart can watch [...] "The Krusty the Clown Show" [...] (which has been running for 346 consecutive hours), Bart transports him into the football stadium {{in place of the}} ball for a field goal kick. As Homer creeps back into the house, trying to surprise Bart with a blow {{to the back of the}} head, Bart transforms him into a jack-in-the-box. Marge suggests that the two see Dr. Marvin Monroe. The doctor says that Bart is desperate for paternal attention from Homer and suggests that the two spend more time together. Despite being a jack-in-the-box, Homer spends quality time with Bart, and they soon become a normal, loving family. Bart turns Homer back into a human and the two share a warm family moment, causing Bart to wake up screaming. Bart and Lisa wake Homer and Marge and beg them to let them sleep in their bed. As the two crawl into bed, Homer laments that he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> work in a few hours and dozes off, becoming the last one in the episode to have a nightmare.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} largely {{based upon the}} 1985 film Spies Like Us, which starred Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd, and the movie is {{mentioned}} in the episode itself. The episode was also based on the 1977 spy film Telefon about brainwashed Russian spies in the U.S. who can be activated by a special code phrase. When Peter <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the bathroom, he runs to Cleveland's empty home, which has been put up for sale since he left to live in Virginia with his new family.

[...] Chase then replies that he was not in that movie; Peter also notes that he is honored to meet [...] "two of the Three Amigos," [...] a movie starring Chase but not Aykroyd.

When Aykroyd and Chase ask Stewie and Brian {{if they want to be}} [...] "spies like us", Stewie asks if they can be [...] "spies like them" [...] and points to Black Spy and White Spy from Spy vs. Spy, one of the head comic strip features of MAD magazine. When Aykroyd and Chase explain to Stewie and Brian how they were recruited as official spies by Reagan, a cutaway is shown of an event in which 1985 is awarded the [...] "Awesomest Year of the 80's" [...] prize and all characters spontaneously start dancing to the 1983 song [...] "(Keep Feeling) Fascination." [...] Later, Brian and Stewie agree to become agents, and Stewie asks if [...] "Ron Howard's weird-looking brother is here." [...] There is a cutaway to The Brady Bunch, in which it is revealed Mike Brady killed his first wife, and housekeeper Alice walks in and demands a raise.|$|E
500|$|Homer and Marge are {{scheduled}} to do a singing toast at their cousin Valerie's wedding, causing Marge to become nervous, due to her fear of embarrassment. Homer tells her not to worry, saying that he will {{make sure they do}} not mess up. Homer gets a fortune cookie stating that today will be his lucky day, but he does not believe so. However, he starts to believe this occurs when he crashes into a vending machine causing all of the snacks to fall out on him, and finds an Emerson, Lake & Palmer CD in the parking lot. He sings along to [...] "Lucky Man", driving recklessly to the synthesizer solo. He then goes to the Kwik-E-Mart for a lottery ticket, even though he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the wedding and sing with Marge. After a long wait, Homer gets his lottery ticket, only to find out the wedding has ended. When he takes his eyes off the road for a second, he crashes off the ramp. Homer wakes up in the hospital after the crash, and realizes he won a million dollars in the lottery. Homer does not want Marge to know he missed the wedding to get a lottery ticket, and has Barney pose as the winner. So that Marge does not know he won the money, he secretly leaves gifts for his family members. However, when Homer tries to get money out of the tree where he hid the money, Bart discovers that he won the lottery. Threatening to tell Marge, Bart demands that Homer publicly embarrasses himself, does unethical tasks, and becomes a victim of his own son. Eventually, Homer decides to tell Marge himself and get it over with. Taking Marge on a hot-air balloon, he reveals he won the lottery, causing Marge to become very glad and not furious about his absence at the wedding; he tells her he spent it all, leaving them poor as usual. However, Marge does not care, saying at least they have each other. Homer then reveals he spent the last of the money on a giant cherry blossom grove in the shape of Marge's face with the words [...] "Love of my Life". They then sing the song they were supposed to sing at the wedding together, off in the sunset.|$|E
