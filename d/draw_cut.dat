5000|$|Some fencers {{argue that}} <b>draw</b> <b>cuts</b> are not martially sound {{techniques}} and make cutting a due tempi ("double time") action, whereas a percussive cutting {{action would be}} in stesso tempo ("single time"). A counter-argument to {{this is that the}} slender, light blade of the rapier is a poor [...] "chopping" [...] blade and in period was often not particularly sharp. A <b>drawing</b> <b>cut</b> was far more effective for inflicting a serious wound. With the addition of the Cut & Thrust style and rules, this criticism no longer applies.|$|R

50|$|For the {{purposes}} of calling blows, all heavy-weapons combatants {{are considered to be}} armored in a chain mail hauberk, with an open-faced helmet with a nasal. For that reason, a <b>draw</b> <b>cut</b> or glancing blow would have no effect, while a solid blow would. (Mail protects well against a slicing blade; it transmits most of the force of a blow.) Good strikes to the torso and head are treated as a 'killing blow'.|$|E
50|$|A trammel of Archimedes is a {{mechanism}} that generates {{the shape of}} an ellipse. It consists of two shuttles which are confined ("") to perpendicular channels or rails, and a rod which is attached to the shuttles by pivots at fixed positions along the rod. As the shuttles move back and forth, each along its channel, the end of the rod moves in an elliptical path. The semi-axes a and b of the ellipse have lengths equal to the distances {{from the end of the}} rod to each of the two pivots.An ellipsograph is a trammel of Archimedes intended to <b>draw,</b> <b>cut,</b> or machine ellipses, e.g. in wood or other sheet materials. An ellipsograph has the appropriate instrument (pencil, knife, router, etc.) attached to the rod. Usually the distances a and b are adjustable, so that the size and shape of the ellipse can be varied.|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} algorithm, HALO, {{is given}} to compute haloed line drawings of wire frame objects. (Haloed line drawings are described by Appel et al. in ACM Computer Graphics (SIG- GRAPH' 79 Proceedings), Vol. 1 -) pp. 151 - 157 (August 1979).) HALO has two parts: CUT and <b>DRAW.</b> <b>CUT</b> uses an adaptive grid to find all edge intersections. It overlays a square grid, whose fineness {{is a function of}} the number and length of the edges, on the scene. It determines the cells that each edge passes through, sorts these by cell to obtain the edges in each cell, and then, in each cell, tests each pair of edges in that cell for intersection For broad classes of input this takes time linear in the number of edges plus the number of intersections CUT writes a file containing all the locations where each edge is crossed in front by another. Given a halo width, DRAW reads this file edge by edge For each edge, it sub- tracts and adds the halo width to each intersection to. get the locations where the edge becomes invisible and visible. It sorts these along the edge, and then traverses the edge, plot- ting those portions where the number of "visible" transitions is equal to the number of "invisible" transitions DRAW takes time linear in the number of edge segments. Dividing HALO into two parts means that redrawing a plot with a different halo width is fast, since only DRAW need be rerun...|$|E

50|$|In a 19th-century whaling harbor, the peg-legged {{captain of}} the Komquot is obsessed with {{catching}} the great white whale Dicky Moe {{to the point of}} <b>drawing</b> <b>cuts</b> of meat on Dicky Moe's picture, then eating the picture. His obsession frightens his crew so badly that they all desert the ship in fear, angering the captain for their cowardly behavior. Shortly afterward, the captain finds Tom searching for food in the harbor, knocks him out and takes him aboard. Tom believes at first that he is going on a cruise, but the captain soon puts him to work scrubbing the deck.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} blade designs for pruning shears: anvil, bypass and parrot-beak. Anvil pruners {{have only one}} blade, which closes onto a flat surface; unlike bypass blades it can be sharpened from both sides and remains reliable when slightly blunt. Anvil pruners are useful for cutting thick branches; one can bite into the stem from one direction, swing the handle around and bite further through narrowed wood from another direction. The anvil is made of a material softer than the blade, so that the blade is not damaged when it meets the anvil. Suitable materials for the anvil are plastic, aluminum, zinc, brass, or bronze alloys. The blades are made from hardened carbon or chromium steels. The hardness of the blades is generally between 54 and 58 HRC. On an anvil pruner, proper cutting is assured even if the blade swerves slightly {{to the left or}} right during cutting. As long as the blade meets the anvil {{at the end of the}} cut and fits tightly against it, the material is separated. For this reason, the blades of anvil pruners can be ground thinner than those on bypass pruners. The LÖWE principle - a <b>drawing</b> <b>cut</b> made against a fixed support - combines a <b>drawing</b> <b>cut</b> with a pushing cut. This is possible because the blade lever and base lever are connected by an eccentric bearing. When the pruners are open, the blade is longer than the anvil thanks to the eccentric bearing. When the pruners close, the blade draws back slightly while it pushes through the material. This reduces the cutting force needed to make a cut still further.|$|R

25|$|The blade {{itself is}} customarily {{divided into three}} {{sections}} for leverage in different offensive and defensive techniques. The tip of the blade is the jiànfeng, meant for stabbing, slashing, and quick percussive cuts. The jiànfeng typically curves smoothly to a point, though in the Ming period sharply angled points were common. Some antiques have rounded points, though these are likely the result of wear. The middle section is the zhongren or middle edge, and is used {{for a variety of}} offensive and defensive actions: cleaving <b>cuts,</b> <b>draw</b> <b>cuts,</b> and deflections. The section of blade closest to the guard is called the jiàngen or root, and is mainly used for defensive actions; on some late period jian, the base of the blade was made into an unsharpened ricasso. These sections are not necessarily of the same length, with the jiànfeng being only three or four inches long.|$|R
