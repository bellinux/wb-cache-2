The VOR <b>flag</b> <b>alarm</b> was set too high and the glide-slope deflection sensitivity indication was set 50% more than its usual operational setting. It didn't prevent the system, but was rather [...] "exacting for the pilots". The faulty settings of the glide-slope alarm circuit prevented the flag appearing until the two signals were unusable or not received. If the faulty unit received an [...] "unsatisfactory signal", the pointer could move to the mid-position. The pilot on the left seat could not notice this failure. This is dangerous. If the pointer moved to the mid-position, the crew would have thought that they were on the correct glide path. Investigators then questioned the airworthiness of the aircraft due to these faults.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: The Objective Structured Clinical Examination was {{designed}} 30 {{years ago by}} Harden. It has been {{thought of as a}} reliable and objective tool to evaluate clinical competences in structured patient encounters. Although generally accepted as a high stake assessment process, reliability, validity and reproducibility of an OSCE still are subject of discussions and concerns. These days the question urges wether a compensatory or an additional rating is advisable for the final pass-fail decision. Aim: The hypothesis is that a yellow card system (red flagging) could help to identify the high risk future clinicians. Method: During 8 OSCE-sessions, which included 354 GP-students, observers were asked to deal a yellow card in case of ‘alarming acts’. These acts were defined as dramatic or dangerous shortcomings on three levels: theoretical, practical and behavioral level. Result: During three academic years, involving 354 students, and eight OSCE-sessions only 41 yellow cards were dealt. Strikingly, one single observer was responsible for one quarter of the allocations. During two sessions half of all yellow cards was dealt to poor performing students. Students remembered with a yellow card were more likely to underperform on all assessments except on the internship. Conclusion: <b>Flagging</b> <b>alarming</b> or critical events during simulated patient encounters does not identify high risk students. Perhaps in future research the evaluation of internships should be stressed in order to guarantee an objective quotation. Finally, the idea of ‘flagging’ is not be abandoned but moved to other assessment situations. status: submitte...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{diagnosis}} of {{irritable bowel syndrome}} (IBS) is based on clinical criteria. Further diagnostic testing is advised for certain “red <b>flag</b> ” <b>alarm</b> or warning signs. Aim: This investigation was designed to examine the yield of testing for “red flags”. methods: Consecutive patients who were prospectively evaluated and met the ROME III criteria for IBS were reviewed for “red flags ” which included: 1) rectal bleeding, 2) iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), 3) weight loss, 4) family history of colon cancer, 5) fever, and 6) age of onset after age 50. The evaluations were reviewed for type of testing and findings. Subjects with nocturnal symptoms and fecal soiling, although not traditional warning signs, were also reviewed. Results: There were 200 patients who met the IBS criteria; 139 (70 %) had a “red <b>flag</b> ” <b>alarm</b> symptom or sign. Diarrhea predominant-IBS (D-IBS) was seen in 105, constipation predominant-IBS (C-IBS) in 57, alternating, mixed, or pain predominant-IBS in 38. There were 30 men and 170 women. Testing was not often performed in this setting and, when done, the yield was low with few clinically significant diagnostic findings. Conclusion: There was a high prevalence of “red flag ” symptoms or signs in the prospectively evaluated IBS cohort, but a low frequency of diagnostic testing directed at the investigation of these symptoms or signs. Further systematic study may show that the yield for testing in IBS is low even when “red flags” prompt diagnostic testing. Key words Irritable bowel symptoms – alarm – diagnostic testing...|$|R

METHODS: A previously validated Malay language Rome III IBS diagnostic questionnaire {{was used in the}} current study. A prospective sample of 232 Malay subjects (80 % power) was initially screened. Using a stratified random sampling strategy, a total of 221 Malay subjects (112 subjects in a &#x 201 C;full time job&#x 201 D; and 109 subjects in &#x 201 C;no full time job&#x 201 D;) were recruited. Subjects were visitors (friends and relatives) within the hospital compound and were representative of the local community. Red <b>flags</b> and psychosocial <b>alarm</b> symptoms were also assessed in the current study using previously translated and validated questionnaires. Subjects with IBS were sub-typed into constipation-predominant, diarrhea-predominant, mixed type and un-subtyped. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to test for association between socioeconomic factors and presence of red <b>flags</b> and psychosocial <b>alarm</b> features among the Malays with IBS. RESULTS: IBS was present in 10. 9 % (24 / 221), red flags in 22. 2 % (49 / 221) and psychosocial alarm features in 9. 0 % (20 / 221). Red flags were more commonly reported in subjects with IBS (83. 3 %) than psychosocial alarm features (20. 8 %, P 50 years old and this was reported by 16. 7 % of subjects with IBS.

40|$|Urbanization {{of animal}} {{habitats}} {{has the potential}} to affect the natural communication systems of any species able to survive in the changed environment. Urban animals such as squirrels use multiple signal channels to communicate, but it is unknown how urbanization has affected these behaviors. Multimodal communication, involving more than one sensory modality, can be studied by use of biomimetic mechanical animal models that are designed to simulate the multimodal signals and be presented to animal subjects in the field. In this way the responses to the various signal components can be compared and contrasted to determine whether the multimodal signal is made up of redundant or nonredundant components. In this study we presented wild gray squirrels in relatively urban and relatively rural habitats in Western Massachusetts with a biomimetic squirrel model that produced tail <b>flags</b> and <b>alarm</b> barks in a variety of combinations. We found that the squirrels responded to each unimodal component on its own, the bark and tail flag, but they responded most to the complete multimodal signal, containing both the acoustic and the moving visual components, providing evidence that in this context the signal components are redundant and that their combination elicits multimodal enhancement. We expanded on the results of Partan et al. (2009) by providing data on signaling behavior in the presence and absence of conspecifics, suggesting that alarm signaling is more likely if conspecifics are present. We found that the squirrels were more active in the urban habitats and that they responded more to tail flagging in the urban habitats as compared to the rural ones, suggesting the interesting possibility of a multimodal shift from reliance on audio to visual signals in noisier more crowded urban habitats [Current Zoology 56 (3) : 313 – 326, 2010]...|$|R
40|$|Hosts {{connected}} to the Internet continue to suffer attacks with high frequency. The use of an intrusion detector allows potential threats to be <b>flagged.</b> When an <b>alarm</b> is raised, preventive action can be taken. A primary goal of such action is to assure {{the security of the}} data stored in the system. If this operation is effected manually, the delay between the alarm and the response may be enough for an intruder to cause significant damage. The alternative proposed in this paper is to provide a response primitive for intrusion detectors to utilize in automating the response. We describe RICE, a modification to the Java file subsystem that provides such functionality for data that is deemed to be threatened by an attack. If it is activated when an intrusion appears likely to succeed, it guarantees the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the protected data even after a system is compromised. In particular, RICE allows cryptographic encapsulation of data to be reduced to simple key deletion {{so that it can be}} effected rapidly. Further, it uses digitally signed hashes of file deltas to allow untainted data to be distinguished from the rest. Finally, file deltas are replicated at a remote node to ensure that changes made by an attacker can be undone using the remote replicas. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} a simulation study {{to evaluate the}} performances of an anomaly detection algorithm considered {{in the frame of}} an automated surveillance system of cattle mortality. The method consisted in a combination of temporal regression and spatial cluster detection which allows identifying, for a given week, clusters of spatial units showing an excess of deaths in comparison with their own historical fluctuations. First, we simulated 1, 000 outbreaks of a disease causing extra deaths in the French cattle population (about 200, 000 herds and 20 million cattle) according to a model mimicking the spreading patterns of an infectious disease and injected these disease-related extra deaths in an authentic mortality dataset, spanning from January 2005 to January 2010. Second, we applied our algorithm on each of the 1, 000 semi-synthetic datasets to identify clusters of spatial units showing an excess of deaths considering their own historical fluctuations. Third, we verified if the clusters identified by the algorithm did contain simulated extra deaths in order to evaluate the ability of the algorithm to identify unusual mortality clusters caused by an outbreak. Among the 1, 000 simulations, the median duration of simulated outbreaks was 8 weeks, with a median number of 5, 627 simulated deaths and 441 infected herds. Within the 12 -week trial period, 73 % of the simulated outbreaks were detected, with a median timeliness of 1 week, and a mean of 1. 4 weeks. The proportion of outbreak weeks <b>flagged</b> by an <b>alarm</b> was 61 % (i. e. sensitivity) whereas one in three alarms was a true alarm (i. e. positive predictive value). The performances of the detection algorithm were evaluated for alternative combination of epidemiologic parameters. The results of our study confirmed that in certain conditions automated algorithms could help identifying abnormal cattle mortality increases possibly related to unidentified health events...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we have {{developed}} a new orthogonal cryptographic system for database security that has used both Cellular automata and Hash Algorithm. Our Algorithm consists of two different parts; Encryption/Decryption of database tables {{as well as the}} generation of the Authentication Tag for the activation of the attack alarm for the database tables while it is unlocked and in protected mode but it has been accessed by the illegal users. Our proposed orthogonal cryptosystem is considered to be symmetric algorithm and uses a common key for both encryption and decryption processes as oppose to the asymmetric one that requires two keys, private and public keys. Since our transformation matrix is orthogonal, we have used the property of orthogonal matrix to calculate its inverse based on its matrix transpose rather than direct matrix inversion to save the calculation time during the decryption process. We also have generated secret keys by applying the internal rules of cellular automata on the Malakooti Transform (M-T) to obtain the secret key matrix {{that can be used to}} be multiplied with the matrix of ASCII code obtained from the records of the database. To apply another level of security on the resulting encrypted code, the Hash values obtained from each record are multiplied by the elements of the secret key matrix and the XOR operation is performed on the resulting values and the elements of the encrypted codes. In addition, we also proposed a robust and fast algorithm for the database security and authentication that automatically and accurately will generate the Hash values for the entire rows of the database tables to obtain a unique Hash value for each table. This unique hash value can be used to check the validity of the data inside the database and guarantee the authentication of all information in each database. Our proposed method is capable of detecting any slight change that might be occurs on the database while it is in the protected mode. The generated Hash value will be calculated from the records elements of the database periodically to be compared with the value of the Hash value stored outside database for the authentication. Should the generated Hash value be different from the stored Hash value, the <b>alarm</b> <b>flag</b> would be activated to inform the administrator about unauthorized change of database while in protected mode via SMS or Email...|$|R
40|$|With over ﬁfty eruptive episodes (Strombolian activity, lava fountains, and lava ﬂows) between 2006 and 2013, Mt Etna, Italy, underscored {{its role}} as the most active volcano in Europe. Seven {{paroxysmal}} lava fountains at the South East Crater occurred in 2007 - 2008 and 46 at the New South East Crater between 2011 and 2013. Month-lasting lava emissions affected the upper eastern ﬂank of the volcano in 2006 and 2008 - 2009. On this background, effective monitoring and forecast of volcanic phenomena are a ﬁrst order issue for their potential socio-economic impact in a densely populated region like the town of Catania and its surroundings. For example, explosive activity has often formed thick ash clouds with widespread tephra fall able to disrupt the air trafﬁc, {{as well as to}} cause severe problems at infrastructures, such as highways and roads. For timely information on changes {{in the state of the}} volcano and possible onset of dangerous eruptive phenomena, the analysis of the continuous background seismic signal, the so-called volcanic tremor, turned out of paramount importance. Changes in the state of the volcano as well as in its eruptive style are usually concurrent with variations of the spectral characteristics (amplitude and frequency content) of tremor. The huge amount of digital data continuously acquired by INGV’s broadband seismic stations every day makes a manual analysis difﬁcult, and techniques of automatic classiﬁcation of the tremor signal are therefore applied. The application of unsupervised classiﬁcation techniques to the tremor data revealed signiﬁcant changes well before the onset of the eruptive episodes. This evidence led to the development of speciﬁc software packages related to real-time processing of the tremor data. The operational characteristics of these tools – fail-safe, robustness with respect to noise and data outages, as well as computational efﬁciency – allowed the identiﬁcation of criteria for automatic <b>alarm</b> <b>ﬂagging.</b> The system is hitherto one of the main automatic alerting tools to identify impending eruptive events at Etna. The currently operating software named KKAnalysis is applied to the data stream continuously recorded at two seismic stations. The data are merged with reference datasets of past eruptive episodes. In doing so, the results of pattern classiﬁcation can be immediately compared to previous eruptive scenarios. Given the rich material collected in recent years, here we propose the application of the alert system to a wider range (up to a total of eleven) stations at different elevations (1200 - 3050 m) and distances (1 - 8 km) from the summit craters. Critical alert parameters were empirically deﬁned to obtain an optimal tuning of the alert system for each station. To verify the robustness of this new, multistation alert system, a dataset encompassing about eight years of continuous seismic records (since 2006) was processed automatically using KKAnalysis and collateral software ofﬂine.

40|$|Over fifty eruptive episodes with Strombolian activity, lava fountains, and {{lava flows}} {{occurred}} at Mt Etna volcano between 2006 and 2013. Namely, {{there were seven}} paroxysmal lava fountains at the South-East Crater in 2007 - 2008 and 46 at the New South-East Crater between 2011 and 2013. Lava emissions lasting months affected the upper eastern flank of the volcano in 2006 and 2008 - 2009. Effective monitoring and forecast of such volcanic phenomena are particularly relevant for their potential socio-economic impact in densely populated regions like Catania and its surroundings. For example, explosive activity has often formed thick ash clouds with widespread tephra fall able to disrupt the air traffic, {{as well as to}} cause severe problems at infrastructures, such as highways and roads. Timely information about changes {{in the state of the}} volcano and possible onset of dangerous eruptive phenomena requires efficacious surveillance methods. The analysis of the continuous background seismic signal, the so-called volcanic tremor, turned out of paramount importance to follow the evolution of volcanic activity [e. g., Alparone et al., 2003; Falsaperla et al., 2005]. Changes in the state of the volcano as well as in its eruptive style are usually concurrent with variations of the spectral characteristics (amplitude and frequency) of tremor. The huge amount of digital data continuously acquired by INGV’s broadband seismic stations every day makes a manual analysis difficult. In order to tackle this problem, techniques of automatic classification of the tremor signal are applied. In a comparative study, the robustness of different methods for the identification of regimes in volcanic activity were examined [Langer et al., 2009]. In particular, Langer et al. [2011] applied unsupervised classification techniques to the tremor data recorded at one station during seven paroxysmal episodes in 2007 - 2008. Their results revealed significant changes in the pattern classification well before the onset of the eruptive episodes. This evidence led to the development of specific software packages, such as the program KKAnalysis [Messina and Langer, 2011], a software that combines an unsupervised classification method (Kohonen Maps) with fuzzy cluster analysis. The operational characteristics of these tools - fail-safe, robustness with respect to noise and data outages, as well as computational efficiency - allowed on-line processing at the operative centre of the INGV-Osservatorio Etneo in 2010 and the identification of criteria for automatic <b>alarm</b> <b>flagging.</b> The system is hitherto one of the main automatic alerting tools to identify impending eruptive events at Etna. The software carries out the on-line processing of the new data stream coming from two seismic stations, merged with reference datasets of past eruptive episodes. In doing so, results obtained for new data are immediately compared to previous eruptive scenarios. Given the rich material collected in recent years, we are able to apply the alert system to eleven stations at different elevations (1200 - 3050 m) and distances (1 - 8 km) from the summit craters. Critical alert parameters were empirically defined to obtain an optimal tuning of the alert system for each station. To verify the robustness of this new, multistation alert system, a dataset encompassing about eight years of continuous seismic records (since 2006) was processed automatically using KKAnalysis and collateral software off-line. Then, we analyzed the performance of the classifier in terms of timing and spatial distribution of the stations. We also investigated the performance of the new alert system based on KKAnalysis in case of activation of whatever eruptive centre. Intriguing results were obtained in 2010 throughout periods characterized by the renewal of volcanic activity at Bocca Nuova-Voragine and North-East Crater, and in the absence of paroxysmal phenomena at South-East Crater and New South-East Crater. Despite the low-energy phenomena reported by volcanologists (i. e., degassing, low-to moderate explosions), the triggered alarms demonstrate the robustness of the classifier and its potential: i) to identify even subtle changes within the volcanic system using tremor, and ii) to highlight the activation of a single eruptive centre, even though different from the one for which the classifier was initially tested. It is worth noting that in case of activation of weak sources, the successful performance of the classifier depends upon the general level of signals originating from other sources in that specific time span...|$|R
