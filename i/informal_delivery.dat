To begin with, any mail from America to Dawson City was sent to Juneau in South-east Alaska before being sent through Dawson and then down the Yukon to Circle City. From here it was then distributed by the US Post Office back up to Dawson. The huge distances involved resulted in delays of several months and frequently the loss of protective envelopes and their addresses. The second problem was in Dawson itself, which initially lacked a post office and therefore relied on two stores and a saloon to act as <b>informal</b> <b>delivery</b> points. The NWMP were tasked to run the mail system by October 1897, but they were ill-trained to do so. Up to 5,700 letters might arrive in a single shipment, all of which had to be collected in person from the post office. This resulted in huge queues, with claimants lining up outside the office for up to three days. Those who had no time and could afford it would pay others to stand in line for them, preferably a woman since they were allowed to get ahead in line out of politeness. Postage stamps, like paper in general, were scarce and rationed to two per customer. By 1899, trained postal staff took over mail delivery and relieved the NWMP of this task.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. U. R. P.) -University of Natal, Durban, 1995. One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} and dramatic features of recent city development is the phenomenon of access to land through informal means, which {{is a reflection of the}} lack of alternative delivery systems. Constraints on the supply of land for housing the urban poor have resulted in a large housing backlog, reSUlting in overcrowding, the emergence of unplanned housing such as backyard shacks and free standing informal settlements. In South Africa, the majority of the popUlation who have been historically constrained by racist and restrictive land allocation processes found it difficult to access well located and affordable serviced land. These constraints have resulted in poor people obtaining access to land through <b>informal</b> <b>delivery</b> systems. This effective exclusion of the urban poor from the formal land market has resulted in the emergence of the informal systems of land delivery, such as land invasions etc. Both internationally and in South Africa, informal settlements and squatting have represented a way of addressing and challenging market relations and state regUlation and thus, allow for poorer people to move into better located areas. The existing informal settlement within the Cato Manor area (Cato Crest) can be regarded as an example of this kind of urban process. The purpose of this dissertation is to assess the performance of the <b>informal</b> <b>delivery</b> systems in Cato Crest, to establish whether these systems have reached the urban poor and to look for ways of dealing with informal land mechanisms in the future. The findings from the survey indicated that in Cato Crest these illegal land supply systems have benefitted poor people in terms of job opportunities, proximity to the city and location. A number of recommendations can be made in this regard: that there is a need for a land policy on informal land supply systems, that which should seek to make strategically located land available for low income housing in the future. If this is not accomplished, illegal land occupation will continue unabated until no land will be available for low income housing...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the patterns of transitional employment (TE) aspirations and training and development (T&D) needs of women within local government. Design/methodology/approach – A quantitative survey methodology was used to identify aspirations in a sample of 1, 068 employees from the Australian Local Government Association. Findings – Mature-aged women were very interested in continuous learning at work despite their limited formal education. Their training preferences consisted of <b>informal</b> <b>delivery</b> face-to-face or online in the areas of management or administration. Younger women were interested in undertaking university courses, while a minority were interested in blue collar occupations. Practical implications – Through the identification of patterns of TE and T&D aspirations, long term strategies to develop and retain women in local government may be developed. Findings suggest that mature-aged women would benefit from additional T&D to facilitate entry into management and senior administration positions, as well as strategies to facilitate a shift in organizational climate. Social implications – Mature-aged women were found to be a potentially untapped resource for management and senior administrative roles owing to their interest in developing skills in these fields and pursuing TE. Younger women may also benefit from T&D to maintain their capacity during breaks from employment. Encouragement of women in non-traditional areas may also address skill shortages in the local government. Originality/value – Mature-aged women were found to be a potentially untapped resource for management and senior administrative roles owing to their interest in developing skills in these fields and pursuing TE. Younger women may also benefit from T&D to maintain their capacity during breaks from employment.

40|$|Thesis (M. Housing) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2006. This study {{looks at}} the {{potential}} contribution of <b>informal</b> housing <b>delivery</b> in establishing enabling low-income housing standards in Kitwe, Zambia {{as a way of}} addressing the shortage of adequate and affordable housing for the urban poor. <b>Informal</b> housing <b>delivery</b> is increasingly being seen as the urban poors' response to the chronic shortage of housing in most cities in developing countries. Proponents of <b>informal</b> housing <b>delivery</b> have been alluding to the many positive impacts that informal housing has on the poor households since the 1960 's. This aspect is slowly gaining acceptance in many housing policies in developing countries that are now opting to work with rather than forcefully relocated informal dwellers. The Zambia National Housing Policy set an ambitious list of objectives aimed at realising its goal of providing adequate and affordable housing to all income groups in the country, including the reform of housing standards which currently inhibit the incorporation of informal housing techniques and materials into conventional practices. However, {{there appears to be no}} framework within which this objective will be achieved. The study, therefore, investigated the positive attributes of <b>informal</b> housing <b>delivery</b> through a literature review of standards and general discourse and policies regarding traditional, informal and formal housing settlements. Through the literature review, a set of indicators was established to measure and analyse informal housing standards prevailing in Kamatipa, an informal settlement north of the city of Kitwe in Zambia and building regulations that substantially hinder the incorporation of these standards into conventional low-income housing standards. They study establishes a number of positive attributes of informal housing in Kamatipa and the regulations that they contravene under current standards. It concludes by making recommendations towards establishing guidelines for assimilating these positive elements in a reformed regulatory framework to achieve enabling low-income housing standards in the city and country...|$|R

In addition, increasing housing informality, coupled by uncollected refuse {{and the proliferation of}} the informal sector activities sum-up the limitations of sustainable land governance options.

Many citizens see informal water vendors as businesses controlled by extortionary "mafias" and call for government regulation. This thesis explores whether government regulation is justified in the case of Bangalore, India where water issues have become increasingly pressing and informal water vendors, also known as the "water mafia," have grown in number and in influence. In particular, this thesis will explore whether private tankers display any form of anti-competitive behavior by addressing two questions: 1) Do private water tankers exhibit monopoly power, and 2) Do private water tanker prices vary depending on the characteristics of the customers they serve? Evidence collected in July-August 2014 and January 2015 indicates that tankers do not operate in an anti-competitive manner and that government intervention is not justified on these grounds. However, tankers do contribute to declining groundwater levels and government intervention on these grounds ought to be explored. by Anirudh Rajashekar. Thesis: M. C.

30|$|Since many {{government}} interventions are inefficient {{and lead to}} sub – optimal distributions of land resources, some policy experts argue {{that the best way}} to “manage” land use and development patterns are to rely on market forces. On the other hand, without planning and regulations, land markets are likely to generate enormous external costs and fail to produce public spaces. In fact, without government intervention critical public facilities such as parks, open spaces, and major infrastructure and urban services, which the private sector cannot profitably produce and sell, will not be provided. Thus, the solution to ineffective and counterproductive urban land policies is not to do away with governments interventions and policy initiatives, but to find the proper balance between the public and private sector regarding urban land development and management (Yirsaw, 2010). The six cities use different strategies and approaches to land management and such approaches have their own strengths and drawbacks. In Kigali, for example, decentralised land management structures have proved to be effective since leaders are accessible and the land registration processes are quickest. Unlike, in Harare, where there is too much centralisation of land management, characterised by bureaucracy, corruption and lengthy land acquisition, land allocation and land registration processes. Formal public land management strategies have been ineffective in involving the urban poor in land markets, and this has seen <b>informal</b> land <b>delivery</b> systems giving the poor an opportunity to participate in the governance of urban land markets.|$|R
30|$|Private sector {{involvement}} in policymaking in general, including land and land management policy, is minimal in Ethiopia. Public-private partnership is virtually absent. Before the nationalization of urban land in 1975, both {{urban and rural}} lands could be sold, rented, leased, inherited or transferred as a gift. Proclamation 47 / 1975, which introduced the monopoly of land ownership by the state, abolished private ownership of land and banned any form of transaction in land. The state took over total responsibility for land provision, development, and control. Accordingly, urban land management became a highly centralized operation under the then Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (MHUD) that had oversight over {{the implementation of the}} policy through its regional branches and urban dwellers associations established at the city and neighbourhood levels (Yusuf, et al. 2009). Major challenges in land management in Ethiopian cities arise because of rising urban informality. The major cause of such informality has been the challenges or flaws associated with the land administration process among other factors that relate to historical land tenure systems and urbanisation. The demise of the formal land supply has subsequently seen the emergence of opportunistic and informal of land supply tendencies. Many households have turned to the informal land markets to compensate for the deficits of the formal land supply market. Rent seeking behaviour has also been on the rise in the private market, with the bulk of private land suppliers resorting to speculative behaviour responsible hiking the value of land parcels. The deteriorating land supply situation in Addis Ababa has seen most people resorting to <b>informal</b> land <b>delivery</b> systems.|$|R

Patterns of both informal care provided and received by older adults in the Republic of Ireland (RoI) and Northern Ireland (NI) were evaluated. A cross-sectional community-based population survey was conducted. Randomly selected older people (aged 65 +, n = 2033, mean age (standard deviation) : 74. 1 years (6. 8), 43 % men, 68 % response rate) provided information on the provision and receipt of care, its location, and the person(s) who provided the care. Twelve per cent of the sample (251 / 2033) identified themselves as informal caregivers (8 % RoI and 17 % NI). Caregivers {{were more likely to}} be women, married, have less education and have less functional impairment. Forty-nine per cent (1033 / 2033, 49 % RoI and 48 % NI) reported receiving some form of care in the past year. Care recipients {{were more likely to be}} older, married, have more functional impairment, and poorer self-rated health. Receiving regular informal care (help at least once a week) from a non-resident relative was the most common form of help received [28 % overall (578 / 2033); 27 % RoI and 30 % NI]. Five per cent (n = 102 / 2033) of the sample reported both providing and receiving informal care. Levels of informal care provided by community-dwelling older adults were notably higher than reported in single-item national census questions. The balance of formal and informal health and social care will become increasingly important as populations age. It is essential, therefore, to evaluate factors facilitating or impeding <b>informal</b> care <b>delivery...</b>|$|R
30|$|Effective {{urban land}} control {{is crucial to}} {{tackling}} growing land use problems such as slum formation, rising costs of land, accessibility to urban land for land housing, incompatible use, flooding, overcrowding and congestion among others {{for the purpose of}} achieving sustainable city development and ensure the safety and health of the people. There is increasing poor performance of formal (public) land management in providing land for housing, registering titles and land transfers, regulating access to and use of urban land as well as providing basic infrastructure services. The deficits of the public sector have, however, been largely compensated by the increasing importance of an informal subsystem in housing land development (Kombe and Kreibich 2001). The Emerging challenges in land management among African cities include poor management of land and poor governance frameworks, lack of appropriate land administration systems to deal with increasing shortages of serviced land and well-located land, widespread <b>informal</b> land <b>delivery</b> systems, highly centralised land agencies, incomplete land records and poor public land management. The obtaining trends on the ground indicate deterioration in the tenure status and access to land for the poor (UNCHS 2001). Public and private formal land delivery systems have failed to cope with the needs of the urban poor. One of the notable deficiencies of the formal land delivery system in urban areas of the developing world has been (as argued earlier on), the emergency and proliferation of informal elements. Informality has manifested itself at various scales of the land management system, including land acquisition, land delivery process, land titling among others. Among a host of other symptoms of such deficiencies have been the proliferation of illegal settlements and the unprecedented rise of legal disputes associated with land management issues.|$|R
30|$|Johannesburg is South Africa’s {{economic}} powerhouse and {{the most}} popular metropolitan city in the country. The metropolitan area covers 1, 644 km 2; it is a rapidly growing city, with a population in excess of 3.2 million. The growth rate is 3 - 4 % per annum, resulting from natural increase, as well as in-migration from surrounding areas {{within and outside the}} country (Planact, 2007). The rapid growth of Johannesburg has created several problems in terms of services provision and general <b>delivery.</b> <b>Informal</b> settlements, in (and around) the city, lack in basic housing requirements including adequate basic services and amenities; as well as reliable transport. In light of this, the large population of migrants in Johannesburg lack access to the formal urban economy (that is, formal employment, formal housing) which explains the most of these people live in informal settlements, overcrowded rental accommodation and involved in informal employment. In fact, it is estimated that between 150, 000 and 220, 000 households in Johannesburg live in informal dwellings (ibid). The situation in Johanesburg today is, to a large extent, an after effect of the colonial land administration policies in the country.|$|R
40|$|To the visitor, Istanbul, Turkey is {{flush with}} food. But food supply {{and access to}} food can be unrelated. Socioeconomic, {{demographic}} and development data suggest food security problems for {{a significant portion of}} the population. After World War II, migrants to Istanbul from Anatolia who built house gardens within their original squatter settlements (gecekondus) have sold their lands or turned them into apartments. Similarly, only fragments of the traditional network of commercial, intensive urban gardens (bostans) in Istanbul remain. In addition, the expanding system of European style supermarkets and commercial production in the global marketplace are changing the traditional urban food networks built around such institutions as the neighborhood bazaar. To begin to understand the shifting components of Istanbul's food system, information from numerous sources was gathered and analyzed. The main field data of my research are interviews with Istanbul farmers and residents; interviews with government officials, academics, and professionals; official and unofficial statistics from governments and associations; and surveys. Supplementary information is from Turkish newspaper sources, library materials, and various books and maps. Through kinship relations, labor mobility, the availability of formal and informal economic and transportation networks and the persistence of small, family farms nationwide, food security in Istanbul is supported by food individually and communally transferred from the countryside. Subsistence agricultural production across rural Turkey appears to play a vital role in feeding the urban population through <b>informal</b> food <b>delivery</b> and distribution channels. Thus, despite reductions in rural populations and appearances that rural and agricultural communities are declining, their productivity may be as important as ever. With their emphases on resource use, adaptation, consideration of multiple scales, and the exercise of local agency within structures of power and wealth, political and cultural ecology provide perspectives from which to meaningfully analyze food security needs and practices in Istanbul. Such a framework is enhanced by contributions from research in food systems and food security. Time centered tactics, exchange entitlements and food accessibility within the city cannot be understood apart from its relationship to the countryside...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{the thesis}} is to explore the nature of {{informal}} land development in Cebu City, the Philippines, and to evaluate the impacts on shelter, particularly among the urban poor. More specific objectives are to examine who gains access to informal land, how the process of informal land alienation and turnover occurs, and which actors are involved in <b>informal</b> land <b>delivery.</b> The research uses primary data from 243 household interviews conducted in 5 informal settlements in urban Cebu to assess how informal land sales influence the socio-economic composition of settlements. The research also examines whether {{there is evidence of}} residential segregation among informal settlements according to income and the implications of this for urban settlement and levels of poverty. The research also draws on detailed interviews with 25 land agents to explore their roles in these processes. Similar to other studies the research acknowledges that informal lands are undergoing significant commercialisation, mainly because of the demand imposed on informal plots by high land prices in the formal market. This has made titled property unaffordable to the urban poor and a less attractive option to middle income groups. The research particularly highlights how the behaviour of middle income buyers in the informal land market creates bottlenecks in the supply of plots (by buying large plots for occupation, leaving purchased plots vacant and also accelerating plot prices through speculation, for example). In addition, since poorer residents are vulnerable to "crisis selling" of land and generally have a lower perception of plot value, they do not always receive a fair price for their plots, which reduces their ability to repurchase land at a later date. The research concludes that these processes exacebate residential segregation between households on the basis of income and has led to great disparities in settlement densities, infrastructure and service availability. The latter are vital issues for urban policy, social development and poverty considerations...|$|R
40|$|The term <b>informal</b> land <b>delivery</b> {{processes}} or simplistically {{referred to}} as ‘squatting’ are not new terms, {{they have been in}} existence for a long time; however very little in – depth research have been done to understanding exactly how they function – the relationship between the institutions (rules and social norms) and actors involved. Most studies on informal settlements have traditionally centered {{on how to deal with}} the “housing problem” in developing countries. The main strategy of this research not centred on how to deal with the “housing problem” but rather (re) search reasons responsible for the existence of this problem in the first place. Hence, rather than explaining (limited to looking at the ends), this research aims at describing the means – the causes and the social mechanisms through which urban poverty persists, especially those that fall beyond narrow income – consumption concerns, or individual entitlements mediated by legal and market systems (Mosse, 2010; Gore, 1993; Kabeer, 1994; Green and Hulme, 2005). The main focus therefore is to understand the process of formation and development of three specific squatter settlements in the context of Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, one of the least developed countries in South Asia. The research takes Marx’s ontology and his conception of method within a relational perspective as a starting point in order to address core issues of inequalities following the path of Burgess (1977; 1997; etc) and other neo Marxists. Network analysis is used as a primary basis for understanding the relationship between elements (which in this case are households) that form the totality (squatter settlements). Furthermore, concept of relational social capital is also used to analyze the positions and structures within this totality. The research adopts a qualitative, case study method where the three specific squatter settlements are the main case study areas and households are the embedded units of analysis (i. e. the cases). Out of 53 squatter settlements within Kathmandu Valley, three case study areas are selected for this research. In terms of the main unit of analysis – the households, a number of diverse cases from each of the different category of households within the owners and renter/tenants were selected. The empirical data for this research was generated over a period of approximately 8 months divided into three main research fieldwork phases. This PhD thesis is based on four main Appended Articles, each compiled at the end of three subsequent research fieldwork phases. This research is based on three main theoretical perspectives each discussed in the four main articles: <b>informal</b> land <b>delivery</b> processes (Articles I and II); social capital (Article III) and governance/planning in the global south (insurgent planning practices) (Articles IV). Through this literature review (which is the basis for the Supplementary Articles), the researcher found gaps in terms of the influence of global housing policies in developing countries. This gap was addressed within the perspective of <b>informal</b> land <b>delivery</b> processes (more specifically in Articles II) in which the critiques of three mainstream global housing policy recommendations (Turner, De Soto and Putnam) are taken further. As a continuation of this, the theoretical basis for Article III was a critique of Putnam’s definition of social capital as well as arguments supporting the need for a relational perspective in order to analysis of the formation and development of the three specific squatter settlements. Lastly, the theoretical perspective of insurgent planning practices in Article IV was a context-driven perspective as a result of eviction of a riverside squatter settlement during the research process. Some of the key findings from this research reveals that process of access to land both during the formation as well as development of each of these three squatter settlements were hinged on a vertical, client – patron type of relationship with the local governments and non- government organizations. The process of initial access to land and temporary housing units (formation) begins with the pioneer/starter household heads mobilizing their networks to yield the return of initial access to land and building temporary housing units. Whereas the development/consolidation process (maintaining access to land) begins with collective action where the starter/pioneer households secure and strengthen the initial access to land by collecting or bringing together other owner types of households such as consolidators and eventually renter/tenant types of households. This process is further consolidated through the arrival of ‘formal’ infrastructure which in all these three case study areas was through the support of a local NGO and was later also backed by the local governments. The analysis also illustrates the heterogeneity in terms of the household types and the specific types of land occupied by each of the squatter settlements (either marginal or alienated). Furthermore, key findings directed more towards the role of networks during the formation and development of these three squatter settlements reveal that “dark-side” of the concept of social capital. One of the main critiques of social capital is that it fails to address issues of inequalities at the initial phase of access within the network of social capital. Through the above illustration of the process of gaining access to land by households, one can clearly examine that social capital is only beneficial to those households who have preexisting network resources and locations; hence creating structural inequalities. Therefore being able to gain access to the various network resources is already an achievement for the owner type of households (starter/pioneer and consolidators) within each of the three squatter settlements. The findings also reveal the exclusion of more vulnerable groups through the rise of two distinct settlement types – open and closed networks after the development process. Two of the case study areas show signs of being closed-network types of settlements where entry is restricted as a result both of these settlements primarily comprise of starter/pioneer; old and intermediate consolidator households. Whereas one of the case study areas which also has a large number of renter/tenant households follows the path of an open-network type of settlement with no entry restrictions for new-consolidator or renter/tenant households. Without a relational perspective, understanding the process of formation and development of these three squatter settlements in the above manner would not have been possible. Overall, this PhD research illustrates the strength and value of Marx’s ontology within a relational perspective for understanding the formation and development of three specific squatter settlements in Kathmandu, Nepal. In addition, the research also highlights the significance of critical Marxist analysis specifically in the context of planning research which is still relevant in this age of neoliberal hegemony...|$|R

Also considered {{is the issue of}} how {{to meet the needs of}} children and adolescents who may present mental health problems in Latin America, given that most of them live in poverty in economies that are underdeveloped, providing limited resources. Method: Ten studies from six different countries were identified that employed some form of randomized sampling method and used standardized instruments for assessment. the authors present a summary of the main characteristics of these studies, highlighting methodological features that may account for differences in the rates obtained. Results: Overall, a similar pattern of prevalence and risk factors for mental health problems in children and adolescents in Latin American countries emerged. Moreover, rates of disorders in these children are similar to the 15 to 20 % found in other countries. These findings are similar to those observed when adult mental health problems are considered. Prevention and treatment strategies are discussed and the peculiarities of the delivery of mental health services for children and adolescents are explored. Conclusions: Future research needs to focus on understanding of resilience and formal and <b>informal</b> mental health <b>delivery</b> systems of care available in different Latin American countries.

Informal settlement areas, slums, face grave challenges of inadequate municipal service delivery. The impact of solid waste management is related to impacts caused by lacking water and sanitation, through the common issue of public health. Service delivery varies among the residents within a city, and reflects the historical background and the current priorities of the municipality. Livelihood opportunities in the informal settlements are shaped by the organisation of urban space, setting the preconditions for access to services, level of inclusion in decision-making and forming of the ‘social self’. This paper investigates the solid waste management system within the capital of Namibia, Windhoek, with a special focus on the informal settlement areas. The direct livelihood impacts of inadequate SWM and general service delivery are visible through unhealthy living environments. The physical surroundings reflect the marginalised and peripheral status of the informal and illegal settlers in Windhoek. The residents’ awareness of connections between waste and livelihood varies, and is often limited to concrete issues in the neighbourhood, and not to structural arrangements and inequities within Windhoek.

Due to the existing law in England and Wales regarding parents' right of withdrawal from classes, only boys of 16 or over were used in this research. Boys want teachers to be empathetic, non-judgmental and able to create a 'safe environment' in order to facilitate the discussion of difficult subjects. Most boys believed that the age and sex of the teacher had little bearing on whether they could deliver the subject well; more important was their ability to generate trust, keep control of classes and use relaxed and <b>informal</b> methods of <b>delivery.</b> Unanimously the boys believed that history and English teachers were more able to fulfil these requirements whereas science and mathematics teachers were considered to be unable to adapt to the relaxed styles required.
