40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} use of management accounting systems by general <b>managers</b> and <b>department</b> <b>managers</b> in luxury hotels. We also investigate general managers' emphasis on financial and non-financial performance indicators while they evaluate their department managers' performance. In addition, managers' satisfaction with details and availability of their hotel's management accounting system (MAS) is assessed. The results indicate that general <b>managers</b> and <b>department</b> <b>managers</b> make equal use of MAS for both short and long-term decisions. However, a detail {{analysis of the data}} by manager groups indicates that general <b>managers</b> differ from <b>department</b> <b>managers</b> with respect to their use of MAS for making decisions. Furthermore, general <b>managers,</b> compared to <b>department</b> <b>managers,</b> are found to be more satisfied with the frequency in which MAS is available to them. On the issue of department managers' performance evaluations by general managers, the results reveal that general managers put more emphasis on financial than on non-financial performance indicators. The <b>department</b> <b>managers</b> in the study were in charge of food and beverage and room departments. The sample is rather small; only 35 managers from one region in Australia participated in the study. Therefore, any generalisation of the results requires caution. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} from an implementation standpoint {{to understand how}} information systems are used and what motivates individuals to use them. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study of dealership performance and the use of a computer-based information system by an automobile importer. The study reports results at the dealer and the <b>department</b> <b>manager</b> level. Extensive performance data were available from the manufacturer while dealers and <b>department</b> <b>managers</b> completed questionnaires. A descriptive model of information systems use and performance guided the research. The results of the analysis suggest that the use of reports is more strongly related to performance for dealers than for <b>department</b> <b>managers.</b> The dealer's style is associated with performance while dealer use of information and perceptions of the dealer's style are associated with <b>department</b> <b>manager</b> performance and information use. The implications of the study for decision makers and systems designers are discussed. ...|$|R
