Since the expensive sample interpolation and shading is no longer necessary, we can obtain near-interactive framerates {{for a variety of}} datasets, while our RLE-based compression of linearly varying sample runs helps keep the storage complexity down, with little decompression overhead.

40|$|Figure 1 : Monte Carlo volume {{rendering}} with (b, d) {{and without}} (a, c) transfer function parameter tuning. Although Monte Carlo Volume Rendering (MCVR) is an efficient point-based technique for generating simulated X-ray images from large CT data, its practical application in medical imaging systems {{is limited by}} the relatively expensive preprocessing. The quality of images is strongly influenced by the transfer function, which maps a data value onto a sampling probability. An appropriate transfer function concentrates the point samples onto the region of interest. Since it is data dependent, a fine parameter tuning is necessary. However, the costly preprocessing has to be repeated whenever the transfer function parameters are modified. In this paper a new preprocessing algorithm is proposed for MCVR, which allows for an <b>interactive</b> <b>transfer</b> function control in the rendering phase, providing a visual feedback in a couple of seconds. In order to rapidly recompute point samples according to the modified transfer function, an efficient hybrid sampling strategy is applied, which combines the advantages of the probabilistic Monte Carlo sampling and the deterministic quasi-Monte Carlo sampling...|$|E

40|$|Direct volume {{rendering}} {{has become}} a popular method for visualizing volumetric datasets. Even though computers are continually getting faster, it remains a challenge to incorporate sophisticated illumination models into direct volume rendering while maintaining interactive frame rates. In this paper, we present a novel approach for advanced illumination in direct volume rendering based on GPU ray-casting. Our approach features directional soft shadows taking scattering into account, ambient occlusion and color bleeding effects while achieving very competitive frame rates. In particular, multiple dynamic lights and <b>interactive</b> <b>transfer</b> function changes are fully supported. Commonly, direct volume rendering {{is based on a}} very simplified discrete version of the original volume rendering integral, including the development of the original exponential extinction into a-blending. In contrast to a-blending forming a product when sampling along a ray, the original exponential extinction coefficient is an integral and its discretization a Riemann sum. The fact that it is a sum can cleverly be exploited to implement volume lighting effects, i. e. soft directional shadows, ambient occlusion and color bleeding. We will show how this can be achieved and how it can be implemented on the GPU...|$|E

These mechanistic processes comprising this sequential initiation train serve several functions. First, some create the physically-structured environment and conditions in the initiation train which are needed to house and propagate other mechanisms associated with energy functions and chemical reaction pathways. Secondly, other detailed mechanisms define the orderly transfer and conversion of energy generated during the initiation train sequence, and thirdly, still other detailed mechanisms provide the kinetically-regulated chemical reactions which control energy release rates and provide the intermediate and final chemical product species which drive the detonation wave front. The rate at which these various mechanisms occur in the initiation train defines the sensitivity of an energetic material.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper has been to {{introduce}} the electron conductive and d-d-interactive individual and composite hypo-d-oxides of the increased altervalent capacity, or their suboxides (Magneli phases), as catalytic supports and therefrom provide: (i) The Strong Metal-Support Interaction (SMSI) effect, and (ii) the Dynamic spillover <b>interactive</b> <b>transfer</b> of primary oxides (M-OH) for further electrode reactions, and thereby advance the overall electrocatalytic activity. The d-band has been pointed out as the bonding, adsorptive and catalytic orbital. In the same context, the phenomenon and significance of the d-d-correlations both in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis are displayed and inferred. Since hypo-d-oxides feature the exchange membrane properties, the higher the altervalent capacity, the higher the spillover effect. Potentiodynamic experiments {{have shown that the}} reversible peak of the primary oxide growth on Pt, Ru and Au supported upon hypo-d-oxides and suboxides becomes distinctly increased in the charge capacity and shifts to remarkably more negative potential values, so that it starts even within the range of H-adatoms desorption, while its reduction extends until and merge with the UPD of hydrogen atoms. With wet tungstenia doped titania supported Pt catalyst in membrane cells these peaks dramatically increase in their charge capacity and reversibly become shrunk with a decreased moisture content in the feeding inert gas mixture, and vice versa. Such distinct potentiodynamic scans, in conjunction with some broaden complementary kinetic electrocatalytic improvements rising from the same hypo-d-oxide and/or suboxide interactive support effects, have been proved to be the best and comparable experimental evidence for the spillover effect of primary oxides...|$|E
