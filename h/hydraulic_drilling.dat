However, {{it was not until}} 1867, when an ore sample was transported to Salt Lake City, that an influx of miners descended into the region. The gold rush led to the establishment of booming mining communities, such as South Pass City and Atlantic City. The placer gold in the streams was exhausted quickly, however, and by 1870 the miners began leaving the region. In 1884, Emile Granier, a French mining engineer, established a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>drilling</b> operation that allowed gold mining to continue. Gold mining was revived in nearby Rock Creek in the 1930s. Additionally, from the 1960s through 1983, a U.S. Steel iron ore mine operated in Atlantic City.|$|E

40|$|An {{effective}} anti-jamming {{system is}} significant {{in improving the}} working reliability of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>drilling</b> rigs. An anti-jamming valve is a core component of an anti-jamming system. A back-propagation (BP) neural network model was established for an anti-jamming valve by analyzing the structure and working principle of an anti-jamming valve on a drilling rig and by utilizing the theory of neural network. The established model was employed and applied with the raw information to a stone pit to perform structural topology optimization and obtain the optimal model. The theoretical feed pressure was determined through calculation and analysis after the rock drill became completely jammed. A comparison between the relative error of computed results and the experimental values shows that the forecast data obtained with the BP model (8 %) are closer to the experimental values than those obtained with the theoretical formula (14 %). The highly nonlinear characteristic of a BP neural network provides a fresh insight into the intellectualization of a drilling rig anti-jamming system...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the work {{presented in this paper}} was to investigate the cutting efficiency with respect to drilling fluid composition by determining and comparing experimentally obtained values for specific energy and rate penetration. The description of a test rig for commercial rotary-percussion drills follows.

The results of a test programmer that was carried out with a type GBH 8 / 65 DCE Bosch electrical rotary-percussion drilling machine on granite are finally reported and commented. It is considered quite encouraging that the performance of the machine investigated is comparable to those reported in the literature for conventional pneumatic and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>drilling</b> machines in dolomites, a rock that opposes a much lower resistance to rock breakage than granite.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a vision-based approach for estimating the configuration of, and providing control signals for, an under-sensored robot manipulator using a single monocular camera. Some remote manipulators, used for decommissioning tasks {{in the nuclear}} industry, lack proprioceptive sensors because electronics are vulnerable to radiation. Additionally, even if proprioceptive joint sensors could be retrofitted, such heavy-duty manipulators are often deployed on mobile vehicle platforms, which are significantly and erratically perturbed when powerful <b>hydraulic</b> <b>drilling</b> or cutting tools are deployed at the end-effector. In these scenarios, it would be beneficial to use external sensory information, e. g. vision, for estimating the robot configuration {{with respect to the}} scene or task. Conventional visual servoing methods typically rely on joint encoder values for controlling the robot. In contrast, our framework assumes that no joint encoders are available, and estimates the robot configuration by visually tracking several parts of the robot, and then enforcing equality between a set of transformation matrices which relate the frames of the camera, world and tracked robot parts. To accomplish this, we propose two alternative methods based on optimisation. We evaluate the performance of our developed framework by visually tracking the pose of a conventional robot arm, where the joint encoders are used to provide ground-truth for evaluating the precision of the vision system. Additionally, we evaluate the precision with which visual feedback can be used to control the robot's end-effector to follow a desired trajectory...|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} {{concerned}} with CFD simulations of jets issued from elliptical nozzles. The investigated jet flow in this project is turbulent flow emanating from microscopic nozzles into a combustion chamber. Jet flows are very common in engineering, medical and environmental applications and are for instance used in fuel injection systems, spray painting and drying. Jet flow devices are also very common in applications such as cutting, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>drilling,</b> cooling and heating. A {{better understanding of the}} flow phenomenons in jet flows are required in order to make these devices function and perform in a more efficient way. The performance of diesel engines is strongly affected by the fuel spray, atomization and in turn the mixing process. This depends ultimately on the dimensions and geometry of the nozzle. The purpose of this project was therefore to investigate different elliptical nozzle geometries which also was compared to a conventional circular nozzle. Three dimensional simulations have been performed to investigate flow quantities in the turbulent Reynold’s Averaged Navier Stokes and Large Eddy Simulation models in a single phase flow. Simulation of a two-phase flow with the Large Eddy Simulation model was also performed to investigate the inception and development of cavitation. The Volume of Fluid approach was used to describe the twophase flow and Rayleigh-Plesset equation to solve bubble dynamics.

40|$|In {{developing}} Asian countries, a major {{recent change}} in irrigation management is the rapid spread of private pumps and wells (modern irrigation systems). This process was accelerated by {{the introduction of}} the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>drilling</b> method in the 1980 s and further by the development of the pump industry in China and India in the 1990 s. The spread of modern systems is associated with the decline in traditional, communally managed irrigation systems. An example of this trend can be found in Tamil Nadu, India. Traditional irrigation systems in this region are tank systems, which consist of a water storage area, sluices, and water supply channels. The water storage area is a small reservoir constructed across the slope of a valley to catch and store water. Water is controlled by the sluices, which are attached to the tank bank and is delivered to paddy fields through channels. This communal infrastructure has been collectively managed by informal local bodies. Although tank systems were the dominant source of irrigation until the early 1960 s, in the last three decades a massive diffusion of private wells and pumps has occurred throughout India, including Tamil Nadu (Figure 1). The dissemination of private wells provides more freedom for users to control irrigation water, in terms of the timing and amount of water delivered to their own fields, compared with collectively maintained tank systems and, thus, those who have access to wells can increase their yield and income (Palanisami 2000). This process has, however, been associated with the degradation of traditional tank systems as there are now less users to maintain them, which could negatively affect the agricultural production of remaining tank users. State statistics have aggregated these positive and negative effects of private wells, and show a net increase in the average yield of rice, a staple crop in the area, and an increase in the average income of farmers (Government of Tamil Nadu) ...|$|E

50|$|In 1895, {{the quarry}} reopened under the {{direction}} of Moses Kellow, a fearless innovator who set about modernising working practices and methods. The two-man teams working in the mill were no longer tied to a two-man team working underground, which enabled the mill to operate more efficiently. Following trials with air drills, he decided instead to electrify the mill, building a large hydro-electric station, which generated three-phase alternating current, rather than the direct current recommended by British manufacturers. He obtained motors from Prague, which were used to drive winches and an electric locomotive, the first to work in Wales. The water wheels were supplemented by Pelton wheels, supplied by Gilbert Gilkes of Kendal. His greatest innovation was the Kellow <b>drill,</b> a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>drill</b> for which he obtained six patents between 1898 and 1915. It could drill a 7.5 ft hole in the slate in under two minutes, much less than the day required using hand drills. The mine was ventilated by a Guibal fan, housed in a fan-house near the entrance to the adit. Peak output under Kellow's direction was between 5,000 and 6,000 tons per year, though it declined in the later years, until the quarry closed in 1930.|$|R

50|$|With {{the design}} complete, {{construction}} {{is the next}} step. Most soil nail wall construction follows a specific procedure. First a cut is excavated and temporary bracing is put in place if necessary. This is done with conventional earth moving equipment and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>drills.</b> Next, holes for the soil nails are drilled at predetermined locations as specified by the design engineer. The equipment used for this step {{is dependent on the}} stability of the material in which the soil nail wall is supporting. Rotary or rotary percussive methods using air flush or dry auger methods can be used with stable ground. For unstable ground, single tube and duplex rotary methods with air and water flush or hollow stem auger methods are used. With the holes drilled, {{the next step is to}} install and grout the nails into place. After all nails are inserted, a drainage system is put into place. Synthetic drainage mat is placed vertically between the nail heads, which are extended down to the base of the wall where they are most commonly connected to a footing drain. A layer of shotcrete is applied and bearing plates are installed before a final facing is put in place to complete the soil nail wall. Variations of the steps described above may be necessary to accommodate additional preparation tasks or supplementary activities for specific project conditions.|$|R
