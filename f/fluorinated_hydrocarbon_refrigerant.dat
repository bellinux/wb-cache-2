40|$|Abstract. Mg {{especially}} in the molten state {{is well known for}} its high affinity to O 2. When O 2 content of the atmosphere is larger than 4 %, molten Mg will burn! To avoid this, melt protection is necessary. At present mostly SF 6 is used during primary production and processing of Mg and its alloys. Unfortunately SF 6 is a very potent greenhouse gas that is> 23, 000 times more effective than CO 2. This also affects life cycle considerations e. g. for the use of Mg alloys in transportation. However, other protective gases like SO 2 or <b>fluorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> like HFC 134 a, Novec 612, or AMCover (=HFC 134 a) have been suggested to replace SF 6.
