5|$|Devotional art {{before the}} Reformation {{included}} books and images commissioned in the Netherlands. Before the Reformation in the mid-sixteenth century the <b>interiors</b> <b>of</b> Scottish churches were often elaborate and colourful, with sacrament houses and monumental effigies. Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll {{as a result}} of Reformation iconoclasm, with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings.|$|E

All sets for the <b>interiors</b> <b>of</b> the building were designed and built from scratch at Pinewood Studios.

5|$|The Flood's {{design and}} fiction was spearheaded by Bungie artist Robert McLees, who {{utilized}} unused concepts {{from the earlier}} Bungie game Marathon 2. The ringworld Halo was stripped of many of its large creatures to make the Flood's appearance more startling. Bungie environment artist Vic DeLeon spent six months of pre-production time refining the Flood's fleshy aesthetic and designing the organic <b>interiors</b> <b>of</b> Flood-infested space ships for Halo3.|$|E

5|$|According {{to current}} {{physical}} cosmology theory, carbon is {{formed in the}} <b>interiors</b> <b>of</b> stars in the horizontal branch by the collision and transformation of three helium nuclei. When those stars die as supernova, the carbon is scattered into space as dust.

The Solar System is one such star system with an abundance of carbon, enabling the existence of life as we know it.|$|E
5|$|Before filming, Mendes {{sought to}} produce a period film that would avoid clichés in the gangster genre. He chose to film Road to Perdition on {{location}} in downtown at the University Club of Chicago, the Chicago neighborhood of Pullman {{as well as the}} Chicago suburb of Geneva, Illinois. The Armory, the state's largest location mainstay which houses the Illinois State National Guard, was provided to the studio by the Illinois State Film Commission. Sets were built inside the Armory, including <b>interiors</b> <b>of</b> the Sullivan family's home and the Rooney mansion. The availability of an inside location provided the crew complete control over the lighting environment, which was established with the rigging of scaffoldings.|$|E

5|$|Douglas {{designed}} some 500 buildings. He {{built at}} least 40new churches or chapels, restored, altered or made additions {{to many other}} churches, and designed fittings and furniture for the <b>interiors</b> <b>of</b> churches. He designed new houses, altered or made additions to others, and built various structures associated with those houses. Douglas's works also included farms, shops, offices, hotels, a hospital, drinking fountains, clocks, schools, public baths, a library, a bridge, an obelisk, cheese factories, and public conveniences. As his office was in Chester, most of his works were in Cheshire and North Wales, although some were further afield, in Lancashire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Important {{theoretical}} work on {{the physical}} structure of stars occurred during {{the first decades of}} the twentieth century. In 1913, the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram was developed, propelling the astrophysical study of stars. Successful models were developed to explain the <b>interiors</b> <b>of</b> stars and stellar evolution. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin first proposed that stars were made primarily of hydrogen and helium in her 1925 PhD thesis. The spectra of stars were further understood through advances in quantum physics. This allowed the chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere to be determined.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifteenth}} century {{continental}} builders {{are known to have}} been working in Scotland. French master-mason John Morrow was employed at the building of Glasgow Cathedral and the rebuilding of Melrose Abbey, both considered fine examples of Gothic architecture. Compared with after the Reformation, the <b>interiors</b> <b>of</b> churches were often elaborate, with highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell. The carvings at Rosslyn Chapel, depicting the progression of the seven deadly sins, were created in the mid-fifteenth century. They are considered some of the finest in the Gothic style. Late Medieval Scottish churches also often contained elaborate burial monuments, like the Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas.|$|E

5|$|Natural ice {{was put to}} many uses. The ice trade enabled its {{widespread}} use in medicine in attempts to treat diseases and to alleviate their symptoms, as well as making tropical hospitals more bearable. In Calcutta, for example, part of each ice shipment was specially reserved in the city's ice house {{for the use of}} the local doctors. By the middle of the 19th century, the British Royal Navy was using imported ice to cool the <b>interiors</b> <b>of</b> its ships' gun turrets. In 1864, and after several attempts, salmon eggs were finally shipped successfully from Britain to Australia, using natural ice to keep them chilled on route, enabling the creation of the Tasmanian salmon fishery industry.|$|E
5|$|Nickel is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal {{with a slight}} golden tinge. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. Pure nickel, powdered to maximize the reactive surface area, shows a significant chemical activity, but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms {{on the surface and}} prevents further corrosion (passivation). Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the <b>interiors</b> <b>of</b> larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Temple {{construction}} {{did not end}} {{once the}} original plan was complete; pharaohs often rebuilt or replaced decayed temple structures or made additions to those still standing. In the course of these additions, they frequently dismantled old temple buildings to use as fill for the <b>interiors</b> <b>of</b> new structures. On rare occasions {{this may have been}} because the old structures or their builders had become anathema, as with Akhenaten's temples, but in most cases the reason seems to have been convenience. Such expansion and dismantling could considerably distort the original temple plan, as happened at the enormous Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak, which developed two intersecting axes and several satellite temples.|$|E

5|$|The crew {{moved to}} a small island in the Bahamas called White Cay for the {{beginning}} and end of the Isla Cruces battle, before production took a break until August, where in Los Angeles the <b>interiors</b> <b>of</b> the Flying Dutchman were shot. On September 18, 2005, the crew moved to Grand Bahama Island to shoot ship exteriors, including the working Black Pearl and Flying Dutchman. Filming there was a tumultuous period, starting with the fact that the tank had not actually been finished. The hurricane season caused many pauses in shooting, and Hurricane Wilma damaged many of the accessways and pumps, though no one was hurt nor were any of the ships destroyed. Filming completed on September 10, 2005.|$|E
5|$|The faux {{finished}} {{interior of}} the church incorporates groined vaults in the Gothic architecture style permitting very ample illumination from lateral windows. The steel columns, walls and ceiling were painted by Lorenzo Rocha, Isabelo Tampingco and Félix Martínez to {{give the appearance of}} marble and jasper. Trompe l'oeil paintings of saints and martyrs by Rocha were used to decorate the <b>interiors</b> <b>of</b> the church. True to the Gothic revival spirit of the church are its confessionals, pulpit, altars and five retablos designed by Lorenzo Guerrero and Rocha. The sculptor Eusebio Garcia carved the statues of holy men and women. Six holy water fonts were constructed for the church, each crafted from marble obtained from Romblon.|$|E
5|$|The <b>interiors</b> <b>of</b> each wing have {{separate}} uses. In {{the west wing}} is the baptistry, in the north is the main altar, the main entrance and a notary area, separated by inside corner walls made of chiluca stone and tezontle. Chiluca, a white stone, covers the walls and floors and the tezontle frames the doors and windows. At the crossing of the structure is an octagonal dome framed by arches that form curved triangles where they meet {{at the top of}} the dome. The principal altar is in the ornate Churrigueresque style and crafted by indigenous artist Pedro Patiño Ixtolinque. It was inaugurated in 1829.|$|E
