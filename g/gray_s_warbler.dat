40|$|This fall 2000 {{season was}} marked by a very {{westerly}} flavor to the passerine migration with many sightings of western warblers, vireos, and flycatchers in western Nebraska. Most notably, Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers and Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Vireos were seen in good numbers. Additionally, three sightings of Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> and five of Dusky Flycatcher added to the excitement. In this note, we report this fall 2 ̆ 7 s sightings of Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> and comment {{on the status of}} this species in Nebraska. On 26 August 2000, Dinsmore observed a Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Vermivora virginiae) along the north side of Oliver Reservoir. He studied the bird at close range from 9 : 52 - 10 : 05 a. m. as it foraged with a large flock of migrant passerines. The identification of the bird as a Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> was straightforward. Features noted included the generally dull gray/brown plumage, slightly paler underparts with a very dull yellowish or buff patch {{at the center of the}} breast and bright yellow undertail coverts, conspicuous white eyering. plain, unmarked wings, and the nearly constant sideways flicking of the tail. On the basis of the brown tones to the plumage, dusky underparts, lack of a rufous cap, and only a faint hint of a yellow/buff breast patch, he concluded that the bird was an immature female Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> (see Dunn and Garrett 1997). Fontaine saw this individual briefly on 27 August in the same general area. On 27 August 2000, Fontaine observed a Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> along the gravel road South of exit 1 off Interstate 80 in southwestern Kimball County. The bird was seen shortly after sunrise from 6 : 45 - 6 : 50 a. m. foraging in a stand of Limber Pine approximately 15 meters from the roadside. The Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> was in the company of a loose flock of migrants composed of Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers, Blue-gray Gnatcatchers, and a Brown Thrasher. The bird was seen flicking its tail as it moved from tree to tree. Based on the clean gray breast and bold lemon yellow undertail coverts, he concluded the bird was an adult female...|$|R

40|$|MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Oporornis tolmiei) is {{considered}} by Johnsgard (1980) to be a rare spring and fall migrant in western Nebraska. with most records from the Panhandle. but reported from as far east as Platte Co. Bray et al (1986) consider it regular and cite a specimen taken in Boone Co [...] Whatever the status. this warbler is infrequently encountered in Nebraska. and separating this species from Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia) can often be difficult. Some authorities believe the two to be conspecific, although Hall (1979) found very few hybrid specimens and Salt (1973) found {{that they did not}} respond to the playback of each other 2 ̆ 7 s song in the suggested overlap zone in Alberta (Roberson 1980). It is the authors 2 ̆ 7 opinion that for any record of a MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> in central and eastern Nebraska to be entirely convincing the bird should have in-hand data taken on it or extremely well documentation of multiple field marks, which must include tail length in reference to the body. Reasons are as follows: MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers are characterized by having a broken eyering, although both male and female, adult and immature, Mouring Warblers may have incomplete eyerings (Wood and Beimborm 1981); while MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 s have black lores and most Mournings have gray lores, some populations of Mourning Warblers are black lored (Robertson 1980). The above mentioned characteristics are not fully explained in any of the major field guides, although they do state that separation and field identification of immatures of these species is often very difficult or next to impossible...|$|R

Joel has decided to spend his limited free time on Records Committee matters; he is {{currently}} Chairman. Over the last few years, Joel has made significant contributions to Nebraska ornithology, particularly through his! meticulous counts of shorebirds in the Rainwater Basin. This season proved interesting in terms of ranges of breeding birds, as discussed in the accounts. See, for example, Little Blue Heron, the dOWitchers. Black-billed Magpie, White-breasted Nuthatch, Sedge Wren, and the towhees. There seems to be an increasing number of 2 ̆ 2 displaced 2 ̆ 2 birds, either early or late 2 ̆ 7 migrants or birds just in the wrong places. Could this situation result from an increasingly unstable atmosphere? Very late in spring were Hudsonian Godwit and Wilson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler,</b> while very early in fall were Willet, Semipalmated Sandpiper. and Orange-crowned Warbler. Birds in the wrong places were numerous, but significant were a 2 ̆ 2 small race 2 ̆ 2 Canada Goose, ducks such as American Wigeon. Green-winged Teal, Bufflehead, and Common Goldeneye, Mississippi Kite away from Ogallala, adult Golden Eagle eastward, adult American Golden-Plover in July. westerly Least Terns, northerly Acadian Flycatcher, singing mid-June Blue-winged Warblers, Yellow-breasted Chats in Harlan Co, and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow in the RWB.

40|$|Although {{the impacts}} of {{livestock}} and human activities on riparian zones and associated wildlife have been well documented, {{little is known about}} the impacts that browsing by large native ungulates such as elk and moose may have. In the northern Yellowstone area, some willow stands experience intense browsing by elk and moose whereas others experience medium or very low amounts of browsing. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare the species and densities of birds among willow stands that have experienced different intensities of browsing by native ungulates, (2) to measure the relationship between five species of birds and aspects of habitat structure, and (3) to develop and evaluate predictive models that relate presence or absence of the five species to habitat characteristics. In 1989 and 1990, I measured densities of nesting songbirds and aspects of habitat structure in eight large willow stands that have experienced different intensities of browsing. The densities of five focal species (Common Yellowthroat, Lincoln 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Sparrow, <b>Warbling</b> Vireo, Wilson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler,</b> and Yellow Warbler) varied considerably among sites. Only two sites had all five species and only one species [...] the Lincoln 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow 2 ̆ 7 was found in all eight sites. The proportion of severely browsed willows in the eight sites ranged from 3. 5...|$|R
