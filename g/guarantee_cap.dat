We show that peers' selfish behavior leads to an equilibrium that is suboptimal in terms of social welfare, because selfish peers are interested in forming clusters and exchanging data among themselves. In order to increase the social welfare we propose a novel incentive mechanism, Server <b>Guaranteed</b> <b>Cap</b> (SGC), that uses the server capacity as an incentive for high contributing peers to upload to low contributing ones. We prove that SGC is individually rational and incentive compatible. We also show that under very general conditions, there exists exactly one server capacity allocation that maximizes the social welfare under SGC, hence simple gradient based method can be used to find the optimal allocation...|$|R

The focus is in particular on how the introduction of minimum and maximum limits for pension benefits as well as minimum <b>guarantees</b> and <b>caps</b> on the return of the members' individual investment accounts affect the investment decision. The study finds that portfolio choice of sponsor and beneficaries shows substantial differences depending on the exact plan design and the beneficaries' risk aversion. The introduction of caps on investment returns emerged a possible means to reduce such differences and to share investment risks and returns more equally between sponsor and beneficaries...|$|R

40|$|During recent decades, {{the variety}} of {{financial}} products has continuously grown. Besides the number of financial products, their complexity has also increased. Owing to this development, an investor has to choose between many different investment opportunities. The focus of this thesis is to analyze different sources of suboptimality of financial retail products and their influence on the investor’s utility. Therefore, we assume an expected constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility maximizing investor under the assumptions of the Black and Scholes model where the optimal payoff profile is given by a Constant-Mix strategy. Based upon {{the assumption that the}} financial market is only complete for the issuer of retail products, we determine suboptimal retail products from the investor's perspective, since she can only choose one of the offered products. In general, the corresponding payoff profiles differ from the overall optimal product. The main Chapter (Chapter 3) focuses on structured stylized products where the payoff granted to the investor depends on the performance of an underlying asset. Such products often contain a <b>guarantee,</b> a <b>cap</b> or even a path-dependent payoff feature. Thus, this part of the thesis analyzes, quantifies and compares the suboptimality which is introduced by different payoff features of structured stylized products. In Chapters 4 and 5, two existing classes of structured stylized products (Best Garant Certificates and Locally Capped Garant Certificates) are considered. Beside the analysis of suboptimality, the focus is on fair product design and on the return rate distribution. Chapter 6 refers to the analysis of the Best Garant Certificates and takes into account default risk which means that the issuer of the certificate can become insolvent before maturity. In Chapter 7 we consider the optimal product design of products with <b>guarantees</b> and <b>caps</b> from the both investor’s and the issuer’s perspective, allowing an embedded margin...|$|R

When PPPs are desirable because {{the private sector}} is more efficient, the contract that optimally trades demand risk, user-fee distortions and the opportunity cost of public funds is characterized by a minimum revenue <b>guarantee</b> and a <b>cap</b> on the firm’s revenues. Yet income guarantees and revenue sharing arrangements observed in practice differ fundamentally from those suggested by the optimal contract. The optimal contract can be implemented via a competitive auction with realistic informational requirements; and risk allocation under the optimal contract suggests that PPPs are closer to public provision than to privatization.

40|$|Bail-ins {{could prove}} an {{effective}} way to replace the unpopular bail-outs. In the EU the doom-loop between bank and sovereign indebtedness left governments with a major conundrum. Thus, the EU resolution regime requires the prior participation of bank creditors in meeting the costs of bank recapitalisation before any form of public contribution is made. But, there is a danger of over-reliance on bail-ins. Bail-in regimes will not remove the need for public injection of funds, unless the risk is idiosyncratic. This suggestion raises concerns for banks in the periphery of the euro-area, which present very high levels of non-performing assets, crippling credit growth and economic recovery. To avoid pushing Eurozone banks with high NPL levels into bail-in centred recapitalisations, we have considered the benefits from and legal obstacles to the possible establishment of a euro-wide fund for NPLs that would enjoy an ESM <b>guarantee.</b> Long-term (<b>capped)</b> profit-loss sharing arrangements could bring the operation of the fund as close to a commercial operation as possible. Cleaning up bank balance sheets from NPLs would free up capital for new lending boosting economic recovery in the periphery of the Eurozone...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine equity-linked life {{insurance}} contracts in a stochastic interest rate economy via quantile hedging whose {{purpose is to}} look for the optimal probability of a successful hedge under initial budget constraint. Most of the existing studies have focused on valuing equity-linked life insurance contracts by quantile hedging or in a framework of stochastic interest rates. However, a few have taken into account simultaneously the two techniques, which make valuing equity-linked life insurance contracts more difficult. We model the term structure of interest rates by classical HJM model that imbeds stochastic interest rate economy into one containing an arbitrary number of additional risky assets. By means of the change of measure approach, we give explicit formulas for the fair values of the following four products: deterministic payoff contract, pure equity-linked life contract, equity-linked life contract with guarantee, equity-linked life contract with minimum <b>guarantees</b> and <b>capped</b> benefits. We find that the explicit formulas are mainly composed of normal distribution functions and two-dimensional normal distribution functions. We also investigate sensibility of the survival probability using data of interest rates, stock prices and life table from China.

40|$|The {{participation}} of private capital in public infrastructure investment projects {{has been sought}} by many governments who perceive this {{as a way to}} overcome budgetary constraints and foster economic growth. For some types of projects, this investment may require government participation in the form of project guarantees {{in order to reduce the}} risk to the private investor, and as a consequence, the government assumes a contingent liability which may have significant future budgetary impacts. We present a minimum traffic guarantee (MTG) real options model that differs from most of the literature in the field by using market data to determine stochastic project parameters. This model can be used to assess the value of these guarantees, allows the government to analyse the cost-benefit of each level of support, and proposes an alternative to limit the exposure of the government while still maintaining the benefits to the private investor. We apply this model to the projected 1000 mile long BR- 163 toll road that will link the Brazilian Midwest to the Amazon River. We conclude that the use of public-private partnerships (PPP) with <b>guarantees</b> and <b>caps</b> on total government outlays can be modelled effectively using option pricing methods and can be a solution to attract private investment to high risk public infrastructure projects.

To account for counterparty risk and funding issues, we use the calibrated multiple-curve model as an underlying model for CVA computation.

Data elements have keys (cookies, users, queries) and elements with different keys interleave. Analytics on such data typically utilizes statistics stated {{in terms of}} the frequencies of keys. The two most common statistics are distinct, which is the number of active keys in a specified segment, and sum, which is the sum of the frequencies of keys in the segment. Both are special cases of cap statistics, defined as the sum of frequencies capped by a parameter T, which are popular in online advertising platforms. Aggregation by key, however, is costly, requiring state proportional to the number of distinct keys, and therefore we are interested in estimating these statistics or more generally, sampling the data, without aggregation. We present a sampling framework for unaggregated data that uses a single pass (for streams) or two passes (for distributed data) and state proportional to the desired sample size. Our design provides the first effective solution for general frequency cap statistics. Our ℓ-capped samples provide estimates with tight statistical <b>guarantees</b> for <b>cap</b> statistics with T=Θ(ℓ) and nonnegative unbiased estimates of any monotone non-decreasing frequency statistics. An added benefit of our unified design is facilitating multi-objective samples, which provide estimates with statistical guarantees for a specified set of different statistics, using a single, smaller sample.

40|$|The {{long term}} {{regulation}} of the EU agrarian sector via the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and its respective instruments focuses on the sustainable development both of the agriculture and rural area as a whole. It is needed above all to stress out the equalization instruments of CAP {{within the context of}} negative impacts diminish of outer sectorial environment in relation with the economic status of agricultural businesses, specifically the small and medium ones. The EU programming period of years 2014 - 2020 is focused from the view point of the agrarian sector on more efficient CAP to encourage the competitiveness of European farmers. The aforementioned programming period is for agricultural producers from V 4 countries the first one when <b>CAP</b> <b>guarantees</b> the maximum amount of operational subsidies for them, of course regarding the respective agreed EU accession treaties. Nevertheless, CAP subsidies cannot be considered to be the key factor of competitiveness within EU single market. The relation between long term increasing of productions inputs on one hand and the decreasing of agricultural producers prices on the other one can be marked as very important negative aspect within the need of farmers sustainable competitiveness. So, the direct consequence of a negative influence of aforementioned factor is the subsequent negative direct influence on profitability of agricultural producers. The need for increasing the efficiency of production, marketing and other related processing activities appears to be relevant and inevitable.

40|$|To make {{a summary}} of a book that {{contains}} so many different threads is no easy task. One should, on the one hand, refer to its conceptual contribution to the paradigm of sustainable agriculture, {{and on the other}} hand, consider the conclusions drawn from the studies conducted at international, national and regional level. It is clear that changing the paradigm of agricultural development from an industrial to a sustainable one will be neither easy nor quick. Agriculture must satisfy the demand for food products while lowering the pressure on the environment, providing for technological and biological progress, meeting the need to ensure a secure supply of food, and ensuring global economic, social and environmental rationality. The discussion in this book has concentrated chiefly on the last two questions. This is because certain dimensions of environmental and social rationality have so far been poorly researched. Environmental rationality means not only protecting the natural environment and reducing the pressure placed on it by agricultural production. The authors have pointed out that the assumption of an intrinsic value of land changes the expected productivity of capital in the sectors which utilise that production factor, namely in agriculture. This has far-reaching theoretical and practical consequences. The statistical data that have been presented demonstrate that utilities are discounted in Polish land prices to a much greater degree than would result from the agricultural functions of land. A similar situation is found in other EU countries. Where does this excess value of land come from? It is undoubtedly a result of the expectations of political rents, of speculative motives, and also of non-agricultural amenities provided by land. However, it is hard to determine the proportions of these factors. Moreover, new utilities of land have the nature of public goods, which further complicates the problem of seeking a market equilibrium. Similarly, recognition of the fact of the absolute and relative deprivation of farmers in the long term changes the balance of intersectoral flows, because it means a drainage of surplus from agriculture to other branches of agribusiness. This drainage is understood as a permanent mechanism by which economic rent flows out of agriculture as a result of market imperfections, in particular the flexible prices of agricultural products. More space should be given to studies of this problem in the world literature. 135 Poznan University of Economics and Business, anna. matuszczak@ue. poznan. pl Summary: Political Rents and the European Model of Agriculture 239 The second thread of the theoretical considerations relates to the problem of whether the concept of political rent, as found in the literature, fits the processes taking place in European agriculture. A review of the literature on rent seeking suggests that these theories provide only a partial explanation of the level of political rents and lobbying actions in European agriculture. Although there is a vast theoretical literature on rent seeking and collective action at global level, there is not much empirical work done with regard to these problems relating to the Common Agricultural Policy. Particularly problematic is the question of measuring political rents in particular EU member states. It has been found that, on a global level, it is European agriculture that best meets the criteria of viability and sustainability. Viewed against the backdrop of global agriculture, it is economically effective (in the institutional conditions <b>guaranteed</b> by the <b>CAP),</b> satisfies a variety of economic and social needs, and is developing in a way that reduces the burden on the environment. In 2012, {{based on the results of}} social consultations, the European Commission published a strategy and plan of action relating to the bioeconomy in Europe. The strategy creates a cohesive framework for a comprehensive approach to the solution of complex social problems (challenges) in Europe and worldwide. The measures undertaken with respect to the bioeconomy are focused on three pillars: investment in research, innovations and skills; strengthening the impact of the policy and engagement of interested parties; and strengthening competitiveness in sectors of the bioeconomy. The bioeconomy strategy represents an important step towards solving contemporary economic and social problems. The model of the development of agriculture in the EU can thus be considered an appropriate path to be followed in relatively densely populated countries, in which food producing area per capita is small. However, does this model require institutional support and the payment of political rents? The question arises as to whether these are in fact political rents, if in return society receives a package of specified benefits, and there is a net increase in social well-being. Empirical analyses have shown that up to the mid 1980 s the level of support for agriculture in the EU (measured by the NRA indicator) was constantly increasing. The decline in support in subsequent years was maintained by payments of the decoupled type. Based on NRA values it can be concluded that nominal support in 2011 was at a level comparable to that recorded prior to the creation of an organisation of agricultural markets, that is, before 1962. This means that the CAP is distorting world prices to an ever smaller degree, and agricultural producers are losing their competitive advantages (although to differing extents). An important observation is the fact that, although the CAP applies to all member states, the level of support varies between those countries. In 2005 - 2011 it was the highest in Ireland, Slovenia, Poland, Belgium and the UK, and the lowest in Italy and Bulgaria. This observation 240 Summary: Political Rents and the European Model of Agriculture is confirmed by a second indicator constructed for the purposes of this research by the authors of Chapter 2. 3 – the Farm Receipts Gap Estimate (FRGE). Despite the fact that in principle agricultural policy has a universal application, the amount of financial support given to agricultural producers measured as a percentage of gross farm receipts is not uniform between countries, with differences as high as 17 percentage points in 2012136 (cf. Table 2. 4.). We should add that, according to the OECD, the value of the PSE for the whole of the European Union is 22. 6...|$|R
