5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are also}} {{important}} in metabolic control. Many metabolic pathways in the cell are inhibited by metabolites that control enzyme activity through allosteric regulation or substrate inhibition. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the allosteric regulation of the glycolytic pathway. This catabolic pathway consumes glucose and produces ATP, NADH and pyruvate. A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1). When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an allosteric site in PFK1 to decrease {{the rate of the}} enzyme reaction; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls. This negative feedback control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP in the cell. However, metabolic pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important. With respect to PFK1, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and ADP are examples of metabolites that are allosteric activators.|$|E
25|$|Differences in {{interpretation}} {{stemming from the}} same Hebrew text. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> Genesis 4.7, shown above.|$|E
25|$|Abaisé ("lowered") is {{when the}} eagle is shown affronté (facing the viewer) and the wings are shown with the tips downward. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the eagle on the reverse side of the US quarter dollar coin.|$|E
5000|$|Ontologic growth {{changes as}} the animal reaches adulthood. <b>Good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> the flaring {{lip of the}} adult conch and the inward-coiled lip of the cowry.|$|R
50|$|Many {{species of}} this group are among the best-known {{ornamental}} plants in the gardens or in pots. Some <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> Freesia, Ixia, Crocosmia, Gladiolus and other popular flowers.|$|R
50|$|Berbers {{have reached}} high {{positions}} in the social hierarchy across the Maghreb; <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> {{the former president of}} Algeria, Liamine Zeroual, and the former prime minister of Morocco, Driss Jettou.|$|R
25|$|The Trent valley also links {{together}} other SSSI {{and local}} nature reserves, which have varying habitats {{not only for}} birds, but also mammals, insects and fish, a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the tributary River Mease where the entire watercourse has been designated both as a SSSI and a European special area of conservation.|$|E
25|$|Body and shinai {{will lose}} balance as you strike or when being attacked. This {{technique}} {{takes advantage of}} this to help execute a strike. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> Hikibana-kote, when a strike is made to an opponent's kote as they feel threatened and raise their kensen as you push forward.|$|E
25|$|Some gate-towers {{were also}} open-backed. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the Böhmertor at Freistadt in Upper Austria. Here {{three levels of}} gun embrasures or {{openings}} can be seen, with those at the corner angled to cover the moat. The vertical slits for the drawbridge over the moat can also be seen.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe usual {{information}} in inductive inference {{available for the}} purposes of identifying an unknown recursive function f is the set of all input/output examples (x,f(x)),n εN. In contrast to this approach we show that it is considerably more powerful to work with finite sets of “good” examples even when these <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> required to be effectively computable. The influence of the underlying numberings, with respect to which the identification has to be realized, to the capabilities of inference from <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>is</b> also investigated. It turns out that nonstandard numberings can be much more powerful than Gödel numberings...|$|R
30|$|Electron {{microscopy}} {{has been}} used to search for some hidden particles in solids, which are key particles in the formation of novel hierarchical morphologies. <b>Good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> twin-crystals of ZnO and flower-like BiOBr.|$|R
25|$|<b>Good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> {{coordination}} complexes of d- or f-metals or proteins {{with such}} centers, e.g. myoglobin. In such materials the organic {{part of the}} molecule acts as an envelope shielding the spins from their neighbors.|$|R
25|$|On a more {{domestic}} scale, {{the suburbs}} of cities like Dunedin and Wellington spread out with modest, but handsome suburban villas with Italianate details such as low-pitched roofs, tall windows, corner quoins, and stone detailing, all rendered in wood. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> {{the birthplace of the}} writer Katherine Mansfield.|$|E
25|$|Enantioselective oxidations are {{typically}} either kinetic resolutions of chiral alcohols or desymmetrization reactions. These oxidations may be facilitated {{through the use}} of chiral nitroxide radicals in the catalytic mode. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> provided by the kinetic resolution of racemic 1-phenylethanol. Oxidative desymmetrization processes employing oxoammonium oxidants, on the other hand, are relatively rare.|$|E
25|$|The {{underground}} {{scenes of}} various genres are very lively in Finland {{at the moment}} {{and a lot of}} bands and artists defy the genre-limits. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> very popular Finnish underground rap artist ASA (formerly known as MC Avain), who has used folk-artists as the accompanying band. Of bands such as Profeetta ja UMU {{it is very hard to}} say, what genre they represent.|$|E
50|$|Also {{noticeable}} is {{a pronounced}} increase in autokinetic sediments like turbidites, debris flows, slides etc. {{at or near}} the turning point. <b>Good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> the limestones of the Barmstein, the Sonnwendbreccia, the Tauglboden Formation and the Strubberg Formation.|$|R
5000|$|Puerto Ricans {{also often}} shorten words by {{eliminating}} whole syllables. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>are</b> the words para, madre, and padre ("for", [...] "mother", and [...] "father"): Puerto Ricans may pronounce para as , madre as , and padre as [...]|$|R
50|$|Abstract model theory {{provides}} {{an approach that}} allows us to step back and study a wide range of logics and their relationships. The starting point for the study of abstract models, which resulted in <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>was</b> Lindström's theorem.|$|R
25|$|Nashi temples are {{decorated}} {{on the interior}} with carvings on poles, arches and wall paintings that often exhibit a unique combination of dongba and Buddhist influences. The decorations include depictions of episodes from epics, dancers, warriors, animals and birds, and flowers. The mural paintings depict Dongba gods, and stylistically are derived from Han Chinese interpretations of Tibetan Buddhist themes. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the Delwada Temple.|$|E
25|$|While {{the plant}} hosts exhibit low specificity, EcM fungi exhibit {{various levels of}} specificity, and the costs and {{benefits}} to their specialization are not well understood. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the suilloid group, a monophyletic assemblage containing the genera Suillus, Rhizopogon, Gomphidius and others. This is the largest group that exhibits such an extreme degree of specificity, with almost all of its members forming ectomycorrhizas with members of the Pinaceae. However, many other fungal groups exhibit a very broad host-range more akin to host lineages.|$|E
25|$|A general {{technique}} {{to improve performance}} is to avoid work. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> {{the use of a}} fast path for common cases, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary work. For example, using a simple text layout algorithm for Latin text, only switching to a complex layout algorithm for complex scripts, such as Devanagari. Another important technique is caching, particularly memoization, which avoids redundant computations. Because of the importance of caching, there are often many levels of caching in a system, which can cause problems from memory use, and correctness issues from stale caches.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} Angkorian temples {{were made}} mainly of brick. <b>Good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> the temple towers of Preah Ko, Lolei and Bakong at Hariharalaya. Decorations were usually carved into a stucco {{applied to the}} brick, rather than into the brick itself.|$|R
50|$|Some have L-shaped porches {{to protect}} against wind and rain; some {{particularly}} <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> to be found at Grimspound. It is believed {{that they would have}} had a conical roof, supported by timbers and covered in turf or thatch.|$|R
5000|$|At other times, Horne's {{character}} would pretend not {{to understand}} the more risqué meanings in Julian and Sandy's dialogue, although it was always hinted that he was secretly in on the joke. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>was</b> Horne attempting to use Polari himself: ...|$|R
25|$|Interlingua has no {{explicitly}} defined phonotactics. However, the prototyping procedure for determining Interlingua words, which strives for internationality, should in general lead naturally to {{words that are}} easy for most learners to pronounce. In the process of forming new words, an ending cannot always be added without a modification of some kind in between. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the plural -s, which is always preceded by a vowel {{to prevent the occurrence}} of a hard-to-pronounce consonant cluster at the end. If the singular does not end in a vowel, the final -s becomes -es.|$|E
25|$|Shore {{also uses}} his themes subtly to inform {{dramatic}} connections, rather than serve strictly as a musical stand-in for characters. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> how Shore forms the first {{notes of the}} fellowship theme over Sam joining Frodo, and expanding on it when Merry, Pippin and Strider join the group to hint at the gradual coming together of the Fellowship of the Ring and {{leading up to the}} full statement in the council of Elrond. There is even significance as to the order in which themes appear in a scene or to when a theme is absent.|$|E
25|$|The {{spread of}} {{prostitution}} practices {{has introduced a}} large quantity of slang to the popular vocabulary. Prostitution is a popular subject in the media, especially on the internet. Typically news of police raids, court cases or family tragedies related to prostitution are published in a sensationalised form. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> news of an orgy between 400 Japanese clients and 500 Chinese prostitutes in 2003, which partially because of anti-Japanese sentiment, was widely publicised and met with considerable outrage. Another highly publicised case was that of Alex Ho Wai-to, then a Democratic Party candidate for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, who was given a six-month re-education through labor sentence for hiring a prostitute.|$|E
50|$|Classical:A type {{of theater}} which relies upon {{imagination}} (and therefore limited props) {{to convey the}} setting and atmosphere of the play. Classical theatre usually contains lofty, grand prose or free verse dialogue. <b>Good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> the Elizabethan dramatists such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the schools}} are still in use as schools, some have other uses, and some have <b>been</b> demolished. <b>Good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> the Icknield Street School near the Hockley Flyover, north of the Jewellery Quarter, and Oozells Street Board School, now the Ikon Gallery.|$|R
50|$|The 19th {{century was}} also a period of active {{building}} of new churches, the Uspenski Cathedral being {{the most important of}} them. The garrisons needed Orthodox churches and so did the new emigrants to the towns. A <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> the Orthodox church of Tampere and Turku.|$|R
25|$|The {{principal}} Buddhist guardian deities {{are frequently}} {{indicated by the}} animal vehicles of the particular gods, particularity on the guard stones. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> furnished by the exquisite statues {{on either side of}} the entrance to Abhayagiri Stupa. The head‑dress of one of the statues is a conch while that of the other is a lotus. Representing Sanka and Padma, the two principal treasure houses of Kuvera, they are believed to have been erected to ward off any evil or danger that might threaten the stupa or its precinct. Even at present they are commonly believed to be endowed with mystic powers, and courts of law in Anuradhapura accept swearing before the statues as evidence in settlement of minor disputes between litigants.|$|E
25|$|In modern layman usage {{the term}} is {{restricted}} to the displacement of the third only and the dissonant second or fourth no longer needs to be held over (prepared) from the previous chord. Neither is it now obligatory for the displaced note to make an appearance at all though {{in the majority of}} cases the conventional stepwise resolution to the third is still observed. In post-bop and modal jazz compositions and improvisations suspended seventh chords are often used in nontraditional ways: these often do not function as V chords, and do not resolve from the fourth to the third. The lack of resolution gives the chord an ambiguous, static quality. Indeed, the third is often played on top of a sus4 chord. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the jazz standard, Maiden Voyage.|$|E
25|$|Magnates of the Commonwealth {{are often}} called the {{aristocracy}} of the Commonwealth but the definition of what constitutes aristocracy differs {{from the rest of}} Europe in that the Magnate families were much more powerful, often comparable to Princes. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the extinct family of Pac that ruled the Duchy of Lithuania in the 17th century. The Pac family had not descended from a Prince, and therefore did not use any title at all. During the partition of the Commonwealth the Pac family received the title of Count. However, when looking at the size of the Pac properties and their position in the Commonwealth, a simple Count title seems not adequate to their power and property size that was far beyond imagination of most of the European Lords.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} the concepts of IFP-intuitionistic fuzzy soft h-ideals and IFP-equivalent intuitionistic fuzzy soft h-ideals of hemirings. Some characterizations and properties of them are given. In particular, some <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> explored. Finally, we investigate aggregate intuitionistic fuzzy h-ideals of hemirings based on decision making...|$|R

50|$|But {{the ideal}} target {{is to find}} subtypes of the disease that respond better to a {{specific}} treatment. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> could <b>be</b> the discovery {{that the presence of}} a gene called SLC9A9 appears in people who fail to respond to interferon β therapy or that the disregulation of some transcription factors define molecular subtypes of the disease Other <b>good</b> <b>example</b> could <b>be</b> the Hellberg-Eklund score for predicting the response to Natalizumab.|$|R
