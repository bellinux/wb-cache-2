50|$|Specific {{studies of}} {{the fish in the}} Titarisios river have not been done, but 37 species of fish have been reported, and another 11 species are presumed present. Due to its {{connection}} to sea via the Pineios, the Titarisios also contains migratory fish like the Acipenser sturio (European sea sturgeon) and Alosa fallax (twait shad). Also the Nemacheilus barbatulus (stone loach) and the Sabanejewia aurata balcanica (<b>golden</b> <b>loach)</b> have been found.|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: In June 2005 the Balkan <b>golden</b> <b>loach</b> Sabanejewia balcanica (Karaman, 1922) {{was found}} {{for the first time}} in Montenegro in the Lim river. Materials and Methods: Nine {{specimens}} were measured morphometrically and meristically. Seventeen morphometric characters were measured to the nearest 0. 1 mmwith callipers and four meristic characters were counted. Results: The habitats in which these specimens have been found belong to the barbell zone with clear water and gravel bottom (large stones, gravel and sand), and rarely below the roots of woody plants. In this locality, beside Balkan <b>golden</b> <b>loach,</b> 9 more species were found. Conclusions: This study is a contribution to dispersion and more detailed knowledge of morphological characteristics of Balkan <b>golden</b> <b>loach...</b>|$|E

40|$|Monitoring on 45 localities on {{territory}} of the Czech Republic was realized in 2014. Observed were occurence and frequency of selected group of endangered fish species: Ukrainian brook lamprey (Eudontomyzon mariae), streber (Zingel streber), zingel (Zingel zingel), gudgeon (Romanogobio sp.), Danube ruffe (Gymnocephalus baloni), striped ruffe (Gymnocephalus schraetser), ziege (Pelecus cultratus), weatherfish (Misgurnus fossilis), <b>golden</b> <b>loaches</b> (Sabanejewia aurata) and spined loach (Cobitis sp.) ...|$|R

40|$|The Chu River {{originates}} in the Central Tien Shan Mountains and dissipates into the Muyunkum desert. The first {{information about the}} fish of the river was received in the middle 19 -th century. Several expeditions collected data during 20 -th century. Results of our investigations last decade in comparison with previous data allow tracking changes in the fish fauna after growing human impact. In the main, our data concern of the Kazakhstan part of the river. About 34 species and subspecies were discovered here; about 19 species between them are native. Origin or taxonomy of some species are disputable. In the last publications of the XX-th century 38 fish species and subspecies were mentioned. Native fish species as Aral barbel Barbus brachycephalus and Bulatmai barbel Barbus capito, Chu sharpray Capoetobrama kuschakewitschii and alien Sea trout Salmo trutta, Sevan trout Salmo ischchan were not found last decade in the Kazakhstan part of the river. Distribution area of native Balkhash marinka Schizothorax argentatus and alien Balkhash perch Perca schrenkii were reduced. The most widespread and numerous fish species are native roach, carp, dace, gudgeon and alien stone moroco. Native fishes like pike, asp, Aral ide, striped bystranka, <b>golden</b> spiny <b>loach,</b> southern ninespine stickleback and others were found only in certain sites. Fish species composition for each investigated site was not stable during recent years. Significant variations in fish composition were observed between different water bodies of the basin too. It reflects diversity of human impacts and unsteady water regimen here...|$|R
