40|$|The {{purpose of}} this audit was to {{evaluate}} the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) process for reviewing unliquidated interagency agreement (IA) obligations, deobligating funds, and closing IAs. The objectives of our review were to determine: (1) whether EPA has adequate controls in place to identify and deobligate unneeded IA funds, and (2) the amount of obligations under IAs that could potentially be <b>deobligated.</b> Background An IA is a written agreement between federal agencies in which one agency provides goods or services to another agency on a reimbursable basis. It is EPA’s policy to close all IAs within 270 days after the project period expires. As part of close-out, unliquidated obligations should be <b>deobligated</b> so that the funds {{can be used for}} other purposes. For further information...|$|E
40|$|MBA Professional ReportApproved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Department of Defense (DoD) has {{tens of thousands}} of contracts physically completed but not formally closedout. At issue are potentially millions of dollars that are obligated on those contracts, which could be <b>deobligated,</b> thus making them available for use by DoD. At the request of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition, (Acquisition Management) our team was formed to chart the current contract closeout process and to recommend ways to improve and transform the process while reducing the current backlog of physically completed contracts. This report identifies the steps necessary to affect contract closeout once a contract becomes physically complete. Utilizing data from available DoD and non-DoD sources and interviews from personnel managing and working within the contract closeout process at several Governmental activities involved in affecting closeout, our team (1) identifies the major causes preventing contracts from closing in a timely manner, (2) provides recommended actions {{to reduce the size of}} the overaged inventory of physically completed contracts, and (3) recommends modification to the existing closeout process to include pre-award and administration period actions in order to reduce the number of contracts that become overaged.

5000|$|NIAID {{violated}} {{both the}} bona fide needs rule and the Antideficiency Act by obligating funds {{in advance of}} an appropriation. The initial contract action obligated fiscal year 2008 funds {{for a period of}} approximately 14 months (March 1, 2008, through April 30, 2009). Subsequent modifications obligated fiscal year 2008 and 2009 funds through May 31, 2011. Because the Contract was for severable services, NIAID should have obligated only those fiscal year 2008 funds needed for program year 1 and only those fiscal year 2009 funds needed for program year 2.Additionally, NIAID violated the bona fide needs rule by obligating more funds than it needed for program year 1 and using those funds to pay for costs incurred after program year 1. Using the program year estimates provided in the Contract as evidence of the bona fide need, NIAID must resolve these violations by <b>deobligating</b> $16.9 million ($23.7 million less $6.8 million) of fiscal year 2008 funds that were obligated in excess of the agency's bona fide need for program year 1 and obligating the appropriate fiscal year funds for the program years in which the services were provided. If NIAID does not have adequate fiscal year funds available, it will violate the Antideficiency Act for these fiscal years as well.Furthermore, although NIAID estimated that it would require $6.8 million for program year 1, at the time of our audit, it had expended only $4.9 million. NIAID may not use the remaining funds for costs incurred in subsequent program years. Rather, NIAID will need to <b>deobligate</b> an additional $1.9 million ($6.8 million less $4.9 million) of fiscal year 2008 appropriations if it is determined that they are no longer needed during their period of availability. NIAID funded the Contract in compliance with the purpose requirements of appropriations statutes. …NIH did not address our recommendations to correct the improper funding for the first 2 program years of the Contract. Until NIH makes these adjustments, HHS cannot report the correct amount of its Antideficiency Act violation. Therefore, we continue to recommend that NIH record the correct Contract obligations and expenditures against the correct fiscal year funds.|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Rural Housing Service's (RHS) Section 521 Rental Assistance Program provides rental subsidies to about 250, 000 rural tenants through 5 -year contracts with project owners; 20 -year contracts were also issued from 1978 through 1982. In early 2003, RHS reported {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars in unexpended balances, primarily tied to 5 - and 20 -year contracts issued from 1978 through 1982. Since contracts remain active until all funds are expired, some of these contracts will likely last as long as 38 years. GAO was asked to assess (1) the activity level of rental assistance contracts issued from 1978 through 1997 that have unexpended balances and the possibility of <b>deobligating</b> these balances, and (2) the activity level of rental assistance contracts issued from 1998 through 2002 and the accuracy of RHS's estimates of the rate at which these funds would be used. The Department of Agriculture commented on our responses to these questions. ...|$|R
5000|$|Our review {{found that}} during fiscal years 2007 through 2009, NIH's National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) did {{not comply with}} the time and amount {{requirements}} specified in appropriations statutes in administering contract HHSN271-2007-00009C (the Contract) with Charles River Laboratories, Inc.NIDA violated both the bona fide needs rule and the Antideficiency Actby obligating funds in advance of an appropriation. The initial contract action obligated funds only for program year 1 (July 9, 2007, through July 8, 2008). However, NIDA twice modified the contract to obligate fiscal year 2007 funds through July 8, 2010, and May 1, 2011, respectively. Because the Contract was for severable services, NIDA should have obligated only those fiscal year 2007 funds needed for program year 1.Additionally, NIDA violated the bona fide needs rule by obligating more funds than it needed for program year 1 and using those funds to pay for costs incurred after program year 1. Using the program year estimates provided in the Contract {{as evidence of the}} bona fide need, NIDA must resolve these violations by <b>deobligating</b> $14.9 million ($20.2 million less $5.3 million) of fiscal year 2007 funds that were obligated in excess of the agency's bona fide need for program year 1 and obligating the appropriate fiscal year funds for the program years in which the services were provided. If NIDA does not have adequate fiscal year funds available, it will violate the Antideficiency Act for these fiscal years as well.Furthermore, although NIDA estimated that it would require $5.3 million for program year 1 and $5.2 million for program year 2, at the time of our audit, it had expended only $5.0 million and $4.4 million program years 1 and 2, respectively. NIDA may not use the remaining funds for costs incurred in subsequent program years. Rather, NIDA will need to <b>deobligate</b> an additional $0.3 million ($5.3 million less $5.0 million) of fiscal year 2007 appropriations and $0.8 million ($5.2 million less $4.4 million) of fiscal year 2008 appropriations if it is determined that they are no longer needed during their period of availability.Our audit also determined that the NIH Office of Financial Management erroneously paid an invoice for $111,000 against the Contract. NIDA funded the Contract in compliance with the purpose requirements of appropriations statutes.We recommended that NIDA:(1) Record the correct obligation for each program year against the appropriate fiscal year appropriations,(2) Record expenditures for each program year against the appropriate fiscal year appropriations,(3) Report an Antideficiency Act violation for expending fiscal year 2007 funds in advance of an appropriation,(4) Report an Antideficiency Act violation if adequate fiscal year 2009 and subsequent year funds are unavailable to cover obligations for subsequent program years,(5) Return funds that were not required for program years 1 and 2, and(6) Reverse the expenditure to the Contract for the $111,000 erroneous payment and charge the correct contract accordingly.In written comments on our draft report, NIH concurred with the findings and agreed that the Contract is severable and should have been funded with the appropriation that was current when the services were performed. NIH said that HHS would report the Antideficiency Act violation and stated that the NIH Office of Financial Management corrected the erroneously paid invoice by reversing the $111,000 payment.NIH did not address our recommendations to correct the improper funding for the first 3 program years of the Contract. Until NIH makes these adjustments, HHS cannot report the correct amount of its Antideficiency Act violation. Therefore, we continue to recommend that NIH record the correct Contract obligations and expenditures against the correct fiscal year funds.|$|R
5000|$|Our review {{found that}} during fiscal years 2006 through 2009, NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) did {{not comply with}} the time {{requirements}} and may not have complied with the amount requirements specified in appropriations statutes in administering contract HHSN266-2006-00015C (the Contract) with NexBio, Inc. …NIAID funded only $19.8 million of the $49.8 million Contract obligation with fiscal year 2006 appropriations. NIAID obligated a total of $20.0 million {{in violation of the}} bona fide needs rule: $10.0 million of fiscal year 2007 appropriated funds and $10.0 million of fiscal year 2009 appropriated funds. NIAID planned to obligate future-year appropriated funds as well. Because the Contract was a nonseverable service contract (a single undertaking that provides for a single outcome chargeable to the fiscal year in which the contract is awarded), NIAID was required to record the full amount of the Contract using fiscal year 2006 appropriated funds. By not doing so, NIAID potentially violated the Antideficiency Act. (When services are severable they are continuing and recurring and chargeable to the fiscal year in which the services are provided.) NIAID complied with the purpose requirements of appropriations statutes.We recommended that NIAID (1) <b>deobligate</b> $10.0 million of fiscal year 2007 funds and $10.0 million of fiscal year 2009 funds, (2) record the remaining $30.0 million of the $49.8 million Contract obligation against fiscal year 2006 funds, and (3) report an Antideficiency Act violation if fiscal year 2006 funds are not available.NIH concurred with the findings that the Contract is nonseverable and that it should have been funded at the time the Contract was awarded. NIH said that the Department of Health and Human Services would report the violation as required. NIH did not address our recommendations to correct the improper funding for the first 4 years of the Contract.|$|R
