The study highlights {{the potential of}} EBSD to significantly increase our understanding of deformation and annealing processes associated with the build-up of internal stresses due to strain incompatibility between grains. Two polycrystalline samples were analyzed: a natural sample of polar ice from the Vostok ice core (Antarctica) and an experimentally deformed sample of laboratory grown columnar ice. In summary, we observe the following: (1) inhomogeneous deformation through the grains is translated into lattice distortions that are concentrated mainly at grain boundaries and triple junctions (natural and <b>experimental</b> <b>sample),</b> (2) these distortions may be continuous (natural and <b>experimental</b> <b>sample)</b> or may form distinct tilt boundaries and sub-grains of 10 – 50 μm size (<b>experimental</b> <b>sample).</b> These form mainly by rearrangement of basal edge dislocations into low-energy configurations (i. e. tilt boundaries) in various prism planes.

5000|$|A {{controlled}} experiment often compares {{the results obtained}} from <b>experimental</b> <b>samples</b> against control samples, which are practically identical to the experimental sample except for the one aspect whose effect is being tested (the independent variable). A good example would be a drug trial. The sample or group receiving the drug would be the experimental group (treatment group); and the one receiving the placebo or regular treatment would be the control one. In many laboratory experiments it is good practice to have several replicate samples for the test being performed and have both a positive control and a negative control. The results from replicate samples can often be averaged, or {{if one of the}} replicates is obviously inconsistent with the results from the other samples, it can be discarded as being the result of an experimental error (some step of the test procedure may have been mistakenly omitted for that sample). Most often, tests are done in duplicate or triplicate. A positive control is a procedure similar to the actual experimental test but is known from previous experience to give a positive result. A negative control is known to give a negative result. The positive control confirms that the basic conditions of the experiment were able to produce a positive result, even if none of the actual <b>experimental</b> <b>samples</b> produce a positive result. The negative control demonstrates the base-line result obtained when a test does not produce a measurable positive result. Most often the value of the negative control is treated as a [...] "background" [...] value to subtract from the test sample results. Sometimes the positive control takes the quadrant of a standard curve.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to produce base layer winter active sportswear fabrics using natural and synthetic fibres and their blends which will deliver good comfort properties. Polyester, wool and bamboo fibres were selected for this study. Polyester is the most common fibre used in sportswear, wool is increasingly being used in sportswear and bamboo is a relatively new fibre that offers properties suitable for base layer sportswear. Bamboo is also regarded as a "green" and eco-sustainable fibre. Preliminary experiments were carried out to find the liquid moisture transfer performance of knitted fabrics made from each selected 100 % fibre blend. Preliminary <b>experimental</b> <b>sample</b> fabrics were produced as single jerseys with different cover factors. It was concluded that cover factor was influenced by loop length; whereas cover factor, physical and structural fabrics properties influenced its performance, depending on the fibre type that was used. <b>Experimental</b> single jersey <b>sample</b> fabrics were also produced from different fibre blends including wool, polyester and bamboo. The physical and structural properties selected for testing were weight/m 2, thickness, stitch density (courses/cm and wales/cm), porosity and optical porosity. The comfort properties selected for testing and analysis were liquid moisture transfer and a fabric classification with respect to the following properties: thermal conductivity, warm/cool feeling, stiffness and number of contact points. These parameters were assessed to determine the comfort properties of commercial and a range of <b>experimental</b> <b>sample</b> fabrics. It was concluded that fibre blending influenced comfort properties of <b>experimental</b> <b>sample</b> fabrics and that the most suitable for base layer winter active sportswear sample fabrics are P 100, W 43 P 57, W 35 B 65, W 52 B 48, W 60 b 40 (<b>experimental</b> <b>sample</b> fabrics and MRWB (Commercial sample fabric...|$|R

A metaphase cell is then manually selected and centered for the camera. Two types of images are taken: pictures of the stained chromosomes in their metaphase state and fluorescent images of the telomeres. The two images can then be superimposed to generate a combined image. This image can then be karyotyped or assigned nomenclature.

A peptograph is generated for each protein the sample (thousands of peptographs are generated from a single experiment) and this data format enables rapid identification of proteins undergoing proteolytic cleavage by making evident changes in gel-migration that are accompanied by altered topography.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{recommendation}} that Tooth Mousse (TM), an anticariogenic remineralizing agent, is effective for controlling dental erosion in professional wine tasters is not evidence-based. The {{aim of this}} in vitro {{study was to determine}} the effectiveness of TM in reducing erosion of coronal enamel and radicular dentine/cementum simulating a typical wine judging session. METHODS: Enamel and dentine/cementum from buccal halves (<b>experimental</b> <b>sample)</b> and palatal halves (control sample) of human maxillary premolar teeth were subjected to 1500 one-minute exposures (cycles) to white wine (pH = 3. 5). TM was applied every 20 cycles to the <b>experimental</b> <b>sample,</b> but not to the control sample. Paired t-tests were used to determine whether there were significant differences in erosion depths between the <b>experimental</b> and control <b>samples.</b> RESULTS: Mean erosion depths were significantly shallower in the <b>experimental</b> <b>sample</b> than the control sample for both enamel (34. 4 microm versus 49. 2 microm, respectively) (p < 0. 05) and dentine/cementum (143. 2 microm versus 203. 7 microm, respectively) (p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: TM may have significant role in the management of wine erosion, which is under-recognized as an occupational hazard by the Australian wine industry. Future studies are needed to compare the relative benefits of TM and other remineralizing agents, when used individually or in combination, in preventing dental erosion. C Piekarz, S. Ranjitkar, D.

His father was the oldest member of the Williams Brothers, a quartet of musical entertainers, who {{appeared}} on recordings, radio, and television, from the late 1930s to the present.Williams's work was originally inspired by the design principles in natural structure systems promoted by R. Buckminster Fuller. He {{was introduced to the}} work of Fuller by designer Peter Pearce in 1963. He finished graduate studies in structural design at Southern Illinois University in 1967, where Fuller was University Professor. While at SIU, he invented a system of clustering dome structures by using small circle Catenatic Geometry principles rather than great circles, or geodesics, as Fuller had designed into geodesic dome structures. From his research with naturally packed cell systems (biological cells, soap bubble packings, and metal crystallites) he also discovered a new space-filling polyhedron, the β-tetrakaidecahedron, the faces of which closely approximate the actual distribution of the kinds of faces found in <b>experimental</b> <b>samples</b> of cell geometry in natural systems.|$|E
5000|$|One {{specific}} type of debitage analysis is mass analysis. Mass analysis is based on analyzing debitage populations based on their size distribution across specified size grades. Ahler (1989) conducted an experimental replication under some technological settings and classified debitage into five groups according to their size, Discriminant analysis (by SPSS DISCRIMINANT function) was applied to compare mass analysis data sets for these five experimental data groups. He then compared the counts and weights of <b>experimental</b> <b>samples</b> with debris from two prehistoric workshop sites in western North Dakota. The result shows the experimental data sets can explain the technological composition of archaeological samples. Samples from several other sites also are applied this method and derive clear discriminant results. Especially in a specific function site, such as Legacy site a Late Woodland age camp in the Missouri breaks, associated with bison kill/butchering, the low frequency of cortex and a specific flake ratio (G4:Gl-3 [...] ) data indicate that a soft hammer small flake tool production, {{which is similar with}} experiment result. Although this process has been used in many studies, Andrefsky warns of the potential problems associated with the many assumptions made while employing this analysis. One in particular that he draws attention to is the possibility of differences in debitage populations based on individual variation of the artifact maker; in his example, three different knappers all using bipolar core reduction have different percentages of size grade 3 debitage (5.2%, 13.2%, and 10.2%). These differences indicate that individual variation can be influential in the size distribution of debitage and should be kept in mind if mass analysis is being employed. The reason for which Andrefsky believes mass analysis have become so popular is due to the process's ease of use and speed. Andrefsky even quotes Ahler that between individual specimen analysis and mass analysis, mass analysis has the advantage because of four reasons: 1) biases are eliminated because mass analysis looks at the entire assemblage; both completed and fractured. 2) Because mass analysis doesn't require looking at each artifact, it is very rapid and efficient. 3) debitage biases based on the sample's size are reduced since it merely captures different specimen sizes. 4) the method is highly objective and can be trained by virtually anyone.|$|E
