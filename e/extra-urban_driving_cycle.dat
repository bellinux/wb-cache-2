40|$|AbstractSeveral {{environmental}} vehicle rating tools {{have been}} developed {{in order to promote}} the purchase and the use of greener cars. However those were developed/applied at a regional/country specific level. There is a need to develop a broader methodology that can be applied in a multi-country perspective for the assessment of the environmental rating of vehicles with alternative types of fuels as well as different types of drivetrain, such as electric, hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fuel cell hybrid. The environmental indicators usually relates to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), air pollutants emissions (HC, CO, NOx, PM, SOx) and noise levels. US rating methodology developed by ACEEE is guided by Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), but disregards noise impacts (scores vehicles from zero to 100 (best)). EcoScore Belgian methodology adopts a LCA perspective, disregarding the materials of vehicle impact, but giving some importance to the noise impact (scores from zero to 100 (best)). The German Verkehrsclub Deutschland's (VCD) current rating system does not purport to be an LCA, and it has been modified based on evolving views about the importance of various automobile impacts. VCD scores from 0 to 10 (best). It considers impacts in nature both from CO 2 (vehicle manufacturer information) and pollutants (European Standards), in human health from pollutants, also considers noise. Australian Green Vehicle Guide (GVG) rating methodology considers only usage stage, giving zero to 10 (best) points to GHG and air pollutants, disregarding noise. The overall rating is based on the sum of the air pollution and greenhouse ratings (zero to five star (best)). For the vehicle in-use emissions usually a non-realistic, standard, <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> is used and again differs from country to country, despite aiming at representing urban and <b>extra-urban</b> <b>driving.</b> This paper presents the application of the revised methodologies to existent alternative vehicle technologies, pure electric vehicle (Nissan Leaf), gasoline hybrid (Toyota Prius), plug-in hybrid (Toyota Prius), conventional gasoline (VW Beetle TSI), conventional diesel (VW Golf 2. 0 Bluemotion), where the urban and <b>extra-urban</b> <b>driving</b> is considered in the same fashion at a multi-country level.

40|$|Abstract: In the {{automotive}} industry <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> {{have been used to}} evaluate vehicles in different perspectives. If a vehicle manufacturer focuses only on a fixed <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> there is a risk that controllers of the vehicle are optimized for a certain <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> and hence are sub-optimal solutions to real-world driving. To deal with this issue, it is beneficial to have a method for generating more <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> that in some sense are equivalent but not identical. The idea here is that these generated <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> have the same vehicle excitation in the mean tractive force, MTF. Using the individual force components of the MTF in the generation of <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> with Markov chains makes it possible to generate equivalent <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> that have the same vehicle excitation from real-world driving data. This is motivated since the fuel consumption estimation is more accurate when the MTF components are considered. The result is a new method that combines the generation of <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> using real-world <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> with the concept of equivalent <b>driving</b> <b>cycles,</b> and the results are promising...|$|R

Therefore, the optimal control strategy is the sticking point to effectively manage hybrid {{electric vehicle}}s. In order {{to realize the}} optimal control strategy, we use a robust evolutionary computation method called a “memetic algorithm (MA) ” to optimize the control parameters in parallel HEVs.

At the same time, driving performance requirements are also considered in the method. Four different driving cycles, the new European driving cycle (NEDC), Federal Test Procedure (FTP), Economic Commission for Europe + <b>Extra-Urban</b> <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> (ECE + EUDC), and urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) are carried out using the proposed method to find their respectively optimal control parameters.

40|$|Reduction of {{pollutant}} emission by exhaust systems due to stricter limits has drastically increased {{the impact of}} previously ignored factors {{on the results of}} emission tests. One such factor is the cooling of the engine by the chassis dynamometer's external fan. Improper cooling can increase the temperature of the engine and the catalytic converter. Preliminary studies conducted by the Motor Transport Institute have confirmed that the configuration of the cooling fan influences exhaust system emissions. This article discusses the results of tests aimed at identifying the cause of changes in emission levels. To achieve this aim, emission levels were measured for various configurations of the chassis dynamometer (including both the fan speed and the distance {{from the front of the}} vehicle). During the tests, measurements were taken of temporary pollutant levels in the CVS and of the temperature of exhaust before and after the catalytic converter. The results confirmed the findings of preliminary tests. Increased exhaust emission levels were noted, though not, as anticipated, during the urban driving cycle, but rather during the final phase of the <b>extra-urban</b> <b>driving</b> <b>cycle.</b> Measurements were taken using a single-roller chassis dynamometer equipped with a cooling fan with a regulated fan speed specified by a second-degree curve...|$|E

For more detailed specification of emission values in cities a <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> representative for a particular region needs to be designed. In the graduation thesis, the <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> for Ljubljana’s urban environment was designed. It should reflect actual driving patterns to estimate exhaust emissions and fuel consumption.

It includes collecting data on driving patterns, statistical data procession and the development of <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> mechanism design. Collecting data on speed, position and other driving parameters was obtained by taking measurements in a vehicle. The data were statistically processed.

40|$|Driving cycles are {{important}} components for evaluation {{and design of}} vehicles. They determine the focus of vehicle manufacturers, and indirectly they affect {{the environmental impact of}} vehicles since the vehicle control system is usually tuned to one or several <b>driving</b> <b>cycles.</b> Thus, the <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> affects the design of the vehicle since cost, fuel consumption, and emissions all depend on the <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> used for design. Since the existing standard <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> cannot keep up with the changing road infrastructure, the changing vehicle fleet composition, and the growing number of vehicles on the road, which do all cause changes in the driver behavior, the need to get new and representative <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> are increasing. A research question is how to generate these new <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> so that they are both representative {{and at the same time}} have certain equivalence properties, to make fair comparisons of the performance results. Besides generation, another possibility to get more <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> is to transform the existing ones into new, different, <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> considering equivalence constraints. With the development of new powertrain concepts the need for evaluation will increase, and an interesting question is how to utilize new developments in dynamometer technology together with new possibilities for connecting equipment. Here a pedal robot is developed to be used in a vehicle mounted in a chassis dynamometer and the setup is used for co-simulation together with a moving base simulator that is connected with a communication line. The results show that the co-simulation can become a realistic driving experience and a viable option for dangerous tests and a complement to tests on a dedicated track or on-road tests, if improvements on the braking and the vehicle feedback to the driver are implemented. The problem of generating representative <b>driving</b> <b>cycles,</b> with specified excitation at the wheels, is approached with a combined two-step method. AMarkov chain approach is used to generate candidate <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> that are then transformed to equivalent <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> with respect to the mean tractive force components, which are the used measures. Using an optimization methodology the transformation of <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> is formulated as a nonlinear program with constraints and a cost function to minimize. The nonlinear program formulation can handle a wide range of constraints, e. g., the mean tractive force components, different power measures, or available energy for recuperation, and using the vehicle jerk as cost function gives good drivability. In conclusion, methods for <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> design have been proposed where new <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> can either be generated from databases, or given <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> can be transformed to fulfill certain equivalence constraints, approaching the important problem of similar but not the same.

To approach this problem area, we define equivalence between <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> based on mean tractive force, and develop algorithms and methods for equivalence-modification and equivalence-transformation of <b>driving</b> <b>cycles.</b> There are a number of applications for these methods but one example that is demonstrated is to transform the well-known FTP 75 into an equivalent NEDC, and the other way around, to transform the NEDC into an equivalent FTP 75...|$|R

The driving date {{of hybrid}} bus {{which can be}} {{represent}} the city <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> is fully collected, the original data is divided into several kinematic sequences according to the velocity information, and the city hybrid bus <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> is built by using principal component analysis and cluster analysis. The results show that, the correlation coefficient of constructed <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> and original dada reaches 97 %, the actual operation situation of hybrid bus can be fully reflected, this study has good practical value. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. By {{using the}} {{relevant}} theory of Markov chain, the actual driving data are compressed and reconstructed, {{and then the}} city road <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> is constructed based on characteristic parameters such as velocity, acceleration and gradient. In the process of constructing the <b>driving</b> <b>cycle,</b> corresponding state division principle and the evaluation criteria of characteristic parameters are designed against hybrid bus. The comparison {{results show that the}} <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> constructed using Markov processes can reflect the real driving characteristics on city roads...|$|R
40|$|The present article {{deals with}} an {{investigation}} of standard <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> to identify the influence of consumption and driving range for electric vehicles. Aim of this work {{is to figure out}} if standard <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> are suitable for determining consumption of electric vehicles. Core of this item is the calculation of energy vehicles by considering auxiliary equipment in summer- and winter months. The result is a loss of driving range specified by the manufacturer and evaluated by standard <b>driving</b> <b>cycles...</b>|$|R
30|$|Drum {{tests were}} {{conducted}} based on the velocity–time curves of the <b>driving</b> <b>cycles.</b> The driver controlled the acceleration and brake pedals to maintain actual vehicle speed between {{the upper and lower}} limits of the velocity–time curve. Each <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> was run twice. The data recorded by the emission test system of the dynamometer were used as the test result. The cumulative fuel consumption {{at the end of each}} <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> was recorded, and the average fuel consumption of each cycle was considered as the effective test value.|$|R
