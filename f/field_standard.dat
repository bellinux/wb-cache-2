For example, specification for an enterprise SAS disk (a model from 2013) estimates this fraction to be one uncorrected error in every 1016 bits, and another SAS enterprise disk from 2013 specifies similar error rates. Another modern (as of 2013) enterprise SATA disk specifies an error rate of less than 10 non-recoverable read errors in every 1016 bits.

40|$|Eighteenth-century England {{produced}} {{a large number}} of influential cookbooks. Cookbook writers in this century, however, seem divided about what constitutes the appropriate scope and form of a well-written text. These divides over <b>field</b> <b>standards</b> for writing can generally be defined as a struggle between elite court cookbook writers and common country cookbook writers to determine the way the field should develop. This dissertation examines three issues facing eighteenth-century cookbook writers in shaping the conventions of their field: the role of the plain style in writing cookbooks and in creating recipes; the appropriate manner of citing previously published material and avoiding plagiarism, and the proper way to introduce innovative or novel recipes into a collection. The dissertation offers a comparative analysis of the writing styles of key eighteenth-century British cookbook writers, including Charles Carter, John Farley, Hannah Glasse, Elizabeth Raffald, and William Verrall. The study shows that rather than creating a coherent set of <b>field</b> <b>standards</b> for good writing, cookbook writing developed into high and low subfields, each with their own standards for good writing, documentation, and innovation. ...|$|R

50|$|As the Cold War {{reached its}} frostiest depths in the 1960s the {{development}} of long range aircraft allowed the Soviets regular incursion into British air space. Initially this was countered {{by the use of}} English Electric Lightning and, from 1969, McDonnell Douglas Phantom II aircraft. Again Leuchars' position made it ideally suited as a base to ensure the integrity of British air space. Leuchars was also the home in the 1970s for a Fleet Air Arm squadron (892 Naval Air Squadron) when disembarked from their carrier HMS Ark Royal, also operating Phantoms. For over two decades Leuchars' aircraft have policed the UK air defence region, demonstrating the ability to intercept unidentified aircraft and thereby providing an effective deterrent.
