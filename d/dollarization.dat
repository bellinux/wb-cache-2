5|$|Duhalde, Alfonsín, their parties, {{the unions}} and the Church all agreed to promote {{policies}} {{to increase the}} industrial growth of the country. For this purpose, Duhalde created the ministry of production, with functions that used {{to belong to the}} ministries of economy and foreign relations. The new minister was José Ignacio de Mendiguren, head of the Argentine Industrial Union. Alfonsín negotiated with him, on Duhalde's behalf, while Congress was still voting for the new president. Duhalde announced at his inauguration that he would repeal the convertibility plan, considered the main cause of the economic crisis. Although Menem proposed a full <b>dollarization</b> of the Argentine economy, Duhalde preferred to instead stick to the peso and order a devaluation. Although it was initially expected to make a 40% devaluation, the exchange rate of 1 peso to 1 dollar jumped to 3 pesos to 1 dollar, a 200% devaluation. The higher dollar price allowed for more lucrative exports, increased economic activity and a growth in the employment rates, but at the cost of a higher cost of living.|$|E

25|$|Although Ecuador {{began to}} improve {{economically}} {{in the following}} months, the government of Noboa {{came under heavy fire}} for the continuation of the <b>dollarization</b> policy, its disregard for social problems, and other important issues in Ecuadorean politics.|$|E
25|$|Some of the world's {{currencies}} {{are still}} pegged to the dollar. Some countries, such as Ecuador, El Salvador, and Panama, have gone even further and eliminated their own currency (see <b>dollarization)</b> {{in favor of}} the United States dollar.|$|E
25|$|Current {{impediments to}} growth include a small {{domestic}} market, {{lack of adequate}} infrastructure, high transportation costs, poor trade links with neighboring countries and the high <b>dollarization</b> of the economy.

25|$|<b>Dollarization</b> {{started in}} the 1980s and {{continued}} to the early 90s when the United Nations contributed humanitarian aid, refugees began sending remittances home, and inflation as high as 177% per year eroded confidence in the riel. From 1991-1993, the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia stationed 22,000 personnel throughout Cambodia, whose spending represented {{a large part of}} the Cambodian economy.|$|E
25|$|A {{dominant}} currency {{may be used}} {{directly or}} indirectly by other nations – for example, English kings minted gold mancus, presumably to function as dinars to exchange with Islamic Spain; colonial powers sometimes minted coins that resembled the ones already used in a distant territory; and more recently, a number of nations have used the US dollar as their local currency, a custom called <b>dollarization.</b>|$|E

25|$|Mahuad {{concluded}} a well-received peace with Peru on October 26, 1998, but increasing economic, fiscal, and financial difficulties drove his popularity steadily lower. However, {{the coup de}} grâce for Mahuad's administration was Mahuad's decision to make the local currency, the sucre (named after Antonio José de Sucre), obsolete {{and replace it with}} the U.S. dollar (a policy called <b>dollarization).</b> This caused massive unrest as the lower classes struggled to convert their now useless sucres to US dollars and lost wealth, while the upper classes (whose members already had their wealth invested in US dollars) gained wealth in turn. Under Mahuad's recession-plagued term, the economy shrank significantly, and inflation reached levels of up to 60 percent.|$|E

25|$|The International Monetary Fund {{stated in}} June 2017 that annual {{growth in the}} economy was just over 4% and that the {{financial}} system was sound. The IMF expressed concern however, about increasing deficits and public debt {{as well as the}} heavy <b>dollarization</b> of bank assets and liabilities. Costa Rica's public debt is problematic, especially {{as a percentage of the}} GDP, increasing from 29.8% in 2011 to 40.8% in 2015. Of the proposed 2017 budget (US$15.9 billion), debt payments account for one-third of the total and a full 46% of the budget will require financing. That will increase the deficit and the debt owed to foreign entities. The value of the Costa Rican colone per US$1 was 526.46₡ on March 27, 2015. At the end of July 2017, the value was 563₡.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dollarization</b> {{occurs when}} the {{inhabitants}} of a country use foreign currency in parallel to or instead of the domestic currency.

50|$|Firstly, {{liability}} <b>dollarization</b> (see Domestic liability <b>dollarization)</b> is {{one main}} reason against floating exchange rate. It {{refers to the}} situations where liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies (usually denominated in US dollar) while assets are in the local currency. Consequently. liability <b>dollarization</b> is also used interchangeably with currency mismatch. Under this currency mismatch, an unexpected depreciation of local currency would deteriorate bank and corporation's balance sheets, and the shrink in asset relative to foreign currency debts would threaten {{the stability of the}} financial system in local country. In countries with significant currency mismatches, the balance sheet effect is quite substantial, ignoring the high exchange rate volatility can prove to be very costly. This could provide an argument for sterilized foreign market intervention.|$|E
