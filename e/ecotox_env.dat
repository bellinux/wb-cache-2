40|$|We {{consider}} {{the interaction between}} a general size-structured consumer population and an unstructured resource. We show that stability properties and bifurcation phenomena can {{be understood in terms}} of solutions of a system of two delay equations (a renewal equation for the consumer population birth rate coupled to a delay differential equation for the resource concentration). As many results for such systems are available (Diekmann et al. in SIAM J Math Anal 39 : 1023 – 1069, 2007), we can draw rigorous conclusions concerning dynamical behaviour from an analysis of a characteristic equation. We derive the characteristic equation for a fairly general class of population models, including those based on the Kooijman–Metz Daphnia model (Kooijman and Metz in <b>Ecotox</b> <b>Env</b> Saf 8 : 254 – 274, 1984; de Roos et al. in J Math Biol 28 : 609 – 643, 1990) and a model introduced by Gurney–Nisbet (Theor Popul Biol 28 : 150 – 180, 1985) and Jones et al. (J Math Anal Appl 135 : 354 – 368, 1988), and next obtain various ecological insights by analytical or numerical studies of special case...|$|E
