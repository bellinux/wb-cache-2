5|$|After {{catching}} {{very few}} passes {{in high school}} and college, Berry was drafted in the 20th round of the 1954 NFL Draft by the Colts and was considered a long shot to even make the team's roster. Diminutive and unassuming, his subsequent rise to the Pro Football Hall of Fame has been touted as one of American football's Cinderella stories. He made up for his lack of athleticism through rigorous practice and attention to detail, and was known for his near-perfect route running and sure <b>handedness.</b> Berry was a favorite target of quarterback Johnny Unitas, and the two were regarded as the dominant passing and receiving duo of their era.|$|E
5|$|As already described, chiral liquid-crystal {{molecules}} usually {{give rise}} to chiral mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a stereogenic center. An additional requirement is that the system not be racemic: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, {{a small amount of}} chiral dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is often enough to select out one domain <b>handedness,</b> making the system overall chiral.|$|E
5|$|The core {{gameplay}} of the Guitar Hero {{games is}} a rhythm game similar to Konami's Guitar Freaks {{and to a}} lesser extent Harmonix's previous music games such as Frequency and Amplitude. The guitar controller is recommended for play, although a standard console controller can be used instead. However, the guitar controller has been required for play ever since the inclusion of drum and vocal parts in the series. The game supports toggling the <b>handedness</b> of the guitar, allowing both left-handed and right-handed players to utilize the guitar controller.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} for chiral LC molecules to produce essentially achiral mesophases. For instance, in certain ranges of concentration and molecular weight, DNA will form an achiral line hexatic phase. An interesting recent observation is {{of the formation of}} chiral mesophases from achiral LC molecules. Specifically, bent-core molecules (sometimes called banana liquid crystals) have been shown to form liquid crystal phases that are chiral. In any particular sample, various domains will have opposite <b>handedness,</b> but within any given domain, strong chiral ordering will be present. The appearance mechanism of this macroscopic chirality is not yet entirely clear. It appears that the molecules stack in layers and orient themselves in a tilted fashion inside the layers. These liquid crystals phases may be ferroelectric or anti-ferroelectric, both of which are of interest for applications.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{research}} has focused on chess as mental training; the respective roles of knowledge and look-ahead search; brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices; blindfold chess; the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill; gender differences; and computational models of chess expertise. The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much {{recent research}}. Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess. Recent research indicates that factors other than practice are also important. For example, Fernand Gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere {{are more likely to have}} been born in late winter and early spring. Compared to general population, chess players are more likely to be non-right-handed, though they found no correlation between <b>handedness</b> and skill.|$|E
5|$|Several {{changes have}} been made to the {{gameplay}} mechanics for Guitar Hero II: hammer-on and pull-off functionality has been improved, and three note chords have been introduced, scored as triple points if played correctly. There are additional statistics available for a song upon completion, and the scores achieved in either Quick Play or Career mode are saved to the same in-game high-score list. The <b>handedness</b> of the guitar can now be toggled from the Pause menu when playing a song (previously, this was only available from the game's main menu). For the Xbox 360 version, scores can also be compared with other players through Xbox Live via the Leaderboard feature, and there are 50 Achievements that can be earned in the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{chiral nematic}} phase {{exhibits}} chirality (<b>handedness).</b> This phase {{is often called}} the cholesteric phase because it was first observed for cholesterol derivatives. Only chiral molecules (i.e., those that have no internal planes of symmetry) can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle {{with respect to the}} layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.|$|E
5|$|When compared, Black signers {{were more}} likely than were White signers to produce signs outside of the typical signing space and to use two-handed signs. Adverbs are most likely to use a larger signing space. Less marked forms, such as pronouns, determiners, plain verbs, and nouns, tend to be less likely to be {{produced}} outside the typical signing space. The selection of two-handed signs over one-handed signs was found to have systematic constraints on their production. When the sign could be produced with one or two hands, Black signers often produced the variant that matched the <b>handedness</b> of the following sign; if the following sign was two-handed, they {{were more likely}} to produce a two-handed variant, while if the following sign was one-handed, {{they were more likely to}} produce the one-handed variant. The use of innovative one-handed forms, though, even in environments which favored them, did not exceed 50 percent.|$|E
25|$|Quantum {{physicists}} {{also use}} this convention of <b>handedness</b> {{because it is}} consistent with their convention of <b>handedness</b> for a particle’s spin.|$|E
25|$|The {{gradient}} and divergence {{require only}} the inner product, while the curl and the cross product also requires the <b>handedness</b> of the coordinate {{system to be}} taken into account (see cross product and <b>handedness</b> for more detail).|$|E
25|$|To {{convert a}} given <b>handedness</b> of {{polarized}} {{light to the}} other <b>handedness</b> one can use a half-wave plate. A half-wave plate shifts a given component of light one half of a wavelength relative to the component {{to which it is}} orthogonal.|$|E
25|$|When {{using this}} convention, in {{contrast}} to the other convention, the defined <b>handedness</b> of the wave matches the <b>handedness</b> of the screw type nature of the field in space. Specifically, if one freezes a right-handed wave in time, when one curls the fingers of one’s right hand around the helix, the thumb will point in the direction which the helix progresses given that sense of rotation. Note that it is the nature of all screws and helices that it does not matter in which direction you point your thumb when determining its <b>handedness.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{homogeneous}} circular polarizer passes one <b>handedness</b> of {{circular polarization}} unaltered and blocks the other <b>handedness.</b> This {{is similar to}} the way that a linear polarizer would fully pass one angle of linearly polarized light unaltered, but would fully block any linearly polarized light that was orthogonal to it.|$|E
25|$|A {{rotation}} {{that does}} not leave <b>handedness</b> unchanged is an improper rotation or a rotoinversion.|$|E
25|$|Euler angles {{between two}} {{reference}} frames are defined only if both frames {{have the same}} <b>handedness.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{measurable}} quantities involve cross products, the <b>handedness</b> of the coordinate systems used cannot be arbitrary. However, when physics laws are written as equations, {{it should be}} possible to make an arbitrary choice of the coordinate system (including <b>handedness).</b> To avoid problems, one should be careful to never write down an equation where the two sides do not behave equally under all transformations that need to be considered. For example, if one side of the equation is a cross product of two vectors, one must take into account that when the <b>handedness</b> of the coordinate system is not fixed a priori, the result is not a (true) vector but a pseudovector. Therefore, for consistency, the other side must also be a pseudovector.|$|E
25|$|Changes of {{this sort}} change the <b>handedness</b> of the axes so {{it is easy to}} reverse the {{chirality}} of the displayed molecule unless care is taken.|$|E
25|$|Because 11% of the {{selected}} handaxes appeared to be left-handed axes, the conclusion is that modern human <b>handedness</b> was already appearing in the Early to Middle Stone Age, almost 1 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|In cricket, he was batsman {{of unknown}} <b>handedness,</b> and played nine {{first-class}} {{games for the}} Marylebone Cricket Club between 1840 and 1846, as well as appearing once for the Cambridge University cricket team and again for a first-class Invitational XI match.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the cross}} product {{requires}} the <b>handedness</b> of the coordinate {{system to be}} taken into account (as explicit in the definition above). If a left-handed coordinate system is used, the direction of the vector n is given by the left-hand rule and points in the opposite direction.|$|E
25|$|The {{legality}} of the switch hit was questioned when first introduced, but cleared by the International Cricket Council as legal. The shot is risky because a batsman is less proficient in the other <b>handedness</b> and {{is more likely to}} make a mistake in the execution of his shot.|$|E
25|$|In this {{alternative}} convention, polarization is defined {{from the point}} of view of the receiver. Using this convention, left or right <b>handedness</b> is determined by pointing one’s left or right thumb toward the source, against the direction of propagation, and then matching the curling of one's fingers to the temporal rotation of the field.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{situation}} {{and the type of}} pitcher, the 12–6 curveball may be more or less effective. Against a batter with the same <b>handedness</b> as the pitcher, the 12 to 6 curveball has been proven to be a very effective pitch in general, but the pitch is much easier to hit if the batter is are the opposite <b>handedness</b> of the pitcher, making an 11 to 5 curveball the more effective pitch type in that situation. The effectiveness of the pitch also depends on the ability of the pitcher to apply topspin to the ball, creating movement. When stats for a high level pitcher's average 12 to 6 curveball are factored in, the 12 to 6 and the 11 to 5 are much more effective than Major League Baseball's average throwers of the pitch due to the pitcher's high level of ability for that pitch.|$|E
25|$|A switch hit is a shot where a batsman {{changes his}} <b>handedness</b> and posture {{to adopt a}} stance the mirror image of his {{traditional}} <b>handedness</b> while the bowler is running in to bowl. As a fielding team cannot manoeuvre fielders while the bowler is in his run-up, the fielding side is effectively wrong-footed with the fielders out of position. The shot was pioneered by Kevin Pietersen, first performed off the bowling of Muttiah Muralitharan in England's 2006 home series against Sri Lanka. It was subsequently used in the New Zealand series in England in 2008 when Pietersen performed the shot twice in the same innings {{on his way to}} making an unbeaten century. David Warner, the Australian opening batsman, is also a frequent user of the switch hit and used it to great effect against the Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin in the first Twenty20 of the Indian cricket team's tour to Australia 2012.|$|E
25|$|To {{create a}} {{circular}} polarizer that instead passes right-handed polarized light and absorbs left-handed light, one again rotates the wave plate and linear polarizer 90° relative to each another. It {{is easy to}} appreciate that {{by reversing the positions}} of the transmitting and absorbing axes of the linear polarizer relative to the quarter-wave plate, one changes which <b>handedness</b> of polarized light gets transmitted and which gets absorbed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the quantum}} {{mechanical}} view, light {{is composed of}} photons. Polarization is {{a manifestation of the}} intrinsic angular momentum (the spin) of the photon. More specifically, in quantum mechanics the direction of spin of a photon is tied to the <b>handedness</b> of the circularly polarized light and the spin of a beam of photons is similar to the spin of a beam of particles, such as electrons.|$|E
25|$|The Faraday {{effect is}} caused by left and right circularly {{polarized}} waves propagating at slightly different speeds, a property known as circular birefringence. Since a linear polarization can be decomposed into the superposition of two equal-amplitude circularly polarized components of opposite <b>handedness</b> and different phase, {{the effect of a}} relative phase shift, induced by the Faraday effect, is to rotate the orientation of a wave's linear polarization.|$|E
25|$|Mirror image twins result when a fertilized egg splits {{later in}} the {{embryonic}} stage than normal timing, around day 9–12. This type of twinning could exhibit characteristics with reversed asymmetry, such as opposite dominant <b>handedness,</b> dental structure, or even organs (situs inversus). If the split occurs later than this time period, the twins risk being conjoined. There is no DNA-based zygosity test that can determine if twins are indeed mirror image.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that an individual's body schema is used to {{represent}} both one's own body and the bodies of others. Mirror neurons are thought {{to play a role}} in the interpersonal characteristics of body schema. Interpersonal projection of one's body schema plays an important role in successfully imitating motions such as hand gestures, especially while maintaining the <b>handedness</b> and location of the gesture, but not necessarily copying the exact motion itself.|$|E
25|$|In most cases, speech {{production}} {{is controlled by}} the left hemisphere. In a series of studies, Wilder Penfield, among others, probed the brains of both right-handed (generally left-hemisphere dominant) and left-handed (generally right-hemisphere dominant) patients. They discovered that, regardless of <b>handedness,</b> the left hemisphere was almost always the speech controlling side. However, it has been discovered that in cases of neural stress (hemorrhage, stroke, etc.) the right hemisphere has the ability to take control of speech functions.|$|E
25|$|Most acute {{cases of}} aphasia recover some or most skills {{by working with}} a speech-language pathologist. Recovery and {{improvement}} can continue for years after the stroke. After the onset of Aphasia, there is approximately a six-month period of spontaneous recovery; during this time, the brain is attempting to recover and repair the damaged neurons. Improvement varies widely, depending on the aphasia's cause, type, and severity. Recovery also depends on the patient's age, health, motivation, <b>handedness,</b> and educational level.|$|E
25|$|Robert Andrew Bathurst (22 January 1817 - 31 March 1906) was an English cricketer who, {{during his}} {{education}} at New College, Oxford, between 1835 and 1839, made six appearances for the Oxford University cricket team, playing against both the Cambridge and Marylebone Cricket Club teams. A batsman of unknown <b>handedness,</b> Bathurst opened the batting for his University team, scoring fifty-five runs across twelve innings {{at a low}} average of 4.58 runs and a best of 22.|$|E
25|$|Gauss Code {{is limited}} {{in its ability to}} {{identify}} knots by a few problems. The starting point on the knot at which to begin tracing the crossings is arbitrary, {{and there is no way}} to determine which direction to trace in. Also, Gauss Code is unable to indicate the <b>handedness</b> of each crossing, which is necessary to identify a knot versus its mirror. For example, the Gauss Code for the trefoil knot does not specify if it is the right-handed or left-handed trefoil.|$|E
25|$|Drawing {{molecules}} {{requires a}} transformation between molecular coordinates (usually, but not always, in Angstrom units) and the screen. Because many molecules are chiral {{it is essential}} that the <b>handedness</b> of the system (almost always right-handed) is preserved. In molecular graphics the origin (0, 0) is usually at the lower left, while in many computer systems the origin is at top left. If the z-coordinate is out of the screen (towards the viewer) the molecule will be referred to right-handed axes, while the screen display will be left-handed.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{hearing of}} this, Justinian {{is said to}} have gone into another one of his rages. He was already unpopular at the young age of 23. His heavy <b>handedness</b> in extracting the tax money from the peasants and the rich made him deeply resented, {{especially}} with his use of torture, which included the use of fire and whips. It was therefore to no one's surprise (though to many a Byzantine's delight) that rebellion came from the ranks of the aristocracy. The revolt found a leader in a professional but disgraced soldier, Leontius.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes a spinner will bowl leg {{theory and}} have seven fielders {{on the leg}} side, and will bowl {{significantly}} wide of the leg stump to prevent scoring. Often the ball is so wide that the batsman cannot hit the ball straight of mid-on while standing still, and cannot hit to the off side unless they try unorthodox and risky shots such as a reverse sweep or pull, or switch their <b>handedness.</b> The batsman can back away to the leg side to hit through the off side, but can expose their stumps in doing so.|$|E
