He worked with Stiller again on 2009's [...] in which Azaria played the villainous pharaoh Kah Mun Rah, utilizing a Boris Karloff accent. Although the film received mixed reviews, critics praised Azaria's performance. Perry Seibert of TV Guide wrote that [...] "thanks to Azaria, a master of comic timing.

But you can be quite <b>funny</b> <b>when</b> you're feeling everything's pointless. He does some things that are so cruel and cold that they're actually quite funny." [...] While the character had once been known for his brash taste in bright, flamboyant shirts, The Sun noted that Abra's return saw him a [...] "shadow of his former self", wearing far less colourful apparel as a reflection of his more subdued state of mind.

Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave the episode a positive review, stating: [...] "Good fun story, good fun jokes", but said that the end [...] "felt flat" [...] because of the Revenge of the Nerds music sequence.|$|E

Tim Grobaty of the Press-Telegram, on the other hand, wrote negatively of the album, stating [...] "Yankovic's songs {{are the kinds of things}} that are sort of funny in concept, less <b>funny</b> <b>when</b> you actually hear them once, and increasingly irritating with each subsequent listen [...] his food songs are among his worst." ...|$|E

The animatronic of the Dalek mutant had to be recreated for the episode, because the previous prop that was used in [...] "Dalek" [...] and [...] "The Parting of the Ways" [...] was irreversibly damaged by water when the latter was filmed. [...] "The Stolen Earth" [...] features two new variants of Daleks: the Supreme Dalek, coloured red as an allusion to the Peter Cushing film Dr. Who and the Daleks; and the partially destroyed Dalek Caan. Caan was described in the shooting script as: [...] Voice actor Nicholas Briggs adopted a different voice for each model: he adopted a grandiose voice for the Supreme Dalek to fit his perception of the character as egotistical; and he adopted a sing-song voice for Caan to reflect the character's insanity as a result of entering the Time War. Briggs justified his interpretation of Caan by explaining that [...] " [...] can't tell when he's happy or sad, his emphasis is very strange and he finds things <b>funny</b> <b>when</b> things aren't funny", creating a soothsayer personality with an [...] "almost pure" [...] mind.

The production had a difficult start due to Hepburn's struggles with her character and her comedic abilities.

500|$|That same year, Cooper {{made two}} films with {{director}} and good friend Howard Hawks. In the biographical film Sergeant York, Cooper portrays war hero Alvin C.

The film chronicles York's early backwoods days in Tennessee, his religious conversion and subsequent piety, his stand as a conscientious objector, and finally his heroic actions at the Battle of the Argonne Forest, which earned him the Medal of Honor. Initially, Cooper was nervous and uncertain about playing a living hero, so he traveled to Tennessee to visit York at his home, and the two quiet men established an immediate rapport and discovered they had much in common. Inspired by York's encouragement, Cooper delivered a performance that Howard Barnes of the New York Herald Tribune called [...] "one of extraordinary conviction and versatility", and that Archer Winston of the New York Post called [...] "one of his best". After the film's release, Cooper was awarded the Distinguished Citizenship Medal by the Veterans of Foreign Wars for his [...] "powerful contribution to the promotion of patriotism and loyalty". York admired Cooper's performance and helped promote the film for Warner Bros. Sergeant York became the top-grossing film of the year and was nominated for eleven Academy Awards. Accepting his first Academy Award for Best Actor from his friend James Stewart, Cooper said, [...] "It was Sergeant Alvin York who won this award.
