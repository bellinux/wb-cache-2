5|$|It was {{observed}} that immediately after going to bed, generally at about 8:00pm, Domery {{would begin to}} sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless {{of what he had}} eaten before going to bed. At this time, he would <b>eat</b> <b>any</b> available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he would go back to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; {{as soon as he got}} out of bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the War of the First Coalition Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army. With {{military}} rations unable to satisfy his large appetite, he would <b>eat</b> <b>any</b> available food from gutters and refuse heaps but his condition still deteriorated through hunger. Suffering from exhaustion, he was hospitalised and became the subject of a series of medical experiments to test his eating capacity, in which, among other things, he ate a meal intended for 15 people in a single sitting, ate live cats, snakes, lizards and puppies, and swallowed an eel whole without chewing. Despite his unusual diet, he was of normal size and appearance, and showed no signs of mental illness other than what was described as an apathetic temperament.|$|E

5|$|Spotted hyenas {{will follow}} packs of African wild dogs {{in order to}} {{appropriate}} their kills. They will typically inspect areas where wild dogs have rested and <b>eat</b> <b>any</b> food remains they find. When approaching wild dogs at a kill, solitary hyenas will approach cautiously and attempt to take off {{with a piece of}} meat unnoticed, though they may be mobbed by the dogs in the attempt. When operating in groups, spotted hyenas are more successful in pirating dog kills, though the dog's greater tendency to assist each other puts them at an advantage against spotted hyenas, who rarely work in unison. Cases of dogs scavenging from spotted hyenas are rare. Although wild dog packs can easily repel solitary hyenas, on the whole, {{the relationship between the two}} species is a one sided benefit for the hyenas, with wild dog densities being negatively correlated with high hyena populations.|$|E
5|$|Like all cats, the jaguar is an obligate carnivore, feeding only on meat. It is an {{opportunistic}} {{hunter and}} its diet encompasses at least 87 species. The jaguar can take virtually any terrestrial or riparian vertebrate found in Central or South America, with {{a preference for}} large prey. The jaguar {{is more of a}} dietary generalist than its Old World cousins: the American tropics have a high diversity of small animals but relatively low populations and diversity of the large ungulates which this genus favors. They regularly take adult caimans, deer, capybaras, tapirs, peccaries, dogs, zorros, and sometimes even anacondas. However, the cat will <b>eat</b> <b>any</b> small species that can be caught, including frogs, mice, birds (mainly ground-based species such as cracids), fish, sloths, monkeys, and turtles; a study conducted in Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize, for example, revealed that the diets of jaguars there consisted primarily of armadillos and pacas. Some jaguars will also take domestic livestock. El Jefe, the only jaguar currently living within the territory of the United States, has also been found to kill and eat American black bears, as deduced from hairs found within his scats and the partly consumed carcass of a black bear sow with the distinctive puncture marks to the skull left by jaguars. This indicates that jaguars might have once preyed on black bears when the species was still present in the area. Spectacled bears are also known to avoid jaguars, possibly because they may constitute occasional prey items.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{starts with}} a mission explaining {{the origins of the}} Majapahit Empire, wherein Raden Wijaya leads the Malays to victory against the Mongols, the Singhasari, and the Kediri. Gajah Mada proper then appears on the scene to rescue King Jayanegara from the city of Trowulan, which is surrounded by rebels. However, Jayanegara is dissolute and is soon assassinated. His sister, Tribhuwana, takes power and appoints Gajah Mada as her prime minister. Gajah Mada then swears his famous Sumpah Palapa oath to unify Nusantara, whereupon he will not <b>eat</b> <b>any</b> food containing spices until the whole Indonesian archipelago is unified. The Majapahit empire then proceeds to expand settlements to the islands of Bali, Sulawesi, and Borneo, and has conflicts with the Sunda, Dhamasraya, and Tumasik. The queen regent then abdicates to let her now-matured son, Hayam Wuruk, ascend the throne, and the Majapahit Empire then expands to the east by destroying the Docks of Makassar, Kutai, and Luwu. The sole group which remains are the Sunda, and Gajah Mada manipulates them into a trap by arranging for a marriage between his king and a Sunda princess. Whereas the Sunda believe that the marriage will result in an alliance, Gajah Mada has written into the contract that via the marriage, the Sunda will submit to Majapahit rule, unbeknownst to Hayam Wuruk. The result is the Pasunda Bubat Massacre, wherein all the Sunda princes are killed and Hayam Wuruk's bride commits suicide out of grief. Gajah Mada is then summoned to the king and exiled for his actions.|$|E

25|$|Manoah {{was told}} by his wife what happened, and Manoah entreated God to let the man of God come again and teach them what to do.

Manoah's wife ran and told Manoah, and he {{followed}} her to the angel, and asked him whether {{he was the one}} who had spoken to his wife, and he said that he was. Manoah asked the angel how they should raise the child, and the angel told him that they should do what he had told Manoah's wife: She was not to <b>eat</b> <b>any</b> product of the grapevine, drink wine or strong drink, or <b>eat</b> <b>any</b> unclean thing.|$|E

25|$|Pet {{owners were}} advised {{to monitor their}} animals for the {{following}} signs of possible kidney failure that {{may be associated with}} the unknown toxicant: loss of appetite, lethargy, depression, vomiting, diarrhea, sudden changes in water consumption, and changes in the frequency or amount of urination. It was advised that pets exhibiting these symptoms should be taken for veterinary care as soon as possible, even if the animal did not <b>eat</b> <b>any</b> of the recalled pet food, as these signs may be indicative of other illnesses. Ultrasounds of animals who have eaten the contaminated food in most cases show cortical echogenicity, perirenal fluid and pyelectasia.|$|E
25|$|The diet {{choice that}} the player made in prior stages, whether herbivore, omnivore, or carnivore, determines what food the tribe can gather and eat. Animals can be hunted for meat, and fish or seaweed can be speared for food. Fruit is {{gathered}} from trees and bushes, and players can also domesticate animals for eggs, which all diet types can <b>eat.</b> <b>Any</b> foreign {{animals in the}} player's pack in the Creature Stage are automatically added to the tribe as farm animals. Epic creatures may threaten nests or tribes. Allied tribes will occasionally bring the player gifts of food. Players can steal food from other tribes (though it angers them), and dead tribes may be pillaged for their food.|$|E
25|$|Baby mice, called pinkies or pups, {{are born}} blind, naked, and deaf. Their {{eyes are closed}} and their ears are stuck {{to the sides of}} their heads.

Eyes open at 14 days, and the babies will start {{exploring}} the world around them. At three weeks old they look like miniature versions of adult mice. At four weeks the males in the litter should be separated out so as to not cause the mother and sisters to become pregnant, while the females can be left in with the mother.|$|E

25|$|Menstruating women {{suffered}} numerous restrictions. The Ashanti viewed them as ritually unclean. They did not {{cook for}} men, {{nor did they}} <b>eat</b> <b>any</b> food cooked for a man. If a menstruating woman entered the ancestral stool house, she was arrested, and the punishment was typically death. If this punishment is not exacted, the Ashanti believe, the ghost of the ancestors would strangle the chief. Menstruating women lived in special houses during their periods as they were forbidden to cross the threshold of men's houses. They swore no oaths and no oaths were sworn for or against them. They {{did not participate in}} any of the ceremonial observances and did not visit any sacred places.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with , many Hindus embrace vegetarianism to respect higher forms of life. Estimates of strict lacto vegetarians in India (includes adherents of all religions) who never <b>eat</b> <b>any</b> meat, fish or eggs vary between 20% and 42%, {{while others are}} either less strict vegetarians or non-vegetarians. Those who eat meat seek Jhatka (quick death) method of meat production, and dislike Halal (slow bled death) method, believing that quick death method reduces suffering to the animal. The food habits vary with region, with Bengali Hindus and Hindus living in Himalayan regions, or river delta regions, regularly eating meat and fish. Some avoid meat on specific festivals or occasions. Observant Hindus who do eat meat almost always abstain from beef. The cow in Hindu society is traditionally identified as a caretaker and a maternal figure, and Hindu society honours the cow {{as a symbol of}} unselfish giving.|$|E
25|$|In {{fields and}} {{plantations}} of plants {{they do not}} like to eat, e.g., cereals or eucalyptus, the greater rhea can be a species quite beneficial to farmers. It will <b>eat</b> <b>any</b> large invertebrate it can catch; its food includes locusts and grasshoppers, true bugs, cockroaches, and other pest insects. Juveniles eat more animal matter than adults. In mixed cerrado and agricultural land in Minas Gerais (Brazil), R. a. americana was noted to be particularly fond of beetles. It is not clear whether this applies to the species in general but for example in pampas habitat, beetle consumption is probably lower simply due to availability while Orthoptera might be more important. The greater rhea is able to eat Hymenoptera in quantity. These insects contain among them many who can give painful stings, though the birds do not seem to mind. Sometimes, greater rheas will gather at carrion to feed on flies; they are also known to eat dead or dying fish in the dry season, but as vertebrate prey in general not in large quantities.|$|E
30|$|Protein intake {{is closely}} related to child stunting. The more often the {{children}} ate protein in the previous week, compared to not <b>eating</b> <b>any</b> (in terms of number of days), the lower their likelihood of being stunted (OR 0.87, p <  0.05).|$|R
