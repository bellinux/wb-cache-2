40|$|Abstract Background The {{promyelocytic leukemia}} (PML) protein participates {{in a number}} of {{cellular}} processes, including transcription regulation, apoptosis, differentiation, virus defense and genome maintenance. This protein is structurally organized into a tripartite motif (TRIM) at its N-terminus, a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at its central region and a C-terminus that varies between alternatively spliced isoforms. Most PML splice variants target the nucleus where they define sub-nuclear compartments termed PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs). However, PML variants that lack the NLS are also expressed, suggesting the existence of PML isoforms with cytoplasmic functions. In the present study we expressed PML isoforms with a mutated NLS in U 2 OS cells to identify potential cytoplasmic compartments targeted by this protein. Results Expression of NLS mutated PML isoforms in U 2 OS cells revealed that PML I targets early endosomes, PML II targets the inner nuclear membrane (partially due to an extra NLS at its C-terminus), and PML III, IV and V target late endosomes/lysosomes. Clustering of PML at all of these subcellular locations depended on a <b>functional</b> <b>TRIM</b> domain. Conclusions This study demonstrates the capacity of PML to form macromolecular protein assemblies at several different subcellular sites. Further, it emphasizes a role of the variable C-terminus in subcellular target selection and a general role of the N-terminal TRIM domain in promoting protein clustering. </p...|$|R

40|$|The Drosophila protein {{brain tumor}} (Brat) forms a complex with Pumilio (Pum) and Nanos (Nos) to repress hunchback (hb) mRNA {{translation}} at the posterior pole during early embryonic development. It is currently thought that complex formation is initiated by Pum, which directly binds the hb mRNA and subsequently recruits Nos and Brat. Here we report that, {{in addition to}} Pum, Brat also directly interacts with the hb mRNA. We identify Brat-binding sites distinct from the Pum consensus motif and show that RNA binding and translational repression by Brat do not require Pum, suggesting so far unrecognized Pum-independent Brat functions. Using various biochemical and biophysical methods, we also demonstrate that the NHL (NCL- 1, HT 2 A, and LIN- 41) domain of Brat, a domain previously believed to mediate protein–protein interactions, is a novel, sequence-specific ssRNA-binding domain. The Brat-NHL domain folds into a six-bladed β propeller, and we identify its positively charged top surface as the RNA-binding site. Brat belongs to the <b>functional</b> diverse <b>TRIM</b> (tripartite motif) -NHL protein family.

40|$|The nucleotide-binding {{domain and}} leucine-rich repeat {{containing}} gene (NLR) family member NOD 2 {{is involved in}} mediating antimicrobial innate immune responses. Uncontrolled NOD 2 activity can lead to severe inflammatory disorders, but the regulation of NOD 2 is still poorly understood. The NOD 2 ATPase domain seems to exhibit a crucial regulatory function. Mutations affecting conserved residues of this domain {{are linked to the}} auto-inflammatory diseases Blau syndrome and early-onset sarcoidosis, whereas mutation of the Walker A box lead to signalling repression. Conserved amino acids within the ATPase domain of NOD 2 and the related NLR protein NOD 1 were analysed in a systematic mutational approach. The results revealed that a functional Walker A and B box, GxP motif and Sensor 1 are important for both NOD 1 and NOD 2 activation, as mutation of these residues strongly impaired NF-B activation. This indicates that nucleotide binding and an initial nucleotide hydrolysis step are essential for both NOD 1 and NOD 2 activation. Furthermore, the data gave evidence that mutations in the extended Walker B box and the WH histidine have opposing effects on NOD 1 - and NOD 2 -mediated signalling. Whereas they were non-functional in NOD 1, NOD 2 auto-activation was enhanced compared to the wild type. This led us to propose that NOD 2 is more prone for auto-activation and need to be more tightly controlled than NOD 1. In line with this assumption, NOD 2, but not NOD 1, was found to be subjected to rapid protein turnover involving ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified TRIM 27 as a new binding partner for NOD 2. The specificity of this interaction was confirmed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments in a human cell line. The interaction was mediated by the NOD 2 nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and the TRIM 27 PRY-SPRY motif. TRIM 27 is a RING domain E 3 ubiquitin ligase. NOD 2, but not NOD 1, was identified to be ubiquitinated with K 48 -linked ubiquitin chains and subjected to proteasomal degradation dependent on <b>functional</b> <b>TRIM</b> 27. Accordingly, TRIM 27 negatively affected NOD 2 -mediated pro-inflammatory responses. The NOD 2 -TRIM 27 interaction was enhanced upon stimulation with the NOD 2 agonist MDP. This suggests that TRIM 27 is involved in a negative feed-back loop to control NOD 2 -mediated signalling. Of note, TRIM 27 is a nuclear protein in most human cells. This study demonstrated that also NOD 2 can shuttle to the nucleus and co-localizes with TRIM 27. NOD 2 loss-of-function mutations are associated with Crohn’s disease. Analysis of colonic biopsies from Crohn’s disease patients revealed significantly enhanced TRIM 27 mRNA expression, underscoring a physiological role of TRIM 27 in regulating NOD 2 signalling. We conclude that TRIM 27 negatively regulates NOD 2 -mediated signalling by destabilization of NOD 2 and suggest that TRIM 27 could be a new and promising target for therapeutically intervention in NOD 2 -associated diseases. ...|$|R

Controls were matched to lame cows by parity and stage of lactation. Lame cows suffering from typical sole ulcers or white line disease were blinded and randomly assigned to 2 treatments, receiving 15 min before interventions either ketoprofen (n= 11; 3 mg/kg of BW intramuscularly; Romefen, Merial, Lyon, France) or placebo (n= 10; saline in equivalent amount and route of administration). All cows underwent <b>functional</b> claw <b>trimming</b> in lateral recumbency on a surgical tipping table, and claw horn lesions in lame cows were conventionally treated (removal of loose horn, block on opposing claw, bandaging of affected claw). Blood samples collected 15 min before, at the end, and 24 h after claw trimming were analyzed for concentrations of cortisol, fatty acids, lactate, and glucose, and fecal samples (collected before treatment and after 24 h) for cortisol metabolites. Behavioral stress responses during functional and therapeutic claw trimming were recorded. Concentrations of blood cortisol, fatty acids, glucose, and fecal cortisol metabolites were higher in lame than in nonlame cows after treatment. During claw treatment, more leg movements were recorded for lame cows than nonlame cows. Pre-emptive administration of ketoprofen had no obvious effects on stress responses to therapeutic claw trimming. Treatments of claw horn lesions caused a significant stress and pain reaction in acutely lame cows, demonstrating the necessity of adequate pain management protocols for such interventions...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate claw health in four dairy herds (sizes between 50 and 150 cows) in the north-west of Lower Saxony (Germany) over a period of one year following the introduction of <b>functional</b> claw <b>trimming.</b> Additional to parameters suitable for evaluation of the claw health status (prevalence of claw diseases, severity of lameness), distinct risk indikators concerning the individual animal, the herd and the environment were examined using a modified protocol developed by Nordlund et al. (2004). To this end, the claw diseases that were diagnosed at claw trimming on three different occasions were assigned to, either the complex “infectious diseases”, “laminitis-associated diseases” or “miscellaneous diseases”. Initially, the suitability of the environment was evaluated by using a system to quantify cow-comfort, the Tiergerechtheitsindex TGI 200. Lameness scores were documented in two-week intervals as well as the following risk indicators: Stall Standing Index (SSI), standing time during milking, cud chewing activity, scoring of rumen fill, Body Condition Scoring (BCS). Milkfat-to protein ratio was calculated from the data obtained from the monthly milk recordings. On all four farms the results with respect to the selected risk indicators differed, partially considerably, from the guidelines given in literature. The proportion of lame cows and the severity of lameness as observed in the beginning of the study justified the assignment of the included herds to “herds with a serious lameness problem”. The Tiergerechtheitsindex TGI 200 differed from the guidelines as well as the daily standing time (SSI, standing time at milking) and the rumination activity. With respect to the TGI 200, the main deficits were found in the space allowance and the cubicle comfort, factors that were shown to lead to increased standing times. On all four farms the findings concerning the development of BCS and milk production data did correspond with the nominal values. The introduction of <b>functional</b> claw <b>trimming</b> on all four farms led to a partially significant decrease in the number of cows affected by severe lameness (grade 3 and 4), indicating the benefit of the latter procedure for animal welfare. The prevalence of claw diseases, however, did not change. Improvement of environment on these farms should aim at increasing the room for movement and the cubicle comfort. It is likely that improving cow-comfort in such way that standing times decrease would have a positive effect on claw health by increasing blood circulation in the distal limb. Special attention should be drawed to the heifer management, especially the introduction of highly-pregnant animals into the herd. On the four farms risk indicators which were reported to be related to the ocurrence of claw disorders before differed to a large extent from the given guidelines. This fact demonstrates that these parameters should be taken into consideration for the approach of claw health disorders on dairy farms. However, further research is necessary to develop and improve the employed methods and to establish a suitable system for monotoring claw health which can be used in practice by farmer, clawtrimmer and veterinarian in cooperation. To get generally accepted results the methods have to be tested in case control studies or on farms were the effect of different housing systems can be studied at the same time. The different scoring methods are time-consuming and still do not find the farmers` appreciation. Thus, there is need for further research on the use of innovative measurement technologies and data analysis that aim at automation of the monitoring procedures (e. g. gait analysis by pattern recognition) ...|$|R

Altered TRIM 22 expression levels have also been linked to autoimmune disease, cancer, and cellular proliferation. Despite its important role {{in a number of}} biological processes, the factors that influence TRIM 22 expression and/or antiviral activity remain largely unknown. To identify key <b>functional</b> sites in <b>TRIM</b> 22, we performed extensive evolutionary and in silico analyses on the TRIM 22 coding region. These tools allowed us to pinpoint multiple sites in TRIM 22 that have evolved under positive selection during mammalian evolution, including one site that coincides with the location of a common non-synonymous SNP (nsSNP) in the human TRIM 22 gene (TRIM 22 rs 1063303 :G 3 ̆eC). Remarkably, we found that the frequency of TRIM 22 rs 1063303 :G 3 ̆eC varied considerably among different ethnic populations and African (AFR), American (AMR), and European (EUR) populations contained an excess of intermediate frequency TRIM 22 rs 1063303 :G 3 ̆eC alleles when compared to a neutral model of evolution. The latter is typically indicative of balancing selection, a non-neutral selective process that maintains polymorphism in a population. Interestingly, we also found that the TRIM 22 nsSNP rs 1063303 :G 3 ̆eC had an inverse impact on TRIM 22 function. TRIM 22 rs 1063303 :G 3 ̆eC increased TRIM 22 expression levels, but decreased its anti-HIV activity and altered its subcellular localization pattern. In addition to these studies, we used a variety of in silico methods to prioritize and delineate other <b>functional</b> sites in <b>TRIM</b> 22. We showed that the majority of positively selected sites in the C-terminal B 30. 2 domain of TRIM 22 are located in one of four surface-exposed variable loops that are critical for the anti-HIV effects of the closely-related TRIM 5 α protein. Moreover, we used six different in silico nsSNP prediction programs to screen all of the nsSNPs in the TRIM 22 gene and identified 14 high-risk nsSNPs that are predicted to be highly deleterious to TRIM 22 function. Finally, to examine the TRIM 22 nsSNP rs 1063303 :G 3 ̆eC in a more isolated population, we genotyped this nsSNP in two Inuit populations (Canadian and Greenlandic Inuit). We found that the TRIM 22 rs 1063303 :C allele is inordinately prevalent in the Inuit compared to non-Inuit populations and that these two populations do not contain an excess of intermediate frequency TRIM 22 rs 1063303 :G 3 ̆eC alleles compared to a neutral model of evolution, indicating that site TRIM 22 rs 1063303 :G 3 ̆eC has not evolved under balancing selection in the Inuit. Lastly, we found an interesting association between the TRIM 22 rs 1063303 :C allele and serum levels of triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Taken together, the results presented here identify a number of pertinent sites in the TRIM 22 protein that likely influence its biological and/or antiviral functions...|$|R

[...] University of Washington, 2012 The {{retroviral}} restriction factors TRIM 5 α and TRIMCyp, {{encoded in}} the TRIM 5 gene, prevent cross-species transmission of retroviruses in primates. In macaques (genus Macaca), TRIMCyp evolved through the retrotransposition of a cyclophilin A sequence into the TRIM 5 gene. In this work, I examine the evolutionary origin and geographic distribution of TRIMCyp, and I describe functional variability in both TRIM 5 α and TRIMCyp. I focus on M. sylvanus, {{because of its}} status as an evolutionary outgroup, and on M. fascicularis, which is commonly used as a model species for AIDS research. I show that TRIMCyp evolved approximately 5 - 6 million {{years ago in the}} common ancestor of the Asian macaques, after their divergence from M. sylvanus, and that the genetic changes leading to TRIMCyp expression are variably distributed in M. fascicularis populations. I demonstrate that multiple TRIM 5 α and TRIMCyp alleles, with different antiviral specificities, are present in the M. sylvanus and M. fascicularis populations, respectively.

Furthermore, 54. 95 % (50 / 91) of HNSCC samples exhibited remarkably elevated expression of TRIM 24 by immunohistochemistry. Univariate analysis revealed that high TRIM 24 expression was associated with worse overall survival (P = . 020).

MethodsOne hundred and thirty four, 21 -day-old CD- 1 female mice were divided into two groups: (1) normal loading (hard pellet diet) for 2 – 6 weeks and (2) altered <b>functional</b> loading (incisor <b>trimming</b> every other day and soft dough diet) for 2 – 6 weeks. The mandibular condylar cartilage was evaluated by histology, the subchondral bone was evaluated by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) analysis and gene expression was evaluated by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. ResultsAltered functional loading for 2 – 6 weeks caused significant reduction in the thickness of the condylar cartilage whereas, only at 4 weeks was there a significant decrease in the bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness of the subchondral bone. Gene expression analysis showed that altered functional loading for 4 weeks caused a significant reduction in the expression of SRY-box containing gene 9 (Sox 9), Collagen type X (Col X), Indian hedgehog (Ihh), Collagen type II (Col II) and Vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) and altered loading for 6 weeks caused a significant decrease in the expression of Sox 9, Col II, Vegf and Receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (Rankl) compared to the normal loading group.

So far more than 40 genes have been identified for CMT and the list is estimated to grow by 30 - 50 genes. Whole exome sequencing (WES) is a new next generation sequencing technique, which targets the protein-coding area of the genome. Through WES analysis it is possible to search for disease causing mutations with all kinds of inheritance patterns. Patients suffering from CMT are good candidates for WES analysis because of the genetic heterogeneity of their disease. WES can be used for diagnosing Mendelian disorders with atypical symptoms as well as diseases, which are difficult to confirm using clinical criteria alone and which require costly evaluation, e. g. CMT. In this master study new disease causing mutations for early-onset neuropathies are identified by whole exome sequencing (WES). The aims of this study include using WES for the molecular diagnosis of four patients suffering from early-onset axonal neuropathies, the functional analysis of possible causative variants and improving and developing the process of analyzing variants from whole exome sequencing data, especially the analyzing steps of insertion and deletion variants. Finding causative variants among the insertion and deletion variants has previously been often left out from the WES analysis {{because of the lack of}} systematic analysis technique. As a result of the WES data analysis a new candidate disease gene, tripartite motif containing 2 (TRIM 2) was identified. A missense mutation c. 761 T>A (p. E 254 V) and a deletion c. 1779 delA (p. K 594 Rfs 7 X) were found in patient 2, who suffers from severe CMT type 2. The carrier frequency was analysed to see whether the variants are present in the general population or not. The <b>functional</b> analysis of <b>TRIM</b> 2 was started by preparing constructs carrying the missense mutation and the deletion and by setting up conditions for western blotting...|$|R
40|$|Retroviruses {{possess an}} RNA genome that is reverse {{transcribed}} into DNA and becomes {{integrated into the}} host genome during infection. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV- 1) belongs to the genus lentivirus of the retroviridae family and is a major human pathogen with more than 50 million infected people worldwide to date. Lentiviruses have very narrow host ranges. Cross-species lentiviral transmissions are rare, due {{to the ability of}} mammals to counteract viral infections by the innate immune system, which includes intracellular factors that block virus replication. Of these, the murine protein Fv 1 and the tripartite (RBCC) motif protein family member TRIM 5 α potently inhibit retroviral infections early after virus cell entry. This study presents evidence that antiviral activity exerted by TRIM 5 α is conserved across mammals. Rabbit cells are strongly non-permissive to infections by certain retroviruses including HIV- 1. The study identifies a TRIM 5 α orthologue in rabbits, which possesses antiretroviral activity. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that rabbit TRIM 5 is a true orthologue and clusters with other mammalian TRIM 5 genes. Remarkably, TRIM 5 fusion proteins with the prolyl-peptidyl isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA) have independently evolved twice by retrotransposition of a CypA cDNA into the TRIM 5 genomic locus, generating a viral restriction factor with a CypA binding domain. This study shows that CypA fusion proteins with RBCC domains of other TRIM proteins also function as restriction factors against HIV- 1. Furthermore, fusion of CypA to Fv 1 enables the restriction of HIV- 1 and FIV. Insights into the mechanism of TRIM 5 α restriction are also provided in this study. <b>Functional</b> analyses of <b>TRIM</b> 5 α and TRIMCyp deletion mutants, as well as fusion proteins of Fv 1 Cyp with the TRIM 5 α RING and B-box domains, indicate that the RING and B-box domains mediate the proteasome dependent block to reverse transcription during TRIM 5 α/TRIMCyp restriction. The results suggest that the major antiviral activity exerted by TRIM 5 α is a RING dependent block to reverse transcription, whereas the major activity of TRIMCyp is independent of RING function. ...|$|R
40|$|Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) {{neuropathy}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common forms of inherited peripheral neuropathies with the prevalence of one in 2500 individuals. CMT is phenotypically and genetically a very heterogeneous disease. It can be inherited as an autosomal recessive, dominant or X-linked trait. CMT is characterized by distal muscle weakness, atrophy and deformity of the feet as well as clumsiness of gait. The onset of CMT varies and also the symptoms of the disease can vary even among the members of a single family. So far more than 40 genes have been identified for CMT and the list is estimated to grow by 30 - 50 genes. Whole exome sequencing (WES) is a next generation sequencing technique, which targets the protein coding area of the genome. Through WES analysis it is possible to search for disease causing mutations with all kinds of inheritance patterns. Patients suffering from CMT are good candidates for WES analysis because of the genetic heterogeneity of their disease.

40|$|Dysfunctional {{activity}} of proteins involved in tumour suppressor mechanisms {{can cause the}} neoplastic transformation of a cell. Also, during the initiation and progression of carcinogenesis, plasma protein levels can be altered {{as a result of}} this malignant transformation process. Proteins that have the potential to function as tumour suppressors as well as serve as indicators of malignancy are of key interest in cancer research. Advances in proteomic-based technologies allows for the identification of novel proteins with tumour suppressor properties as well as potential cancer protein biomarkers. Further insight into the functional activities of potential tumour suppressor proteins can also be elucidated through the use of such technologies. Significant advances in cancer research have been gained through studying the dynamic nature of proteins. Recent studies have characterised tripartite motif 16 (TRIM 16), a regulator of the anti-cancer retinoid signalling pathway to act as a potential tumour suppressor protein. Growth inhibitory and apoptotic pathways have been revealed in neuroblastoma and breast cancer cells for the tumour suppressor functions of TRIM 16. Nuclear translocation occurs after the enforced over-expression of TRIM 16 in neuroblastoma cells. Once in the nucleus, via its coiled-coil domain, TRIM 16 interacts and degrades E 2 F 1 levels by decreasing the half-life of this protein. Phenotypic analysis indicated that degradation of E 2 F 1 is required for TRIM 16 mediated growth inhibition of neuroblastoma cancer cells, as the co-over-expression of both TRIM 16 and E 2 F 1 prevented this tumour suppressor effect. Apoptosis is another tumour suppressor function of TRIM 16, where enforced over-expression induced this form of programmed cell death in neuroblastoma and breast cancer cells but not in the non-malignant HEK 293 cells. Characterisation of TRIM 16 induced apoptosis found procaspase- 2 protein levels to significantly increase and decrease in response to the over-expression or knock-down of TRIM 16, respectively. This regulation could occur on a genomic level, as mRNA levels of caspase- 2 were also significantly increased. Albeit, this regulatory relationship was more significantly observed in the breast cancer cells, and to a lesser extent in the neuroblastoma cells, and hence further functional analysis was performed only in the breast cancer cells. Interaction studies found TRIM 16 bound to procaspase- 2 in the cytoplasm, which suggested that protein regulation is direct and transcriptional regulation may be indirect. More importantly, TRIM 16 was able to activate procaspase- 2, as Western analysis showed an increase in the active forms of caspase- 2 and activity assays indicated a 2 -fold increase in caspase- 2 activity. Increased {{activity of}} caspase- 2 by TRIM 16 caused the depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the subsequent release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Inhibition of caspase- 2 activity suggests that the activation of caspase- 2 and the depolarisation of mitochondria are essential processes in TRIM 16 induced apoptosis. A majority of the functions of TRIM 16 appear to occur through protein-protein interactions. Thus, with a yeast-two hybrid assay, an additional nine novel protein candidates were identified to interact with TRIM 16. From the list of candidates, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP 43) was selected and then validated to interact with TRIM 16 in both neuroblastoma and breast cancer cells. TRIM 16 also positively regulated the protein levels of TDP 43, where TRIM 16 was able to enhance and increase the half-life of the TDP 43 protein. A functional relationship of the interaction was also observed, where TRIM 16 required TDP 43 to inhibit growth and decrease the proliferation rate of the cancer cells. Other cell cycle regulatory proteins E 2 F 1 and pRb, previously identified to be degraded and dephosphorylated by TRIM 16, respectively, also required the expression of TDP 43. Protein-protein interactions studies suggested that the growth inhibitory effects of TRIM 16 are a part of a complex interaction network. Plasma proteins can represent abnormally expressed or discarded proteins from cancer cells or other organs and tissues affected by malignancy. Detection of the differences between the protein levels of normal and malignant states can be analysed by a label-free approach through the use of mass spectrometry and quantification programs, such as Progenesis LC-MS. Using this approach a number of potential neuroblastoma-specific protein biomarkers were identified from the plasma of tumour bearing TH-MYCN homozygous mice. Approximately 200 proteins per genotype per time-point were found to be at differentially abundant levels in the plasma of TH-MYCN homozygous and wild-type mice. Filtering this data produced a refined list of 90 protein candidates. Further refinement allowed for a list of 20 biomarker candidates. From this list, zinc-alpha 2 -glycoprotein (ZAG), and complement C 3 (C 3), have been validated to be differentially abundant by using 2 DE and ELISA techniques. Although verification is needed using human plasma samples, this technique has described a novel means of identifying potential neuroblastoma biomarker candidates. From this research the <b>functional</b> properties of <b>TRIM</b> 16 as tumour suppressor protein have been further characterised. Regulatory pathways of TRIM 16 in cell cycle control and apoptosis in cancer cells have been elucidated. Also, novel protein candidates that interact with TRIM 16 have been identified. This study has also identified potential plasma protein biomarkers that could be used to accurately detect neuroblastoma. Thus, the importance of proteomics in cancer research has been emphasised...|$|R
40|$|A {{cohort study}} was {{performed}} on 150 HF X Black Pied crossbred dairy cattle in order to compare the effects of rubber flooring and solid concrete floors on claw horn quality, horn growth and wear, net growth, lameness and claw health. To this end on a dairy farm with 628 dairy cattle one of two identical buildings was established with rubber flooring (KURA P®, Gummiwerk Kraiburg Elastik GmbH, Tittmoning/ Obb.). After calving the animals were either assigned to the group housed in the building with rubber flooring or the building with solid concrete floors. No differences existed {{between the two groups}} with respect to hygiene management and food and water supply. Approximately two weeks before calving heifers were transported to the dairy farm from a rearing farm, where the latter animals had been kept solely on straw bedding. In contrast, the dairy cows of the second and higher lactations on the farm already had a history of being kept alternately on free stalls with concrete flooring or straw bedding. The observation period lasted 15 weeks for single animals being kept either on rubber flooring or solid concrete floors. It started with <b>functional</b> claw <b>trimming.</b> At claw-trimming {{and at the end of}} the observational period documentation of claw lesions using the DLG-Score took place and horn samples were obtained from the sole segment of the right lateral hind claw, which were examined by light microscopy. The number of horn tubules per mm², the diameter of the horn tubules as well as the relation between the area of the marrow zone and the cortex of the different tubules were determined. In addition net horn growth was determined from wear and growth characteristics of the claw horn at the dorsal wall. Lameness scoring (Sprecher et al., 1997) took place in two-week intervals. Claw health was evaluated by recording new cases of claw disorders that had occurred during the observation period and the cure rate. The number of horn tubules per mm² of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle ranged from 22 to 28, 34 to 40, 39 to 44, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors compared to 31 to 33, 33 to 39, 35 to 46, respectively on solid concrete floors. At the end of the observation period the number of horn tubules for calved heifers kept on rubber flooring was lower than for the same group of animals kept on solid concrete floors. As the number of horn tubules is genetically fixed, the lower number of horn tubules in the group housed on rubber was thought to be the consequence of a higher water content of the horn located between the tubules leading to larger distances between the single horn tubules. The latter effect was not observed in animals with lactation numbers of two and higher. Horn from the sole segment of animals of the first lactation belonging either to the group kept on rubber or on solid concrete floors had lower numbers of horn tubules than cattle of lactation two and higher. The diameter of horn tubules of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle ranged from 76 µm to 78 µm, 58 µm to 62 µm, 62 µm to 62 µm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors compared to 61 µm to 63 µm, 51 µm to 51 µm, 47 µm to 50 µm, respectively on solid concrete floors. With respect to the diameter of horn tubules no differences were observed between cattle kept on rubber floors or solid concrete floors. In addition there were no significant changes in the relation between the areas of the marrow zone to the cortex of the horn tubules between the two groups. The diameter of horn tubules being larger for cattle of the first lactation in either group suggests that the animals have also larger dermal papillae. The relation between the area of the marrow zone and the cortex of the different tubules ranged from 1. 74 to 1. 90, 1. 91 to 1. 87, 1. 69 to 1. 77, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors compared to 1. 93 to 2. 00, 1. 96 to 2. 14, 1. 91 to 2. 00, respectively on solid concrete floors. With respect to the relation between the area of the marrow zone and the cortex of the different tubules no differences were observed between cattle kept on rubber floors or solid concrete floors. The monthly horn growth of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle were 4. 4 mm, 3. 9 mm, 3. 7 mm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors versus 4. 7 mm, 4. 1 mm, 3. 7 mm, respectively on solid concrete floors. The monthly horn wear of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle were 1. 8 mm, 0. 5 mm, 0. 5 mm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors versus 2. 5 mm, 0. 7 mm, 0. 6 mm, respectively on solid concrete floors. This results in a monthly net horn growth of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle of 2. 5 mm, 3. 5 mm, 3. 2 mm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors versus 2. 2 mm, 3. 4 mm, 3. 2 mm, respectively on solid concrete floors. Animals of the first lactation showed slightly smaller amounts of horn growth and horn wear compared to older animals. However, net horn growth did not differ between animals kept on rubber flooring versus solid concrete floors. The small amount of horn wear on solid concrete floors might be related to a lack of exercise of the animals due to the slippery solid concrete floors. The latter is also reflected in the net growth rates of claw horn of animals on concrete flooring being more than 3 mm/month. Net horn growth of the bulb of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle were 2. 0 mm, 2. 2 mm, 2. 1 mm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors versus 1. 5 mm, 1. 6 mm, 2. 1 mm, respectively on solid concrete floors. There were no differences observed with respect to the flooring types. The prevalence of lameness ranged from 14 % to 31 % (rubber floors) and 28 % to 42 % (solid concrete floors). They did not differ in the two groups at any date of observation. In addition, no differences were observed with respect to lactation numbers. The prevalence of laminitis-associated disorders were already high at the start of the observational period (1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd or higher lactation: 71 %, 87 %, 87 % (rubber floors); 90 %, 99 %, 99 % (solid concrete floors). After 15 weeks laminitis-associated disorders were observed in nearly all claws. Defects of the white line (WLD), sole haemorrhages and double soles were the most prominent lesions observed in this context. There was no difference found with respect to the occurrence of new cases of defects of the white line and sole haemorrhages between the two groups, however the cure rate of the latter diseases was higher for animals of the third and higher lactation that were kept on rubber floors. In addition, the latter effect was also observed for defects of the white line and haemorrhages of animals of the first lactation kept on rubber flooring. Based on the latter findings the conclusion can be drawn that the type flooring does not lead to a reduction in cases of subclinical laminitis which might have been caused by fermentation disorders, but rubber flooring seems to enhance the process of recovery. The occurrence of new cases and the cure rates of double soles, slurry heel, digital dermatitis and interdigital dermatitis were not affected by the type of flooring. Animals of the first lactation that were kept on rubber floors had a smaller number of lesions related to dermatitis digitalis. The following conclusions can be drawn from the results of the study: Claw horn quality of rubber flooring dairy cattle does not differ from cattle kept on solid concrete floors. Net growth of dairy cattle kept on rubber floors is not higher as net growth of dairy cattle kept on slippery solid concrete floors. Prevalence of lameness does not differ between cattle kept on rubber or solid concrete floors. Keeping cattle on rubber floors does not lead to a better claw health if management based problems such moisture of alleys, bad stall comfort or feeding are not previously solved...|$|R
