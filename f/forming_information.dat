Aniket Kittur, Bongowon Suh, and Ed H.

40|$|Pseudocoloring for {{presenting}} univariate {{map information}} on a graphic display system is investigated. The kinds of information available in maps are divided into two classes: metric information denotes the quantity stored at each point on the surface, and <b>form</b> <b>information</b> denotes the shape or structure of the surface. Theoretical principles are proposed to predict which color sequences will be effective at conveying value and <b>form</b> <b>information</b> respectively. According to this theory, a scale that approximates the physical spectrum should be good at conveying value information, because of the reduced effects of simultaneous contrast. It should be poor at conveying <b>form</b> <b>information,</b> however, because the brain prefers <b>form</b> <b>information</b> {{to come through the}} lightness-processing channel. Conversely, a gray scale should be poor at conveying value information and good at conveying <b>form</b> <b>information,</b> according to the same theory. These predictions are tested in a series of psychophysical experiments that test five color sequences. The results show that simultaneous contrast can be a major source of error when reading maps, but only partially confirm the form hypothesis. Guidelines are given for designing color sequences to be effective in both conveying <b>form</b> and value <b>information.</b> An experimental color sequence is presented to illustrate these guidelines...|$|R

40|$|Psycholinguistic {{evidence}} suggests that people predict upcoming words during language comprehension. While many studies have addressed what information people predict, less {{is known about the}} role of factors that potentially mediate predictive processing. This thesis examines predictions of semantic <b>information</b> and word <b>form</b> <b>information.</b> It investigates whether predictive processing is mediated by availability of cognitive resources and time to generate predictions, and compares predictive processing in native (L 1) speakers and non-native (L 2) speakers. This thesis presents two major lines of work. Two eye-tracking studies investigate prediction of semantic and word <b>form</b> <b>information</b> using a visual world paradigm. In further two ERP studies, we address the interplay of semantic and word <b>form</b> <b>information</b> in a paradigm which combines both possibilities. Experiments 1 and 2 were an eye-tracking study conducted on L 1 and L 2 speakers of English. The study has demonstrated that L 1 and L 2 speakers predict semantic information, but their predictive eye movements are delayed when they are under a cognitive load. The effects of cognitive load on predictive eye movements suggest a role of cognitive resources in language prediction in both L 1 and L 2 speakers. Experiments 3 and 4 were another eye-tracking study conducted on L 1 and L 2 speakers. The study has shown that L 1 speakers predict word <b>form</b> <b>information,</b> but L 2 speakers do not. Experiments 5 and 6 were an ERP study, which investigated the interplay of prediction of semantic and word <b>form</b> <b>information</b> in L 1 English speakers. Consistent with the two sets of eye-tracking experiments, L 1 speakers predicted both semantic and word <b>form</b> <b>information,</b> but word <b>form</b> was only predicted when sentences were presented at a slower rate, while semantic information was predicted at standard and slow presentation rates. Experiments 7 and 8 used the same method as Experiments 5 and 6, conducted on L 2 English speakers. L 2 speakers comprehended sentences incrementally, but there was no clear evidence that they predicted semantic <b>information</b> or word <b>form</b> <b>information.</b> Experiments 5 – 8 suggest that prediction of word <b>form</b> <b>information</b> is mediated both by nativeness of the target language and by reading rates. To conclude, both L 1 and L 2 speakers make predictions, but prediction of semantic information occurs only when there are enough cognitive resources available. Prediction of word form can occur in L 1 speakers, but it occurs only when there is enough time available. There is no evidence that L 2 speakers predict word form, suggesting a role of nativeness of the target language. The findings are consistent with the production-based prediction model of language prediction, in that prediction of word form is less likely to occur compared to prediction of semantic information. Furthermore, the findings are also consistent with the claim that not everyone makes predictions, and predictions do not always occur. The thesis concludes that prediction is additional processing for the comprehension system, and is not always implicated in the comprehension system...|$|R

40|$|Form {{and motion}} {{processing}} pathways of the primate visual system {{are known to}} be interconnected, but there has been surprisingly little investigation of how they interact at the cellular level. Here we explore this issue with a series of three electrophysiology experiments designed to reveal the sources of action selectivity in monkey temporal cortex neurons. Monkeys discriminated between actions performed by complex, richly textured, rendered bipedal figures and hands. The firing patterns of neurons contained enough information to discriminate the identity of the character, the action performed, and the particular conjunction of action and character. This suggests convergence of motion and <b>form</b> <b>information</b> within single cells. <b>Form</b> and motion <b>information</b> in isolation were both sufficient to drive action discrimination within these neurons, but removing <b>form</b> <b>information</b> caused a greater disruption to the original response. Finally, we investigated the temporal window across which visual information is integrated into a single pose (or, equivalently, the timing with which poses are differentiated). Temporal cortex neurons under normal conditions represent actions as sequences of poses integrated over � 120 ms.

The authors start by reflecting on formative developments in information literacy outside North America in the late 1990 s-early 2000 s, and noting that IL has not evolved from that period as much as one might expect.

The authors present ‘Information Literacy in the lifecourse’ as an example focus which could stimulate engagement from researchers and practitioners who are currently situated in different information literacy silos. They conclude that taking a disciplinary and lifecourse approach to information literacy would open up opportunities for working in a collegiate way, both within the information literacy community and with those outside it, and provide a more robust foundation for influencing policy. ...|$|E

The author investigates the possibility that courts are influenced in thein decision making by the general public, the opinion of which is shaped mostly by mass media outlets which unfortunately often release speculations as proven facts.

These factors have led to an increase in the demand for safety-related PLCs. The complexity and size of the software-based control applications grows and so does the importance to be able to produce safe software code. The requirements for machine safety posed by the national and international laws are intricate and many industrial standards have been formed to facilitate designing machinery that meet these requirements. This thesis concentrates on these standards and the recommendation and requirements they pose on safety analysis, design process, operating systems, tools and programming languages. 	Through charting various safety-related requirements it becomes clear that compared to non-safety-related projects, safety-related projects require many times more documentation on made design choices, analysis and implementations.
