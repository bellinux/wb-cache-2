40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{the number of}} men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with {{men and women who are}} HIV-positive in the United States, and to compare HIV prevalence rates between men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men and women, men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men only, and men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with women exclusively. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of reports referencing HIV prevalence and men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men and women. We searched PubMed and Ovid PsycINFO for peer-reviewed, U. S. -based articles reporting on HIV prevalence among men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men and women. We conducted event rate, effect size, moderation and sensitivity analyses. Results: We estimate that 1. 0 % of U. S. males are bisexually-behaving, and that 121, 800 bisexually-behaving men are HIV-positive. Men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men and women are less than half as likely to be HIV-positive as men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men only (16. 9 % vs. 33. 3 %; OR = 0. 41, 95 % CI: 0. 31, 0. 54), but more than five times as likely to be HIV-positive as men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with women exclusively (18. 3 % vs. 3. 5 %; OR = 5. 71, 95 % CI: 3. 47, 9. 39). They are less likely to engage in unprotected receptive anal intercourse than men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men only (15. 9 % vs. 35. 0 %; OR = 0. 36, 95 % CI: 0. 28, 0. 46). Men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men and women in samples with high racial/ethnic minority proportions had significantly higher HIV prevalence than their counterparts in low racial/ethnic minority samples. Conclusions: This represents the first meta-analysis of HIV prevalence in the U. S. between men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men and women and men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men only. Data collection, research, and HIV prevention and care delivery specifically tailored to men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men and women are necessary to better quantify and ameliorate this population's HIV burden.

40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} shown there has been {{significant}} {{lack of knowledge about}} women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with women cross infect each other with STIs. It has been less likely that women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with women visit health care than heterosexuals, they often felt badly treated, invisible and did not always know where to turn in case of an STI. Objective: The objective was to examine if STI information from Kalmar and VÃ¤xjÃ¶ county websites and GCK-summit, targeted women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with women. Method: With a queer theoretical perspective a critical discourse analysis was made by STI information on the internet. Results: Women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with women <b>have</b> been excluded in the STI information currently available through Kalmar and VÃ¤xjÃ¶ county websites. The public notices for screening tests have not been designed in such way it includes women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with women. Women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with women <b>have</b> been an obscure group. Conclusion: The conclusion was that women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with women <b>have</b> not been included in the STI information available on the internet within the county councils of Kalmar and Kronoberg...|$|R
40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} To explore men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men's views about condom use when having anal intercourse. Background Internationally, health promotion campaigns use behavioural change strategies to support men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men to always use condoms when <b>having</b> anal <b>sex</b> with other men. The health promotion message given {{to this group}} is consistent and explicitly stated that âuse a condom every time for anal sex regardless of relationship statusâ. Design Qualitative analysis of data from a cohort of New Zealand men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men. Methods A total of 960 useable questionnaires were completed: 571 online and 389 in hard copy. Qualitative data were analysed using a thematic data analytic process. Results Three themes relating to condom use in men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men were identified. These are as follows: âSafer sex is good sexâ, âCondom use is good but â¦â and âI use condoms sometimesâ. Conclusions The range of responses towards condom use for anal sex in men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men in our sample reveal this as a complex public health issue, with not all men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men willing to consistently use condoms. Relevance to clinical practice It is important that nurses do not assume that all men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men are willing to use condoms for anal sex, and should create opportunities for men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men to raise any concerns {{about the use of}} condoms. In this way, nurses can assist in providing information that may help men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men to make decisions that will minimise risk of contracting infections associated with sexual activity...|$|R
