FBI investigators used the resulting information gained, along with the fake address McVeigh had been using, to begin their search for the Nichols brothers, Terry and James. On April 21, 1995, Terry Nichols learned {{that he was being}} hunted, and turned himself in. Investigators discovered incriminating evidence at his home: ammonium nitrate and blasting caps, the electric drill used to <b>drill</b> <b>out</b> the locks at the quarry, books on bomb-making, a copy of Hunter (a 1989 novel by William Luther Pierce, the founder and chairman of the National Alliance, a white nationalist group) and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City, on which the Murrah Building and the spot where McVeigh's getaway car was hidden were marked. After a nine-hour interrogation, Terry Nichols was formally held in federal custody until his trial. On April 25, 1995, James Nichols was also arrested, but he was released after 32days due to lack of evidence. McVeigh's sister Jennifer was accused of illegally mailing bullets to McVeigh, but she was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against him.|$|E

50|$|Gun {{drilling}} {{was originally}} developed to <b>drill</b> <b>out</b> gun barrels {{and is used}} commonly for drilling smaller diameter deep holes. The depth-to-diameter ratio can be even greater than 300:1. The key feature of gun drilling is that the bits are self-centering; this is what allows for such deep accurate holes. The bits use a rotary motion similar to a twist drill; however, the bits are designed with bearing pads that slide along {{the surface of the}} hole keeping the drill bit on center. Gun drilling is usually done at high speeds and low feed rates.|$|E

5000|$|Tooth-sparing preparation: The {{fact that}} {{composite}} fillings are glued (bonded) to the tooth means that unlike amalgam fillings, {{there is no}} need for the dentist to create retentive features destroying healthy tooth. Unlike amalgam, which just fills a hole and relies on the geometry of the hole to retain the filling, composite materials are bonded to the tooth. In order to achieve the necessary geometry to retain an amalgam filling, the dentist may need to <b>drill</b> <b>out</b> a significant amount of healthy tooth material. In the case of a composite restoration, the geometry of the hole (or [...] "box") is less important because a composite filling bonds to the tooth. Therefore less healthy tooth needs to be removed for a composite restoration.|$|E

5000|$|The {{definition}} of failure applied in clinical studies {{may affect the}} reported statistics. Demarco et al note: [...] "Failed restorations or restorations presenting small defects are routinely treated by replacement by most clinicians. Because of this, for many years, the replacement of defective restorations has been reported as the most common treatment in general dental practice..." [...] Demarco et al observe that when both repaired and replaced restorations were classified as failures in one study, the Annual Failure Rate was 1.9%. However, when repaired restorations were reclassified as successes instead of failures, the AFR decreased to 0.7%. Reclassifying repairable minor defects as successes rather than failures is justifiable: [...] "When a restoration is replaced, {{a significant amount of}} sound tooth structure is removed and the preparation hole is enlarged". Applying the narrower {{definition of}} failure would improve the reported longevity of composite restorations: Composite restorations can often be easily repaired or extended without drilling out and replacing the entire filling. Resin composites will adhere to the tooth and to undamaged prior composite material. In contrast, amalgam fillings are held in place by the shape of the void being filled rather than by adhesion. This means that it is often necessary to <b>drill</b> <b>out</b> and replace an entire amalgam restoration rather than add to the remaining amalgam.|$|E

40|$|In {{teaching}} young children, {{teachers need}} to apply appropriate techniques in order that the children can absorb the topic {{as much as their}} brain capacity can do. Thus, the writer was interested to study on how teachers in an English course apply the techniques based on the topics. This study is done to find out the techniques which are used by the teachers and how techniques are adjusted to the kind of topics. This study has been conducted in CLT (an English course) who have children classes. There were 13 teachers who became the respondents and filled out the questionnaire constructed based on the observation. The result shows that there were 13 techniques applied by teachers to teach young learners. Five techniques are major and eight are additional techniques. The major techniques are pictures, <b>drill</b> <b>out,</b> repetition, role play, and theory exposition. On the other hand, pattern or formula, electronic media, game, real object, survey, card, song, and rhyme were additional techniques. In adjusting the techniques, teachers refer to the kinds of topics. They use the techniques based on the kinds of topics. When they teach vocabulary, they use more pictures. However, they also mix it with repetition ad <b>drill</b> <b>out.</b> When the topic is grammar, they use theory exposition and drill more. Role play is used more frequently when teaching functions...|$|E

This proves the Marden’s conjecture. Our approach is to form an exhaustion Mi of M and modify the boundary to make them 2 -convex. We use the induced path-metric, which makes the submanifold Mi δ-hyperbolic and with Margulis constants independent of i. By taking the convex hull in the cover of Mi corresponding the core, we show that there exists an exiting sequence of surfaces Σi. We <b>drill</b> <b>out</b> the covers of Mi by a core C again to make it δ-hyperbolic. Then the boundary of the convex hull of Σi is shown to meet the core.
