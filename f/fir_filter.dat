INTRODUCTION A fair amount of attention has been focused on the design of non-symmetric digital <b>FIR</b> <b>filters.</b> Laakso et al. discuss in [6] the design of non-symmetric <b>FIR</b> <b>filters</b> for fractional delay applications.

40|$|A novel {{low-power}} synthesis {{technique is}} presented {{for the design}} of folded or time-multiplexed programmable-coefficient <b>FIR</b> <b>filters</b> where storage area is traded-off for lowering power consumption. A systematic technique is developed for low power mapping of <b>FIR</b> <b>filters</b> to architectures with arbitrary number of multipliers and adders. Power consumed in multipliers is reduced by reducing switching activity at both the data-input as well as the coefficient input. Common input operands can be exposed by unfolding, which, however leads to a memory increase. Simulation results are obtained for folding 65 and 129 tap bandpass <b>FIR</b> <b>filters.</b> The average power consumed in a multiplier for a fixed number of hardware multipliers with varying unfolding factors is compared. It is observed that most of the gains due to unfolding are obtained for relatively small unfolding factors and therefore for relatively small memory area overhead. Depending on the unfolding factor employed the average power consumed in a multiplier is seen to reduce anywhere from 54. 75 % to 81. 73 % when transpose <b>FIR</b> <b>filters</b> are synthesized as opposed to synthesizing direct-form <b>FIR</b> <b>filters</b> with no unfolding. 1...|$|R
40|$|This thesis proposes {{the use of}} a Systolic Array of Multi-Rate <b>FIR</b> <b>Filters</b> {{to improve}} {{performance}} by eliminating the requirement of the FFT and De-Multiplexer associated with the conventional receiver while achieving the same functionality. The FFT is a major bottle neck for improving system performance for the conventional DCWBR because many complex multiplications and additions are required. The proposed new architecture is designed and evaluated in MATLAB to illustrate its viability. Two approaches for improved channel arbitration are accessed in MATLAB, namely, channel bin’s rms comparison and parallelism of the Systolic Array Multi-Rate <b>FIR</b> <b>Filters.</b> The <b>FIR</b> <b>filters</b> (high-pass 2 ̆ 6 low-pass) were successfully designed with Cadence tools using 0. 13 um technology and are fully functional at clock frequencies up to 1. 8 GHz.

Nevertheless, a two tier tree of Multi-Rate <b>FIR</b> <b>filters</b> demonstrated channelization in cadence (simulations which can be completed within the constraints of computing facilities) and is consistent with those of MATLAB; thus, proving the viability of using the Systolic Array of Multi-Rate <b>FIR</b> <b>Filters</b> as a potential architecture for improving performance of DCWBR...|$|R
