40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to gain an {{understanding}} of the distribution of glycogen concentrations and ultimate pH (pHu) in 2 different muscle types for lambs slaughtered under commercial conditions in Western Australia, and to compare muscle glycogen concentrations in lambs on farm and after slaughter. The study included 13 different consignments of prime lambs from a range of commercial scenarios. <b>In</b> each <b>consignment,</b> muscle glycogen concentration was measured in a group of lambs on farm and subsequently after slaughter in 3 different lairage groups. The lairage groups were: slaughter on arrival (no lairage), slaughter after 1 day, and slaughter after 2 days in lairage. Biopsies of M. semimembranosus and the M. semitendinosus were taken from live lambs on farm just before farm curfew before transport and from carcasses immediately after slaughter. There was a significant effect of consignment on muscle glycogen concentration. Muscle glycogen concentrations on farm were lower than 1 g/ 100 g <b>in</b> 4 <b>consignments</b> for the M. semimembranosus and 11 consignments for the M. semitendinosus. The cause of the differences between consignments was unclear as nutrition, genotype and age class were confounded between consignments. Glycogen concentrations were lower and meat pHu higher for sucker lamb compared with carry-over lamb consignments. However, lambs finished on grain-based feedlot rations had higher muscle glycogen concentrations than lambs finished on pasture and sucker lambs when finished on pastures only. Sucker lambs were only crossbred while carry-over lambs included crossbred and Merino genotypes. When data from different consignments were pooled and the effect of consignment was considered, there were no differences between muscle glycogen concentration measured on farm and muscle glycogen concentration measured after slaughter. However, there were differences between sample times within individual consignments. Glycogen concentration at slaughter was different from glycogen concentration on farm <b>in</b> more <b>consignments</b> for M. semitendinosus than M. semimembranosus, suggesting a difference between consignments for the effect caused by stress. Typically, the M. semimembranosus glycogen concentration at slaughter was lower than on farm <b>in</b> <b>consignments</b> consisting of Merino genotypes that had high muscle glycogen concentrations on farm. <b>In</b> the <b>consignments</b> <b>in</b> which lairage time had an effect on muscle glycogen concentration, the differences were small. <b>In</b> some <b>consignments</b> a difference occurred between lairage times for pHu without any difference occurring for muscle glycogen concentration...|$|R

The consignor retains title to the item and can end the arrangement at any time by requesting its return. A specified time is commonly arranged after which if the item does not sell, the owner is expected to reclaim it (if it is not reclaimed within a specified period, the seller can dispose of the item at discretion).|$|E

The EFSA Panel on Plant Health acknowledges the responses provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and considers that the USDA misinterpreted the conclusions made by the Panel in its previous opinion (EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH), 2011). The Panel considers that the extrapolations of the data provided by Shiotani et al. (2009) and Gottwald et al. (2009) were not supported by sound evidence. The Panel considers that both the responses provided by Dr Shiotani and by Dr Gottwald and colleagues do not lead to any major change in the set of scientifically sound information related to citrus canker and Xanthomonas citri pv. citri.

40|$|Although it is {{regarded}} as an important focus of brown crab Cancer pagurus landings, the fishery in south east Ireland is poorly documented and the official statistics are believed to under-record the species {{by a factor of}} 2 - 3. This appraisal of the south east Ireland brown crab fishery is based on > 22, 000 records of sales transactions from the 1990 s and a comparison of the biological characteristics of landings in the late 1960 s with thirty years later, in the context of increasing fishing effort. The three buyers who gave access to their books inwards for periods of the 1990 s, purchase from the same fishing community and they compete for product but they occupy slightly different market niches: a vivier truck operator exports to Spain, a processor concentrates on autumn purchases of female crab for vacuum packing while the third buys crab claws for human consumption and crab bodies which are used as bait for whelk Buccinum undatum. Only the first sales of crab from 55 km of coastline are considered. In this area fishing effort doubled between 1972 and 1988 but expansion accelerated in the following decade by at least 128 %; a single operator increased his effort by 80 % between 1988 and 1998. In the 30 years after 1968, the number of pots per km of coastline rose by 241 %. The sale of brown crab is recorded in consignments which are raised to live weights in the analysis. Consignment size fell steeply in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s after which it stabilised; adjusting the figures to allow for increasing effort accentuated the trend; at the same time consignment number rose. Allowing that a decline <b>in</b> <b>consignment</b> size was accompanied by an increase in pot number, consignment number should have risen by 310 % to maintain landings at the level recorded in 1990; the largest recorded increase <b>in</b> <b>consignment</b> number was by 230 % and while it is accepted that all sales transactions have not been obtained, it is likely that LPUE has been declining over the 1990 s in real terms in this fishery. Increasing fishing effort during that time is seen as a product of better technology, stimulated by a desire to compensate for falling LPUE. Comparison of size and sex composition of the landings recorded in the late 1960 s and the late 1990 s are inconclusive. Depth of water and type of substratum are likely to influence the composition of inshore landings. An argument is presented that the south east inshore crab fishery is fully or over-exploited. It is likely to have an offshore component and such occasional data as are available on brown crab further south suggest that the offshore is an under-exploited fishery. In which case, the rate of interchange between the two components is likely to be crucial to the continued performance of the inshore fisheryFunder: Marine Institut...|$|E
