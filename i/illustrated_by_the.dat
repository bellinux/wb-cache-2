Some mixed-valence compounds are also known, such as Tl4O3 and TlCl2, which contain both thallium(I) and thallium(III). Thallium(III) oxide, Tl2O3, is a black solid which decomposes above 800°C, forming the thallium(I) oxide and oxygen.|$|E

5|$|The great {{significance}} {{of religion in}} the culture of Roman Switzerland is <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> imposing size and central location of the Roman temples in the cities, {{as well as by the}} great number of religious artifacts found by archaeologists.

5|$|This kind {{of combat}} was {{consistent}} with the aim of minimising casualties and its efficacy is <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Strasbourg. The battle was primarily a struggle of attrition where steady pressure on the barbarians resulted in their eventual rout.

5|$|As <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{table of}} matches above, {{little is known}} of {{organised}} cricket to 1725 {{because of the lack}} of newspaper coverage. The shortage of references in the latter part of the 17th century is due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry. Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries. It follows that equally little is known of clubs and teams, players and locations.|$|E

The book tells a {{slightly}} fictionalized {{account of the}} Bone Wars, a period of intense excavation, speculation, and rivalry {{which led to a}} greater understanding of dinosaurs in the western United States. This novel is the first semi-fictional work written by Ottaviani; previously, he had taken no creative license with the characters he depicted, portraying them strictly according to historical sources.|$|E
5|$|California was {{recorded}} at Foxy Studios between January and March 2016 with Feldmann. He was the group's first new producer since longtime collaborator Jerry Finn. Prior to his involvement, the trio began writing together in September 2015 and completed dozens of songs. They decided to shelve them upon working with Feldmann to start fresh, and they proceeded to record another 28 songs; in all, the group recorded upwards of 50. The band, {{as well as}} Feldmann, would regularly spend 18 hours in the studio a day, aiming to start and complete multiple songs in that timeframe. The album's title comes from the band's home state of California, and its artwork was <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> street artist D*Face.|$|E

The individual chapters were collected and published in 12 tankōbon volumes by Kodansha from November 1996 to July 2000. Kodansha released the first six volumes in bilingual editions that included both Japanese and English from May 2000 to July 2001.

Relationships became increasingly factional, as <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> failure of three directors, including the club's de facto chief executive Panos Pavlakis, to gain re-election, followed the next day by their reinstatement. On 17 February, the board voluntarily appointed receivers from accountants Ernst & Young to take over management of the company. Their statement stressed that no winding-up petition had been issued and the company was not in liquidation.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was {{merged into}} the Chessie System, which planned to close and abandon the South Branch line. The Romney spur through Depot Valley {{remained}} in service and was <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> United States Geological Survey on its 1973 Romney Quadrangle topographic map. On October 11, 1978, the Chessie System transferred {{ownership of the}} South Branch line to the South Branch Valley Railroad, which in turn was {{owned and operated by}} the West Virginia State Rail Authority. During this transition, the Romney spur of the South Branch Valley Railroad was abandoned, after which all rail and commercial activity at Valley ceased.|$|E

Paleontologist Donald Prothero noted that this is <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that the number of species known through the fossil record was less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all the species that have ever lived.|$|E
