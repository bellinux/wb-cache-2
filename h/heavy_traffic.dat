5|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>Traffic</b> is a 1973 American adult {{animated}} comedy-drama film {{written and}} directed by Ralph Bakshi. The film, which begins, ends, and occasionally combines with live-action, explores the often surreal fantasies of a young New York cartoonist named Michael Corleone, using pinball imagery as a metaphor for inner-city life. <b>Heavy</b> <b>Traffic</b> was Bakshi and producer Steve Krantz's follow-up to the film Fritz the Cat. Though producer Krantz made varied attempts to produce an R-rated film, <b>Heavy</b> <b>Traffic</b> was given an X rating by the MPAA. The film received positive reviews and is widely considered to be Bakshi's biggest critical success.|$|E

50|$|Rural {{grants to}} enable a {{particular}} road to be repaired. These grants were mostly {{made in the}} 14th century, and largely for the great roads radiating from London, which were presumably those carrying the <b>heaviest</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1994, the {{overpass}} {{bridge over}} Pottery Road, {{north of the}} Bayview/Bloor interchange was rebuilt. It was over 30 years old and it required the replacement of columns and a restructuring of the deck. It was worn down due to {{the cumulative effect of}} <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic</b> and weather. The replacement necessitated the closure of several lanes of the parkway from April until the autumn that year.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, ambulances can be fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles {{to the presence}} of an ambulance before they can be seen. The first audible warnings were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the ambulance. Most modern ambulances are now fitted with electronic sirens, producing a range of different noises which ambulance operators can use to attract more attention to themselves, particularly when proceeding through an intersection or in <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{originally}} {{started as}} a massive loop around the Chicago area, however it has retained its current, much shorter route ever since 1937. During the 1990s, it {{became the subject of}} much concern for local residents regarding expansion which slowed down any progress for capacity improvement. By the late 2000s, the delays have come and gone and it has emerged as a state route that has been largely modernized to deal with <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
50|$|Between 2001 and 2007 the {{interchange}} {{as well as}} {{the tunnel}} were completely remediated so they could better handle the <b>heavier</b> <b>traffic.</b> Due to the remediation of the tunnel they had to close the A1 for three months.|$|R
50|$|A {{feeder line}} is a {{peripheral}} route or branch in a network, which connects smaller or more remote nodes with a route or branch carrying <b>heavier</b> <b>traffic.</b> The term is applicable to any system based on a hierarchical network.|$|R

5|$|On {{the weekend}} of August17–18, 2009, another serious traffic jam occurred, in which it took some drivers two hours {{to get to the}} Thruway from the mall. Officials cited several factors: the <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic</b> on Route17 that weekend for both the 40th anniversary of the Woodstock Music Festival in Sullivan County and the observances of the anniversary of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum's death in Kiryas Joel, a few miles to the west. A traffic light that had been {{malfunctioning}} after a recent lightning strike may also have contributed.|$|E
5|$|Shenandoah Valley and Newtown's central {{location}} attracted <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic</b> through the region, and wagon-making {{emerged as an}} important industry for the town; Newtown artisans supplied wagons throughout the state. By 1830, the town's population had reached 800. In the late 1850s, free blacks began a settlement about a mile east of town which became known as Crossroads or Freetown, which lasted until {{the time of the}} American Civil War. After the January 1, 1863, Emancipation Proclamation, most of the newly freed slaves and many of the already free blacks left the area.|$|E
50|$|The {{new road}} bridge, {{constructed}} in 1995 {{parallel to the}} old bridge, accommodates far <b>heavier</b> <b>traffic</b> than the old bridge could take. It was built by Murray & Roberts on behalf of New Limpopo Bridge Ltd who now operate the bridge.|$|R
50|$|For the {{majority}} of its length, State Route 111 is a two lane road. However it has recently been widened to four lanes for a short distance between The Shops at Biddeford Crossing and US-1 due to <b>heavier</b> <b>traffic</b> from nearby shopping centers.|$|R

5|$|The 1992 Civic District Master Plan public {{exhibition}} was held from 22–26 February by the URA. An important revision was the mentioning of the one-way Fort Canning Tunnel, entering the hill at the existing National Library and emerging at Penang Road {{to be built}} by the year 2000. The URA explained that the 380m long tunnel would help smoothen the major traffic intersection in front of Cathay Building and direct <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic</b> away from the Marina to Orchard areas, thus giving the museum precinct a peaceful and quiet ambience.|$|E
5|$|The Northern Parkway is a controlled-access parkway in Glendale, near Luke AFB. Beginning at an {{interchange}} with Loop 303, {{it follows}} the Butler Drive alignment (half a mile south of Olive Avenue) for about 4 miles until turning southeast to align with Northern Avenue right before its current terminus at Dysart Road. It {{is intended to}} relieve <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic</b> on Northern Avenue, some being contributed by the nearby military base.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{score was}} {{composed}} by Ed Bogas and Ray Shanklin. The soundtrack {{was released by}} Fantasy Records and Ampex Tapes in 1973. The album was released on compact disc in 1996 {{as part of a}} compilation that featured both the soundtracks to Fritz the Cat and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Traffic</b> on the same disc. The film also featured songs by Sérgio Mendes and Brasil '66, The Isley Brothers, Dave Brubeck, and Chuck Berry.|$|E

5|$|The Central Committee ordered Lazar Kaganovich {{to solve}} the railway crisis in 1935. Kaganovich first prioritised {{bottleneck}} areas over other less-traveled areas; his second priority was investing in <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic</b> lines, and thirdly, the least efficient areas of the rail network were left to themselves. Another problem facing rail transport was the massive industrialisation efforts pushed on by the authorities. The industrialisation {{proved to be a}} heavy burden on the railways, and Vyacheslav Molotov and Kaganovich even admitted this to the 18th party congress. Even so, the Soviet Government continued their industrialisation efforts to better prepare themselves for a future war with Germany, which became reality in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the early}} 2000s and despite <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic,</b> Illinois 22 {{generally}} remained a two lane road. The only sections that were four lanes were the intersections of Illinois 83, Buffalo Grove Road, Milwaukee Avenue, Interstate 94, Illinois 43, and U.S. 41. The lengthy two lane gaps in between those intersections, {{as well as}} the rest of Illinois 22 were heavily discussed for expansion starting in the early 1990s. These discussions included plans that called for additional lanes on its entire length from U.S. 14 to U.S. 41, including widening a section from U.S. 12 to Milwaukee Avenue to six lanes. Also mentioned was a bypass around the narrow, downtown area of Lake Zurich.|$|E
5|$|While Kate {{was moving}} through the Bahamas, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a {{hurricane}} warning from Jupiter to Fort Myers, Florida, including the Florida Keys. Then-Governor of Florida Bob Graham {{declared a state of}} emergency for six counties in South Florida. However, it was reversed following the relatively minor effects in the area. Officials recommended evacuation of the Florida Keys, leading to <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic</b> on the Overseas Highway and prompting the Red Cross to open 12shelters. Three shelters were opened in Key West, but only 500 individuals utilized them during the storm. Most residents chose to endure the storm in their homes. In Fort Lauderdale, schools were closed and residents of mobile homes were required to leave.|$|E
50|$|Work {{commenced}} in October 2009 {{to widen}} the 2 lane sections to 4 lanes as originally planned. The area near the south bound lanes leading into the Glenloch interchange was the first area to be widened as this area bears the <b>heaviest</b> <b>traffic</b> load during peak times.|$|R
