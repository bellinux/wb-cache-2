40|$|The European External Action Service (EEAS or Service) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} and most debated innovations introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. This analysis intends to explain the anomalous design of the EEAS in light of its function, which consists in the promotion of external action coherence. Coherence is a principle of the EU legal system, which requires synergy in the external actions of the Union and its Members. It can be enforced only through the coordination of European policy-makers' initiatives, by bridging the gap between the 'Communitarian' and <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>approaches.</b> This is the 'Union method' envisaged by A. Merkel: "coordinated action in a spirit of solidarity - each of us in the area for which we are responsible but all working towards the same goal". The EEAS embodies the 'Union method', since it is institutionally linked to both Union organs and Member States. It is also capable of enhancing synergy in policy management and promoting unity in international representation, since its field of action is delimited not by an abstract concern for institutional balance but by a pragmatic assessment of the need for coordination in each sector. The challenge is now to make sure that this pragmatic approach is applied with respect to all the activities of the Service, in order to reinforce its effectiveness. The coordination brought by the EEAS is in fact the only means through which a European foreign policy can come into being: the choice is not between the Community method and the intergovernmental method, but between a coordinated position and nothing at all. ...|$|R

The conclusions show that the IR approach has an explanatory capacity, and clarify the obstacles that the EU regions have to face in their strategy for a structural and legal recognition of their role within the EU.

50|$|Following May 1948 Congress of the Hague, {{was created}} in Italy, in December 1948, a National Council of the European Movement which was an {{organism}} {{in charge of the}} cooperation between the pro-European MPs and the European Federalist Movement. However its rebuilding was necessary in 1956 because of the opposition inside the pro-European movement between the so-called “functionalists”, supporters of a progressive market integration of the “little Europe” - in which they recognized the necessary base for every further development - and the majority of the Italian federalists, like Altiero Spinelli, very critical about the European governments after the failure of the European Community of Defence. In these conditions, it seemed unavoidable that the CIME assumes de facto an alternative character respecting to the militant federalism because of its composition (including political parties in charge and unions related to these). This situation evolved with time, notably thank to the accession of Giuseppe Petrilli at the Presidency in autumn 1964. In spite of being {{a former member of the}} EEC-three-first-year Commission, he matured a vision of the integration process which surpass the <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>approach.</b> The merger between the CIME and the Federalist Movement came to a conclusion in 1966 with the adhesion of the second to the first. The European Movement joined - first at the national level then to the European one - the fundamental positions of the federalist strategy and so recognized the importance of European Parliament election at the universal direct suffrage as an indispensable condition for any further progress on the political and institutional camp. When the parliamentary initiative of Altiero Spinelli (after the 1979 first EP elections) demonstrated the adequacy of this strategy, the CIME gave it its full support, through the strong pressure in favour of the treaty project made by the European Parliament to the Italian presidency of the Community, in the first semester of 1985. From there, the successive presidencies of Mauro Ferri, Mario Zagari e Giorgio Napolitano largely confirmed the continuity of the rapport within the CIME between the national political, social-economic forces and the federalist avant-garde. So the CIME counted among the protagonists in Italy of the constant commitment in favour of the Euro creation but also of European institutional reforms to get to the adoption of a real Constitution for the Union.|$|E

The findings of the analysis show that majority of states (11 of 13) prefer lower degree of harmonization whereas only 2 states along with EESC support more comprehensive harmonization. Also, 10 out of 13 states have "restrictive" or "rather restrictive" preferences towards further liberalization of immigration policy whereas the other three countries and EESC are considered to be "liberal" and "rather liberal".

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explain recent {{developments}} in the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) infrastructure policy and their implications for European integration theory. It sets out to test the view that firstly, the ad hoc nature of the TEN-T programme leads to national governments reaffirming their role as key actors within the EU policymaking process. Secondly, the aspiration of the EU's sustainable mobility strategy is not implemented in practice at the national level. The thesis combines theories of European integration with {{a study of the}} EU day-to-day transport policy making process to show how the TEN-T programme fits into wider debates on sustainability and European integration generally. To achieve this objective the thesis examines the dichotomous debate that exists between intergovernmental and supranational theorists in their attempts to conceptualise the wider process of European integration. It argues that such approaches drawn from International Relations (IR) are sufficient tools to explain the EU system of governance. In order to characterise the EU transport policy-making process more effectively this thesis highlights the need to adopt a combination of tools from both IR and Comparative Politics (CP) schools of thought. The transport sector is examined within the thesis for the reason that it remains one of the few policy areas that can better illustrate the tension between <b>intergovernmental</b> and supranational <b>approaches</b> to European integration. In addition, the transport sector is of European significance as decades of unrestrained growth have heightened concerns about its ability to achieve sustainable mobility. Indeed, the TEN-T programme is offered as part of the solution to Europe's transport problems and as a means of promoting sustainable mobility within the EU. However, analysis of the TEN-T policy development reveals a set of obstacles to the implentation of a sustainable European transport infrastructure policy. The findings resulting from this research are firstly, contrary to the assumption that European transport policy is dominated by an integrationist strategy of the political centre in Europe: it is the national government that remains the key actor in the European transport infrastructure policy process. Secondly, based on the evidence presented within this thesis, the transport sector does not signify a marked shift towards multi-level governance. Thirdly, the absence of this power sharing framework can be used to explain the unsustainable direction of the current TEN-T policy...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing economy}} and {{population}} in Lincoln, Nebraska have generated an expanding tax {{base for the}} city. Growth has been especially rapid in the property tax base. As noted {{in a recent report}} by the UNL Bureau of Business Research (2005), the average new housing unit generates annual property taxes for the City of Lincoln substantially greater than does the average existing housing unit. This additional property value is referred to as the “growth dividend” in the Bureau of Business Research report. This growth dividend is available for a variety of uses, including capital outlays on infrastructure, tax relief, or increases in non-capital expenditures by the City of Lincoln. This report examined how the city’s growth dividend has been allocated. The main findings of the report are as follows: •	Government expenditures rose at roughly the same rate as personal income in Lincoln during the 1990 to 2005 period. In other words, city government is approximately the same share of the Lincoln economy in 2005 as it was in 1990. •	There was a significant decline in the City of Lincoln’s property tax levy during the period. The city’s wheel tax, however, increased in the mid- 1990 s. •	At the same time that expenditures rose and property tax rates fell, the city also was able to rapidly increase capital outlay on infrastructure beginning in 1999. Much of the increase in capital outlay was for road infrastructure. Capital investment in roads occurred in both new neighborhoods and in existing areas such as downtown neighborhoods surrounding the Antelope Valley Project. •	Lincoln’s property and sales tax base, including the growth dividend, contributed to capital outlay for parks, fire, library, storm sewer infrastructure, and street lights, but did not contribute to other types of infrastructure for streets and highways. •	The increase in capital outlay for streets and highways was largely fueled by rapid increases in intergovernmental transfers to the city, although local funding sources also expanded during the 1990 to 2005 period. The city raised the wheel tax, instituted impact fees, and increased property taxes for the county-wide Railroad Transportation Safety District (RTSD). Part of the increase in wheel tax, however, was devoted to fund snow removal, rather than street infrastructure. •	Options to maintain capital spending at the current level could include efforts to maintain recent large increases in <b>intergovernmental</b> transfers. Another <b>approach</b> would be for the City of Lincoln to allocate a larger portion of the growth dividend toward funding street and highway infrastructure while continuing to also use a portion for tax relief or non-capital expenditures...|$|R

The euro crisis has thus represented a test for testing the validity of the intergovernmental constitution of the Lisbon Treaty. Although the measures adopted in the period 2010 - 2012, consisting both of legislative decisions and new intergovernmental treaties, are of an unprecedented magnitude, they were nevertheless unable to promote effective and legitimate solutions for dealing with the financial crisis. In the context of an existential challenge, the <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>approach</b> faced a structural difficulty in solving basic dilemmas of collective action. The euro crisis {{has brought to}} the crisis of the intergovernmental EU not of the EU as such.

40|$|Central and Eastern European {{countries}} (CEEC) {{were expected}} to benefit substantially from European Union (EU) membership. As full members, they would take advantage of formal decision-making powers. Furthermore, EU instruments and norms would influence distributional issues and the common market would facilitate economic convergence. However, these positive expectations, which are underpinned by rational institutional and normative theories of enlargement, have become challenged by {{the effects of the}} 2004 and 2007 enlargement rounds. Therefore, drawing on the liberal <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>approach</b> (LIG), the article proposes to test an alternative explanation. First, it is proposed that EU decision-making powers are constrained by other powers possessed by the national governments. Second, the distributional issues are determined by individual interests and relative power (dependence). Third, economic convergence depends on the ability of individual governments to influence economic processes. The meta-study of post-accession Council decision-making, as well as case studies of some of the central distributional issues from the pre- and post-accession periods, and macroeconomic trends support the proposed LIG-based explanation...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} key {{challenges faced}} throughout the Asia and the Pacific {{region as a}} number of its developing economies graduate from low-income status to middle-income status {{at the same time as}} the region remains home to the majority of the world's poor people and a number of fragile states. The region is gaining increased influence in the world economy but is still grappling to overcome interrelated challenges of poverty and sustainable development, so its priorities will be of significant importance in informing the contents of any post- 2015 global development framework. Drawing from the ongoing lessons of the Millennium Development Goal process, this paper suggests a conceptual framework for setting a new generation of goals and, informed by these concepts, proposes an <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>approach</b> to implementation. The "ZEN" framework stresses the distinct challenges of achieving zero extreme poverty (Z), setting country-specific "Epsilon" benchmarks for broader development challenges (E), and promoting environmental sustainability both within and across borders (N) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{crisis in}} the eurozone– which became worse in Europe {{at the same time}} that the Lisbon Treaty entered in force at the end of 2009 – has {{presented}} the first test of the crisis management capabilities of the <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>approach.</b> As provided under the Lisbon Treaty, the European Council has been the true decision-making centre for the policies adopted in response to the financial crisis, with the Commission playing a technical role. This commentary finds, however, that this institutional set-up has been unsatisfactory and unable to overcome the three fundamental dilemmas of the integration process: the dilemma of veto power, the dilemma of enforcement of the agreements and the dilemma of decision-making legitimacy. While it remains to be seen whether the election of François Hollande as President of France signals the beginning of a new political cycle characterised by new ideas on the institutional future of the EU, if that were to materialise, this paper aims to contribute to the debate on those new ideas...|$|E
40|$|This work compares France and Italy's {{policies}} on European monetary integration {{from the early}} 1970 s arguing that the very different state structures determined the different policies pursued towards European monetary integration. France is a 'strong' state in terms of macroeconomic policy-making {{in that it was}} able to coordinate the activities of national institutions in order to produce coherent macroeconomic policies that were a crucial condition for taking part in European monetary integration. Italy, in contrast, is characterised by an 'archipelago' configuration with weak political capacity, which resulted in less coherent and effective macroeconomic policies, thus challenging its participation in European monetary agreements. State traditions also affected the views of the respective countries on European integration with French policy makers largely in favour of an <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>approach</b> and Italian policy makers supporting a supranational one. Overall, whereas it was politically problematic for France to accept the principles of a supranational Economic and Monetary Union as well as central bank independence, the main obstacle for Italy was to achieve economic convergence.
