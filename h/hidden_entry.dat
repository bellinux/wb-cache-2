There, Wong sent Alan and three other men to kill the pair. Alan and Tequila then {{eliminated}} the two of the men. While the two bickered with each other, the third man, Mad Dog, killed Foxy. They then discovered a <b>hidden</b> <b>entry</b> to the hospital morgue where they found Wong's arsenal of guns. Mad Dog attacked them, but then escaped by locking the pair in Wong's armory. Johnny Wong saw that his arsenal was compromised proceeded to take the entire hospital hostage. Amongst the hostages were Superintendent Pang and Officer Teresa Chang (Tequila's girlfriend) who were called to the scene. Alan and Tequila eventually fought their way through the hospital and freed the hostages before going after Wong. The pair split up; Tequila began evacuating babies from the maternity ward as Wong had planted explosives all over the building, and Alan faced off against Mad Dog. When the bombs were detonating, Tequila escaped with the babies and Alan and Wong went missing in the confusion. Wong later emerged with Alan as hostage. He made Tequila humiliate himself by slapping his own face and admitting his incompetence in exchange for Tony's life. In an awkward struggle with Wong, Alan shot himself in the stomach before Tequila grabbed the gun and shot Wong in the eye. Alan survived, however, and began a new life after Pang burned his file.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} joining process of newcomers in offline and online leisure pursuit groups. The notion of joining {{and becoming a}} member is a complex and under-explored area. People devote {{a significant amount of}} time and money to leisure and in modern life it is highly valued and desired. Yet it is acknowledged that leisure, as a distinctive aspect of society and social life, is often overlooked by researchers. More specifically, joining leisure groups can satisfy people’s need to belong and offer the conditions to pursuit their interests through social interaction, but understanding of this process is relatively under-developed. The research adopted a qualitative, predominantly inductive approach. For the first stage, an auto-ethnographic study was conducted on two offline and two online groups based in Yorkshire. For the final stage 18 face to face interviews were conducted with members of the same photographic groups. The interview data were analysed using thematic analysis. The first stage revealed that groups and newcomers themselves use different, formal and informal approaches to becoming members. Members were found to have varied capital and skills. Information disseminated by groups about themselves was often inaccurate in regards to the entry requirements. The findings indicated that photographers tend to follow an equipment upgrade path that is linked with the joining process. Competitions in different forms were found to be a common and an integral part of photographic groups. They were viewed as a way to gain prestige and credibility. Casual competitions enabled novices to participate and feel part of the group. Compared to offline groups, joining online was found to be initially easy but it was harder to achieve a strong sense of belonging in the group. Overall Communities of Practice theory was found to provide a useful perspective for exploring joining. The final stage discovered that joining is linked to learning. Becoming a full participant in photographic communities implies the ability to become involved in core activities and to gain competency. Furthermore joining was found to be linked to the shaping of the identity. Learning and the ambition to learn shapes the identity. Through imagination, photographic members create images of the world and see connections through time which enable to accept or reject future identities. They can pursue future identities by learning. Differing forms of capital are converted in the different types of groups (offline, online, hybrid). Key moments of identification mark the transition between the joining and the establishment phase in the Photographic Membership Career Model. Members in online groups commonly have narrow identification, a form of identification where members have or feel limited accountability towards the practice. Regarding the practical implications of the study, members should understand that they have to continuously adapt to or change the group domain in order to maintain their identification with the group. Newcomers need to be given a realistic idea of the <b>hidden</b> <b>entry</b> requirements and can select to join a type of group (offline, online, hybrid) that is more suitable to their set of capital. Newcomer-oriented groups should place more emphasis on orientation and be more tolerant, whereas more established groups can allocate fewer resources on orientation. ...|$|E
5000|$|Without any {{restrictions}} {{on the number of}} degrees of freedom in the completed matrix this problem is underdetermined since the <b>hidden</b> <b>entries</b> could be assigned arbitrary values. Thus matrix completion often seeks to find the lowest rank matrix or, if the rank of the completed matrix is known, a matrix of rank [...] that matches the known entries. The illustration shows that a partially revealed rank-1 matrix (on the left) can be completed with zero-error (on the right) since all the rows with missing entries should be the same as the third row. In the case of the Netflix problem the ratings matrix is expected to be low-rank since user preferences can often be described by a few factors, such as the movie genre and time of release. Other applications include computer vision, where missing pixels in images need to be reconstructed, detecting the global positioning of sensors in a network from partial distance information, and multiclass learning. The matrix completion problem is in general NP-hard, but there are tractable algorithms that achieve exact reconstruction with high probability.|$|R

40|$|Some {{rootkits}} that hide resources through user-mode API interception {{support the}} notion of “root processes ” [H 03] (or “privileged processes ” [N 04]), which are exempt from being hooked for API interception and so can see all <b>hidden</b> <b>entries.</b> In this paper, we use Hacker Defender (1. 00 and older) as an example and describe a simple technique to “root ” such a rootkit (i. e., to run our program as a root process of the rootkit) using the Strider GhostBuster quick scanner to identify infected machines in the enterprise.

By enumerating the processes through the regular Process 32 First/Process 32 Next APIs (or any of your favorite high-level APIs) and enumerating them again using a lower-level call described in the Appendix, and taking a diff, we can detect any user-mode hidden process within a fraction of a second. Not all hidden processes are root processes. One way to identify a root process is to inject the diff’ing code described above into every hidden process; the ones that do not report a diff are root processes. In practice, the number of hidden processes is small. So one can manually try Step # 2 on every hidden process; whichever that gives us what we want is a root process.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an economic {{explanation of the}} democratic revolutions that swept across Northern Africa and the Middle East in early 2011. We model political transitions as equilibrium outcomes of a repeated game, between a ruling class of elite and a working class.

The elite ruling class choose between an efficient, publicly observable method of predation (income tax) and an inefficient, <b>hidden</b> method (<b>entry</b> costs on entrepreneurs) that is not observed by the working class. The inefficient method leads to bad labor market outcomes that could have arisen independent of the elite’s institutional choice, which {{is the source of}} an informational asymmetry. In this context, we characterize the conditions under which (i) autocrats will chose inefficient economic institutions, (ii) information shocks can catalyze revolutions, (iii) revolutions can be contagious due to similar informational transmissions, and (iv) democracy can be consolidated following revolution...|$|R

40|$|Privacy {{preserving}} {{data processing}} {{has become an}} important topic recently because of advances in hardware technology which have lead to widespread proliferation of demographic and sensitive data. A rudimentary way to preserve privacy is to simply hide the information {{in some of the}} sensitive fields picked by a user. However, such a method is far from satisfactory in its ability to prevent adversarial data mining. Real data records are not randomly distributed. As a result, some fields in the records may be correlated with one another. If the correlation is sufficiently high, it may be possible for an adversary to predict some of the sensitive fields using other fields. In this paper, we study the problem of privacy preservation against adversarial data mining, which is to hide a minimal set of entries so that the privacy of the sensitive fields are satisfactorily preserved. In other words, even by data mining, an adversary still cannot accurately recover the <b>hidden</b> data <b>entries.</b> We model the problem concisely and develop an efficient heuristic algorithm which can find good solutions in practice. An extensive performance study is conducted on both synthetic and real data sets to examine the effectiveness of our approach.

40|$|Nine {{out of ten}} acts of {{sabotage}} {{are committed}} by people {{one way or another}} associated with information technologies. According to experts at InfoWatch, developer of systems to protect confidential information from insiders, the reason for this profession lies in the psychological characteristics of these employees. Reading more will allow understanding the problem with a couple of examples from the life that most powerfully illustrate typical traits of professionals in the information environment. And, although the first teller did not hide his name, the second one decided to remain anonymous. Deep psychological background of the act of sabotage often leads to the fact that a disgruntled employee threatens boss or colleagues, for example, by e-mail. Sometimes he even shares his thoughts with someone from colleagues. In other words, not only the attacker knows the information about the upcoming sabotage. Analysts estimate that other people know 31 % of information about the plans of a saboteur. Of these, 64 % are colleagues, 21 % with friends 14 % — family members and another 14 % were accomplices. It was also determined that 62 % of corporate saboteurs think through their actions beforehand.

40|$|Hidden mineshafts {{located in}} urban areas are a {{significant}} problem {{across much of the}} industrialized world. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is a technique that can detect and characterize <b>hidden</b> mine <b>entries</b> by exploiting resistivity contrasts between the shaft and surrounding materials, resulting from either compositional or structural differences. A case study is presented in which both surface and crosshole 3 D ERT surveys are used to image a hidden backfilled mineshaft at a built environment site, situated on Carboniferous Lower Coal Measures strata in the UK. Backfilled shafts generally present the greatest challenge for detection using geophysical methods, as contrasts between the fill and bedrock are typically low compared to air or water-filled conditions. Nevertheless, the shaft in this case was identified by both the surface and crosshole 3 D surveys. The shaft appeared as a strongly resistive anomaly relative to background materials, which we interpreted as resulting from the disturbed fabric of the fill materials rather than any significant compositional differences. The study highlighted the respective strengths and weaknesses of the surface and crosshole ERT methodologies for this type of problem. The surface survey, which covered a non-rectangular area to accommodate irregular boundaries and other physical obstructions, provided a relatively rapid means of investigating the study site. However, this method had a limited depth of investigation and was constrained in its coverage by the locations of buildings. By contrast, the 3 D crosshole method was able to image the shaft {{to the level of the}} deepest borehole electrodes. Although crosshole ERT is too expensive to be used for large-scale mineshaft surveys, this study clearly demonstrates its suitability for targeted investigations where surface methods cannot be deployed, such as scanning beneath surface structures or in situations where it is essential for resolution to be maintained with depth.

40|$|Harborage of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella {{on animal}} hides at {{slaughter}} {{is the main}} source of beef carcass contamination during processing. Given this finding, interventions have been designed and implemented to target the hides of cattle following entry into beef processing plants. Previous interventions targeting hides have not been suitable for all beef processing plants because of cost and space restrictions. In this study, a hide wash cabinet was evaluated to determine whether it was more amenable to widespread use in the beef processing industry, especially for small and medium-size plants. Overall, 101 (35. 1 %) of 288 beef cattle <b>hides</b> sampled before <b>entry</b> into the <b>hide</b> wash cabinet harbored E. coli O 157 :H 7 at or above the limit of detection (40 CFU/ 100 cm 2). After passage through the hide wash cabinet, only 38 (13. 2 %) of 288 hides had E. coli O 157 :H 7 levels 40 CFU/ 100 cm 2. Before the hide wash cabinet, 50 (17 %) of 288 hides harbored E. coli O 157 :H 7 at levels above 100 CFU/ 100 cm 2, with one sample as high as 20, 000 CFU/ 100 cm 2. In contrast, only 14 (5 %) of 288 hides had E. coli O 157 :H 7 levels above 100 CFU/ 100 cm 2 after hide washing, with the highest being 2, 000 CFU/ 100 cm 2. These same trends also were found for Salmonella before and after hide washing. These results indicate that the hide wash cabinet described in this study was effective and should provide small and medium-size processing plants with an affordable hide wash intervention strategy.

5000|$|The mansion {{is spread}} out over three floors {{featuring}} a total of 55 rooms, including 10 bedrooms, 12 bathrooms, 7 fireplaces, and 3 kitchens illuminated by 861 light bulbs. The layout {{of the house is}} generally a central hall plan, {{and as a result of}} being built on the side of a hill, the entrance hall is located on the second floor. Defining the space is a large stone arch flanked by two lower rectangular openings, through which a short flight of stairs lead to a landing behind the arch featuring a balustrade. Overhead are gilded domed ceilings, and the space is embellished with two stone carved night owls, peering out of the stairway niches through glowing red eyes. Below the arch, a grand stairway leads down to the first level, and to the Hall of Merriment. The hall is named due to the four whimsical carvings of men representing [...] "Eat, drink and be merry," [...] with the fourth figure taking a pinch of snuff. The hall today is the site of the Carl and Carolyn Renfro Gallery that feature replicas of the twelve statues entered in a competition to depict the Pioneer Woman. To the left of the hall is the service area of the house including the main kitchen where a majority of the cooking was done, the staff dining room and pantry. On the right was originally a handball court for the amusement of family and friends, but has been re-purposed as the administrative offices for the Estate and the National Petroleum Hall of Fame. At the far eastern side of the house are two lounges, the inner lounge known as the Winter Room, and the outer lounge known as the Summer Room. The Winter Room has a large fireplace with a hearth that <b>hides</b> a small <b>entry</b> to a panic room that could have been used by the family during any dangerous situations. Above the concrete beams of the ceiling are decorated with artwork tracing the history of Oklahoma from the days of the pre-Columbian Native Americans through the discovery of oil by Marland Oil Company. The third kitchen is also located in this room and is known as the Hunt Kitchen as this is where guest assembled for breakfast before the fox hunts. Adjacent to the Hunt Kitchen is the secret Poker Room that concealed a hidden Whiskey Room and door to the 550 foot tunnel leading to the Boat House and Artist Studio. The ceilings in the Summer Lounge were designed and painted by Vincent Maragliotti free of charge and pay homage to the spirit of the 1920s.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. This study {{examines}} {{the value and}} relevance of autobiographical texts in the classroom. For {{the purpose of this}} study the focus is on Het Achterhuis: dagboekbrieven van Anne Frank. It is a critical study to establish whether autobiographical texts such as Het Achterhuis should have a rightful place in the learning environment alongside novels and other texts in the Afrikaans classroom and to determine how learners can benefit when they are exposed to a variety of texts to develop their minds through analytical thinking and creative writing. Chapter one presents a theoretical perspective on autobiographical texts such as the autobiography, the letter, memoires and the diary. Through autobiographical texts readers gain knowledge about peoples’ lives, experiences, weaknesses and strengths. Human interest arouses curiosity and encourages reading and research. Chapter two offers a literary analysis of Het Achterhuis. The textual analysis focuses on the background of Anne Frank during her period of hiding from persecution in the holocaust as well as on the interpersonal relationships and difficult circumstances the eight people in hiding had to share. With the coming to power of Hitler in 1933 and the subsequent persecution of the Jews, their rights were restricted step by step and the Jewish community was gradually isolated. Deportation started and thousands of Jews went into hiding. In July 1942 Otto Frank, his wife and two daughters together with four other Jews moved into a secret annexe behind Otto Frank’s business premises. The experiences of the above-mentioned eight people in hiding have been described by Anne Frank in a diary which she selected when her and her father Otto went shopping together. She received the diary which was one of her most precious gifts on her thirteenth birthday, shortly before going into <b>hiding.</b> The diary <b>entries</b> of Anne Frank convey a key message of tolerance and perseverance. Chapter three of this study focuses on the physical, emotional and social development of the adolescent. Anne Frank’s diary was written when she was in the age group 13 – 15. High school learners can identify with Anne Frank as a teenager like themselves who also experienced the typical insecurities, resentments and rebelliousness of the adolescent. In addition to the historical value of Anne Frank’s diary as a testimony of the holocaust, she is a role model for the teenager of today. The example of how Anne dealt with her problems helps learners to overcome obstacles and to deal with the realities in life. Finally, chapter four investigates the numerous possibilities of using Het Achterhuis as a text in the classroom to enhance teaching and learning. This chapter is based on actual findings that were made after using Het Achterhuis as a prescribed text in a grade 11 classroom in 2006. An important finding is that learners can benefit by being exposed to a variety of texts about life writing to develop their minds by analytical and critical thinking, creative writing and integration with other school subjects. Through autobiographical texts diverse perspectives can be introduced to enable learners to develop a more balanced view of the world. The code of the diary offers the best opportunity to give expression to one’s own life. Narratives are necessary to form your own identity. Through diary inscriptions you make contact with the inner self and a sense of identity is achieved...|$|R
