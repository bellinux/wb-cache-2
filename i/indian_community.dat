5|$|The Abdullah {{case that}} had brought him to South Africa {{concluded}} in May 1894, and the <b>Indian</b> <b>community</b> organised a farewell party for Gandhi {{as he prepared to}} return to India. However, a new Natal government discriminatory proposal led to Gandhi extending his original period of stay in South Africa. He planned to assist Indians in opposing a bill to deny them the right to vote, a right then proposed to be an exclusive European right. He asked Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary, to reconsider his position on this bill. Though unable to halt the bill's passage, his campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. He helped found the Natal Indian Congress in 1894, and through this organisation, he moulded the <b>Indian</b> <b>community</b> of South Africa into a unified political force. In January 1897, when Gandhi landed in Durban, a mob of white settlers attacked him and he escaped only through the efforts of the wife of the police superintendent. However, he refused to press charges against any member of the mob.|$|E
5|$|The route {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with SR 84 west of Stanfield. SR 347 then heads northward as John Wayne Parkway, a four-lane expressway, which SR 347 is for its entirety, through a desert landscape. After intersecting Meadowview Road and crossing a canal, SR 347 meets Carefree Place, where a farm appears {{to the west}} part of the road. At Clayton Road, {{the east side of}} the road becomes farmland as well. John Wayne Parkway enters the Ak-Chin <b>Indian</b> <b>Community,</b> passing the Harrah's Ak-Chin Casino, and intersects BIA Route 14 within this community. At Route 14, the route becomes Maricopa Road, but retains its name as John Wayne Parkway, as it heads toward Maricopa. Continuing on its northerly path, the road exits the <b>Indian</b> <b>community</b> with a residential area to the west and desert to the east. Past Bowlin road, this orientation switches, as the residential area is located on the east side of Maricopa Road. The arrangement of the landscape switches again at Desert Cedars Road, where the road passes the Maricopa First Baptist Church. Before meeting the Maricopa-Casa Grande Highway, the road passes Maricopa High School. It also meets an at-grade intersection with a rail line, owned by Union Pacific.|$|E
5|$|North of this highway, SR 347 passes Honeycutt Road {{and passes}} by the Pinal County Justice Court. After an {{intersection}} with Edison Road, SR 347 passes several businesses before intersecting SR 238, named Smith Enke Road. The route then enters another residential area before abruptly passing into the desert. The road turns more northeasterly, heading through the Gila River <b>Indian</b> <b>Community.</b> Turning back north and slightly northeast again, the road crosses from Pinal County into Maricopa County. After intersecting Riggs Road, Maricopa Road veers away from John Wayne Parkway, which SR 347 follows. Now as Queen Creek Road, {{which serves as}} another name, SR 347 heads east for a small distance, ending at a diamond interchange at I-10's exit 164. Queen Creek Road continues toward Chandler Municipal Airport.|$|E

5|$|All the {{candidates}} in a GRC must either {{be members of}} the same political party or independent candidates standing as a group, and at least one of {{the candidates}} must be a person belonging to the Malay, Indian or some other minority community. A person is regarded as belonging to the Malay community if, regardless of whether or not he or she is of the Malay race, considers himself or herself to be a member of the community and is generally accepted as such by the community. Similarly, a person will belong to the <b>Indian</b> <b>community</b> or some other minority community if he or she considers himself or herself a member and the community accepts him or her as such. The minority status of candidates is determined by two committees appointed by the President, the Malay Community Committee and the Indian and Other Minority Communities Committee. Decisions of these committees are final and conclusive, and may not be appealed against or called into question in any court.|$|E
5|$|In Menominee County, the {{environment}} {{takes on a}} more agricultural character along US2. The highway passes through {{the edge of the}} community of Hermansville before entering Powers. US2 comes to a three-way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US41. The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and Spaulding {{on the south side of}} the CN Railway. At Harris, the trunkline enters the Hannahville <b>Indian</b> <b>Community.</b> Harris is on the Menominee County side of the reservation, but as the highway continues east, it crosses over to Bark River on the Delta County side. The county line in between not only separates the two communities, but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones. East of Bark River, the highway crosses the community's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M‑69. The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of Escanaba.|$|E

5|$|To attract {{support from}} Kenya's <b>Indian</b> <b>community,</b> he {{made contact with}} Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the newly {{independent}} Indian republic. Nehru's response was supportive, {{sending a message to}} Kenya's Indian minority reminding them that they were the guests of the indigenous African population. Relations with the white minority nevertheless remained strained; for most white Kenyans, Kenyatta was their principal enemy, an agitator with links to the Soviet Union and who had the impertinence to marry a white woman. They too increasingly called for further Kenyan autonomy from the British government, but wanted continued white-minority rule and closer links to the white-minority governments of South Africa, Northern Rhodesia, and Southern Rhodesia; they viewed the newly elected Labour Party government of Britain with great suspicion. The white Electors' Union had put forward a 'Kenya Plan' which proposed greater white settlement in Kenya, bringing Tanganyika into the British Empire, and incorporating it within their new British East African Dominion. In April 1950, Kenyatta was present at a joint meeting of KAU and the East African Indian National Congress in which they both expressed opposition to the Kenya Plan.|$|E
