500|$|Gregg Doyel, {{national}} {{columnist for}} CBSSports.com, proclaimed Robinson the front-runner for the Heisman Trophy: [...] "Denard Robinson {{has earned the}} right to pole position in the Heisman race. It's not close. And <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stays</b> healthy, I fully expect him to walk across a stage in New York City in December and take that trophy home." ...|$|E
500|$|The Secret of Monkey Island is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. Via a point-and-click interface, the player guides protagonist Guybrush Threepwood through the game's world and {{interacts with the}} environment by selecting from twelve verb commands (nine in newer versions) such as [...] "talk to" [...] for communicating with characters and [...] "pick up" [...] for collecting items between commands and the world's objects in order to successfully solve puzzles and thus progress in the game. While conversing with other characters, the player may choose between topics for discussion that are listed in a dialog tree; the game {{is one of the}} first to incorporate such a system. The in-game action is frequently interrupted by cutscenes. Like other LucasArts adventure games, The Secret of Monkey Island features a design philosophy that makes the player character's death nearly impossible (Guybrush does drown <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stays</b> underwater for more than ten minutes).|$|E
500|$|By this time, Cartman {{arrives with}} [...] "Mitch Conner", a face painted {{on his hand}} as {{one-half}} of a ventriloquist act. Previously, Connor had successfully impersonated actress Jennifer Lopez in [...] "Fat Butt and Pancake Head", and now Cartman and Connor return to the Lopez imitation {{in order to get}} involved in the lawsuit along with the other celebrities. Connor soon secretly convinces Cartman that they should steal Muhammad's goo for themselves to sell on the black market for more than the lawsuit could offer. Meanwhile, Kyle and Stan convince the Super Best Friends to let Muhammad come to town, but only <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stays</b> in the back of a U-Haul truck and is not seen. When the townspeople realize they must bring Muhammad to Cruise's limo, they allegedly put him inside a bear mascot outfit. South Park is about to give Muhammad to the celebrities when the exchange is interrupted by a bomb planted by the Ginger Kids, a group of fair-skinned, red-haired children who are tired of being made fun of for their physical appearance. [...] The Gingers want Muhammad for themselves, hoping to use his goo for their own means. They threaten to blow up the town if Muhammad is not turned over to them.|$|E
50|$|Molin then {{signed for}} Bajen Fans IF, a supporter-operated club that was formed {{following}} {{the bankruptcy of}} Hammarby <b>IF.</b> <b>He</b> <b>stayed</b> for two seasons before retiring in 2012.|$|R
6000|$|... [Sent to {{a friend}} who had complained that I was glad enough to see him when he came, but didn't seem to miss him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> away.] ...|$|R
5000|$|The New York Times {{states the}} book would've been better <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> with the {{character}} Hal as the narrator, and not mostly relied on others they called [...] "flakier" ...|$|R
2500|$|Also his cover {{drive and}} flick off the hip are {{right up there}} in terms of {{execution}} and attractiveness. ... He can score quickly at times but it is his way {{of being able to}} read situations that sets him apart. ... He knows when to grind it out or move up through the gears. Some people think he could move through the gears quicker when batting, and that is probably a fair argument on occasions, but the majority of the time he knows what he can do at the crease and believes South Africa {{have a better chance of}} winning <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stays</b> there.|$|E
2500|$|After being [...] "burnt" [...] in {{the middle}} of an {{operation}} in Southern Nigeria, and being beaten and kidnapped to follow, Westen finds himself in his hometown of Miami, Florida. He is tended to by his ex-girlfriend, Fiona Glenanne, but he has been abandoned by all his normal intelligence contacts and is under continuous surveillance with his personal assets frozen. Extraordinary efforts to reach his U.S. government handler eventually yield only a grudging admission that someone powerful wants him [...] "on ice" [...] in Miami. If he leaves there, he will be hunted down and taken into custody. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>stays,</b> he can remain relatively free. Consumed by the desire to find out who burned him and why, Westen is reluctantly drawn into working as an unlicensed private investigator and problem solver for ordinary citizens to fund his personal investigation into his situation as a blacklisted agent.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{a lot of}} rubbish {{a tenant}} gets about him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stays</b> long enough in one place, to be sure,' said Mr. Beeton, at last.|$|E
5000|$|According to Aisha, [...] "The Messenger of Allah did {{not ever}} send Zayd ibn Haritha in an army without {{putting him in}} command of it, even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> after <b>he</b> {{appointed}} him." ...|$|R
50|$|Van Roosmalen told a Wired news {{reporter}} {{that he has}} a video of two ex-policemen knocking on his door immediately after tucking revolvers into their pants. Believing that he would be killed <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stayed,</b> <b>he</b> and his wife are on the run with no plans to return to their home in Manaus as of May 2008.|$|R
6000|$|Eben had hastily slipped out. He {{was afraid}} Miriam would begin talking {{religion}} to him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stayed.</b> <b>He</b> had with difficulty escaped from an exhortation by Robert in the cow-stable. There was no peace in Avonlea for the unregenerate, he reflected. Robert and Miriam had both [...] "come out," [...] and Mollie was hovering on the brink.|$|R
6000|$|... "As soon as I get home, I shall send in my {{notice of}} {{resignation}} at Midsummer. That will see out her last boy, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stays</b> even so long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is well away, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stays</b> away: you and I need scarce {{any longer}} pray for {{eyes in the}} backs of our heads. But what make we next?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Respect! What respect have I for {{the murderer}} of my son? Respect! Well, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stays</b> here against my bidding, perhaps her ladyship will show him what respect means." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nothing {{had been}} discovered!--he was still safe! But <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> at the cavity till the mists faded before the moonlight, {{could he be}} certain of {{preserving}} his security? He felt that he could not! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well, it doesn't matter. As I won't have {{a minute}} until the sowing is finished, I'll be out when <b>he</b> comes. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> with his work just now, {{it would be better}} for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad I done it; for it {{will make}} a man of Lisha; and, if I've sent him to his death, God knows he'll be fitter to die than <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> here idlin' his life away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jimmy {{must start}} soon. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>stays,</b> the troopers will get him," [...] Jardine agreed, and {{indicated}} his cut foot. [...] "Somebody must warn the lad, but I canna gang." ...|$|E
6000|$|But you, my dear, may let him know, [...] In civil language, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stays,</b> How {{deep and}} foul the roads may grow, [...] And {{that he may}} command the chaise.|$|E
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>stays</b> here I {{shall have}} to see him constantly. I shan't {{have a chance to}} get over it. Oh, I can't. I can't. It's intolerable. Have pity on me.|$|E
60|$|Exactly. Ronny {{has had his}} {{experience}} here. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> longer {{it would only be}} waste of time. Anne naturally wants to have him near her. I daresay she's a little afraid of his getting into mischief here.|$|R
60|$|He understood. She {{only would}} {{denounce}} him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stayed.</b> She wished him no evil, only desired {{him out of}} her sight. He tried to say something flippant, something cruel and sneering, but she stopped him with a peremptory gesture.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] remarked Alan, [...] "that is {{very kind}} of you," [...] and feeling that <b>he</b> would faint <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> longer in this horrible and haunted vault, he pushed past her with little {{ceremony}} and walked out through the gates into the passage beyond.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you, Asika," [...] he said. [...] "Now, if {{your words}} are true, set Fahni free {{and let him}} return to his own country, for <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stays</b> here he will die." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is a {{very passionate}} man," [...] said the landlord, when he was alone with our friends. [...] "I do not care <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stays</b> away. He is poor pay and he wants too much for his money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must have}} some wine of Bordeaux. With that and the mottled cow's calf and the fowls and a goose, we can set forth a {{sufficient}} repast <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stays</b> only for the one night. How many will be with him?" ...|$|E
25|$|Odysseus {{was washed}} ashore on Ogygia, where the nymph Calypso lived. She made him her lover {{for seven years}} and would not let him leave, {{promising}} him immortality <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stayed.</b> On behalf of Athena, Zeus intervened and sent Hermes to tell Calypso to let Odysseus go.|$|R
50|$|Sigmund Freud {{offered him}} free {{analysis}} <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> in Vienna {{just as he}} was offered a position at the Johns Hopkins Institute. He chose to enter into analysis with Freud and was noted as a shining star amongst analysts of his generation, and a favourite pupil of Freud's.|$|R
60|$|But {{a sudden}} violent {{renewal of the}} {{metallic}} yelling announced the fact that somebody had won the race. Mary became once more the centre of a dangerous vortex. It was time, Denis thought, to move on; he might be asked to do something <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> too long.|$|R
60|$|ANTHONY. (Lighting a cheroot.) I {{firmly believe}} the funk will kill him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stays</b> down. You know {{the amount of}} trouble he's been giving Fewton {{for the last three}} weeks. He's doing his very best to frighten himself into the grave.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{our only}} chance. We can {{cut through the}} woods and come out near this {{friendly}} house on the Richelieu. The friar will lose our trail then, and we'll have no more trouble with him, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stays</b> on the St. Lawrence." ...|$|E
6000|$|The man {{of science}} shrugged his shoulders. [...] "All right! He can take {{his choice of}} roads"--he used an {{expressive}} gesture--"up or down. One leads to the New Jerusalem and is short--as he'll find out <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stays</b> here. Good-night! I must get that train." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus was George utterly routed. Not that Rebecca {{was in the}} right; but she {{had managed}} most {{successfully}} {{to put him in}} the wrong. And he now shamefully fled, feeling, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> another minute, that he would have been made to look foolish in the presence of Amelia.|$|R
60|$|While Somerset {{informed}} her {{on this and}} other matters, Mrs. Goodman entered and joined in the discussion, after which they found {{it would be necessary}} to adjourn to the room where the plans were hanging. On their walk thither Paula asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stayed</b> late at the ball.|$|R
60|$|While Nelly {{told her}} tale and the ladies {{questioned}} and comforted her, this bad monkey had skipped downstairs {{and had a}} delightful party all by himself. He was just scraping the jelly out of a tart when they disturbed him; and knowing that more slaps were in store for him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>stayed,</b> <b>he</b> at once walked calmly down the ravaged table, and vanished {{out of the window}} carrying the silver tea-strainer with him to play with.|$|R
