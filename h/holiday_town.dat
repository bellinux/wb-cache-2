The eclectic Victorian design has been criticised by John Newman in the 1965 Buildings of England series. He speaks of an [...] "inept design" [...] and of a [...] "classical vocabulary thus debased," [...] saying that the second stage of Corinthian columns should have been smaller than the first Doric stage of columns. He adds that the top is [...] "hurriedly finished off." [...] However this is not a formal state building. It is locally celebrated for what it is: an adornment of a <b>holiday</b> <b>town</b> where eccentric and humorous entertainment, and a gentle relaxation of workaday rules, have been the norm for nearly 200 years.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the start}} of tourism as {{rewarding}} and massive activity in the mid-nineteenth century, the traditional urban systems of the Spanish coast have been transformed to satisfy an increasingly changeable and demanding typology of tourist. Among the different models of urban development {{that have taken place}} so far, this study examines the phenomenon of New <b>Holiday</b> Towns: New <b>Towns</b> planned for mass tourism, with an own identity and certain degree of economic and/or political autonomy. These ex-novo settlements are built over tabula rasa and based on a large scale, master plan with an independent urban structure, thanks to strong business investment and the support and commitment from local government. The keys to success: leisure as a consumer product and an efficient marketing. The objective {{of this paper is to}} reflect on this model of tourist development that is spreading internationally. For this, firstly the economic, social and political reality that facilitates its emergence and subsequent development was studied. A few cases of New <b>Holiday</b> <b>Towns</b> were studied chronologically, noting the notable difference between the first appeared and the current ones. And finally, a sociological study was carried out in a specific case: Marina d'Or, in the municipality of Oropesa del Mar, Castell 3 n. I wanted to know the intensity of use that neighbors make of public space, ways of inhabiting urban space in daily life, what kind of user frequent these towns, why, for how long, what are their customs, satisfaction level, valuation of urban space 2 ̆ 026 To do this I used a quantitative methodology, the survey, and ethnography as a qualitative method of analysis through participant observation. This study questions this model of tourist development, arguing that its urban management and exclusive reliance on the tourist activity turn New <b>Holiday</b> <b>Towns</b> into Non-places. Is being a Non-place a symptom for the future stagnation of these New Towns? In that Case, what would be the panacea for them...|$|R
