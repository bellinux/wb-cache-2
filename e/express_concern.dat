5|$|Interviews with {{communities}} {{from both}} sides of the political divide indicate how Chávez is seen by the rich and poor. The latter support his stated aim to redistribute the country's oil wealth; the former fear totalitarianism and are worried Chávez will institute communism. In February 2002, the media war intensifies after Chavez takes control of PDVSA. The film states that the company was previously run as a private interest for the benefit of a minority, despite being state-owned. Business leader Pedro Carmona and union boss Carlos Ortega are the main voices of the opposition. After the pair visit Washington, D.C., the CIA and the State Department <b>express</b> <b>concern</b> about Chávez's rule and stress the importance of Venezuela's oil. A Venezuelan general appears on private television to voice similar disquiet. Carmona appeals for a public protest at the offices of PDVSA.|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 1946, Boeing's Model 462, a straight-wing {{aircraft}} {{powered by}} six Wright T35 turboprops with a gross weight of 360,000pounds (160,000kg) and a combat radius of 3,110miles (2,700nmi, 5,010km), was declared the winner. On 28 June 1946, Boeing was issued {{a letter of}} contract for US$1.7million to build a full-scale mock-up of the new XB-52 and do preliminary engineering and testing. However, by October 1946, the air force began to <b>express</b> <b>concern</b> about {{the sheer size of}} the new aircraft and its inability to meet the specified design requirements. In response, Boeing produced Model 464, a smaller four-engine version with a 230,000pound (105,000kg) gross weight, which was briefly deemed acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{by trained}} marksmen is {{considered}} to be the most practical method of control due to its effectiveness. The NSW Department of Primary Industries believe shooting is the preferred method of population control as it does not subject the horses to the stresses of mustering, yarding, and long-distance transportation, all of which are related to 'capture and removal' methods. Horses that are only initially wounded from shooting are tracked and dispatched if they are in accessible, open country. However, shooting of horses in mountain ranges is not regarded as a humane means of control. Helicopter shootings allow for aerial reconnaissance of a large area to target the densest populations, and shooters may get close enough to the target animals to ensure termination. This method is considered the most effective and cost efficient means of control, but disapproval is high amongst those that believe it is inhumane. Organizations supporting Brumbies argue that aerial shooting is unnecessary and that alternative population control methods have not been given adequate trials, while government officials <b>express</b> <b>concern</b> about the need to control rapidly growing populations in order to avoid ecological problems associated with too many feral horses in certain areas.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Opposition {{to human}} {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) vaccination is common {{on social media}} and {{has the potential to}} impact vaccine coverage. This study aims to conduct an international comparison of the proportions of tweets about HPV vaccines that <b>express</b> <b>concerns,</b> the types of <b>concerns</b> <b>expressed</b> and the social connections among users posting about HPV vaccines in Australia, Canada and the UK. DESIGN: Using a cross-sectional design, an international comparison of English language tweets about HPV vaccines and social connections among Twitter users posting about HPV vaccines between January 2014 and April 2016 was conducted. The Health Belief Model, {{one of the most widely}} used theories in health psychology, was used as the basis for coding the types of HPV vaccine <b>concerns</b> <b>expressed</b> on Twitter. SETTING: The content of tweets and the social connections between users who posted tweets about HPV vaccines from Australia, Canada and the UK. POPULATION: 16 789 Twitter users who posted 43 [*] 852 tweets about HPV vaccines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportions of tweets <b>expressing</b> <b>concern,</b> the type of <b>concern</b> <b>expressed</b> and the proportions of local and international social connections between users. RESULTS: Tweets <b>expressing</b> <b>concerns</b> about HPV vaccines made up 14. 9 % of tweets in Canada, 19. 4 % in Australia and 22. 6 % in the UK. The types of <b>concerns</b> <b>expressed</b> were similar across the three countries, with concerns related to 'perceived barriers' being the most common. Users <b>expressing</b> <b>concerns</b> about HPV vaccines in each of the three countries had a relatively high proportion of international followers also <b>expressing</b> <b>concerns.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The proportions and types of HPV vaccine <b>concerns</b> <b>expressed</b> on Twitter were similar across the three countries. Twitter users who mostly <b>expressed</b> <b>concerns</b> about HPV vaccines were better connected to international users who shared their concerns compared with users who did not <b>express</b> <b>concerns</b> about HPV vaccines.

5|$|In {{the years}} between 1993 till 1996, the Cambodian defence {{ministry}} attempted to integrate the different factions together, but were unsuccessful. In a dossier written by Nhek Bun Chhay around mid-1997, there were 80,800 pro-FUNCINPEC troops, which were divided into 11 battalions across the country. Nhek also <b>express</b> <b>concern</b> of the inferior troop strength of the pro-FUNCINPEC forces, as they were slightly outnumbered compared to 90,000 pro-CPP troops. In November 1996, armed skirmishes occurred between RCAF troops separately aligned to CPP and FUNCINPEC, after a pro-CPP general, Keo Pong accused a pro-FUNCINPEC general, Serey Kosal of attempting to kill him, who in turn accused Keo Pong of recruiting Khmer Rouge defectors into his ranks. More armed skirmishes broke out until February 1997, leaving 14 pro-CPP and 2 pro-FUNCINPEC troops wounded. Subsequently, Ke Kim Yan, the chief-of-staff of the RCAF stepped in to meditate the conflict, and a directive was issued to prohibit movement of troops without the explicit permission of the government. In late March 1997, the two co-defense ministers, Tea Banh of the CPP and Tea Chamrath of FUNCINPEC, together with Ke Kim Yan and Nhek Bun Chhay formed a bipartisan defence committee was formed to prevent the RCAF from getting embroiled into the political conflict between Ranariddh and Hun Sen.|$|E

Mary Magdalene is stated in the Gospels to be the first person to see Jesus after his resurrection. In the narratives, Jesus charged her to tell others of what she had seen, even though the testimony of a woman at that time was not considered valid.|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{behavioral}} determinants that underlie cancer patients’ intention to <b>express</b> <b>concerns</b> during a consultation. This information can be relevant to developing effective interventions for cancer patients. In this study, the integrative model of behavioral prediction (IMBP) is used as a framework to unravel the determinants of patients’ intention to <b>express</b> <b>concerns.</b> The objectives of this study are to examine which of the IMBP determinants (attitude, perceived social norm, and/or self-efficacy) are significantly related to intention and what content of these determinants can be targeted to effect a change in patients’ intention. An online survey based on the IMBP determinants was distributed. A total of 236 cancer patients and cancer survivors participated. The results of the survey showed that patients’ attitudes and perceived social norm were the most important determinants of their intention to <b>express</b> <b>concerns.</b> The largest change in patients’ intention might be achieved by targeting the affective attitude, referring {{to the extent to which}} patients believe that <b>expressing</b> <b>concerns</b> is (un) pleasant, and the social norm, referring to the extent to which patients feel (un) supported by significant others in <b>expressing</b> <b>concerns...</b>|$|R
