5|$|According to Pauling's first rule, {{successive}} pK {{values of}} a given acid increase (pKa2 > pKa1). For oxyacids {{with more than one}} ionizable hydrogen on the same atom, the pKa values often increase by about 5 units for each proton removed, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> of phosphoric acid above.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotic drug {{design is}} {{facilitated}} when an enzyme {{that is essential}} to the pathogen's survival is absent or very different in humans. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> above, humans do not make peptidoglycan, therefore inhibitors of this process are selectively toxic to bacteria. Selective toxicity is also produced in antibiotics by exploiting differences {{in the structure of the}} ribosomes in bacteria, or how they make fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{constrain}} a column to reject Nulls, the NOT NULL constraint can be applied, as shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> below. The NOT NULL constraint is semantically {{equivalent to a}} check constraint with an IS NOT NULL predicate.|$|E

5|$|The {{complexity}} of an appropriation {{depends upon the}} city council's preferences; real-world appropriations can list hundreds of line item amounts. An appropriation is the legal authority for spending given by the city council to the various agencies of the city government. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> above, the city can {{spend as much as}} $34 million, but smaller appropriation limits have also been established for individual programs and departments.|$|E
5|$|When a {{compound}} has limited {{solubility in water}} it is common practice (in the pharmaceutical industry, for example) to determine pKa values in a solvent mixture such as water/dioxane or water/methanol, in which the compound is more soluble. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> shown at the right, the pKa value rises steeply with increasing percentage of dioxane as the dielectric constant of the mixture is decreasing.|$|E
5|$|Zugzwang, disadvantageous {{since it}} forces {{a player to}} move, is often a factor in endgames but rarely in other stages of the game. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> diagram, either side having the move is in zugzwang: Black to move must play 1...Kb7 {{allowing}} White to promote the pawn after 2.Kd7; White to move must permit a draw, either by 1.Kc6 stalemate or by losing the pawn after any other legal move.|$|E

5|$|Coherent {{units are}} derived units that contain no {{numerical}} factor other than 1—quantities such as standard gravity and density of water are absent from their definitions. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> above, one newton is the force required to accelerate {{a mass of}} one kilogram by one metre per second squared. Since the SI units of mass and acceleration are kg and m·s−2 respectively and , the units of force (and hence of newtons) is formed by multiplication to give kg·m·s−2. Since the newton {{is part of a}} coherent set of units, the constant of proportionality is 1.|$|E
5|$|The {{long term}} {{stability}} of anti-aligned extreme trans-Neptunian objects with orbits that intersect that of Planet Nine {{is the result}} of their resonant dynamics. Objects in mean-motion resonances with a massive planet are phase protected, preventing them from making close approaches to the planet. When the orbit of a resonant object drifts out of phase,} causing it to make closer approaches to a massive planet, the changes in the perturbations the planet exerts on the object alters its semi-major axis in the direction that reverses the drift. This process repeats as the drift continues in the other direction causing the orbit to appear to rock back and forth, or librate, about a stable center when viewed in a rotating frame of reference. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> at right, when the orbit of a plutino drifts backward it loses angular momentum when it makes closer approaches ahead of Neptune, causing its semi-major axis and period to shrink, reversing the drift.|$|E
5|$|The {{right-hand}} {{side of the}} above equation is the sure information, i.e. information which can be certainly extracted from the database regardless of what values are used to replace Nulls in the database. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> we considered above, it's {{easy to see that}} the intersection of all possible models (i.e. the sure information) of the query selecting WHERE Age = 22 is actually empty because, for instance, the (unlifted) query returns no rows for the relation EmpH37. More generally, it was shown by Imielinski and Lipski that Codd tables are a weak representation system if the query language is restricted to projections, selections (and renaming of columns). However, as soon as we add either joins or unions to the query language, even this weak property is lost, as evidenced in the next section.|$|E
