5000|$|Bright Pointer (Buraito Pointā): At first B-Fighter Genji's weapon. Later {{given to}} B-Fighter Tentou, who can attach {{it to the}} top of the Input Cardgun and fire the Bright Flash (Buraito Furasshu) and the Maintenance Ray (Mentenansu Rei), used to ruin or restore. Also usable as a tranquilizer. Attaching it to the Input Cardgun, it can fire the Impact Flash (Inpakuto Furasshu) and the <b>Flash</b> <b>Barrier</b> (Furasshu Baria).|$|E
2500|$|Portugal's level {{crossings}} (passagem de nível in Portuguese) have bells, but most {{do not have}} lights. Two alternating flashing lights accompany the barriers, which can be manual or automatic. They also have a sign saying [...] "pare ao sinal vermelho" [...] (stop the red light). When activated, the bells ring, the lights <b>flash,</b> the <b>barriers</b> come down and the bells continue to ring.|$|R
50|$|Accidents and {{near-misses}} occur frequently at the 100 or so unbarriered level crossings. The SüdostBayernBahn {{is therefore}} seeking {{to protect the}} unsupervised road crossings increasingly with <b>flashing</b> lights and <b>barriers.</b> On 14 August 2008 two motor scooter riders were struck by trains at different places {{on the line and}} killed.|$|R
40|$|Issues of {{accessibility}} and usability {{in relation}} to interactive multimedia Web content are discussed; in particular applications producing animation on the Web, such as <b>Flash</b> movies. The <b>barriers</b> that these types of technologies cause to some assistive technology users is mentioned, but it is stressed that with a pragmatic and proactive approach at the design initiation stage, {{it is possible to}} ensure that many more people can enjoy the rich media that the Web has to offer {{on a wide range of}} devices...|$|R
25|$|Irish level {{crossings}} (crosaire comhréidh in Irish) {{are similar to}} UK {{level crossings}}, {{in the fact that}} they have a preliminary amber light before the red lights start <b>flashing</b> and the <b>barriers</b> descend (one example at Wexford does not have an amber light). Crossings are the same on the whole island of Ireland, and are either of the old gated variant, or are automatic. Ireland does have automatic crossings that have full barriers, which are not seen in the UK. The audible alarms are unique to the country.|$|R
40|$|Railway level {{crossings}} {{have the potential}} to bring motor vehicles and trains into fatal contact. In Australia there are approximately 9, 400 public railway {{level crossings}} across the country, protected either passively (64 %) or by active/automated systems (28 %). Passive crossings provide only a stationary sign warning of the possibility of trains crossing. Their message remains constant over time. Active systems, by contrast, activate automatic warning devices (i. e., <b>flashing</b> lights, bells, <b>barrier,</b> etc.) as a train approaches. Using a driving simulator, this paper compares driver compliance at railway level crossings equipped with either active or passive warning devices including a stop sign, rumble strips, flashing lights/bell and in-vehicle auditory warning. This paper describes the driving simulator data collection and findings and subsequently draws conclusions on driver compliance with respect to different types of warning devices. The results indicate that drivers behave differently and are more compliant at active crossings than at passive crossings...|$|R
40|$|Railway level {{crossings}} create serious potential conflict points for collisions between road vehicles and trains producing {{one of the}} most severe in all traffic crash types. There are approximately 9, 400 public railway {{level crossings}} in Australia. They are protected either passively (64 %) or by active/automated systems (28 %). Passive protection systems provide only a stationary sign warning of the possibility of trains crossing. Their message remains constant with time. Active protection systems activate automatic warning devices (i. e., <b>flashing</b> lights, bells, <b>barrier,</b> etc.) as they detect an approaching train. This paper evaluates driver compliance towards different protection systems at railway level crossings. Field data collection using video recording was conducted to measure driver responses at crossings with different protection systems, namely: stop sign, flashing lights/bell and half boom-barrier with flashing lights. This paper describes the field data collection and analysis and subsequently draws conclusions on driver compliance with respect to different types of protection systems. The results indicate that drivers behave differently and are more compliant at actively protected crossings than at passively protected crossings...|$|R
40|$|Rail level {{crossings}} {{are designed to}} promote safety at road–rail interfaces, but also create the opportunity for conflicts between the two modes of transport. Some of these conflicts can occur due to risk taking behaviour and decision-making errors of road users and represent a significant safety risk. Comparatively {{little is known about}} causes of risk-taking behaviour specific to remote locations or regions where the road traffic is dominated by long road vehicles with extremely heavy loads, such as mining and resources traffic. The trains operating in these areas may be up to 3. 2 km long and can take a very long time to pass through a crossing. In these circumstances, people must adapt to a very different mode of rail level crossing use than in less remote locations. The current approach to improve safety at road–rail intersections in Australia is to upgrade {{level crossings}} with a full complement of active and automatic protection, including boom <b>barriers,</b> <b>flashing</b> lights, bells, and advanced warning signals. However, crashes still occur despite the active protection being operational. The Pilbara region of Western Australia {{is an example of a}} remote location with intense mining and resources traffic and, with an abundance of rail operations, numerous level crossings. Anecdotal evidence suggests that level crossing strikes and near misses are a particular safety concern in this region. Given the significance of the Pilbara region to Australia’s economy, problems with traffic flow may hinder opportunities for continued growth enabled by increased reliability and automation of service delivery. Determining the causes of collisions at level crossings in this region is the focus of a mixed-methodological investigation, with the aim of providing potential controls that may reduce or mitigate these occurrences. The research approach discussed is centred on a desktop analysis of level crossing incidents reported by mining companies and an observation structure designed to maximise the efficiency of site visits. Preliminary trends in the data emerging from the first phase of the research include the prevalence of heavy vehicles...|$|R
