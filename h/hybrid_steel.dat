40|$|High {{strength}} concrete has higher strength but lower ductility. Inclusion of single type of fibers into concrete {{has been proven}} to improve the behavior of concrete to a limited extent. However, recently {{it was found that}} the behavior of concrete can be improved more with the addition of hybrid fiber i. e., a combination of different types of fiber. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on the behavior of <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Steel</b> Fibre Reinforced High Strength Concrete (HSFR-HSC). A total of eight cylinder specimens with 150 mm in diameter and 300 mm in height were cast and tested under uniaxial compression. Three different combinations of HSFR-HSC specimens and reference specimens without steel fibers were prepared. The first combination of HSFR-HSC included 1. 5 % Micro Steel (MS) fibers and 1 % Deformed Steel (DS) fibers. The second combination included 1. 5 % MS fibers and 1. 5 % Hooked-end Steel (HS) fibers. The third combination included 1 % DS fibers and 1. 5 % HS fibers. The experimental results showed that the addition of <b>hybrid</b> <b>steel</b> fibers improved the strength and ductility of high {{strength concrete}} compared to the reference specimens.

40|$|Abstract — A {{new class}} of high {{strength}} steel with excellent toughness, ductility, and good weldability is emerging world-wide, named as High Performance Steel (HPS). HPS can be designed as having an optimized balance of these properties to give maximum performance in bridge structures while remaining cost-effective. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>steel</b> girder, comprising mild steel for top flange and web, and HPS for bottom flange, has outstanding potential for steel-concrete composite bridge. A study is performed to compare the cost differences between bridge designs using conventional mild steel Fe 410, high tensile steel Fe 590 and {{a combination of the}} two grades of steel. Two cases of span supported and un-supported during construction are considered for comparison. Maximum flexural stresses, maximum deflection, weight and cost are compared for 40 m span steel-concrete composite bridge for both the unsupported and supported conditions of the bridge span during construction. It has been found that <b>hybrid</b> <b>steel</b> girders are most economical, for which there is a saving of about 34. 7 % in steel weight and 29. 1 % in steel cost in comparison to the mild steel girder bridge for the un-supported span case, while in supported span case it is 50 % and 46 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{numerical}} and analytical in-vestigation on <b>hybrid</b> <b>steel</b> truss RC beams are described. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>steel</b> truss RC beams are beams where, during the construction phase and the concrete casting (Phase I), the steel truss sys-tem only carries the vertical loads.

In the present study, four different beams are considered, with different steel trusses in Phase I condition. Finite Element modelizations of the structure are made and failure loads are obtained, taking into account second-order effects due to large displacements. It is shown that the stability of the steel truss strongly depends on the lateral stiffness of the diagonal elements of the truss. Analytical models for the prediction of the fail-ure load are proposed, based on the instability of a beam on elastic foundation and the lateral buck-ling due to bending moment.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{article focuses}} on the {{experimental}} investigation carried out on controllability of structural performance of RC panels modified with optimal fiber hybridization system (<b>hybrid</b> combination of <b>steel</b> and polypropylene fibers) up to a volume fraction of 1. 0 %. Strength effectiveness of the mechanical properties, namely, compressive and splitting tensile strength {{as well as the}} structural performance of RC panels modified with optimal fiber hybridization system were studied. The results clarify that the optimal fiber hybridization system is seen to enhance the strength effectiveness of mechanical properties, the controllability-efficient of structural performance of RC panels as cracking behavior, and load–deflection curves, causing an increase in flexural ductility, toughness, and load-carrying capacity. Consequently, the <b>hybrid</b> combination of <b>steel</b> and polypropylene fibers can be used instead of individual fibers, in which innovation and responsible application of concrete construction technology results in better efficiency of the composite.

40|$|The {{fatigue testing}} of welded tubular nodes and cast <b>steel</b> <b>hybrid</b> nodes under random loading and {{corrosion}} in artificial seawater shows {{clearly that the}} fatigue strength of the cast <b>steel</b> <b>hybrid</b> nodes is superior {{to that of the}} welded tubular nodes. This is related to the advantageous design of the cast steel inserts, as a result of which the high stress concentrations are substantially reduced and the welds transferred to areas of lower and, therefore, noncritical, stresses. The fact that the phase of crack propagation of the tubular nodes is many times longer than the fatigue life to crack initiation, provides a considerable reserve in fatigue design based on crack initiation. This makes it possible to detect damage at an early stage during routine inspections and thus to prevent serious failures. Concerning the design, however, emphasis should in any case be placed primarily on an increase of the fatigue life to crack initiation. In this respect, the use of cast steel inserts is an advantageous possibility...|$|R

The {{influence of the}} type, volume content and aspect ratio (length to diameter ratio) of steel fibres on the strength and ductility of HSC columns were investigated by testing 16 circular specimens of 200 mm diameter and 800 mm height. All the specimens were reinforced with {{the same amount of}} longitudinal and helical steel reinforcement. The specimens were divided into four groups (Group RC, Group MI, Group MA and Group HY) of four specimens. Group RC specimens contained no steel fibres, Group MI specimens contained 3 % by volume of micro steel fibres, Group MA specimens contained 2 % by volume of macro steel fibres, and Group HY specimens contained 2. 5 % by volume of <b>hybrid</b> <b>steel</b> fibres (1. 5 % of micro steel fibres and 1 % of macro steel fibres). A total of 12 specimens were tested as columns with different eccentricities (concentric axial load, 25 mm and 50 mm eccentric axial loads) and four specimens were tested as beams under four-point bending. In addition to the experimental work, analytical studies were conducted to develop axial load-bending moment interaction diagrams of Groups RC, MI, MA and HY using the equivalent rectangular stress block method and layer-by-layer integration method. Also, bending moment-curvature diagrams of the specimens tested under 25 mm and 50 mm eccentric axial load were developed using layer-by-layer integration method. The experimental results showed that the inclusion of micro steel fibres and <b>hybrid</b> <b>steel</b> fibres into HSC (Group MI and Group HY) enhanced the strength and ductility of the specimens under eccentric axial loads. The results also showed that the addition of macro steel fibres into HSC (Group MA) enhanced the ductility but reduced the strength of the specimens compared to Group RC specimens. The analytical axial load-bending moment interaction diagrams underestimated the corresponding experimental axial load-bending moment interaction diagrams. Also, the analytical axial load-bending moment interaction diagrams constructed from the layer-by-layer method were close to the experimental axial load-bending moment interaction diagrams. In addition, the analytical bending moment-curvature diagrams were in good agreement with the corresponding experimental bending moment-curvature diagrams...|$|E
