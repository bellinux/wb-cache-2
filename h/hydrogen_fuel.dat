5|$|Astronomers {{estimate}} that the Solar System {{as we know it}} today will not change drastically until the Sun has fused almost all the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> in its core into helium, beginning its evolution from the main sequence of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and into its red-giant phase. Even so, the Solar System will continue to evolve until then.|$|E
5|$|The {{characteristics}} of the resulting star depend primarily upon its starting mass. The more massive the star, the greater its luminosity, and the more rapidly it fuses its <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> into helium in its core. Over time, this <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> is completely converted into helium, and the star begins to evolve. The fusion of helium requires a higher core temperature. A star with a high enough core temperature will push its outer layers outward while increasing its core density. The resulting red giant formed by the expanding outer layers enjoys a brief life span, before the helium fuel in the core is in turn consumed. Very massive stars can also undergo a series of evolutionary phases, as they fuse increasingly heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 3.43, Beta Pavonis is the second-brightest {{star in the}} constellation. A white giant of spectral class A7III, it is an aging star that has used up the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> at its core and has expanded and cooled after moving off the main sequence. It lies 135 light years away from the Solar System.|$|E

To support commercialization of hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles by Toyota and other manufacturers, the Japanese government announced a goal to build approximately 100 <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fueling</b> stations by March 2016 in Japanese cities where the vehicles were to be launched initially. By May 2016, there were approximately 80 <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fueling</b> stations in Japan. California had ten <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fueling</b> stations in 2015, and the government provided about $47 million for 28 additional stations there.|$|R

5|$|A third Saturn IB test, AS-203 {{launched}} from pad 37, went into orbit to support {{design of the}} S-IVB upper stage restart capability needed for the Saturn V. It carried a nosecone instead of the Apollo spacecraft, and its payload was the unburned liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel,</b> the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors, and a TV camera. This flight occurred on July 5, before AS-202, which was delayed because of problems getting the Apollo spacecraft ready for flight.|$|E
5|$|All {{projections}} {{of the future of}} the Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe must account for the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or a loss of the energy available to do work, must increase over time. Stars will eventually exhaust their supply of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> and burn out. Close encounters gravitationally fling planets from their star systems, and star systems from galaxies.|$|E
5|$|The SABRE engine design aims {{to avoid}} the {{historic}} weight-performance issue by {{using some of the}} liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> to cool helium within a closed-cycle precooler, which quickly reduces the temperature of the air at the inlet. The air is then used for combustion in a similar manner to a conventional jet engine; once the helium has left the pre-cooler, it is further heated by the products of the pre-burner, giving it enough energy to drive the turbine and the liquid hydrogen pump. As a consequence of the air being cooled at all speeds, the jet can be built of light alloys and the weight is roughly halved. Additionally, more fuel can be burnt at high speeds. Beyond Mach5.5, the air would normally become unusably hot despite the cooling; accordingly, the air inlet is closed upon attaining this speed and the engine instead is solely fed via on-board liquid oxygen and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel,</b> as in a traditional rocket.|$|E

5|$|Research is also {{undertaken}} {{in this field}} of artificial photosynthesis. It {{involves the use of}} nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds, by splitting water to produce <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> or then combining with carbon dioxide to make biopolymers such as methanol. Many large national and regional research projects on artificial photosynthesis are now trying to develop techniques integrating improved light capture, quantum coherence methods of electron transfer and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions. Senior researchers in the field have made the public policy case for a Global Project on Artificial Photosynthesis to address critical energy security and environmental sustainability issues.|$|E
5|$|The plug-in segment sales {{remained}} flat in 2014 with 30,390 units sold, and {{a market}} share of 1.06% of total new car sales in the country (kei cars not included). Sales totaled 24,660 units in 2015, consisting of 10,420 all-electrics and 14,190 plug-in hybrids. The {{rate of growth of}} the Japanese plug-in segment slowed down from 2013, with annual sales falling behind Europe, the U.S. and China during 2014 and 2015. The decline in plug-in car sales reflects the Japanese government and the major domestic carmakers decision to adopt and promote <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> cell vehicles instead of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{total amount}} of energy that a star can {{generate}} through nuclear fusion of hydrogen {{is limited by the}} amount of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> that can be consumed at the core. For a star in equilibrium, the energy generated at the core must be at least equal to the energy radiated at the surface. Since the luminosity gives the amount of energy radiated per unit time, the total life span can be estimated, to first approximation, as the total energy produced divided by the star's luminosity.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} in the future, IK Pegasi A will consume the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> at its core and start to evolve away from the main {{sequence}} to form a red giant. The envelope of a red giant can grow to significant dimensions, extending up to a hundred times its previous radius (or larger). Once IK Pegasi A expands to the point where its outer envelope overflows the Roche lobe of its companion, a gaseous accretion disk will form around the white dwarf. This gas, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, will then accrete onto the surface of the companion. This mass transfer between the stars will also cause their mutual orbit to shrink.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} this process has been a steady {{increase}} in the energy output of the Sun. When the Sun first became a main sequence star, it radiated only 70% of the current luminosity. The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present, rising by 1% every 110 million years. Likewise, in three billion years the Sun {{is expected to be}} 33% more luminous. The <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> at the core will finally be exhausted in five billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more luminous than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the luminosity reaches 121% above the present value. This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter it will pass through the subgiant stage and evolve into a red giant.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> at {{the core}} of the {{progenitor}} of IK Pegasi B was consumed, it evolved into a red giant. The inner core contracted until hydrogen burning commenced in a shell surrounding the helium core. To compensate for the temperature increase, the outer envelope expanded to many times the radius it possessed as a main sequence star. When the core reached a temperature and density where helium could start to undergo fusion this star contracted and became what is termed a horizontal branch star. That is, it belonged to a group of stars that fall upon a roughly horizontal line on the H-R diagram. The fusion of helium formed an inert core of carbon and oxygen. When helium was exhausted in the core a helium-burning shell formed in addition to the hydrogen-burning one and the star moved to what astronomers term the asymptotic giant branch, or AGB. (This is a track leading to the upper-right corner of the H-R diagram.) If the star had sufficient mass, in time carbon fusion could begin in the core, producing oxygen, neon and magnesium.|$|E
50|$|As of 2017, {{there was}} limited {{hydrogen}} infrastructure, with 36 <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fueling</b> stations for automobiles publicly {{available in the}} U.S., but more hydrogen stations are planned, particularly in California.

5|$|Beta Hydri, the {{brightest}} star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth. It has about 104% of the mass of the Sun and 181% of the Sun's radius, with {{more than three times the}} Sun's luminosity. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G2IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating this is a subgiant star. As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant star to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun may look like in the far distant future, making it an object of interest to astronomers. It is also the closest bright star to the south celestial pole.|$|E
5|$|In {{the long}} term, the {{greatest}} {{changes in the}} Solar System will come from changes in the Sun itself as it ages. As the Sun burns through its supply of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel,</b> it gets hotter and burns the remaining fuel even faster. As a result, the Sun is growing brighter {{at a rate of}} ten percent every 1.1billion years. In one billion years' time, as the Sun's radiation output increases, its circumstellar habitable zone will move outwards, making the Earth's surface too hot for liquid water to exist there naturally. At this point, all life on land will become extinct. Evaporation of water, a potent greenhouse gas, from the oceans' surface could accelerate temperature increase, potentially ending all life on Earth even sooner. During this time, it is possible that as Mars's surface temperature gradually rises, carbon dioxide and water currently frozen under the surface regolith will release into the atmosphere, creating a greenhouse effect that will heat the planet until it achieves conditions parallel to Earth today, providing a potential future abode for life. By 3.5billion years from now, Earth's surface conditions will be similar to those of Venus today.|$|E
5|$|Three star {{systems have}} been {{discovered}} to have exoplanets. HD 111232 is a yellow main sequence star around 78% as massive as the Sun around 95light-years distant. It has a planet (HD 111232 b) around 6.8times the mass of Jupiter that has an orbital period of around 1143 days. HD 112410 is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III located around 439light-years distant. With around 1.54times the mass of our Sun, it is cooling and expanding along the red giant branch, having left the main sequence after exhausting its core supply of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel.</b> It has a substellar companion calculated to have a mass 9.2times that of Jupiter and an orbital period of 124.6days {{at a distance of}} approximately 0.57 AU. Yet another member of the Lower Centaurus Crux subgroup, HD 100546 is a young blue-white Herbig Ae/Be star of spectral type B9V that has yet to settle on the main sequence—the closest of these stars to Earth at around 320light-years distant. It is surrounded by a circumstellar debris disk from a distance of 0.2 to 4AU, and again from 13AU out to a few hundred AU, with evidence for a protoplanet forming at a distance of around 47AU.
