5|$|I {{have come}} to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a real {{difference}} between the regular German soldier and officer and Hitler and his criminal group. For my part, I {{do not believe that}} the German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers.|$|E
5|$|The central {{discussion}} {{within the}} poem is {{on the nature of}} time and salvation. Eliot emphasises the need of the individual to focus on the present moment and to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a universal order. By understanding the nature of time and the order of the universe, mankind is able to recognise God and seek redemption. Many reviewers of Burnt Norton focused on the uniqueness and beauty of the poem. However, others complained that the poem does not reflect Eliot's earlier greatness and that the use of Christian themes harmed the poem.|$|E
5|$|Fates is {{primarily}} {{set in the}} territories of the kingdoms of Hoshido and Nohr. Their royalty share a similar line of descent from ancient dragons, but each kingdom worships different dragon deities, and so exist {{in a state of}} war. Little do they <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is also another dragon deity; the dragon Anankos, ruler of the kingdom of Valla. This realm is located under the Bottomless Canyon which separates Hoshido and Nohr. Anankos has usurped the throne of Valla and is intentionally provoking war between the two kingdoms. In the Hidden Truths DLC, it is revealed that Anankos was formerly a kind dragon who gave wisdom to humanity, but his growing power and inability to ascend to the spirit realm with the world's other dragons began corrupting him. After he killed Valla's king in an uncontrolled fit of bestial rage, he finally went mad: his remaining sanity and kindness took temporary shelter in a human form and fathered the Avatar before dying, while his dragon self began an insane crusade to destroy humanity.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately the English {{readers and}} many of those other {{countries}} who had translated Benzoni's earlier works, were not so fortunate to read Benzoni's other historical novels or Mystery novels (The Aldo Morosini adventures).

25|$|I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{are many}} in {{opposition}} to integration. I appreciate their concern about maintaining the cultural and religious identity of our nation. However, I must emphasise that Poland {{has always been an}} important part of Europe. Europe needs Poland. The Church in Europe needs the Poles' testimony of faith. Poland needs Europe.|$|E
25|$|Johnny tells Minny {{that it is}} not too {{difficult}} to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> has been a change at the house, how appreciative he is about her friendship with Celia, how it saved her life, and that she has job security. This act gives Minny the courage to take her children away from her abusive husband.|$|E
25|$|The layouts of both {{floors of}} “Maxim’s” have been preserved.

We have no specific information about the décor, the evidence is scarce. We only <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were metal columns and many lamps of various colours in the house, the contemporaries also mention the glass floor with inbuilt lights.|$|E

25|$|Shelter {{employees}} are sometimes {{at risk from}} violence perpetrated by the clients they are serving. In order to address problems faced by employees {{who are trying to}} help the homeless in New York, the Department of Homeland Security increased security at some shelters and conducted security assessments of shelters in 2015. While many employees of shelters <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a risk when working in high-crime neighborhoods or with individuals who are mentally ill, they continue to work at homeless shelters because they feel that they are performing a public service akin to the police or firefighters.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} some things {{for which it is}} not enough to state a single cause, but several, of which one, however, is the case. Just as if you were to see the lifeless corpse of a man lying far away, it would be fitting to list all the causes of death in order to make sure that the single cause of this death may be stated. For you would not be able to {{establish}} conclusively that he died by the sword or of cold or of illness or perhaps by poison, but we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is something of this kind that happened to him.|$|E
25|$|As smoke {{began to}} escape the Zebra Room and drift {{down the hall toward}} other banquet rooms, patrons and {{employees}} in the rooms nearest to the Zebra Room smelled it. The employees began to verbally urge room occupants to leave the building; however, as the sprawling complex lacked an audible fire alarm, those in further-flung rooms had no way to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a fire in the building until an employee walked the length of the building alerting them. Fire investigators later estimated that, once through the northern doors of the Zebra Room, the fire took only two to five minutes to enter the Cabaret Room; as a result, news of the fire and the first of the smoke and flame reached the Cabaret Room, the farthest point from the Zebra Room, nearly simultaneously. By the time busboy Walter Bailey arrived in the Cabaret Room and interrupted the show to order an evacuation at 9:06p.m., there was very little time left for the audience of around a thousand people to make their way through the room's small number of exits. As it spread laterally, the fire also began to spread upwards, engulfing the spiral staircase that would have provided the best exit for those {{on the second floor of}} the building.|$|E

500|$|Hill did {{not want}} an {{extensive}} tour because of obligations to her family and the difficulties she experienced touring with the Fugees in 1996, which she found desensitizing and isolating. According to Hill biographer Chris Nickson in 1999, [...] "there was the possibility of more dates being added... but {{it was unlikely that}} Lauryn would be willing to make the tour more grueling and draining. She'd come to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was much more to life than a career." ...|$|E
500|$|... {{definitely}} {{paved the}} way for the filmmakers and distributors of the world to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a female audience that was really strong out there", Gabler recalls, one that was not segmented by age. She pointed to later movies, such as Mamma Mia!, 27 Dresses (written by McKenna) and Me Before You, that appeared to her to be trying to replicate The Devil Wears Pradas success with that demographic. However, Gabler feels they did not do so as well. [...] "Prada reminds me of movies that we don't have a lot of now—it harkens back to classic movies that had so much more than just one kind of plot line ... You just keep wanting to find something that can touch upon the same zeitgeist as this film." ...|$|E

500|$|It was {{not until}} after the victory at the Battle of Rafa that Chauvel was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George, but this {{particular}} order is awarded for important non-military service in a foreign country. It was not just his military service at Romani which had not been recognised, but also the service {{of all those who}} fought in the Anzac Mounted Division at Romani, at El Arish, at Magdhaba and at Rafa. In September 1917, not long after General Edmund Allenby became Commander in Chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, Chauvel wrote to GHQ to point out the injustice done to his front-line troops, acknowledging that it was [...] "difficult to do anything now to right this, but consider the Commander-in-Chief should <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{is a great deal of}} bitterness over it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} to [...] "Ya Soshla S Uma" [...] {{was directed by}} Shapovalov, and was shot at the Khodynka Field in Moscow between 4–7 September 2000. Preparation for the visual consisted of both Volkova and Katina covering themselves in dark-tanning lotion and getting haircuts. Over 90 people were present on set, including extra actors, whilst some members had designed a large brick wall by painting abstract patterns and colors to it. According to Shapovalov, the wall itself cost approximately $3000 USD. After shooting {{the majority of the}} scenes in Khodynka Field, Shapovalov moved the wall and iron fence to Kutuzov Avenue, Moscow, in order to shot frames of traffic until the camera changed its focus on the girls again. Shapovalov stated that he wanted the viewers to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a [...] "world behind the crowd of people." [...] The video was broadcast in Russia and Europe in early December 2000 on MTV.|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to being}} cast on Knots Landing, Mills was {{predominantly}} known for playing [...] "damsel in distress" [...] roles, {{which is why}} the producers didn't initially consider her. Abby's storylines focused on business dealings, affairs and family troubles. Introduced as the sister of Sid Fairgate, she was initially portrayed as a friendly, warm-hearted woman with great love for her children. In due time, she evolved into the series' main antagonist, constantly causing mayhem in others' lives. According to series creator David Jacobs, the producers always intended Abby to be a J.R. Ewing-esque character. Jacobs said, [...] "When we were casting the role of Abby, we were looking for a homey type, someone whom the other women characters would trust. It was our intention to have this nice person gain the trust of the other women and then cause trouble for them. We didn't want the other characters and the audience to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a scheming person under this nice facade. We wanted her to come on as a good person and then evolve into a vixen." ...|$|E
