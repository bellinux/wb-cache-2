500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>whether</b> I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of people and I enjoy that. Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|E

The Afghan Infrastructure Fund {{has been plagued}} with problems, with millions of taxpayer dollars disappearing. When {{another member of the}} House said the funding was essential to bringing our troops home, Cohen replied “The {{truth of the matter is}} that it has nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>whether</b> we can bring our troops home or not. [...] The truth is that we cannot account for where this money is going, and it is likely going into the pockets of the top one-half of one percent in Afghanistan. [...] The infrastructure holds up well enough there to deploy and redeploy our troops, so it’s good enough to bring them home permanently.” The Amendment passed 228–191 and is the first piece of legislation reducing funding to Afghanistan.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2002, it was {{announced}} that Bradley Bell had decided to kill off Taylor, and Tylo would depart the role after twelve years. In a statement on her website, she wrote: [...] "It is with great sadness I {{have to tell you that}} Brad has decided to kill off the character Taylor. He feels the character is too good and has too much integrity to take her down other pathsin a word, played out." [...] The actress confessed that she was unhappy with her character's direction at the time of her exit, saying: [...] "I really felt like Taylor had lost the wind from her sails and was going nowhere." [...] Tylo said that [...] "It just seemed like everything had to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>whether</b> or not there was a woman after her husband" [...] and that she was [...] "done with it", revealing that her unhappiness with the writing began when the character of Morgan appeared on the show. Furthermore, both Tylo and Bell agreed that Taylor was at a [...] "brick wall", but Bell was [...] "afraid to go beyond that" [...] and have the character go [...] "off the deep end", in fear of destroying her integrity. However, Tylo believed that [...] "in reality that's what she needed – to be more human. But she just got boring instead". Taylor is gunned down by Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) and appears to die in hospital a few days later due to her injuries. Tylo eventually returned to the soap, with Taylor revealed to be alive in 2005.|$|E

2500|$|The trouble though is, {{that this}} productive/unproductive {{distinction}} {{is not easily}} made in practice, given changes in the market, in social-organizational efficiency, and in production techniques, {{and it does not}} necessarily have anything to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>whether</b> a worker produces something tangible or not. What looks like an efficiency gain from [...] "weeding out" [...] seemingly unproductive activity may in fact not be an efficiency gain in total, or it may be very difficult to prove that it is. If fewer workers are made to do more work, intensifying labor, then accidents, illness or errors may increase. In the real world, technical efficiency and financial efficiency are not necessarily the same thing at all. Hence there is continual debate in management theory about these issues, with few [...] "general" [...] answers being available, since much depends on the specific organizational technique of enterprises. The only [...] "general" [...] answer there is, is to recast the accounting for every detailed activity that workers perform as a statistically observable input-output relationship which results in a [...] "product", even if the [...] "product" [...] is no real product at all, but some kind of service or performance result. By describing a labor-service or a task performance as a product, it seems identifiably productive, although substantively it may not create any new product. In Marxist theory, this is called the [...] "commodification of services": each specific service is accounted for as a specific alienable product with a certain price tag, and managed accordingly. Eventually, many services which have to be performed by trained staff are replaced by mass-produced things, because that is more profitable and cheaper to buy. For example, a teacher is replaced with an instruction video.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the case}} {{of what is called}} Browning's obscurity, the {{question}} is somewhat more difficult to handle. Many people have supposed Browning to be profound because he was obscure, and many other people, hardly less mistaken, have supposed him to be obscure because he was profound. He was frequently profound, he was occasionally obscure, but {{as a matter of fact}} the two have little or nothing to do with each other. Browning's dark and elliptical mode of speech, like his love of the grotesque, was simply a characteristic of his, a trick of is temperament, and had little or nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>whether</b> what he was expressing was profound or superficial. Suppose, for example, that a person well read in English poetry but unacquainted with Browning's style were earnestly invited to consider the following verse:-- ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} smiling on GOAT fronting, a sound change common to many varieties of American English. The data are audiovisual re-cordings of ten speakers of American English recorded in dyadic conversations in an interactional sociophonetics laboratory. We applied an existing computer vision algorithm for smile detection to the video recordings to identify smiling intervals. A mixed-effects linear regression reveals that higher F 2 (i. e., auditorily fronter GOAT) positively corre-lates <b>with</b> <b>whether</b> speakers are smiling while articulating the vowel and their self-reported com-fort levels in the interaction. The latter factor <b>does</b> not correlate <b>with</b> <b>whether</b> vowels were smiled. To-gether, {{the findings suggest that}} GOAT fronting is not only a phonetic consequence of smiling, but also serves an affective, interactional function. While sociophonetic studies typically analyze audio record-ings alone, patterns of variation are better explained by also attending to embodied practices observable only in the visual domain...|$|R
