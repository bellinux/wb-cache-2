40|$|The Mobile Integrated Temporary Utility System (MITUS) {{integrates}} portable {{electrical power}} along with communications and emergency alarm and lighting capabilities to provide safe, centralized power to work areas {{that need to}} be de-energized for decommissioning work. MITUS consists of a portable unit substation; up to twenty portable kiosks that house the <b>power</b> <b>receptacles,</b> communications, and emergency alarm and lighting systems; and a central communications unit. This system makes sequential decommissioning efforts efficient and cost-effective by allowing the integrated system to remain intact while being moved to subsequent work sites. Use of the MITUS also eliminates the need to conduct zero-energy tests and implement associated lock-out/tag-out procedures at partially de-energized facilities. Since the MITUS is a designed system, it can be customized to accommodate unique facility conditions simply by varying kiosks and transformer configurations. The MITUS is an attractive alternate to the use of portable generators with stand-alone communications and emergency system. It is more cost-effective than upgrading or reconfiguring existing power distribution systems...|$|R
5000|$|Bender was {{designed}} specifically for the relatively simple task of bending straight metal girders into various angles. Despite this apparent simplicity, he possesses numerous features superfluous to his original purpose, which become more apparent after an electric jolt to his antenna from an overhead light socket in the pilot episode. The scope of Bender's functionality is impressive; he often acts {{as if he were}} a multifunctional gadget rather than a special bending machine. Similar to a contemporary computer, he hosts a number of input/output devices: his head has a data socket and remotely operated volume control. His body has a socket for a microphone jack, a dual-socket <b>power</b> <b>receptacle,</b> a reset button, a kill switch, and a self-destruct button. Having the hardware-based self-destruct control on his body, rather than in his software, prevents Bender from committing suicide in [...] "A Head in the Polls" [...] when he pawns everything but his head, grows desperate without it and desires to kill himself.|$|R
