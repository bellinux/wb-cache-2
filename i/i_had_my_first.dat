500|$|Beyoncé {{said that}} she had trouble convincing {{executives}} at Columbia Records to release the album. The singer recounted that it almost was not released: [...] "In 2003, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> solo album. But when I played it through for my record label, they told me I didn't have one hit on my album. I guess they were kinda right, I had five. [...] "Dangerously in Love", [...] "Naughty Girl", [...] "Me, Myself and I", [...] "Baby Boy" [...] and [...] "Crazy in Love"." [...] Since [...] "Dilemma" [...] was concurrently charting atop the Billboard Hot 100, Beyoncé's management released, [...] "Work It Out", one of the songs on the soundtrack to Austin Powers in Goldmember, instead of a single from Dangerously in Love to preclude it from possibly competing with the former.|$|E
500|$|... "Schoolin' Life" [...] is an uptempo R and funk song, which {{contains}} elements of disco and dance-pop. Built on a 1980s-inspired beat, the song's instrumentation includes old school synthesizers, 1980s-sounding drum kits wailing electric guitars, and horns. Music critics, including Jamie Peck of MTV noted that [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] {{was inspired by}} the prime work of Prince, particularly because of its lyrical content, the instruments used, and Knowles' style of singing on it. Lyrically, the song finds Knowles detailing her experiences as she was growing up. In the first verse, she employs guttural vocals to address many life lessons to [...] "20-somethings", [...] "30-somethings", [...] "40-somethings", and [...] "50-somethings". Knowles warns them against some consequences, affirming [...] "time really moves fast" [...] and that growing up fast will leave them wanting more. Knowles also talks about still excelling in a world where parents try to shield everything, [...] "Mom and dad tried to hide the world / Said the world's just too big for a little girl / Eyes wide open can't you see / <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> heels by the age of 13".|$|E
2500|$|Steven D. Cuozzo {{was born}} on January 17, 1950, in Ocean Hill, Brooklyn, New York. [...] He and his brother, Joseph G. Cuozzo, were {{children}} of Lillian (February 19, 1922 - April 1970) and Joseph A. Cuozzo (November 14, 1916 [...] November 29, 1996), a Brooklyn electrical parts factory worker, and lived at 137 Hull St. In describing {{growing up in the}} Italian-Irish neighborhood of Ocean Hill near the J/Z line over Broadway, restaurant critic Cuozzo noted in 2009, [...] "I recall stoop sitting with neighbors and a happy blur of maternal grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins living in the building next door. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> pizza at a joint I recall as Jimmy's, on a corner lost to time a few blocks from home. The place boasted one big window, and the pies were a sublime fusion of gooey cheese and fragrant thyme, an herb I much prefer to oregano." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} a dozen, Francisco. It is owing to you {{we have taken}} these prisoners, and that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> bit of {{excitement}} since I came out here.|$|R
5000|$|After the race, Alonso {{described}} the win as [...] "..a dream come true. I am 22 {{years old and}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> victory. <b>I</b> hope <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a long career with lots more victories". Jean Todt, the Ferrari team's manager, referred to their performance as [...] "disappointing".|$|R
6000|$|... "Worse and worse, Mike! Evidently, the {{governor}} is determined {{to get rid of}} all whose evidence might throw any light on this matter. After what has happened here, and these summary executions, I feel very uncomfortable as to Colonel Mendez. Will you go to the artillery barracks with a message from me that, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> report to write out, I shall not continue the investigations today? Take Pierre with you again." ...|$|R
60|$|When he was {{introduced}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> opportunity of admiring Leonora's extraordinary knowledge of native customs and etiquette.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{can hardly}} say,' I answered. 'Still, I {{should be able}} to think back. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> sore throat this year the night I saw Mr. Irving at the Lyceum, and that was on my wife's birthday, the 3d of October. How long ago is that?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{would teach}} him?" [...] he cried. [...] "Where could I leave him?" [...] he asked, with {{a drop in}} his voice; and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> glimpse of genuine despair. [...] "He steals, you know, alas! Par ta Madonne! I believe he would put poison in your food and mine--the viper!" ...|$|E
60|$|There was no answer. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> scored <b>my</b> <b>first</b> point! For {{the first}} time, the smith wasn't up and ready. The company noticed it. Good effect.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he continued, [...] "I am less to {{you than}} your ivory Hermes or your silver Faun. You will like them always. How long will you like me? Till <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> wrinkle, <b>I</b> suppose. I know, now, that when one loses one's good looks, {{whatever}} they may be, one loses everything. Your picture has taught me that. Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right. Youth {{is the only thing}} worth <b>having.</b> When <b>I</b> find that I am growing old, I shall kill myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had allowed}} him {{more time than}} enough. When <b>I</b> <b>had</b> given <b>my</b> <b>first</b> sitting <b>I</b> {{saw him in the}} studio, and heard it was his second visit there since the day of the girl's disappearance. Those very violent men are always {{changeable}} and irresolute." ...|$|R
60|$|From here <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> view of {{the village}} of caves. A low bluff ran diagonally across {{one end of the}} mesa, and {{in the face of this}} bluff were the mouths of many caves. Zig-zag trails led up to them, and narrow ledges scooped from the face of the soft rock {{connected}} those upon the same level.|$|E
60|$|So {{we passed}} it by, and rode under the very walls {{by way of}} an avenue of {{flowering}} chestnuts, round to the northern side, until we emerged suddenly upon the sands of Po, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> view at close quarters of that mighty river flowing gently about the islands, all thick with willows, that seemed to float upon its gleaming waters.|$|E
60|$|Monna Giuliana and I would linger {{together}} in talk after the painter had gone; {{and this would}} be at about the time that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> lessons of Curial life from my Lord Gambara. You will remember that he mentioned Boccaccio to me, and I chanced to ask her was there in the library a copy of that author's tales.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What, with friend Fidus? no, thank'ee; I am not, by many degrees, honest {{enough to}} suit his book. He would be down on some little public peccadillo of mine before <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{swallowed}} <b>my</b> <b>first</b> egg. Besides, I would not for worlds break {{the pleasure of}} your tête-à-tête.' ...|$|R
60|$|So {{then she}} drew from {{me the story}} of our battle in the brig, which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> omitted in <b>my</b> <b>first</b> account of <b>my</b> affairs.|$|R
60|$|Clark {{had been}} {{standing}} quietly on the bank while <b>I</b> <b>had</b> scalped <b>my</b> <b>first</b> redskin. Then he called Tom McChesney to him and questioned him closely about our journey, the signs we had seen, and, finally, the news in the Watauga settlements. While {{this was going on}} the others gathered round them.|$|R
60|$|I {{recall that}} when this sample came to me by express, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> and only {{conviction}} that my financial worries were over. Even Zulime was impressed with my brother's smelter reports which gave the proportion of gold to the ton, precisely set down in bold black figures. All {{we had to do}} was to ship a sufficient number of car lots for the year and our income would rival that of Carnegie's.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{acted like}} a little man about it," [...] he {{reported}} to Ludlow. [...] "She'll do. When a girl can take a blow like that the way she does, she makes you wish that more fellows were girls. When <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> picture refused, it laid me up. But I'm {{not going to let}} this thing rest. I'm going to see if that picture can't be got into the American Artists'." ...|$|E
6000|$|That {{was the way}} of it, anyhow. I drank deep of {{talk that}} day; we went into theology, into philosophy; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> glimpse of {{socialism}}. I felt as though I had been silent in a silence since I and he had parted. At the thought of socialism Ewart's moods changed for a time {{to a sort of}} energy. [...] "After all, all this confounded vagueness might be altered. If you could get men to work together..." ...|$|E
6000|$|One day, in the afternoon, when it {{was growing}} dusk, and before <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made <b>my</b> <b>first</b> visit to the station, a broad-shouldered jovial-looking fellow in blue coat, belted, and with a sailor's cap, called on me and asked if I should like to [...] "see a 'ouse as 'ad bin blowed up with gas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Mr. Wilson. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done <b>my</b> <b>first</b> {{and last}} bit of gambling. I don't think it is nice, ladies betting, after all, {{and if there were}} a {{hospital}} here I should order you to send the money the gloves will cost you to it as conscience money, and then perhaps you might follow my example with your winnings." ...|$|R
40|$|The art of film—making movies—is often {{portrayed as}} {{something}} glamorous or {{as some sort}} of fun hobby. It can be glamorous, and it often is a fun hobby-turned-career. However, when you break it down, creating a feature film is patience, dedication, people skills, creative problem solving, sleep deprivation, and hard work. This report outlines the experience <b>I</b> <b>had</b> producing <b>my</b> <b>first</b> feature-length film...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{tell you}} I did everything. I was a waitress, {{and a very}} bad one. I broke plates. I muddled orders. Finally I was very rude to a {{customer}} and I went on to try something else. I forget what came next. I {{think it was the}} stage. I travelled for a year with a touring company. That was hard work, too, but I liked it. After that came dressmaking, which was harder and which I hated. And then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> stroke of real luck.' ...|$|E
60|$|Oddly enough it {{was but a}} {{short time}} after seeing the old man at his gate that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> sight of an inmate of Dovecot House. While slowly riding by it I saw a lady come out from the front door--young, good-looking, very pale and dressed in the deepest mourning. She had a bowl in her hand, and going a little {{distance}} from the house she called the pigeons and down they flew in a crowd to her feet to be fed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Looking {{across that}} little table <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> clear sight of Francis Kearny. He {{was about five}} feet seven, but as tough as a cypress knee. His hair was darkest red, his mouth such a mere slit that you {{wondered}} how the flood of his words came rushing from it. His eyes were the brightest and lightest blue and the hopefulest that I ever saw. He gave the double impression {{that he was at}} bay and that you had better not crowd him further.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{there are}} two or three things <b>I</b> <b>have</b> in <b>my</b> mind. <b>First</b> of all, I {{want to be able}} to watch John Simcoe and this Pentonville man when they are talking together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I rely on my simple rights--the {{inalienable}} rights o' my unfettered horsehood. An' I {{am proud}} to say <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never, since <b>my</b> <b>first</b> shoes, lowered myself to obeyin' the will o' man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But at last {{there did}} come a wolf," [...] said Herr Heinrich. [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not sent <b>my</b> <b>first</b> moneys to that Conference upon Esperanto. I feel {{sure it will}} be put off." ...|$|R
60|$|Next day <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> {{sight of}} real mountains. And the Pennsylvania hills, {{that all my}} life had {{appeared}} so high, dwindled to nothing. At Trinidad, where we stopped for breakfast, I walked out on the platform sniffing at the keen thin air. When we crossed the Raton Mountains into New Mexico the sick boy got off at the first station, and I waved good-bye {{to him as the}} train pulled out. Then the mountains and the funny little adobe huts and the Pueblo Indians along the line made me forget everything else.|$|E
6000|$|Why I didn't {{notice it}} before I don't know, {{but it was}} not till Elizabeth showed it to me after dinner that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> look at the Yeardsley [...] "Venus." [...] When she led me up to it, and {{switched}} on the light, it seemed impossible that I could have sat right through dinner without noticing it. But then, at meals, my attention is pretty well riveted on the foodstuffs. Anyway, it was not till Elizabeth showed it to me that I was aware of its existence.|$|E
60|$|It was {{on seeing}} that boy that I understood, {{for the first}} time, my situation. I had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me, not {{at all of the}} home that I was leaving; and now, at sight of this clumsy stranger, who was to stay here in my place beside my mother, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> attack of tears. I am afraid I led that boy a dog's life, for as he was new to the work, I had a hundred {{opportunities}} of setting him right and putting him down, and I was not slow to profit by them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I rely on my simple rights - the {{inalienable}} rights o' my unfettered horsehood. An' I {{am proud}} to say <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never, since <b>my</b> <b>first</b> shoes, lowered myself to obeyin' the will o' man." ...|$|R
60|$|What really decided {{me to go}} to sea {{was that}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> caught <b>my</b> <b>first</b> vision of the death-road which John Barleycorn {{maintains}} for his devotees. It was not a clear vision, however, and there were two phases of it, somewhat jumbled at the time. It struck me, from watching those with whom I associated, that the life we were living was more destructive than that lived by the average man.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is very hard, Helene," [...] he said, [...] "to {{make you}} {{altogether}} understand the situation, {{for there are}} certain phases of it which I cannot discuss with you at all. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> made <b>my</b> <b>first</b> effort to regain Lucille, and it has failed. It is not her fault. I need not {{say that it is}} not mine. But the struggle has commenced, and in the end I shall win." ...|$|R
