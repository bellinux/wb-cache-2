They {{took off and}} <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Danish coast. Out-to-sea he spotted, and was likely seen, by German coastal ships. As they neared land Braham and Walsh noticed a slight whine in the aircraft's radio speakers meaning the Mosquito was being tracked by radar.|$|E
5|$|Overnight, all {{convection}} in Chantal dissipated, and its {{forward speed}} decreased as it <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north. A weak wave caused Chantal {{to speed up}} and the system was absorbed in the frontal system by the night of September 14. Effects on Bermuda were minimal, with the island getting winds of up to 20mph (25km/h) and few thundershowers. Chantal generated swells of 30–40ft (9–12m) offshore.|$|E

5|$|Astana was {{at first}} not invited to the Giro. Six days before the race began, RCS Sport (the {{organizers}} of the Giro) went back on the decision to exclude Astana and extended them a late invitation. This change of heart was at least partly contingent on Contador, Leipheimer, and Klöden participating in the race. Having thought for two months prior {{that they would not}} compete in the Giro, most of Astana's riders had planned to take a break during the Tour of Italy, and Contador was actually vacationing on a beach when Bruyneel called him to tell him the team was <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Giro.|$|E
5|$|Between 1847 and 1870, the {{population}} of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000. The Gold Rush wealth and population increase led to significantly improved transportation between California and the East Coast. The Panama Railway, spanning the Isthmus of Panama, was finished in 1855. Steamships, including those owned by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, began regular service from San Francisco to Panama, where passengers, goods and mail would take the train across the Isthmus and board steamships <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> East Coast. One ill-fated journey, that of the S.S. Central America, ended in disaster as the ship sank in a hurricane {{off the coast of}} the Carolinas in 1857, with approximately three tons of California gold aboard.|$|E
5|$|Following their triumphant Earls Court appearances, Led Zeppelin took {{a holiday}} and planned an autumn tour in America, {{scheduled}} to open with two outdoor dates in San Francisco. In August 1975, however, Plant and his wife Maureen {{were involved in a}} serious car crash while on holiday in Rhodes, Greece. Plant suffered a broken ankle and Maureen was badly injured; a blood transfusion saved her life. Unable to tour, he <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Channel Island of Jersey to spend August and September recuperating, with Bonham and Page in tow. The band then reconvened in Malibu, California. During this forced hiatus much of the material for their next album, Presence, was written.|$|E

Murray's next tournament was the Rotterdam Open after {{receiving}} a late wild card, however he lost to Marin Čilić in straight sets in the quarterfinals. His following competition, the Mexican Open in Acapulco, ended in a semifinal defeat by Grigor Dimitrov in a thrilling three-setter that required two tiebreakers to decide the final two sets.|$|E

Her keel was laid down on 12 June 1934 and she was {{launched}} on 15 October 1935, sponsored by Kathleen H. Mahan (the admiral's great-granddaughter). The ship was commissioned on 18 September 1936, with Commander J. B. Waller in command. The ship departed for Caribbean and South American ports within two months of her commission, combining her initial training and shakedown cruise with a goodwill tour. She remained in the Atlantic until July 1937, then <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Southern California coast for fleet training before steaming to her new station at Pearl Harbor.|$|E

East of Sciota, the highway traversed lightly developed areas, serving several residences separated by patches of woodlands. The route eventually began {{to turn to the}} southeast, connecting with Angelville Road (unsigned CR20) in the process. A long stretch of dense forests followed the turn, with little to no development along the highway.|$|E

The highway turned to the southeast, intersecting with another county route and passing Brighton Town Park. At the intersection with CR60 near the park, NY192 entered Gabriels.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{receiving}} notification, the OAEP {{sent two}} officers to investigate, {{who met the}} doctors and patients at the hospital shortly after noon on 18 February. After questioning the scrapyard owner, they searched for the cylindrical metal pieces initially suspected to be the radiation source, but found {{that they were not}} radioactive. They then <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scrapyard, and noted abnormally high levels of radiation as they approached, late in the evening. At the scrapyard entrance they measured radiation at an equivalent dose of 1 millisievert per hour (mSv/h) and decided to request additional assistance.|$|E

5|$|After sailing for the Clyde {{and back}} to New York in July on its first mercy mission, Blanche F. Sigman moved to its new homeport of Charleston in August 1944. Sailing later that month, the Sigman <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mersey and Liverpool. In October the ship sailed for Gibraltar, Oran, and Leghorn. In December, it {{repeated}} its previous voyage but also stopped at Naples as well, eventually making its way back to Charleston in January 1945. Throughout 1945, the hospital ship made six transatlantic treks, visiting Marseille three times, Naples, Oran, Gibraltar, Milford Haven, Wales, Avonmouth, Cherbourg, and Horta. The Sigmans sixth mission {{of the year was}} a return trip to Cherbourg that ended with a return to its new homeport of New York.|$|E

Mikhail sacrifices himself with a grenade, causing the car to crash into the tower's main courtyard and separating Jill and Carlos briefly. At the Clock Tower, Jill summons the helicopter by ringing the Clock Tower's bell before being confronted by Nemesis, which destroys the helicopter and infects Jill with the T-virus. Jill manages to temporarily defeat Nemesis but falls unconscious due to the T-Virus. Carlos finds Jill and takes her to safety within the Clock Tower. Three days later, he manages to find a cure for Jill's T-Virus infection in the Raccoon City General Hospital. He returns to Jill and injects her with a vaccine, saving her.|$|E
