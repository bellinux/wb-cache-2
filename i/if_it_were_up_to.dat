5000|$|According to a FOIA-sourced {{report by}} Thomas L. Ahern, Jr., from the Center for the Study of Intelligence, Laos, in 1961, was more {{important}} than even the incoming president knew. Kennedy had organized a meeting with Eisenhower, who was on {{his way out of the}} Oval Office, to discuss the strategic importance of Laos. They discussed [...] "keeping the 'cork in the bottle'...to prevent communist dominion over most of the Far East." [...] Eisenhower saw Laos as so important, that he was worried about all of Thailand, Cambodia, and South Vietnam falling to communism if Laos went that way. The president was concerned that the Royal Laotian Army (RLA) was impotent and mutinous, and did not want to rely on them. He was so concerned, that in this meeting, he said he would [...] "as a last desperate hope...intervene unilaterally," [...] <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> him. The interventions, as mentioned in the paragraph above, ended up being the arming and training of paramilitary forces. While preventing a communist Laos remained the objective of the CIA for the next 14 years, the focus of their paramilitary operations changed over time. Until 1964, the Hmong fighters in Laos focused on trying to fight back North Vietnamese fighters and on preventing further encroachment. They were highly important, because the US hadn't begun putting troops on the ground in any great numbers, yet. After that, in 1965, the report describes the Hmong activities in Laos as [...] "flitting over mountain trails or moving by air to occupy key high ground and to harass Hanoi's tanks and artillery," [...] meaning that US troops took on a frontline role and asked the paramilitary forces to operate in more difficult terrain and in less standard ways.|$|E

Conversely, employing users' local knowledge and involving them in decision-making processes could decrease costs and conflicts, in addition to increasing the chances of management success. Here the potential to change conflicting MPAs into conservation areas that take into account fishers' use and knowledge is assessed based on a case study on the Brazilian coast (Paraty town). Fishers (n= 206) from 11 villages were interviewed regarding their main fishing targets and gear, and then only the experienced ones (n= 41) were interviewed from three main fishing villages about the most important commercial species. Fish landings were sampled for one year in these three villages (n= 823), where participatory mapping and group interviews with fishers were also conducted to determine their opinions regarding management and how they thought it should be undertaken. Management measures should not be equivalent across the whole region, as there were clear differences in the target species and gear used. Fishers identified 55 important fishing spots, eight of which were important {{for more than five}} villages, while the experts identified 10 important fishing areas for the target species, which was supported by the sampling of fish landings. The fishers were not opposed to management and no-take reserves but would make some changes in the current design of these measures <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> them. Based on these data, a few changes were indicated in the design of these areas that would likely reduce the conflict between fishers and enforcement agencies. This kind of approach {{could be used as a}} framework for adapting conflictive MPAs or to support the establishment of new ones where fisheries are relevant. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Background: With the {{ratification}} of the Treaty of the European Union, the regions got their roles in the integration process confirmed. Not only did the EU commit itself {{to the principle of}} subsidiarity, and open for potential regional representation in the Council of Ministers, but a Committee of the Regions (COR) was established. This committee is a supranational body consisting of representatives from local and regional authorities. The creation confirmed, for the first time, the recognition of subnational authorities as formal actors in European decision-making. The COR has only a consultative function, but the very institutionalisation has strengthened the role of the regions on the European level. Focus of study: This dissertation studies the national and party political dimensions in the Committee of the Regions. The research objective is two-folded. Firstly, I study how the national and party political dimensions are manifested. Secondly, I explore how the members perceive the roles of these dimensions. These roles is illuminated by three factors: the members representative identity, preference regarding the organisation of the COR and voting behaviour. The members of the Committee of the Regions are nominated {{on the basis of their}} function nationally. Given the different approaches to subnational government of the member states, the representatives are for example mayors of big cities, presidents of regional governments or councillors in communes. With such various backgrounds, it is clear that the members bring with them different experiences and knowledge to the European level. Historical institutionalism is the basis for the expectation of differences in the members view as regards these two dimensions. This theoretical stand states that institutions are important in forming a politician s opinions and behaviour. The hypothesis set forth in this dissertation says that members from centralised member states are, in contrast to members from federalised states, more likely to perceive the national dimension as more important than the party political. To find data in order to examine this hypothesis, a survey was undertaken of members from Germany, Spain, France and the United Kingdom. These member states were chosen to fulfil the following categorisation: federal state, regionalised unitary state, decentralised unitary state and classical unitary state, in order to get a contrast of different approaches to subnational governance. Findings: The national dimension within the Committee of the Regions is manifested in the composition, nomination procedures and organisation. Further, the existence of the regional co-ordinators within the COR shows that the notion of nationality is strong. The party political dimension, being younger than the national, is well reflected in the COR, although less visible. The existence of political groups with their secretariats is an obvious sign of the party political dimension. The fact that political colours of the members play a role in the nomination procedures within the member states and the election of internal posts in the COR is perhaps not so well known. The individual members perceptions of the roles of the national and party political dimensions were examined by answers from questionnaires. To track possible differences in their perceptions, answers from the respondents were categorised according to nationality. The hypothesis claims that members from the least decentralised member states find the national dimension of greater importance than the party political in the Committee of the Regions, and opposite for the representatives from the most decentralised states. The empirical data indicated that no trends for the members perceptions exist after nationality. The members representative identity were illuminated by their basis for representation to the COR and party political affiliation. Regardless of nationality, most members perceive themselves to represent their local/regional territory to the COR. Few of the members believed themselves to be member states representatives. Half of all the respondents think that the party political affiliation contributes much to shaping their representative identity to the committee. The most centralised member state in this survey, the United Kingdom, is represented in the committee with members preferring the political groups both as working structures and as influencing their voting behaviour. Even more French than German representatives prefer the COR to have an organisation method after party political lines. Although national aspects are well represented in the present administration and organisation of the Committee of the Regions, the majority of the members independent of nationality prefer political groups concerning the working structures. Hence, we see a gap between the present organisation and how the members find it the most appropriate. The method of organisation was an IGC-decision, the member states were in charge. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the members, the decision would probably have turned out differently. Similar results showed up concerning influence on voting behaviour. 50 % of the British members claimed party political influence to be the strongest. For the findings as regards the party political identity to the COR, the appropriateness of organisation as well as influence on voting behaviour, the members from the most centralized states had the same score or higher regarding the party political dimension as the representatives from the decentralized states. Empirical data from the survey proved my hypothesis to be weakened. The national dimension is not as important in the members apprehension as expected, regardless of their nationality. Party politics are surprisingly strong in the members perceptions, and that is not only among members from federal states. Although the political groups have become more important over the last couple of years, it is difficult to judge which is more important of political groups or national delegations. It appears that the most important demarcations are those connected to political groups and national delegations. However, the co-existence of these dimensions seems to function fine in practice. It has proved a useful way to approach the tension between uniformity and diversity, probably a solution to respect the differences it is constrained to have due to the heterogenous membership...|$|E

40|$|With the Greens now {{in control}} of the Australian Senate is the Gillard government’s plans for Internet {{censorship}} dead asks Jo Coghlan.   • <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Gillard and Conroy they would introduce Internet filter legislation today. But the reality of the new political paradigm is that the Labor Party’s legislative agenda will now be set by the Greens until the next federal election. The Gillard government is {{not going to want to}} go to the polls early on the back of a double dissolution - because they know that they will lose office and likely be in opposition for at least two terms - so they will ideally only introduce legislation that they know, or think they know, the Greens will back. To do otherwise - and introduce legislation that is going to be defeated would only make Labor seem even more defeated than they currently are. The question is: Is Internet censorship a big-ticket item that Labor either really believes in and must legislate on in this parliament (there is no compelling evidence that Gillard or Conroy really believe in it) or that if Labor do introduce the legislation there is political capital in it - will it help persuade voters in urban cities, mainly the marginal seats in Sydney, Melbourne,and parts of Brisbane, to vote for the Labor Party at the next election. Is Internet censorship legislation an issue that will deliver Labor votes and if it is then what will they give the Green’s to get it through the Senate? Should Gillard and Conroy introduce the much talked about Internet censorship bill, the Greens would have to oppose it in the Senate. If they didn 2 ̆ 7 t it would be like the Meg Lee’s Democrats all over again. The political motivations of the Gillard government to introduce Internet censorship haven’t changed. It remains determined to act as a moral compass for Australian families in order to get some much-needed mum and dad votes from the suburbs. Gillard and Conroy frame this political pragmatism in the mantra that laws are designed to suit the needs of the majority. Similarly the libertarian objections of the Greens to Internet censorship have not changed. Freedom of communication remains a core ideal of the Greens. Should the Gillard government go a little mad (and there is some evidence of a little panic going on in Sydney and Canberra) and introduce its long awaited Internet filter bill, what arguments might sway the Green’s to support the bill? Are current censorship laws enough? Currently, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) is empowered to investigate media issues under the Broadcasting Services Act (1992). It responds to what is seen as offensive and illegal material online by administering a national regulatory scheme that includes the investigation of complaints about prohibited online content. Prohibited content since 2000 (under Section 5 of the 1992 Broadcasting Services Act) refers to “refused classification” material such as child sexual abuse imagery; detailed instruction in crime; non-violent sexually explicit material (X 18 +); and material unsuitable for person under 18 (R 18 +). Since 2008 the Gillard government has proposed to extend regulation of the Internet by ACMA by introducing filters. In December 2009 the government announced it would proceed with plans to censor the Internet after Government-commissioned trials found filtering a blacklist of banned sites was possible. As at 30 April 2009, there were 977 URLs on the ACMA blacklist. Australia already has detailed censorship laws such as the classifications which control what is seen on public television. These classifications could be expanded to other forms of media. The Internet is like a television - it broadcasts images and text that audiences watch or don 2 ̆ 7 t watch. However the problem with Internet censorship is that it is not the ‘Australian internet’ it is global, a point returned to shortly. For now it is reasonable to argue that rather than censorship by filtering certain websites, the government could use the National Classification Code (2005) as it does now to warn viewers. There does however remain a difference between censorship and banning. Under the National Classification Code adults are already refused access to films and videos which: depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that they should not be classified; or depict in a way that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult a minor who is, or who appears to be, under 16 (whether or not engaged in sexual activity); or promote, incite or instruct in matters of crime or violence. Material generally agreed to be potentially harmful to children on films and videos, or in magazines, should be regarded in the same way on the Internet. The Internet 2 ̆ 7 s power and (potential) pervasiveness make it crucial to immediately begin trying to develop an effective and usable system for extending classification to it. But classification is not, and should not be, confused with censorship: censorship in this case being the use of filters to deny adults’ access to the Internet. Is the Internet a free speech issue? Australian law recognises that the maintenance of social cohesion and public order necessitates limits on freedom of speech where it may lead to a breach of the peace and a range of civil and criminal laws are directed at racial hatred. For example, the Anti-Discrimination Act (NSW 1977) and the Racial Hatred Act (Cth 1995) include the offences of racial vilification. International legal instruments also accept that the right to freedom of speech is limited. It is the issue of freedom of communication that is of concern to the Greens and its libertarian position. In terms of violation of freedoms of communication, Australian law hasn’t a strong legal framework. While freedom of communication on matters of government and politics is contained in Sections 7 and 24 of the Constitution, it was not until 1992 that the High Court of Australia formally recognised that the Constitution protected freedom of communication. The decisions in Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Wills and Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth both found that the Constitution contained only an implied freedom of communication. Legal argument in opposition to Internet content regulation is established in freedom of speech and communication jurisprudence. These arguments are more likely to stiffen the Greens’ resolve to deny Gillard and Conroy any pragmatic censorship bill. The Greens however might be swayed to consider extensions of the National Classification Code if it accepts – as most jurisprudence does – that the right to freedom of communication is not absolute. The 2 ̆ 7 right to know 2 ̆ 7, requiring access to knowledge and information and incorporating the idea of freedom of information, is a modern political development. The political ideal of free speech and the idea of freedom to express inquiry and identity, as John Stuart Mill first conceived it, are tied to freedom of thought and opinion. Individuals need to be free to test their ideas of identity, without being held accountable to the state. Increasingly (at least in the West) citizens are taking this idea and using this to defend the right of people to freely access information based on the idea that the more freely information flows, the stronger societies become. Free speech is not an absolute value however and current national laws and international conventions have functioned to regulate adult behavior. In Australia, there are laws dealing with defamation, blasphemy, copyright, obscenity, incitement, use of insulting words, official secrecy, contempt of court and of parliament, sedition and consumer protection that place limits on speech. These laws recognise that there are countervailing interests that must take precedence over freedom of speech in some circumstances. Debates about Internet censorship are problematic: there are moral and value judgments about what is appropriate content, who gets to decide what is normative, and the role of parliament in introducing forms of censorship when freedom of communication is an implied right of the Constitution. The other significant issue that may block any Internet censorship bill in the current parliament is: does it work? How do you censor the Internet? Apart from the political, moral and legal issues of government censorship of the Internet, the technological issues associated with trying to censor the Internet are large, complex and ultimately expensive. The Internet distributes information hence should it be treated as a piece of technology or because it provides interactive text and image, should content be the subject of censorship? Content censorship may work with a book published in Sydney. But the Internet poses considerable challenges for the effective regulation of the reproduction and dissemination of material in digital form, considering that: information distribution can be anonymous; there is an ability to hide information through encryption; and there are jurisdictional difficulties in either enforcing controls or applying punitive measures. There is an inconsistency of cross-border regulation of the Internet even among national partners like European Union states. There are also difficulties in establishing effective co-operation of authorities across national borders, and the labour-intensive cost of attempting the technological difficulties (or impossibilities) of regulating Internet content. To pursue Internet censorship, even if it technologically possible across states who may or may not share national interests will mean it is likely to be a very expensive proposition with little chance of success. Recent accounts of hacking at the IMF, Sony, and the U. S. defense contractor Lockheed Martin show that determined web users will find ways to subvert national efforts. As has been said, there is no such thing as ‘an Australian internet’– the World Wide Web is not a misnomer. Labor’s best legislative attempts to regulate internet content will continue to be frustrated by jurisdictional issues, unlimited costs and well skilled hackers and hacktivists. Never mind, they will also be frustrated by the Greens. In February (2011) Senator Conroy was asked to comment on the Egyptian government cutting Internet access ostensibly to hinder pro-democracy. The Minister assured the journalist that such a thing could never happen in Australia: "…Australia 2 ̆ 7 s a vibrant democracy, where the government doesn 2 ̆ 7 t control the internet [...] . " A year earlier, in February (2010) Conroy had to back peddle after telling ABC radio listeners “you can 2 ̆ 7 t regulate the internet”. While Labor may still aspire to regulating the internet they will be limited by the need to negotiate with the Greens and may therefore need to find new ways of helping the community avoid inappropriate content. Or wait until there is a change to the senate but that won 2 ̆ 7 t be until 2013.

However, I will be brief. The routine is this: It 2 ̆ 7 s sort of like bookends. I will say a few words; Walt will be the book; then I will say a word or two at the end. However, I should point out to you that, coming from Austin, I come from a town that just recently has dedicated an older building to another member of the Rusk family, Thomas Jefferson Rusk, hero of Texas. The building was the Treasury Building, and the dedication came about through one of our senators, Kay Bailey Hutchison. At the dedication, it was pointed out that Rusk, the earlier Rusk, had been not just a hero, but he had participated in the writing of the Texas Declaration of Independence, that he had been at Washington and the Brazos, and that he had chosen the site for the Battle of San Jacinto which, happily {{from the point of view}} of Texas, worked out correctly. However, I will point out to you that the building that you will now see, named after Thomas Jefferson Rusk, the former Treasury Building, represents a fact of Texas that you may not know: We no longer have a state treasury. So, you have a living tradition in international law. What we have is the past of a state treasury, now a part of history. Well, I 2 ̆ 7 m here, not as a part of history, but as a friend of the Rusks, and I will choose only one story to demonstrate it. In the period looking forward to the election of 1964, the Secretary of State realized that the delegations from the many countries then in Washington were comprised of people, very few of whom know much about the mysteries of U. S. government, not to mention the U. S. Constitution. So, he decided it would be important to establish a seminar for diplomats to which would come high officials to explain what they did and, if they chose, why they did it. Senator Javits would come in from the Senate, Ted Sorensen from the White House, Bob Kennedy from the Department of Justice, etc. The reason for this, and listening to Mr. Rusk at that time, I realized how deep his convictions about civil rights were; because he felt that many of the delegations, particularly from newer countries, were delegations then, in the 1960 s, still uncomfortable with some of the conditions that they found in the nation 2 ̆ 7 s capitol. And he felt that by explaining American history, explaining the election, explaining what they would see, they would better understand the upcoming 2 ̆ 764 election. He didn 2 ̆ 7 t then know, nor did I, what Lord Hulme was to say later on when he said, and this from a good British point of view, 2 ̆ 2 Nobody who has witnessed the splendid agony of an American presidential election can doubt the commitment of the United States to democracy. 2 ̆ 2 I feel that this comment is particularly appropriate in 1996. But, running the seminar for diplomats and seeing the continued interest of the Secretary in presenting our country at its best to the world, I was aware that this was a Secretary of uncommon, not only knowledge, uncommon experience, but uncommon human sensitivity. And, I never questioned the fact that this was an excellent selection on the part of President Kennedy for the highest cabinet office. Walt told me, when he saw Kennedy, after he had first met Dean Rusk, that his first impression in seeing the man in West Palm Beach was, he said, 2 ̆ 2 My God, how big he is! 2 ̆ 2 That was not only a physical comment, but it reflects the man, I think, in his fullest sense. He was a big man; and I feel that his stature will grow with time. That 2 ̆ 7 s all I 2 ̆ 7 m going to do for the moment except bring Walt forward as the book between the bookends. WALT W. ROSTOW (former Special Assistant to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and Professor, LBJ Library and Museum) : Mr. President, Dean, and the family of Dean Rusk: I don 2 ̆ 7 t have any story that can match the one with which Elspeth began; but I want to tell you a true story about Dean Rusk and the University of Georgia. He was immensely devoted, not only to the University and the students, but also to the football team. So much so, that he very gently, but firmly, turned down any appointment which would clash with a football game. And, more than that, he was so much attached to the victory of this University 2 ̆ 7 s football team that if it got to a tender moment, a moment of crisis, he would leave his seat. He would walk back to the aisle behind the seats smoking furiously, and wait until the moment of crisis had subsided. It is, as a familiar phrase goes, and as the dean reminded us, a distinct honor to speak on this occasion. I have the privilege of serving as colleague of Dean Rusk from the first Kennedy day to the last day of Lyndon Johnson: eight years. Roughly half that time, I served in the White House at National Security posts, half as Rusk 2 ̆ 7 s policy planner in the Department of State. I got to know him from 1961 on; and my respect and fondness for him only grew in that period of eight years. Dean Rusk was one of the handful of men, in a reasonably long life, I truly admire. When I looked back at those eight years, I came to a somewhat different conclusion than those who have written about the 1960 s. In those books, Dean Rusk is examined as Secretary of State during a critical part of the Cold War. For example, THE NEW YORK TIMES, in the obituary published at his death, devoted most of that to Vietnam. Of course, we faced many problems that rose out of our confrontation with the Soviet Union; and both the President and the Secretary of State took very seriously and personally the war in Southeast Asia and the losses that we faced. But there were crises over the Arabs in Israel, about apartheid in Africa, about the Greeks and Turks in Cyprus, about one or another country in Latin America and the Caribbean, about how to develop poor countries in almost every part of the world. Diplomacy in the 1960 s concerned more than the Soviets; and I find my memories of Dean Rusk were less about the Cold War in Vietnam and more about how an honorable man represented his country in times of great difficulty. When I undertook this paper, I jotted down at random some ten anecdotes about him. Only then did I find they grouped in two parts: one part about a view of the office of the President and the other a view of the office of Secretary of State. As for the President, Rusk had a respect which bordered on reverence for the responsibility the President carried. Several times he said, 2 ̆ 2 We can give the President advice. If it proves to be bad advice, he can fire us and we will disappear from Washington; but he must live with the consequences of his action before this country and the world. 2 ̆ 2 Rusk knew that the President must make decisions with partial information. He must step off in the dark every day. That is the nature of the President 2 ̆ 7 s job, and no one can share it. When students ask me what I learned in Washington, I tell them, 2 ̆ 2 I learned the difference between advice and responsibility. 2 ̆ 2 That is why Rusk sat 2 ̆ 7 Buddha-like 2 ̆ 7, as some of his critics described him, at the Cabinet table. He never debated with President 2 ̆ 7 s aides. He gave his advice directly to the President, who made sure he saw him alone; and he discussed that advice nor the President 2 ̆ 7 s reaction to it. But never, even when we used to meet outside in the afternoons, and weren 2 ̆ 7 t wearing dark suits, and would break out a drink late in the afternoon, and he would, in a sense, confide in me, as near as it was correct to do so; but he never once discussed his advice to the President. This reminds me of my colleague and friend, McGeorge Bundy, who died a few days ago. In Richard Rusk 2 ̆ 7 s excellent book on Dean Rusk, he says at one point that McGeorge Bundy, my successor, regarded us both as allies, not competitors. Now, that didn 2 ̆ 7 t always happen in the half century that we 2 ̆ 7 ve had a National Security Adviser as well as a Secretary of State. And I dare say that Mac Bundy, whose loss I greatly feel, would regard his friendship and being an ally of the Secretary of State, and holding the President and the Secretary of State close together, because they were very different men, as perhaps the finest moment of his career as a public servant. I recall a rare occasion when he let his depth of feelings about the President show. It was an extremely low moment after the Bay of Pigs fiasco. The President left the room briefly to talk with an African head of state; I believe it was Hastings Bond. The conversation around the Cabinet table had wandered. The assembled group around that table needed sleep, had lost perspective, and were filled with a doubt and guilt that often attends disaster. Feeling the desolate mood of his colleagues, Rusk pounded with his left fist the arm of the President 2 ̆ 7 s empty chair and said, 2 ̆ 2 It is this man we must think of. 2 ̆ 2 He ran the State Department on George Marshall 2 ̆ 7 s dictum, 2 ̆ 2 Officers do not have morale problems; only enlisted men do. 2 ̆ 2 He was considerate of his colleagues, extremely civil, and sometimes humorous. But he assumed that they, like him, would bottle up any personal feelings and perform as professionals. His view of his post as Secretary of State was paradoxical. As a number of people have said, he was a modest man. But he never forgot that he belonged to a line that leads directly back to Thomas Jefferson. And he took the responsibility of that office seriously. He said several times, 2 ̆ 2 We face problems we ought to approach on our knees. 2 ̆ 2 And he said this without sounding at all pretentious. If diplomacy failed, the alternative was war in a nuclear age. He hated war as only those who have seen it close up do. You will recall in this taped interview we have had, he referred to war as 2 ̆ 7 the ultimate obscenity 2 ̆ 7; and that was his real view of it. He felt the duty of diplomacy was, to use his own phrase, 2 ̆ 2 to find the 2 ̆ 7 wiggle room 2 ̆ 7 for the diplomat to go to work. 2 ̆ 2 From the first days I knew him in early January 2 ̆ 761, his deepest concern was to get through the Cold War without resort to nuclear weapons fired in anger, as was shown in this tape. It followed directly from this view of his profession that he regarded all foreign ministers as colleagues in a struggle against violence. This was no small thing. He dealt with the representatives of the Third-World countries with great respect, as full members of his 2 ̆ 7 trade union of foreign ministers, 2 ̆ 7 as he called it. I do believe that Kennedy and Johnson were unique among the post-war presidents in taking the developing countries seriously every day, not merely when a crisis forced their attention. In Dean Rusk, they had a Secretary of State who translated their view into day-to-day practice. On a plane to the second Punta del Este meeting early in 1962, Rusk fell into a conversation with me about his boyhood in impoverished Georgia during the inter-war years, then going on to Oxford and the world beyond. It was a vivid account of how much could be accomplished in the life of one man and in one state. I urged him to include some of this in a speech to the Latin American foreign ministers; and he did this to good effect, coming, as it did, from the great Colossus of the North, as we were seen by Latin Americans at that time and now. They did not remember that Franklin Roosevelt, in his inaugural address, described one-third of the nation as ill-fed, ill-clothed, and ill-housed. This was particularly true, at that time, of the South. The special tie between Dean Rusk and Lyndon Johnson partly flowed from their common experience in the American South, an experience which includes, of course, their personal struggles against racial discrimination. There was another side to Rusk. I recall going with him to a conference in Rio de Janeiro. Our hosts arranged that we see a first-rate soccer match between the Dynamo Club of the Soviet Union and the National Team of Brazil. At a certain moment, the Brazilian goal tender prevented a goal and was awarded a free kick. The Dynamo players moved back, leaving only a small line lying some yards in front of the Brazilian goal tender. He kicked, but it was low. It struck the knee of one of the Dynamo defenders and went back swiftly into the Brazilian goal. As the crowd erupted in anguish, Dean Rusk leaned over and said, 2 ̆ 2 Now he knows how the Secretary of State feels every day. 2 ̆ 2 In the same mood, he once said this, 2 ̆ 2 My last thought as I go to bed at night is that it is daylight in half the world and that people are making trouble which will arrive on my desk in tomorrow morning 2 ̆ 7 s cables. 2 ̆ 2 There is another moment I treasure, which is also in Richard 2 ̆ 7 s book: Dean Rusk was notably terse on the telephone. He said what he wanted to say and hung up. One day I was working in my office, and there was a continuous ring on the phone, which indicated the President was on the line. He said, in an amused, not an angry way, 2 ̆ 2 He 2 ̆ 7 s done it again! Rusk hung up on me before I was finished. 2 ̆ 2 Dean Rusk had many distinguished moments, but I suspect he was the only man to hang up on a President in full flight. Perhaps my most serious thought about Dean Rusk as Secretary of State, I want to set down this way: The post of Secretary of State in the 1960 s was certainly the most exacting post in the government. It was loaded with inescapable overhead commitments, protracted ordeals before congressional committees, overseas trips to international conferences, an endless flow of meetings with ambassadors, White House and Diplomatic dinners, State visits with the need for fined-grained exchanges with foreign ministers, an intense series of bilateral exchanges at the annual gathering of foreign ministers at the U. N. General Assembly gathering in September. All this, plus the need to administer a large department; to be fully informed on the state of a fissionable world; to be responsible for the daily flow of cables to every corner of the globe, of which a half dozen or so carry heavy freight and require that every word be weighed; and then, above all, the need to be prepared to render advice to the President at any hour of the day or night. I simply don 2 ̆ 7 t know how Dean Rusk carried his responsibilities for eight difficult years; but he did so with grace, with eloquence, and with character. Whether applying to hostile members of a congressional hearing on The Hill or dealing with unbroken courtesy with a representative of the Soviet Union, or a NATO ally, or a neutralist state in Africa, America was never better represented to the world than by Dean Rusk. And, the University of Georgia is wise and does itself proud to name in his honor the hall dedicated to international and comparative law. ELSPETH D. ROSTOW I 2 ̆ 7 m not sure that President Kennedy did not know Dean Rusk before he met him. I once argued with Professor Rusk that the article that Rusk wrote in Foreign Affairs in April of 1960, which was certainly read by President-elect Kennedy [...] It was an article on the President, and it came out at a time when many people were giving advice to the incoming President. Rusk participated also, in an American assembly meeting which set out the qualifications for the Secretary of State. If you look through this now ancient volume, you will see that the structure of the office of the Secretary of State described here was carried through, as Walt has indicated, in an admirable fashion by the man he chose. And it 2 ̆ 7 s interesting that, I 2 ̆ 7 d looked over the list of the men, and, of course, in 1960 those thinking about high policy [...] Well, no, I won 2 ̆ 7 t finish that sentence. But in any case, they were all men. Included, I would say, I counted something like fifteen people who thought themselves highly qualified to become Secretary of State and who gave their names to this volume, perhaps in the hope that lightning would strike in their direction. Although Dean Rusk was there, we have good evidence that he did not so imagine himself, but that was where Kennedy elected to have the lightning strike. I think it appropriate, at the end, to let Rusk, again, have the words. And from this article on the President, I will quote part of the opening paragraph: The United States, in this second half of the twentieth century, is not a raft tossed by the winds and waves of historical forces over which it has little control. Its dynamic power, physical and ideological, generates historical forces. What it does or does not do makes a great deal of difference to the history of man in this epoch. If realism requires us to avoid illusions of omnipotence, it is just as important that we not underestimate the opportunity and the responsibility which flow from our capacity to act and to influence and shape the course of events. Involved is not merely a benign concern for the well being of others, but the shape of the world in which we ourselves must live. The range within which the nation can make deliberate choices is wide. If we do not make them deliberately, we shall make them by negligence or yield the decision to others who will not be mindful of our interests. When the emphasis of discussion falls too heavily, for my taste, on the limitations of policy, I recall from early childhood the admonition of the circuit preacher, 2 ̆ 2 Pray as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> God, work as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> you. 2 ̆ 2 I suspect that Kennedy, looking at that, thought that the man who so spoke would make his best choice as Secretary of State, and Kennedy was correct. Thank you. DEAN EDWARD D. SPURGEON Thank you so much for coming and for sharing your thoughts and your knowledge about the man and his contributions. I want to ask Peter White if he would come up: Peter, who heads the Southern Center for International Studies, and who, along with Julia White, has played a major role in helping us plan today 2 ̆ 7 s events and in inviting the Rostows to join us. Peter. PETER WHITE Thank you, Ned. In 1985, Ann Dunn and Rich Rusk and Julia entered into a great conspiracy which was designed to get Mr. Rusk before a camera. At that time, his eyesight began to fail, and we were concerned about that; and so we got together [...] Julia did [...] here on this campus, sat Mr. Rusk down after a great deal of research, and for three days, as you saw on the video tape, we were fortunate enough to capture his reminiscences. We did this without any money. Took several years. But in the end we were able to pull together the funding; and these three days of taping resulted in a thirteen-part television series. Some of these tapes have been seen on [...] I know you 2 ̆ 7 re not supposed to do this to the gift, but I want to make the point here by tearing off the wrapping. We ended up developing some, Julia did, editing, thirteen thirty-minute television programs. We 2 ̆ 7 ve gone through this process before. We presented these thirteen tapes, which are available through the Southern Center, to the University some years ago, but they ended up in the University library and no one has access to them there. So, we thought on this occasion it would be appropriate to give this series to the Law School, present it to the Dean, so that the students of the institution might have it. If you enjoyed these words on this tape, these tapes are quite extraordinary. It 2 ̆ 7 s the best of Mr. Rusk, and we were deeply honored to have that opportunity. So I hope the students of the Law School will enjoy these tapes. DEAN EDWARD D. SPURGEON The students and the faculty and our visitors will very much enjoy them. Thank you. I might remind you that tomorrow at two o 2 ̆ 7 clock on the North Campus, because we know the weather is going to be fine, we will dedicate the building. All of you are invited. Governor Miller will be here to help us honor and dedicate the building. That concludes our program. I want to invite any of you who are not able to join us tomorrow and who would like to have a tour of Dean Rusk Hall to meet outside the north entrance, which is the entrance closest to the Law School, at about 3 : 30; and we would be happy to give you a tour of the building. It will take 30 to 40 minutes, or however much time that you can devote to it before you have to leave. Thank you very much for coming; and we hope to see you tomorrow...|$|E
