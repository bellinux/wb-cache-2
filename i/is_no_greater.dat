500|$|Scot Guenter (American Studies) {{considered}} the biography [...] "particularly timely" [...] for the post-September 11 relevance of Meiklejohn's democratic {{experiments in the}} face of the privatization of higher education, and of Meiklejohn's courage towards free speech. He wrote that Meiklejohn's views on curriculum would arouse [...] "needed" [...] reflection in college instructors, and that the book's audience should include university administration and those interested in civil liberties as well as historians and philosophers of education. Guenter appreciated how Nelson presented the shortcomings of Meiklejohn's ego and spendthrift lifestyle. Robert Sherman, writing for the History of Education Quarterly and reflecting on the depth of the appendices, struggled to consider [...] "how such a work could be more complete". He wrote through Louis Menand that Meiklejohn's [...] "certitude [...] to violence" [...] and that by letting him speak for himself, Nelson made the French philosopher Charles Renouvier's point that only individuals are certain and that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>greater</b> certainty. Guenter added that the biography read best in the parts where Nelson was clearly inspired by Meiklejohn's zeal and idealism, particularly the [...] "What Does the First Amendment Mean?"

500|$|A common {{objection}} to evolution {{is that it}} is simply too unlikely for life, in its complexity and apparent [...] "design," [...] to have arisen [...] "by chance." [...] It is argued that the odds of life having arisen without a deliberate intelligence guiding it are so astronomically low that it is unreasonable not to infer an intelligent designer from the natural world, and specifically from the diversity of life. A more extreme version of this argument is that evolution cannot create complex structures (see the Creation of complex structures section below). The idea that it is simply too implausible for life to have evolved is often wrongly encapsulated with a quotation that the [...] "probability of life originating on Earth <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>greater</b> than the chance that a hurricane, sweeping through a scrapyard, would have the luck to assemble a Boeing 747"—a claim attributed to astrophysicist Fred Hoyle and known as Hoyle's fallacy. Hoyle was a Darwinist, atheist and anti-theist, but advocated the theory of panspermia, in which abiogenesis begins in outer space and primitive life on Earth is held to have arrived via natural dispersion.|$|E

According to Dorothy Hill, blues editor for Jazz Now, listeners can hear James [...] "murmuring admiration" [...] for Walton's piano work {{in the background of}} [...] "He's Funny That Way".

Sklair arranged the latter song and performed on guitar; also featured is Rick Baptist on flugelhorn. [...] "These Foolish Things", originally written by Harry Link, Holt Marvell and Jack Strachey, previously appeared on James' 1995 album of the same name. Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer's [...] "Come Rain or Come Shine" [...] is followed by [...] "Don't Worry 'bout Me" [...] (Rube Bloom, Ted Koehler). Leading up to the album's close are Arthur Hamilton's [...] "Cry Me a River", [...] "Don't Blame Me" [...] (Dorothy Fields, Jimmy McHugh), and [...] "My Man" [...] which features a trombone solo by George Bohannon. The album's closing and title track features vocals by James' mother, Dorothy Hawkins.|$|E
