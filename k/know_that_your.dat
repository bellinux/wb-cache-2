500|$|On 17 February 1895 Nansen began a {{farewell}} {{letter to his}} wife, Eva, writing that should he come to grief [...] "you will <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> image {{will be the last}} I see." [...] He was also reading everything he could about Franz Josef Land, his intended destination after the pole. The archipelago had been discovered in 1873 by Julius Payer, and was incompletely mapped. It was, however, apparently the home of countless bears and seals, and Nansen saw it as an excellent food source on his return journey to civilization.|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, given Truman's sinking {{popularity}} and the Democratic Party's three-way split (between Truman, Henry A. Wallace, and Strom Thurmond), Dewey had seemed unstoppable. Republicans figured that {{all they had}} to do to win was to avoid making any major mistakes, and as such Dewey did not take any risks. He spoke in platitudes, trying to transcend politics. Speech after speech was filled with empty statements of the obvious, such as the famous quote: [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> future is still ahead of you." [...] An editorial in the Louisville Courier-Journal summed it up: ...|$|E
2500|$|Stonewall Jackson died on May 10 and Stuart {{was once}} again devastated {{by the loss of}} a close friend, telling his staff that the death was a [...] "national calamity." [...] Jackson's wife, Mary Anna, wrote to Stuart on August 1, thanking him for a note of sympathy: [...] "I need not assure you of which you already <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> {{friendship}} & admiration were cordially reciprocated by him. I have frequently heard him speak of Gen'l Stuart as one of his warm personal friends, & also express admiration for your Soldierly qualities." ...|$|E

2500|$|On December 19, Duty offered Wise some {{cigarettes}} {{in exchange for}} allowing himself to be tied up to make the guards think {{that he had been}} taken hostage, with the goal of having Duty transferred into administrative security. The prosecutor's report stated that after tying Wise's hands and feet behind his back, Duty strangled him to death with a shoelace. Duty then wrote a letter to Wise's mother Mary, in which he stated: [...] "Well {{by the time you get}} this letter you will already <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> son is dead. I know now because I just killed him an hour ago. Gee you'd think I'd be feeling some remorse but I'm not." [...] The letter was intercepted at the prison.|$|E
2500|$|Larry Laudan has {{suggested}} pseudoscience has no scientific meaning and is mostly {{used to describe}} our emotions: [...] "If we would {{stand up and be}} counted on the side of reason, we ought to drop terms like 'pseudo-science' and 'unscientific' from our vocabulary; they are just hollow phrases which do only emotive work for us". Likewise, Richard McNally states, [...] "The term 'pseudoscience' has become little more than an inflammatory buzzword for quickly dismissing one's opponents in media sound-bites" [...] and [...] "When therapeutic entrepreneurs make claims on behalf of their interventions, we should not waste our time trying to determine whether their interventions qualify as pseudoscientific. Rather, we should ask them: How do you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> intervention works? What is your evidence?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Anglican {{establishment}} predominantly opposed Darwin. Palmerston, {{who became}} Prime Minister in June 1859, mooted Darwin's name to Queen Victoria {{as a candidate}} for the Honours List with the prospect of a knighthood. While Prince Albert supported the idea, after the publication of the Origin Queen Victoria's ecclesiastical advisers, including the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce, dissented and the request was denied. Some Anglicans were more in favour, and Huxley reported of Kingsley that [...] "He is an excellent Darwinian to begin with, and told me a capital story of his reply to Lady Aylesbury who expressed astonishment at his favouring such a heresy â€“ 'What can be more delightful to me Lady Aylesbury, than to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> Ladyship & myself sprang from the same toad stool.' Whereby the frivolous old woman shut up, in doubt whether she was being chaffed or adored for her remark." ...|$|E
