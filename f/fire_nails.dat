50|$|One {{of their}} more recent tricks {{involves}} a powered nail gun with a quantity of missing nails from the series of nails in its magazine. Penn begins by firing several apparently real nails into a board in front of him. He then proceeds to <b>fire</b> the <b>nail</b> gun into {{the palm of his}} hand several times, while suffering no injuries. His pattern builds as he oscillates between firing blanks into his hand and <b>firing</b> <b>nails</b> into the board, and fires one blank into Teller's crotch. Near the end of the trick, he says that it is a trick and that he and Teller believe that it is morally wrong to do things on stage that are really dangerous—it makes the audience complicit in unnecessary human risk.|$|R
40|$|Low-energy {{penetrating}} nail {{injury to}} the brain is an extremely rare neurosurgical emergency. The {{most common cause of}} nail gun injury is work related accidents; other causes result from accidental <b>firing</b> of a <b>nail</b> gun, suicide attempts by <b>firing</b> <b>nail</b> guns into the brain, and bomb blasts containing pieces of nails. Neurosurgical treatment performed by craniotomy still seems to be the safest one; there are reports of complications such as subdural hematoma and intraparenchymal hemorrhages following the blind removal of foreign bodies leading to suggestions that all penetrating foreign bodies should be removed under direct vision. We report a rarely described neurosurgical approach for removal of a penetrating nail from the brain and skull without evidence of associated hematoma and other brain lesions...|$|R

25|$|Altogether thirty-six sailors of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines {{were killed}} in action, another ninety-three were wounded. The main action lasted over a half hour and only two Americans were killed and seven wounded in total, {{including}} Reid who {{was hit with a}} musket ball. Reid's men <b>fired</b> <b>nails,</b> knife blades, brass buttons and other makeshift projectiles from their cannon which reportedly caused severe pain to the surviving British. After being repulsed the British slowly rowed back to their ships and it was 2:00 am on September 27 when they found them. Captain Loyd's response to the defeat was to send the Carnation back to destroy the General Armstrong after daylight but when she arrived, American fire caused further damage so Carnation broke off the attack. A little later the Carnation appeared again but Captain Reid had already chosen to scuttle his brig by firing one of his swivel guns straight through the hull. The vessel was boarded while it was sinking and the British set the sails on fire.|$|R

25|$|On 27 November 1969, PAVN Group 968 {{attacked}} Thatheng. The Royalist defenders {{held out}} until 13 December {{when it was}} attacked by three PAVN infantry battalions. The town fell to the PAVN, but the Royalist Bataillon Volontaires 46 (Volunteer Battalion 46) hung on in an adjacent stronghold despite casualties of about 40 killed, 100 wounded, and 30 missing. While the Royalists sheltered within the French-built fort, the communists blasted away land mines and defensive barbed wire to clear paths for frontal assaults by their infantry. By day, Raven Forward Air Controllers directed close air support against the PAVN. An AC-130 Spectre gunship was sent to their relief, in its first-ever appearance supporting Lao troops in contact. For the next four nights, the gunship would strafe the town with a copious volume of minigun and 20mm cannon <b>fire.</b> <b>Nail</b> FACs from Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base flew night reconnaissance. Royal Lao Air Force AT-28s blasted most of the town flat, sparing only the pagoda. Group 968 suffered an estimated 240 killed by air strikes. Total PAVN losses to air attacks were estimated at 500. At this juncture, the besieged BV 46 had become wholly dependent on air power to defend their fixed position.|$|R

50|$|There is recoil {{associated}} with the discharge of a nail from a nail gun. Contact triggers allow the gun to <b>fire</b> unintended <b>nails</b> if the nose hits the wood surface or a previously placed nail following recoil. Nailers with touch tip (contact) triggers are susceptible to this double firing. According to a 2002 engineering report from the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC), the recoil and firing of the second nail occurs well before the trigger can be released. Acute injury rates are twice as high among users of tools with contact triggers.|$|R

40|$|BackgroundPneumatic nail guns used in wood framing are {{equipped}} with one of two triggering mechanisms. Sequential actuation triggers {{have been shown to}} be a safer alternative to contact actuation triggers because they reduce traumatic injury risk. However, the sequential actuation trigger must be depressed for each individual <b>nail</b> <b>fired</b> as opposed to the contact actuation trigger, which allows the trigger to be held depressed as <b>nails</b> are <b>fired</b> repeatedly by bumping the safety tip against the workpiece. As such, concerns have been raised about risks for cumulative trauma injury, and reduced productivity, due to repetitive finger motion with the sequential actuation trigger. PurposeThis study developed a method to predict cumulative finger flexor tendon travel associated with the sequential actuation trigger nail gun from finger joint kinematics measured in the trigger actuation and productivity standards for wood-frame construction tasks. MethodsFinger motions were measured from six users wearing an instrumented electrogoniometer glove in a simulation of two common framing tasks 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cwall building and flat nailing of material. Flexor tendon travel was calculated from the ensemble average kinematics for an individual <b>nail</b> <b>fired.</b> ResultsFinger flexor tendon travel was attributable mostly to proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal joint motion. Tendon travel per <b>nail</b> <b>fired</b> appeared to be slightly greater for a wall-building task than a flat nailing task. The present study data, in combination with construction industry productivity standards, suggest that a high-production workday would be associated with less than 60 m/day cumulative tendon travel per worker (based on 1700 trigger presses/day). Conclusion and ApplicationsThese results suggest that exposure to finger tendon travel from sequential actuation trigger nail gun use may be below levels that have been previously associated with high musculoskeletal disorder risk.

40|$|A biomechanical {{model is}} presented, and {{combined}} with measurements of tip press force, to estimate total user hand force associated with two pneumatic nail gun trigger systems. The contact actuation trigger (CAT) can <b>fire</b> a <b>nail</b> when the user holds the trigger depressed {{first and then}} "bumps" the nail gun tip against the workpiece. With a full sequential actuation trigger (SAT) the user must press the tip against the workpiece prior to activating the trigger. The SAT is demonstrably safer in reducing traumatic injury risk, but increases the duration (and magnitude) of tip force exertion. Time integrated (cumulative) hand force was calculated for a single user from measurements of the tip contact force with the workpiece and transfer time between nails as inputs to a static model of the nail gun and workpiece in two nailing task orientations. The model shows the hand force dependence upon {{the orientation of the}} workpiece in addition to the trigger system. Based on standard time allowances from work measurement systems (i. e. Methods-Time Measurement - 1) it is proposed that efficient application of hand force with the SAT in maintaining tip contact can reduce force exertion attributable to the sequential actuation trigger to 2 - 8 % (horizontal nailing) and 9 - 20 % (vertical nailing) of the total hand/arm force. The present model is useful for considering differences in cumulative hand/arm force exposure between the SAT and CAT systems and may explain the appeal of the CAT trigger in reducing the user's perception of muscular effort.
