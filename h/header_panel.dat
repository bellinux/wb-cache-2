2500|$|The 1974 {{model year}} brought {{the only major}} body design changes, due to revised front and rear [...] bumper standards-A slanted <b>header</b> <b>panel</b> with a new split grill and {{recessed}} headlamp bezels complement the larger, front 5mph aluminum bumper. Front and rear license plate brackets were relocated and a larger rear 5mph aluminum bumper was used increasing the overall length three inches compared to the 1973 models.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1975 and 1977, a Buick Special coupe was {{marketed as}} part of the Century model lineup as an entry level vehicle. Called the [...] "Century Special" [...] in Buick literature, the coupe was based on the 2-door {{fastback}} body style but had a special landau roof that covered most of the quarter glass, giving it the appearance of the higher-level formal roof cars. 1976 and 1977 models had a unique body-color <b>header</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1987 was {{the final}} year for the rear-wheel drive sedan, and both coupe models {{received}} a restyled <b>header</b> <b>panel</b> with composite headlights. A Buick 231 was the base motor alongside the Oldsmobile 307. For its final year, the 442 package {{was moved to the}} Supreme model.|$|E
50|$|Starting {{with the}} 1977 model year, the Diplomat became a full model line, {{rather than as}} {{the name of a}} {{particular}} body style. It was introduced as a late 1977 model in spring 1977 as a longer, fancier upmarket version of the F-body Aspen. The chassis and mechanical components are identical, and doors and various other body panels are interchangeable except for the front and rear <b>header</b> <b>panels,</b> bumpers, hood and trunk lid. Larger taillights extended into the rear hatch of the station wagon.|$|R
5000|$|Cutlass Supreme and Calais coupes {{received}} new <b>header</b> <b>panels</b> incorporating four headlights, {{mimicking the}} 1977 model. The four-door Salon was dropped due to poor sales. Taking its {{place was a}} conventional notchback sedan known simply as [...] "Cutlass," [...] with base, LS, and Brougham trim levels available. Sister division Buick {{did the same with}} their Buick Century sedan (the 1978 to 1980 Centuries shared the bodyshell with the Cutlass Salon). The 4-4-2 package was moved to the Cutlass Calais, and while it lacked the Dual Gate shifter, it was essentially a carryover of the 1979 Hurst/Olds, even having the Oldsmobile 350 V8 886 80 442's were produced for 1980. The 260 diesel engine was dropped, as it was considerably slower yet no more economic than the 5.7-litre diesel.|$|R
5000|$|Intel {{warns that}} HDA dongles {{should be used}} with HDA motherboards: It is {{strongly}} recommended that motherboard designers only use Intel HD Audio analog front panel dongles with the Intel HD Audio analog front <b>panel</b> <b>header</b> {{to insure that the}} jack detection and dynamic re-tasking capability is preserved. Passive AC’97 analog front panel dongles (ones which leave the 5V Analog pin-7 line unconnected on the dongle) may be used with the Intel HD Audio analog front <b>panel</b> <b>header.</b> But note that the front panel jack detection and re-tasking functionality will be lost as the AC’97 jacks cannot support connection to the SENSE line. In addition, software must be aware that an AC’97 dongle is being used with an Intel HD Audio analog header since the software might need to dedicate codec ports that are connected to the header to meet the product’s intended functionality.|$|R
50|$|The 1973 {{model year}} Darts {{received}} new front styling with revised fenders, grille, <b>header</b> <b>panel,</b> and hood. Massive front bumpers were installed {{to comply with}} new federal regulations, as well as side-impact guard beams in the doors and new emission control devices. New single-piston disc brakes replaced the more complex 4-piston units offered from 1965 to 1972.|$|E
50|$|For 1974, {{the rear}} bumper of Impalas and other {{full-sized}} Chevrolets incorporated shock absorbing cylinders {{to meet the}} upgraded bumper standards with new taillights above the bumper, separated by the license plate and fuel filler. The front end featured a new grille and headlight bezels, a new <b>header</b> <b>panel,</b> and a bumper with a drop down center section. The marker lights moved back up beside the headlamps.|$|E
5000|$|... "With {{oil crisis}} {{memories}} starting to fade" [...] Ford needed a V8 in the Mustang II to return [...] "performance to respectable levels." [...] The engine bay was re-engineered {{to accept the}} 302 CID L V8 option for the 1975 model year, with revised hood and <b>header</b> <b>panel.</b> The engine was limited to a two-barrel carburetor and [...] "net" [...] Since Ford's Mexican division never lost the V8, they assisted in the modifications.|$|E
5000|$|The {{removable}} roof {{consists of two}} carbon fiber panels, weighing 6 kg each, which required the reinforcement of the rear pillar {{to compensate for the}} loss of structural integrity as well as to accommodate the rollover protection and ventilation systems for the engine. The panels are easily removable and are stored in the front luggage compartment. The Aventador Roadster has a unique engine cover design and an attachable wind deflector to improve cabin airflow at high speed as well as a gloss black finish in the A-pillars, windshield <b>header,</b> roof <b>panels,</b> and rear window area. The car has a [...] base price. With a total weight of 1625 kg it's only 50 kg heavier than the coupé (the weight of the roof, plus additional stiffening in the sills and A-pillars).|$|R
5000|$|Between 1975 and 1977, a Buick Special coupe was {{marketed as}} part of the Century model lineup as an entry level vehicle. Called the [...] "Century Special" [...] in Buick literature, the coupe was based on the 2-door {{fastback}} body style but had a special landau roof that covered most of the quarter glass, giving it the appearance of the higher-level formal roof cars. 1976 and 1977 models had a unique body-color <b>header</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 1974 {{model year}} brought {{the only major}} body design changes, due to revised front and rear 5 mi/h km/h bumper standards-A slanted <b>header</b> <b>panel</b> with a new split grill and {{recessed}} headlamp bezels complement the larger, front 5 mph aluminum bumper. Front and rear license plate brackets were relocated and a larger rear 5 mph aluminum bumper was used increasing the overall length three inches compared to the 1973 models.A revised rear panel on notchback and hatchback models had new Firebird-styled taillights and ventilation extractor grills were eliminated on trunk and hatch lids.|$|E
50|$|Also {{shared with}} the {{corporate}} X platform {{was part of the}} roof stamping and trunk floor pan (for 1973 and newer X platform vehicles). Cadillac stylists added a crisp, angular body that set the tone for GM styling for the next decade, along with a wide-track stance giving car a substantial, premium appearance. A wide chrome grille flanked by quadruple rectangular headlamps with narrow parking and signal lamps just below filled the <b>header</b> <b>panel,</b> while small wrap-around rectangular tail lamps placed at the outermost corners of the rear gave the appearance of a lower, leaner, and wider car. The wrap-around taillights might have come from a design sketch of a rejected Coupe DeVille concept.|$|E
50|$|The 1975 Impala used a 1974 carried-over Caprice front end, with a grille insert and emblem change. The Caprice model {{carried a}} new front {{end with a}} swept back style <b>header</b> <b>panel</b> with {{recessed}} headlight buckets, a new hood, and new fenders. Also in 1975 upholstery, door panels and the dashboard were revised as were the radio and climate control graphics. Speedometers read up to 100 mph, and added kilometers per hour. 1975 officially debuted a high-energy (HEI) electronic ignition system. Catalytic converters were also introduced as were several new options, including an Econominder gauge package, intermittent wipers, and a divided 50-50 bench seat (with a choice of sport cloth or vinyl trim).|$|E
50|$|After 13 {{years of}} production, 1997 saw the Cherokee receive updated {{exterior}} and interior styling. Both the two- and four-door bodies remained in production, receiving a steel liftgate (replacing the fiberglass one used previously), restyled taillights, additional plastic molding along the doors, {{as well as a}} new front <b>header</b> <b>panel</b> that featured more aerodynamic styling. The spare tire was moved from a rear exterior bumper mount to an interior location due to de-contenting the rear bumper. A new, unique spare tire carrier was invented by Peter Gruich while working for Jeep Special Programs that utilized the trailer hitch bar and a unique pivot bracket and although it was the only external spare tire carrier to pass the full Jeep durability test, it was not offered for sale.|$|E
50|$|While the {{standard}} S-10 {{moved to a}} redesigned front fascia in 1998, the S-10 Electric kept the same front fascia as the '94-'97, {{with the exception of}} composite headlamps in 1998 versus the previous year's sealed-beam headlamps. The interior was also updated in 1998 along with internal combustion models, adding a passenger side airbag. Aside from this <b>header</b> <b>panel,</b> a unique lower bumper valance, and a stylized 'Electric' decal {{on the bottom of the}} doors, there is little difference externally between the appearance of an Electric and a stock S-10. Any changes, however minimal, were reported to have had a positive influence on reducing the truck's aerodynamic resistance. These changes included a closed grille and a front air skirt, belly pans beneath the front suspension, a seal between the cab and the pickup bed, and a half-length tonneau cover over the rear of the pickup bed.|$|E
5000|$|The Rand Building is a {{historic}} commercial building in Huntsville, Alabama. Built in 1883, it and the adjacent building, the Donegan Block, represent a simplified Italianate architecture style common in smaller towns in the late 19th century. It is one of few remaining Italianate buildings which once were prevalent on Courthouse Square. The two-story green-painted brick building has an elaborate bracketed metal cornice with decorative panels between the brackets. The street-level façade has large four-pane fixed windows supported by paneled bulkheads, with a central recessed entry. A second row of smaller windows runs above the first, below a smoothed concrete <b>header</b> <b>panel</b> which along which an awning runs {{the width of the}} building. On the second floor, three two-over-two sash windows with segmental arched tops are in a frame recessed one course {{from the rest of the}} building. [...] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, {{the rear}} bumper was {{redesigned}} with shock absorbers {{to meet the}} upgraded standards and new tail lights were featured. The front end was also freshened as in previous years, with a new grille and headlight bezels, a new <b>header</b> <b>panel,</b> and a bumper with a drop down center section. The marker lights moved back up beside the headlamps once again. This was the only year of the 1971-1976 models the Impala had a different front end design than the Caprice Classic, as other years used either a grille insert or previous year Caprice front to distinguish the two. The rooflines of the Impala coupes were also revised. For 1974 the Custom Coupe {{was no longer a}} hardtop, with large fixed rear quarter glass and a thick B-pillar. The Sport Coupe, still a pillar-less hardtop, now used larger roll-down quarter glass like that of the 1971-1973 Custom Coupe, and had a narrower, fastback style, flat back window. Sedans used carryover body shells from previous years.|$|E
5000|$|In 1981, the Cutlass Supreme coupe {{received}} an aerodynamic restyle (with a [...] "shovel-nose" [...] front <b>header</b> <b>panel),</b> which, {{along with a}} higher rear deck, decreased air resistance by 15%. It would continue with this basic design until the final rear-drive Cutlass was produced in 1988. A 4-door sedan {{was added to the}} Supreme lineup, with a new front end and a slight taillight lens restyle (resembling a touch-tone dial or Rubik's Cube - this lens style was used until 1984). It was this restyled body that (along with the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Buick Regal, and Pontiac Grand Prix) ushered in the down-sized cars into NASCAR cup competition. While the Cutlass looked almost identical to the Buick Regal (which scored 35+ victories in the 1981 thru 1985 seasons), the Cutlass (like the Dodge Mirada) didn't take one checkered flag, and many teams moved away from it in 1983 to the Regal, Grand Prix, and restyled Monte Carlo SS. This was a rude awakening to Oldsmobile, which was getting used to wins on the NASCAR circuit.|$|E
5000|$|For 1976, models had 300 changes. A {{facelift}} included revised <b>header</b> <b>panel</b> with Chevy bowtie emblem, wider grill, revised headlamp bezels - all in corrosion-resistant material - and new tri-color taillights for the notchback and hatchback (although {{the amber}} turn signals were nonfunctional). Cooling and durability of the Dura-Built 2.3-liter engine were improved. The chassis received the Monza's upgraded components including box-section front cross-member, larger {{front and rear}} brakes (with the fronts gaining vented rotors), and torque-arm rear suspension. Extensive anti-rust improvements to the body included galvanized fenders and rocker panels. New models were introduced: GT estate wagon, Cabriolet notchback (with a half-vinyl roof and opera windows similar to the Monza Towne coupe) and limited-edition Nomad wagon with restyled side windows. New options included BorgWarner five-speed manual overdrive transmission and houndstooth seat trim named [...] "sport cloth" [...] at an additional $18. A [...] "Sky-Roof" [...] with tinted reflecting sliding glass and an eight-track tape player were options from January. The Cosworth was canceled in July after 1,446 1976 models.|$|E
5000|$|The 1975 Impala used a 1974 carried-over Caprice front end, with a grille insert and emblem change. The Caprice {{model was}} revised {{with a new}} front end with a swept back style <b>header</b> <b>panel</b> with {{recessed}} headlight buckets, a new hood, and new fenders. Also in 1975 upholstery, door panels and the dashboard were revised as were the radio and climate control graphics. Speedometers read up to 100 mph, and added kilometers per hour. A High Energy Ignition (HEI) system was officially introduced in 1975, although it was installed on some 1974 cars as a clandestine option. Catalytic converters were also introduced, as were several new options, including an Econominder gauge package (which also included a coolant temperature gauge), intermittent wipers, and a divided 50/50 bench seat with passenger-side recliner (with a choice of sport cloth or vinyl trim). This was {{the final year of}} the full-size Chevrolet convertible. Four-door models got new rooflines; the hardtop Sport Sedan got a small triangular [...] "opera window" [...] carved out of the wide roof panel.|$|E
5000|$|For 1974, {{the major}} {{exterior}} changes were a revised front end and 5 mph rear bumper, increasing overall length 6 in, and a slanted front <b>header</b> <b>panel</b> with recessed headlamp bezels. Louvered steel replaced the egg-crate plastic grille. Front and rear aluminum bumpers with inner steel spring replaced the chrome items, with license plate mountings relocated. A revised rear panel on notchback and hatchback models had larger single-unit taillights, with ventilation grills eliminated from trunk and hatch lids. A [...] fuel tank replaced the [...] tank. Side striping replaced {{the hood and}} deck stripes for the GT sport stripes option. The custom interior's wood-trimmed molded door panels were replaced by vinyl door panels matching the seat trim. January saw plastic front fender liners added after thousands of fenders were replaced under warranty on 1971-1974 models. In February the [...] "Spirit of America" [...] limited-edition hatchback was introduced, with white exterior, white vinyl roof, blue and red striping on body sides, hood and rear-end panel, emblems on front fenders and rear panel, white [...] "GT" [...] wheels, A70-13 raised white-letter tires, white custom vinyl interior and red accent color carpeting. Seventy-five hundred Vegas were built through May. Sales peaked at 460,374 for the 1974 model year.|$|E
5000|$|The Dart name (rather than Aspen) {{was applied}} to Dodge-branded F-body cars in Mexico, {{corresponding}} to the Mexican Chrysler-branded F-body cars badged as Valiant Volare (without the [...] "é" [...] in the [...] "Volare" [...] nameplate). The F-body was withdrawn from production worldwide after 1980, but in Mexico the M-body was badged as a Dodge Dart for 1981 and 1982 using the front <b>header</b> <b>panel</b> and hood from the discontinued 1980 Volare/Aspen, the K-body was sold as a Dodge Dart K (and as a Valiant Volare K) from 1982 to 1989, and the E-body was sold as the Dodge Dart Europa, officially badged as the Dodge Dart E, from 1986 to 1989. It was a downscale (lower price, cheaper trim) version of the American Dodge 600 4-door sedan. It replaced the Dart K 4-door sedan. Dart K 2-door and wagon models were sold alongside the Dart E until 1988 and the old SOHC I-4 2.2 L engine {{was replaced by the}} new 2.5 L I-4 for the 1987 season. These were the last new cars in the world to bear the Dodge Dart name until its revival in 2013. The Dart name was dropped when Chrysler de México introduced the Spirit in 1990.|$|E
5000|$|In 1990, Cadillac {{offered a}} lower-priced ($53,050) {{companion}} {{model with a}} cloth convertible roof and without the removable aluminum hardtop, and a model including the hardtop at $58,638. By midyear, prices were dropped to $57,813 for the hardtop/convertible and $51,500 for the convertible, which included a $650 Gas Guzzler Tax along with $550 destination charge. The fully integrated cellular telephone, which was equipped from the factory on just 36 cars this year, was available for an additional $1,195. Allanté's bumper-to-bumper new car warranty, seven years and 100000 mi, was three years longer than other Cadillacs, and an additional 50000 mi of coverage. Allanté owners also received a special toll-free number to call for service or concerns. Headlamp washers and dual 10-way Recaro seating remained standard, among other niceties. A driver's side airbag {{was added to the}} leather-wrapped steering wheel, eliminating the telescoping steering wheel [...] - [...] which retained its tilt feature. The analog instrument cluster - introduced the previous year - was standard on the convertible (available at no extra cost on the hardtop/convertible), however, only 358 cars were equipped with the analog cluster. The power mirror control moved from the right of the steering column on the instrument panel to a new location on {{the upper end of the}} driver's door armrest, while the power seat switches (previously mounted on the face of the seat base) were relocated to the lower side trim of the seat base facing the door panels. The 3-channel garage door opener base mounted on the <b>header</b> <b>panel</b> above the windshield was eliminated when a revamped sun visor design was introduced this year. Technological news was the addition of traction control - the first front-wheel drive automobile with a V8 in the world to be equipped as such. The elaborate system was able to cut fuel to up to four cylinders to reduce power and optimize traction. The electronically controlled shock absorbers were retuned to remain in [...] "soft" [...] mode for up to 40 mph. Previously, they entered [...] "normal" [...] mode after just 25 mph. A revised audio system allowed a CD player to be added as standard equipment, along with the cassette player. Of the 2,523 built for 1990, only five were exported - four to Canada and one to Germany. Allanté was available in eight colors this year, the most popular was Euro Red, found on 1,012 cars, while the least chosen was Gray Metallic, with only 28 made. Interior color choices (and production figures) were Charcoal Gray (1,343), Natural Beige (767), and Maroon (413).|$|E
