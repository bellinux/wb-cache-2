This {{study was conducted to}} design a mechanism of oil palm fresh fruit bunches catchment and its potential energy utilization. The potential energy of falling fruit bunches during oil palm harvesting that stored in the <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>spring,</b> and used to drive the wheelbarrow. The actual energy potential and torque performance of <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>spring</b> was measured by using a torque and potential energy measuring apparatus. The results showed that the potential energy from falling fruit bunches could store in the <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>spring</b> mechanism, with storage efficiency of 39. 39 %. By means of 1. 5 rotation of <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>spring,</b> the maximum torque of the <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>spring</b> was 53. 35 Nm. The utilization of potential energy that stored in the <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>spring</b> has been successfully used to drive the wheelbarrow, with utilization efficiency of 80. 39 %. By using the potential energy of 38. 64 J, wheelbarrow could move as far as 0. 41 m to evacuate 48 kg of total weight loads...|$|E

The geometric parameters of spring are determined. The maximum deformation and the stress distribution of spring are obtained. Moreover, the modal analysis of spring is carried out and the natural frequencies and modes of vibration of first 20 orders are obtained. The relationship between the natural frequency and deformation is also analyzed. All the results in this paper provide a strong basis for the optimization design of spring and the calculation of energy density...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{investigates the}} use of the guard traces to improve the Time-Domain Transmission (TDT) {{waveform}} and eye diagram for a <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> delay line. Two types of guard trace are adopted to implement and analysis in microstrip line and stripline structures. One is Two Grounded Vias type Guard Trace (TGVGT) and the other is Open-Stub type Guard Trace (OSGT). The timedomain analysis results by HSPICE and the associated simple circuit modeling is presented. According to the simulation results, the original TDT crosstalk noises can be reduced by about 80 % when using TGVGTs or OSGTs in a stripline structure and by about 60 % when using TGVGTs in a microstrip line structure. Additionally, the eye diagrams also can obtain improvement. The crosstalk noise cancelation mechanisms of the <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> routing scheme on TGVGTs and OSGTs are investigated by graphic method. In addition, how the degradation for the OSGT inserted into the <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> delay line in microstrip structure is clearly investigated. A <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> delay line inserted into TGVGTs and OSGTs both can obtain good improvements of the TDT waveform and eye diagram in a stripline structure. Moreover, adding OSGTs to the <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> routing scheme is easily accomplished due to the open end of OSGTs. Finally, HSPICE simulation and time-domain measurements of crosstalk noises of TDT waveforms, and eye diagrams are use to validate the proposed structure and analysis...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} depth {{analysis}} of the inductive power transfer (or wireless power transfer, WPT) along a metamaterial composed of cells arranged in a planar configuration, in order to deliver power to a receiver sliding on them. In this way, the problem of the efficiency strongly affected by the weak coupling between emitter and receiver can be obviated, and the distance of transmission can significantly be increased. This study is made using a circuital approach and the magnetoinductive wave (MIW) theory, in order to simply explain the behavior of the transmission coefficient and efficiency from the circuital and experimental point of view. Moreover, <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> resonators are used as metamaterial cells, particularly indicated in literature for WPT metamaterials operating at MHz frequencies (5 - 30 MHz). Finally, this thesis presents a complete electrical characterization of multilayer and multiturn <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> resonators and, in particular, it proposes a new approach for the resistance calculation through finite element simulations, in order to consider all the high frequency parasitic effects.

40|$|Abstract: The {{pressure}} {{distribution in}} a <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> groove thrust bearing {{obtained from a}} straightforward solution of the Reynolds equation includes subatmospheric pressure in part of the grooved area. This is masked in the common theory {{based on the assumption}} of an infinite number of grooves. Furthermore, the negative contribution to the load capacity from this area is usually small, which may explain why the presence of subatmospheric pressure has not been given much attention in connectionwith these bearings. Subatmospheric pressure is, however, necessary for liquid-lubricated <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> groove thrust bearings of conventional design to work at all at low numbers of grooves, which in turn requires a non-zero cavitation pressure. Cavitation within individual grooves implies non-linearity in, for example, the relation between load capacity and rotational speed of the bearing and limits the obtainable load capacity. This is more pronounced and important to consider at low numbers of grooves (wide grooves) than at high numbers of grooves (narrow grooves), {{and it is difficult to}} determine for what number of grooves that reliable prediction of bearing performance can be expected. It depends on the actual value of the cavitation pressure and other parameters that are usually unknown or difficult to account for. To avoid this disadvantage a modified design of liquid-lubricated <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> groove thrust bearings is suggested...|$|R

The temperature-dependent neutron diffraction results prove that this intermetallic phase shows a complex <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> magnetic ordering, presenting three subsequent changes in magnetization at T-m 1 (Neu) similar to 100 K, T-m 2 (Neu) = 62 (4) K and T-m 3 (Neu) = 54 (4) K on cooling. However, the magnetization data depict two transitions at 72 K (T-N 1) and 55 K (T-N 2). The extended temperature range between T-m 1 (Neu) and T-m 2 (Neu) over which the neutron diffraction patterns slowly evolve might correspond to the high-temperature anti ferromagnetic transition at T-N 1 and low-temperature antiferromagnetic transition at T-N 2 of the magnetic data. Between T-m 1 (Neu) similar to 100 k and T-m 2 (Neu) = 62 (4) KTb 5 Si 3 shows a <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> antiferromagnetic ordering with a propagation vector K- 1 = [0, 0, +/- 1 / 4]; then, between T-m 2 (Neu) = 62 (4) K and T-m 3 (Neu) = 54 (4) K the <b>flat</b> <b>spiral</b> type ordering is conserved, but by two coexisting propagation vectors K- 1 = [0, 0, +/- 1 / 4] and K- 2 = [0, 0, +/- 0. 4644 (3) ].
