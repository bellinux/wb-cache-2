40|$|The fishery {{products}} {{are well known}} for their specific nutritional qualities and health authorities promote information campaigns to increase their consumption. Despite the important role in human diet, such foods may represent, to some extent, an exposure source to environmental pollution by lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic. The toxic effect of these heavy metals and metalloids on human health is well established and their presence {{represents one of the}} main chemical risks associated with {{fishery products}} consumption. The aim of the present thesis was to provide an updated survey on the presence of these contaminants and to conduct a risk assessment on fishery products. The study was carried out in Sardinia on the coastal areas near mining territories (Sulcis-Iglesiente) and on more extensive stretches of the Mediterranean Sea. As an indication of environmental pollution various <b>edible</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organism</b> were monitored by the determination of contaminants bioaccumulation along the aquatic trophic chain. In addition data available from the Zooprofilattici Institutes laboratories were used to investigate the distribution of such contaminants in fishery products placed on the market. The level of exposure of the population was assessed using various approaches. Our research suggest that exposure assessment should be conducted taking into account risk/benefit ratio and differences in vulnerable groups, such as children and pregnant women, and dietary habits of coastal population...|$|R

40|$|Marine {{toxicity}} is a {{major concern}} in the countries that depend on marine foods. Recently, several reports have appeared that shows novel kinds of toxic compounds and their effects. Present review focuses on the overall view of the marine toxicity in the recent times and their repercussions on human health. Various toxins were discovered in the last decades and still not all have been studied in detail due to the challenging processing methods involved. Especially, the number of cases involving intoxication caused due to consumption of poisonous sea foods like fish, oysters and claims have increased bringing in unknown toxins or new analogue of known toxins, thus increasing the scope to investigate the marine environment. Harmful algal blooms and their effects on the other <b>edible</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> is also of major concern as it directly affects the economy of many coastal belts and so the effect of algal blooms is highlighted.

40|$|Palytoxin (PLTX) is {{a highly}} toxic {{hydrophilic}} polyether detected in several <b>edible</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> from intra-tropical areas, where seafood poisoning were reported. Symptoms usually start with gastro-intestinal malaise, often accompanied by myalgia, muscular cramps, dyspnea and, sometimes, arrhythmias. Monitoring programs in the Mediterranean Sea have detected PLTX-like molecules in edible mollusks and echinoderms. Despite the potential exposure of the human population and its high toxic potential, the toxicological profile of the molecule is still an issue. Thus, the effects of repeated oral administration of PLTX in mice were investigated. Seven days of PLTX administration caused lethality and toxic effects at doses ≥ 30 μg/kg/day. A NOAEL was estimated equal to 3 μg/kg/day, indicating a quite steep dose-response curve. This value, due to {{the limited number of}} animal tested, is provisional, although represents a sound basis for further testing. Macroscopic alterations at gastrointestinal level (gastric ulcers and intestinal fluid accumulation) were observed in mice dead during the treatment period. Histological analysis highlighted severe inflammation, locally associated with necrosis, at pulmonary level, as well as hyper-eosinophilia and fiber separation in myocardium. A cardiac damage was supported by the in vitro effect of the toxin on cardiomyocytes, indicating a severe and irreversible impairment of their electrical properties: electrophysiological recordings detected a progressive cell depolarization, arrest of action potentials and beating...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A {{wide variety}} of {{environmental}} pollutants occur in surface waters, including estuarine and marine waters. Many of these contaminants are recognised as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) which can adversely affect {{the male and female}} reproductive system by binding the estrogen receptor and exhibiting hormone-like activities. In this study the estrogenic activity of extracts of <b>edible</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> for human consumption from the Mediterranean Sea was assayed. Methods Marine organisms were collected in two different areas of the Mediterranean Sea. The estrogenic activity of tissues was assessed using an in vitro yeast reporter gene assay (S. cerevisiae RMY 326 ER-ERE). Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (congeners 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, 180) in fish tissue was also evaluated. Results Thirty-eight percent of extracts showed a hormone-like activity higher than 10 % of the activity elicited by 10 nM 17 b-estradiol (E 2) used as control. Total PCB concentrations ranged from 0. 002 up to 1. 785 ng/g wet weight. Chemical analyses detected different levels of contamination among the species collected in the two areas, with the ones collected in the Adriatic Sea showing concentrations significantly higher than those collected in the Tyrrhenian Sea (p Conclusion The more frequent combination of chemicals in the samples that showed higher estrogenic activity was PCB 28, PCB 101, PCB 153, PCB 180. The content of PCBs and estrogenic activity did not reveal any significant correlation. </p...|$|E

40|$|Azaspiracids (AZAs) are a toxin {{group that}} {{originate}} from marine dinoflagellates {{of the genera}} Azadinium and Amphidoma. After accumulation of these toxins in <b>edible</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> and their subsequent consumption, humans develop a gastrointestinal syndrome referred to as azaspiracid shellfish poisoning (AZP). This syndrome {{is very similar to}} diarrheic shellfish poisoning (DSP), with main symptoms appearing after a few hours from consumption and including diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach cramps. Due to extensive metabolism in shellfish, more than 30 analogues have been reported to date, and purified compounds for selected analogues have recently been made available for toxicological studies. Currently, only AZA 1, AZA 2, and AZA 3 are regulated in Europe and internationally; however, more recent evidence suggests that AZA 6, AZA 17, and AZA 19 may also be analogues of importance for estimating the full risk of seafood. Even though animal studies have pointed out target organs (digestive tract, liver, heart, and lung), mechanism of action studies at cellular level are not yet conclusive. While a number of common targets have been excluded (protein phosphatases, kinases, actin depolymerization, G protein-coupled receptors), some evidence points toward ion channel activity of AZAs. Still, in vitro studies do not correlate well with symptoms observed in humans. Also, while some animal studies point toward longer-term effects, no such evidence has been reported from human poisoning events. However, {{it should be noted that}} in-depth epidemiological studies are still lacking. Even though all risk assessments have based their evaluation on a single, relatively early poisoning event in 1997, in Arranmore Island, Ireland, producing organisms and toxin occurrences have been reported worldwide, and further occurrence studies should provide a better base for such epidemiological studie...|$|E
40|$|Between June 1946 and October 1958, Enewetak and Bikini Atolls {{were used}} by the United States as testing grounds for 66 nuclear devices. The {{combined}} explosive yield from these tests was 107 Mt (Mt TNT equivalents). This testing produced close-in fallout debris that was contaminated with quantities of radioactive fission and particle activated products, and unspent radioactive nuclear fuel that entered the aquatic environment of the atolls. Today, the sediments in the lagoons are reservoirs for 10 's of TBq of the transuranics and some long-lived fission and activation products. The larger amounts of contamination are associated with fine and coarse sediment material adjacent to {{the locations of the}} high yield explosions. Radionuclides are also distributed vertically in the sediment column to various depths in all regions of the lagoons. Concentrations greater than fallout background levels are found in filtered water sampled over several decades from all locations and depths in the lagoons. This is a direct indication that the radionuclides are continuously mobilized to solution from the solid phases. Of particular importance {{is the fact that the}} long-lived radionuclides are accumulated to different levels by indigenous aquatic plants and organisms that are used as food by resident people. One might anticipate finding continuous high contamination levels in many of the <b>edible</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> from the lagoons, since the radionuclides associated with the sediments are not contained and are available to the different organisms in a relatively shallow water environment. This is not the case. We estimate that the radiological dose from consumption of the edible parts of marine foods at Enewetak and Bikini is presently about 0. 05 % of the total 50 -year integral effective dose from all other exposure pathways that include ingestion of terrestrial foods and drinking water, external exposure and inhalation. The total radiological dose from the marine pathway is dominated by the natural radionuclides, {sup 210 }Po and {sup 210 }Pb. Man-made radionuclides presently contribute less than 0. 3 % of the dose from these natural radionuclides in the marine food chain...|$|E
