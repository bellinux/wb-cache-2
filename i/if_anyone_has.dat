5|$|Frankie adores {{the world}} and goes to visit it every day, being treated like royalty by the voice. But one day, when she goes to leave, the friend refuses to allow her and locks every exit in the castle they are abiding in. Bloo, Mac, Coco, Eduardo, and Wilt become curious with her sudden disappearance. They {{go up to the}} attic and enter the toy box, {{discovering}} for themselves the vast world that resides in it. They ask around a small town <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>has</b> seen a woman of Frankie's description but nobody responds. A group of weeble policemen discover they have entered {{the world and}} chase after them, but the gang are saved by a heroic man. He tries to warn them that their pursuit of Frankie will lead through extremely dangerous environments, but they are determined to rescue her. Mr. Herriman, in the meantime, is outraged by Frankie's disappearance and attempts to find a replacement for her, but to no avail.|$|E

Pam and Jim pretend that they've {{never heard of the}} movie, and Pam {{suggests}} that Michael is thinking of the 1990 movie The Hunt for Red October. Upon boarding, Michael soon stands {{at the front of the}} boat and yells, [...] "I'm the king of the world!" [...] in reference to the famous scene in Titanic.|$|E

500|$|The family {{begins to}} regret all the disgusting things they said about their dog, and Bart goes {{from house to}} house asking <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>has</b> seen him.

500|$|Resting in a shed after marching , Rabbi Eliahou asks <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>has</b> {{seen his}} son. They had stuck {{together}} for three years, [...] "always near each other, for suffering, for blows, for the ration of bread, for prayer," [...] but the rabbi had {{lost sight of}} him in the crowd and was now scratching through the snow looking for his son's corpse. [...] "I hadn't any strength left for running. And my son didn't notice. That's all I know." [...] Eliezer does not tell the man that his son had indeed noticed his father limping, and had run faster, letting the distance between them grow.|$|E
500|$|Mark Hanna and William McKinley {{continued}} their friendship as they assumed their offices in March 1897. [...] Senator Hanna {{was looking for}} a residence; President McKinley suggested that he stay at the Executive Mansion (as the White House was still formally known) until he found one. [...] According to Hearst's New York Journal, [...] "the Senator doubtless feels that <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>has</b> the right to make himself at home in the White House he is the man". [...] Hanna soon moved into the Arlington Hotel, close to the White House, where he occupied a large suite. [...] After the death of Vice President Hobart in November 1899, Hanna took over the lease on his house on Lafayette Square, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House.|$|E

Though he first agreed on helping him, Chuck changes his mind because he doesn't want to destroy Blair's dream and only wants her happiness.|$|E
500|$|The first {{recorded}} {{use of the}} term McCarthyism was in a political cartoon by Washington Post editorial cartoonist Herbert Block (aka Herblock), published on March 29, 1950. The cartoon depicted four leading Republicans trying to push an elephant (the traditional symbol of the Republican Party) to stand on a platform atop a teetering stack of ten tar buckets, the topmost of which was labeled [...] "McCarthyism". Block later wrote that there was [...] "nothing particularly ingenious about the term, which is simply used to represent a national affliction that can hardly be described in any other way. <b>If</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>has</b> a prior claim on it, he's welcome to the word and to the junior senator from Wisconsin along with it. I will also throw in a set of free dishes and a case of soap." ...|$|E

Another cutaway gag features Peter in the famed Peanuts bit in which Lucy pulls the football away from Charlie Brown, with Peter attacking {{her until she}} cries and promises to never pull the same stunt. Brian brags over his previous work as an actor, which he proves by showing a scene from Die Hard [...] in which the animated Brian is inserted into the live action next to Reginald VelJohnson and Paul Gleason. When Rita is introduced to the Griffins, Peter jokes about her age by asking <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>has</b> made any [...] "Jessica Tandy jokes" [...] yet.

500|$|Because {{none of the}} {{witnesses}} can agree on the language the murderer spoke, Dupin concludes they were not hearing a human voice at all. He and the narrator examine the house thoroughly; the following day, Dupin dismisses the idea of both Le Bon's guilt and a robbery motive, citing {{the fact that the}} gold was not taken from the room. He also points out that the murderer would have had to have superhuman strength to force the daughter's body up the chimney. He formulates a method by which the murderer could have entered the room and killed both women, involving an agile climb up a lightning rod and a leap to a set of open window shutters. Showing an unusual tuft of hair he recovered from the scene, and demonstrating the impossibility of the daughter being strangled by a human hand, Dupin concludes that an [...] "Ourang-Outang" [...] (orangutan) killed the women. He has placed an advertisement in the local newspaper asking <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>has</b> lost such an animal, and a sailor soon arrives looking for it.|$|E

In {{an interview with}} The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet, when asked, [...] "What if [...] never heard the prophecy?", she said, [...] "It's the 'Macbeth' idea. I absolutely adore 'Macbeth.' It is possibly my favourite Shakespeare play. And that's the question isn't it? If Macbeth hadn't met the witches, would he have killed Duncan? Would any of it have happened? Is it fated or did he make it happen? I believe he made it happen." [...] On her website, she referred to Macbeth again in discussing the prophecy: [...] "the prophecy (like the one the witches make to Macbeth, <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>has</b> read the play of the same name) becomes the catalyst for a situation that would never have occurred {{if it had not}} been made." [...] More playfully, Rowling also invented a musical band popular in the Wizarding world called The Weird Sisters that appears in passing in several books in the series as well as the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The third Harry Potter movie's soundtrack featured a song by John Williams called [...] "Double Trouble", a reference to the witches' line, [...] "Double double, toil and trouble". The lyrics of the song were adapted from the Three Witches' spell in the play.|$|E

2500|$|In the passage, Jesus has {{sat down}} in the temple to teach some of the people, after he spent the {{previous}} night at the Mount of Olives. [...] A group of scribes and Pharisees confront Jesus, interrupting his teaching session. They bring in a woman, accusing her of committing adultery, claiming she was caught in the very act. They ask Jesus whether the punishment for someone like her should be stoning, as prescribed by Mosaic Law. Jesus first ignores the interruption, and writes on the ground as though he does not hear them. But when the woman's accusers continue their challenge, he states that the one who is without sin is the one who should cast the first stone. The accusers and congregants depart, leaving Jesus alone with the woman. [...] Jesus asks the woman <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>has</b> condemned her. She answers that no one has condemned her. Jesus says that he, too, does not condemn her, and tells her to go and sin no more.|$|E
2500|$|Dante {{wakes up}} to find that he has crossed the Acheron, and Virgil leads him to the first circle of the abyss, Limbo, where Virgil himself resides. The first circle {{contains}} the unbaptized and the virtuous pagans, who, although not sinful, did not accept Christ. Dorothy L. Sayers writes, [...] "After those who refused choice come those without opportunity of choice. They could not, that is, choose Christ; they could, and did, choose human virtue, and for that they have their reward." [...] Limbo shares many characteristics with the Asphodel Meadows; thus, the guiltless damned are punished by living in a deficient form of Heaven. Without baptism ("the portal of the faith that you embrace") they lacked the hope for something greater than rational minds can conceive. When Dante asked <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>has</b> ever left Limbo, Virgil states that he saw Jesus ("a Mighty One") descend into Limbo and take Noah, Moses, Abraham, David, and Rachel (see Limbo of the Patriarchs) into his all-forgiving arms and transport them to Heaven as the first human souls to be saved. The event, known as the Harrowing of Hell, would have occurred in A.D. 33 or 34.|$|E
