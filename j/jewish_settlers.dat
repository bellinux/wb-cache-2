5|$|The British {{were eager}} {{not to lose}} any useful {{inhabitants}} and promised religious tolerance to the French colonists; ultimately 112 French colonists remained in Mobile. The first permanent <b>Jewish</b> <b>settlers</b> came to Mobile in 1763 {{as a result of}} the new British rule and religious tolerance. Jews had not been allowed to officially reside in colonial French Louisiana due to the Code Noir, a decree passed by France's King Louis XIV in 1685 that forbade the exercise of any religion other than Roman Catholicism, and ordered all Jews out of France's colonies. Most of these colonial-era Jews in Mobile were merchants and traders from Sephardic Jewish communities in Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina; they added to the commercial development of Mobile. In 1766 the total population was estimated to be 860, though the town's borders were smaller than during the French colonial period. During the American Revolutionary War, West Florida and Mobile became a refuge for loyalists fleeing the other colonies.|$|E
