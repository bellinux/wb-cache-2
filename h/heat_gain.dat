25|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>gain</b> is {{the heat}} {{accumulated}} {{from the sun}} in the system. Solar thermal heat is trapped using the greenhouse effect; the greenhouse effect {{in this case is}} the ability of a reflective surface to transmit short wave radiation and reflect long wave radiation. Heat and infrared radiation (IR) are produced when short wave radiation light hits the absorber plate, which is then trapped inside the collector. Fluid, usually water, in the absorber tubes collect the trapped heat and transfer it to a heat storage vault.|$|E
25|$|The thermoregulatory model {{explaining}} {{the origin of}} bipedalism {{is one of the}} simplest theories so far advanced, but it is a viable explanation. Dr. Peter Wheeler, a professor of evolutionary biology, proposes that bipedalism raises the amount of body surface area higher above the ground which results in a reduction in <b>heat</b> <b>gain</b> and helps heat dissipation. When a hominid is higher above the ground, the organism accesses more favorable wind speeds and temperatures. During heat seasons, greater wind flow results in a higher heat loss, which makes the organism more comfortable. Also, Wheeler explains that a vertical posture minimizes the direct exposure to the sun whereas quadrupedalism exposes more of the body to direct exposure. Analysis and interpretations of Ardipithecus reveal that this hypothesis needs modification to consider that the forest and woodland environmental preadaptation of early-stage hominid bipedalism preceded further refinement of bipedalism by the pressure of natural selection. This then allowed for the more efficient exploitation of the hotter conditions ecological niche, rather than the hotter conditions being hypothetically bipedalism's initial stimulus. A feedback mechanism from the advantages of bipedality in hot and open habitats would then in turn make a forest preadaptation solidify as a permanent state.|$|E
50|$|In air systems, {{convective}} <b>heat</b> <b>gains</b> {{are assumed}} to become a cooling load instantly. Radiative <b>heat</b> <b>gains</b> are absorbed by walls, floors, ceilings, and furnishings causing an increase in their temperature which will then transfer heat to the space's air by convection.

The resulting cooling load through different air system types in the same built environment can be different.|$|R

25|$|There {{are several}} types of {{different}} materials that are used throughout this building. The main materials used in the building envelope consist of concrete, glass, granite and steel. The curtain wall facade of this building uses large glass panels, framed with black granite framing. While the glass used for the lower box is completely transparent, the curtain wall for the upper seven floors uses fritted glass {{with a series of}} light gray circles, each approximately the size of a CD. This creates a protective screen that hinders view out from the building, but provides privacy to its users while reducing <b>heat</b> <b>gain,</b> and maintaining a certain level of sophistication is its aesthetics at the same time. Each of the twelve hypostyle columns are made of reinforced concrete. The columns supporting the tower are Agilia Concrete, which is more enhanced in design effect and construction process compared to traditional concretes: it can be placed 50% faster than the traditional concrete, and form complex shapes that would have been impossible in previous years. Each colossal column spans spanning one meter in diameter and 19 meters high; each one was constructed in a single pour in order to achieve the highest quality and a sense of grace and elegance. A striking urban colonnade is created through this series of columns; asserting its presence on campus while setting distinct boundaries between the street, public space of the campus and the privacy of the pharmacy faculty. Self-compacting concrete is used as the structural support system {{throughout the rest of the}} structure. The pods were constructed as “steel baskets” suspended by steel rods. The shells of these pods are constructed of structural steel and plaster and silver reflective paint are used for the finishes of these pods.|$|E

40|$|AbstractImproving {{the energy}} {{performance}} of buildings can contribute substantially to reducing energy demand. To evaluate the useful energy demand for space heating purposes from an energy economics perspective norm-based bottom-up models are applied that capture the energy-related characteristics of buildings. As electricity demand per household attributed to appliances and lighting has increased substantially in the EU 27 {{during the last}} two decades (+ 50 %), the question arises whether the static norm-based approach is underestimating the contribution of internal <b>heat</b> <b>gains</b> to covering useful energy demand. To analyze the impact of dynamic internal <b>heat</b> <b>gains</b> in the residential sector, a bottom-up vintage model is applied that covers the EU 27 building stock with a country-specific typology. This means the internal <b>heat</b> <b>gains</b> are time-dependent and heat dissipation is distinguished by appliances, lighting and residents. The analysis consists of two explorative scenarios for the residential building stock of EU 27 until 2050. A reference scenario represents the static norm-based modelling of internal <b>heat</b> <b>gains</b> while the second scenario considers their dynamic development. The study reveals that the norm-based approach underestimates the contribution of internal <b>heat</b> <b>gains</b> to covering thermal heat demand. Comparing the countries throughout the EU 27 climate zones indicates that on average the static and the dynamic share of internal <b>heat</b> <b>gains</b> differ in a range from 20 - 70 % by 2050. Especially in the case of nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (nZEB), e. g. with 30 kWh/m 2 *a useful energy demand, the internal <b>heat</b> <b>gains</b> are about 10 - 15 % higher using the dynamic approach compared to the norm-based approach...|$|R

The west and east elevations were predominantly windowless to occlude the harsh, low sun and were built of concrete to provide a thermal mass quality. In contrast, the photographic and computational spaces that required highly controlled light and ventilation conditions were located in the basement levels, which had deep floor plans and limited fenestration.|$|E
