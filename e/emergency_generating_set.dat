40|$|Abstract. A module M over a ring R is said {{to satisfy}} (P) if every gen-erating set of M {{contains}} an independent <b>generating</b> <b>set.</b> The following results are proved; (1) Let τ = (Tτ,Fτ) be a hereditary torsion theory such that Tτ 6 = Mod-R. Then every τ-torsionfree R-module satisfies (P) {{if and only if}} S = R/τ(R) is a division ring. (2) Let K be a hereditary pre-torsion class of modules. Then every module in K satisfies (P) if and only if either K = { 0 } or S = R/SocK(R) is a division ring, where SocK(R) = ∩{I ≤ RR: R/I ∈ K}. For a right R-moduleM, a subset X ofM {{is said to}} be a <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> ofM if M = Σx∈XxR; and a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of M is any <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> Y of M such that no proper subset of Y can generate M. A <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> X of M is called an independent <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> if Σx∈XxR = ⊕x∈XxR. Clearly, every independent <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of M is a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set,</b> but the converse is not true in general. For example, the set { 2, 3 } is a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of ZZ but not an independent <b>generating</b> <b>set.</b> It is well-known that every <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of a right vector space over a division ring contains a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> (or a basis). This motivated various interests in characterizing the rings R such that every module in a certain class of right R-modules contains a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set,</b> or every <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of each module in a certain class of right R-modules contains a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> (see, for example, [2], [8], [9], [11]). In [2, Theorem 2. 3], the authors proved that R is a division ring if and only if every R-module has a basis if and only if every irredundant subset of an R-module is independent. This result can be considered in a more general context of a torsion theory. For anR-moduleM,M is said to satisfy (P) if ever...|$|R

D., Department of Algebra Abstract: By a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of a module we mean a subset which generates the module but {{any of its}} proper subsets does not. If the module is not finitely generated, an {{existence}} of a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> is not guaranteed. We say that a module is weakly based {{if it has a}} minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set.</b> In the presented thesis, we provide a characterization of weakly based modules over Dedekind domains. As an application of this, we show that the class of weakly based modules is not closed under extensions and the complement of this class is not closed under finite direct sums. Also, we show an example of an abelian group which is weakly based if and only if CH holds. Then we treat rings such that all modules are weakly based. We prove that a Baer regular ring has this property if and only if it is semisimple, and we show that any ℵ 0 -noetherian commutative semiartinian ring has this property.
