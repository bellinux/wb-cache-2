Disenchanted with Alcibiades but still determined to overthrow the democracy, Peisander and his companions returned to Samos, where the conspirators worked to secure their control over the army and encouraged a group of native Samian oligarchs to begin planning the overthrow of their own city's democracy. In Athens, meanwhile, a party of young oligarchic revolutionaries succeeded in gaining de facto control of the government through assassination and intimidation.|$|E

Warren and Tyagi point out that a fully employed worker today earns less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker did 30years ago. Although families spend less today on clothing, appliances, and other consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care have increased dramatically. The result is that even with two income earners, families are {{no longer able to}} save and have incurred <b>greater</b> <b>and</b> <b>greater</b> debt.|$|E

After briefly partnering with Ken Briscoe (Chris Orbach), she becomes the {{permanent}} partner of John Munch (Richard Belzer) after his previous partner, Brian Cassidy (Dean Winters), leaves the unit. The two occasionally clash personalities and have a sarcastic rapport with each other. While chasing a rape suspect during one case, Jeffries is nearly killed when the suspect gets into a car that explodes. She initially appears traumatized by the incident, but later feels exhilarated over having survived and starts behaving recklessly. She begins having several one-night stands and takes <b>greater</b> <b>and</b> <b>greater</b> risks at work, becoming something of a loose cannon at the Special Victims Unit. One night at a bar, she meets {{a man who had}} been a suspect in a previous rape case and has sex with him. When she reveals the incident during a session with a police therapist, she is taken out of active duty per One Police Plaza and works a desk job. She objects to the transfer and threatens to sue the department. Instead, she is transferred to the Vice department, and her old job in the Special Victims Unit is taken by Fin Tutuola (Ice-T).|$|E

25|$|Following the Reformation, {{the name}} of the church was {{shortened}} to Vrouwekerk because the original name, Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk, was considered too Catholic-sounding.

As <b>greater</b> <b>and</b> <b>greater</b> numbers of religious refugees came to Leiden in the 17th Century, the parish grew to some 6,000 members.

Guderian's book incorporated the work of theorists such as Ludwig Ritter von Eimannsberger, whose book, The Tank War (Der Kampfwagenkrieg) (1934) gained a wide audience in the German army. Another German theorist, Ernst Volckheim, wrote a huge amount on tank and combined arms tactics and was influential to German thinking {{on the use of}} armoured formations but his work was not acknowledged in Guderian's writings.|$|E

The League had this hold over the royalty because of the loans the Hansa had made to the royalty and the large debt the kings were carrying. The League's monopolistic control over the economy of Norway put pressure on all classes, especially the peasantry, to the degree that no real burgher class existed in Norway.|$|E

Their experiment for the expected motion of the Earth relative to the aether, the hypothetical medium in which light was supposed to travel, resulted in a null result. Surprised, Michelson repeated the experiment with <b>greater</b> <b>and</b> <b>greater</b> precision over the next years, but continued to find no ability to measure the aether. The Michelson-Morley results were immensely influential in the physics community, leading Hendrik Lorentz to devise his now-famous Lorentz contraction equations {{as a means of}} explaining the null result.|$|E
25|$|It {{can also}} be shown that if an extreme point is not a maximum point of the {{objective}} function then there is an edge containing the point so that the objective function is strictly increasing on the edge {{moving away from the}} point. If the edge is finite then the edge connects to another extreme point where the objective function has a greater value, otherwise the objective function is unbounded above on the edge and the linear program has no solution. The simplex algorithm applies this insight by walking along edges of the polytope to extreme points with <b>greater</b> <b>and</b> <b>greater</b> objective values. This continues until the maximum value is reached or an unbounded edge is visited, concluding that the problem has no solution. The algorithm always terminates because the number of vertices in the polytope is finite; moreover since we jump between vertices always in the same direction (that of the objective function), we hope that the number of vertices visited will be small.|$|E
