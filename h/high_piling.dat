The line operated 3.59 miles of track from Colchester, Connecticut, to Turnerville (now known as Amston, Connecticut) and it opened on August 3, 1877. The line was leased on April 3, 1878 to the Boston & New York Air Line Railroad company for 999 years. In January 1879, the Air Line reported that the Black Ledge bridge had 25,000 yards of earth moved to replace a <b>high</b> <b>piling</b> and 2,500 cubic yards of masonry added {{in preparation for the}} installation of a new bridge. In 1881, the Air Line announced the replacement of the Howe truss and the installation of a new [...] iron bridge. On October 1, 1882, the line was leased to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad for 99 years. The Air Line reported to the Railroad Commissioners in 1899 that a bridge over Blackledge River was completed. The New York, New Haven and Hartford dominated the region by 1905, having acquiring over three dozen railroads. In 1907, the company sought to improve and modernize the Air Line. On April 17, 1911, the company petitioned the Railroad Commissioners for alterations and changes. The approval for the changes came on July 7, 1911.|$|E

As part of this, 38 m deep reinforced concrete piles were placed through each of the 293 tubes. A further 160 temporary anchor piles and ties were installed to provide restraint for the cofferdam wall.|$|E

A system for carpets with low pile construction and without color patterns has been developed. Appearance changes in carpets with <b>high</b> <b>pile</b> construction were still not well detected. We present an approach based on surface metrology that extract information {{given by the}} hairs on the carpet surface. These features are complementary to the texture features previously explored.

30|$|The results {{obtained}} {{in this study}} are also in line with the data reported by Zhu et al. for rubber seeds after 2  month of storage in open crates at 27  °C and 51  % relative humidity (330  %). Worse results were reported by Zhu et al. for rubber seeds stored in piles, which showed a 1400 relative increase in acid content upon storage at 27  °C. This is likely due to poor ventilation leading to a <b>higher</b> <b>pile</b> temperature and Mildew infection [15].|$|R

However, soon a slick-talking salesman named Joe Muffaw encourages the loggers to forget that work and [...] "be modern" [...] by using gas-powered chainsaws and a steam train to transport the timber (up until this point Babe would carry the timber to market on his back). Paul protests that nothing can replace {{the heart and soul}} of himself and Babe, and the men decide to host a tournament with only one rule, whomever creates the <b>highest</b> <b>pile</b> of lumber at the end of one's day work will be declared the superior logger, and the men will adopt the ways of the winner. Paul and Joe work tirelessly throughout the tournament, with Babe furiously racing against the steam train. When time is up, the referee measures Paul Bunyan's pile as 240 feet, and the men cheer. The referee then measures Joe's pile as 240 feet...and one quarter inch. Although most of the men don't think that quarter of an inch was a big deal, the rule was whomever made the <b>highest</b> <b>pile,</b> thus Joe wins. Paul and Babe despondently walk off into the sunset, never to return, but one of the men decides to record the legend of Paul Bunyan and Babe for posterity's sake. Some say they went up to Alaska, and their playful wrestling is what causes the Aurora Borealis in the night sky.|$|R
