50|$|Just {{prior to}} release, the {{aircraft}} activates the Release Consent discrete and sends the weapon an arming command using the MIL-STD-1553 interface. The SMS will {{verify that the}} weapon release conditions have all been fulfilled, and it will activate the signals (not part of the MIL-STD-1760 interface) that cause the weapon to be released. In {{the case of a}} bomb, this is typically done by energizing an <b>electro-explosive</b> <b>device</b> that simultaneously opens the hooks that hold the bomb on the aircraft during carriage, and also operate a plunger that pushes the bomb away from the aircraft (at high speeds there is a tendency for the weapon to remain in close proximity to the aircraft after the bomb hooks open). The MIL-STD-1760 connector will release as the bomb falls away from the aircraft, and the SMS will detect that the bomb has separated by the open circuit between the Interlock and Interlock Return discrete signals.|$|E

40|$|<b>Electro-explosive</b> <b>devices</b> (an {{electric}} resistance encapsulated by a primary explosive) fundamentally convert electrical energy into thermal energy, {{to start off}} an explosive chemical reaction. Obviously, the activation of those devices shall not happen by accident or, even worse, by intentional exogenous influence. From an ordinary differential equation, which describes the electro-explosive thermal behavior, a remarkable, but certainly not intuitive, dependence of the temperature response on the time constant of the heat transfer process is verified: the temperature profile dramatically changes as the time constant spans {{a wide range of}} values, from much lesser than the pulse width to much greater than the pulse period. Based on this dependence, important recommendations, concerning the efficient and safety operation of <b>electro-explosive</b> <b>devices,</b> are proposed...|$|R

The use of established nondestructive test technology for examining the quality and firing characteristics of <b>electro-explosive</b> <b>devices</b> has been successfully applied to the inspection and prediction of the functional performance of electrical fuses. The technique requires application of a low level current pulse to the electrical fuse with an oscilloscope display of the curve as generated by the temperature coefficient of resistance feedback. The heating curve of temperature vs time is composed of one predominant thermal time constant, which is the product of the test unit's thermal capacity and thermal resistance. It has been found that the quality of the individual electrical fuse, for instance, the relative condition of the critical internal weld or solder joint, can be examined nondestructively...|$|R
40|$|TechDemoSat- 1 is a UK-funded {{technology}} demonstration satellite, carrying 8 payloads {{provided by}} UK organisations, which {{is due to}} be launched {{in the first quarter of}} 2014. Cranfield University has supplied a De-Orbit Sail (DOS) payload to allow the mission to comply with end-of-life debris mitigation guidelines. The payload provides a passive, simple, and low-cost means of mitigating debris proliferation in Low Earth Orbit, by enhancing spacecraft aerodynamic drag at end-of-life and reducing time to natural orbital decay and re-entry.

40|$|Abstract. Functional {{manufacturing}} {{technologies are}} becoming more and more important to the manufacturing industry and research. As promising categories of functional manufacturing, micro and nano manufacturing have received steadily growing interests in recent years. In this paper, as typical examples to demonstrate micro and nano manufacturing, our work on microthruster, nano energetic material, and micro/nano initiator is presented. Microspacecraft is one application of microsystem in space. In a microspacecraft, a micropropulsion system is required for station keeping, attitude control, and orbit adjust. New silicon and ceramic microthrusters are described. Energetic materials including propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnics have found diverse applications. Nano energetic materials (nEMs) have improved performances in energy release, ignition, and mechanical properties compared to their bulk/micro counterparts. A novel nano Al and CuO nanowire based nEM is discussed. <b>Electro-explosive</b> <b>devices</b> (EEDs) activated by electrical energy are used to initiate an explosive, burning, electrical, or mechanical train. EEDs have found numerous applications in triggering the inflation of airbags in automobiles, micropropulsion, and arm fire/safe devices for ordnance systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: During field trials, it was {{observed}} that the delay of ignition of <b>electro-explosive</b> <b>devices</b> (EED) depends on ratings of power supplies or dynamo and also on the firing cable lengths. The change in ignition delay of EEDs due to altered supplied current will detoriate the repeatability of sequence of actions in time-critical armament applications. In order to study, supplement and analyze this observation, the measurement of electrical energy required for EEDs ignition is necessary. The electrical energy of EEDs has been determined experimentally by instrumentation and measurement setup using hall sensor and photo detector. The hall sensor is used to measure the actual current passing through EEDs when power supply is applied to them. Photo detector is used to detect the flash produced during EED ignition. By conducting repeated trials, it {{was observed}} that this method is reliable to determine the electrical energy required for EEDs ignition. With this parameter, the actual current to be supplied and the pulse width of supplied current for repeated ignition delays can be determined. Knowing the electrical energy of a particular EED by the proposed method, the required firing cable length and power supply for ignition of critical delay applications can be selected. This method also helps to design explosive-based ignition systems in defence applications...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{efficient}} methods for protecting <b>electro-explosive</b> <b>devices</b> (EED's) from HERO and ESD is to shield the EED in a conducting shell (Faraday cage). Electrical energy is transferred to the bridge {{by means of a}} magnetic coupling which passes through a portion of the conducting shell that is made from a magnetically permeable but electrically conducting material. This technique was perfected by ML Aviation, a U. K. company, in the early 80 's, and was called a Radio Frequency Attenuation Connector (RFAC). It is now in wide use in the U. K. Previously, the disadvantage of RFAC over more conventional methods was its relatively high cost, largely driven by a thick film hybrid circuit used to switch the primary of the transformer. Recently, through a licensing agreement, this technology has been transferred to the U. S. and significant cost reductions and performance improvements have been achieved by the introduction of analog integrated circuits. An integrated circuit performs the following functions: (1) Chops the DC input to a signal suitable for driving the primary of the transformer; (2) Verifies the input voltage is above a threshold; (3) Verifies the input voltage is valid for a pre set time before enabling the device; (4) Provides thermal protection of the circuit; and (5) Provides an external input for independent logic level enabling of the power transfer mechanism. This paper describes the new RFAC product and its applications...|$|R
40|$|EP 401575, Issue C, {{calls out}} a {{requirement}} to perform safety studies for testers {{that are used}} to accept Joint Test Assembly (JTA) product at Pantex (Reference 1). The underlying motivation is to ensure that personnel hazards due to inadvertent initiation of <b>electro-explosive</b> <b>devices</b> (EEDs) during JTA testing are understood and minimized. Studies have been performed on the B 61 - 7 / 11 JTA, B 61 - 3 / 4 / 10 JTA, B 83 JTA, and W 76 Type 2 F testers at Pantex (References 2 - 5). Each of these studies includes an examination of the relevant Pantex tester as well as the instrumentation and War Reserve (WR) hardware. In performing these analyses, several themes have emerged that could be useful for the Phase 6. 3 design efforts for the weapons, the associated instrumentation, and the JTA testers. This report summarizes the lessons learned from these studies. Note that in some cases, the recommendations provided below to enhance safety during JTA testing operations (e. g., adding isolation resistors in the monitoring lines) may result in a reliability degradation or other surety impact. Thus {{it is important to consider}} these lessons learned in the context of the overall design and to make tradeoffs in light of the integrated surety objectives. The lessons learned are listed in five different categories, summarized as: (1) Instrumentation considerations; (2) WR design considerations; (3) Tester considerations; (4) Administrative procedures during JTA assembly; and (5) Administrative procedures prior to and during JTA testing. The first three focus on minimizing the probability of inadvertent application of power to EED initiation lines due to component, connector, and assembly failures. The last two describe procedural steps that can be taken at Pantex to either minimize the risk (e. g., by ensuring that tester power supplies cannot supply excessive power to the unit under test) or to mitigate the consequences of unexpected EED initiation (e. g., by instructing test operators to avoid standing in areas where they could be at risk in the event of EED initiation) ...|$|R
