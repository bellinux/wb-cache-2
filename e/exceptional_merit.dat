25|$|On October 8, 1941, {{he taught}} his last class; {{on the night}} of the 17th the GFP secret police arrested him in Brussels. He was extradited to Germany in January 1942 for what became thirty months in various prisons and {{concentration}} camps. A Japanese colleague, ornithologist Hatchisuka Masauji (who had accompanied him on one of his trips to Congo), used his influence with Emperor Hirohito to persuade the Germans to spare Derscheid's life. When the Nazi government recognized that it was losing the war, Jean-Marie Derscheid was decapitated on March 13, 1944, in Brandenburg-Görden Prison under the orders of Heinrich Himmler. Posthumously, he was granted the Political Prisoner Cross 1940-1945 and named Lieutenant in the S.R.A. He was recognized in citations by the President of the United States and from King George VI for the <b>exceptional</b> <b>merit</b> of his service.|$|E

His year at this highest level of professional military education was very fulfilling. He spent time {{in the school library}} and the Library of Congress. [...] He wrote his staff memorandum (equivalent to a thesis) on the subject of Army transportation. Recalling his personal experience with horses and mules in France, he recommended that motorized transport significantly replace the Army's use of livestock. The commandant of the school commended Middleton for work of <b>exceptional</b> <b>merit,</b> and sent his ideas to the highest levels in the War Department.|$|E

2500|$|The Cross of Honour of the German Mother (...) , {{referred}} to colloquially as the Mutterehrenkreuz (Mother’s Cross of Honour) or simply Mutterkreuz (Mother’s Cross), {{was a state}} decoration conferred {{by the government of}} the German Reich to honour a Reichsdeutsche German mother for <b>exceptional</b> <b>merit</b> to the German nation. Eligibility later extended to include Volksdeutsche (ethnic German) mothers from, for example, Austria and Sudetenland, that had earlier been incorporated into the German Reich.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, the ALA {{founded the}} first lesbian, gay, {{bisexual}} and transgender professional organization, called the [...] "Task Force on Gay Liberation", {{now known as}} the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table or GLBT Round Table. The first leader was Israel David Fishman. Barbara Gittings became its coordinator in 1971. In the early 1970s, the Task Force on Gay Liberation campaigned to have books about the gay liberation movement at the Library of Congress reclassified from HQ 71–471 (“Abnormal Sexual Relations, Including Sexual Crimes”). In 1972, after receiving a letter requesting the reclassification, the Library of Congress agreed to make the shift, reclassifying those books into a newly created category, HQ 76.5 (“Homosexuality, Lesbianism—Gay Liberation Movement, Homophile Movement”). In 1971 the GLBTRT created the first award for GLBT books, the Stonewall Book Award, which celebrates books of <b>exceptional</b> <b>merit</b> that relate to LGBT issues. Patience and Sarah by Alma Routsong (pen name Isabel Miller) was the first winner. In 1992, American Libraries published a photo of the GLBTRT (then called the Gay and Lesbian Task Force) on the cover of its July/August issue, drawing both criticism and praise from the library world. Some commenters called the cover “in poor taste” and accused American Libraries of “glorifying homosexuality,” while others were supportive of the move. Christine Williams, who wrote an essay about the controversy surrounding the cover, concluded that in the mid-90s, the library world was “not an especially welcoming place to gays and lesbians." [...] In 2010, the GLBTRT announced a new committee, the Over the Rainbow Committee. This committee annually compiles a bibliography of books that show the GLBT community in a favorable light and reflects the interests of adults. The bibliographies provide guidance to libraries in the selection of positive GLBT materials.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sovereign}} {{is responsible}} for rendering justice for all her subjects, and is thus traditionally deemed the fount of justice. However, neither she nor her viceroys personally rule in judicial cases; instead the judicial functions of the Royal Prerogative are performed in trust and in the Queen's name by officers of Her Majesty's court, as {{is done in the}} federal jurisdiction. As the judges and courts are the sovereign's judges and courts, and as all law in Canada derives from the Crown, the monarch stands to give legitimacy to courts of justice and is the source of their judicial authority. An image of the Queen and/or her relevant provincial coat of arms is always displayed in provincial courtrooms, except in British Columbia and Newfoundland and Labrador, where the sovereign's arms for the United Kingdom are displayed. Itinerant judges will display an image of the Queen and the provincial flag when holding a session away from established courtrooms; such situations occur in parts of Canada where the stakeholders in a given court case are too isolated geographically to be able to travel for regular proceedings. Further, the superior courts of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and New Brunswick are called Her Majesty's Court of Queen's Bench of [...] (summarised as Queen's Bench), and the law in British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Saskatchewan allows for the lieutenant governor to appoint prominent lawyers as Queen's Counsel, a predominantly honorary title recognising <b>exceptional</b> <b>merit</b> and contribution to the legal profession. The Manitoba government of New Democratic Party leader Gary Doer changed in 2001 the designation of Queen's Counsel to Senior Counsel, doing so against the opinion of the Benchers of the Law Society of Manitoba.|$|E

Flora had not {{the same effect on}} one, though he {{suspected}} there was a depth of tenderness in her, behind the barrier. It struck him as a pity that she showed no signs of interest in West, who of late seemed to have been attracted by the pretty daughter of a storekeeper at the settlement; but, after all, the lad was hardly old or serious enough for Flora. There was, however, nobody else in the district who was nearly good enough for her; and George felt glad that she was reserved and critical. It would be disagreeable to contemplate her yielding to any suitor unless he were a man of <b>exceptional</b> <b>merit.</b>|$|E

60|$|That {{she must}} have been a lady of <b>exceptional</b> <b>merit</b> one felt convinced. The Signora, who had met her only once, and then under {{somewhat}} trying conditions, spoke her praises with equal enthusiasm. Had she, the Signora, enjoyed the advantage of meeting such a model earlier, she, the Signora, might have been a better woman. It seemed a pity the introduction could not have taken place sooner and under different circumstances. Could they both have adopted her as a sort of mutual mother-in-law, it would have given them, I am positive, the greatest satisfaction. On her occasional visits they would have vied with each other in showing her affectionate attention. For the deserted lady I tried to feel sorry, but could not avoid the reflection {{that it would have been}} better for all parties had she been less patient and forgiving. Her husband was evidently much more suited to the Signora.|$|E
60|$|He who has {{improved}} upon previous conceptions, and {{been the only}} one to make any very important advance in the science since Mill’s day, is J. E. Cairnes,(47) in his “Leading Principles of Political Economy newly expounded” (1874). Scarcely any previous writer has equaled him in logical clearness, originality, insight into economic phenomena, and lucidity of style. He subjected value, supply and demand, cost of production, and international trade, to a rigid investigation, which has given us actual additions to our knowledge of the study. The wages-fund theory was re-examined, and was stated in a new form, although Mr. Mill had given it up. Cairnes undoubtedly has given it its best statement. His argument on free trade (Part III, chapter iv) is the ablest and strongest to be found in modern writers. This volume is, however, not a systematic treatise on all the principles of political economy; but no student can properly pass by these great additions for the right understanding of the science. His “Logical Method of Political Economy” (1875) is a clear and able statement of the process to be adopted in an economic investigation, and is a book of <b>exceptional</b> <b>merit</b> and usefulness, especially in view of the rising differences in the minds of economists as to method.|$|E
60|$|The work of Adam Smith {{was soon}} known to other countries, apart from translations. A most lucid and {{attractive}} exposition {{was given to}} the French by J. B. Say, “Traité d’économie politique” (1803), followed, after lecturing in Paris from 1815-1830, by a more complete treatise,(37) “Cours complète d’économie politique” (1828). While not contributing much that was new, Say did a great service by popularizing previous results in a happy and lively style, combined with good arrangement, and many illustrations. The theory that general demand and supply are identical is his most important contribution to the study. Although he translated Ricardo’s book, he did not grasp the fact that rent did not enter into price. Say’s work was later supplemented by an Italian, Pellegrino Rossi,(38) who, in his “Cours d’économie politique” (1843-1851), naturalized the doctrines of Malthus and Ricardo on French soil. His work is of solid value, and he and Say have given rise to an active school of political economy in France. In Switzerland, Sismondi expounded Adam Smith’s results in his “De la richesse commerciale” (1803), but was soon led into a new position, explained in his “Nouveaux principes d’économie politique” (1819). This has made him the earliest and most distinguished of the humanitarian economists. Seeing the sufferings caused by readjustments of industries after the peace, and the warehouses filled with unsold goods, he thought the excess of production over the power of consumption was permanent, and attacked division of labor, labor-saving machinery, and competition. Discoveries which would supersede labor he feared would continue, and the abolition of patents, together with the limitation of population,(39) was urged. These arguments furnished excellent weapons to the socialistic agitators. Heinrich Storch(40) aimed to spread the views of Adam Smith(41) in Russia, by his “Cours d’économie politique” (1815). Without further developing the theory of political economy, he produced a book of <b>exceptional</b> <b>merit</b> by pointing out the application of the principles to Russia, particularly in regard to the effect of a progress of wealth on agriculture and manufactures; to the natural steps by which a new country changes from agriculture to a manufacturing régime; and to finance and currency, with an account of Russian depreciated paper since Catharine II.|$|E
