In the captain's quarters, Bonny shows Jimmy, who has identified himself as Captain Hook, a magical mineral dust that comes from the fairy-like alien race (called [...] "tree spirits" [...] by the pirates and Indians) that live on the island. The dust gives the power of flight, but she only has a small vial and does not have the knowledge of how to properly use it. She further explains that the tree spirit colony lies in a forest beyond the mountain range and the only passages are protected by a lost Kaw tribe. Jimmy agrees to help the pirates get to the tree spirits in the hopes of mining the magical mineral for himself.|$|R
