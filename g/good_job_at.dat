25|$|Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry {{stated that}} he {{expected}} Clinton to face some tough questions, but {{thought she was going}} to do a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>at</b> (being Secretary of State). Christopher Hitchens of Vanity Fair called her nomination a ludicrous embarrassment on the edition of November 18, 2008 of Hardball due to the Clintons' overseas connections, her actions during the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary. Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) voted against a unanimous voice approval, citing ethical concerns. He sought not to block the nomination through a filibuster, but to voice his opposition to her policies. Senator David Vitter (R-Louisiana) also voted against Clinton in Committee citing her husband's foreign donations for his non-profit entities.|$|E

Some critics praised Wolfman's writing, {{while others}} {{said that although}} the setting was a good comic book incentive and a good prequel for the video game series, the story did not make sense. Sorrentino's interior artwork was criticized for being [...] "muddy" [...] by critics, but some did praise it for being distinctive and did a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>at</b> setting the tone and atmosphere.|$|E

Towards the end of the year, she competed in a qualifying race for the 1990 Commonwealth Games on a hilly course that [...] "suited [...] perfectly" [...] after her hill training. She finished half a length after Madonna Harris, which secured her a place in the New Zealand team.

500|$|Not all reviews were so critical. Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed {{awarded the}} episode 4 out of 5 stars. Although {{he noted that}} the episode was [...] "not Gilligan's best work" [...] and that the writing was [...] "a little spotty", he said [...] "the vibe [...] is very well done." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a {{moderately}} positive review, writing [...] "My heart wasn't racing and I wasn't {{sitting on the edge of}} my seat as Mulder and Scully unmasked our two magicians [...] But it was fun to put the clues together to see what it all added up to." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and wrote that he [...] "love it". He praised the episode's [...] "good-naturedness", which he felt was due to Mulder and Scully's interaction. Handlen also enjoyed the writing, noting that the [...] "script also does a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>at</b> doling out its secrets in a way that never makes either the magicians or our heroes come off as idiots". Paul Spragg of Xposé wrote positively of the episode, describing it as a [...] "rather fun tale".|$|E

We need Congress and the White House to focus on creating the millions of <b>good</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>at</b> home that we so desperately need—not passing more flawed trade deals.

500|$|Critics {{enjoyed the}} game's visuals. Entertainment Weekly Adam B. Vary thought the game did a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>at</b> recreating {{the look and}} feel of the {{original}} manga. Walter called the game's visuals [...] "gorgeous" [...] and [...] "striking", and thought that they were what would get people from places where the manga had not yet become popular interested in the game. Eurogamer Tom Bramwell described the visuals as distinctive, and at times reminiscent of Jet Set Radio. Smith called GioGio's Bizarre Adventure among the most faithful manga-to-video game adaptations he had seen, praising the 3D recreation of the manga's artwork, and said that its use of effects such as speed lines and visual katakana sound effects made it feel familiar. He noted that the environments looked [...] "a little crude" [...] and with blurry textures if one looked at details up close, but that they looked impressive from a distance. Reviewers at Famitsu also enjoyed how the game reproduced the look of the manga in 3D, but noted that the presentation of the story felt insufficient for people who have not read the Vento Aureo manga, and that it seemed mostly targeted towards people who already were fans of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.|$|E
500|$|Mike Fahey, {{writing for}} Kotaku, called the game brilliant, and {{compared}} the gameplay, graphics and music favorably to their Metroid II counterparts. Siliconera Ishaan found the game impressive, {{and said that}} it stands out from other fan-made remakes. Sam Machkovech at Ars Technica said that the game would be a delight to people who liked Zero Mission, and that its quality and amount of polish put it on par with Nintendo's games. Zack Furniss of Destructoid liked the game {{to the point that}} he thought Nintendo should use some ideas from it in future Metroid titles. Jonathan Holmes, also at Destructoid, said that AM2R does a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>at</b> filling the [...] "void" [...] left by Nintendo's lack of new 2D Metroid games, calling it [...] "even more of an extensive re-imagining than Metroid: Zero Mission was to Metroid 1". Gonçalo Lopes at Nintendo Life said that the game was a great way to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary and a dream come true for Metroid fans, and that he imagined people {{would be willing to pay}} money for it if sold on Nintendo's eShop. Matthew Castle at Nintendo Gamer called it an example of how to do a remake right. Tom Sykes at PC Gamer praised AM2R as a [...] "great game in its own right" [...] regardless of whether one had played Metroid II prior or not. NF Magazine Tony Ponce initially worried that the game would lose the [...] "eerie charm" [...] of Metroid II, but found it to be able to keep a high-tension feeling, as well as including new things for longtime fans of the original.|$|E
500|$|On Metacritic, {{the season}} scored 59 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, {{indicating}} [...] "mixed or average reviews". The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 69% approval rating {{with an average}} rating of 6.8/10 based on 13 reviews. The website's consensus reads, [...] "Despite some too-hip dialogue and familiar thematic elements, Supernaturals vigilante brothers manage to stir up some legitimate scares." [...] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly gave the first season a B, saying the show [...] "comes off as weekly installments of a horror movie series", but that [...] "Adding to the show's cred are the '67 Chevy Impala the boys rumble around in and their kick-ass soundtrack". Tom Gliatto of People Weekly ranked the show at number five on his list of the Best TV Shows of 2005. Peter Schorn of IGN gave the season a score of 7 out of 10. While he found the self-enclosed episodes to be [...] "passably entertaining", he enjoyed the story arcs introduced later in the season. Schorn also deemed the [...] "stormy relationship between Sam and his father" [...] to be [...] "compelling", and noted that the lead stars have [...] "good chemistry together". Rick Porter of Zap2it felt that while the season had its [...] "share of emotional moments", it also [...] " [...] the pants off" [...] of viewers [...] "surprisingly well". He also believed that it did a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>at</b> balancing mythology episodes with self-enclosed ones, comparing it to the early seasons of The X-Files. However, Eric Neigher of Slant Magazine highly criticized the self-enclosed episodes for being [...] "almost totally linear, without any B- or C-stories", and felt that the episodes were mainly [...] "watered-down rehashes of classic weird fiction or popular urban legends".|$|E

2500|$|Michael McWhertor of Polygon {{scored the}} game a 9 out of 10. He {{thought that the}} story was [...] "intriguing", said the guns were [...] "unlike any other video game gun", in that the Visceral attacks give the player [...] "one of the best {{feelings}} in any game", praised the game's difficulty for providing satisfying encounters, and thought the cryptic mysteries did a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>at</b> encouraging the player to progress through the game. He also praised the game's environments, enemies, and weapons, as {{he thought they were}} well designed and offered the player freedom and variety. McWhertor's main criticisms were concerning the load times and technical issues. He found that the game performed noticeably worse when playing with another player, saying that the frame rate [...] "takes a hit". He also found some mechanics and items confusing, and disliked {{the fact that there are}} lots of loading screens in quick succession.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} an equilibrium search model with on-the-job search where Þrms set wages. If employers are perfectly {{aware of all}} workers job opportunities, then when an employee receives an outside job offer, it is optimal for their employer to try to retain them by matching the offer, {{so long as the}} resulting wage doesnt exceed the worker. s productivity. A Bertrand competition is thus triggered between the incumbent employer and the. poacher., which results in a wage increase for the worker. However, if workers are able to vary their search intensity, then this offer-matching policy runs into a moral hazard problem. Knowing that outside offers lead to wage increases, workers are induced to search more intensively, which is costly for the Þrms. Assuming that Þrms can commit never to match outside offers, we examine the set of Þrm types for which it is preferable to do so. We derive sufficient conditions for the equilibrium to be of the sort all Þrms match or no Þrm matches. Finally, computed examples show that, even though virtually any situation can be observed in equilibrium when the sufficient conditions are not met, a plausible pattern is one where a dual labor market emerges, with bad <b>jobs</b> <b>at</b> low-porductivity, nomatching arms and <b>good</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>at</b> high-poductiviy, matching arms...|$|R
