Fifty patients fulfilled the study criteria. There was a strong correlation between the presence of C pyloridis and histologically confirmed gastritis. Clearance of organisms led to improvement of the gastritis. C pyloridis was cleared from 15 patients; of these, 13 had gastritis initially, which resolved in 12. Conversely, gastritis resolved in only four of 32 patients not cleared of organisms (p less than 0. 0001).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to propose an {{empirical}} solution to the problem of how many clusters of complex samples should be selected to construct the training set for a universal near infrared quantitative model based on the Næs method. The sample spectra were hierarchically classified into clusters by Ward’s algorithm and Euclidean distance. If the sample spectra were classified into two clusters, the 1 / 50 of the largest Heterogeneity value in the cluster with larger variation was set as the threshold to determine the total number of clusters. One sample was then randomly selected from each cluster to construct the training set, and the number of samples in training set equaled the number of clusters. In this study, 98 batches of rifampicin capsules with API contents ranging from 50. 1 % to 99. 4 % were studied with this strategy. The root mean square errors of cross validation and prediction were 2. 54 % and 2. 31 % for the model for rifampicin capsules, respectively.

Worldwide clinical studies to evaluate its efficacy and safety {{in the treatment of}} infections of the lower respiratory tract have achieved a clinical success rate of 89 % with few and mild side effects. Double-blind studies comparing roxithromycin with cephradine, erythromycin <b>ethylsuccinate</b> and doxycycline in pneumonia, acute exacerbations of bronchitis in patients with chronic obstructive airways disease, and acute bronchitis have been done. The clinical response to comparative regimens has been similar and ranges from 60 % response with either regimen in patients with chronic airways disease to 90 % response in patients with acute bronchitis or pneumonia. Roxithromycin appears to be as effective as erythromycin or doxycycline for the treatment of either Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae infections. A large double-blind trial comparing cephradine and roxithromycin in 90 cases of bacteriologically confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia in South African gold miners resulted in a 93 % and 100 % respective clinical response rate. Trie bacteriological results revealed interesting results in this same study, in that cultures from 17 % of patients receiving roxithromycin and 23 % of those receiving cephradine remained positive for S. pneumoniae afieT therapy was finished and an excellent clinical response had been obtained. Side effects in all studies have been transient and mild, with an elevated transaminase value being the most common in both roxithromycin and erythromycin or cephradine regimens. Roxithromycin appears to be a safe and effective oral antibiotic for the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia and other infections of the lower respiratory tract, and is as effective as erythromycin, doxycycline or cephradine...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Enhanced MR {{laboratory}} at HMRI {{is at the}} forefront of hyperpolarizing 13 C sodium succinate [1, 2] and its derivatives like <b>ethylsuccinate</b> by PASADENA method of hyperpolarization. Succinate can be now be hyperpolarized at over 20 % level of polarization routinely and reproducibly [3, 4]. Succinate is biomedically interesting as it can potentially assess the in vivo activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), the enzyme that was recently tagged as an oncogene due to its crucial role in cell energetics [5]. Purpose: The goal of research is to apply hyperpolarized succinate for imaging cancer in different tumor models in mice. Methods: We utilized PASADENA to hyperpolarize 1 - 13 C-succinate-d 2 at pH= 10 in a home-built polarizer and the hyperpolarized solution is injected via the tail vein of a BALB/c mouse bearing a Colon 26 tumor (N= 5). A home made 1 H/ 13 C dual resonance two turn loop coil and a 1 H/ 13 C dual resonance Litz volume coil (Doty Scientific, Inc., Columbia, SC) are utilized for 13 C hyperpolarized in vivo imaging and spectroscopy. Gradient echo and simple pulse and acquire sequences are used for hyperpolarized imaging and spectroscopy at Bruker Avance 4. 7 T animal scanner at HMRI. Results: We have demonstrated that succinate is delivered to the tumor (Colon- 26) of a mouse by tail vein injection (Fig. left). A 13 C image was acquired with a large flip angle (40 °) every 3. 5 seconds with polarization re-supplied by inflowing blood. The hyperpolarized succinate signal from the inflowing blood allowed for imaging up to 1 minute after injection. The 2 -D 13 C image acquired was five 3. 2 mm slices, 32 x 32 matrix, with an in-plane resolution of 1. 9 mm. Proton images of the tumor verified tha...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the comparative efficacy of enteral cisapride, metoclopramide, erythromycin, and placebo for promoting gastric emptying in critically ill patients with intolerance to gastric enteral nutrition (EN). Design: A randomized, crossover study. Setting: Adult medical {{intensive care unit}} at a university-affiliated private hospital and trauma intensive care unit at a university teaching hospital. Patients: Ten adult, critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients not tolerating a fiber-containing EN product defined as a single aspirated gastric residual volume 3 ̆e 150 mL or two aspirated gastric residual volumes 3 ̆e 120 mL during a 12 -hr period. Interventions: Patients received 10 mg of cisapride, 200 mg of erythromycin <b>ethylsuccinate,</b> 10 mg of metoclopramide, and placebo as 20 mL of sterile water every 12 hrs over 48 hrs. Acetaminophen solution (1000 mg) was administered concurrently. Gastric residual volumes were assessed, and plasma acetaminophen concentrations were serially determined by TDx between 0 and 12 hrs to evaluate gastric emptying. Measurements and Main Results: Gastric residual volumes during the study {{were not significantly different}} between agents. No differences in area under the concentration vs. time curve or elimination rate constant were identified between agents. Metoclopramide and cisapride had a significantly shorter mean residence time of absorption than erythromycin (6. 3 ± 4. 5 [SEM] mins and 10. 9 ± 5. 8 vs. 30. 1 ± 4. 5 mins, respectively [p 3 ̆c. 05]). Metoclopramide (9. 7 ± 15. 3 mins) had a significantly shorter time to peak concentration compared with erythromycin and placebo (60. 7 ± 8. 1 and 50. 9 ± 13. 5 mins, respectively [p 3 ̆c. 05]). The time to onset of absorption was significantly shorter for metoclopramide vs. cisapride (5. 7 ± 4. 5 vs. 22. 9 ± 5. 7 mins [p 3 ̆c. 05]). Conclusion: In critically ill patients intolerant to EN, single enteral doses of metoclopramide or cisapride are effective for promoting gastric emptying in critically ill patients with gastric motility dysfunction. Additionally, metoclopramide may provide a quicker onset than cisapride...|$|E
40|$|International audienceExtracellular {{polymeric}} substances (EPS) are, along with microbial cells, {{the main components}} of the biological sludges used in wastewater treatment and natural biofilms. EPS {{play a major role in}} removing pollutants from water by means of sorption. The ability of soluble EPS (S-EPS) and bound EPS (B-EPS) derived from various bacterial aggregates (flocs, granules, biofilms) to bind at pH 7. 0 ± 0. 1 to two pharmaceutical substances, acetaminophen (ACE) and erythromycin <b>ethylsuccinate</b> (ERY), has been investigated using the fluorescence quenching method. Two intense fluorescence peaks, A (Ex/Em range, 200 - 250 / 275 - 380 nm) and B (Ex/Em range, 260 - 320 / 275 - 360 nm), corresponding respectively to the aromatic protein region and soluble microbial by-product-like region, were identified in a three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix of EPS samples. The fluorescence peak, which corresponds to humic-like substances, was also identified though at low intensity. The ability of EPS to bind ACE was found to exceed that for ERY. The aromatic protein fraction of EPS displays a slightly higher affinity for drugs than that shown by the soluble microbial by-product-like fraction. The S-EPS and B-EPS present the same affinity for ACE and ERY. The effective quenching constants (log K) derived from the Stern-Volmer Equation equaled at peak A (with S-EPS) : 3. 7 ± 0. 2 to 4. 0 ± 0. 1 for ACE and 2. 1 ± 0. 3 to 2. 7 ± 0. 1 for ERY. With B-EPS, these values were 3. 9 ± 0. 1 to 4. 0 ± 0. 1 for ACE and 2. 0 ± 0. 2 to 2. 6 ± 0. 1 for ERY. Our results suggest that the weaker EPS affinity for ERY than for ACE serves to partially explain why only about 50 - 80 % of ERY is removed from wastewater at the treatment plant. Moreover, this work demonstrates that EPS from natural river biofilms are able to bind drugs, which in turn may limit the mobility of drugs in natural waters...|$|E
40|$|Erythromycin, a {{macrolide}} antibiotic {{isolated from}} Streptomyces erythreus, {{was first introduced}} into clinical medicine in 1952. It is active against most gram-positive bacteria, some gram-negative bacteria and is currently the agent of choice for Legionella pneumophila. Erythromycin is an acid-labile compound rapidly degrading in acidic solutions such as the acid environment of the stomach. As such, erythromycin absorption following oral administration of solid dosage forms is relatively poor. Accordingly there have been various approaches used to protect the drug against gastric inactivation. These precautions include enteric-coating of tablets, capsules or pellets of erythromycin base, the synthesis of acid stable 2 ' esters of erythromycin (<b>ethylsuccinate</b> and propionate) and salts of these esters (erythromycin estolate), and more recently, the synthesis {{of a range of}} new acid-stable, semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotics. The 2 ' esters are antimicrobially inactive or much less active than the parent compound and must be converted to the free erythromycin base in vivo in order to exhibit antibacterial activity. Intrinsic dissolution rates determined on raw material can provide extremely useful information relating to the gastrointestinal absorption of drugs from solid dosage forms. The large inter- and intrasubject variability associated with erythromycin base has, to date, mainly been attributed to gastric acid inactivation of the drug. However, changes in duodenal pH resulting in altered solubility and intrinsic dissolution rates may account for the observed variability. Thus, the intrinsic dissolution rates of erythromycin base at pH 6. 0, 6. 5, 7. 0, 7. 5 and 8. 0 were compared in order to investigate the possible effects of pH changes which may occur in the duodenal contents, on the in vivo dissolution and subsequent absorption of this compound. The standard intrinsic dissolution rate test procedure employing a rotating disc of pure erythromycin base powder which only allows for dissolution from a constant surface area, was adapted and the drug quantitatively determined by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using ultraviolet detection. Results of intrinsic dissolution studies at both 22 °C and 37 °C indicate that the solubility, and therefore the rate of dissolution of erythromycin base is pH dependent, being more soluble at pH 6. 0 than pH 8. 0 (an approximate 800 times and 1000 times reduction in the amount dissolved after 30 minutes, at 22 °C and 37 °C respectively, when the pH of the medium was increased from 6 to 8). Although the stability of erythromycin and its ester derivatives in aqueous acidic solutions has been well documented, very little has been reported on the compound's stability in organic solvents. Methanol is recommended by official drug compendia (U. S. P. and B. P.) for use in erythromycin identification tests {{as well as in the}} sample preparation steps during assay procedures. Thus, the effect of methanol and acetonitrile, organic solvents of similar polarities and densities, on the stability of erythromycin base, erythromycin <b>ethylsuccinate,</b> propionyl erythromycin and erythromycin estolate at room temperature (22 °C ± 0. 5 °C), using HPLC with electrochemical detection, was investigated. Erythromycin base is relatively stable in both methanol and acetonitrile, remaining intact for over 168 hours in acetonitrile and showing less than 5 % degradation in methanol over the same period. Erythromycin <b>ethylsuccinate</b> in acetonitrile shows less than 5 % degradation over 168 hours whereas in methanol, rapid hydrolysis occurs resulting in almost total conversion to base within 40 hours. Approximately 87 % of erythromycin propionyl ester remained intact after 168 hours in acetonitrile whilst methanol caused rapid hydrolysis to erythromycin base (35 % remaining after 28 hours). Erythromycin estolate appeared to be unstable in both acetonitrile and methanol. In acetonitrile, only 13 % of the estolate remained intact after 168 hours, whereas in methanol, the reaction was much more rapid with 35 % of the estolate remaining after 28 hours. The use of methanol as a solvent for erythromycin estolate reference standards is thus contraindicated. A number of conflicting reports on the half- life as well as the body compartment model that best describes erythromycin base serum concentration-time profiles (lBCM generally used to describe orally administered erythromycin, whilst a 2 BCM has been used to describe erythromycin administered intravenously), appear in the literature. These differences may be largely attributed to the sampling period (between 6 and 12 hours) used in the repective studies. The objective of this study was to determine the body compartment model that best describes erythromycin base serum concentration-time curves by increasing the sampling time to 24 hours. In addition, the effect of chronic dosing of erythromycin on erythromycin pharmacokinetics, in the same group of subjects, was investigated. The single and multiple oral dose pharmacokinetics of erythromycin enteric coated base pellets within a gelatin capsule (250 mg), were studied in 6 healthy, normal volunteers (19. 5 ± 0. 76 years, 71. 5 ± 8. 18 kg, 180. 33 ± 5. 99 cm). Furthermore, steady state concentrations were predicted using the pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from the single dose study, and compared with those obtained in the multiple dose study. Plasma concentrations were determined using a sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method with electrochemical detection. For the single dose study, after a tlag of 2. 5 ± 0. 71 hr, Cmax (1. 12 ± 0. 47 μ/ml) was reached at a tmax of 4. 08 ± 0. 93 hr post dose, with serum concentrations ranging from 0. 31 - 1. 62 μ/ml. The half-life was found to be 5. 42 ± 1. 31 hr. On multiple dosing (250 mg six hourly), serum concentrations for the fifth, ninth and thirteenth dosing intervals ranged from 0. 67 - 2. 92 μ/ml, 1. 69 - 3. 65 μ/ml and 0. 61 - 3. 01 μ/ml, occurring at 3. 75 ± 0. 69 hr, 3. 17 ± 1. 03 hr and 3. 17 ± 1. 03 hr post dose with a Cmax of 1. 89 ± 0. 68 μ/ml, 2. 35 ± 0. 70 μ/ml and 1. 94 ± 0. 74 μ/ml, respectively. The area under the serum concentration- time curve for the single dose study (AUC₀₋∞) was 4. 67 ± 0. 88 hr. μ/ml, whilst the AUC₀₋τ. for the fifth, ninth and thirteenth dosing intervals of the multiple dose study were 5. 77 ± 1. 76 hr. μ/ml, 6. 46 ± 1. 33 hr. μ/ml and 5. 97 ± 2. 36 hr. μ/ml respectively, indicating an approximately 33 % increase in AUC on chronic dosing of erythromycin. The observed increase in AUC may be a result of increased bioavailability or a decrease in clearance on chronic dosing. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Erythromycin, a {{macrolide}} antibiotic, {{has similar}} antimicrobial spectrum to penicillin {{and it is}} widely used, especially {{in the treatment of}} patients who are allergic to penicillin. In this work, the application of a renewable silver-amalgam film electrode (Hg(Ag) FE) for the characterization and determination of erythromycin <b>ethylsuccinate</b> (EES), a widely used esterified form of this antibiotic, by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV) is presented. In the aqueous Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5. 0 - 9. 0) that served as the supporting electrolyte, one reduction peak of EES was observed in the investigated potential range between - 0. 75 V and - 1. 80 V vs SCE, with peak potential maxima ranging from - 1. 59 V to - 1. 70 V, which strongly depended on the applied pH, as did the peak shape. For the analytical purposes the pH of 7. 0 was selected, since in this electrolyte the EES peak was well-shaped and separated from the background current of the supporting electrolyte in both cases; in the direct cathodic SWV {{and in the case of}} square wave adsorptive stripping voltammetry (SW-AdSV). It was established, by the Ep-pH correlation, that protons strongly influenced the electrochemical reduction of EES. The CVs recorded between 0. 025 - 0. 50 V s− 1 at pH 7. 0 confirmed that the electrode reaction is adsorption-controlled. Based on the series of 1 H NMR measurements it is proved that the tertiary amino group of EES is mainly in its protonated form at pH 7. 0 which may lead, at appropriate accumulation potential and time, to the favored adsorption of the target ionic form of the analyte improving on such way the sensitivity of the SW-AdSV method. The optimized procedures resulted in stable SWV responses with good linear correlation in the EES concentration range from 4. 53 to 29. 8 μg mL− 1 (LOD = 1. 36 μg mL− 1), and from 0. 69 μg mL− 1 to 2. 44 μg mL− 1 (LOD 0. 21 μg mL− 1) in the case of optimized SW-AdSV. The relative standard deviation is below 1. 5 %. The reliability of the elaborated procedures and thus the accuracy of the obtained results were validated by comparing them with those obtained by means of HPLC-DAD measurements. The direct cathodic SWV method was successfully applied for the determination of EES in the pharmaceutical preparation Eritromicin®, while SW-AdSV was applied in the case of the spiked urine sample. In both cases, the standard addition method was used...|$|E
