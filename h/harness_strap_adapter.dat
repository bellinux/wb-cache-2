50|$|The need {{to ditch}} the set quickly, may not arise, and <b>harness</b> <b>straps</b> {{may not need}} a quick-release.|$|R
5000|$|One {{human is}} the [...] "Robo-Jockey," [...] {{controlling}} the robot's arms and torso while standing via an exosuit-like <b>harness</b> <b>strapped</b> {{to his or}} her back and arms.|$|R
60|$|For answer Zeb {{began to}} {{unfasten}} Jim's <b>harness,</b> <b>strap</b> by strap, and to buckle one piece to another {{until he had}} made a long leather strip that would reach to the ground.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a small}} water {{catchment}} sump and drain {{on the underside of}} the canister. Its cylinder pressure gauge is on a flexible metal tube and fits in a circular webbing pouch threaded on the waist <b>harness</b> <b>strap.</b>|$|R
50|$|The basic DIR {{configuration}} {{includes a}} single primary canister {{light at the}} diver's right hip and two reserve lights clipped to the chest D-rings and secured against the <b>harness</b> <b>straps</b> by rubber bands. Lights are optional for shallow open water diving.|$|R
50|$|First {{broadcast}} in June 2008, it depicts three flightless birds—a penguin, a chicken, and an emu—being taken hang-gliding (the chicken and the penguin are shown wearing <b>harnesses</b> <b>strapped</b> {{to the chest}} of the glider pilots; the emu's harness is suspended between two gliders).|$|R
5000|$|After Madonna had herself gowned, <b>harnessed,</b> <b>strapped</b> {{down and}} fully {{stripped}} to promote her album Erotica and her book Sex, O'Connor stole the spotlight with one {{photograph of a}} fully clothed man. But the other vilification that descended on O'Connor showed she had struck a nerve.|$|R
60|$|They {{took the}} horses {{in charge and}} passed with them across the road and through the break in the wire fence. At the barn they found the ranch owner {{in the act of}} making Jeff Jones a close {{prisoner}} by tying his hands and legs with odd bits of <b>harness</b> <b>straps.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Half-cheek: {{has only}} an upper or, more commonly, lower cheek, {{as opposed to}} both seen in a full cheek snaffle. Often used in racing, as there is less chance of the cheek being caught on the {{starting}} gate, or in driving as there is less chance of getting caught on <b>harness</b> <b>straps.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Harness: Should be [...] "sound, clean, and fit correctly". Harness, if {{more than}} one horse is used, should match, {{although}} different bits may be used. The overall harness should also match. Martingales other than false martingales are not permitted. <b>Harness</b> <b>straps</b> should not be buckled on the last hole, so that adjustment may be made should a piece of harness break.|$|R
60|$|We {{finally agreed}} that Tars Tarkas should return along the branch, leaving his longest leather <b>harness</b> <b>strap</b> with me, {{and that when}} the limb had risen to a height that would permit me to enter the cave I was to do so, and on Tars Tarkas' return I could then lower the strap and haul {{him up to the}} safety of the ledge.|$|R
60|$|I {{watched him}} until {{he had made the}} turn {{at the end of the}} {{building}} which carried him out of sight of the side of the prison that was to witness our dash for freedom. The moment his form disappeared I grasped Xodar and drew him to the top of the wall. Placing one end of my <b>harness</b> <b>strap</b> in his hands I lowered him quickly to the ground below. Then the boy grasped the strap and slid down to Xodar's side.|$|R
5000|$|Director Jon Stone, in the 1994 {{documentary}} The World of Jim Henson, {{revealed that}} the Big Bird costume actually {{did not have any}} openings that would allow the actor to see; a small television was strapped to the actor's chest to allow him to navigate. [...] The camera was set up for Spinney by technician Walt Rauffer, on the suggestion of director Bob Myhrum. Rauffer rigged the camera to a <b>harness</b> <b>strapped</b> to Spinney's chest; Spinney reported that they called the camera [...] "the electronic bra".|$|R
5000|$|Wickwire {{looked back}} at the fixed rope and saw Hoey's open {{climbing}} waist harness still attached via a jumar. He couldn't compute at first what had happened, but later realized that her <b>harness</b> <b>strap</b> had not held, because Hoey hadn't threaded [...] "the end of her belt back through the buckle (the only way to assure it would not come loose)". [...] Retracing the route down, Wickwire found one of her crampons, but her body was lost below in the mountain's bergschrund. After Hoey's death, the three remaining climbers of the expedition's first summit team turned back.|$|R
50|$|Liquid {{immersion}} {{provides a}} {{way to reduce the}} physical stress of G forces. Forces applied to fluids are distributed as omnidirectional pressures. Because liquids cannot be practically compressed, they do not change density under high acceleration such as performed in aerial maneuvers or space travel. A person immersed in liquid of the same density as tissue has acceleration forces distributed around the body, rather than applied at a single point such as a seat or <b>harness</b> <b>straps.</b> This principle is used in a new type of G-suit called the Libelle G-suit, which allows aircraft pilots to remain conscious and functioning at more than 10 G acceleration by surrounding them with water in a rigid suit.|$|R
50|$|Diving {{in a tank}} {{presents}} hazards, {{particularly in}} all water towers (EST) and ground tanks (GST) above 100000 gal. Divers require confined-space training and working at heights certification. In the USA commercial diving operations require at least one trained tender, a diver, and a supervisor. Surface-supplied air with two-way radio communications to the diver and a safety rope are preferred. The Occupational Safety & Health Administration regulation 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart T allows scuba with a rope for basic communications. The diver should be wearing a <b>harness,</b> <b>strapped</b> to a safety rope, so that {{in case of an}} emergency the dive tender can pull the diver up. Diving contractors always need to check the safety legislation appropriate to their local jurisdiction.|$|R
5000|$|These {{models were}} {{released}} in 1996, designed and specifically {{made for the}} surfing market. These models were the very first G-Shock watches to have a countdown timer. The countdown timers on these models were designed to count down for surfing competitions, some of the later models have a yacht timers, moon and tide graphs, so a surfer can {{keep track of the}} progress while competing on the water. Many of these models came equipped with a pair of <b>strap</b> <b>adapters</b> and a single one-piece resin or nylon band. These styles of band are also known as [...] "crossband" [...] in the Japanese domestic market. Resin bands for these models had open gaps or slits through the band. Casio refers to them as drainage slits; the idea is that water will drain out with no problems while in action when surfing. Most of these series models had a translucent band. These models were branded as X-Treme for the Japanese domestic market.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{level of}} damage {{imparted}} on {{three types of}} satellites components resulting from hypervelocity impacts of aluminum projectiles onto a neighboring structural part have been assessed experimentally by using a double stage light gas gun. The experimental configurations were designed to simulate debris encounters with a space vehicle during its operational life time around the Earth. The first test was conducted against a set of separate <b>harness</b> <b>strapped</b> down on the inner surface of a carbon facesheet sandwich panel {{in order to assess}} the effectiveness of redundant cables spacing in case of unitary debris perforating impact onto the structure. The resistance to damaging of a silicon carbide mirror and a solar panel was then evaluated against debris cloud generated by prior impact of chunky debris with the satellite structure. Potential losses of electrical functional capabilities were then derived. The vulnerability/Survivability Pléiades software was updated accordingly...|$|R
50|$|With up to 261 {{hours of}} standby time, the LG Shine offers SMS, EMS, MMS, and Email. Accessories include a travel <b>adapter,</b> <b>strap,</b> stereo {{headphones}} and inline remote/handsfree kit and a USB data kit.|$|R
50|$|Multiple {{evolutions}} from classical harness (Antiquity), {{to breast}} <b>strap</b> <b>harness</b> (6th century) to horse collar (9th century), allowed more horse pulling power, such as with heavy ploughs.|$|R
5000|$|A {{backplate}} is {{a structure}} onto which the back-mounted diving cylinders are mounted, usually linking the buoyancy compensator {{with the weight}} of the diving cylinders and provided with a <b>harness</b> of <b>straps</b> which secures the scuba set to the diver's back. A backplate is generally used with a back inflation (wing) type buoyancy compensator, but can also be used without any buoyancy compensator.|$|R
5000|$|The crupper {{consists}} of a loop (the crupper itself) and an adjustable strap (crupper strap or back strap) that connects the crupper to back of a riding saddle or {{the other parts of}} a <b>harness.</b> The <b>strap</b> runs from the horse's dock, over the croup, to the saddle or to the back band (sometimes called the saddle) of a harness.|$|R
25|$|A {{less common}} problem is found when rebreathers have a counterlung towards {{the top of}} the torso. In this case there may be a need to attach weights near the counterlung. This is usually not a problem, and weight pockets for this purpose are often built into the rebreather harness or casing, and if {{necessary}} weights can be attached to the <b>harness</b> shoulder <b>straps.</b>|$|R
25|$|Task-specific gait {{training}} {{may also}} lead to long-term gait improvement for patients with Parkinson's disease. Previous research studies have utilized body weight support systems during gait training, where individuals are suspended from an overhead <b>harness</b> with <b>straps</b> around the pelvic girdle as they walk on a treadmill. This form of gait training {{has been shown to}} improve long-term walking speed and a shuffling gait following a one-month intervention period.|$|R
5000|$|There are a {{great deal}} of die-hard, unfounded myths {{surrounding}} these decorations such as their usage as amulets to ward off the [...] "evil eye". The most popular size is 3 × 3½ inches of flat brass with a hanger by which the brass is threaded onto a horse <b>harness</b> <b>strap,</b> known as a Martingale. In England many of these items of harness found their way into country public houses as the era of the heavy horse declined, and are still associated today as a pub decoration. By the late 19th century heavy horses were decorated with brasses of all kinds and sizes. During this era working horse parades were popular throughout the British Isles and prize or merit awards were given, some by the Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA). Horse brasses were often highly prized by the [...] "carters", who decorated their horse with them. Other horse brass subjects include advertising, royalty commemoration, and in later years, souvenir brasses for places and events, many of which are still being made and used today.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{his already}} jewel-encrusted <b>harness,</b> to the <b>strap</b> that crossed his great chest beneath which beat his loyal heart, Carthoris, Prince of Helium, {{fastened}} the gleaming thing that Thuvia of Ptarth had worn, and wearing, had made holy to the Heliumite.|$|R
40|$|The {{harnessing}} {{guidelines for}} donkeys pulling a single donkey cart {{are based on}} practices from Europe which are adapted {{to the situation in}} many African countries. The basic principles remain the same, anatomy of the donkey and criteria for a donkey harness, but the concept is to make a comfortable harness from locally available materials. The most simple pulling device is opted for, the breast <b>strap</b> <b>harness.</b> Examples are given how to measure the size of the straps and how to make the breast <b>strap</b> <b>harness,</b> keeping in mind the necessary animal comfort. Cheap saddles and breaking devices are also described and a few examples of single donkey carts from Kenya and West Africa are included...|$|R
5000|$|The {{bodies were}} moved to the Gilbert's hotel and at 4pm Dr. Von Lossberg, the Government Medical Officer at Ipswich arrived and between 4-5pm began an autopsy. Michael had been shot and struck with a blunt {{instrument}} {{on the right side}} of the head. Theresa 'Ellen' had her skull fractured by two blows to the left side of her head. The wounds and position of the bodies when found indicated that Michael and Theresa 'Ellen' were sitting upright and back-to-back when struck. Norah had also been struck on the left side of her head, pulverising her skull to the extent that her brain was protruding. In addition, Norah had a <b>harness</b> <b>strap</b> tied around her neck, tight enough to have caused death. It is alleged that both women had been [...] "outraged" [...] (raped). In the absence of semen, based on the evidence of Sergeant Arrell that he found a pool of blood, which turned the soil to mud and stuck to the underside of the rug on which Nora's body was found, it appears that both women were raped with the brass-mounted handle of a whip. An extensive police search for the whip met with negative results.|$|R
25|$|Early scuba {{sets were}} usually {{provided}} with a plain <b>harness</b> of shoulder <b>straps</b> and waist belt. The waist belt buckles were usually quick-release, and shoulder straps sometimes had adjustable or quick release buckles. Many harnesses {{did not have a}} backplate, and the cylinders rested directly against the diver's back.|$|R
5000|$|Music {{historian}} James Fuld {{notes that}} [...] "the word jingle {{in the title}} and opening phrase is apparently an imperative verb." [...] In the winter in New England in pre-automobile days, it was common to adorn horses' <b>harnesses</b> with <b>straps</b> bearing bells {{as a way to}} avoid collisions at blind intersections, since a horse-drawn sleigh in snow makes almost no noise. The rhythm of the tune mimics that of a trotting horse's bells. However, [...] "jingle bells" [...] is commonly taken to mean a certain kind of bell.|$|R
50|$|Charlie T. Schieldt was a {{manufacturer}} of fine harnesses, saddles and bridles by 1884. He specialized in Single <b>Strap</b> <b>Harness,</b> but also produced collars, whips, blankets, oils, soaps, combs, brushes and fly nets. The company was located {{at the corner of}} James and Warren Streets at Lathrop Block. Schieldt lived at 51 Burnet Avenue.|$|R
5000|$|Man basket - a lift {{platform}} that slides onto the tines (forks) and is meant for hoisting workers. The man basket has railings {{to keep the}} person from falling and brackets for attaching a safety <b>harness.</b> Also, a <b>strap</b> or chain is used to attach the man basket to the carriage of the forklift.|$|R
500|$|... 0n 19 August 1940, Johnson flew a Spitfire for {{the first}} time. Over the next weeks he practised handling, {{formation}} flying, attacks, battle climbs, aerobatics and dogfighting. During his training flights, he stalled and crashed a Spitfire. Johnson had his <b>harness</b> <b>straps</b> on too loose, and wrenched his shoulders – revealing that his earlier rugby injury had not healed properly. The Spitfire did a ground loop, ripping {{off one of the}} undercarriage legs and forcing the other up through the port main plane. The commanding officer (CO) excused Johnson, for the [...] "short airfield" [...] was difficult to land on for an inexperienced pilot. Johnson got the impression, however, that he would be watched closely, and felt that if he made another mistake, he would be [...] "certainly washed out". Johnson tried to pack the injured shoulder with wool, held in place by adhesive tape. He also tightened the straps to reduce vibrations. Johnson found he had lost his [...] "feel" [...] in his right hand, and it became numb. When he practised dives, the pressure also aggravated his shoulder. He often tried to fly using his left hand only, but the Spitfire would have to be handled with both hands during anything other than simple manoeuvres. Despite the difficulties with his injuries, on 28 August 1940, the course was complete. Johnson had 205.25 hours on operational types including 23.50 on the Spitfire.|$|R
5000|$|The TVIS is a {{modified}} treadmill. It includes a vibration isolation system, which prevents the {{forces from the}} exercise from being transferred into the International Space Station (ISS). This device is used in a very similar manner to a regular treadmill. In order to hold the user {{to the surface of}} the treadmill, it includes a system of straps called the series bungee system (SBS) which use latex tubes or straps called [...] "subject load devices" [...] (SLDs) attached to a <b>harness.</b> These <b>straps</b> place resistive forces and loads in a range of 40 lb. to 220 lb. on the crew member's body as they walk or run on the treadmill.|$|R
2500|$|The crupper {{consists}} of a loop (the crupper itself) and an adjustable strap (crupper strap or back strap) that connects the crupper to back of a riding saddle or {{the other parts of}} a <b>harness.</b> [...] The <b>strap</b> runs from the horse's dock, over the croup, to the saddle or to the back band (sometimes called the saddle) of a harness.|$|R
5000|$|A {{common form}} of armbinder {{consists}} of a sheath, roughly conical, that encloses both of the wearer's arms from fingertips to above the elbow, holding them together behind the back, combined with one of various <b>harness</b> (<b>straps)</b> arrangements {{to hold it in}} place. The sheath is commonly of latex or leather which itself typically covers the arms from the fingertips to above the elbows, and is closed and tightened with a zipper, lacing, or sometimes both; the sheath is frequently supplemented with straps around the wrists and the elbows or upper arms. The sheath alone is ineffective without a harness to keep it from slipping down the arms; the most common harness is a pair of straps that join to the outer top of the sheath, run over the shoulders and under the armpits, and join again at the inner top of the sheath. The straps are usually crossed, behind the neck or across the upper chest, to prevent the straps from slipping off the shoulders. The latter position can cause problems if the straps tend to ride up and press on the wearer's throat. Left strap is brought from under left armpit, brought over right shoulder and then buckled up behind the neck [...] same is done with right strap and then both right and left strap are buckled together to prevent falling of armbinder. Due to this armbinder, elbows are kept in touch with {{each other for a long}} time which can cause injury if kept for a very long time.|$|R
