5|$|Several {{accidents}} occurred which {{threatened the}} station's safety, {{such as the}} glancing collision between Kristall and Soyuz TM-17 during proximity operations in January 1994. The three most alarming incidents occurred during EO-23. The first was on 23 February 1997 during the handover period from EO-22 to EO-23, when a malfunction occurred in the backup Vika system, a chemical oxygen generator later known as solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG). The Vika malfunction led to a fire which burned <b>for</b> <b>around</b> 90 seconds (according to official sources at the TsUP; astronaut Jerry Linenger insists the fire burned <b>for</b> <b>around</b> 14 minutes), and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station <b>for</b> <b>around</b> 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, {{but some of the}} respirator masks initially worn were broken. Some of the fire extinguishers mounted {{on the walls of the}} newer modules were immovable.|$|E
