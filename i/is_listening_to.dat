500|$|In his own words, Ocean {{calls the}} album [...] "nostalgic." [...] He explains, [...] "it's {{a longing for}} the past. That's what this record felt like." [...] The lyrical content, {{according}} to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to make a}} record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that I wanted to get off my chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener <b>is</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> you, so if you put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess it all starts with the stories for me." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} between his return from Paris in 1908 and the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914, Vaughan Williams increasingly established himself as a figure in British music. For a rising composer it was important to receive performances at the big provincial music festivals, which generated publicity and royalties. In 1910 his music featured at two {{of the largest and most}} prestigious festivals, with the premieres of the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis at the Three Choirs Festival in Gloucester Cathedral in September and A Sea Symphony at the Leeds Festival the following month. The leading British music critics of the time, J. A. Fuller Maitland of The Times and Samuel Langford of The Manchester Guardian, were strong in their praise. The former wrote of the fantasia, [...] "The work is wonderful because it seems to lift one into some unknown region of musical thought and feeling. Throughout its course one is never sure whether one <b>is</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> something very old or very new". Langford declared that the symphony [...] "definitely places a new figure in the first rank of our English composers". Between these successes and the start of war Vaughan Williams's largest-scale work was the first version of A London Symphony (1914). In the same year he wrote The Lark Ascending in its original form for violin and piano.|$|E

500|$|One of Swift's {{earliest}} musical memories <b>is</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing at church. As a child, {{she enjoyed}} Disney film soundtracks: [...] "My parents noticed that, once I {{had run out}} of words, I would just make up my own". Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child. She also attributes her [...] "fascination with writing and storytelling" [...] to her mother. Swift was drawn to the storytelling of country music, and was introduced to the genre by [...] "the great female country artists of the '90s"—Shania Twain, Faith Hill and the Dixie Chicks. Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence. Hill was Swift's childhood role model: [...] "Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it". She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments. The band's [...] "Cowboy Take Me Away" [...] was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar. Swift also explored the music of older country stars, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. She believes Parton is [...] "an amazing example to every female songwriter out there". Alt-country artists such as Ryan Adams, Patty Griffin and Lori McKenna have inspired Swift.|$|E
500|$|Produced by Madlib, [...] "The Healer" [...] is an ode to hip hop {{culture and}} a {{proclamation}} of its scope. It {{opens with a}} brief snippet from a song by Malcolm McLaren featuring the World's Famous Supreme Team. Frere-Jones notes [...] "bells, unidentifiable knocks, a lonesome instrument {{that might be a}} sitar, or a guitar, and lots of empty space" [...] in the musical backdrop, adding that [...] "the music flirts with total stasis, though it still has an audible beat." [...] Badu's lyrics, delivered in an incantation style, make reference to various names of God, including Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Jah, and Rastafari, while asserting hip hop to be [...] "bigger than" [...] social institutions such as religion and government. She explained the lyrics and religious references, saying [...] "to me, hip-hop is felt in all religions - it has a healing power. I've recently been to Palestine, Jerusalem, Africa and a bunch of other places, and everyone <b>is</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> hip-hop. There's something about that kicking snare sound that all kinds of people find meaning in." [...] The autobiographical song [...] "Me" [...] discusses Badu's thoughts and feelings about her life, including the struggle of growing as a public figure. She mocks others' perception of her, which she has explained as [...] "everything you can see of Erykah Badu — the Ankhs, the powers, the 5 Percenters, the mysteries, it’s all true. The lies; it’s all true. Had two babies with different daddies. Thirty-six years old and addicted to a variety of spending." [...] The song's jazz conclusion has Badu singing about her mother's life and resilience in unison with a muted trumpet.|$|E
