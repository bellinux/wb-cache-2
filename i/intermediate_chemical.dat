40|$|R 1121 An {{overview}} {{is given}} of zeolite effects on selected organic transformations in the condensed phase, {{with an emphasis}} on the production of fine and <b>intermediate</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Shape selectivity and zeolite polarity are the main phenomena under study. While the factors contributing to selectivity are not always easily distinguished, it is clear that true shape selectivity is essential in the transformation of many fine and <b>intermediate</b> <b>chemicals</b> over zeolites. New opportunities arise for zeolite catalysis in this domain by the advent of new zeolite structures, by the incorporation of new elements in the zeolite structures and by combination of zeolite catalysis and biocatalysis.
