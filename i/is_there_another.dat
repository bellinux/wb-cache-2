60|$|ADAM [returning] <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> {{voice in}} the garden besides our voices and the Voice? I heard a new voice.|$|E
60|$|Q. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> scripture proves it?--A. Yes; 'Then came she and worshiped him, saying, Lord, help me' (Matt 15:25).|$|E
60|$|Q. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> {{reason why}} I should pray?--A. Yes. For by prayer thou acknowledgest, that help {{is not in}} thine own power (2 Chron 20:6,12).|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come away,' he said, in {{a broken}} voice. 'We {{have no right}} to <b>be</b> <b>there.</b> <b>Another</b> stands before us--nearer to her than we!' ...|$|R
6000|$|But <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> way? And [...] "Tomorrow {{they will}} shoot him!" [...] She shuddered, bit {{her lower lip}} {{in an effort to}} command her courage, and then, wheeling, plunged into the thicket.|$|R
60|$|She {{could make}} neither head nor tail of it, nor <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> word {{to give a}} clue to its meaning, so at last from {{constant}} repetition it became a commonplace and she gave it no further thought.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Winifred! Yes, now for {{the first}} time, though I have called you Paul from the moment you entered the room. Well, speak out. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> woman that you love?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did you do this, M. Paul? Is {{this your}} house? Did you furnish it? Did {{you get these}} papers printed? Do you mean me? Am I the directress? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> Lucy Snowe? Tell me: say something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Terre aux Boeufs! What the dev--I {{beg your}} pardon, Madame la Vicomtesse, but {{you give me}} {{something}} of a surprise. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> conspiracy at Terre aux Boeufs, or--does somebody live there who has never before lent Auguste money?" ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the lower}} part of the wall outside the repository, where the {{belltower}} used to <b>be,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> marble inscription in Armenian. It reads: ...|$|R
50|$|Only {{after the}} Second World War <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> {{territorial}} reorganization. The Palatinate was now grouped into the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The Bürgermeisterei of Neunkirchen, though, remained in force until the 1968 administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate. After its dissolution, Föckelberg became an Ortsgemeinde within the Verbandsgemeinde of Altenglan.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no,' said Mr. Wickfield. 'Why {{should you}} <b>be</b> inconvenienced? <b>There's</b> <b>another</b> room. <b>There's</b> <b>another</b> room.' 'Oh, but you know,' {{returned}} Uriah, with a grin, 'I {{should really be}} delighted!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must ask}} you to pardon me," [...] {{continued}} Van Sweller, gracefully, [...] "for annoying you with questions, but some of your methods are a little new to me. Shall I don a full-dress suit with an immaculate white tie--or <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> tradition to be upset?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heavens and earth! Plantagenet;--who else? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> man in {{the world}} would come into his own house, among his own guests, and speak only to one person? And, then, think of it! Popularity is the staff on which alone Ministers can lean in this country with security." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He'll {{never get}} another half so good; and he'll {{be sure to}} get one before long. It is a sort of {{tenderness}} that is quite inefficacious. He will become a prey, as I should have made him a prey. But where <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> who will treat him so well?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did {{you know}} that when that terrible gun <b>was</b> fired <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> terrible gun right over behind those bushes?" [...] asked Blacky.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Sally!" [...] He almost {{leaped from}} the bed, but she <b>was</b> gone. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> rustle at the door--the {{entrance}} of Sophy.|$|R
50|$|The Swedish Army {{established}} {{its headquarters}} at Prenzlau. It <b>was</b> joined <b>there</b> <b>another</b> department, established in Swedish Bremen-Verden, under General Dalwig.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{have guessed}} as much," [...] he answered. [...] "And yet I must still call you by that name, seeing {{that you are}} the queen of all women, for say, where <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> so lovely, so brave, or so great? Here at least there are none," [...] and he bowed before her with a stately {{courtesy}} that would have become any European gentleman.|$|E
60|$|Hark! has a door unclosed? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> {{human being}} in the room? We have now become so {{accustomed}} to the dim medium that we distinguish a man of mean exterior, {{with a look of}} habitual subservience that seems like that of an English serving-man, or a person in some menial situation; decent, quiet, neat, softly-behaved, but yet with a certain hard and questionable presence, which we would not well like to have near us in the room.|$|E
6000|$|A salute {{of seven}} guns is fired. Mounted on a fine camel, which {{is led by}} a {{gigantic}} Nubian, and attended by perhaps two hundred horsemen in chain armour, the Khalifa rides on {{to the ground and}} along the ranks. It is a good muster. Few have dared absent themselves. Yet his brow is clouded. What has happened? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> revolt in the west? Do the Abyssinians threaten Gallabat? Have the black troops mutinied; or is it only some harem quarrel? ...|$|E
50|$|The vernal pool {{provides}} {{habitat for}} the rare and endangered Loch Lomond button celery (Eryngium constancei) (also called coyote-thistle and Constance's coyote-thistle). The button celery was first {{collected in the}} vernal pool in 1941, and not until the late 1990s <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> discovery at two other locations in Lake County and one location in Sonoma County.|$|R
60|$|But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> pole. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> the moon. And <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> {{absolute}} and visible principle, {{the principle of}} water. The moon is not water. But it is the soul of water, the invisible clue to all the waters.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the story}} of the Mockery Bird <b>is</b> fictitious, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> bird species thought to be extinct, and then re-discovered: the takahe from New Zealand.|$|R
6000|$|... "I t'ought ye 'd say that, when ye {{come to know}} me. Is it meself that 's a messenger? {{and where}} <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> that can carry news widout {{spilling}} any by the way? Nick's a cr'ature, I allows; but the majjor know'd a million times bhetter than to trust an Injin wid sich a jewty. As for Joel, and that set of vagabonds, we'll grind 'em all in the mill, before we've done wid 'em. Let 'em look for no favours, if they wishes no disapp'intment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't see ut that way," [...] said Long Jack, the peacemaker. [...] "Look at here, Disko! <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> packet afloat {{this day}} in this weather c'u'd ha' met a tramp an', over an' above givin' her her reckonin',--over an' above that, I say,--c'u'd ha' discoorsed wid her quite {{intelligent}} on the management av steers an' such at sea'? Forgit ut! Av coorse they will not. 'Twas the most compenjus conversation that iver accrued. Double game an' twice runnin'--all to us." [...] Dan kicked Harvey under the table, and Harvey choked in his cup.|$|E
60|$|These, however, {{are very}} fabulous legends, to which very {{cautious}} credence must be given; and though I {{am willing to}} admit the last quoted orthography of the name as very fit for prose, yet <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> which I peculiarly delight in, as at once poetical, melodious, and significant--and which {{we have on the}} authority of Master Juet, who, in his account of the voyage of the great Hudson, calls this Manna-hata--that is to say, the island of manna--or, in other words, a land flowing with milk and honey.|$|E
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> Fox Tor on Dartmoor, {{one of five}} {{outcrops}} on {{the western}} bank of the River Tavy in woodland north of Peter Tavy, at grid reference SX514788. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> on Bodmin Moor near Lewannick.|$|R
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> {{striking}} coincidence.|$|R
50|$|The nuraghe {{was made}} entirely from basaltic rocks, having a complex {{structure}} with a polylobate bastion and towers underground. Above it <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a church erected in 1970 {{in honor of}} St. Lussorio. Near <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> ancient church below which <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> small nuraghe.|$|R
6000|$|Noack, in any case, {{maintains}} that Paris has but {{one place to}} live in by day and to sleep in by night--his [Greek: talamos]. There he sleeps, eats, and polishes his weapons and armour. There Hector finds him looking to his gear; Helen and the maids are all there (Iliad, VI. 321-323). Is this quite certain? Are Helen and the maids in the [Greek: talamos], where Paris is polishing his corslet and looking to his bow, or in an adjacent room? If not in another room, why, when Hector is in the room talking to Paris, does Helen ask him to [...] "come in"? (Iliad, VI. 354). He is in, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> room whence she can hear him? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Explain myself!" [...] she repeated. [...] "Oh! <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> {{man like}} this in the world? I spare him, when my heart is breaking; I screen him when my own {{character}} is at stake; and HE--of all human beings, HE--turns on me now, and tells me that I ought to have explained myself! After believing in him as I did, after loving him as I did, after thinking of him by day, and dreaming of him by night--he wonders I didn't charge him with his disgrace the first time we met: 'My heart's darling, you are a Thief! My hero whom I love and honour, you have crept into my room under cover of the night, and stolen my Diamond!' That is what I ought to have said. You villain, you mean, mean, mean villain, I would have lost fifty diamonds, rather than see your face lying to me, as I see it lying now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{dwell on}} these trivialities because every year {{thousands}} of British boys enter these mills which grind exceeding small, and because these boys constitute in after life {{the great majority}} of the official, military, academic, professional, and a considerable proportion of the business classes of Great Britain. They become the Englishmen who say: [...] "Really!" [...] and they are {{for the most part the}} Englishmen who travel and reach America. The great defence I have always heard put up for our public schools is that they form character. As oatmeal is supposed to form bone in the bodies of Scotsmen, so our public schools are supposed to form good, sound moral fibre in British boys. And there is much in this plea. The life does make boys enduring, self-reliant, good-tempered and honourable, but it most carefully endeavours to destroy all original sin of individuality, spontaneity, and engaging freakishness. It implants, moreover, in {{the great majority of}} those who have lived it the mental attitude of that swell, who when asked where he went for his hats, replied: [...] "Blank's, of course. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> fellow's?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we are off {{the track}} sure; but it can't be helped now, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> little chance of finding our way back. The air isn't bad, and we'll keep on; it may <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> slope beside the one about which I have heard." ...|$|R
50|$|Cultural {{information}} {{could be the}} deciding factor in defining Woronora. Was there a Rain or Wallaroo Dreaming {{in this part of}} Sydney? Could reported dialogue of the Dreamtime ancestors make sense of then place? Or <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> noun unknown to us relating to black rock/s? Unfortunately the consequences of colonisation for the Dharug people in terms of land loss, dispersal and language loss mean this will probably never be known.|$|R
5000|$|O'Rourke {{states that}} an uncle {{of the writer}} George Moore (novelist), Augustus, was killed when thrown from his horse at Aintree in March 1845 and wonders [...] "Is it {{possible}} that this incident underwent a transformation in the popular mind, giving rise to the folklore account referred to above? Or <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>another</b> Moore fatality on the turf?" [...] Augustus Moore was described as [...] "much loved but somewhat eccentric." ...|$|R
