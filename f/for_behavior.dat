5|$|Most churches {{used two}} acts to {{sanction}} its members: censure and excommunication. Censure was a formal reprimand <b>for</b> <b>behavior</b> {{that did not}} conform with accepted religious and social norms, while excommunication involved full removal from church membership. Many perceived social evils, from fornication to public drunkenness, were dealt with through church discipline rather than through civil punishment. Church sanctions seldom held official recognition outside church membership and seldom resulted in civil or criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, such sanctions were a powerful tool of social control.|$|E
5|$|After Marian's death, {{numerous}} {{professionals in}} the field recognized her death with obituaries and biographies. Dr. Art Gillaspy and Dr. Elson Bihm of the University of Central Arkansas wrote an obituary for the American Psychologist. Psi Chi's journalEye on Psi Chi honored Marian, who had been a member for over sixty years, with a biography by Dr. Todd Wiebers of Henderson State. The year after her death, the Arkansas Historical Quarterly featured a retrospective on Marian, who had been a figure in the state of Arkansas for decades. Her husband Bob provided a biographical tribute for the Division 25 Recorder, the official publication of the APA's Division 25 <b>for</b> <b>Behavior</b> Analysis.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to develop the scale of self-efficacy <b>for</b> health <b>behavior,</b> and {{to examine the relationship between}} self-efficacy for health behvior and self-rated health. Six hundred and three women's university students participated in this study. In first analysis, the scale of self-efficacy <b>for</b> health <b>behavior</b> was developed and examined its reliability and validity. The results indicated that the scale of self-efficacy <b>for</b> health <b>behavior</b> had acceptable reliability and validity. A second analysis explored the relationship between self-rated health and self-efficacy <b>for</b> health <b>behavior.</b> Structural equation modeling indicated that the self-efficacy <b>for</b> health <b>behavior</b> had a significant positive relationship with the self-rated health. These results suggest that the self-efficacy <b>for</b> health <b>behavior</b> is an important factor in enhancement of the self-rated health...|$|R

5|$|Another {{approach}} to brain {{function is to}} examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences <b>for</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|E
5|$|While Bissell showed early {{promise as}} a dancer, he also {{showed signs of}} being a troubled young man and began taking drugs {{at the age of}} 14. He was {{expelled}} from his first school for dealing drugs on the premises. He was noticed by the American ballet dancer Edward Villella, who encouraged his parents to send him to a performing arts boarding school. In 1972 he joined the National Academy of Dance in Champaign, Illinois from which he was dismissed <b>for</b> <b>behavior</b> problems. Bissell then spent a year at the North Carolina School of the Arts which he left when he was informed that he should pay more attention to his academic studies. He hitch-hiked all the way to New York to pursue a lifelong career in dance as that's where the company's top schools are. He then won a scholarship to study at the School of American Ballet, where he was encouraged by Lincoln Kirstein, its founder, and Stanley Williams, one of his teachers. He was invented to join Balanchine's New York City Ballet and the American Ballet Theatre. He decided to join ABT and {{became a member of the}} corps. Though he quickly rose through the ranks.|$|E
5|$|While {{the courts}} in New Jersey allow actions based on dram shop {{liability}} or social host liability, they will instruct a jury to consider the intoxicated person's negligence under the doctrine of comparative negligence. Licensed establishments and social hosts may be liable for drunk driving accidents, assaults, falls, and other injuries and property damage caused by a customer, but are not liable <b>for</b> <b>behavior</b> which is unforeseeable (e.g. falling out of a tree), nor are they liable if they only served food or non-alcoholic beverages to a drunk patron. Dram shop and social host litigation may involve both compensatory and punitive damages. There is a 2-year statute of limitations for such lawsuits, but the time limit may be extended if the victim is a juvenile.|$|E

25|$|Behavior {{analysts are}} {{licensed}} {{in five states}} to provide services for clients with substance abuse, developmental disabilities, and mental illness. This profession draws on the evidence base of applied behavior analysis, behavior therapy, and the philosophy of behaviorism. Behavior analysts {{have at least a}} master's degree in behavior analysis or in a mental health related discipline as well as at least five core courses in applied behavior analysis (narrow focus in psychological education). Many behavior analysts have a doctorate. Most programs have a formalized internship program and several programs are offered online.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} a fuzzy decision-making algorithm <b>for</b> robot <b>behavior</b> coordination. The algorithm {{belongs to the}} arbitration class of behavior coordination mechanisms, under which only one behavior is running at a time. However, {{it is possible to}} use a hierarchical decision mechanism <b>for</b> hierarchical <b>behaviors</b> without interference between hierarchical levels. With this fuzzy decision method it is possible to represent a specific model of the world where the robot evolves. This algorithm consists of defining a set of behaviors, a set of world states, a cost function <b>for</b> <b>behaviors,</b> a set of goals, and a set of constraints. <b>For</b> each <b>behavior</b> and actual world state pair, a cost function is computed. The cost of each pair is evaluated by the overall goals. Goals and constraints are aggregated using a fuzzy operator and the optimal choice is the behavior with the maximum resulting value. This algorithm was tested with success in realistic simulations of a goalkeeper soccer robot. 1...|$|R

40|$|Moral {{motives are}} {{important}} <b>for</b> pro-environmental <b>behavior.</b> But such {{behavior is not}} only motivated by moral or environmental concerns. We examined what higher-order motives, other than morality, may be important <b>for</b> understanding pro-environmental <b>behavior,</b> by studying consumer identities. In three studies (N = 877) four consumer identities were distinguished: moral, wasteful, frugal, and thrifty. Frugal and moral consumer identities were most salient and were the strongest predictors of pro-environmental behaviors, but in different ways. Frugality, which is related to, but distinct from thriftiness, was particularly important <b>for</b> <b>behaviors</b> associated with waste reduction of any kind (including money). The findings suggest that people adopt the same <b>behavior</b> <b>for</b> different reasons, in ways consistent with their consumer identities. People manage multiple consumer identities simultaneously and environmental policy {{is likely to be}} more effective if it addresses these multiple identities...|$|R

25|$|The {{human brain}} {{is not fully}} {{developed}} {{by the time a}} person reaches puberty. Between the ages of 10 and 25, the brain undergoes changes that have important implications <b>for</b> <b>behavior</b> (see Cognitive development below). The brain reaches 90% of its adult size by the time a person is six years of age. Thus, the brain does not grow in size much during adolescence. However, the creases in the brain continue to become more complex until the late teens. The biggest changes in the folds of the brain during this time occur in the parts of the cortex that process cognitive and emotional information.|$|E
