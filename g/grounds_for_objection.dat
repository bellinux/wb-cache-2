6000|$|Further {{fuel for}} {{excitement}} was supplied {{the same year}} (1841) in a fantastic project by which a bishop, appointed alternately by Great Britain and Prussia and with his headquarters at Jerusalem, was to take charge through a somewhat miscellaneous region, of any German protestants or {{members of the church}} of England or anybody else who might be disposed to accept his authority. The scheme stirred much enthusiasm in the religious world, but it deepened alarm among the more logical of the high churchmen. Ashley and the evangelicals were keen for it as the blessed beginning of a restoration of Israel, and the king of Prussia hoped to gain over the Lutherans and others of his subjects by this side-door into true episcopacy. Politics were not absent, and some hoped that England might find in the new protestant church such an instrument in those uncomfortable regions, as Russia possessed in the Greek church and France in the Latin. Dr. Arnold was delighted at the thought that the new church at Jerusalem would comprehend persons using different liturgies and subscribing different articles,--his favourite pattern for the church of England. Pusey at first rather liked the idea of a bishop to represent the ancient British church in the city of the Holy Sepulchre; but Newman and Hope, with a keener instinct for their position, distrusted the whole design in root and branch as a betrayal of the church, and Pusey soon came to their mind. With caustic scorn Newman asked how the anglican church, without ceasing to be a church, could become an associate and protector of nestorians, jacobites, monophysites, and all the heretics one could hear of, and even form a sort of league with the mussulman against the Greek orthodox and the Latin catholics. Mr. Gladstone could not be drawn to go these lengths. Nobody could be more of a logician than Mr. Gladstone when he liked, no logician could wield a more trenchant blade; but nobody ever knew better in complex circumstance the perils of the logical short cut. Hence, according to his general manner in all dubious cases, he moved slowly, and laboured to remove practical <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>objection.</b> Ashley describes him (October 16) at a dinner at Bunsen's rejoicing in the bishopric, and proposing the health of the new prelate, and this gave Ashley pleasure, for 'Gladstone is a good man and a clever man and an industrious man.'[184] While resolute against any plan for what Hope called gathering up the scraps of Christendom and making a new church out of them, and resolute against what he himself called the inauguration of an experimental or fancy church, Mr. Gladstone declared himself ready 'to brave misconstruction for the sake of union with any Christian men, provided the terms of union were not contrary to sound principles.' With a strenuous patience that was thoroughly characteristic, he set to work to bring the details of the scheme into an order conformable to his own views, and he even became a trustee of the endowment fund. Two bishops in succession filled the see, but in the fulness of time most men agreed with Newman, who 'never heard of any either good or harm that bishopric had ever done,' except what it had done for him. To him it gave a final shake, and brought him on {{to the beginning of the}} end.[185] ...|$|E
60|$|One of my {{principal}} <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>objection</b> to the Abyssinians is {{that they}} are such an intensely lazy race. Now, if people like to be lazy, and to eat the scanty bread of idleness instead of the large loaf gained by hard work, it is their own business, and a mere matter of taste, in favour of which there is much to be said. But the Abyssinian, although intensely lazy, is by no means satisfied to eat the bread of idleness. The noble savage is keenly awake to the value of labour, and insists that all the members of his family, with the exception only of himself and such of his sons as may be big enough to have their own way, work like the veriest slaves. You will see a great lout of a man walking lazily along towards the camp, armed with his spear and shield, while before him stagger his old mother, his wife, his sister, and his four or five children, carrying enormous bundles of hay. I am not exaggerating when I say that you will frequently see little girls not more than seven years old carrying bundles of hay of forty-five pounds weight into camp; and poor little mites of three or four years old carry a proportionate burden. The weight is never carried on the head, always upon the back, fastened by a thong of leather, which goes over the arms just below the shoulder and across the chest. The child or woman, as the case may be, walks bent forward, almost double. The men never carry loads; it is beneath the dignity of a noble savage. The whole of the work is done by the females and by the little boys of the family. My blood has fairly boiled many times, and I have longed heartily to lay my riding-whip across the shoulders of these lazy scoundrels, who are too lazy to work, but not too proud to drive their little children to work, and to live upon the result. The boys do, as I have said, a certain amount. When they are quite little they do nearly as much as their sisters, but as they grow up they do less and less, and it is rare to see a boy over twelve years old carrying a burden. The women here carry their babies on their backs, and not across the hip as the Hindoostanee women always do. The children are held in a sort of small shawl of leather, which is wrapped tightly round the mother, and only the top of the little thing’s head is generally to be seen. In this way the mother has her arms free, and can carry about her bundle of wood or grass for sale; but in this case the burden is, of course, carried in her arms before her. I have often wondered that the children survive the double risk—of suffocation, from pressure against their mother’s backs, and of sunstroke, from the sun coming down full upon the unprotected tops of their little bald heads. They do not seem to mind it, and I do not think that I have heard {{more than one or two}} infants utter a wail when being carried in that position. I can only suppose that the natural warmth of their mothers’ naked backs is agreeable to them; but, with our present style of dress, it is not an experiment which I should recommend an English nurse to try with a fractious child, unless she wishes a coroner’s inquest to be held upon it, with possibly other more unpleasant proceedings to follow.|$|E

Even this, however, did not overcome me, and I stood to my guns. Sir Harry was published in one volume, containing something over the normal 300 pages, with an average of 220 words to a page,--which I had settled with my conscience to be the proper length of a novel volume. I may here mention that on one occasion, and one occasion only, a publisher got the better of me in a matter of volumes. He had a two-volume novel of mine running through a certain magazine, and had it printed complete in three volumes before I knew where I was,--before I had seen a sheet of the letterpress. I stormed for a while, but I had not the heart to make him break up the type.|$|R
5000|$|Both of Baxter's sons {{followed}} their parents' pacifism. His elder son, Terence, was imprisoned for refusing conscription during World War II. The National Service Emergency Regulations 1940, under {{which he was}} called up, were almost as limiting on the <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> conscientious <b>objection</b> as the 1916 Act. Regulation 21 (2) required the person objecting to prove they held [...] ".. a genuine belief that {{it is wrong to}} engage in warfare in any circumstances." [...] The regulation further stated that [...] "Evidence of active and genuine membership of a pacifist religious body may in general be accepted as evidence of the convictions of the objector..." [...] Active and continuous membership of the Society of Friends or Christadelphians prior to the outbreak of war was taken sufficient proof. The Appeal Boards set up under the regulations tended to take a very narrow and sometimes contradictory view of conscientious objectors. After an April 1941 British court case those deemed to be politically based were unlikely to be accepted. The continuation of conscription must have been ironic for Baxter as many members of the now governing Labour Party had been imprisoned during World War I for opposing conscription. The prime minister, Michael Joseph Savage, had been very vocal opposing conscription during that war.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a charge that is often made against consequentialist moral theories: that they are unacceptably demanding. This is called the Overdemandingness Objection. The paper first distinguishes three interpretations of the Objection as based on the three {{dimensions}} of moral demands: scope, content, and authority. It is then argued that neither the scope, nor the content-based understanding of the Objection is viable. Constraining the scope of consequentialism is neither helpful, nor justified, hence the pervasiveness of consequentialism cannot be the <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> the <b>Objection.</b> Although recent approaches interpret the Objection as a claim about the excessively demanding content of consequentialism, {{it is argued that}} the stringency of consequentialism is also unproblematic insofar as demandingness is concerned. These results show {{that the only way to}} put the Objection is by focusing on the inescapability of consequentialism. The Objection thus takes the following form: consequentialism is overdemanding because it requires us, with decisive force, to do things that we do not have decisive reason to perform. However, in the last part of the paper it is shown that defending this interpretation of the Objection is at best an open-ended and perilous enterprise. The paper concludes that the case for authority is weak: although this is the only defensible way to advocate the Objection, its successful defence depends on the truth of further substantial philosophical positions...|$|R
40|$|I am {{sympathetic}} with Ms. Burns’ {{general philosophy}} of vagueness as a pervasive, multidimensional phenomenon {{with a variety}} of sources. I am not, however, all that comfortable with some of the specific arguments she offers in support of this view.

40|$|This thesis {{makes an}} {{historical}} and contemporaneous analysis of patenting of methods of medical treatment {{of human beings}} in Australia and other common law jurisdictions that derived their origin from the UK law. The issue of patenting of methods of medical treatment has never been an easy question to discuss for it raises public policy considerations surrounding this area. The main difficulty derives from {{the conflict between the}} intellectual property and practice of medicine. There is a public policy concern that in order to ensure the best possible health treatment, physicians must always be free in their choice of treatment. Since a patent may restrict this freedom, many countries around the globe prohibit methods of medical treatment from being granted patent protection. Yet, Australian courts decided to depart from those exclusions. This thesis examines how courts deal with express exclusions of patents for method of medical treatment and how such exclusions can be avoided by creative drafting of patent specifications. It will also examine the approach taken in Australia where there are no express exclusions. It first provides the descriptive background of the case law in UK, Member States of the European Patent Convention, Canada, Israel, New Zealand, US and Australia {{in order to make a}} comparative analysis of the approaches adopted in these countries in dealing with the issue, and in order to establish the framework around which the doctrinal issues can be analysed. Against this background an examination of the origins of the patent law is necessary in order to fully assess the interpretation of patent legislation by courts and consequences of such interpretation for medical profession. The thesis investigates the pre-enacting history of the 1624 Statute of Monopolies in order to analyse whether patenting of methods of medical treatment of human beings is 'generally inconvenient' within the meaning of the proviso to s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies, which in turn, form a part of s 18 (1) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth). The analysis of early patent law cases at the time they were argued and decided will lead to the conclusion that the actual original meaning of the term 'generally inconvenient' has been wrongly interpreted and applied by modern courts. The thesis considers the role of the courts in deciding whether methods of medical treatment should be granted patent protection and whether judges should and/or have ability to make moral or public policy judgments in interpreting statutes. The thesis explore the consequences of interpretation of 'generally inconvenient' as a main public policy objection to granting patents for methods of medical treatment. It concludes that it is questionable whether the term 'generally inconvenient' includes public policy considerations in its scope, and though there may be some circumstances where a patent to method of medical treatment should be rejected on public policy grounds, 'generally inconvenient' does not provide a basis upon which patents to methods of medical treatment can be denied. The thesis is that such methods should not be expressly excluded from patenting. Each method must be treated equally with other inventions and examined on its merits, on case by case basis. The tensions associated with patents for methods of medical treatment can be resolved within patent legislation by making the public policy <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>objection</b> a separate criterion for patentability, equally relevant for any invention. Accordingly, the author argues that legislative amendments are necessary to rectify the existing problem and makes a number of proposals to this effect. The author also suggests the involvement of an independent body to make public policy decisions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{this paper}} I analyze the alleged {{conflict}} between economic incentives to efficiently utilize health care {{resources and the}} obligation to provide patients with the best possible medical care. My analysis is developed in four stages. First, I discuss briefly the nature of prospective payment systems and economic incentives {{as well as the}} issue of professional auton-omy. Second, I disscuss the notion of an incentive for action both as an economic incentive and as a concept of moral psychology. Third, I analyze several definitions of the physician's professional obligation and discuss four conditions that morally qualify the obligation. And fourth, I explore why the views of economists and physicians differ so strikingly on the question of economic incentives. In the process of this analysis, I argue that criticisms of prospective payment systems which are premised primarily on the conflict between economic incentives to contain cost and the professional obligation of beneficence are probably as much a matter of rhetoric as serious argumen-tation. Key Words: autonomy, beneficence, cost containment", economic incentives, moral obligation, prospective payment. Critics of cost-containment efforts such as Diagnosis related Groups (DRGs) and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) often sound a common theme: If cost-containment efforts solely eliminated waste or unnecessary services, then there would be no <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>objection.</b> However, it is argued that prospective payment systems place physicians in the morally untenable posi-tion of having to deny possibly beneficial services to patients...|$|E
40|$|E-tolling was {{recently}} implemented on roads in Gauteng, South Africa. This {{gave rise to}} a great deal of protest by road users and a court battle between the South African National Roads Agency (SANRAL) and the Opposition to Urban Tolling Alliance, a body representing road users. The e-tolling system was criticised at various levels and on numerous grounds, some financial and others appearing to be emotional. This thesis attempted to analyse the various <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>objection</b> against the system, the main goal of the research being to analyse e-tolling in Gauteng to ascertain whether or not the introduction of e-tolling was justified or whether an alternative method of taxation to pay for the upgrading of Gauteng roads would have been more cost-effective. Secondary data in the form of documents from multiple sources was used in the analysis, including an Economic Impact Assessment {{that was one of the}} key inputs into the decision to introduce e-tolling. It was found that there are multiple problems plaguing the e-toll system and e-tolling is not the most cost-effective taxation method of paying for Gauteng roads.

It was suggested that the best taxation method/s to pay for the roads would have been using a fuel levy and general tax revenue as the primary funding methods, with vehicle licensing fees and long distance toll roads as secondary methods to aid the primary methods...|$|E

[78] The {{objection}} {{has been}} made, {{that the long}} polar night would of itself be fatal {{to the existence of}} such a luxuriant vegetation as we know to have existed as far as 80° N. Lat., and that there must have been some alteration of the position of the pole, or diminution of the obliquity of the ecliptic, to permit such plants as magnolias and large-leaved maples to flourish. But there appears to be really no valid <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> such an <b>objection.</b> Not only are numbers of Alpine and Arctic evergreens deeply buried in the snow for many months without injury, but a variety of tropical and sub-tropical plants are preserved in the hot-houses of St. Petersburg and other northern cities, which are closely matted during winter, and are thus exposed to as much darkness as the night of the Arctic regions. We have besides no proof that any of the Arctic trees or large shrubs were evergreens, and the darkness would certainly not be prejudical to deciduous plants. With a suitable temperature there is nothing to prevent a luxuriant vegetation up to the pole, and the long continued day is known to be highly favourable to the development of foliage, which in the same species is larger and better developed in Norway than in the south of England.|$|R
6000|$|One of the {{earliest}} and most often repeated objections was, {{that it was difficult}} [...] "to imagine a reason why variations tending in an infinitesimal degree in any special direction should be preserved," [...] or to believe that the complex adaptation of living organisms could have been produced [...] "by infinitesimal beginnings." [...] Now this term [...] "infinitesimal," [...] used by a well-known early critic of the Origin of Species, was never made use of by Darwin himself, who spoke only of variations being [...] "slight," [...] and of the [...] "small amount" [...] of the variations that might be selected. Even in using these terms he undoubtedly afforded <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> the <b>objection</b> above made, that such small and slight variations could be of no real use, and would not determine the survival of the individuals possessing them. We have seen, however, in our third chapter, that even Darwin's terms were hardly justified; and that the variability of many important species is of considerable amount, and may very often be properly described as large. As this is found to be the case both in animals and plants, and in all their chief groups and subdivisions, and also to apply to all the separate parts and organs that have been compared, we must take it as proved that the average amount of variability presents no difficulty whatever {{in the way of the}} action of natural selection. It may be here mentioned that, up to the time of the preparation of the last edition of The Origin of Species, Darwin had not seen the work of Mr. J.A. Allen of Harvard University (then only just published), which gave us the first body of accurate comparisons and measurements demonstrating this large amount of variability. Since then evidence of this nature has been accumulating, and we are, therefore, now in a far better position to appreciate the facilities for natural selection, in this respect, than was Mr. Darwin himself.|$|R

It provides a critical assessment of the academic interpretation of Wales�s attitudes towards War, assesses the development of opposition to the continuation of the War from Autumn 1914 onwards, and describes the range of anti-war activity and analyses the sources of political and religious opposition to the War. It provides an analysis of the composition of opposition to the War on religious grounds in Wales, and considers the significance of the Christian pacifist organisation, the Fellowship of Reconciliation, together with a review of the extent of {{the opposition to}} the War within Nonconformist denominations. The significance of key individuals such as Principal Thomas Rees and key Welsh publications such as Y Deyrnas are highlighted, and particular consideration is given to the role of millenarian sects within the anti-war movement. The politically based anti-war movement in Wales is examined primarily through an analysis of the activities of the Independent Labour Party and its impact in two of its local strongholds, in Briton Ferry and Merthyr Tydfil. It also considers the role of the National Council for Civil Liberties and the No- Conscription Fellowship and those involved in industrial agitation against conscription in south Wales, and the extent to which this featured as part of the anti-war movement. This thesis provides an analysis of the numbers of conscientious objectors in Wales, their <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>objection,</b> their geographical distribution and their political and religious allegiances. It considers how the State dealt with the challenge of conscientious objection and how successful the anti-war movement was in challenging military conscription and support for the war in Wales...|$|E
40|$|Amid {{the voices}} that {{energize}} {{debate in the}} postmodern public square, voices from conservative Protestantism have traditionally been quite muted and indistinct—missing from much public debate. But {{in the past few}} years there has been a burgeoning of Evangelical writing on the subject of interaction between the conditions of postmodernity and religious life. This renaissance has been largely unstudied, though its repercussions have been substantial. Most importantly, this resurgence has produced a ground-level rethinking of issues pertaining to the continuance of effective religious life, and indeed, of authentic personhood within the context of late modernity. One Christian social critic who is substantially engaging with the general academic discourse on modernity is Canadian Craig Gay, an Evangelical. Gay’s work draws on earlier analysis from such discordant sources as Secularization Theory (Max Weber), Constructionist sociology (Peter Berger), socio-technological critique (Jacques Ellul), secular psychology (Kenneth Gergen) and personal philosophical reflection (Martin Buber). Through these sources he analyzes the malaise of both the modern secular world and the Evangelical community itself, concluding that in relation to modern social conditions the interests of the Evangelical community and of non-Evangelicals intersect—for the chief problem with modernity is its diminishment of personhood in favour of an ethos of instrumentalism, control and manipulation. But, in Gay’s view, secular ideologies do not provide sufficient <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>objection</b> to the momentum of “The Modern Project” and to the Myth of Progress; because in the absence of reference to the vertical dimension of critical reflection, to consideration of God, secular social criticism in regard to issues of personhood is crippled. The general argument of this paper is that it is incumbent upon the Evangelical community to reevaluate its interaction with modernity, and that it is in the interests of social critics from other camps to the new Evangelical voice speak. In Gay’s work we find a productive symbiosis between a distinctly Evangelical social criticism and the broader spectrum of critical discourse...|$|E
