25|$|Isolated {{properties}} of surfaces of revolution were known already to Archimedes. The development of calculus {{in the seventeenth}} century provided a more systematic way of proving them. Curvature of general surfaces was first studied by Euler. In 1760 he proved a formula for the curvature of a plane section of a surface and in 1771 he considered surfaces represented in a parametric form. Monge laid down the foundations of their theory in his classical memoir L'application de l'analyse à la géometrie which appeared in 1795. The defining contribution to the theory of surfaces was made by Gauss in two remarkable papers written in 1825 and 1827. This marked a new departure from tradition because for the first time Gauss considered the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>geometry</b> of a surface, the properties which are determined only by the geodesic distances between points on the surface independently of the particular way in which the surface is located in the ambient Euclidean space. The crowning result, the Theorema Egregium of Gauss, established that the Gaussian curvature is an intrinsic invariant, i.e. invariant under local isometries. This point of view was extended to higher-dimensional spaces by Riemann and led to what is known today as Riemannian geometry. The nineteenth century was the golden age for the theory of surfaces, from both the topological and the differential-geometric point of view, with most leading geometers devoting themselves to their study. Darboux collected many results in his four-volume treatise Théorie des surfaces (1887–1896).|$|E

The observed spontaneous pattern is modeled using planar triangles and cylindrical arcs, and the ribbon structure is shown to arise from a maximization of the end-to-end length of the ribbon, i. e. from an optimal use of ribbon length.

40|$|Non-rigid shapes are {{generally}} known as objects where the three dimensional geometry may deform by internal and/or external forces. Deformable shapes {{are all around}} us, ranging from macromolecules, to natural objects such as {{the trees in the}} forest or the fruits in our gardens, and even human bodies. The development of measurements to accurately describe such non-rigid shapes has wide application. It follows that, when aiming to perform measurement of non-rigid shapes, one need to ensure that the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>geometries</b> are preserved in the presence of deformations. This paper introduces physics-based techniques for the measurements of such deformable shapes. Our work is based on the idea of heat propagation through a surface. Specifically, we introduce so-called multi-measurements to measure the distance between two points on an object and reflective measurements that allows for the exploration of a region around a point. Further, we introduce two novel meta-measurements that extend the bag of features concept. We illustrate our methodology in the context of structural proteomics and molecular docking.

40|$|Atomic pair {{distribution}} {{functions are}} useful {{because they have}} an easy intuitive interpretation and can be obtained both experimentally and from computer-generated structure models. For bulk materials, atomic pair distribution functions are solely determined by the <b>intrinsic</b> atomic <b>geometry,</b> i. e., how atoms are positioned with respect to one another. For a nanomaterial, however, the atomic pair distribution function also depends on the shape {{and size of the}} nanomaterial. A modified form of the radial distribution function is discussed that decouples shape and size effects from intrinsic effects so that nanomaterials of any shape and size, sharing a common atomic geometry, map onto a universal curve, by using a form factor. Mapping onto this universal curve allows differences in the <b>intrinsic</b> atomic <b>geometry</b> of nanomaterials of various shapes and sizes to be directly compared. This approach is demonstrated on nanoscale amorphous and crystalline silica models.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{continue}} our investigation of the thin obstacle problem with variable coefficients which was initiated in KRS 14, KRSI. Using a partial Hodograph-Legendre transform and the implicit function theorem, we prove higher order Hölder regularity for the regular free boundary, if the associated coefficients are of the corresponding regularity. For the zero obstacle this yields an improvement of a full derivative for the free boundary regularity compared to the regularity of the metric. In the presence of non-zero obstacles or inhomogeneities, we gain three halves of a derivative for the free boundary regularity {{with respect to the}} regularity of the inhomogeneity. Further we show analyticity of the regular free boundary for analytic metrics. We also discuss the low regularity set-up of W^ 1,p metrics with p>n+ 1 with and without (L^p) inhomogeneities.
