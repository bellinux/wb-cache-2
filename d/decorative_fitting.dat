50|$|After World War II {{the castle}} was {{acquired}} by the province of Luxembourg. The building was renovated but the province failed to find a use for it. As a result, little by little, the castle was neglected and was subsequently looted by burglars who removed valuable furniture and <b>decorative</b> <b>fittings</b> from the interior.|$|R
25|$|Because {{the nature}} of wood lends itself to easy working {{it has been a}} favoured {{material}} for <b>decorative</b> <b>fittings</b> within churches. It can be carved, veneered and inlaid with other materials. It can be lacquered, painted or gilt. It can be used for artefacts and free-standing sculptures. It is relatively robust unless finely carved, but must be protected from mould and insects.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to church building, Tapper was also engaged in ecclesiastical <b>decorative</b> <b>fittings</b> and ornaments. The ornate {{entrance to the}} choir at Ludlow Parish Church is his work, as is the gilded altarpiece in St Chad's, Stafford and the organ casing and font cover in St Wulfram's Church, Grantham, and he designed a silver processional cross for York Minster. He also enjoyed a lucrative arrangement with the Gas Light and Coke Company, designing appliance showrooms in the Art Deco Streamline Moderne style.|$|R

Goal {{of this work}} is assessment of Roman military equipment, which is mostly upcoming from limes and iconographical side of gravestones or other reliefs from that period. Based on this analysis the work is primary focused on typology of <b>decorative</b> <b>fittings</b> of scabbards, for example protective features (display of gods and heroes, apotropaic point), further work appraise propaganda motives for example {{in the form of}} a portrait of emperor and his triumph...|$|R
50|$|It {{is known}} for its {{traditional}} smithies, which produce a variety of <b>decorative</b> metal <b>fittings.</b> There is an iron forging museum in Kropa. Metalworking has an ancient tradition in Kropa, with evidence of metalworks from Celtic times in the wider area and the earliest furnaces actually in Kropa from the 14th century onwards.|$|R
5000|$|Substrate {{pretreatment}} in a {{plasma environment}} is required prior to deposition of thin films on mechanical components such as automotive parts, metal cutting tools and <b>decorative</b> <b>fittings.</b> The substrates are {{immersed in a}} plasma and biased to a high voltage {{of a few hundred}} volts. This causes high energy ion bombardment that sputters away any contamination. In cases when the plasma contains metal ions, they can be implanted into the substrate to a depth of a few nm. HIPIMS is used to generate a plasma with a high density and high proportion of metal ions. When looking at the film-substrate interface in cross-section, one can see a clean interface. Epitaxy or atomic registry is typical between the crystal of a nitride film and the crystal of a metal substrate when HIPIMS is used for pretreatment. [...] HIPIMS has been used for the pretreatment of steel substrates {{for the first time in}} February 2001 by A.P. Ehiasarian.|$|R
5000|$|Belt buckles {{became more}} popular as fashion {{accessories}} {{in the early}} 20th century, as the tops of trousers moved more toward the waist. [...] "Western-style" [...] belt buckles were largely popularized by cowboy movies in the United States and are often awarded to winners in rodeo events as prize medals or trophies, a custom later adopted by the Western States Endurance Run {{and a few other}} ultra-marathons. The large, flat surface of the western-style belt buckles make them a popular ornament or style of jewelry. Decorative [...] "buckle sets" [...] may contain a metal buckle, one or more matching loops which sit next to the buckle and a metal tip for the opposite, [...] "tongue" [...] end of the belt. [...] "Belt plates" [...] may be decorative covers for a plain buckle or other <b>decorative</b> <b>fittings</b> affixed to the belt itself, similar to [...] "conchos" [...] (from a Spanish word for [...] "shell").

5000|$|This led to Fehr, at age 29, {{being offered}} the {{position}} of park architect-foreman for the National Park Service (NPS) {{at the beginning of}} 1934. He was assigned to the new Bastrop State Park project near Austin, part of the state's nascent parks system in the era of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). [...] From 1934 to 1937 he designed, supervised and participated in the construction of all the structures there {{as well as at the}} adjoining Buescher State Park near Smithville. [...] These were in the proscribed [...] "rustic" [...] or [...] "pioneer" [...] style favored by the NPS at that time. [...] He also designed and supervised the making of furniture and other <b>decorative</b> <b>fittings</b> used not only at Bastrop but throughout the Texas parks system. [...] Other than some early student commissions Bastrop was the first work of Fehr's to be executed in his own right, and it was soon noted. In Park and Recreation Structures, originally published by the NPS in 1938, the author Good commented that the Bastrop guest cabins [...] "add up to a total effect that is extraordinarily individual and attractive".|$|R
50|$|The {{atmosphere}} in the Netherlands was tense due to the rebellion, preaching of Calvinist leaders, hunger after the bad harvest of 1565, and economic difficulties due to the Northern Seven Years' War. In early August 1566, a monastery church at Steenvoorde in Flanders (now in Northern France) was sacked by a mob led by the preacher Sebastian Matte. This incident was followed by similar riots elsewhere in Flanders, and before long the Netherlands had become {{the scene of the}} Beeldenstorm, a riotous iconoclastic movement by Calvinists, who stormed churches and other religious buildings to desecrate and destroy church art and all kinds of <b>decorative</b> <b>fittings</b> over most of the country. The number of actual image-breakers appears to have been relatively small, and the exact backgrounds of the movement are debated, but in general local authorities did not rein in the vandalism. The actions of the iconoclasts drove the nobility into two camps, with Orange and other grandees opposing the movement and others, notably Henry of Brederode, supporting it. Even before he answered the petition by the nobles, Philip had lost control in the troublesome Netherlands. He saw no other option than to send an army to suppress the rebellion. On 22 August 1567, Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, marched into Brussels at the head of 10,000 troops.|$|R
5|$|For {{protection}} and preservation, a polished Japanese sword needs a scabbard. A fully mounted scabbard (koshirae) may {{consist of a}} lacquered body, a taped hilt, a sword guard (tsuba) and <b>decorative</b> metal <b>fittings.</b> Though the original purpose was to protect a sword from damage, from early times on Japanese sword mountings became a status symbol and were used to add dignity. Starting in the Heian period, a sharp distinction was made between swords designed for use in battle and those for ceremonial use. Tachi long swords were worn edge down suspended by two cords or chains from the waist belt. The cords were attached to two eyelets on the scabbard.|$|R

40|$|This section {{deals with}} the last of the {{traditional}} craft skills that go into making a butsudan: that of the <b>decorative</b> metal <b>fittings</b> (kazari kanagu). Methods of making the fittings are discussed in some detail. Then the structure and shape of the pieces and where they are placed on the bustudan is considered. Information about the types of burins (punches) and their uses is outlined in the section on tools. Particulars of the different types of metalworking are given. Of the two types of metal artisans one uses heated metal and the other uses cold metal. The three cold metal techniques are engraving, light embossing and cutting out. Heating allows the use of thicker metal along with carving and deep embossing techniques. Information about these four is given in some detail. Finally we look briefly at the way these pieces are attached to the butsudan...|$|R
50|$|The lower foyer was extensive, with {{interior}} finishes of {{dark brown}} brick and horizontal timber panelling stained dark brown; {{the ceiling was}} also lined with the same dark timber. This theme is continued through to rubbish bins, ashtrays and display units which are made of the same timber with strong horizontal design elements and aluminium details. Boxed, timber pelmet lighting ran along the walls throughout both {{the upper and lower}} foyers and the stairs. The foyer space was arranged symmetrically with staircases of identical detailing {{on either side of the}} centrally located ticket office. The ticket office was located in the space beneath the stairs to Cinema Two (which was previously occupied by a fountain and <b>decorative</b> light <b>fitting).</b> Bold geometric carpet with a pattern of purple, green and blue circles and ellipses in a black background covered the floor throughout the entire foyer area, including the stairs.|$|R
40|$|Na velikoj prapornoj zaravni uz pradavni vodeni put Dunavom gdje je danas Ilok, spojile su se temeljne silnice koje su predodredile oblikovanje niza uzastopnih prapovijesnih, antičkih i srednjovjekovnih, odnosno novovjekovnih aglomeracija. Oblikovala se središnja točka vrlo dugotrajnoga života u prostoru na kojem su se preklapali srednjoeuropski, podunavski i sredozemni utjecaji sve do našeg doba. To je točka s koje autor, osvjetljavajući vrlo zanimljiv i bitan detalj, tj. nalaze okova od korica dviju nabožnih knjiga, otkrivene tijekom sustavnih arheoloških istraživanja na položaju dvora vojvoda Iločkih u Iloku, potvrđuje izuzetno visoku kulturnu razinu toga kasnosrednjovjekovnog grada. Te spoznaje dovode se u svezu s dvorom i politikom kralja Matije Korvina, a ujedno se naslućuje postojanje onodobnih posrednih snažnih sveza s tiskarskim oficinama Venecije, ali i kontakata s Njemačkom. Svi dokazani umjetničko-obrtni detalji iz Iloka, kao i srodni primjerci opreme kasnosrednjovjekovnih nabožnih i inih knjiga, otkriveni na srodnim nalazištima unutar međuriječja Drave, Dunava i Save, snažno integriraju prostor kasnosrednjovjekovne Slavonije, kao aktivnog sudionika, u povijesnu zbilju Europe. At a {{naturally}} protected {{position on a}} large loess plateau along the ancient waterway of the Danube, where present-day Ilok lies, the main forces predetermining {{the shape of a}} succession of prehistoric, classical antiquity, mediaeval and new-era agglomerations intersected. The central point of the ongoing life was formed in an area where Central European, Danubian and Mediterranean influences have overlapped to the present day. This is the point from which the author, shedding light on an extraordinarily interesting and significant item, i. e. the finding of the fittings of two liturgical books excavated in the course of systematic archaeological excavations {{on the site of the}} Duke of Ilok’s Palace in Ilok, confirms that the cultural standards of this late-Mediaeval town had been extremely high. The liturgical books were intended for the court chapel, which was a part of the impressive uncovered northern wing of the Palace of Duke Nikola of Ilok, King of Bosnia. Based on the established parallels, they were used in the last quarter of the fifteenth century – during the rule of Duke Lovro of Ilok (1477 - 1524). The archaeological knowledge of the <b>decorative</b> <b>fittings</b> of the liturgical books associates them with the court and policy of King Matthias Corvinus. At the same time, it suggests indirect close links with Venetian printing houses, and also contacts with Germany. These links were particularly pronounced in the 1480 s, which has been determined with a high degree of probability as the production period of the liturgical books discovered in Ilok and on six other late-Mediaeval sites in Slavonia. According to the Decree on the Standardisation of Liturgical Books, issued in 1479 by King Matthias Corvinus, these books had to be standardised and printed for the needs of dioceses in his Central European Kingdom. All arts and crafts items from Ilok, as well as related examples of fittings of late-Mediaeval liturgical and other books found on related sites (courts, churches, monasteries) within the Drava, Danube and Sava interfluves, bring together the late-Mediaeval Slavonian region, representing it as an active participant in Europe’s historical reality, endangered by the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. At the same time, they represent clear evidence of the need for religious and, most probably, other kinds of literature in the Drava, Danube and Sava interfluves, which has until recently been observed as a certain spiritual hiatus...|$|R
