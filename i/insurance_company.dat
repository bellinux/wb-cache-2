40|$|This project {{seeks to}} {{determine}} the X-efficiencies ofboth life and non-life <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> in Kenya. It also establishes whether the X-efficiency ofthese <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> {{is affected by the}} type of business (life or non-life <b>insurance</b> <b>companies),</b> size of the finn and the profitability of the company. The data set consists of reinsurance costs, total benefits paid, administrative expenses, other expenses which altogether constitute the inputs and gross premiums are the outputs for the companies. The model to be used in this study is the Data Envelope Analysis. Using the Data Envelope analysis, the study shall be restricted to analyze the. efficiency of <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> by use of output-oriented Constant Return-to-Scale (CRS). It is expected that firms operating at optimal economies of scale are expected to have the lowest costs and the resulting higher profits lead to higher market concentrations (Hao, 2004). The results of the mean X-efficiency scores for the full sample of the large and small <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> was also determined. The large <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> recorded high mean efficiency scores compared to the small <b>insurance</b> <b>companies.</b> This implies that the larger <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> are operating efficiently relative to the small <b>companies.</b> The large <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> recorded a mean X-efficiency score of 69 % compared to 29 % for the small <b>insurance</b> <b>companies.</b> This means that the large <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> are operating at 69 % output-oriented constant returns to scale while the small <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> are operating at 29 % output-oriented constant returns to scale...|$|R

5|$|In February 1998, the Norwegian Ministry of Justice {{stated that}} the {{relatives}} {{did not have a}} right to occupational injury compensation from the Norwegian National Insurance. Because of the Svalbard Treaty, the archipelago is an economic free zone and Arktikugol is exempt from paying social insurance, so its employees did not have a right to Norwegian benefits. Had this been the case, widows would have received about NOK600,000 per worker. By 1998, a few of the relatives had accepted the US$20,000 compensation, while the rest of them were planning to sue both the airline's <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> and Arktikugol. Among the issues in the case, which took place at Nord-Troms District Court, was whether the accident was to be considered a working accident, and thus result in injury compensation from the mining company. In November, it was decided that the Ukrainians needed to make a guarantee for NOK2.5 million to run the case, which they could not afford. They therefore had no alternative than to accept the proposal from the <b>insurance</b> <b>company.</b> In June 1999, the parties agreed on a settlement, where the compensation was not disclosed to the public. It was later disclosed that the settlement was about three times the initial offer from the <b>insurance</b> <b>company.</b> In 1999, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs established a scholarship to help children who lost a parent in the accident to take senior secondary and tertiary education.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the determinants of capital structure of <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> in Ghana. The study employed panel regression model in examining the capital structure of <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> in Ghana with financial statements of twelve <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> covering the period, 2002 - 2007. The results show that both the static trade-off and pecking order theories are important in explaining the capital structure of <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> in Ghana. Firm size, profitability and growth were statistically significant in relation to leverage. The positive relationship between firm size and leverage is an indication that, large <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> tend to employ more debt in their capital structure. This {{is because they are}} more diversified and have less probability of bankruptcy. The negative relationship between profitability and leverage is an indication that profitable <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> prefer internal sources of finance to external sources, hence less debt in their capital structure. However, the positive relationship between growth and leverage proves that growing <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> depend more on debt to finance their growth. These are very important variables influencing the financing decisions of <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> in Ghana. The other firm level variables were statistically insignificant...|$|R
