5|$|Eusebius {{listed the}} Gospel of the Hebrews in his Antilegomena {{as one of}} the disputed {{writings}} of the early Church. Despite this, the Church Fathers occasionally used it, with reservations, as a source to support their exegetical arguments. Eusebius reports that the 2nd century Church Father Hegesippus used the gospel as a source for writing his Hypomneumata ("Memoranda") in Rome (c.175–180). The Alexandrian Fathers – Clement, Origen, and <b>Didymus</b> the Blind – relied directly on the gospel to provide prooftexts as a supplement to the canonical gospels. Clement quoted from the gospel as part of a discourse on divine Wisdom. Origen used it to compare differing views {{of the relationship between the}} Word and the Holy Spirit. Jerome claimed to have used the gospel as a prooftext, although he may have relied in part on excerpts from the commentaries of Origen. He quoted from it as a proof from prophecy based on Isaiah11.2 to explain how Jesus was the fulfillment of messianic expectations. The Gospel of the Hebrews was excluded from the canon by the Catholic Church with the closing of the New Testament canon at the end of the 4th century, and was no longer cited as a source in Church literature.|$|E

25|$|The Copts in Egypt contributed immensely to Christian tradition. The Catechetical School of Alexandria was {{the oldest}} catechetical school in the world.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 408, as the Roman forces in Italy {{assembled}} to counterattack, Constantine had other plans. Fearful that several cousins of the Emperor Honorius in Hispania, which was a stronghold of the House of Theodosius and loyal to the ineffectual emperor, would organize an attack from that direction while troops under Sarus and Stilicho attacked him from Italy in a pincer maneuver, he struck first at Hispania. He summoned his eldest son Constans from the monastery where he was dwelling, elevated him to Caesar, or co-emperor, and sent him with the general Gerontius towards Hispania. The cousins of Honorius were defeated without much difficulty and two— <b>Didymus</b> and Verinianus — were captured, while two others — Lagodius and Theodosiolus — managed to escape.

25|$|The {{question}} also arises as {{to various}} sects' usage of other works attributed to Thomas and {{their relation to}} this work.

The Infancy Gospel of Thomas, shorn of its mythological connections, is difficult to connect specifically to our gospel, but the Acts of Thomas contains the Hymn of the Pearl whose content is reflected in the Psalms of Thomas found in Manichaean literature.

Sarah is assaulted by a group of creatures called Fireys with detachable body parts who try to remove her head, but Hoggle comes to her aid. She kisses him, and Jareth magically sends them to the Bog of Eternal Stench as punishment, where they reunite with Ludo. Sarah, Hoggle, and Ludo meet a guard of the bridge out of the swamp named Sir <b>Didymus,</b> an anthropomorphic fox, and his Old English Sheepdog [...] "steed" [...] named Ambrosius. After Ludo howls and summons a trail of rocks to save Sarah from falling into the bog, <b>Didymus</b> joins the group (her three new friends are just like some of the toys in her room).

500|$|It is {{the only}} Jewish–Christian gospel which the Church Fathers {{referred}} to by name, believing {{there was only one}} Hebrew Gospel, perhaps in different versions. Passages from the gospel were quoted or summarized by three Alexandrian Fathers – Clement, Origen and <b>Didymus</b> the Blind; it was also quoted by Jerome, either directly or through the commentaries of Origen. The gospel was used as a supplement to the canonical gospels to provide source material for their commentaries based on scripture. Eusebius included it in his list of disputed writings known as the Antilegomena, noting that it was used by [...] "Hebrews" [...] within the Church; it fell out of use when the New Testament canon was codified {{at the end of the}} 4th century.

500|$|There {{are some}} {{doubtful}} similarities between passages in the Johannine epistles and {{the writings of}} Polycarp and Papias, but the earliest definitive references to the epistles come from the late second century. Irenaeus in Adversus Haereses 3.16.8 (written c. 180), quotes 2 John 7 and 8, {{and in the next}} sentence 1 John 4:1, 2, but does not distinguish between 1 and 2 John; he does not quote from 3 John. The Muratorian Canon seems to refer to two letters of John only, though it is possible to interpret it as referring to three. [...] 1 John is extensively cited by Tertullian, who died in 215, and Clement of Alexandria, in addition to quoting 1 John, wrote a commentary on 2 John in his Adumbrationes. All three Johannine epistles were recognized by the 39th festal letter of Athanasius, the Synod of Hippo and the Council of Carthage. Additionally <b>Didymus</b> the Blind wrote a commentary on all three epistles, showing that by the early 5th century they were being considered as a single unit.|$|E
2500|$|Until recently, it {{was thought}} that no Greek Church Father had taken note of the passage before the 1100s. [...] However, in 1941 a large {{collection}} of the writings of <b>Didymus</b> the Blind (c. 313–398) was discovered in Egypt, in which <b>Didymus</b> states that [...] "We find in certain gospels" [...] an episode in which a woman was accused of a sin, and was about to be stoned, but Jesus intervened [...] "and said to those who were about to cast stones, ‘He who has not sinned, let him take a stone and throw it. [...] If anyone is conscious in himself not to have sinned, let him take a stone and smite her.’ [...] And no one dared," [...] and so forth. [...] This is far from a direct quotation, but it may be a loose summary of the episode. [...] Barring the possibility that <b>Didymus</b> was referring to some other Gospel than the four-Gospel collection that was typically used in the churches in his time, this reference appears to establish that the passage was present in its usual place in some Greek manuscripts known in Alexandria and elsewhere from the 300s onwards.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first four}} perfect numbers {{were the only}} ones known to early Greek mathematics, and the {{mathematician}} Nicomachus had noted 8128 as early as 100AD. Philo of Alexandria in his first-century book [...] "On the creation" [...] mentions perfect numbers, claiming that the world was created in 6 days and the moon orbits in 28 days because 6 and 28 are perfect. Philo is followed by Origen, and by <b>Didymus</b> the Blind, [...] who adds the observation that there are only four perfect numbers that are less than 10,000. (Commentary on Genesis 1. 14-19). St Augustine defines perfect numbers in City of God (Part XI, Chapter 30) in the early 5th century AD, repeating the claim that God created the world in 6 days because 6 is the smallest perfect number. The Egyptian mathematician Ismail ibn Fallūs (1194–1252) mentioned the next three perfect numbers (33,550,336, 8,589,869,056 and 137,438,691,328) and listed a few more which are now known to be incorrect. In a manuscript written between 1456 and 1461, an unknown mathematician recorded the earliest European reference to a fifth perfect number, with 33,550,336 being correctly identified for the first time. In 1588, the Italian mathematician Pietro Cataldi also identified the sixth (8,589,869,056) and the seventh (137,438,691,328) perfect numbers, and also proved that every perfect number obtained from Euclid's rule ends with a 6 or an 8.|$|E

2500|$|Early church commentaries {{are mixed}} with regard {{to whether or not}} Paul intends to condemn all {{homosexuality}} in these verses. Contemporary English translations imply that Rom 1:26b condemns lesbian sex, while 1:27 condemns sex between men. [...] However, several early church writers clearly state that Rom 1:26b is a condemnation of men having unnatural sex with women. [...] Brooten cites both Anastasios and Augustine as explicitly rejecting the 'lesbian hypothesis' (p.337). [...] Hanks asserts that [...] "not until John Chrysostom (ca 400 CE) does anyone (mis)interpret Romans 1:26 as referring to relations between two women" [...] (p.90). Townsley notes that other early writers, possibly including Chrysostom, reject the 'lesbian' hypothesis, specifically, Ambrosiaster, <b>Didymus</b> the Blind and Clement of Alexandria. Townsley goes on to specify the context of Rom 1:26-27 as the continuation of Paul's condemnation of the worship of pagan gods from earlier in the chapter, linking the 'homosexuality' implied in Rom 1:27 to the practice of temple prostitution with castrated priests of Cybele, practices condemned more explicitly in the Old Testament (1 Kings 15:12, 2 Kings 23:7), the same religious group that violently attacked Paul in Ephesus, driving him from the city (Acts 19). [...] The implication is that the goddess religions, the castrated priests and temple prostitution had a wide impact in ancient Mediterranean culture (similar to the devadasi system in India today) so would immediately evoke an image for the 1st century audience of non-Yahwistic religious idolatry, practices not familiar to the modern reader, which makes it easy to misinterpret these verses. On the other hand, Brooten notes that Clement of Alexandria likely interpreted Rom 1:27 as a condemnation of lesbians.|$|E

He early moulded my taste to the preference of Demosthenes to Cicero, of Homer and Theocritus to Virgil, and again of Virgil to Ovid. He habituated me to compare Lucretius, (in such extracts as I then read,) Terence, and above all the chaster poems of Catullus, {{not only with the}} Roman poets of the, so called, silver and brazen ages; but with even those of the Augustan aera: and on grounds of plain sense and universal logic to see and assert the superiority of the former in the truth and nativeness both of their thoughts and diction. At the same time that we were studying the Greek tragic poets, he made us read Shakespeare and Milton as lessons: and they were the lessons too, which required most time and trouble to bring up, so as to escape his censure. I learned from him, that poetry, even that of the loftiest and, seemingly, that of the wildest odes, had a logic of its own, as severe as that of science; and more difficult, because more subtle, more complex, and dependent on more, and more fugitive causes. In the truly great poets, he would say, there is a reason assignable, not only for every word, but for the position of every word; and I well remember that, availing himself of the synonymes to the Homer of <b>Didymus,</b> he made us attempt to show, with regard to each, why it would not have answered the same purpose; and wherein consisted the peculiar fitness of the word in the original text.|$|E
