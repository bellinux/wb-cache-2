5|$|The <b>depositions</b> that Hutchinson {{collected}} {{and sent to}} London were eventually published in a pamphlet entitled A Fair Account of the Late Unhappy Disturbance in Boston. Drawn mainly from <b>depositions</b> by soldiers, its account of affairs sought to blame selfish Bostonians for denying the validity of Parliamentary laws. It also blamed the city's hoodlums and gangs for the lawlessness preceding the event, and claimed that they set up an ambush of the soldiers. However, as it was not published until well after the first pamphlet had arrived in London, it ended up having a much smaller {{impact on the public}} debate there.|$|E
5|$|Anonymous {{pamphlets}} {{were published}} describing the event from significantly different perspectives. A Short Narrative of the Horrid Massacre, published {{under the auspices}} of the Boston town meeting, was principally written by James Bowdoin, a member of the governor's council and a vocal opponent of British colonial policy, along with Samuel Pemberton, and Joseph Warren. It described the shooting and other lesser incidents that took place in the days before as unprovoked attacks on peaceful, law-abiding inhabitants, and was, according to historian Neal Langley York, probably the most influential description of the event. The account it provided was drawn from more than 90 <b>depositions</b> taken after the event, and it included accusations that the soldiers sent by Captain Preston had been deployed with the intention of causing harm. In the interest of minimizing impact on the jury pool, city leaders held back local distribution of the pamphlet, but sent copies to other colonies and to London, where they knew <b>depositions</b> collected by Governor Hutchinson were en route. A second pamphlet, Additional Observations on the Short Narrative, furthered the attack on crown officials by complaining that customs officials (one of whom had left Boston to carry Hutchinson's gathered <b>depositions</b> to London) were abandoning their posts under the pretense that it was too dangerous for them to do their duties.|$|E
50|$|The {{manufacturing}} {{techniques for}} dielectric mirrors {{are based on}} thin-film <b>deposition</b> methods. Common techniques are physical vapor <b>deposition</b> (which includes evaporative <b>deposition</b> and ion beam assisted <b>deposition),</b> chemical vapor <b>deposition,</b> ion beam <b>deposition,</b> molecular beam epitaxy, and sputter <b>deposition.</b> Common materials are magnesium fluoride, silicon dioxide, tantalum pentoxide, zinc sulfide (n=2.32), and titanium dioxide (n=2.4).|$|R

40|$|AbstractA new {{particle}} <b>deposition</b> model, namely partial <b>deposition</b> model, {{is developed}} {{in order to}} improve the accuracy of prediction to particle <b>deposition.</b> Concepts of critical velocity and critical angle are proposed and used to determine whether particles are deposited or not. The comparison of numerical results calculated by partial <b>deposition</b> model and existing <b>deposition</b> model shows that the <b>deposition</b> distribution obtained by partial <b>deposition</b> model is more reasonable. Based on the predicted <b>deposition</b> results, the change of total pressure loss coefficient with operating time and the distribution of pressure coefficients on blade surface after 500 hours are predicted by using partial <b>deposition</b> model...|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Moscow Declaration, the Minister for External Affairs, Dr. H. V. Evatt, {{commissioned}} a report by William Webb on war crimes committed by the Japanese. Webb took <b>depositions</b> from three members of the 2/6th Independent Company about the Kaiapit incident which formed part of his report, which was submitted to the United Nations War Crimes Commission in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln hired John Kirby to {{represent}} Nintendo in court. Kirby had won other big cases {{for the likes}} of PepsiCo., General Foods, and Warner-Lambert. Kirby researched the game's development, taking <b>depositions</b> from designer Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi in Japan. Miyamoto claimed that he had in fact called his ape character King Kong at first, as that was a generic term in Japan for any large ape.|$|E
5|$|Some Anglo-Saxon kings {{are known}} to have been killed by their {{households}} or in open warfare against rivals, but overall the record is very sparse. The evidence as regards the deposition of kings is equally limited. Only two eighth-century <b>depositions</b> offer any context, those of Æthelwald Moll in Northumbria and Sigeberht of Wessex. In both cases the decision is presented as that of some form of council.|$|E

5|$|After the Navy {{closed its}} investigation, Thompson {{continued}} his own {{research into the}} explosion and its aftermath. Thompson was assisted by Snyder and other former Navy personnel, including Iowa crewmen and Navy headquarters staff members. Family members of the victims as well as staff members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees also helped Thompson. In addition, he obtained information via Freedom of Information Act requests to the Navy. Furthermore, Thompson accessed <b>depositions</b> taken from Navy leaders and investigators during {{a lawsuit against the}} Navy by Hartwig's family.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{fracturing}} {{process is}} not yet known, the altitudinal statistical analysis indicates that the caldera had formed just before the eruption. The area of the island was smaller, and the southern and eastern coastlines appeared regressed. During the eruption, the landscape was covered by the pumice sediments. In some places, the coastline vanished under thick tuff <b>depositions.</b> In others, recent coastlines were extended towards the sea. After the eruption, the geomorphology of the island was characterized by an intense erosional phase during which the pumice was progressively removed from the higher altitudes to the lower ones.|$|E
5|$|Macroolithus rugustus is {{abundant}} in the Nemegt Formation, which dates to the late Campanian to early Maastrichtian. This formation represents <b>depositions</b> of a meandering river. Well-preserved dinosaur remains are common in the Nemegt Formation, including oviraptorosaurs, titanosaurs, troodontids, tyrannosaurs, ankylosaurs, pachycephalosaurs, hadrosaurs, ornithomimosaurs, alvarezsaurs, and therizinosaurs. Remains of small animals are relatively rare, but several types of birds are known from Nemegt, {{as well as several}} types of multituberculate mammals. Other fossil eggs from the Nemegt Formation include Ovaloolithus, Spheroolithus, Elongatoolithus, and Laevisoolithus.|$|E

30|$|For the {{electrochemical}} <b>deposition</b> of metal onto macroporous Si, {{there are three}} typical <b>deposition</b> modes, which represent the <b>deposition</b> proceeding from pore bottom to pore opening [16, 26, 27], the <b>deposition</b> proceeding from the opening of pores [27], {{as well as the}} <b>deposition</b> occurring homogeneously on the entire surface of pore wall [16, 17]. The homogeneous <b>deposition</b> occurs only for the <b>deposition</b> of less noble metal, whereas no radial growth on sidewall has been found for the noble metals so far. Therefore, macroporous Si has not yet been employed as a template for {{the electrochemical}} <b>deposition</b> of noble metal tube.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The electrophoretic <b>deposition</b> of TiO 2 – {{iron oxide}} {{nanocrystal}} monolayers from stable, mixed colloidal suspensions by electrophoretic <b>deposition</b> using non polar solvents is reported.

5|$|On June 21, 2014, Solo {{was arrested}} and charged with two {{misdemeanor}} counts of assault in the fourth degree; one against her half-sister and the other against her nephew. She was booked under her married name of Hope Amelia Stevens. After pleading not guilty, she was released the following day. In August, her trial was scheduled for November 4, 2014, but this was later delayed until January 20, 2015. On December 30, 2014, the judge ordered more <b>depositions</b> from the defendants and delayed a decision on whether charges against Solo would be dropped until January 6, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Radiocarbon dating of {{the human}} remains {{suggested}} that some {{were brought to the}} site between either 3980–3800 calibrated BCE (95% probability) or 3960–3880 cal BCE (68% probability). It further suggested that after an interval of either 60–350 years (95% probability) or 140–290 years (68% probability), additional <b>depositions</b> of human remains were made inside the tomb. This second phase probably began in 3730–3540 cal BCE (95% probability) or 3670–3560 cal BCE (68% probability).|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{evidence}} submitted by the prosecution {{took the form of}} <b>depositions</b> made by leading Nazis. The defence demanded that the men should be brought to Israel so that the defence's right to cross-examination would not be abrogated. But Hausner, in his role as Attorney General, declared that he would be obliged to have any war criminals who entered Israel arrested. The prosecution proved that Eichmann had visited places where exterminations had taken place, including Chełmno extermination camp, Auschwitz, and Minsk (where he witnessed a mass shooting of Jews), and therefore was aware that the deportees were being killed.|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{of sulfur}} and {{nitrogen}} <b>deposition</b> {{by means of}} the throughfall method are compared with model estimates. The sulfur model appears to estimate <b>deposition</b> to deciduous forests very well, but underestimates <b>deposition</b> to conifers by 30 to 40 %. The NH 4 -N <b>deposition</b> to forest is underestimated by the applied model. The model predictions of NO 3 -N <b>deposition</b> do not show any bias against observations, but are not better correlated with observations than NH 4 calculations. Reduced nitrogen compounds are the dominant nitrogen form in throughfall in ammonia polluted areas and contribute up to 50 % of the total nitrogen <b>deposition</b> in other areas. <b>Deposition</b> of alkaline material to forests is estimated by applying different methods. Basic cation <b>deposition</b> neutralizes about 31 % of the acid sulfur <b>deposition</b> to forest, on the average. Because of the large spatial variability of base cation <b>deposition,</b> it is recommended to develop a model for atmospheric transport and <b>deposition</b> of calcium- and magnesium-bearing particles...|$|R
40|$|For {{powering}} small-sized electronic devices, all-solid-state Li-ion {{batteries are}} the most promising candidates due to its safety and allowing miniaturization.

5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic surge (or base surge), a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with the eruption column. Base surges are caused by the gravitational collapse of a vaporous eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to the vent, resulting a wedge shape. Associated with these laterally moving rings are dune-shaped <b>depositions</b> of rock left behind by the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common surge indicator.|$|E
5|$|In the east, Selvo {{not only}} {{maintained}} good {{trade relations with}} the Byzantine Empire, but also married into their royal family to consolidate the alliance that had existed for many years between the two nations. In 1075, Selvo married Teodora Ducas, daughter of Constantine X and sister of the reigning emperor, Michael VII. Though Venetians, especially the nobles, were wary of the pageantry that accompanied the marriage and the royal bride, the strengthened alliance meant even greater mobility for Venetian merchants in the east. Though {{the popularity of the}} new dogaressa was not great, Selvo was the hero of the merchant class that had had even greater political sway since the <b>depositions</b> of the Orseoli.|$|E
5|$|Justinian's {{first and}} second <b>depositions</b> were {{followed}} by internal disorder, with successive revolts and emperors lacking legitimacy or support. In this climate, the Umayyads consolidated their control of Armenia and Cilicia, and began preparing a renewed offensive against Constantinople. In Byzantium, the general Leo the Isaurian (r. 717–741) had just seized the throne in March 717, when the massive Muslim army under the famed Umayyad prince and general Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik began moving towards the imperial capital. The Caliphate's army and navy, led by Maslama, numbered some 120,000 men and 1,800 ships according to the sources. Whatever the real number, {{it was a huge}} force, far larger than the imperial army. Thankfully for Leo and the Empire, the capital's sea walls had recently been repaired and strengthened. In addition, the emperor concluded an alliance with the Bulgar khan Tervel, who agreed to harass the invaders' rear.|$|E
30|$|Because <b>deposition</b> is a process, {{the amount}} of {{deposited}} pollen on a surface at time t is the integrated <b>deposition</b> over the time period {{from the start of}} pollen shedding until time t. This <b>deposition</b> process is expressed by the integral of <b>deposition</b> over this time period and can be calculated on a daily time scale using the respective cumulative daily <b>deposition</b> rates (10).

40|$|Ion <b>deposition</b> in {{the open}} field and under the canopy was {{monitored}} in 13 CONECOFOR plots during 1998 - 2005. In spite of the remote location of most plots, atmospheric <b>deposition</b> carries considerable amounts of anthropogenic ions (sulphate, nitrate and ammonium). <b>Deposition</b> acidity is buffered by the <b>deposition</b> of base cations, partially due to the long-range transport of Saharan dust.

40|$|Increases and {{expansion}} of anthropogenic emissions of both oxidized nitrogen compounds, NO(x, a) nd a reduced nitrogen compound, NH 3, have driven an increase in nitrogen <b>deposition.</b> We estimate global NO x and NH 3 emissions and use {{a model of the}} global troposphere, MOGUNTIA, to examine the pre-industrial and contemporary quantities and spatial patterns of wet and dry NOy and NHx <b>deposition.</b> Pre-industrial wet plus dry NO x and NHx <b>deposition</b> was greatest for tropical ecosystems, related to soil emissions, biomass burning and lightning emissions. Contemporary NOy + NHx wet and dry <b>deposition</b> onto Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperate ecosystems averages more than four times that of pre-industrial N <b>deposition</b> and far exceeds contemporary tropical N <b>deposition.</b> All temperate and tropical biomes receive more N via <b>deposition</b> today than pre-industrially. Comparison of contemporary wet <b>deposition</b> model estimates to measurements of wet <b>deposition</b> reveal that modeled and measured wet <b>deposition</b> for both NO 3 - and NH 4 + were quite similar over the U. S. Over Western Europe, the model tended to underestimate wet <b>deposition</b> of NO 3 + and NH 4 + but bulk <b>deposition</b> measurements were comparable to modeled total <b>deposition.</b> For the U. S. and Western Europe, we also estimated N emission and <b>deposition</b> budgets. In the U. S., estimated emissions exceed interpolated total <b>deposition</b> by 3 - 6 Tg N, suggesting that substantial N is transported offshore and/or the remote and rural location of the sites may fail to capture the <b>deposition</b> of urban emissions. In Europe, by contrast, interpolated total N <b>deposition</b> balances estimated emissions within the uncertainty of each. [References: 94...|$|R
5|$|Later, the Australian Minister for External Affairs, Dr. H. V. Evatt, {{commissioned}} {{a report by}} William Webb on war crimes committed by the Japanese. Webb took <b>depositions</b> about the Milne Bay incident {{from members of the}} Allied forces who had been present, and used them to form part of his report. In 1944 this was submitted to the United Nations War Crimes Commission, which had been set up by the Allies following the Moscow Declaration. Evidence about the crimes was presented to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal on 2 January 1947, but no Japanese personnel were prosecuted for actions during the fighting at Milne Bay.|$|E
5|$|Other offices {{included}} the sworn clerks, the examiners, the clerk to the barons, and the clerk to the King's Remembrancer. There were eight sworn clerks, so called {{because they were}} sworn officers of the court, who held their offices for life and worked under the Remembrancer. Each clerk acted as {{an attorney for the}} parties in court, and every party was required to employ one. The first clerk was known as the First Secondary, and administered oaths out of the Red Book of the Exchequer. The sworn clerks were assisted by 24side clerks, of whom each sworn clerk appointed three. Each side clerk studied under a sworn clerk for five years before practising himself, although under the sworn clerk's name. A side clerk had the chance of being promoted to sworn clerk, first by the Remembrancer and then by the sworn clerks themselves. The examiners were tasked with supervising <b>depositions</b> of witnesses, bringing the witness to a Baron, administering the oath and keeping the files of the <b>depositions.</b> In 1624 it was decided these examiners should be sworn officers of the court, and from then on each Baron had an examiner, who acted in the Baron's name. The office of examiner was dissolved in 1841, when the equity jurisdiction of the Exchequer came to an end. In addition to an examiner, each Baron had at least one clerk, who acted as their private secretary; although not paid, they were authorised to take fees for their work. The Chief Baron had two clerks, while the puisne Barons had one each. The King's Remembrancer also employed a clerk, who was also a secretary. He received no salary and was not a sworn officer of the court, meaning the Remembrancer could have him replaced at any time.|$|E
5|$|The USPTO will {{contact the}} senior {{registrant}} to inform that {{party of the}} claim against their mark.

The senior registrant may present evidence to the contrary, {{in order to prevent}} the loss of control over the use of the registered mark in the applicant's claimed territory. Both parties may take discovery in the form of requests for admission, interrogatories, requests for production, and <b>depositions.</b> As with a regular trial, the TTAB may be called upon to resolve disputes over whether discovery requests are overbroad, and whether discovery responses are inadequate.|$|E
