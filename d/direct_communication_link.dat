40|$|Abstract—Shamir’s (n,k) {{threshold}} {{secret sharing}} is an impor-tant component of several cryptographic protocols, {{such as those}} for secure multiparty-computation. These protocols typically assume the presence of <b>direct</b> <b>communication</b> <b>links</b> from the dealer to all participants, {{in which case the}} dealer can directly pass the shares of the secret to every participant. In this paper, we consider the problem of secret sharing when the dealer does not have <b>direct</b> <b>communication</b> <b>links</b> to all participants, and instead, they form a general network. We present an algorithm for secret sharing over networks that satisfy what we call the k-propagating-dealer condition. The algorithm is communication-efficient, distributed and deterministic. Interestingly, the solution constitutes an instance of a network coding problem admitting a distributed and deterministic solution, and furthermore, handles the case of nodal-eavesdropping, about which very little appears to be known in the literature. In {{the second part of the}} paper, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on the communication complexity of secret sharing over any network, which may also be of independent interest. We show that for networks satisfying the k-propagating-dealer condition, the communication complexity of our algorithm is Θ(n), and furthermore, is always within a constant factor of the lower bound. We also show that, in contrast, existing solutions in the literature entail a communication-complexity that is super-linear for a wide class of networks, and is Θ(n 2) in the worst case. Our algorithm thus allows for efficient generalization of several cryptographic protocols to a large class of networks. I...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{cognitive}} radio (CR) is a promising concept {{to improve the}} radio spectrum exploitation. CR has tremendous ability to enhance spectrum efficiency by allowing secondary users (SUs) to access licensed radio spectrum resource which is currently not being used by primary users (PUs). One basic challenge of that paradigm is securing the quality of service (QoS) of the primary link transmission while increasing {{the rate of the}} secondary links transmission. Cooperative relaying is an encouraging technology which offers the opportunity to maximize the transmission diversity gain significantly in the rapid development growth of wireless communication which contains {{cognitive radio}} networks. On the other hand, effective capacity (EC) which is designed to provide a maximum constant arrival rate that a statistical wireless channels can support while satisfying statistical QoS requirements. In this thesis, the performance enhancement analysis of cognitive radio relay network (CRRN) by exploiting the <b>direct</b> <b>communication</b> <b>link</b> has been investigated in Rayleigh fading channel where peak interference power constraint is taken into consider. A spectrum sharing technique is considered in this thesis where a restriction of spectrum sharing is applied by the PUs. Here, an SU can coexist simultaneously with the PU for transmitting data as long as a certain threshold on the peak interference power applied on the primary receiver is not overstepped by the SUs transmission. In addition, it is supposed that there are multiple intermediate relay nodes available to transmit their signal to the destination along with a <b>direct</b> <b>communication</b> <b>link</b> for secondary transmission. Moreover, the SU transmission has to meet a random delay QoS constraint. By providing this QoS constraint, the maximum arrival data rate of SUs can be achieved with small error of probability. Specifically, this thesis also acquires closed-form expressions of EC for CRRN. It is evident that if the channel quality and the interference threshold set by the PU are changed, then the capacity of the channel is also to be changed. In addition, it is also verified that the <b>direct</b> <b>communication</b> <b>link</b> together with multiple relay nodes has significantly higher capacity gains compare to non-direct communication link for CRRN. Matlab simulations are presented to find out theoretical results and Monte-Carlo simulations are carried out to support these numerical results. Both the simulation results and the analytical results match very well. Phone No. : + 46 - 761859111 Email: rochepacific@yahoo. com mabu 09 @student. bth. s...|$|E

30|$|In this section, {{we propose}} two {{scheduling}} algorithms {{applicable to the}} hybrid polling method: the packet-level and the connection-level scheduling algorithms. By performing the packet-level scheduling algorithm {{at the beginning of}} DCPIs, the AP can schedule efficiently the direct data transmissions requested on a packet basis. The connection-level scheduling algorithm derives the polling sequence for granting the transmission opportunities to the transmitting STAs of all existing established direct link connections. When polling the STAs in DCPIs, by a simple method, the AP modifies the polling sequence derived by the connection-level scheduling algorithm considering the information of the STAs' requests for the <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> <b>communication.</b> The connection-level scheduling algorithm is suitable for the case when the AP cannot perform the packet-level scheduling algorithm quickly enough to reflect exactly the STAs' new requests for the <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> <b>communication</b> in the next DCPI. However, in the cases where the connectivity and interference information and the information of the STAs' requests for the <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> <b>communication</b> do not change {{for a period of time}} during which the AP can derive the polling sequence by the packet-level scheduling algorithm or a small number of STAs actually request the <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> <b>communication,</b> the packet-level scheduling algorithm should be applied for the efficient use of the wireless bandwidth. Note that when no STA requests the <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> <b>communication,</b> the next DCPI will be skipped.|$|R
