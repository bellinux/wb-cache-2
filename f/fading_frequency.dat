40|$|A new joint signal {{detection}} and channel parameter estimation scheme is proposed for multiple subcarrier signaling with pilot symbol-assisted modulation (PSAM) schemes. The proposed scheme estimates {{a pair of}} parameters associated with the generation process of the <b>fading</b> <b>frequency</b> selectivity, which is common to all the subcarriers. This parameter estimation can effectively extract information regarding the <b>fading</b> <b>frequency</b> selectivity through the pilot symbols received {{not only by the}} subcarrier of interest, but by other ones as well. The fading complex envelope with each subcarrier is derived from the estimates of the parameter pair. With the proposed scheme, performances are evaluated through simulations and are compared with the performance of a subcarrier-by-subcarrier detection scheme...|$|E
30|$|Under block <b>fading</b> <b>frequency</b> {{selective}} channel hypothesis, and GA assumption on {{the detector}} output, the analytical signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) {{is equivalent to}} the SNR when the transmission is done through an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Hence, for HSUPA performance prediction over block <b>fading</b> <b>frequency</b> selective channel, FPP makes use of the analytical SINR with previously stored look-up tables (LUT). These tables are built with a turbo coded HSUPA simulator over AWGN channel. The rest of this article is organized as follows: HSUPA system model is described in Section 2. The FPP with TPC and Hybrid-ARQ Chase combining is introduced in Section 3. The impact of channel estimation on performance prediction is presented in Section 4.

25|$|Frequency (subcarrier) {{interleaving}} increases {{resistance to}} frequency-selective channel {{conditions such as}} fading. For example, when {{a part of the}} channel bandwidth <b>fades,</b> <b>frequency</b> interleaving ensures that the bit errors that would result from those subcarriers in the faded part of the bandwidth are spread out in the bit-stream rather than being concentrated. Similarly, time interleaving ensures that bits that are originally close together in the bit-stream are transmitted far apart in time, thus mitigating against severe fading as would happen when travelling at high speed.|$|R

For lower signal-to-noise ratios and/or smaller modulation depths it also provides a non-iterative method of retrieving the input signal...|$|R

However, when the primary user signal spectrum exhibits localized fading, PU detection cannot be guaranteed. In addition, as the CR may use the PU <b>faded</b> <b>frequencies,</b> the PU spectrum can be disturbed by a narrow-band interference (NBI) and synchronization algorithms used for the PU carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation suffer degradations.

40|$|The affect {{associated}} with negative (or unpleasant) memories typically tends to fade {{faster than the}} affect {{associated with}} positive (or pleasant) memories, a phenomenon called the fading affect bias (FAB). We conducted a study to explore the mechanisms related to the FAB. A retrospective recall procedure was used to obtain three self-report measures (memory vividness, rehearsal <b>frequency,</b> affective <b>fading)</b> for both positive events and negative events. Affect for positive events faded less than affect for negative events, and positive events were recalled more vividly than negative events. The perceived vividness of an event (memory vividness) {{and the extent to}} which an event has been rehearsed (rehearsal frequency) were explored as possible mediators of the relation between event valence and affect fading. Additional models conceived of affect <b>fading</b> and rehearsal <b>frequency</b> as contributors to a memory’s vividness.
