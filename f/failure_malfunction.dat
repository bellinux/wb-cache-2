50|$|The {{most common}} data {{recovery}} scenario involves an operating system <b>failure,</b> <b>malfunction</b> of a storage device, logical failure of storage devices, accidental damage or deletion, etc. (typically, on a single-drive, single-partition, single-OS system), {{in which case}} the ultimate goal is simply to copy all important files from the damaged media to another new drive. This can be easily accomplished using a Live CD, many of which provide a means to mount the system drive and backup drives or removable media, and to move the files from the system drive to the backup media with a file manager or optical disc authoring software. Such cases can often be mitigated by disk partitioning and consistently storing valuable data files (or copies of them) on a different partition from the replaceable OS system files.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The {{paper is}} aimed to {{establish}} the dependence {{of changes in the}} time domain and spectral components of the current in the circuit of the AC electric point motor on its technical condition, to identify the common features for the same type of damage. It is necessary using the analysis of the received signals to carry out the remote diagnosis and determination of faults and defects of electric point motors. In addition it suggested to accelerate the process of the <b>failure,</b> <b>malfunction</b> and damage search. Authors propose the automated approach to the service of remote floor automation equipment, which is located in the envelope of trains. Reduction of the threat to life and health of staff by reducing the residence time in the zone of train movement. Reduce the impact of human factors on the result of service. Methodology. The paper studies the structure, parameters and characteristics, the operation and maintenance characteristics of the AC electric point motors. Determination of the main types of possible faults in the process depending on the operating conditions. Presentation of the electric motor as an object of diagnosis. Findings. The time dependences of the current in the circuit of electric point motor for its various states was obtained. The connection between the technical condition of electric point motor and the performance of current curve in time and spectral domains was established. The revealed deviations from the reference signal were justified. According to the obtained results it was made the conclusion. Originality. A method for diagnosing the state of the AC electric point motor by the time dependence and the spectral composition of the current in its circuit was proposed. The connection diagram to the motor windings based on non-infringement of electric parameters of connection circuit in the actual operating conditions was applied. Practical value. The obtained results suggest the possibility and feasibility of further development of the principles of remote diagnosis based on the analysis of temporal and spectral domains of the current curve in the circuit of the AC electric point motor. The implementation and practical application in operation as a separate system for the collection, analysis, processing and data communication is also real and rational. The given system makes possible tracking the changes in key parameters and forming the proposals on impact measures on the existing situation, as well as the ability to predict the state of the objects {{on the basis of the}} dependency determination of the previous changes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Power system {{harmonics}} cause {{many problems}} like equipment <b>failures,</b> <b>malfunctions</b> and plant shutdowns. Accordingly, mitigation of these harmonics {{is considered an}} important target especially for the industrial applications where any short downtime period may lead to great economic losses. There are at least ten different mitigation techniques to choose from, each with specific technical advantages and disadvantages. Comparative studies for the harmonic mitigation techniques in industrial electrical systems are rarely {{found in the literature}} even though they are strongly needed. This paper, almost for the first time, provides comprehensive technical comparisons between the various practical harmonics mitigation techniques in the industrial electrical systems. This has been carried out with the aid of our research and experience in the industrial field. Hence, this paper is considered as a helpful guide for design engineers, consultants and customers of the industrial sector...|$|R

30|$|The {{conventional}} SSCS takes {{charge of}} the stability of a regional power grid, usually restricting the control range in a provincial grid. Distributed in a regional power grid, the early SSCS made decisions independently and took appropriate measures against failures listed in the control strategy. With the development of EHV AC/DC transmission network, strong electrical connection will be established between regional power grids. It may occur that the operation of some SSCS in region A becomes a disturbance to the SCCS in region B, though the operation is correct for the stability problems caused by faults in region A [35]. For example, the rapid and large-scale transfer of load flow caused by generator tripping or separation in region A can lead to action <b>failures,</b> <b>malfunctions</b> or unexpected actions of the SSCS in region B. Therefore, {{in order to prevent}} such hidden failures, the coordination between SSCSs in different regions must be considered and attached importance to.|$|R

30|$|Since the {{selected}} CHs are SNs that {{are prone to}} <b>failure</b> and <b>malfunction,</b> the fault tolerance property is indispensable in WSNs, especially in non-hostile and harsh environment [20]. In order to bypass node(s) failure that is always the case in WSNs, a re-clustering strategy is proposed. To achieve fault tolerance through re-clustering, we select alternative CHs and plan the itinerary among them using MST. This way, an alternative itineraries for MAs is planned in case the first ones fail.|$|R
