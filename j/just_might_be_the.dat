500|$|On the {{negative}} side, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said that [...] "even by the crude standards of teenage horror, Final Destination is dramatically flat". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post commented that [...] "the film's premise quickly deteriorates into a silly, badly acted slasher movie—minus the slasher". Kevin Maynard of Mr. Showbiz described {{the film as}} [...] "crude and witless", while Rita Kempley of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "your own final destination <b>just</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> box office, to demand your money back".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} a somewhat positive reaction from reviewers. IGN Robert Canning was representative of this, {{and gave it}} a [...] "good" [...] rating of 7.5 out of 10: [...] "The episode as a whole was fine for what it was, touching on most of the hallmarks of a decent prom episode", though he [...] "was a bit let down by the final moments of the episode as [...] felt it too quickly tried to pin a happy ending on everything". He also called the drama around Rachel and Jesse and Quinn and Finn [...] "superficial stuff", a view shared by Meghan Brown of The Atlantic who said much of the drama [...] "felt shallow and forced", except for the first Kurt and Karofsky scene, which she described as [...] "painful and poignant". Brown's colleague, Kevin Fallon, stated that [...] "Like prom, this episode was Glee at its best and its worst", and MTV Aly Semigran thought that it [...] "wasn't as strong—or cohesive—as last week's 'Rumours, but said it [...] "certainly had its moments, especially some notably hilarious ones." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "If the entirety of this show were like the last 10 minutes of this episode, it <b>just</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best show on TV." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics, with several reviewers dubbing {{it one of}} the worst episodes of the series. Francis Dass of the New Straits Times Press referred to it as [...] "one of the weaker episodes" [...] of the fifth season. The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Schizogeny" [...] a D–, and wrote that [...] "'Schizogeny' <b>just</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> very worst episode of The X-Files", noting that [...] "the tone [...] is off." [...] Furthermore, VanDerWerff felt that [...] "the more Scott and Wollaeger try to continue explaining this and tie it into the idea of child abuse, the less it attains any of the power or tragedy they want it to have." [...] Starpulse, in a run-down of the best and worst episodes and villains of the series, named the killer trees the worst monster-of-the-week and wrote, [...] " [...] proved that even the X-Files writers can come up completely dry on their scary creeps sometimes." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode 4/10, and, while praising the [...] "interesting concept" [...] of the episode, concluded that it was filled with [...] "odd inconsistencies, [...] is definitely not one of the better episodes of the season." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. [...] The two wrote positively of {{the first part of the}} episode noting that [...] "director Ralph Hemecker [...] the eeriness to the fore, and [...] this a more honest-to-truth scary slice of X-File than has been offered in ages." [...] Shearman and Pearson, however, argued that the episode's references to Psycho and its [...] "lack of explanation" [...] result in the episode approaching [...] "nonsense." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She wrote that, [...] "the plot of 'Schizogeny' is more tangled than the episode's paranormal root system, but underneath lies some powerful themes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Food & Liquor {{received}} widespread acclaim {{from music}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 83, based on 20 reviews. Several writers lauded the lyrical content on the album. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club praised the album, saying that Fiasco [...] "masterfully melds his peerless storytelling gifts with his idiosyncratic passion for skateboarding, fantasy, and incisive sociopolitical commentary". He {{also noted that}} Fiasco [...] "boldly expand the parameters of mainstream hip-hop". Sarah Godfrey of The Washington Post hailed the album as a [...] "masterpiece of responsible rap". Darryl Sterdan of Jam! called the album [...] "one of the sharpest and smartest hip-hop discs" [...] of 2006, while Andy Kellman of AllMusic argued that [...] "Food and Liquor <b>just</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> steadiest and most compelling rap album of 2006". Stylus Magazines Josh Love felt that it benefits greatly from Fiasco's impressive rapping and subtlety, which he found to be characteristics that are [...] "incredibly rare in hip-hop in 2006". Sean Fennessey of Pitchfork was less enthusiastic and said that although Fiasco's raps are abundant with [...] "wit and double meaning", the album's biggest flaw is his inability to write memorable hooks, which are instead [...] "blandly-sung, unmemorable couplets".|$|E

About.com gave it {{four out of}} five stars, stating [...] "with his swagger-jacking charm on the microphone, and enough charisma to convince you that he's really running things in his department, he <b>just</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Jay-Z of the south. King is not only T.I.'s most captivating album so far, it's probably the best thing {{to come out of the}} [...] "A-Town" [...] lately. And, as Pimp C explains on one of the album's many skits, a [...] "king" [...] is anyone that handles his business appropriately on the lyrical side of things, and many kings abound in southern rap. With such foraying display of bravado, T.I. has rightfully earned his membership to hip-hop's elite. Royal salute!" [...] Allmusic writer Andy Kellman gave the album a 4.5 out of 5 praising the album's lead single [...] "What You Know", and stating [...] "T.I.'s fourth album isn't the leap forward he's been threatening to make, but it does carry the best set of productions he has been given to work with, and it guarantees that he won't be leaving the singles charts any time soon." [...] Blender Magazine noted on T.I.'s status saying [...] "Before his album sold a surprise half a million copies in its first week of release, T.I. was a Southern star who didn’t quite feel like one: He made up with irresistible hooks what he lacked in personality. Now he’s a national star who doesn’t quite feel like one. A breezily charismatic drug rapper, he’s like Jay-Z without the worldview, Young Jeezy without the gravitas; he still hasn’t distinguished himself as an artist worth exploring past the singles. Thankfully, he’s packed album No. 4 full of singles, which might be just as good. His sonorous, self-assured drawl adds an air of unflustered authority to his alpha brags, and he pours it into unexpected patterns. What he’s best at is craft—woozy refrains and hypnotic rhyme schemes—and his fleet of beats is impeccable, highlighted by the four-minute epic “What You Know,” which laces imperious synths with an intriguing wistfulness. Throughout, producers Just Blaze, Swizz Beatz and DJ Toomp back T.I.’s self-deifying spiels with wild bombast: he’d seem a lot less kingly if it weren’t for his court." ...|$|E
