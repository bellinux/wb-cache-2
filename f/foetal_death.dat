40|$|Objective: A {{history of}} <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> {{is a risk}} factor for {{complications}} and <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> in subsequent pregnancies as most previous risk factors remain present and an underlying cause of death may recur. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate subsequent pregnancy outcome after <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> and to compare cases of recurrent <b>foetal</b> <b>death.</b> Study design: A retrospective cohort study in a tertiary referral centre. All women with a stillbirth beyond 16 weeks of gestation between January 1999 and December 2004 (n = 193) were identified. After providing informed consent, the medical records of 163 women were reviewed until August 2006 in terms of clinical, medical, obstetric and paediatric data of the pregnancy after the index pregnancy that resulted in <b>foetal</b> <b>death.</b> The cause of death for reported cases of <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> and recurrent <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> were classified by a multidisciplinary team according to the Tulip classification. Results: Recurrent <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> occurred in 11 cases, and various causes were identified. The cause of death was explained in seven cases. An association was found between the index <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> and subsequent <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> in some cases, especially in early gestation. Conclusions: This study illustrates the importance of classifying the cause of recurrent <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> and contributing risk factors using the same classification system. This provides more insight into the pathophysiological pathways leading to <b>foetal</b> <b>death,</b> and enables meaningful comparisons to be made in recurrent <b>foetal</b> <b>death.</b> This is required before preventive strategies can be instituted and implemented to reduce the risk of <b>foetal</b> <b>death.</b> (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|International audienceThe Nc-Spain 1 H isolate of Neospora caninum, {{which was}} newly {{obtained}} from the brain of a congenitally asymptomatic infected calf, demonstrated a reduced in vitro tachyzoite yield and viability rate, as well as low virulence in mouse models. The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine the ability of this isolate to induce <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> in a pregnant bovine model. For this purpose, 13 naïve pregnant heifers were divided into three groups and were experimentally challenged with either 107 tachyzoites of Nc- 1 (group 1, n =  5), Nc-Spain 1 H (group 2, n =  5) isolates or phosphate-buffered saline (group 3, n =  3) intravenously at 70 days of gestation. After inoculation, pregnancy was monitored and dams were sacrificed when <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> was detected. The remaining animals were slaughtered at 45 days post-infection. Maternal and foetal samples were collected for examination by histology and parasite DNA detection. Parasitaemia, specific anti-N. caninum IgG and interferon γ responses were also studied. At 3 - 4 weeks after infection, <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> was detected in 3 out of 5 Nc- 1 -infected dams. However, no evidence of <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> was observed in either Nc-Spain 1 H-infected or control groups during the period studied.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} {{maternal}} and neonatal outcomes, {{and management of}} single <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> in twin pregnancies. DATA SOURCES: Medline literature search (1950 to 1999) and hospital audit of single antepartum foetal deaths in twin pregnancy from 1993 through 1997. DATA SELECTION: Key words for literature search: twin pregnancy/pregnancies; single fetal death/demise. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted and reviewed independently by the authors. DATA SYNTHESIS: During the study period, 182 (0. 76 %) of 23, 804 deliveries involved twin pregnancies. Seven (3. 8 %) of the twin pregnancies were complicated {{by the death of}} one foetus. Single <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> in a twin pregnancy in the late second and third trimesters is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in the surviving co-twin, especially in a pregnancy involving monochorionic twins. Management should be individualised; conservative management is preferred by most obstetricians.

40|$|Summary. The {{negative}} correlation {{between the number of}} foetuses and the length of gestation characteristic of most multiparous species is not found in the pig. This observation, reported in previous studies, was confirmed using 1450 records from the Duroc and Hampshire breeds. The gestation period was also unrelated to either the number oflate <b>foetal</b> <b>deaths</b> or to the weight and fatness of the sow but prolonged gestation at first parturition reduced the probability of a second litter. Biggers, Curnow, Finn & McLaren (1963) have pointed out that the duration of gestation varies inversely with the number of foetuses in mice, guinea-pigs, cattle, sheep, goats, rabbits and humans. None of the seven studies on ges¬ tation period in pigs, cited by these authors, showed any significant relation¬ ship between the number born and the length of gestation. The purpose of this brief report is to substantiate the existing evidence in the pig and to examine other sources of variation among 1450 gestation periods observed in 693 purebred Duroc and Hampshire sows...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} current syphilis as {{a risk factor for}} <b>foetal</b> <b>death.</b> METHODS: Sera were obtained from 57 women with third trimester <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> (cases) and 58 women with foetus alive (controls) matched for age and parity. All sera reactive in qualitative Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) analyses were tested with serial twofold dilutions to determine endpoint flocculation titres and tested with the micro-haemagglutination assay for Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP). Placental biopsies were sectioned and stained by haematoxylin-eosin and Warthin-Starry for light microscopy. SETTING: Central Hospital, in Maputo, Mozambique, from January 1990 to June 1991. RESULTS: The MHA-TP was reactive in 42 % of cases and in 12 % of controls (OR = 5. 3; 95 % CI: 1. 9 - 15. 4). The RPR card test was reactive at the dilution of 1. 32 or greater in 28 % of cases and in 7 % of controls. All these results were confirmed by MHA-TP (OR = 5. 3; 95 % CI: 1. 5 - 15. 4). In 9 / 28 (32 %) MHA-TP seroreactive women (7 cases and 2 controls) placental morphological changes indicated syphilitic infection.

The present study was done to determine the probable etiology for antepartum and intrapartum foetal deaths and to study the role of antenatal care in prevention of intrauterine foetal deaths. Methods: The cases of intrauterine foetal deaths in OBGY department at MGM hospital, Kalamboli and Kamothe with either ultrasound reports proving Intrauterine <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> (IUFD) or diagnosed on clinical examination by absence of foetal heart rate with gestational age more than 28 weeks by dating from Naegle's rule or by ultrasonography were studied. Inclusion criteria includes as following; 1) All cases of IUFD > 28 weeks of gestation; 2) Baby weight of 1000 grams or more and exclusion criteria includes molar pregnancy. Results: The <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> rate was 27. 76 / 1000 births. Major causes of IUFD were PE and eclampsia (34. 78 %), unexplained (14. 49 %) and abruptio placentae (7. 25 %). Majority of the stillbirth were seen in preterm pregnancy between 34 - 36 (18. 85 %) weeks followed by 28 - 30 weeks (17. 39 %). Majority of foetuses were preterm and of birth weight between 1 - 1. 5 kg (28. 26 %) followed by 1. 5 - 2 kg (26. 09 %). Conclusions: Present studies showed that majority of IUFDs were preventable.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the timing of foetal mortality in gilts of a segregating F 2 cross of Large White and Meishan pigs on the basis of the length distribution of mummified foetuses and the frequency of non-fresh stillborn piglets in order to establish whether critical periods for foetal mortality exist. All expelled conceptuses and placentae of 192 farrowing gilts with a normal health status were meticulously investigated to recover all mummified foetuses. The length of each mummified foetus was measured. The predicted number of foetuses present per gilt at the early foetal stage of gestation was calculated as the sum of numbers of mummified foetuses and non-fresh stillborn, fresh stillborn and liveborn piglets. Foetal loss was calculated as the sum of mummified foetuses and non-fresh stillborn piglets. The average foetal mortality rate per gilt was 8. 7 %. In total 162 mummified foetuses were found (average 0. 84 per litter), ranging in length from 0. 4 to 33. 0 cm. This indicates a range in <b>foetal</b> age at <b>death</b> of similar to 35 - 100 days. Although mummified foetuses of all lengths within the above mentioned range were found, relatively many had a length of less than 4 cm or of 10 - 21 cm. The total number of non-fresh stillborn piglets (i. e. late <b>foetal</b> <b>deaths)</b> was 58 (average 0. 30 per litter). It can be concluded that foetal mortality occurred in these gilts throughout the period from day 35 to term, with relatively high incidences at the early foetal stage (days 35 - 40), shortly after mid-pregnancy (days 55 - 75) and after similar today 100 of gestation.

To determine whether non-specific depression or stimulation of the maternal immune system affects {{the success of the}} foetoplacental allograft, groups of virgin Fischer (Ag-B 1) females of similar age and weight mated with DA (Ag-B 4) males were treated with daily intraperitoneal injections of: (a) saline, (b) methylprednisolone (MP), 1 - 0 mg/kg, (c) cyclophosphamide (CY), 3. 0 mg/kg, or (d) azathioprine (AZ), 3. 0 mg/kg; or they were injected intraperitoneally on the fifth day of gestation with: (a) B. pertussis, 1. 0 ml, (b) C. parvum, 0. 2 ml, or (c) BCG, 0. 1 ml. None of the immunostimulating agents were detrimental to the progeny, but the immunosupprissive drugs caused an increased percentage of <b>foetal</b> <b>deaths</b> and foetoplacental growth retardation. The reduced foetal and placental size induced by CY or AZ could be partially blocked by simultaneous maternal treatment with BCG. Analysis of mean maternal weight gain, spleen weight assays, changes in the lymph nodes draining the uterus and comparison of data from non-pregnant animals and syngeneic pregnancies treated with these agents suggest that immunosuppressive drugs reduce foetal survival rates and produce foetoplacental growth retardation via a combination of immunological and cytotoxic mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is {{a benign}} mesenchymal {{tumour of the kidney}} with a {{tendency}} of aneurysm formation {{at risk of}} rupturing. Due to increased maternal circulation and hormonal influences, rupture risk is greater in pregnancy, often leading to a vascular emergency and premature delivery or termination. Presentation of case: A 24 -weeks pregnant woman (45 years old, G 6 P 1) presented with haematuria and flank pain. CT showed AML with acute haemorrhage. The patient became haemodynamically unstable and underwent urgent embolisation and follow-on total radical nephrectomy with the foetus being left in-utero. This involved a multidisciplinary team (urologist, vascular surgeon, interventional radiologist and obstetrician). The procedure was uncomplicated and the pregnancy went to term with a healthy girl delivered at 38 weeks. Discussion: The incidence of AML is 0. 13 % in the general population. 21 reports of haemorrhaging AML in pregnancy have been published in the last 35 years. Mean gestational age was 29. 6 weeks. Eight were treated conservatively to term, one underwent exploratory laparotomy with evacuation of haematoma only, five were embolised, and seven were managed with nephrectomy. Of the nephrectomy subgroup, one was preceded by vaginal delivery and five underwent concurrent caesarean section (one with pre-op embolisation). There were two associated <b>foetal</b> <b>deaths.</b> Conclusion: This case demonstrates that with a multidisciplinary approach, it is possible to successfully leave a foetus undelivered whilst performing a radical nephrectomy for a large bleeding AML in a woman carrying a late second trimester pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|This work {{studies the}} {{influence}} of Neospora caninum intra-species diversity on abortion outcome, infection dynamics in terms of parasite dissemination and peripheral-local immune responses in pregnant cattle. Animals were intravenously inoculated at day 70 of pregnancy with 107 tachyzoites of two isolates showing marked differences in virulence in vitro and in pregnant mouse models: Nc-Spain 7, a high virulence isolate, and Nc-Spain 8, a low-to-moderate virulence isolate. After inoculation, pregnancy was monitored, and dams were culled when <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> was detected. Foetal mortality occurred in all infected heifers between days 24 and 49 post-infection (pi), however, it was detected sooner in Nc-Spain 7 -infected animals (median day[*]=[*] 34) than those inoculated with Nc-Spain 8 (median day[*]=[*] 41) with a trend towards significance (P[*]<[*] 0. 11). Similar histological lesions were observed in placentomes and {{in most of the}} foetuses from the two infected groups. However, parasites were more frequently detected in the placenta and foetuses by PCR and in the foetal brain by immunohistochemistry in Nc-Spain 7 -infected animals. Specific antibodies were detected starting at day 13 post-infection in all infected cattle, with higher IgG levels in Nc-Spain 7 -infected group. IFN-γ and IL- 4 profiles also varied between infected groups in PBMC stimulation assays. Infected animals showed significant increases in their cytokine mRNA levels (IFN-γ, IL- 4, IL- 10, IL- 12 p 40 and TNF-α) in the caruncle at time of <b>foetal</b> <b>death.</b> Differences between the infected groups were also observed for cytokine profiles. These results demonstrate {{the influence of}} the N. caninum isolate on <b>foetal</b> <b>death</b> outcome, infection dynamics and immune responses in cattle. J.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{present study}} {{describes}} the clinical features and plasma profiles of bovine pregnancy-associated glycoprotein 1 (bPAG 1), the main metabolite of prostaglandin F 2 α (PG metabolite) and progesterone (P 4) in heifers in which early abortions were induced. Methods Early abortions were induced in four heifers with cloprostenol and monitored by ultrasonography. Blood {{samples were collected}} and the plasma were analyzed for bPAG 1, P 4 and PG metabolite. Results The foetal heartbeat rates varied from 170 – 186 beats per minute for all foetuses up to the date of cloprostenol treatment. <b>Foetal</b> <b>death</b> was confirmed within two days after cloprostenol treatment. Prior to cloprostenol injection, blood plasma concentrations of bPAG 1, PG metabolite and P 4 varied from 8. 4 – 40. 0 ng/mL, 158 – 275 pmol/L and 20. 7 – 46. 9 nmol/L, respectively. After the foetus expelled, the plasma level of bPAG 1 began to decrease but the decrease was small and gradual. The estimated half-life of bPAG 1 was 1. 8 – 6. 6 days. The plasma level of the PG metabolite started to have short lasting peaks (above 300 pmol/L) within three hours after cloprostenol treatment. The plasma concentrations of P 4 dropped sharply to less than 4 nmol/L after 24 hours of cloprostenol injection. Conclusion The current findings indicated that after early closprostenol-induced <b>foetal</b> <b>death,</b> the plasma concentration of bPAG 1 decreased gradually and showed a tendency of variation with the stages of pregnancy. </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the incidence of facial clefting in Cambridge, UK, using multiple resources of ascertainment and to relate the findings to antenatal ultrasound screening (AUS) detection rates. AUS records from an obstetric ultrasound department, post-natal records from the regional craniofacial unit, and autopsy reports of foetuses over 16 weeks' gestational age from a regional pathology department from 1993 to 1997 were retrospectively reviewed. Cross-referencing between the three data sets identified all cases of facial clefts. Of 23, 577 live and stillbirths, 30 had facial clefts. AUS detected 17 of these. Sixteen of the 30 had isolated facial clefts. Others had associated anomalies, chromosomal defects, or syndromes. Percentages and confidence intervals were calculated from the above data. Twenty-one resulted in live births, seven terminations, and two <b>foetal</b> <b>deaths.</b> Overall, detection rate by AUS was 65 percent [67 percent isolated cleft lip, 93 per cent cleft lip and palate (CLP), and 22 percent isolated cleft palate], with no false positives. The incidence of facial clefts was 0. 127 percent (95 percent confidence interval 0. 089 - 0. 182 percent); the incidence for isolated CLP was lower than previously reported: 0. 067 percent (0. 042 - 0. 110 percent). With one exception, all terminations were in foetuses with multiple anomalies. The figures presented will enable joint CLP clinics to give parents information of termination rates. The study allows pre-pregnancy counselling of families previously affected by clefting about the reliability of AUS detection rates...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Inter-hospital {{emergency}} obstetric transfers {{should be}} carried out effectively and efficiently to avoid any complications to either mother or pregnancy. To date, no relevant data are available in Brunei Darussalam. This study prospectively assesses {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the inter-hospital transfer process to the Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha (RIPAS) Hospital. Materials and Methods: Obstetric patients (n = 92) who were transferred from other hospitals to RIPAS Hospital over a six month period (1 st September 2009 to 28 th February 2010) were studied. Results: The prevalence of emergency obstetric transfers was 3. 65 % of total obstetric admissions to the labour ward and this consisted of 60 antenatal, 30 intrapartum, and two postpartum cases. The most common reason for transfer was gestational hypertension followed by labour pain. Multiple reasons led to 25 % of referrals. Sixteen patients (17 %) arrived without any accompanying medical personnel and 10 patients (11 %) used their own transport. Duration from referral to arrival ranged from 25 minutes to 72 hours. Twenty-one patients (23 %) and 18 (19 %) arrived without any investigation or medications and without referral letters respectively. The mean hospital stay was 3. 4 days. Two cases with singleton pregnancy were referred for intrauterine <b>foetal</b> <b>deaths.</b> Another 59 were born alive. There were no early neonatal deaths. Conclusions: Our study revealed deficiencies in the transfer procedures that can be improved. Fortunately, there were no adverse outcomes during the study period. Further improvements need to be implemented to ensure effective and efficient transfers of emergency cases...|$|R
40|$|In {{developmental}} toxicity studies with exposure before implantation, the toxin {{that is used}} may interfere with the early reproductive process and prevent the implantation of some foetuses that {{would otherwise have been}} formed. A manifestation of this effect is a decreasing trend in the number of implants per dam as the dose level increases. Because unformed foetuses are not observable, Dunson proposed a multiple-imputation approach to estimate the number of missing foetuses. We propose instead to build a model for observable quantities only, namely the observed litter sizes and the observed numbers of deaths or malformations within litters. Using the probabilistic concept of thinning, we express the probability that a foetus fails to implant in terms of the parameters of the litter size distribution. Estimation is by means of generalized estimating equations and takes into account underdispersion of the observed litter sizes and overdispersion of the numbers of <b>foetal</b> <b>deaths</b> or malformations. A combined risk measure that takes into account not just post-implantation death or malformation but also the possibility of failure to implant is proposed and used to determine the virtually safe dose VSD. It is demonstrated numerically and graphically that ignoring the possibility of unformed foetuses leads to estimates of VSD that are too liberal. The proposed generalized estimating equation approach to estimating VSD and finding lower confidence limits is found to work well in a simulation study. We apply the proposed method to two data sets and compare the results that are obtained with those of existing studies. Copyright 2003 Royal Statistical Society. ...|$|R
