5|$|Gandhi's arrest lasted two years, as he {{was held}} in the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. During this period, his long time {{secretary}} Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack, his wife Kasturba died after 18 months' imprisonment on 22 February 1944; and Gandhi suffered a severe malaria attack. While in Jail, he agreed to an interview with Stuart <b>Gelder,</b> a British journalist. <b>Gelder</b> then composed and released an interview summary, cabled it to the mainstream press, that announced sudden concessions Gandhi was willing to make, comments that shocked his countrymen, the Congress workers and even Gandhi. The latter two claimed that it distorted what Gandhi actually said on a range of topics and falsely repudiated the Quit India movement.|$|E

25|$|Geldner studied Sanskrit and Avestan at the University of Leipzig in 1871 {{before moving}} to the University of Tübingen in 1872. He {{received}} a doctorate in Indological studies in 1875, and became a privatdozent following his habilitation in 1876. In 1887, <b>Gelder</b> moved back to the north-east, this time to Halle, where he was appointed extraordinary professor in 1890, followed by an extraordinary faculty-chairmanship at the University of Berlin a few months later.|$|E
25|$|After the UEFA Cup victory, {{the team}} {{chemistry}} started to suffer, which {{was reflected in}} the results. Not long after a 6–0 UEFA Cup loss against Saint-Étienne, Rijvers was sacked and the squad disintegrated. Van Beveren, unhappy with the declining success and Rijvers' departure, left for the United States after 291 league games and years of captaincy. Van <b>Gelder</b> also quit in 1980 and was replaced by Kees Ploegsma. Even though PSV invested in players like Hallvar Thoresen and Jurrie Koolhof, success remained absent. Thijs Libregts' (coach from 1980 until 1983) highest league position was the second place and in 1983, Jan Reker took over. A clash between Van der Kuijlen and Libregts led to the former’s departure in 1982 after nearly 18 seasons at the club.|$|E

25|$|In June 1766, Timothy {{issued a}} warrant for a meeting to elect officers, to form the town of Becket. By 1767, the English {{residents}} of Stockbridge were again working to create a separate township for themselves, behind Timothy's back. The following year, Timothy and his brother Joseph again tried to seek William Johnson's help in New York regarding land claims. The Stockbridges had to sell an additional 150 acres to pay their legal fees, and were again unsuccessful. Also in 1768, Timothy testified about the character {{of one of his}} former students, a man named Joseph Van <b>Gelder,</b> who was half European and half Native American. In 1769, Timothy was selected to a committee for collecting taxes from members of the Susquehanna Company, and was again elected to the General Court, serving from 1769-1771.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>Gelder</b> {{published}} several Avesta-related articles {{while working}} on the revision, following the publication of volume 3 he returned to work almost exclusively on Sanskrit texts. Only two publications after 1895 deal with Avestan topics. Together with Richard Pischel he began {{to work on the}} Vedas, and their collaboration was subsequently published in the three volume Vedische Studien (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1889–1901), which - unlike previous translations - avoided a purely linguistic methodology and instead took indigenous tradition into account. Following his return to Marburg in 1907, Geldner dedicated his efforts to a translation of the RigVeda, which was sent to his publisher in 1928 but did not reach the public until after the author's death in February 1929. The three volumes of his monumental Der Rig-Veda aus dem Sanskrit ins Deutsche übersetzt were finally released in 1951.|$|E
25|$|Connie Fisher was {{selected}} by public voting as {{the winner of the}} show. In early 2007, Fisher suffered from a heavy cold that prevented her from performing for two weeks. To prevent further disruptions, an alternate Maria, Aoife Mulholland, a fellow contestant on How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?, played Maria on Monday evenings and Wednesday matinee performances. Simon Shepherd was originally cast as Captain von Trapp, but after two preview performances he was withdrawn from the production, and Alexander Hanson moved into the role in time for the official opening date along with Lesley Garrett as the Mother Abbess. After Garrett left, Margaret Preece took the role. The cast also featured Lauren Ward as the Baroness, Ian <b>Gelder</b> as Max, Sophie Bould as Liesl, and Neil McDermott as Rolf. Other notable replacements have included Simon Burke and Simon MacCorkindale as the Captain and newcomer Amy Lennox as Liesl. Summer Strallen replaced Fisher in February 2008, with Mulholland and later Gemma Baird portraying Maria on Monday evenings and Wednesday matinees.|$|E

25|$|In 1955, PSV {{became the}} first Dutch club to enter the European Champion Clubs' Cup. The two matches against Rapid Wien ended in 1–6 and 1–0. Other success in the 1950s {{remained}} absent but in the 1956–57 season, Dillen scored 43 times, a Dutch record that still stands today. The approaching 1960s marked a shift in player’s heritage: the team went from mostly Brabantian men to players nationwide. Representative for this policy were defender Roel Wiersma, who arrived in 1954 and captained the team for a decade, and Piet van der Kuil, who came from Ajax for the equivalent of €59,000 (PSV's then-highest transfer fee). Dillen left the club in 1961 after being club top scorer every year from 1953 to 1960. In 1962, Otten also decided to quit {{as chairman of the}} sports union. By then, board member Ben van <b>Gelder</b> had gradually started to mold the club in his way. Throughout the next two decades, he became responsible for turning PSV into a full-fledged professional organization.|$|E
25|$|At the {{annexation}} of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, {{and because of}} his British citizenship (he had apparently hung the Union Jack from his house in Vienna), Seilern decided in 1939 to return to England, bringing with him his already large art collection and his library. Based in England now {{he was able to}} provide finance to support to another art historian fleeing from Nazi-occupied Austria, Ludwig Münz, as well as helping Johannes Wilde and his Jewish wife to leave Vienna. The Director of the National Gallery, Sir Kenneth Clark, sponsored Wilde who was reunited with Seilern at Aberystwyth in Wales where his collection was important enough to be hidden with works of art from the National Gallery and Royal Collection. Seilern then enlisted in the ranks of the British army (though aged thirty-eight), serving in the Royal Artillery, and in 1940 immediately volunteered for the disastrous Russo-Finnish campaign, only escaping from occupied Norway. It {{was at the end of}} the Second World War, whilst acting as a German interpreter in the Intelligence Corps, that he appeared at the door of Professor Jan van <b>Gelder</b> in Amsterdam to pick up three oil sketches by Rubens he had bought for Seilern from the Koenig collection in 1940 and had deposited as 'Swedish property' at an Amsterdam bank.|$|E
