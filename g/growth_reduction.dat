40|$|Abstract: Basal area growth trends were {{determined}} for ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, to: (1) evaluate long term growth patterns, and (2) {{determine if there}} has been any recent change in the frequency of growth changes outside the expected range of natural variability. Ponderosa pine was sampled in 56 stands with the sample divided equally between sites with and without documentation of symptomatic ozone injury. Basal area increment growth was calculated, temporal growth patterns were evaluated for each tree using time series analysis techniques, and changes in growth trends were summarized for each site by decade. There were several regional growth trends during this century, including a large number of growth decreases in the 1920 s and a large number of increases in the 1930 s. Many trends were synchronous within stands but were less frequently synchronous between stands. There were significant <b>growth</b> <b>reductions</b> since 1950 in some stands in the southern Sierra. These <b>growth</b> <b>reductions</b> occurred in areas with the highest levels of ozone exposure and needle injury. There was no evidence, however, of significant numbers of recent <b>growth</b> <b>reductions</b> for the entire Sierra Nevada region.

50|$|Another {{major threat}} to the {{expansion}} of wheat is aluminum toxicity in soil, which represents 40% of the world's arable land. Though the exact mechanism of aluminum toxicity is unclear, scientists know that it inhibits root cell growth by blocking Ca2+ channels, ultimately disrupting transport and communication within the plant. Soil limiting is a practice used to deter Al toxicity by raising the pH of the soil. However, this can be costly and difficult to implement on a large scale. Thus, investigating the use of more tolerant plants is a noteworthy effort. L. racemosus genes helped prevent root <b>growth</b> <b>reduction</b> when incorporated into modern wheat cultivars.

Coniferous trees also tend to ooze resin from infected areas whereas broad-leaved trees sometimes develop sunken cankers.

50|$|The spruce bud moths of {{the genus}} Zeiraphera, transcontinental in range, are found {{frequently}} on white spruce but only occasionally on other spruces and firs (Rose and Lindquist 1985). Zeiraphera canadensis (Mutuura and Freeman Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), has caused {{a high incidence of}} multiple and abnormal leaders in white spruce in the Maritime provinces, Quebec, and Maine (Quiring et al. 1991). However, although severe feeding damage has seldom been extensive in forests, new shoots on open-grown white spruce are frequently disfigured (Rose and Lindquist 1985). The insect overwinters in the egg stage on the tree. The larva emerges in May and feeds underneath the bud cap, which it characteristically secures to the growing shoot with silk. The cap remains in place long after the other bud caps have been shed, an obvious impediment to the effectiveness of contact insecticides. When populations are high, it is not unusual to find several larvae feeding among the needles of a single shoot. The head and thoracic legs of young larvae are dark brown, but full-grown larvae are cream to yellow and about 10 mm long. Feeding is completed in June or early July, whereupon the larva drops to the ground and becomes a pupa in the litter. From mid-July to mid-August, moths emerge from the pupae to lay eggs singly or in groups of two to seven at the base of shoots of the current year. In a New Brunswick seed orchard, white spruce of intermediate height (1.5 to 3.73 m) were damaged most, and damage in one year was positively correlated with damage in the next. At four test sites, mean <b>growth</b> <b>reduction</b> of trees in the two most susceptible families was estimated to be approximately 30% higher than those of trees in the two least susceptible families. The lack of damage to some trees, among those trees suffering damage, suggested the existence of genetically based differences in susceptibility to this pest.|$|E

40|$|Many studies {{demonstrate}} resource-based trade-offs between {{growth and}} defence {{on a large}} timescale. Yet, the short-term dynamics of this growth reaction are still completely unclear, {{making it difficult to}} explain growth-defence trade-offs mechanistically. In this study, image-based non-destructive methods were used to quantify root growth reactions happening within hours following simulated herbivore attack. The induction of wound reactions in Nicotiana attenuata in the seedling stage led to transiently decreased root growth rates. Application of the oral secretion of the specialist herbivore Manduca sexta to the leaves led to a transient decrease in root growth that was more pronounced than if a mere mechanical wounding was imposed. Root <b>growth</b> <b>reduction</b> was more pronounced than leaf <b>growth</b> <b>reduction.</b> When fatty acid-amino acid conjugates (FACs) were applied to wounds, root <b>growth</b> <b>reduction</b> occurred in the same intensity as when oral secretion was applied. Timing of the transient <b>growth</b> <b>reduction</b> coincided with endogenous bursts of jasmonate (JA) and ethylene emissions reported in literature. Simulation of a wound response by applying methyl jasmonate (MeJA) led to more prolonged negative effects on root growth. Increased nicotine concentrations, trichome lengths and densities were observed within 72 h in seedlings that were treated with MeJA or that were mechanically wounded. Overall, these reactions indicate that even in a very early developmental stage, the diversion of plant metabolism from primary (growth-sustaining) to secondary (defence-related) metabolism can cause profound alterations of plant growth performance...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The {{growth of}} western hemlock {{during the first}} four years of {{seedling}} establishment was examined in a competitive environment in which seedlings were exposed to various types of animal damage and salmonberry and/or alder competition. The study utilized an existing Nelder/replacement series experiment which focused on the competitive effects among western hemlock, red alder, and salmonberry. Vegetative competition was evaluated in terms of overtopping and encroaching cover within a one meter radius of each seedling. Animal damage observed in the study included browsing, (feeding injury of deer and elk), racking (antler rubbing from deer and elk), clipping and girdling (feeding injury from rabbits and hares.) Hemlock growth in terms of total height, height growth, and total volume, was compared between damaged and undamaged seedlings through multiple regression analysis. Sites used in this study were located in the central Coast Range of Oregon on three separate clearcut units. <b>Growth</b> <b>reductions</b> for hemlock seedlings were mainly due to vegetative competition. The best predictors of hemlock growth were overtopping by salmonberry and overtopping by alder.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine if {{temperature}} conditions potentially causing frost damage have an effect on radial growth in Norway spruce and Scots pine in Finland. We hypothesized that frost damage occurs and reduces radial growth after (1) extreme cold winter temperatures, (2) frost hardiness levels insufficient to minimum temperatures, and (3) the lack of insulating snow cover during freezing temperatures, resulting in increased frost and decreased temperatures in soil. Meteorological records were used to define variables describing the conditions of each hypothesis and a dynamic frost hardiness model was used to find events of insufficient frost hardiness levels. As frost damage is likely to occur only under exceptional conditions, we used generalized extreme value distributions to describe the frost variables. Our results did not show strong connections between radial growth and the frost damage events. However, significant <b>growth</b> <b>reductions</b> were found at some Norway spruce sites after events insufficient frost hardiness levels, and alternatively, after winters with high frost sum of snowless days. Scots pine did not show significant <b>growth</b> <b>reductions</b> associated with any of the studied variables.
