40|$|The 2008 {{financial}} crisis made clear the shortcomings in the European structure of <b>financial</b> <b>supervision.</b> In the cur­rent system of <b>financial</b> <b>supervision</b> the <b>financial</b> supervi­sor {{of the home}} Member State is in principle the only autho­rity entitled to supervise financial institutions even in case the institution operates across borders. If the home financial supervisor does not effectively supervise the financial insti­tution, this failure could affect clients and creditors in other Member States. The bankruptcy of Icelandic banks was felt by accountholders in the United Kingdom and the Nether­lands. The shortcomings in the Icelandic Deposit Guaran­tee scheme 1 threatened to expose these depositors to losses on their savings {{that should have been}} covered by that sche­me. In the end, the UK and the Dutch government guaran­teed these deposits under the applicable deposit-guarantee scheme. However, the problems arising in the execution of the agreement concluded between the UK, Dutch and Icel­andic government to recover the UK and Dutch taxpayers’ money from Iceland show the enormous consequences of failure in local supervision. Despite their significant relevan­ce in the current crisis, in this article I will not address these problems in micro-prudential supervision of banks. This ar­ticle focuses on the mechanism to ensure consistent applica­tion by the different national supervisors of the harmonised set of conduct of business rules, in particular, the rules laid down in the Prospectus Directive 20032 and the Transparen­cy Directive 2004. 3 In order to solve the shortcomings in the European struc­ture of <b>financial</b> <b>supervision,</b> the European <b>Commission</b> pro­posed to create a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS) consisting of national supervisors and three new su­pranational European Supervisory Authorities. A Superviso­ry Authority for the banking sector 4, one for the insurance and pensions sector 5 and a supranational European Supervi­sory Authority to ensure compliance by financial institutions with conduct of business rules and the orderly functioning of the securities market. 6 The national financial supervisors remain the principal supervisory authorities. However, the supranational authorities will get decisive authority in case of emergency or continued non-agreement between national supervisors. In these cases the supranational authorities will have the authority to address directly financial institutions that do not comply with the European financial services and <b>financial</b> <b>supervision</b> legislation. In this article I will analyse in paragraph 2 the current struc­ture of <b>financial</b> <b>supervision.</b> In paragraph 3 I will discuss the de Larosière-report on the {{financial crisis}} and the present shortcomings in European <b>financial</b> <b>supervision</b> will be dealt with. Paragraph 4 provides a brief overview of the reaction of the European Commission to this report. In paragraph 5 I will describe the proposals of the European Commission. Paragraph 6 discusses the proposed future powers of the Eu­ropean Securities and Markets Authority to ensure compli­ance with the European rules on the prospectus and financi­al reporting. In paragraph 7 the proposed amendments of the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Moneta­ry Affairs will be discussed. In paragraph 8 some concluding remarks are provided...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{institutional}} arrangement of <b>financial</b> <b>supervision</b> in the Czech Republic. Financial markets {{are composed of}} partial financial segments specialized in individual types of financial instruments and individual customer groups.

There are several models of institutional arrangement of <b>financial</b> <b>supervision</b> (integrated <b>financial</b> <b>supervision</b> model, sectional <b>financial</b> <b>supervision</b> model, <b>financial</b> <b>supervision</b> {{within the framework of}} the central bank, functional model of <b>financial</b> <b>supervision).</b> Creation of <b>financial</b> supermarkets encourages integration of supervisory institutions, generally outside the central bank. In the Czech Republic, several versions of institutional structure of <b>financial</b> market <b>supervision</b> have been discussed in the new millennium. Final decision was implemented precipitately without deeper analysis. The supervision of the all financial market was entrusted to the Czech National Bank with close liaison between execution of monetary policy and supervisory activities. Institutional structure does not automatically guarantee efficient supervision. Efficient supervision is based on an independent and transparent institution, staffed with quality employees and enforcement competences, supporting financial market development...|$|R

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{economic}} crisis of 1997 - 98 South Korea undertook a number of reforms in <b>financial</b> <b>supervision.</b> In spite of these reforms doubts have been raised as to whether Korea has in fact succeeded in creating a system of <b>financial</b> <b>supervision</b> capable of dealing with certain risks and responding to new challenges appropriately.

40|$|The {{necessity}} of rebuilding Chinese rural <b>financial</b> <b>supervision</b> system is expounded. Rebuilding rural <b>financial</b> <b>supervision</b> system {{is conducive to}} normalizing rural financial order and forming the benign competitive situation; to clarifying {{the role played by}} rural financial organization and providing better financial services for â€œthree agricultureâ€; to forming safe rural financial environment to promote the development of rural economy and national economy. The restricting factors of rebuilding Chinese rural <b>financial</b> <b>supervision</b> system are analyzed. The major reasons are that rural financial legislation is relatively backward and the supervision department lacks the necessary legal basis. The administrative supervision is insufficient, which lead to the mal-position, administrative offside and vacancy of rural financial supervision; rural financial organization mechanism is unreasonable and the internal supervision mechanism is relatively bad; supervision organization of rural financial industry is imperfect and the function is imperfect; public's supervision awareness is weak and social supervision mechanism develops slowly. The paths for rebuilding Chinese rural <b>financial</b> <b>supervision</b> system are put forward including accelerating rural financial legislation to provide perfect legal evidence for rural <b>financial</b> <b>supervision</b> system; clarifying the position on governmental functions and fully displaying the leading role of rural financial supervision; establishing specialized rural <b>financial</b> <b>supervision</b> organization to perfect its supervision functions; vigorously cultivating people's supervision awareness to promote the development of social <b>supervision</b> mechanism.
