50|$|In 2000, a {{woman with}} no {{underlying}} cardiac abnormalities developed S. equinus endocarditis. However, the patient also had pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X.</b> While {{this may have been}} a coincidence, such patients have many abnormalities of the immune system including imbalance of the immunoregulatory cell system and a decreased production of natural antibodies. Such abnormalities can predispose the patients with <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> to the development of bacterial infections, and a similar mechanism may have taken place in this patient.|$|E
50|$|The {{disease has}} gone by several names, {{including}} Hand-Sch√ºller-Christian disease, Abt-Letterer-Siwe disease, Hashimoto-Pritzker disease(a very rare self limiting variant seen at birth) and <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X,</b> {{until it was}} renamed in 1985 by the Histiocyte Society.|$|E

50|$|Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a well-tolerated {{diagnostic}} procedure in ILD. BAL cytology analyses (differential cell counts) {{should be considered}} in the evaluation of patients with IPF at the discretion of the treating physician based on availability and experience at their institution. BAL may reveal alternative specific diagnoses: malignancy, infections, eosinophilic pneumonia, <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X,</b> or alveolar proteinosis. In the evaluation of patients with suspected IPF, the most important application of BAL is in the exclusion of other diagnoses. Prominent lymphocytosis (>30%) generally allows excluding a diagnosis of IPF.|$|E
40|$|Proliferating {{cells in}} <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> (<b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells) share many {{structural}} and immunophenotypic features with Langerhans cells, {{leading to the}} assumption that histiocytosis represents a proliferative disorder or Langerhans cells. Because, depending on their state of activation and/or differentiation, Langerhans cells exhibit a varying immunophenotype, we investigated whether <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells display a similar phenotypic heterogeneity and, if so, whether the heterogenous biological behavior of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> is reflected by differences in the immunophenotype of the proliferating Cells. In 21 patients suffering from different clinical manifestations of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X,</b> proliferating cells uniformly expressed class I and II alloantigens, T 200, CD 1, CD 4, and S 100 protein. In 12 of 21 cases, <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells additionally exhibited immunocytochemically detectable amounts of C 3 b and C 3 bi receptors and certain monocyte/macrophage antigens (CDw 14, Ki-Mi, Ki-M 6). This immunophenotypic heterogeneity of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells could not be correlated with clinical course, prognosis, and final outcome of the disease in a given patient. The capacity of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells to immunophenotypically mimic various states of Langerhans cell activation and/or differentiation, however, underscores the concept of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> as a proliferative disorder of Langerhans cell origin...|$|E

RESULTS: Immunohistochemical and light microscopy studies were performed to obtain the correct diagnosis. Diffuse thyroid involvement by <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> was demonstrated. CONCLUSION: Thyroid scintigraphy was helpful in successfully diagnosing thyroid involvement by <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X.</b> Because tracer uptake is related to increased cellularity and metabolism, none of these tracers reported here is specific for defining <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X...</b>|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the secretory function of cell suspensions from bone eosinophilic granulomas surgically collected in two patients with <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X.</b> Unseparated cell preparations spontaneously produced interleukin 1 (IL- 1) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2). In order to ascertain that this secretion {{was due to the}} characteristic Langerhans cell-like <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells predominantly found in the bone lesions, we have purified T 6 + cells by the use of a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Such highly purified cell preparations were found to secrete IL- 1 and PGE 2 spontaneously in culture. Stimulation with endotoxins and treatment with interferon gamma (IFN gamma) revealed an intense IL- 1 secretory function of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells. Since both IL- 1 and PGE 2 are able to induce bone resorption in vitro, our findings are compatible with the hypothesis that <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells are responsible for the typical osteolytic lesion observed in <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> through the local secretion of these two mediators...|$|E
40|$|Two young {{patients}} {{presented with}} generalised lymphadenopathy, otorrhoea, otitis, and rash. Over {{the next few}} years chronically discharging sinuses began to form over enlarged nodes and histological appearances were typical of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X.</b> In neither case were micro-organisms isolated from the lesions, and in both patients healing occurred with immunosuppressive agents. Chronic dermal sinus formation secondary to lymph node disease has never before been recorded as a manifestation of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X.</b> <b>Histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of "suppurative" lymphadenopathy so that appropriate treatment may be given without delay...|$|E
40|$|Three {{patients}} with biopsy proven <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> who developed a clinical and pathological picture compatible with sclerosing cholangitis are reported. In one patient, operative biopsy {{of the common}} bile duct revealed <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> in the granulomatous/xanthomatous phase. At necropsy, however, only fibrosis of the biliary tree was seen, a picture consistent with sclerosing cholangitis. Fibrotic obstruction of the biliary tree led to death from liver failure in all three patients. The aetiology of primary sclerosing cholangitis is unknown and may be multifactorial. Perhaps involvement of the biliary tree by <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> is one cause...|$|E
40|$|There {{exists a}} rarely {{observed}} association between pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> and bronchopulmonary cancer. However, {{the frequency of}} bronchopulmonary cancer in these patients is {{higher than in the}} general population. A 28 -year-old patient who currently smokes ten packs of cigarettes a year came to our department of pneumology with complains of cough and hemoptysis. An x-ray of the thorax revealed bilateral cysts and a shadow in {{the upper part of the}} right pulmonary field. In addition, a chest tomography showed multiple cysts dispersed throughout the two pulmonary fields and an irregular mass with a diameter of four centimetres in the upper right lobe. Bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma was diagnosed during a cytologic exam of the bronchial washing. We decided to perform a thoracotomy on the patient, since there was no far metastasis. An upper lobectomy and wedge resection of the upper segment of the lower right lobe, which had been invaded by the tumour, were performed. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. A pulmonary biopsy was carried out on the tumour-free site and showed the presence of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X.</b> There is a hypothesis that a neoplasm developed on the pulmonary fibrosis could be an epiphenomenon of bronchopulmonary cancer in patients who smoke and have pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X.</b> It is interesting to note that <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> and bronchopulmonary cancer were diagnosed at the same time, since the bronchopulmonary cancer may have occurred within a few years following the diagnosis of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X,</b> even if she was a smoker. Hemoptysis, which is found in 5 % of patients with <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X,</b> may suggest cancer. This young patient, a smoker, who complained of hemoptysis, is a particularly rare case of the association between pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> and bronchopulmonary cancer whose pathogenesis is not clear cut. It is thus important to note that smoking can have major consequences, even in young people...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> is a {{disorder}} characterised {{by the presence}} of destructive granulomas preferentially involving distal bronchioles, that contain numerous activated Langerhans' cells. Recent studies have shown that granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is produced by normal bronchiolar epithelium, may play an important part in the distribution and differentiation of Langerhans' cells. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the role of this factor in the pathogenesis of pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X.</b> METHODS: Four patients with pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> were examined by immunohistochemical techniques for GM-CSF and CD 1 a surface molecules. RESULTS: In early lesions the epithelium of bronchioles affected by the disease was strongly positive for GM-CSF and infiltrated by numerous CD 1 a+ Langerhans' cells organised into granulomas. In contrast, the expression of GM-CSF was substantially lower in bronchioles not affected by the disease, and these bronchioles contained few Langerhans' cells. When destruction by <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> lesions was more advanced, only remnants of bronchiolar epithelium could occasionally be identified; these remained strongly reactive for GM-CSF. Langerhans' cells within granulomas also moderately expressed this cytokine. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that GM-CSF could be one of the factors responsible for the local accumulation of lymphostimulatory Langerhans' cells in early lesions of pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} resonance imaging features of two cases of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> in the hypothalamus {{and one in the}} cerebral hemispheres are described. The lesions were best seen with spin-echo technique using a long repetition time (TR = 1580 msec) and long echo time (TE = 80 msec). Sagittal images provided the best anatomicotopographic evaluation of the lesions. Comparison with computed tomography with and without contrast enhancement showed an advantage with {{magnetic resonance}} imaging. Disseminated <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> is a reticuloendothelial disorder of unknown etiology that often involves the central nervous system. Direct radiologic demonstration of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> lesions in the central nervous system was made possible by the introduction of computed tomography (CT) [1, 2]. We demonstrate the use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> lesions in the common hypothalamic location as well as the less common hemispheric site. The MR findings were compared with those of CT. Materials and Methods Three patients with histologically confirmed evidence of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> were examined with MR imaging. MR imaging was performed with a Picker prototype superconducting magnet operating at 0. 15 T (6. 5 MHz). Inversion-recovery and spin-echo (SE) pulse sequences were used as described previously [3].

40|$|Based on {{the finding}} that Langerhans cells and <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells react with the {{monoclonal}} antibody OKT 6, raised against a subset of thymocytes, we used this antibody to study the cells collected by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from 131 patients, including 18 with pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X,</b> 43 with pulmonary sarcoidosis, 67 with miscellaneous pulmonary disorders, and 3 controls. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated the presence of OKT 6 -reactive cells in all patients with pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> (mean +/- SEM, 5. 29 % +/- 1. 14 % of all cells in BAL fluid). Immunoelectron microscopic studies revealed that the cells labeled in these patients (n = 13) contained Langerhans granules. The number of fluorescent cells in the other 113 patients was significantly smaller (mean +/- SEM, 0. 20 % +/- 0. 04 % of all cells; P less than 0. 001). In the 3 control patients, in the 43 patients with sarcoidosis, and in 61 of the 67 patients with miscellaneous disorders unrelated to <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X,</b> no cells or less than 1 % of the total were labeled; however, in the 6 remaining patients in this miscellaneous group, 1. 3 to 2. 8 % of all cells in BAL were labeled. In 3 of these 6 patients, immunoelectronmicroscopic examination showed that the cells labeled by OKT 6 had the general characteristics of Langerhans cells but lacked Langerhans granules.

40|$|Pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> is {{the local}} manifestation of a {{systemic}} disorder of unknown cause characterised by infiltration of Langerhans cell like histiocytes and parenchymal fibrosis. In a male smoker with histologically proved <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> and functional impairment bronchoalveolar lavage showed an increase in CD- 1 /OKT- 6 antigen positive histiocytes to 8 %. Northern blot analysis of RNA from bronchoalveolar lavage cells showed an exaggerated expression of the M-CSF gene and of the c-fms gene encoding for the corresponding receptor. An increased level of c-sis RNA, which encodes the B chain of platelet derived growth factor, was also found. Diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates on the chest radiograph resolved with glucocorticoid treatment and CD- 1 /OKT- 6 antigen positive histiocytes fell to 3 %. Macrophage colony stimulating factor, c-fms and c-sis gene expression were reduced almost to normal after treatment.
