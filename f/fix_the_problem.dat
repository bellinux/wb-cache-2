The doctors discovered that he had ruptured an important blood vessel and immediate surgery was needed to fix it. The operation failed to <b>fix</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> and he died early in the morning on 10 February 1962. His son, Michael, succeeded him as Baron Birkett.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{rendezvous}} of the Kvant-1 module with Mir on 5 April 1987 {{was troubled}} {{by the failure of}} the onboard control system. After the failure of the second attempt to dock, the resident cosmonauts, Yuri Romanenko and Aleksandr Laveykin, conducted an EVA to <b>fix</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> They found a trash bag which had been left in orbit after the departure of one of the previous cargo ships and was now located between the module and the station, which prevented the docking. After removing the bag, docking was completed on 12 April.|$|E

Sun Ce and Zhou Yu defeated Huang Zu with a naval fire attack at Xiakou and convinced Gan Ning to join them, and Zhou Yu inflicted a decisive defeat on Meng Huo's elephant troops in Nanman. To <b>fix</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> with Cao Cao, Sun Jian allied with Liu Bei and defeated Cao Cao's fleet at Chi Bi.|$|E

5|$|Microsoft {{originally}} {{announced that}} users {{who did not}} install the update would not receive any other updates after May 13, 2014. However, meeting this deadline proved challenging: The ability to deploy Windows 8.1 Update through Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) was disabled shortly after its release following {{the discovery of a}} bug which affects the ability to use WSUS as a whole in certain server configurations. Microsoft later fixed the issue but users continued to report that the update may fail to install. Microsoft's attempt to <b>fix</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> was ineffective, to the point that Microsoft pushed the support deadline further to June 30, 2014. On 16 May, Microsoft released additional updates to fix a problem of BSOD in the update.|$|E
5|$|Chris Candido was an American {{professional}} wrestler who wrestled for TNA {{starting in}} 2005. At TNA's Lockdown PPV event on April24, 2005, Candido teamed with Lance Hoyt to face Apolo and Sonny Siaki in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match. During the encounter, Candido suffered an injury which was later diagnosed as a dislocated ankle, broken tibia, {{and a broken}} fibula which required surgery. Candido had an operation on April25 to have a plate, screws, and pins placed in his ankle to <b>fix</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> with him being sidelined from competing {{for two to three}} months in order to heal. However, Candido hoped to be fully recovered in six to eight weeks. On April28, Candido {{was rushed to the hospital}} after he collapsed, where he died a short time later. The cause of death was released by Candido's brother Johnny as a blood clot due to the surgery a few days prior.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{shortage}} of Brownings, which had been selected as the new standard rifle calibre machine gun for the RAF in 1934, early Spitfires were fitted with only four guns, with the other four fitted later. Early tests showed that while the guns worked perfectly {{on the ground and}} at low altitudes, they tended to freeze at high altitude, especially the outer wing guns. This was because the RAF's Brownings had been modified to fire from an open bolt. While this prevented overheating of the cordite used in British ammunition, it allowed cold air to flow through the barrel unhindered. Supermarine did not <b>fix</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> until October 1938, when they added hot air ducts {{from the rear of the}} wing mounted radiators to the guns, and bulkheads around the gunbays to trap the hot air in the wing. Red fabric patches were doped over the gun ports to protect the guns from cold, dirt and moisture until they were fired. Even if the eight Brownings worked perfectly, pilots soon discovered that they were not sufficient to destroy larger aircraft. Combat reports showed that an average of 4,500 rounds were needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft. In November 1938, tests against armoured and unarmoured targets had already indicated that the introduction of a weapon with a calibre of at least 20mm was urgently needed.|$|E

5|$|Besides Chris Candido {{suffering}} a leg injury during his tag team match, Abyss also suffered a dislocated shoulder during {{the main event}} against A.J. Styles. Abyss' injury was taken care of backstage after the event, but Candido {{was diagnosed with a}} dislocated ankle, broken tibia, and a broken fibula that required surgery. Candido had an operation on April 25 to have a plate, screws, and pins placed in his ankle to <b>fix</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> Candido was reported to be sidelined for 2 to 3 months. According to reports, Candido suffered the injury from taking a dropkick by Sonny Siaki and landing on his leg improperly. After the surgery, he hoped to be recovered in 6 to 8 weeks. On April28, Candido {{was rushed to the hospital}} after he collapsed where he died a short time later. Cause of death was released by his brother Johnny afterwards as a blood clot due to the surgery a few days prior. TNA released a public statement on April29 regarding the subject. TNA paid tribute to Candido on the April29 episode of Impact! as well as at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event. The April29 episode of Impact! opened and ended with a memorial to Candido. At Hard Justice, a ten-bell salute was held while a photo of Candido, a pair of boots, and one-half of the NWA World Tag Team Championship positioned on a steel chair sat in the center of the ring. In TNA's 50 Greatest Moments DVD, Candido's aiding The Naturals to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship was listed as number 10. A portion of the Lockdown DVD sale profits were donated by TNA to the Chris Candido Memorial Fund. TNA originally planned to remove Candido's match from the DVD, but were given the blessing of his family to include it on the publication. A tribute to Candido was included on the DVD by TNA.|$|E

25|$|Surgery was {{a common}} {{practice}} among physicians as treatment for physical injuries. The Egyptian physicians recognized three categories of injuries; treatable, contestable, and untreatable ailments. Treatable ailments the surgeons would quickly set to right. Contestable ailments were those where the victim could presumably survive without treatment, so patients assumed {{to be in this}} category were observed and if they survived then surgical attempts could be made to <b>fix</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> with them. They used knives, hooks, drills, forceps, pincers, scales, spoons, saws and a vase with burning incense.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy {{commissioned}} {{a study of}} Fallingwater’s structural integrity.

An architecture firm was hired to <b>fix</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> Both the concrete and its steel reinforcement were close to their failure limits. As a result, in 1997, temporary girders were installed beneath the cantilevers to carry their weight.|$|E
