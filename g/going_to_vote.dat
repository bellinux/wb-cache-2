The act specified that electors must be bona fide males who were not aliens or unenfranchised Indians. Electors must also have resided in the territory for at least 12 months to the day of the writ being dropped.|$|E
5|$|The role {{of women}} in the Fasci siciliani was substantial, but is {{regularly}} overlooked in historical accounts. Women were often at the forefront of demonstrations and strikes, speaking in public meetings and conferences. During municipal elections they made sure that men were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> (women did {{not have the right to}} vote at the time). They patrolled the taverns to prevent the men from betraying the duty of militancy with bottles of wine. They also took care of many organizational aspects and were particularly active in proselytizing for the movement, decorating the stage of the rallies, preparing ceremonies such as the inauguration opening of the flag of the Fasci, and welcoming the leaders who came to the towns with flowers.|$|E
25|$|TCU's AD at the time, Frank Windegger {{was told}} by colleagues that TCU was {{discussed}} as a package deal with BYU, with the idea even <b>going</b> <b>to</b> a <b>vote</b> --- but the expansion vote was narrowly defeated.|$|R

25|$|On 21 May 2008 heavy gunfire was {{reported}} near the Abkhaz administrative border. A Georgian interior ministry official said two buses of passengers <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in the Georgian elections were fired upon. Some reports said the bridge, connecting Abkhazia and Georgian region of Mingrelia, {{was blocked by}} Abkhaz separatists during the elections in Georgia. Georgian officials accused Abkhazia of the attacks and preventing Georgians from voting in the legislative elections. Abkhaz president Sergei Bagapsh denied these allegations, instead saying that the attack occurred on the Georgian territory and Georgians living in Abkhazia {{were not interested in}} voting. Abkhazia said Russian peacekeepers were sent to the border to prevent further violence.|$|E
500|$|In March 2004, Hudema {{said that}} he was unsure whether he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in the 2004 federal election, saying that he went [...] "back and forth" [...] on the {{question}} of whether it was more useful to perform a [...] "theatrical" [...] stunt to draw attention to problems with the electoral system or to work to get progressive candidates elected.|$|E
500|$|Affleck {{registered}} to vote as a Democrat in 1992, and has campaigned {{on behalf of a}} number of Democratic presidential nominees. He supported Al Gore in the final weeks of the 2000 presidential campaign, attending rallies in California, Pennsylvania, and Florida. However, Affleck was unable to vote due to a registration issue in New York, where he was then residing, and later joked, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> twice next time, in true Boston fashion." ...|$|E
30|$|Another {{mechanism}} {{might be}} the type of content that TV 3 supplied by that time. Could it be proved that news or programs encouraged people <b>going</b> out <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> as well as voting for a specific political party? It is important {{to go into a}} content analysis to study with more detail the mechanism by which TV 3 could influence political outcomes.|$|R

5000|$|David Shipley, {{an analyst}} at the University of New Brunswick's Information Technology Services department, has criticized the party for running mostly on Internet-related issues, which may not be enough <b>to</b> garner <b>votes.</b> He is quoted as saying: [...] "How much people decide where they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> place their <b>vote</b> based on their {{entertainment}} preferences, I'm not sure." ...|$|R
500|$|Affleck {{appeared}} alongside then-Senator Barack Obama at a 2006 rally, introducing him as [...] "the most galvanizing {{leader to}} come out of either party, in my opinion, in at least a decade". He donated to Obama's presidential campaign in 2007, and hosted two fundraisers for the candidate during the 2008 Democratic Primary. Affleck urged voters to [...] "help make history" [...] in a MoveOn.org campaign, and made several appearances during the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In the week of the presidential election, he appeared on Saturday Night Live to jokingly endorse Senator John McCain.

500|$|After O'Leary's {{revelation that}} {{producers}} had rehearsed {{what would happen}} if Cole abstained in week 5, allegations were made that the result was rigged for Waissel to stay, given that her outlandish performances and growing unpopularity with the public resulted in better ratings and sensational press for the show. Cowell denied this claim, saying he would never want to defraud viewers and said the situation had [...] "been blown out of proportion". O'Leary defended himself and the show on Twitter, saying [...] "We never know which way the judges are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote.</b> Ever. The only thing I know is who's in the bottom two when I'm given the card. I don't know which judge to go to until I'm called and the judges, including , don't know the vote or who we're coming to next. It's that simple." [...] The following week, Heat magazine printed a report claiming that Cowell was aware of the public votes before the judges make their votes, and several other media reports contained rumours of the show being fixed. The X Factor bosses instructed their lawyers to file a formal complaint to the Press Complaints Commission against Heat, saying that the article was a lie, that very few people know the actual public voting results and conspiracy theories being printed in the media are [...] "total and utter rubbish". Heat printed an apology in their 1 January 2011 issue and accepted that Cowell was unaware of the votes cast until after the final.|$|E

2500|$|While {{this appears}} an {{effective}} strategy in theory {{there are a}} number of problems with it in practice. Firstly accurate information is needed about how other voters are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> in practice this information is difficult to obtain. Secondly if all voters vote for candidates they believe will lose, these candidates will win. [...] In general, this strategy will not work if everyone uses it. [...] Little evidence exists of the use of this strategy in the real world.|$|E

50|$|Party {{identification}} becomes somewhat formalized when {{a person}} runs for partisan office. In most states, this means declaring oneself {{a candidate for the}} nomination of a particular party and intent to enter that party's primary election for an office. A party committee may choose to endorse one or another of those who is seeking the nomination, but in the end the choice is up to those who choose <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in the primary, and {{it is often difficult to}} tell who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do the <b>voting.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Pete: Although Charlotte was Ular's next target, Pete lost immunity.

Richard told Pete, who was upset (as he had asked to be told when he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>voted</b> off and the others refused to tell him). Pete then told Charlotte. Charlotte voted against Eve according to the Helang strategy. Pete stuck to the original plan and voted against Charlotte, keeping his word even knowing that he had been betrayed. Before leaving, Pete pretended to be taken by surprise, and took his betrayal personally. He threw his bible at Richard. (5-1-1) ...|$|R

50|$|Michael Foot's {{election}} as Labour party leader {{indicated that the}} party was likely to become more left-wing, and in 1980 committed itself to withdrawing from the EEC without even a referendum (as Labour had carried out in 1975).

2500|$|Abstention was {{exceptionally}} low, {{as well as}} protest votes.
