40|$|To report acute onset lens {{particle}} glaucoma {{associated with}} a spontaneous anterior capsular dehiscence. A 66 -yearold man presented with spontaneous anterior lens capsule dehiscence with an acute onset of right eye pain that was associated with white particles in the anterior chamber angle and intraocular pressure (IOP) of 55 mmHg. No trauma or other inflammatory antecedents were reported. A <b>hypermature</b> <b>cataract</b> was observed at slit lamp exam. After medical treatment without IOP control, we performed extracapsular cataract extraction and anterior vitrectomy. Anterior chamber aspirate confirmed the presence of macrophages. The postoperative IOP at one month was 16 mmHg OD without medication. Spontaneous dehiscence of the anterior lens capsule in a patient with a <b>hypermature</b> <b>cataract</b> may release lens cortical material, resulting in lens particle glaucoma.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness and security of lift and squeeze technique in phacoemulsification of <b>hypermature</b> <b>cataract.</b> METHODS: From June 2010 to June 2013, totally 156 eyes with <b>hypermature</b> <b>cataract,</b> which received phacoemulsification in our hospital, were enrolled. Lift and squeeze technique was used to chop the nucleus, and 1 g/L Trypan blue was used for capsulorhexis. Average time of phaco complication, corneal edema and visual outcome were recorded. RESULTS: The best-corrected visual acuity(BCVA) was 0. 1 - 0. 4 in 15 eyes(9. 6 %), 0. 5 - 0. 7 in 82 (52. 6 %) eyes, and 0. 8 - 1. 0 in 59 (37. 8 %) eyes at 3 mo after surgery. The phaco time was 25 - 56 s(average 42 ± 10 s), the maximum phaco power was 30 %. Posterior capsular rupture and vitreous loss happened in 2 eyes(1. 3 %), and the IOLs were implanted in the sulcus. Corneal edema classified at grade Ⅰ were seen in 12 eyes(7. 7 %), and 5 eyes(3. 2 %) at gradeⅡ, no eye at grade Ⅲ and grade Ⅳ. The mean endothelial cell loss was 8. 7 % at 3 mo.

Materials and methods: Two-hundred eyes of 200 patients presenting with a <b>hypermature</b> <b>cataract</b> underwent manual small incision cataract surgery. A single surgeon performed all surgeries under peribulbar anesthesia. After cortical clean-up, the capsular bag was inflated with viscoelastic. The {{presence or absence of}} opacity on the posterior lens capsule and location was noted. Postoperative follow-up was done for visual acuity and need for neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (ND:YAG) laser capsulotomy. Results: Primary PCO occurred in 76 eyes (incidence of 38 %). It was peripheral in 58 eyes (76. 3 %) and central in 18 eyes (23. 7 %). At 6 weeks postoperatively, best corrected visual acuity for eyes with central primary PCO (n = 18) was 0. 2 – 0. 3 logMAR and 0 – 0. 2 logMAR for eyes with peripheral primary PCO (n = 58). Best corrected visual acuity at the 6 - and 12 -month follow-up was 0 – 0. 2 logMAR in both groups. Fibrotic primary PCO was seen in four patients. No predilection for the development of primary PCO to a particular quadrant of posterior capsule was observed. At 1 year postoperatively, eleven (14. 5 %) patients required ND:YAG laser capsulotomy, six (7. 90 %) of whom underwent ND:YAG laser capsulotomy at the 6 -month follow-up. Seven patients with central primary PCO and four patients with peripheral primary PCO required ND:YAG laser capsulotomy. Conclusion: A high incidence of primary PCO was noted in rural patients with a hypermature senile cataract undergoing cataract surgery. No serious intraoperative complications were noted.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} was to {{overview}} the pathophysiology of the conventional outflow pathway, trabecular meshwork, and intraocular pressure and to discuss the options of future glaucoma treatment directed to improvement in aqueous outflow. The literature search in the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases from April to May 2012 was performed; a total of 47 articles analyzed. Diminished conventional pathway may be altered by several pathophysiological mechanisms like TM obstruction caused by transforming growth factor-β 2, clastic nondeformable cells, macrophages leaking from <b>hypermature</b> <b>cataract,</b> iris pigment, lens capsular fragments after YAG-laser posterior capsulotomy, proteins and their subfragments. It is known that trabecular meshwork contraction reduces outflow, and the actomyosin system is directly linked to this mechanism.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective observational study on 100 consecutive eyes of 100 patients with white cataract who had undergone MSICS with trypan blue assisted CCC. The nucleus was prolapsed into anterior chamber by using a sinskey hook and extracted out of the eye using irrigating vectis. Intraoperative and postoperative findings (according to OCTET classification) as well as postoperative visual outcomes were used as main measures to report {{the safety and}} efficacy of the surgery. RESULTS: Of the 100 eyes, 16 had intumescent, 67 had mature and 17 had <b>hypermature</b> <b>cataract.</b> Intraoperatively CCC was incomplete in 4 eyes (4 &#x 0025;) and had to be converted to canopener capsulotomy. None of the eyes had posterior capsular rupture or zonular dialysis and no eyes were converted to conventional Extra Capsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE). Postoperatively, 6 eyes (6 &#x 0025;) developed corneal oedema with > 10 Descemets folds and 7 eyes (7 &#x 0025;) had corneal oedema with < 10 Descemets folds. Mild iritis was seen in 6 eyes (6 &#x 0025;) and moderate iritis with fibrin membrane was seen in 3 eyes (3 &#x 0025;). Iridodialysis was observed in 1 eye (1 &#x 0025;).

Results Pseudoexfoliation was identified in eyes of 192 patients with overall incidence of 28. 19 %. It was found unilaterally in 46. 87 % and bilaterally in 53. 13 % of patients. The mean age for PXF group was 73. 47 ± 22. 36 years and 72. 36 ± 21. 63 years for non-PXF group. The occurrence of pseudoexfoliation {{was found to be}} significantly higher with advancement of age. Ocular hypertension and glaucoma were reported in PXF group more than in non-PXF group. Nuclear, <b>hypermature,</b> and cortical <b>cataracts</b> were found to be more frequently associated with pseudoexfoliation compared with those without pseudoexfoliation. Association of PXF with some ocular conditions as well as with perioperative complications was reported and discussed. Conclusion PXF is a common age-related disorder in patients with age-related cataract in Najran area, south Saudi Arabia with overall incidence of 28. 19 %. PXF was found to be associated with certain types of cataract, glaucoma, other ocular conditions as well as increased incidence of operative complications...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: to {{describe}} {{a case in which}} the diagnosis of Morganian cataract required clinical and instrumental differentiation from iris pathologies, including iris melanoma. Methods: a 60 -years-old Caucasian man referred to our institute for worsening of vision in last few months. Clinical evaluation consisted in complete ophthalmological assessment, ultrasound examination (biomicroscopy and 20 MHz), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) completed with Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI). Results: traumatic corneal wound of the left eye (LE) had occurred 5 years before, and was treated with medical therapy alone. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 3 / 10 in the right eye (RE) and finger count in the LE, with intraocular pressure at 13 and 20 mmHg, respectively. Chronic central serous chorioretinopathy, accounted for the low visual acuity of the RE. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the LE was as in Figure 1; LE fundus was not clinically observable. Despite MRI was compatible with an iris solid formation, characterized by contrast enhancement and hyperintense signal in SWI, ultrasound indicated rather a mixed solid and liquid content (moderately echogenic external layer, hyporeflective internal content). Iris root and ciliary body were not significantly altered; the lens showed inhomogeneous content. We considered Morgagnian cataract the most probable diagnosis. Surgery confirmed the presence of a <b>hypermature</b> <b>cataract</b> with prior anterior capsule fissuring; the liquefied cortex infiltrated the iris without anterior chamber seeping. Post-operative BCVA was 3 / 10 and fundus examination disclosed an advanced macular chronic central serous chorioretinopathy. Conclusions: In the reported case a previous perforating trauma have probably damaged the lens capsule and started cataract progression. Curiously cataract developed percolating into the iris stroma, thus simulating an iris mass. At our knowledge, Morgagnian cataract has never been included in the differential diagnosis of iris mass...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Severe {{bilateral}} cataract {{was found}} in a 7 year-old naïve female cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) 3 months before necropsy. During macroscopic examination, severe opacity and thinning of the lens were observed in both eyes. Histopathology revealed that the lens nuclei and majority of cortex lens fibers had disappeared and become excavated, while the lens fibers in the subcapsular area were swollen and distorted. Other observations included atrophy and vacuolation in the lens epithelial cells and proliferation of spindle cells and collagen fiber beneath the anterior capsule of the right eye. Immunohistochemical staining of these spindle cells revealed the presence of vimentin, cytokeratin and a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA), which were considered to be derived from lens epithelial cells. This is a rare case of spontaneous, bilateral, <b>hypermature</b> <b>cataract</b> in a cynomolgus monkey. (DOI: 10. 1293 /tox. 24. 69; J Toxicol Pathol 2010; 24 : 69 – 73) Key words: cynomolgus monkey, histopathology, hypermature cataracts Cataract is a common eye disease characterized by complete or partial loss of lens transparency. Various factors such as increasing age, exposure to ultraviolet light, trauma, atopic dermatitis, diabetes and genetics are thought {{to be related to the}} pathogenesis of cataract 1 – 7. The incidence of cataract in macaques is known to increase with age, similar to age-related cataract in humans 8, 9. However, all previously reported cases of spontaneous cataract in the cynomolgus monkey have been mild and have lacked histopathological descriptions. In this case report, we describe the histopathological changes in a 7 year-old naïve female cynomolgus monkey (M. fascicularis) with severe bilateral cataract. The cynomolgus monkey had been imported from China (Guangxi Grandforest Scientific Primate Co., Ltd., Guangxi, China) and used for breeding. All procedures involving the animal were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee o...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. Pseudoexfoliation {{syndrome}} (PEX) is an age-related systemic degenerative disorder {{characterized by}} the production and progressive accumulation of extracellular fibrillar eosinophilic material in the anterior segment of the eye. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate several clinical aspects of PEX, such as frequency of PEX and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PEXG), intraocular pressure (IOP), the type of lens opacity, and the possible relationship of PEX and systemic diseases. Methods. All 674 cataract patients had a comprehensive eye examination, including slitlamp biomicroscopy before and after mydriasis, IOP measurement, and fundus examination. The patients were classified into two groups: the PEX and the non-PEX group. Results. The overall prevalence of PEX syndrome was found to be 17. 5 % (118 patients). The mean age of PEX patients (79. 7 ± 6. 1 years) was significantly higher when compared with those without PEX (73. 5 ± 9. 1 years) (p = 0. 000). The prevalence of PEX syndrome was found to increase with age, from 7. 3 % in the 7 th decade of life to 27 % in patients older than 80 years (p < 0. 001). The most common cataract type in the PEX patients was mature cataract observed in 40. 7 % of patients. The rest of the patients had mixed (30. 5 %), nuclear (25. 4 %), cortical (1. 7 %) and <b>hypermature</b> <b>cataract</b> (1. 7 %). Among the PEX patients 44 (37. 2 %) had glaucoma. Intraocular pressure was significantly higher in eyes with pseudoexfoliations than in eyes without it (17. 8 ± 3. 2 mmHg and 15. 8 ± 2. 8 mmHg, respectively; p = 0. 001). Moreover, the prevalence of coronary heart disease was found to be higher in PEX patients. Conclusion. PEX syndrome is a common problem among Serbian patients scheduled for cataract surgery. It represents one of the major glaucoma risk factors and probably associated with ischemic heart disease, intraoperative and postoperative problems in cataract surgery...|$|E
